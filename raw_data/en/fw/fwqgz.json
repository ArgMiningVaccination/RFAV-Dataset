This publication, Trust, a Core Condition: Malm\u00f6 Art Academy 25 Years, serves a dual purpose: it is at once a manifestation of the artistic education and research that has and continues to happen at the Art Academy, and it is a Festschrift dedicated to Gertrud Sandqvist, made to honour her enormous efforts, her ingenious mind, and her crucial role in establishing and steering the Art Academy from the beginning. It also, and importantly so, celebrates the Art Academy's vision, its earned position as a strong and recognised player in the art field locally and internationally, the 540 artists who have graduated in these first twenty- five years, and the many Professors, Lecturers, Guest Teachers, and staff who contribute to and care for the Art Academy on a daily basis. On September 1, 1995, Malm\u00f6 Art Academy was inaugurated by Lund University, and its journey and development since then have proven to be strong and fruitful. The Art Academy has upheld its focus on and trust in the students' singular practices, its flexible education programme and workshops, its dedication to always being in sync with and actively engaged in the international art field, and its commitment to responding to the needs and currents of the time in which we live. A key figure in all this has been Gertrud Sandqvist, who at the end of 2020 will shift from her position as Rector and Artistic Director of the Art Academy to continue in her roles as Professor of Art Theory and the History of Ideas and as Supervisor of the Doctoral Programme. Sandqvist has been Rector since 2011, before which she was Head of Department from 1995 to 2007 . She also took part in the initial process of establishing the Art Academy long before its opening, building on the foundation created by the Forum painting and graphic schools (1961 - 95), from which some of the first students and faculty were transferred. She has always had a strong vision and sense of making the organism breathe, to use her own words. In a statement she made about the challenges that creating and developing artistic education holds, Sandqvist expresses this vision for the Art Academy very precisely: The absolute core condition for making an environment in which art can happen is trust. If anything, this type of environment is in danger in our contemporary societies, at least for us as educators. Maj Hasager, Matts Leiderstam and Marie ThamsForeword6We must be able to trust our artist-students. We must be able to trust our artist-teachers. We must dare to allow individual curricula to have long periods when seemingly nothing is happening. We must learn how to listen to the breath of creativity. We must facilitate this by allowing small unities, where people know each other and trust each other. We must dare to describe rather than prescribe. We must learn to recognise the signs that tell us when to act and when to wait. We must be able to consider an art academy as an organism rather than a structure.1 This publication is an initiative of the Faculty of Fine and Performing Arts, Lund University, and we who wrote this foreword took on the task of bringing it all together. As an editorial team, we wanted to gather some of the important voices and questions that have been and are part of the Art Academy's tissue, and to reflect on topics that are close to Gertrud Sandqvist's heart. Contributions arrived to us from an invited selection of notable artists, writers, and curators, all of whom have been part of the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy organism over the years, whether as students, Professors, or Guest Teachers. The result is a nuanced collection of twenty-five new and republished texts, lectures, and artworks. To begin, you will encounter texts dealing with some of the key questions in teaching that are especially relevant at the Art Academy. In his text \"Studio Visits, \" Matts Leiderstam, artist, former Professor, and now External Visiting Lecturer and Researcher, explores the importance and challenges of individual studio visits. This topic is further unfolded from a feminist perspective by legendary artist and former Guest Teacher Mary Kelly, in her text \"Concentric Pedagogy: Towards an Ethics of the Observer. \" In \"Collective Pockets of Dialogue: Between Practice, Pedagogy, and Critical Thinking, \" Maj Hasager, artist, Senior Lecturer, and Vice Rector, asks what happens when an art academy sets out to test formats across disciplines, using the specific example of her experience setting up the MFA in Critical & Pedagogical Studies. Questions of the possibility of defining one's own space is further refined in artist and former student Kajsa Dahlberg's work A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries, an artwork from 2006 that has been reworked for the context of this publication.7 Next comes a series of contributions that engage with the question: What is artistic practice and artistic knowledge production? The topic is first explored in the text \"Know-How and No-How: Stopgap Notes on 'Method' in Visual Art as Knowledge Production\" by Sarat Maharaj, distinguished writer and curator, Professor in Visual Art and Knowledge Systems, and Supervisor of the Doctoral Programme at the Art Academy. This is followed by the renowned art scholar, curator, and former Guest Teacher and External Examiner Lynne Cooke's text \"Suspended Stories: Rosa Barba's Strategic Narrativity\" on the practice of the artist Rosa Barba, who earned her PhD at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and Lund University in 2018 and is now External Visiting Lecturer. In his text \" A Layman's Chalice, \" Stephan M\u00f8ller, artist, former student, and now Guest Teacher, discusses current attitudes towards research and concepts of knowledge, as seen from his own artistic process and practice. Julie Ault, lauded artist, curator, and writer, who earned her PhD at the Art Academy in 2011, contributes \"Dishes, Diaries, and Cemeteries\" together with a selection of interview and text extracts, offering a sensitive perspective on archiving and her engagement with the artist collective Group Material, among other of her projects. Another strand of texts and artworks touches on various currents within the production of knowledge and subjectivities in the artistic field. The late influential critic and curator Okwui Enwezor looks at the intertwining of visual art, politics, and subjectivity in his text \"The Artist as Producer in Times of Crisis, \" based on a lecture he gave at the Art Academy sixteen years ago. Hans Hamid Rasmussen, well-known artist and former Guest Teacher, offers a personal entry into questions of belonging and the construction of collective memories in his text \"Kasbah Walking III, Taking Photographs and Making Embroidery. \" Questions of colonialism, power structures, and their expression and presence in and through art are nuanced by former student and now experienced curator, writer, and educator \u00d6v\u00fcl \u00d6. Durmusoglu in her text \"We Are Each Other's Air, \" on the work of Runo Lagomarsino, who also studied at the Art Academy. Following this is the presentation of the project The Anti-Apartheid Room: The World Turned Upside Down: Art and Ethics in the Rise of the \"Stone Age South\", which took place at the Art Academy in 2017 and covers questions around migration, cosmic awakening, women in historical accounts of apartheid, and the de colonisation of knowledge production. An important aspect of this project, which consisted of multiple lectures, workshops, and more, revolved around the reconstruction of the so-called Art History Room at the University of South Africa (circa 1971), resulting in the Anti- Apartheid Room in Malm\u00f6, by artists accompanied by a text by Professor Sarat Maharaj, who initiated the project. Maj Hasager, Matts Leiderstam and Marie Thams8 In the middle section of the book, a more personal tone emerges. It begins with a letter to Gertrud Sandqvist from her long-time collaborator, the curator and educator J\u00fcrgen Bock, which is followed by contributions from Olav Christopher Jenssen and Lars Nilsson, both renowned artists and former External Visiting Lecturer and Professor, respectively. Jenssen contributes a drawing sequence, Progressive Symbolic Dynamic Drawing for Gertrud Sandqvist, and Nilsson shares his fond memories of the very first days of the Art Academy. All three offer insightful dialogues close to heart and mind. In a continuation of this tone, art historian, director of Lunds konsthall, and Sandqvist's frequent collaborator \u00c5sa \"Malm\u00f6 Art Academy at Lunds konsthall, \" describes a series of exhibitions at the konsthall made in collaboration with the Art Academy, pointing at the importance of the presence of the school both in the artistic field and in the local community. Following this section is a series of texts on some streams within contemporary art that have marked the period in which the Art Academy has been operating. Silja Rantanen, one of Finland's pioneering con ce ptual painters and former Guest Teacher, reflects on the importance of the conceptual approach in her text \"What Does a Conceptual Artwork Look Like?\" In a lecture he gave during the very first years of the Art Academy, the late renowned artist and former Guest Teacher Ola Billgren asks: \"Why [has there been] so much work on an attempt to define a specific artistic language, and why does language become the object of exclusive, personal possession?\" Independent curator, writer, critic, and former Guest Teacher Mark Kremer, in his text \"Performance, Politics, Fiction, \" unfolds questions of what makes a radical practice and what the role of performance has been since the 1970s. Next come two performative works. In Two Instruction Pieces by Leif Holmstrand and a Documentation Photo of a Seemingly Unrelated Piece Performed at Zarya Czenter for Contemporary Art in Vladivostok by Leif Holmstrand, artist, writer, musician, and former student, we are taken on a sensuous bodily journey. Meanwhile, artist, writer, and current student in the Art Academy's new MFA in Artistic Research Karin Hald invites us on a spiritual walk in Ritual for Pilgrims. Looking at the aims and challenges of art education both locally and internationally, influential curator and former Guest Teacher Ute Meta Bauer's text \"Under Pressure\" sheds critical light tration of current market logics. Anders Kreuger, Head of Department and Director of the Art Academy in 2007 - 10 and international curator, writer, and educator, explores the experience of teaching from the perspective of a curator in his text \"Thinking about Thinking Together. \" Extending further into questions of teaching conditions, specifically in relation to feminism, privilege, and patriarchal structures, acclaimed 9artist and former Professor Andrea Geyer contributes with the text \"Notes on Teaching, Art, and Feminism. \" Finally, current Guest Teacher and performance-based artist Michael Portnoy, in the text \"On Embodiment and Joy, \" reflects on embodiment and collaboration by looking back at a specific workshop he ran with students from Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and Malm\u00f6 Theatre Academy in 2020. A warm thank you goes out to all the authors and artists for your enthusiasm in contributing your writing and work and taking part in this celebration of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. A big thank you also goes to those authors and publishers who granted the Art Academy permission to re publish existing texts, including Anita Billgren, who has kindly allowed us to republish Ola Billgren's lecture from 1996, and Chika Okeke-Agulu, who generously gave permission to reprint Okwui Enwezor's lecture from 2004. Our gratitude also goes to Dean Anna Lyrevik and the rest of the Faculty Office for initiating this celebration and supporting the production of this publication, and to Art Academy Director Silvana Hed for her kind support. Thank you to Programme Administrator Evalena Tholin for her help in gathering the needed information, Eller med a for designing this beautiful publication, Jaclyn Arndt for copyediting, Jan Salomonsson for translating, and Francis Patrick Brady for proofreading. We would also like to extend our thanks to some important key individuals who were instrumental in bringing Malm\u00f6 Art Academy into existence twenty-five years ago: Johan Bengt-P\u00e5hlsson, Deputy Mayor for Culture for the City of Malm\u00f6 (1991 - 94); Bodil Flodgren, Vice- Chancellor of Lund University (1992 - 2002); and Peter Honeth, Director of Lund Univer - sity (1990 - 2006). Two more notables should be mentioned in this context: Sten \u00c5ke Nilsson, Professor Emeritus of Art History at Lund University, and, last but not least, H\u00e5kan Lundstr\u00f6m, our former Dean and now Senior Professor of Music and Society at Malm\u00f6 Academy of Music. This book of course would not have been possible in the first place without all the staff members at Lund University who not only supported Malm\u00f6 Art Academy in its very beginnings but have given their continuing support ever since. Finally, a deep felt thank you to Gertrud Sandqvist for her significant role in establishing and forming Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. We are all excited to follow its onward journey. \u2014 Maj Hasager, Matts Leiderstam, and Marie Thams Sandqvist, statement for \"Panel 21: Art / Education in the 21st Century, \" Front Lines, How Might We T alk about the Future? symposium, organised by China Academy of Art and National Institute of Art, Beijing, March 2018. 11Malm\u00f6 Art Academy 1995 - 2020 This timeline highlights major developments at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy together with a selection of external activities.

Courtesy of the artist23\"I'm sitting in a student's studio, listening to a lament about a fire and a recently deceased father, about petrification, but also about the choice to carry on. I look at a series of paintings of little people, flags, and then, across the hallway: pine cones arranged in long rows, a natural presence, cut up and frozen, laid out in lines. At night, I dream that my entire studio is full of fried herrings. I pull open drawers, and everywhere I look: rows of neatly placed herrings. \" Kent Lindfors, one of my teachers at Valand Academy in Gothenburg, wrote those words about his studio visits in the 1986 edition of the school's annual exhibition catalogue.1 It strikes me that it's been many years since I last read Lindfors's essay, and that I'd forgotten that he wrote about my pine cones. When I lived in Gothenburg, I sometimes picked up men in Kungsparken at night. Life was fragile, and the pine cones carried an erotic significance that I was unaware of at the time. This was when the AIDS crisis was peaking \u2014 some of my friends and past lovers died. It wasn't until a few years later, in the early 1990s, that my artworks began to address my own queer reality openly, and the AIDS epidemic began to fade away when the first effective anti retroviral treatments appeared in 1996. As I write these words, we are once again living with restrictions because of a pandemic, and I find myself wondering if this virus will have a similar impact on us \u2014 and on art.Studio Visits Matts Leiderstam 20201 Matts Leiderstam24 The philosopher of art Larry Shiner has written about an interesting change in the role of the artist that occurred during a time of transition in Western civilisation: 1680-1830, when the work of artists was redefined and set apart from that of craftspeople.2 A few years ago, I assigned a group of students from Malm\u00f6 Art Academy a few chapters of reading from Shiner's book. I asked them to look particularly closely at a table that lays out how these concepts changed as a result of transitioning from the old system of art production and art reception to a new one: From the \"Piece\" to the \"Work\": Two Systems of Art Production and Reception3 Old \" Art\" System New \"Fine Art\" System Aspect (Patronage / Commission) (Free Market) Production Concrete labor Abstract labor Product Piece Work Representation Imitation Creation Reception Use; enjoyment Exchange; contemplation Next, I asked the students to come up with suggestions for concepts that matched their own ideas about what they did as artists, and they produced the following: Production = research Product = project Representation = practice Reception = participation25One thing I'm sure of: if they had asked me the same question when I was an art student back in the 1980s, my answers would have been closer to the late eighteenth-century notion of what a fine artist does. Have we gone through another shift in our perceptions of what artists do? In this text, I won't seek to give definitive answers to that question; rather, I'll focus on the studio visit as a teaching method and the change that the conversations had during these visits have undergone during my own lifetime. Before my first studio visit, I received tutoring from my first painting teachers, the artists Birgit St\u00e5hl- Nyberg and Hendrik Nyberg, who taught me to plot a grid as follows: a rectangular surface is diagonally intersected from corner to corner, and then divided by a vertical line and a horizontal line, both running through the cross that has been produced at the centre of the surface by the diagonals. The same procedure is then repeated with each of the four rectangles that this first step produces. You continue dividing the rectangle until you've split it into sixty- four squares. This way, you'll have given yourself an aid that can help you analyse and organise your painting. This method has ties to modernist pedagogy, which was based on cubism, as well as to far older crafts traditions that originated during the Italian Renaissance. This structure has accompanied me throughout my career, and I've used it in many ways in my works.4 When I introduced this grid to some of my students at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, I found to my surprise that hardly any of them had seen it before. This has caused me to wonder which aspects of classic craft knowledge have been retained and which have been forgotten, as well as to ponder the impact that the new digital grid might be having on contemporary art. In connection with my own artistic research into these grids, I've carried out a series of interviews with painters from different generations, all of whom teach or have taught before, and most of them with experience at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm and Valand Academy in Gothenburg.5 The stated subject for these inter - views was the grid, but we also touched on the practical realities of teaching artists. For all of us, studio visits have been a core element of our approaches and teaching \u2014 we've had countless such meetings, both as students and as teachers. In the interviews, those of my colleagues who belong to my own generation confirmed my suspicion that we had all experi- enced the same manner of teaching at our preparatory art schools.6 This didactic approach is based in French modernism, at least as interpreted within a Scandinavian context. It involves a style of studio conversation that resembles the way Henri Matisse taught at Acad\u00e9mie Matisse in Paris in the early twentieth century. Several Swedes and Norwegians attended the academy, and many of them 1 Matts Leiderstam26went on to play influential roles in Scandinavian art education.7 The method was as follows: the students worked in a communal studio, making studies of nude models. The teacher would walk from easel to easel, giving the students individual critiques. Some- times, the whole group would walk along after him, so they could all benefit from his wisdom. This was where the \"correct\" manner of vision was practised, through collective form exercises that all revolved around croquis drawing. In this teaching situation, the teacher was still expected to correct the students' work, either by demonstrating how it ought to be done in their own sketchbook or by manually altering the painting or sculpture the student was working on. Although a less authoritarian teaching style had taken hold in the preparatory art schools by the 1980s, we were still taught to suppress anything that might be taken to be a personal expression, and instead directed to seek \"signs\" of what we were seeing (the model or the still life).8 It was only after our initiation into the basic secrets of volume, line, surface, colour, and composition that we were permitted to work on our own subjects. The most important piece of knowledge of all, as I recall, was the one about volume: how to translate the three dimensions of the body to the two dimen- sions of the paper. I can still recall the moment when I understood the technique and how my vision subsequently changed.9 When we exchanged JPEG images of our works from those days, some of my colleagues remarked that they genuinely looked like they had been made by the same artist. They were the kinds of sketches and paintings we were expected to use in our applications to art schools. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the predecessor of the Royal Institute of Art, the Royal Art Academy in Stockholm, has been influenced by the pedagogies of the German art academies, in which students are invited to go and work in the professors' studios. This educational model was developed within the new system of fine art, which Shiner describes in his book, but remained rooted in the old system, where apprentices worked in the master's workshop. That model is now, in 2020, almost completely extinct in Scandinavia, with the exception of Denmark. For a time, I took an interest in the D\u00fcsseldorf Art Academy, more specifically, in one of the school's periods of exceptional greatness, when Johann Wilhelm Schirmer instated a landscape painting class.10 In his role as professor, he developed his own teaching method that revolved around his studio at the school. One important component of this involved the students learning by copying the professor's nature studies, which were kept in a room adjacent to the studio. The students, 27of whom a large number were from Sweden and Norway, would only, after having demonstrated their skill at copying, be trusted to head out and make their own drawings and oil sketches in nature \u2014 detailed studies of plants, trees, water, and rocks. In this way, they would acquire a mental archive of natural elements for use in future landscape compo- sitions. Actually creating ambitious landscape paintings was reserved for the final stages of the students' time at the academy. Several artists belonging to my teachers' generation, who I also interviewed, offered nostalgic accounts of the time they spent as students at the Royal Art Academy in the 1960s and '70s, when much of the master-apprentice teaching style of the nineteenth-century art academies remained in vogue. They studied under their professor, and rarely had access to any of the other professors at the school.11 At that time, students used to work in the available studios within the professor's department \u2014 several students would often share a single room. One-to-one conversations were usually initiated by the profes- sor, and sometimes they would be held in the presence of the rest of the group. A couple of my col- leagues related public humiliations endured at the hands of either the professor or other students in the class. Some professors de livered authoritarian corrections, while others took on more fatherly roles and delivered their advice with great care. Common to all was the idea that working hard in the studio was important \u2014 as was, I must add: being white, masculine, and heterosexual. It wasn't uncommon for the male professors to have romantic relationships with their female students. No female profes- sor was appointed at a Swedish art academy until the 1980s.12 In that decade, the one when my generation was applying to art academies, the work samples requested were still largely model paintings and croquis drawings. It was recommended that we continue the practice of croquis, to maintain our vision \u2014 similar to the way a musician practices drills of scales, we were to practise our vision constantly. Apart from that, being left alone to work in the studio was regarded as the most important aspect of the pedagogical approach. But if an opportunity to meet with a teacher presented itself, a re- warding studio visit could help you progress in your work. It also rep- resented an opportunity to receive confidence- inducing praise or severe judgement; some tutors thought of \"breaking\" a student as just part of the method, as they had all been subjected to the same treatment. My interviewees claimed that almost all studio conversations concerned the works that were physically present in the studio. Usually, the conversation would be about form (organisation of colour, line, light, and shade, for example) and whether artworks were \"good\" or \"bad. \" The art context, the concepts that inform the work, and the effect the work 1 Matts Leiderstam28has in the exhibition space were all topics less often discussed. In the mid-1980s, the boundaries between the different traditional technical domains of painting, printmaking, and sculpture began to dissolve. Art academy education was further broadened in the late 1980s, when video and photography began to be taught. The students also gained greater influence over teacher appointments, and occasional guest lecturers who broke with the norm began to make appearances. Many of my interview subjects described the independent emergence of a peer-education culture inside the studios, where as students they had discussions about current exhibitions and differ - ent writings they came across (post modernism and psychoanalysis were all the rage, as I recall). Many of us were already undertaking our own initiatives while we were still at school, opening artist-run galleries and holding exhibitions in temporary spaces \u2014 a trend that only intensified in the 1990s. Several of my colleagues singled out a specific professor, Marie-Louise Ekman, and highlighted the change in tone in studio con- versations that she brought about after being appointed professor of painting at the Royal Institute of Art in 1984. In a radio programme from August 2020, Ekman describes the studio visits she made in the 1980s: \"What do you do to help somebody who wants to do something, but doesn't know how, to find a way, or a language, a mode of expression, that suits this particular individual, with their specific background and experiences? How do you speak to each other? What words do you use? What is the nature of the teacher- student encounter? Is it a case of a superiority versus in- feriority, or do you find an approach that makes the power balance less significant?\"13 Ekman's words describe a development in the student- teacher relationship that began at this time, and which made the teacher's role more akin to that of a sounding board, therapist, or even co-creator of sorts. This teaching role is far removed from the patriarchal, correcting master who dominated the academies for so long. When I left Valand Academy in 1989, the ideal career trajectory for a Swedish artist followed a long-established path: get rep- resented by one of the most prestigious galleries in Stockholm, get reviewed in Dagens Nyheter, produce a travelling exhibition and tour the institutions in smaller towns, do a solo at Malm\u00f6 Konst- hall, and, finally, have your big retro spective at Moderna Museet in Stockholm. After this, career success was fully confirmed by an appointment to a professorship at the Royal Institute of Art, a medal from the king, and a seat in the Royal Academy of Fine Arts. Show - ing your art outside Scandinavia was a rare occurrence, and, if it happened at all, it would be organ- ised by a Swedish or Scandinavian 29art institution. An artist who rep- resented the nation in the Nordic Pavilion in Venice like this would be laurelled. By the time the mid-1990s came around, things had been grad- ually turned on their head through a series of smaller increments, and the art world and the art market both became more international than ever. Sweden joined the EU, and a whole new generation of artists, curators, writers, and gallery owners, as well as the founding of IASPIS, the International Artists Studio Program in Stockholm, all contribut- ed to this move from the local to the global.14 The emergence of a growing number of new art insti- tutions, biennials, and art fairs gave artists from all over the world access to a larger stage.15 Mean- while, significant steps were made on the path from analogue to digital technology \u2014 the fax machine entered the studio first, soon to be followed by the computer and the smartphone. A far more commu- nicative and self-reflective artist role than the one I was trained to fill was dawning: the new artist spoke English and was expected to work on the global art scene. Croatian artist Mladen Stilinovi made inspired fun of this new artist's role with his An Artist Who Cannot Speak English Is No Artist (1992). When Malm\u00f6 Art Academy was founded in 1995, the stated ambition was to create an education for the international artist, and the most important challenge faced by the school's newly appointed board was that of turning the patriarchal structures of professorial educa- tion on their head and allowing the students to \"take the responsibility for their own artistic development by designing their course of study. \"16 Different varieties of knowledge and experience were to be mixed together, to \"get away from unfor - tunate boundaries between tech- niques, between theory and practice, and between different areas of knowledge. \"17 The ambition was to found a school that would both address and problematise the role of the artist, and provide the tools that artists need to work in dependently within the global art scene. In 1997 , I began to teach at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, where I have remained ever since, except for a leave of absence I took to pursue my own doctoral studies. I've spent most of my time here teaching and mentoring in the BFA and MFA programmes.18 When the school first opened its premises, in an old elementary school house on F\u00f6reningsgatan 42, the students all received their own studios, which they could lock and had free access to at any time of day. The decision was also made to have the students invite the teachers to their studios, rather than doing it the other way round. No teacher would have keys to, or find reason to enter, the studios unless the students gave their permission. The basic purpose of the studio visits was expressed by the school's Rector: \"What passes in the meeting 1 Matts Leiderstam30between student and tutor may be a strain on both, or thrill for both, but it is never less than stimulating, \" and further, \"This is where the artistic experience is passed on and transformed, from one genera- tion to the next. \"19 In contrast with the narrow- minded, provincial view on art that dominated during my own education, contemporary art around the turn of the millennium could be described as a platform for experiments of form and perception or sociological and political investi- gations. With an art concept this broad, it followed that the teaching of artists would have to be broad- ened. Unlike the earlier, crafts- focused art education, which was divided into subcategories like painting, sculpture, and print making, fine art now encompassed any variety of two- or three-dimensional spatial expression, such as per - formance, installation, concept art, \"new media, \" activism, photography, video, and film. Art theory, philoso- phy, and critical studies \u2014 all subjects that would once have been viewed as exclusively academic \u2014 have made their way into the curricula of art academies. These new requirements made it obvious that art students needed to practise their ability to express ideas related to their practice in writing and in conversation, and that it would be expected of them that they be able to relate their own practice to the approaches of other artists, both contemporary and historical. These expectations caused some change in the con- versations in the studios \u2014 students soon learned to provide succinct descriptions of their practices and apply a more project-like structure to their work for their graduation exhibitions. When Malm\u00f6 Art Academy abandoned the old structure of the art academies, with five-year programmes, and moved to running its BFA and MFA programmes in accordance with the Bologna Process, studio visits became more purpose oriented: mentoring for the graduation show and graduation itself became a greater priority. The doctoral programme in artistic research has also influenced the BFA and MFA programmes. In purely concrete terms, students have learned to formulate project descriptions, and many of them have started to speak about their works as though they are research findings. Today, much of the actual teaching is done in English, and art history and theory have become important components of the edu- cation. Professors and teachers on half- and part-time contracts are more common, because full-time teaching is almost impossible to combine with an international career in art. Many faculty members live elsewhere, and they visit Malm\u00f6 to teach during focused blocks of time. We've also found it necessary to offer classes and workshops on many different techniques, as the students tend to develop a diverse array of practices. An abundance of guest tutors (curators, critics, 31and other individuals from the art world) visit the school, and our students learn to receive critique from them and present their works to them in their studios. We also arrange lectures from researchers and thinkers in other fields relevant to art \u2014 postcolonial studies, socio- logy, archival research, philosophy, film studies, performance theory, and gender and queer theory, to mention just a few examples. Group seminars and group critiques have become more common at both the BFA and MFA levels, but the one-on-one conversation in the studio remains the foundation of much of the tuition, and it is entirely essential for graduation-project mentoring. It's not as though you're done with studio visits when you graduate from school: presenting and discussing our works in the presence of curators, writers, and colleagues is part of our job. Applying for studio grants or working in other cultural contexts and other parts of the world for varying periods of time has become a way of life for many artists today. There's even a tongue-in-cheek term used to describe these working conditions: \"residency hopping. \" On top of this, it's very common for artists to work in communally maintained and operated studio buildings. Historically, the painter's or sculptor's studio was, more than anything, a practical workshop for experi- mentation and production. Today, an artist's studio is equally their office, from where they administer their production and their practice. My own studio is divided into two rooms: one where I paint and try out different ways of installing; this is also where I show visitors my works. The back room has a desk, which is where I'm writing these words, a bookshelf, my filing cabinet, and my inventory of artworks in storage. A student's studio also tends to serve all these functions, although to varying extents. Perhaps, though, we're facing a shift, one in which the importance of the studio will be challenged by other kinds of spaces. The Norwegian artist Ane Hjort Guttu, who is also a professor at the Oslo Academy of the Arts, wrote in Kunstkritikk about the new art school buildings that have either recently been built or are still at the blueprint stage.20 The old fine arts academies are being combined with other arts education programmes to form Anglo-Saxon-style campuses. Apart from being a money-saver, this model inspires visions of the creative exchanges that might occur between students of various disci- plines in shared workshops, libraries, teaching spaces, and project rooms. Guttu describes how these ideas are translated into spaces, and about new kinds of larger workspace for projects: the project hall and the entrance hall. These are designed as central, large passageways, much like the indoor squares one finds in large office buildings and shopping centres \u2014 rooms that are expected to be filled by temporary collaborations 1 Matts Leiderstam32and workshops for all passers-by to see. \"First and foremost, how- ever, \" Guttu writes, \"these areas express an ideology of openness, interdisciplinarity, flexibility, and co operation associated with the 'sharing economy. '\"21 Workshops, seminar rooms, and teaching rooms, as well as offices for administrators and teachers, are all well planned and well placed within an easily surveyable architecture. Guttu claims that the people who planned these school buildings had a particular artist role in mind \u2014 one that defines their artistic work as a form of research. However, this imagined researcher is the creative entre- preneur or project manager type, who essentially needs nothing but their computer to work and who doesn't mind working in an open- office layout or \"learning landscape. \" Comparisons might be drawn to the architecture chosen by major IT businesses like Google, Apple, and various gaming studios in recent years \u2014 open spaces that are expected to boost creativity. A common issue shared by many of these new facilities relates to the individual studios used by students of fine arts: either no plans have been made for such studios, or they exist but are too office-like and too small. In some of these schools, the students have had to insist that studios be built after the fact using room dividers. When Lund University was planning Malm\u00f6 Art Academy's move to new, tempo- rary premises a few years ago, the school's board, along with the faculty and students, united to emphasise the importance of pro viding a functional work room for each of the school's fine arts students. In many ways, the new studios in B\u00e5ghallarna are actually more suitable than the ones in the old building on F\u00f6reningsgatan. Since Malm\u00f6 Art Academy will be moving again in a few years, to a campus building that is to be shared with Malm\u00f6 Theatre Academy and Malm\u00f6 Academy of Music, the issue of student studio layouts will no doubt become a renewed concern. When hosting the radio programme Sommar (Summer), Marie- Louise Ekman asked: \"How do you speak to each other? What words do you use? What is the nature of the teacher-student encounter?\"22 I see a clear change here compared to when I first be- came a student myself, more than forty years ago. Because the students meet with so many differ - ent people in their studios, they don't seem to suffer the same awkwardness I did in attempting to explain my artistic ambitions to my teachers, and I'm usually treated to a slick, well-rehearsed pitch of their practice. It's quite common for us to spend the first studio visit going over a number of works the student has made and to have them present their method and their intentions to me. Both of us take the young artist and their work to be the focal point of the studio conversation. They were the one who invited me into their workroom, 33after all. Those are the conditions, and the student's practice and works set the tone. In other words, they decide what I get to see and what we will talk about. I ask questions about what I see or hear, and try to hold back my own associations until I feel confident that I'm genuinely on to something. I deliberately avoid judgements like \"successful, \" \"good, \" and \"bad. \" Rather, I discuss different possi- bilities and directions to try to help the students become aware of the choices they've made. I largely trust in my gut instincts and the experience I've developed from viewing a lot of art and working on my own art \u2014 but I also lean on the experiences that I've made discussing art with many young artists over the years. These conversations can evolve very differently depending on the needs of the specific situation and how well the student and I know each other. Some relation- ships deepen over time, and we begin to meet more frequently. Perhaps, if sufficient trust develops between us, they will choose me to be their mentor for their final-year art project, which leads up to their graduation exhibition. Other studio visits will be more sporadic affairs. The students have many teachers to turn to, and perhaps they will feel more closely aligned with an- other artistic position \u2014 or perhaps a student might seek out a certain teacher based on their particular skill set. In recent years, the internet- connected computer and smart- phone have become core teaching tools. In the interviews with my colleagues, they confirmed my own view that the dialogue in the studios has become more dynamic as a result of our being a mere push of a button away from ac- cessing references or images that have immediate relevance to our conversation. We can also view the student's documentation or works together on a computer screen or smartphone. Some students have websites where they post their works, and others share their practice on social media. Links to texts, films, and artworks are sent back and forth between us, before and after the conver - sations. Studio visits can be com- plemented with remote follow-up meetings \u2014 which I usually do from the computer in my own studio. During the spring term of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic was raging, carrying out studio visits through Zoom became a common practice. Digitalisation has dissolved the studio space and changed the way artists work. How does this impact studio conversations and the artist's studio itself? That's hard to say, but we know one thing for sure: whenever we go through a technological shift, we always lose something important that we perhaps should have kept. I'd still like to endorse the value of the locked, private studio, the \"room of one's own, \" as the novelist Virginia 1 Leiderstam341 1986). 2 Larry The Invention of Art: A Cultural History ( Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001). 3 Shiner designed this table based on French literary historian Annie Becq's ideas on the transition from patronage to market as a move from \"concrete labour\" to \"abstract labour, \" necessitated by the shift from use-value to exchange-value. 4 \"Vad g\u00f6r rutn\u00e4tet?\" (What does the grid do?) was the title of my research project and, simultaneously, the complex research question I have posed in relation to painting and new technology, based on my art practice and past experience teaching artists. I've worked on this project at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy since 2019, with funding from the Swedish Research Council. The project will end in December 2021, when it will result in an exhibition and a book. 5 My interview subjects were Ewa Brodin, 6 There have been a number of preparatory art schools in Scandinavia for some time. For example, Gerlesborgsskolan, Pernbys m\u00e5larskola, and Konstskolan Idun Lov\u00e9n KV Konstskola and G\u00f6teborgs konstskola in Gothenburg. T o stand a chance at gaining admission to the art academies, most students will first get their basic education in these preparatory schools. 7 I'll relate it in reverse chronological order to reveal the connection: my teachers, who taught me the grid technique in 1977 , were Birgit St\u00e5hl Nyberg Nyberg under Ragnar Sandberg at the Royal Academy in Stockholm; Sandberg, in turn, studied under T or Bjurstr\u00f6m at Valand Konstskola in Gothenburg; and Bjurstr\u00f6m studied under Henri Matisse at Acad\u00e9mie Matisse in Paris in 1909. The catalogue for the Inspiration Matisse exhibition at Waldemarsudde, Stockholm, contains several written accounts of the teaching at the Acad\u00e9mie Matisse. Anna Meister, Daniel Prydz, and 2014).Woolf put it, which has as its main virtue the simple fact that other people can't see inside. Here, the artist-student is free to experiment and fail, and, most importantly of all, to not have to face judgement during the actual execution. In my experience, interesting and innovative artworks often result from some errant thought or bodily impulse \u2014 a motion that occurs before any thought about what the artwork is and does has fully formed. It is these attempts to define what art can be and do that become the subject of our discussions in the studios \u2014 and that's what makes this kind of conversation such an important and wonderful experience.358 T wo important books for this pedagogical approach were published by Bj\u00f6rn Melin, a painting teacher at Gerlesborgsskolan in Stockholm: M\u00e5la se (Stockholm: (Stockholm: Wahlstr\u00f6m & Widstrand, 1979). 9 Last autumn, when I returned to lecture at a preparatory art school in Stockholm, I took a walk among the easels to get a closer look at the depictions of the model's current pose. Everything was just the same as I remembered it in that room\u2014but also, I realised, upon looking closer at the students' paintings, so very different. The awareness of volume seemed to have been forgotten, or deemed insignificant\u2014all the figures in the paintings were flat, like paper dolls. But perhaps it only seemed that way to me? 10 I explored this in my postdoctoral project, Neanderthal Landscape, Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, 2009-10, and a related exhibition at Kunsthalle D\u00fcsseldorf in 2010. For more information on the project, see Matts Leiderstam, \"Neanderthal Landscape \u2014 After the Dissertation, \" MaHKUzine: Journal of Artistic Research, no. 10 (Summer 2011). 11 For more information on Swedish art education, I refer the reader to art historian Marta Edling's interesting research on education in fine arts from to 1995: Maria Pettersson was appointed a professorship from 1983 to 1986 at the Royal Institute of Art in Stockholm. According to Marta Edling, Marie-Louise Ekman was the first woman to be recruited for a professorship at the Royal Institute of Art. 13 Marie-Louise Ekman, Sommar, radio broadcast, SR, originally aired August 9, 2020, https://sverigesradio.se/sida/avsnitt/ 1518810?programid=2071.

So I will focus, briefly and schematically, on one of the central curricular components of studio art in an institutional context, that is, the critique, and my revision of it, dubbed matter-of-factly \"the method\" by students in the Whitney Museum's Independent Study Program in New York and the Interdisciplinary Studio area at the University of California, Los Angeles, as well as the graduate program of the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. Let me begin with an anecdote. When I went to teach at the California Institute of the Arts as a visiting artist in 1987, Michael Asher was giving his legendary critique session, which put the artist in the hot seat, subject to rigorous interrogation for hours on end. At the same time, I was introducing my version of the \"close reading,\" with viewers huddled in Concentric Pedagogy: Towards an Ethics of the Observer Mary Kelly20182 Mary KellyThis text is an amended version of a talk presented at the Whitney Independent Study Program's 50th Anniversary Symposium, Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, October 18-20, 2018. Reprinted by permission of the author.38a circle and the artist an observer at the periphery. As the term went on, students started joking about it: \"Are you taking the 'phallo centric' crit or the 'concentric' crit?\" That was when I first started to think more self-consciously about my pedagogy's relation to feminism. One of the primary imperatives for feminists in the 1970s was that we not speak for others. Because of my exposure to the practice of listening in consciousness-raising groups and the non- hierarchical forms of organisation that we practised in the London Women's Liberation Workshop, I was disposed to question the prevailing method of critique in art schools at that time. At Goldsmiths, where I was then teaching, this meant asking the artist to explain his or her intentions, which prompted a massive amount of projection on the part of the viewers such as, \"Why did you do this?\" or \"I would have done that,\" which seemed to overlook the fact that the work of art is essentially a visual proposition. As a signifying system, that pro- position is legible on its own terms, and the artist's verbal defence does not necessarily give him or her a voice. Instead, I felt we had to look, and to understand this looking as a form of listening to the artist through the work. Moreover, I began to think that not to do so was, in some sense, unethical. For the philosopher Giorgio Agamben, there is a certain kind of mediality that evades the orbit of means and ends. Nothing is produced or en acted. Instead, something is supported or endured, and this stance without purpose, he suggests, allows the ethical dimension of human experience to unfold.1 But as often occurs in a critique, looking at art becomes entangled with making it, and we reach an impasse. Whatever drives an artist's truth procedure verges on a certain kind of terror; that is, the passionate 39fidelity to an idea that is necessary to enact it. Yet this seems to be precisely what must be relinquished to be an ethical observer. Unlike what we typically think of as a critical engage- ment with the work, the ethical stance rejects judgement in favour of anticipation, and this in turn has implications for the process of deci- pherment. In my teaching practice over the years, this has entailed rethinking the question of spectatorship as a subject position distinct from the producer and his or her creative process. Anticipation is crucial to the formation of this psychic disposition. Here I am thinking not only of the psychoanalytic meaning of the term but also of philosophical formulations like those of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, who describes wonder as anterior to passion because it has no opposite and no affect. We are simply astonished by our encounter with the object. Extending his argument from a feminist perspective, Luce Irigaray says we wonder before judging and, in doing so, open ourselves up to difference without divisive hierarchies.2 In the crit class, we might not be astonished by the object, but the suspension of aims might endow us with the generosity required to proceed. We are just looking, trying not to read the wall text, or to think about who the artist is, or what we will be doing after class, but simply making ourselves vulnerable or open to the situation. The object encounter may or may not be what we want it to be, but both projection and introjection foreclose the possibility of knowing what it is. To decipher a visual pro- position, first it is necessary to acknowledge its difference unconditionally. The postcolonial and literary theorist Gayatri Spivak has identified the violence of interpretation and forced analogies, and I would argue that the process of decipherment must be not an interpretation but rather a careful 2 Mary Kelly40transcription of the signifying system of the work, the outcome of which surprises us and, occasionally, even the artist.3 The critique, as I have structured it, resembles psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan's \"three times of analysis\": seeing, understanding, and con cluding. But to witness the full \"aha effect\" of that surprise at the conclusion, it is imperative, in the beginning, for the tactic of close reading to remain open for as long as possible by focusing on the mater iality of the signifier, slowing down the quick fix of the signified and the headlong rush to the sign. In the very first instant of seeing, some- thing physical or somatic is registered in the body as a set of signifying relations to a specific object. Elements such as lighting, sound, scale \u2014 every- thing up to and including the frame or its absence (or, if it's an installation that includes the spec tator, its extension) \u2014 define the encounter primarily as a phenomenological event. But it is much like the future perfect tense in the lan- guage of the unconscious: inflected by an imag- inary certainty still to come but at the same time affecting the present. That is to say, we bring to the initial encounter a set of already received ideas that constitute another kind of frame. Here the scope of our interrogation is limited to the \"global\" (as opposed to Spivak's notion of \"planetarity\") because art schools are currently circumscribed by disciplinary practices that reflect the orbit of investment capital and Eurocentric genealogies of fine art. But importantly, as literary scholar Emily Apter has pointed out, artists do not necessarily reproduce imperial trajectories in their work. Almost always they reinvent, subvert, or hybridise both modernist and regional genres, producing deconstructive visual pro- positions that contest those orthodoxies.4 The \"institutional baggage,\" as I often refer to it, takes a long time to unpack, as students will 41testify. But we do eventually get to the internal signifying system of the work, which is where the action is, in terms of understanding how those subversive rhetorical devices function in a designated visual field. By beginning with the smallest visual or acoustic unit that can be combined with a concept in a process of signi- fication \u2014 the brushstroke in a painting, the planes of a three-dimensional object, the pixels in a digital print, a performer's single gesture, even a perishable materiality such as noise \u2014 and then proceeding to the sign, a logic emerges in the evidence of what has come before. Impasto, for example, forms an existential bond with the brushstroke, favouring the index, while the icon often demands modelling in the mode of relief, which in turn supports the narrative organisation of perspectival representation \u2014 foreground, middle ground, background, and so on \u2014 leading to a consideration of the particular combination and substitution of signs that shape the signi- fying system overall and the privileged figures of rhetoric that underwrite the proposition and, crucially, let us know when to quit. When it works, I have found this to be the most aston- ishing point in the process: there is a collective re cognition that to carry on would disrespect the artist's intention, which is, at the same time, an admission of the intensity of our various subjective investments in the outcome. Con- cluding, then, becomes an opening for the coming-into- being of the ethical observer. The trajectory of analysis that brings us to this point is entirely collaborative, and for this reason, I have been reticent to write it down as method, in any prescriptive sense that would represent it as a discourse of mastery. On the contrary, a crit(ique) session is time sensitive and unrepeatable. Ending one is always inconclu- sive, because we have aspired only to make the 2 Mary Kelly42proposition comprehensible in the present \u2014 this place, this moment in history. Nevertheless, the tactics of listening and collective enquiry we have deployed, which are also evident more widely in the present effort to decolonise our academic discourse, bear the tangible imprint of feminism's practical past. 1 See Giorgio Agamben, Means without End, trans.

I and a group of my fellow instructors established Critical & Pedagogical Studies (CPS) in 2011 to unfold what might happen when an art academy sets out to test formats across disciplines, which tend to be divided, and in vestigate the intersections between practice, pedagogy, and critical thinking within an MFA programme. Rooted in the role of the prac\u00ad titioner\u2014that is, the artist\u00ad teacher \u2014the programme produces a space for critical reflection upon the multiple positions that artists can inhabit. Before I begin describing the CPS programme in more detail, I will make a brief introduction to the structure of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. This text builds upon a presen\u00ad tation given at the symposium Front Lines, How Might We Talk about the Future? as part of \"Panel 21: Art/Education in the 21st Century,\" organised by the China Academy of Art and National Institute of Art in Beijing in March 2018.

Collective Pockets of Dialogue: Between Practice, Pedagogy, and Critical Thinking Maj Hasager20183 \"Communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly.\" \u2014Etienne and Beverly Wenger\u00adTrayner1 Maj Hasager48 When looking at contemporary art education in Sweden, we see that the traditional apprenticeship structure hardly exists any longer, and it is rather the students' practice and development that is the focal point of the teachers' activities.2 In today's art education, students are expected to be able to make use of self\u00addirected learning as a tool for development throughout their education. Self\u00addirected learning is described as a process by which individuals identify their learning needs and goals on their own initiative, with or without the assistance of others, and have the ability to evaluate the learning outcomes of a situation.3 Though experience shows that students find it difficult to enter self\u00addirected studies after attending formally structured preparatory schools, studies also show how students learn to take control of their own learning process in art academies. For example, through studio visits where they are the ones who choose which tutor to speak to and when, as described in professor Ann\u00adMari Edstr\u00f6m's 2008 study on the studio visit.4 Malm\u00f6 Art Academy has no separate departments and, in order to break down hierarchical power structures often present in art academies, no teacher, professor, or guest lecturer is allowed to enter a studio or workspace without a prior invitation from the student. Students in the BFA and MFA studio programmes organise their own curricula, choosing from a wide range of courses on topics such as art theory, artistic tech\u00ad niques, and artistic interpretation. The situation is different for the Critical & Pedagogical Studies participants, who need to adhere to a course structure with a dialogi\u00ad cally based collective setting, but the programme still attempts to be an experimental platform where the students affect and partially shape a flexible curriculum. At Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, we see strength in creating a space for a multitude of artistic practices. Each year, a different constellation of artistic practices appears, depending on the group of students accepted into our different pro\u00ad grammes. To facilitate the changing needs of the student body, we have implemented a flexible structure, which allows us to bring in exter\u00ad nal experts to match the individual students' needs as required. This is a model that works well for us across the different programmes at the Art Academy, and allows us to put our thinking into practice. That is, this set\u00adup allows us to actually test different ways of working in practice and to have the flexibility to adapt by making changes along the way. One of the core issues is trust\u2014to have trust both in the students and in the teachers\u2014which means we accept that processes take time, and 49that we underline the importance of letting a thought develop all the way to the end, no matter how long this may take. When speaking of trust, it is also important to highlight that it is the students who have the lead regarding their artistic process\u2014not the teachers. Once accepted, the students are not directed by staff and faculty; they themselves are in charge of how they structure their individualised education. Malm\u00f6 Art Academy has four different programmes and a total of seventy\u00adfive students. First, there is a Bachelor of Fine Arts studio programme, which is a three\u00adyear programme consisting of a foundation course, individual work in the studio, and individual tutoring, and which ends with a group exhibition and an essay. The second programme is the Master of Fine Arts studio programme, which is a two\u00adyear graduate programme that includes in\u00addepth research through individ\u00ad ual studio practice and self\u00adchosen courses, and ends with a solo exhibition and an essay. The third programme is the four\u00adyear PhD programme, which is an experimental and highly individualised programme that focuses on identifying, under\u00ad standing, and developing artistic thinking as a specialised field of knowledge production. The fourth programme5 is the two\u00adyear Master of Fine Arts in Critical & Pedagogical Studies, which differs in its structure and learning situation from the MFA studio programme, as I've already mentioned. CPS is an international programme that leads to an MFA degree, and it works across the borders between art theory, art practice, and pedagogy. The core of the CPS programme is structured around each iteration's small group of students; we accept up to ten individuals every other year. This allows for a dialogical learning situation where exchange and participation is essential. The programme is continuously devel\u00ad oped from semester to semester to keep the structure as open as possible (within the institutional framework) and to allow experi\u00ad mental progress to unfold through creative processes. We encourage the CPS students to take part in this ongoing development and to acknowledge the different experi\u00ad ences and knowledges present in the seminar room. This is in line with what education theorist John Dewey calls an \"experiential con\u00ad tinuum\"\u2014each experience carries the past and modifies the future, which means we also need to rely on experience when it comes to developing education.6 A main objective of the CPS programme is to create a foundation for developing communicative skills through an understanding of how to mediate and educate \u2014allowing space for on\u00adadapt ability 3 Maj Hasager50in order to push the boundaries of education and pedagogy in relation to artistic research and practice even further. The pedagogi\u00ad cal focus area is the strengthening of artistic praxis, grounded in both theory and practice. A key pedagogical component of the programme is a practical internship during the third semester. Here, the students are able to explore the notion of pedagogy as practice and the position of artist as educator or artist as mediator. This is shaped through the process of the students' own individual projects and research during the placement. The CPS students gain hands\u00adon experience of educational situations in order to test out experimental pedagogical strategies on a practical level and in a way that stems from their own individual artistic practices. These internships take on different characters depending on the variety of artistic practices of the current cohort. Projects have ranged from creating collective working models for a group of cultural producers in Portugal, to developing alternative models to the studio visit as an attempt to look at power structures. The internship has proven to be a very valuable pedagogical tool, since it allows the students to contextualise the theory in practice and to develop their vocabulary through their artistic practices. In the CPS programme, courses often take place around a table in our shared workspace, where every participant is included and asked to contribute to the conversation. Courses can also consist of move\u00ad ment sessions, such as city walks or site visits, in an attempt to break free from the learning environment of the seminar table\u2014something that has turned out to be difficult for many guest lecturers. Being placed around the table can feel like a safe zone, where one is acquainted only with the half\u00adbodies of others, each person cut in two by the seminar table or the computer screen, as the Italian critic and media activist Franco \"Bifo\" Berardi puts it. He claims that media virtualisation and the exploitation of the intellect has destroyed the empathy among bodies, the pleasure of being in contact with each other, and the pleasure of living in urban spaces. So, how do we understand the fabric of a dialogical learning situation \u2014not only by looking at the spaces where the exchange takes place but also by reflecting upon how it affects the learning? What if we dare to take a step back and observe rather than follow preconditioned ideas, and what if we\u2014in the spirit of bell hooks7\u2014recognise what we each bring to the classroom? Can we then facilitate pockets of dialogue in which learning can take place? When thinking of dialogical\u00adbased learning, we need to keep in 51mind that most educators at art academies are either artist\u00adeducators or theoretician\u00adeducators, which means the individual practice comes first and the role of the teacher second, as is pointed out in Edstr\u00f6m's research. Such educators speak from their fields of interest and personal viewpoints, which allows them to enter the dialogue without didactic methods, since most are interested in developing their fields further. There is of course a difference between traditional studio programmes, where students are left in periods of solitude, and more structured programmes, such as Critical & Pedagogical Studies, where students are expected to enter planned group situations as part of their education. Through communication between the teacher and the learner, a gap is created in which education takes place, a process described by Gert Biesta, professor of educa\u00ad tion at Brunel University London. This space for communication should be acknowledged for its uncertainties, risks, possibilities, and relations. It is in this gap, this in\u00adbetweenness, that education can take place. \"Ultimately we cannot have a theory in education,\" argues Biesta, since \"the gap in which education takes place is, after all, ultimately unrepresentable.\" How\u00ad ever, this does not mean that we can dismiss the gap due to its lack of representation, since it is only from this \"transformative\" gap that learning can take place.8 That is, only in the dialogical \"gap\" can we perform a more egalitarian communication between teacher and learner. And in acknowledging the gap, education can simultaneously exist as a discipline within the framework of the institution. Biesta also points to the am\u00ad biguity in pedagogy when it comes to art education. Students are expected to interact with openness and un certainty as part of the creative process so as to learn how to negotiate the complex and un\u00ad predictable working situation of an artist.9 How is it then possible to speak about an educational strategy within art education, if the conditions for such pedagogy are precarious? It can at times be quite challenging for the students in the CPS programme to navigate its flexible and open\u00adended curriculum, and for them to experience the two\u00adyear MFA course as a holistic endeavour. Though many have been students at an art academy before \u2014and are familiar with self\u00addirected studies\u2014it is a challenge for them to enter a group situation for two years and to have to develop new knowledge at the intersections between artistic practice, pedagogy, and critical thinking. Our intention is to form what the social\u00adlearning theorist Etienne Wenger\u00adTrayner terms a \"commu\u00ad nity of practice\" through regular group sessions, both formal and 3 Maj Hasager52informal. He defines \"communities of practice\" as \"groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they inter\u00ad act regularly.\"10 A community of practice can serve as a strong peer\u00ad to\u00adpeer foundation, which extends learning together beyond the years in the art academy to become a continuous practice. Allow me to quote a further central view of Wenger\u00adTrayner's: The school is not the privileged locus of learning. It is not a self\u00adcontained, closed world in which students acquire knowledge to be applied outside, but a part of a broader learning system. The class is not the primary learning event. It is life itself that is the main learning event. Schools, class\u00ad rooms, and training sessions still have a role to play in this vision, but they have to be in the service of the learning that happens in the world.11 I would like to apply this concept to the combination of practice, pedagogy, and critical thinking\u2014 fields that the Critical & Pedagogical Studies MFA programme was the first in Europe to integrate back in 2011. Such a combination seems to reflect the reality of many artists, who inhabit multiple positions in a practice. Yet somehow it seemed radical within the formal structures of an art academy, and perhaps it is still seen as such even today. For instance, simply mentioning the word \"pedagogy\" can still trigger some awkward responses. It is rarely described as an aspect of artistic practice and usually used only indi\u00ad rectly when discussing art education through terms like \"learning strate\u00ad gies.\" Perhaps it is because pedagogy is still so strongly associated with the traditional teacher\u00adpupil situation witnessed in classrooms all over the world that using the word in a broader sense can be seen as a challenge. One CPS student did a small survey on the topic of \"artists teaching artists\" as part of her exam project, and she found that only half of the interviewed artist\u00adeducators answered \"yes\" to the question \"Can art be taught?\" Now, this could be a consequence of the teacher\u00adpupil concept being conjured by the use of the word \"taught.\" Or perhaps it is that the saying \"Those who can't do, teach\" is somehow still stuck in the minds of some when it comes to art educa\u00ad tion. The reality, though, is quite different; perhaps one could even say, \"Those who can't do, can't teach.\" In other words, it takes a practising artist to become a teacher in an art academy. The CPS pro\u00ad gramme reflects and is informed by this reality, in line with Wenger\u00ad Trayner's view that education should be \"in the service of the learning that happens in the world.\"1253 Nevertheless, it is a common thought that teaching implies giving up one's own artistic practice, either by choice or by necessity. It has likewise been presumed that the CPS programme must consequently be producing art school teachers. And, to be clear: no\u2014we are in fact investigating multiple possible articulations in the field of art from the position of the artist. As I mentioned earlier, it is a current reality for many artists to inhabit multiple positions in their practice\u2014a reality I like to refer to as a \"hybrid practice.\" The basic definition of \"hybridity\" is a biological mixture between two species, which can be seen both on a material level as well as on a practical level. In this case, I'm applying the notion of hybridity to describe a multi\u00ad plicity embedded in a practice\u2014in this instance, an artistic practice. This also resonates with the aware\u00ad ness of hybridity as a discourse that can replace the problematic idea of multiculturalism\u2014as explicated in Homi K. Bhabha's 1994 book The Location of Culture ,13 in which he pleads for a trans national culture liberated from Western multi culturalism and the celebration of cultural diversity, which is seen as a way of recolonising the subject. Not only is hybridity a necessity for exploring multiple articulations in the field of art, but it is also often a prerequisite for making a living by means of artistic practice. In this way, holding multiple posi\u00ad tions can be seen as a way towards sustainability for the artist. However, one must also be aware of the issue of hybridity in the realm of neo\u00ad liberalism, where precarious working conditions have become the ultimate celebration of the so\u00adcalled flexible and employable citizen, which have been further promoted by the current sociopolitical conditions in Europe. The fact that having multiple positions and roles could be perceived as simply a way of conforming to the neoliberal agenda means that an in\u00addepth discussion on multiplicity in an artistic practice is needed as a critical self\u00adreflection. I argue that teaching and pedagogy can play a significant role in expanding the multiple positions that one can inhabit in an artistic practice. I would like to elaborate a bit on pedagogy as an artistic method and an artistic matter, in order to better address both its materiality and immateriality. One way of looking at pedagogy, as a method that can be interwoven with an artistic practice, is through the term \"work stories,\" which was coined by the Swedish artist and writer Magnus B\u00e4rt\u00e5s.14 He speaks about work stories as a tool for the artist in terms of self\u00adnarration. A work story is a written or oral narrative about the forming of materials, situations, 3 Maj Hasager54relations, and social practices that are, or lead to, an artwork. Work stories speak primarily about processes, and processes are on going, which means that work stories take place both in a zone of transition as well as in one of transaction. Self\u00adnarration in an artistic practice can be seen as having ties to pedagogy, as it is a form of embodied mediation. It is a process that traditionally lies outside the realm of artistic practice and thereby can function as an expansion of the artist's dialogue with an audience. B\u00e4rt\u00e5s furthermore addresses the importance of artists working and acting from their own set of premises when it comes to writing, talking, and sharing their work stories. This claiming of the space to speak for oneself as an artist can also be considered an artistic material through which processes can be revealed or hidden, depending on the chosen strategies. Though it can be an immaterial task to trace the shifts and transformations that occur in an artistic practice, one might say that mediation could be considered as a relational substance. In other words, it is a place from which the storyteller can open doors to rooms filled with speculation and anticipation, each having the potential to conceal or unravel the processes of the chosen artistic practice and material. Coming back to Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, where we aim to create space for a multiplicity of practices\u2014we set out to develop different forms of art education, one example being the Critical & Pedagogical Studies MFA pro\u00ad gramme. By establishing a space for collective exchange and dialog\u00ad ical learning situations for a small group of art students, individual and collective processes can coexist. One example of such a learning situation is the recent course \"Practise Practice\u2014Thinking through the Visual,\" led by Professor Matts Leiderstam and myself, which ran across two semesters. Here the emphasis was on artistic research seen through the students' individual practices and collective processes. The teaching method from the outset was described as flexible and in constant dialogue with the development in the group \u2014which meant fine\u00adtuning the course curriculum from session to session in response to the students' research and interests. In collabora\u00ad tion with a local art institution in Malm\u00f6, Sk\u00e5nes konstf\u00f6rening, the fifteen participants took over its exhibition space for a month as a part of the course. They negotiated the various aspects of the use of the space and worked through self\u00adorganised and collective pro\u00ad cesses, which concluded with three evenings of public events. I would like to highlight the students' statement, which greeted the visitors at the entrance to the exhibition space: 553 Dear Visitor, You are about to encounter the traces of multiple art practices developing in one space. Spatially and temporally, these practices weave in and out of the gallery and each other\u2014experimenting. In this process, countless questions have arisen, but no singular answers. Together we've wondered ... How do we make collective decisions without consensus becoming an authori\u00ad tative demand? How do we create space for the many, merging, manifold, and con\u00ad flicting among us? To what extent do we build theoretical lines within the space and among ourselves? To what extent do we allow our practices to emerge organically? We, the artists, have chosen to surrender singular authorship to explore an anonymous (or rather multi\u00ad plicitous) practice and presence in the space. One claimed by many authors, voices, and views. We've inhabited the gallery, testing ideas and pro\u00ad cesses, playing with collectivity, meeting each week for dinner, as we've worked to navigate the gallery and our practices within it. Thus, you will find practices: pieces and ideas in process, fragments of research and experiments, and temporary structures for discussion and coexistence. Samples, scores, and documents from our time and practices have accumulated in boxes we've crafted within the space. These are intended as archive and publication \u2014traces and testimonies of our thinking through the visual.15 By allowing receptiveness in the teaching situation and placing trust in the students and their processes, and understanding when to facilitate a situation and when to step back, is indeed a fine balance to keep. Likewise, we must acknowl\u00ad edge that while some students would have liked more guidance, other students would have liked the course to be even more experimental. One of the most important tools is to facilitate a space where different opinions can be heard with respect. bell hooks notes in her book Teach \u00ad ing to Transgress : \"To engage in dialogue is one of the simplest ways we can begin as teachers, scholars, and critical thinkers to cross bound\u00ad aries.\" By constantly testing out different formats, practising the act of listening, and allowing space for thought processes, we become continuous learners and hopefully create collective pockets of dialogue where exchange can take place in solidarity\u2014and also make space for multiple articulations, positions, experiences, and knowledges in the field of art.

After that, a picture was never simply a representation anymore, a material never a resource, and I likewise could not remain the same. I learned how the freedom to create requires being part of a collective, both in terms of a history to identify with and as a peer group in the present. It was at the Art Academy that I read Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own for the first time and feminism materialised as part of my body. A few years later I made a work that took Woolf's essay as its starting point which I called A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries (2006). In addition to Woolf's 1929 essay itself, A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries was made in collaboration with library readers of the essay, as well as with the many librarians working in public libraries throughout Sweden in 2005 and 2006. The work is a republication of the Swedish translation of Woolf's essay \u2014 Ett eget rum \u2014 that compiles every marginal note made in library copies from all over the country. A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries assembles almost fifty years of handwritten annotations made between the 1958 publication of the first Swedish translation and 2006, when the work was completed. It was published in an edition of one thousand. The following pages contain a few of its spreads, alongside some commentary from me.A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries Kajsa Dahlberg 2006/20204 is the tree that overshadows64 654 65 Kajsa DahlbergNote: (1929 - 2006) 66Note: (1929 - 2006) 2006) 73 DahlbergNote: -) 74Note: (2020 -) 75 Kajsa DahlbergNote: (1929) Woolf's A Room of One's Own consists of two lectures on the subject of women and fiction given at the women's colleges of the University of Cambridge in 1928 and published in 1929. With the help of her narrator, Mary Beton, Woolf approaches her topic of \"women and fiction\" through a combination of research, anecdotes, imagined histories, and fictionalised encounters. She invites the reader to join her in the analysis of what is clearly a topic that is impossible to sum up. Reading A Room of One's Own articulates structures that often remain invisible. Woolf demonstrates how the freedom to write depends upon material things such as \"health and money and the houses we live in\"\u2014all the many and often small ways in which creativity requires support: institutional, financial, and intellectual. The imaginary work of fiction, following Woolf, attaches itself to all corners of life like a spider's web. But \"these webs are not spun in mid-air by incorporeal creatures. They are the work of suffering human beings and attached to grossly material things.\" 1 For Woolf, having \"a room of one's own\" is a way to concretise the freedom to be creative, characterised by the necessity of having enough money and a space in which to do that work. 76Note: (2005 - 06) Some of the library books I came across in my work had very few underlinings and scribbled words \u2014 subtle addendums that became somewhat masked by the multiplicity of voices in the final version. In one copy, belonging to the Ume\u00e5 public library, someone had circled the word \"anger,\" as it recurs in Woolf's essay at least forty times \u2014 and some sixteen times over the course of only a few pages. This is in the second chapter, when Woolf's narrator, in her pursuit of truth, visits the British Museum to find an answer to the question, \"Why are some women poor?\" Here, she un ravels a \"world\" of literature in which the concept of \"human\" is equated with \"man\" and \"gender\" is understood only as \"woman.\" In her notebook, Mary Beton compiles the following list: Condition in Middle Ages of, Habits in the Fiji Islands of, Worshipped as goddesses by, Weaker in moral sense than, Idealism of, Greater conscientiousness of, South Sea Islanders, age of puberty among, Attractiveness of, Offered as sacrifice to, Small size of brain of, Profounder sub-consciousness of, Less hair on the body of, Mental, moral and physical inferiority of, Love of children of, Greater length of life of, Weaker muscles of, Strength of affections of, Vanity of,77 MATTS LEIDERSTAMHigher education of, Shakespeare's opinion of, Lord Birkenhead's opinion of, Dean Inge's opinion of, La Bruyere's opinion of, Dr Johnson's opinion of, Mr Oscar Browning's opinion of ... Here our narrator draws her breath, then writes in the margin: \"Why does Samuel Butler say, 'Wise men never say what they think of women'? ... Wise men never say anything else apparently.\" The authors on her list are \"professors, schoolmasters, sociolo- gists, clergymen, novelists, essayists, journalists, men who no quali- fication save that they were not women.\" These men seem to control everything except the fog, Mary concludes, and yet they seem angry with women as the rich are with the poor. Terrified by the results of her research, she does what Woolf would not: doodles cartwheels and circles on the slips of paper pro vided by the British taxpayer for other purposes. Note: The \"I\" that is the tree that overshadows While Woolf's narrator recognises that the presumed male \"I\" of literature is oftentimes respectable, honest, and logical \u2014 \"as hard as a nut, and polished for centuries by good teaching and good feeding\" \u2014 its shadow is all too often \"shapeless as a mist.\" \"Is that a tree? No, it is a woman.\" The \"I\" of Woolf's essay is otherwise. It is mainly narrated by Mary Beton, who received her fortune (\u00a3500 a year) from a woman (her aunt) who also shares her name. The one is two, standing in for the indefinite: \"Call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please \u2014 it is not a matter of any importance.\" 774 Kajsa Dahlberg78Note: (1929 - 2006) Through its materiality, my work A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries aspires to ask questions such as: What is a literary text edition? To whom does it belong? Who does it speak to, and who is allowed to speak? It does so alongside the questions posed by Woolf's essay, among them: \"Why are some women poor?\" \"What effect has poverty on fiction?\" \"What conditions are necessary for the creation of works of art?\" \"Why are women [judging from the history of literature] so much more interesting to men than men are to women?\" \"Women \u2014 but are you not sick to death of the word?\"Note: (1858 -) In the second chapter, Mary acknowledges the compromised foundations of her own liberation. Despite having her \"five hundred a year and a room with a lock on the door,\" she is herself not free from the spider's web of material connection. She owes her inheritance to imperialism, as her aunt (the one with the same name) fell off a horse and died \"when she was riding out to take the air in Bombay.\" Under patriarchal rule, Mary seems to think, money is a better alternative to democracy.79 \"'Chloe liked Olivia'\" ... \"although one of them was married and had [...] two small children.\" \"For if Chloe likes Olivia and Mary Carmichael knows how to express it she will light a torch in that vast chamber where nobody has yet been.\"Note: (2003) In the book Death of a Discipline, literary theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak invokes A Room of One's Own to put forward urgent questions to the future of \"comparative literature\" as a discipline: \"Can democracy \u2014 invariably claimed as a politics, or perhaps the politics of friendship \u2014 function without a logofratrocentric [a logic centred in masculinity or masculine exchange] notion of collectivity? With the sister allowed in rarely, and only as an honorary brother?\"2 In addition to Woolf's essay itself being based on two lectures, she frames her fictional anecdotes within the setting of the lecture hall. But the lecture as lecture does not begin. \"I would write this sentence,\" is where Mary Beton ends the final chapter. She would say that \"it is fatal for anyone who writes to think of their sex. It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly.\" She would say it if she could, but she can't, in the time of the book. For Woolf, fiction becomes the way to reimagine the figure of the woman as something other than a figuration of the impossible. What happens when the woman is no longer an honorary brother? Kajsa Dahlberg80Note: (- 2006) In A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries, readers bring their personal reactions and shared experiences in ways that contribute to the text's (hi)story through making the text into many texts. Just as Woolf's text is also already many: it is an amalgamation of four essays that resulted in two lectures and told through a narrator and an \"I\" that is many. \"Call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton, Mary Carmichael or by any name you please \u2014 it is not a matter of any importance.\" Woolf might appear to be alone in much of the book, but she is in fact surrounded. As we follow the narrator(s) through the essay, we meet women from history, both those who made it as writers in real life and those who have to be imagined. We are surrounded by the women students in the lecture hall in which Woolf frames her fictional anecdotes. As readers, we take part in this collective, and A Room of One's Own, as it turns out, comes to be an essay about women's collectivity. One's own room becomes a shared space.Note: (1564 - 1616) As a figure of the unfulfilled creativity of women, Woolf creates a character named Judith Shakespeare \u2014 an imaginary sister of William Shakespeare. Judith was just as talented as her brother, with \"the tune of words\" and \"a taste for the theatre.\" But because she was a woman, her talent was neither recognised nor permitted to flourish. Woolf's tale of being a women and a writer in the six- teenth century is a one in which such a life is \"completely and entirely\" impossible or destroyed, with Judith Shakespeare's suicide being the tragicomic conclusion, \"buried at some cross-roads where the omnibuses now stop outside the Elephant and Castle.\" 8081Note: (2020-) In the book's conclusion, Woolf seems to give up the privilege of the \"room of one's own and \u00a3500 a year.\" Here she exhorts the reader to work for the future of women writers and to make possible the realisation of a Judith Shakespeare. As she tells us in the very last line: \"I maintain that she would come if we worked for her, and that so to work, even in poverty and obscurity, is worthwhile.\" On the opposite page of A Room of One's Own / A Thousand Libraries a reader enthusiastically notes: \"\u2014 Out of the commons!\"Note: One of the most underlined sentences of the book reads: \"For master-pieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.\" 1 Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own, 1929 (Project Gutenberg ebook, last updated April 2020), http://gutenberg. net.au/ebooks02/0200791.txt.

Two are sketched below, followed by four truncated entries for future elaboration: \"The Disputation at Lund, 15 / 09 / 06,\" Lab,\" \" Uddevalla, Volvo, 1989 - 93,\" and \"Nameless Science or the Unnameable?\" Mulling Over Method (1) The query that crops up right away with the idea of \"visual art as knowledge production\" is: What sort of knowledge? Hard on its heels: What marks out its difference, its otherness? Should we not rather speak of non\u00adknowledge \u2014activity that is neither hard\u00adnosed know\u00adhow nor its ostensible opposite, igno\u00ad rance? The question is especially pertinent in today's expanding knowledge economy that we should not only see as a \"technological development\" but as an emerging overall condition of living that I prefer to speak of as the \"grey\u00ad matter\" environs. (2) \"Visual Art as Knowledge Production\" involves sundry epistemic engines and contraptions that we might broadly refer to as \"Thinking Through the Visual.\" What do such modes of knowing entail? How do they tick? With (1) above, we can get bogged down fairly quickly with the daunting notion that nothing counts unless it has the systematic This is an amended version of a text that was first published in Malm\u00f6 Art Academy Yearbook 2007 - 2008 and in Geist 11, 12 and 14 (Stockholm, 2007 - 2008). Republished by permission of the author. Know-How and No-How: Stopgap Notes on \"Method\" in Visual Art as Knowledge Production Sarat Maharaj20085 Sarat Maharaj84rigour of \"science.\" This might be an unavoidable, bracing test\u00ad demand of today's knowledge scene. How\u00ad ever, it should not blind us to the fact that what we lump together as \"science\" is often a congeries of quite divergent activities, disciplines, and domains, each with its own kit of objectives and logical procedures. We should be wary of treating them as if they added up to a monstrous monolith. In any event, many scien\u00ad tists themselves remain more than a pinch circumspect of philosophical attempts to sum up their activities with a single overarching method\u00ad ological principle. We might do better to keep matters open, perhaps with a feel for the hodgepodge of methods, even muddle, that attends the lab workbench. Though Gaston Bachelard's musings might in parts sound a touch dated, his view of \"science\" as a plurality of practices in which \"each secretes its own epistemology\"\u2014each, arguably, with its own \"degree of approximation to truth\"\u2014serves as an antidote to a solo, make or break, subsuming principle of knowledge, truth, and method ( Le Nouvel esprit scienti \u00ad fique , 1934). His account resonates with the state of play in art practice and research that also amounts to a proliferation of self\u00adshaping probes, stand\u00adalone enquiries, motley see\u00adthink\u00adknow modes. Their sheer spill tends to stump and stonewall generalisable principles\u2014at any rate, they resist being wholly taken under the wing of systematic methodological explication. Two examples flesh out the point: Marcel Duchamp spent years devising a lingo, with rules, anti\u00adrules, and measures, mingled in with doses of quirk, chance, and random intrusion for his Large Glass project (1915-21). Sometimes they appear to strive towards formulation as abstract principles of method \u2014as \"algebraic expression\" in his phrase\u2014that can be applied at large. At other moments they hunker down to one\u00adoff use\u2014with relevance only to a particular, unique, intensive instance. There is a billowing out towards the global scope of \"method proper\" countered by retraction to the modestly local, here and now. Duchamp damped down wider claims for his methods by noting that they were \"probably only applicable to individual works\" such as his own Large Glass . With The Passage from Virgin to Bride , we feel a process of becoming \u2014emergence from brooding states of possibility\u2014towards a kit of disposable rules of engagement that seem poised to dissolve back into a pervasive, unpredictable, creative muddle. In contrast to Duchamp's conceptual domain, the second example is from the retinal field: David Hockney's look at regimes of seeing, Secret Knowledge (1990) \u2014a project that might be seen as \"art research\" avant la lettre . He rubs up his examination of retinal\u00adoptical schemas and their 85underlying structural principles against his keen observations of how they are often modified and moulded by the artist's eccentric eye or touch. We glean that the drive to render, regulate, and represent perceptual experience on the back of method\u00ad ological formulae is constantly amended by the artist's handling, by embodied knowledge. What comes into spotlight with these two somewhat iconic examples\u2014the sample could be expanded to take in Mario Navarro, Seydou Boro, Tamar Guimar\u00e3es, Thomas Hirschhorn, Lu Jie, Huang Xiaopeng, amongst others\u2014is the point that method is perhaps less about given, handed\u00addown procedures than about approaches that have to be thrashed out, forged again and again on the spot, impromptu in the course of the art practice\u00adresearch effort. I am left pondering the idea that method is not so much ready\u00admade and received as \"knocked together for the nonce\"\u2014something that has to be invented each time with each research endeavour. Any Space Whatever With the above we have what looks like a roller coaster between the methodological pole of \"universal application\" and that of the rule of thumb restricted to the \"particular.\" How to portray something of this oscillation in theoretical terms? Deleuze came to explore the sense of an unfolding flux between the \"poles\" in all its phases and vari ability through the notion of \"any space whatever\"\u2014drawing on a series of examples from film (GD, Cinema 1 and 2 ). In his critique, \"any space whatever\" takes on the force of method: it embodies the concept of \"singularity\" that cuts across the poles of the universal and the particular dissolving them. A strand in the backstory of this notion, as we might deduce from his reference to Bachelard, seems to lie with Ferdinand Gonseth who had tussled with the \"any space whatever\" in mathematics, with rules that undergo change, with process and contingency. In the framework of a non\u00adAristotelian logic, Bachelard had used the term for an alternative tack to the Kantian principle of the \"universal\"\u2014also, to bridge the gap between thinking either in a priori or a posteriori terms, in empirical or in rationalist key (GB. \"La philosophie du non,\" 1940). For our purposes, it is Giorgio Agamben's \"whatever\" that will have to do as a more digestible, more spelled\u00adout version of a methodological alternative to the \"universal/particular\" polarity\u2014to what can be slotted neither into the category of the \"individual\" nor into the \"generic\" without grievous distortion. He broaches it as modal oscillation illustrated by the example of the human face. Its constantly changing liveliness, its vivacity, he notes, embodies a singularity that 5 Sarat Maharaj86is neither an individual manifesta\u00ad a \"general pre\u00adexisting facial template\" nor a \"universalisation\" of the unique traits of one specific face. Perhaps not unlike an ever morphing ripple between the extremes of \"all faces in a crowd\" and \"just this one\" in front of us? He goes on: In the line of writing the ductus of the hand passes continually from the common form of the letters to the particular marks that identify its singular pres\u00ad ence, and no one, even using the scrupulous rigour of graphology, could ever trace the real division between these two spheres. So too in a face, human nature continually passes into existence and it is precisely this incessant emergence that constitutes its expressivity. But would it be equally plausible to say the opposite: It is from the hundred idiosyncrasies that characterize my way of writing the letter p or of pronouncing its phoneme that its common form is en\u00ad gendered. Common and proper, genus and individual are only the two slopes dropping down from either side of the watershed of whatever. (GA, The Coming Community , 1993) His sum up can sound a trifle pat, even reductive. He evokes something elusive graphically only to nail it down all too firmly as a principle. Deleuze, on the other hand, teases out, frame by frame, the diverse ways in which \"whatever singu\u00ad larity\" comes to be embodied in specific scenes\u2014a diverse sequence of examples that cannot be fixed into a rule that has \"universal\" coverage. Agamben highlights the tricky method ological poser we cannot easily shake off\u2014that by opting to treat art practice and research either entirely under the universal or the particular, either exclusively on the immanent or transcendental plane, we miss out on reckoning with its intrinsic condition, its \"singularity.\" With (2) above, we have to clock both senses of the phrase \"Thinking Through the Visual\" in order to latch onto its import for method. It is not only about thinking by means of the visual, via its sticky thick, as it were. It is about unpack\u00ad ing it, taking apart its components, scouring its operations. A point that crops up at this juncture is what makes the texture of visual art thinking quite its own, its difference? What is its distinctive thrust in con\u00ad trast to other disciplines at the more academic end of the spectrum\u2014to forms of enquiry tied up with, say, mainstream anthropology, sociology, literary, and communication studies or historiography? Does it spawn \"other\" kinds of knowledge they cannot\u2014what I've elsewhere called \"xeno\u00adepistemics\"? How to sound this obscure surge without treating it as an \"unchanging essence of art practice\"? What I am trying to 87finger eventuates not so much in the well\u00adtrodden terrain of the academic disciplines or in the so\u00adcalled gaps, chinks, and cracks between them or in any designated \"interdisciplinary\u00ad transdisciplinary\" belt. Rather it is a force in its own right, always incipient in \"whatever\" spaces\u2014 windswept, derelict brownfields and wastelands\u2014where intimations of unknown elements, thinking probes, spasms of non\u00adknowledge emerge and come into play. It is distinct from the circuits of know\u00adhow that run on clearly spelled\u00adout method\u00ad ological steel tracks. It is rather the unpredictable surge and ebb of potentialities and propensities\u2014the flux of no\u00adhow . The term is Samuel Beckett's although I intend it here without that shot of bleakness with which he normally imbues it. \"No\u00adhow\" embodies indeterminacy, inspissates \"An Unknown Object in 4D: Scenes of Art Research,\" 2003). This is not to say that visual art practices do not interact with established discursive\u00adacademic circuits and think\u00adknow components. They do so vigorously\u2014glossing and translating them, aping them with bouts of piss\u00adtake, subjecting them to d\u00e9tournement . However, this should not lull us into seeing the discursive as the only or the prime modality of \"Thinking Through the Visual.\" Alongside, runs its intensive non\u00addiscursive register, its seething para\u00addiscursive charge and capability\u2014both its \"pathic\" and \"phatic\" force, its penumbra of the its somatic scope, its smoky atmos\u00ad pherics, its performative range. For method, the job is to draw a vital distinction between \"thinking through the visual\" and the somewhat crimped mode of \"visual thinking.\" By the latter, I mean those approaches to the visual that treat it predominantly as an \"image\u00adlingo\"\u2014basing it on a linguistic model ostensibly with codes of grammar, syntax, and related regularities. The rise of this view accompanies strands of Conceptual Art\u2014also, the poststructuralist\u00ad semiological dis\u00ad pensation where \"reading and the is styled as an almost full\u00adblown linguistic and \"literacy\" enterprise. Its impact is to restrict the visual to verbal\u00addiscursive legi\u00ad bility\u2014a linguistic turn and dexterity exem plified by Jacques Lacan's pronouncement that \"the uncon\u00ad scious is structured like a language.\" In this perspective, \"talking over the visual\"\u2014in the sense of mulling it over\u2014literally turns into \"talking over and above it.\" odds with about what we may dub the \"agglutinative mode\": (i) To speak of it both as \"liquid, wordless syntax\" and as the \"grammarless zone\" Sarat Maharaj88possibility sounds a bit double\u00ad tongued. But the mode is shot through with contraries. Its principal thrust is decisively beyond the organising, classifying spirit of grammar, beyond the divisions and discontinuities associated with the way regular lingo cuts up and shapes thought and expression. Henri Bergson saw such categories\u2014verbs, substantives, adverbs\u2014as brittle, arbitrary functions of the intel\u00ad lect\u00adanalytic. They rendered the ever changing flow of time, expe\u00ad rience, and consciousness in terms of static representations, stills, and freeze shots. He likened this to the \"cinematographical mechanisms of thought\"\u2014to cut\u00adand\u00adpaste tech\u00ad niques that conjured up the illusion of movement instead of immersing us in duration, flow, and change\u2014in the \"streamsbecoming.\" Duchamp and Deleuze sought to articulate such passages of transition and transformation\u2014precisely by a \"turned around\" use of film stuff that had \"Fatal Natalities,\" 1997). and splice, non\u00ad inflexional modes of elision and stickiness. We have a dramatic contrast by setting it off against parsing\u2014a function that epitomises the \"slice and carve\" mechanism of grammar. It is about chopping up flows of information, experience, and thought into combinatory bits, modules, units, and packets to configure them into algorithmic sequences\u2014into the computational mode. It stands at the opposite end of the spectrum to the agglutinative's \"stick on\" processes of figuring forth, of constellating assemblages. Whether this puts it entirely outside the ambit of grammar remains arguable. More likely we are faced with an agrammaticality that has the capacity to oscillate rapidly between several modalities. In this sense, it is at odds with the computational constancy and equilibrium of know\u00adhow and closer to the all\u00adover smears, surges, and spasms, the un\u00ad predictable swell and dip of no\u00adhow . The Wiring Diagram: 01/10/1974 John Hoskyns spent ages perfecting his diagram of factors and pro\u00ad tagonists in the sorry saga of the mid\u00ad1970s British economy (JH, Just in Time , 2007) an arresting piece of visual thinking, it reminded Mrs. Thatcher of a \"chemical plant.\" At first sight, it seems a jumble of pathways, routes, cul\u00adde\u00adsacs. But as we pore over the carefully plotted circuits and linkages, we become aware of the array of social forces and institutional relations teetering on the brink. In the larger sweep of historical events, it is perhaps a miniscule, if sparking, footnote to Mrs. T.'s tough remedy for the \"sick man of Europe\"\u2014a cure that involved \"rolling back state bureau\u00ad cracy,\" halting creeping socialist control, and a \"long march\" to 89the free\u00admarket economy. Systems theory, cause and effect relations, feedback loops shape Hoskyns's visual exposition. The various positions have a sense of reversibil\u00ad ity, an air of linear\u00adcausal rationale. The impression we have is of a set of relations that can be rerun with much the same result each time\u2014or with little leeway for difference of outcome, for detour and digres\u00ad sion. It lends a stamp of reliability, consistency, and coherence as would be expected of a considered socio\u00ad economic statement. This is at odds with how we might under\u00ad stand repetition in art practice and research where such a degree of \"exact repeatability\" would be looked upon not only as unlikely but undesirable, where each rerun would spawn unique, one\u00adoff variants\u2014 where repetition amounts to unpre\u00ad dictable generation of divergence and difference. (ii) Whether we take the Ezra Pound-Marshall McLuhan exchange on the copula of dialec\u00ad tical thinking pitted against agglu\u00ad tination (EP/McL, The Interior Landscape , 1969), or James Joyce's sticky lingo in Finnegans Wake or Derrida's reading of Jean Genet against Hegel (JD, Glas , 1989), or The Wiring Diagram. John Hoskyns. October 1, 1974, in Just in Time. Inside the Thatcher Revolution. Aurum Press, 20005 Sarat Maharaj 90Michel Foucault's unpacking of the \"Western episteme\"\u2014we have probes galore looking for an escape hatch from the closures of dialectical thinking in which Hegel is usually billed as the bugbear. The point here is whether the agglutinative offers a less overbearing logical structure and is less of a \"no\u00adexit\" contrap\u00ad tion than its dialectical counterpart. The complaint against the latter is that from its opening gambit, its proposition already contains the outcome\u2014\"foreclosing\" engagement with radical difference. It leaves no room for the \"other\" to put in an appearance in his or her own terms. We are presented with a thesis which already prefigures and tailors the antithesis of the \"other\"\u2014groomed for \"cancellation and carry over,\" for \"Aufhebung \" onto a \"higher\" plane. From the word go, the \"self\" who makes the proposition calls the tune in constructing the \"other\"\u2014a view of dialectical procedure that comes in for heightened criticism under post\u00adMarxist, postcolonial eyes to\u00ad day. Deleuze relates the agglutinative loose, open\u00adended logical struc\u00ad ture\u00adin\u00adprogress. Its com ponents are linked together by no more than a lick of glue\u2014threaded together with no more than the humble The Disputation at Lund. September 15, 2006. Drawing by Cedric Bomford 91conjunctive form \"and+ and+ and+ ...\" Elements join up in an add on ad infinitum scenario at odds with the assimilative force unleashed by dialectical relations. The sort of non\u00adassimilative threading is not unlike a \"list that can be added onto interminably\" that is Feyerabend's riposte to the streak of control freak\u00ad ery in dialectical thinking. It is not surprising that he and Deleuze cite Kurt Schwitters's Merz assemblages as models of non\u00addialectical method, seeing in his art practice a kind of Dada epistemics\u2014a shuttle between Muddle\u00adMethod\u00adMadness\u2014an opening to otherness and difference that cannot be known in advance (SM, \"Monkeydoodle,\" 1997, and \"Merz\u00adThinking: 50 years of documenta,\" 2006). Method Fever The preceding issues of method are largely in a theoretical vein. Below are notes on (i) and (ii) institutional (iii) economic (iv) historical factors that have a bearing on the story. (i) The Disputation at Lund, 15/09/06 The first PhDs in visual arts practice \"under Bologna\" were assessed (Lund Stadshal & Konsthal. 2005) by an international panel of examiners chaired by Gertrud Sandqvist and H\u00e5kan Lundstr\u00f6m, Malmo Art Academy, Lund by Sopawan Boonimitra, Matts Leiderstam, and Miya Yoshida. The event marked a substantial advance in formal visual art education. Not least, it signals the growing institutional location of visual art practice and research in the university sphere. In the UK, where these develop\u00ad ments are further down the road, we see the emergence of a full\u00adblown art practice-research system with a corpus of methods and proce\u00ad dures\u2014identifiable, validated, and testable; that is increasingly the sine qua non. The Research Assessment Exercise (RAE), the meta\u00ad review of research criteria ( Roberts Report ), journals, publications, and confer\u00ad ences further attest to investments in art method as an \"emerging arena of practice and research\" and its \"academic legitimating.\" A com\u00ad prehensive midway reflection on these develop ments (\"History of the Human Sciences: Knowledge for What?,\" 1999) concluded that some tendencies have proved positive and fruitful, others remain cause for concern\u2014above all, the prospect of an administered, highly managed \"ideology of creativity.\" The pletho\u00ad ra of \"Departments of Creativity and Innovation\"\u2014especially at the intersection of New Media, Art, Design, and Science\u2014signal both contemporary anxieties over \"creativity\" and new mappings of the terrain. It also heralds the phenomenon of the \"methodolog\u00ad isation process\" generally under\u00ad stood in somewhat instrumental fashion as a kit of know\u00adhow 5 Sarat Maharaj92procedures and techniques. The frenzy over method is perhaps not dissimilar to the moment in the \"onwards march of method\" in philosophy of science in the heyday of Karl Popper. It provoked Feyerabend's \"Anti\u00ad Method\" \u2014a call to resist \"methodologisa\u00ad tion\" by taking heart from both an original scepticism and \"creative muddle\" that attends scientific experiment and art practice. The call resonates with an earlier moment in the history of the English art school when it was to some extent regarded a site of \"unschoolability\"\u2014where one stumbled over unknown possibilities, over \"no\u00adhow,\" rather than trained in the know\u00adhow of a practitioner \"in the method school of acting\" (SM, \"Vienna,\" 2001). (ii) Confucius Lab Why knowledge \"production\"? The question crops up again as we see \"method fever\" intensifying the drive towards institutionalisation of art research and practice: with this goes a heightened academicisa\u00ad tion not in the sense of enhanced analytical rigour but of regulation and routine. Why speak of \"pro\u00ad duction\" when it smacks of facto\u00ad ries, surpassed industrial modes, heavy\u00admetal sites and plants, the assembly line's mechanical regime \u2014standardising components at odds with the vagaries of art practice? The usage is to help distinguish it sharply from the domain of Bo Shi Hall. Sarat Maharaj. Beijing, 2008 \"knowledge transfer.\" The latter chugs on primarily with acts of transmission. It is about shifting already made bodies of thought and data, about handling and filtering existing information. The emphasis is on both reproducing data and passing it on, a DNA Xerox process\u2014the logic of replication. 93 \"Production,\" on the other hand, centres on a transformative crossover that throws up a surplus, that churns out something more than what was there to begin with. In this sense, it harbours the possi\u00ad bility of spawning something \"other\" than what already exists\u2014the logic of invention and innovation. It is about generating data, new objects and ways of knowing. \"Transfer\" presides over a defined territory, ultimately the canonical corpus. The concern is with mastering and min\u00ad ing an already identified field with fixed procedures and protocol, with formal induction and training. The epitome of this drive is perhaps the antique \"closed circuit\" of the Confucius exam system. Its function was to ensure replication of schol\u00ad arly knowledge and bureaucratic know\u00adhow\u2014the maintenance of a sense of stasis, of perpetual equilibri\u00ad um. It marks a scene of learning that essentially unfolds within a frame of rules to ensure carry over and conti\u00ad nuity. In contrast, with \"production\" there is leeway to this regulative force, the possibility of divagation, of divergence and disequilibrium over a period of time that makes vital room for the appearance of something different or unforeseen. In this sense, the scene of learning becomes like a \"lab without protocol\". The lab has featured widely in recent years as a model for what the contemporary Art Academy might look like. The idea gained further currency with the Laboratorium exhibition (Provinciaal Fotografie Museum, Antwerp, 1999) that implicitly probed and unpacked traditional models of the Academy \u2014Studio and Atelier. The \"Lab\" model gave impetus to mapping new, emerging relations between work, labour, creativity, and scientific\u00ad technological practices\u2014interactions increasingly shaping the structures of contemporary production and living. It tended to show up the Academy\" more as a \"self\u00adorganis\u00ad ing space\" than as the transmission belt of \"knowledge transfer\" based on the authority of the master practi\u00ad tioner. This tilt becomes pronounced with \"outsourcing\"\u2014practitioners plugging into high\u00adtech know\u00adhow beyond the Academy walls for the construction and execution of their work. It put into question the Lab model itself\u2014the older view of the Academy as the self\u00adsufficient Panepistemion. Today, the \"Acad\u00ad emy\" is seen not as the fixed site, Know\u00adAll Centre but as a straggle of self\u00adorganising educative\u00ad creative events and conjunctures, each springing up afresh from scratch, as it were, for whatever art research project. The Academy becomes less a monolith establishment, more a series of micro\u00adlabs or nano\u00adlabs, that take shape within a band of knowledge practices\u2014within the modalities of the haptic, retinal, computational, the frequencies of sonic grime, the somatic, perform\u00ad ative, digital, amongst others. Each 5 Sarat Maharaj94time an art or research programme is floated, we might say, a micro\u00adlab has to be knocked together for the occasion. Like kludges or Heath Robinson contraptions, they have to be patched together for the occasion with whatever is at hand\u2014what we might call \"a lab for the nonce\". (iii) Uddevalla, Volvo, 1989 - 93 As the \"conditions of creativity\" undergo change today, they have increasing bearing on what we consider as \"work\"\u2014how we define labour, knowledge, creativity, and art practice. Method and technique feature heavily in this shifting scene. The Volvo factory at Uddevalla, Sweden, was tailor\u00admade for one of the most advanced experiments in work, method, and creativity in terms of the post\u00adFord model of production. The deep distinctions in older industrial production between workforce and planners, brawn and brain, makers and thinkers came in for remapping at Uddevalla and its counterparts in other parts of the advanced capitalist world\u2014a devel\u00ad opment coinciding with the sine qua non of information technology. Sta\u00ad tioned in special work bays, workers were equipped to plan and direct the whole project, with emphasis on feeding new ideas into production \u2014tapping into the workers' \"creativity and imagination.\" From the image of the worker as an alienated, automaton\u00ad operative we move to that of the knowl\u00ad edge\u00adconcept engineer, whose store of brainwork, inventive and creative capacities becomes the linchpin of production in the \"immaterial labour\" of the knowledge economy. We might see a rough but suggestive parallel between this development and the notion Duchamp had toyed with\u2014the idea of a \"grey matter, cortex\u00adbased\" art. He conceived of this partly to weed out the some\u00ad what lowly \"physical\" status of art knowledge and creativity encapsu\u00ad lated in the phrase \"as stupid as a painter.\" What would be the shape of an intelligent\u00adconceptual\u00adcortical art practice remains an open issue in contemporary art. However, there is not a little irony in the fact that the \"work\u00adcreativity embrace\" in today's \"grey matter\" environs is not dissimilar to what he seems to have had in mind. It marks a further step down the road of what we might call the \"corticalisation of creativity\"\u2014tending towards the pole of dexterous, \"ether\u00adreal\" permutations in the algorithmic mode. The ten dency marks the rendering of creativity increasingly as hard\u00adnosed know\u00adhow \u2014a drift that makes it even more crucial to keep the door open for the unpre\u00ad dictable see\u00adfeel\u00adthink processes of no\u00adhow . (iv) Nameless Science or the Unnameable? When I mentioned Agamben's account of Aby Warburg's \"Nameless Science\" almost in the same breath as Samuel Beckett's 95Unnamable (SM, \"An Unknown Object in 4D,\" 2003), my aim was to highlight a factor that has come to loom large today\u2014the tendency towards the institutional captivity of art research, the academicisation of \"thinking through the visual.\" I tend to see this as an intrinsic effect of philosophical explication on experimental\u00adembodied practices such as Warburg's\u2014that it renders what we call the \"Nameless Science\" in danger of being named explicitly and being tagged with an all too determinate identity, perhaps no more than a step away from setting it up as a recognisable, academic terrain with disciplinary borders. This has little to do with Agamben's analysis as such\u2014which happens to be a nuanced, suggestive piece\u2014but the drive in theoretical exposition to \"rationale\" behind Warburg's \"chaotic, im\u00ad promptu think\u00adfeel\u00adknow sorties,\" to out in a clear\u00adcut way as a methodological kit. The threat of codifying his approach has shad\u00ad owed his work all along from the time the Warburg Library\u00adin\u00adExile of the 1930s underwent incorporation by the late 1940s into an \"institute\" 5 Sarat MaharajKnow How, No How & Knack. Sarat Maharaj, 2008 96of the University of London. The demand to nail the unnameable covers several dimensions of his work: the pressure to identify the logic behind \"thinking through the visual,\" behind elements of \"xeno\u00adepistemics\" in his yearning to reconnect with the \"other worlds\" of the Pueblo and Hopi, behind the Dada epistemics of his \"critique of un reason\" of his Bildatlas . The demand to iron these out tended to be in the interests of placing the \"Nameless Science\" in the order of university disciplines, in the formation of the History of Art as a proper field of study with know\u00adhow credentials. His apparently topsy\u00adturvy think\u00adfeel\u00ad know contraptions perhaps truly took refuge with artists\u2014with practices such as Kitaj and Eduardo Paolozzi in their disjunctive collage modes (R.B. Kitaj, Pictures with Commentary, Pictures without Commentary , 1963). These seemed to spring at the outskirts of regu\u00ad lated readings of Warburg's visual in vestigations. At odds with the \"institutional drive\"\u2014one that can easily repeat itself in the art research world after the \"Disputation at Lund\"\u2014we have Samuel Beckett's Unnameable , crucially no\u00adhow . 97 Sarat Maharaj Ronald B.

Its point of departure is a short novel by the German astron- omer Johannes Kepler.1 Although framed as a dream, this tale of a lunar voyage was devised to validate the radically seditious thesis of a heliocentric universe.2 For over thirty years, Kepler worked on his contentious theory, writing in Latin rather than the more accessible vernacular in the hope of warding off attacks from those who still believed that the earth was located at the centre of the universe.

Soon gaining an underground repu- tation among devotees of science fiction, today it is widely recognised as a pioneer in that genre. While writers such as J.G. Ballard have drawn profitably from it, filmmakers have not yet succeeded in giving it cinematic form. Extensive research into Somnium's checkered history informed Barba's eponymous project. Borrowing Kepler's title in tribute, she has drawn upon both his tale and, equally importantly, his remark- able achievement in establishing a new ontology of vision. One of the singular features of Kepler's novella is its curious structure. The story, such as it is, breaks off abruptly when the narrator suddenly wakens from his lunar voyage and finds himself in his bed, his head muffled under his pillow. Recourse to the device of a dream is a blatant ruse that does little to mask the incendiary argument, the substance of which may be found in the extensive footnotes and commentaries that threaten to over - whelm the brief tale. Filled with scientific data and hypotheses, these appendices sometimes ground, and sometimes contest, the empirical observations and classical references proffered in the main body of the text. At the heart of Kepler's thesis is the conviction that rational scientific hypotheses can lead to theoretical truths neither accessible to, nor necessarily verifiable by, pragmatic observational study. Prescient recognition of the limitations of direct observation and empirical enquiry led him to posit an ontology of vision based in scientific theory. A debate couched in similar terms is woven into Barba's work. Her film opens with the voice-over of an authoritative male speaker who dispassionately relays the informa- tion that, though the planet Somnium is currently devoid of all living forms, nature is in the process of reclaiming areas that until recently had been given over to human enterprises. A classic science fiction beginning, this opening gambit promises the security of a grand narrative yet quickly destabilises expectation by introducing a variety of narrative modes that undermine notions of authorial omnipotence and co herence. Suturing documentary material to fictional narrative, and interleaving dissenting eye witness accounts with the reports of officialdom, she counterpoints the evi dentiary with the theoretical. A second voice is then heard. Colloquial in tone as well as address, it rarely rises above a fearful whisper as it relays its suspicions that something is deeply wrong with the information being distributed publicly about the sweeping changes transforming the environment. Unlike Kepler's knowing narrator, Barba's unassuming if sceptical witness seems unaware of the polemical import of his observations. Ultimately, the artist's film avoids 101adjudicating between contrary perspectives, ending provocatively with a quotation from the Renais- sance mystic Giordano Bruno, who argued that \"the observer is always at the center of things. \" Subtle shifts within and among narrative voices in Somnium com- plement Barba's handling of the compelling visual imagery. Black-and- white photographs are reproduced of what can be assumed, due to cross-cutting between still and moving imagery, to be documents of the site in an earlier era. At other moments slow pans interrupt still shots that frame such details as a waste pipe cantilevered over an incline. Several images of this kind directly recall motifs that Robert Smithson highlighted in his landmark text \" A Tour of the Monuments of Passaic, New Jersey, \" published in Artforum in December 1967 . There Smithson reprises a trope of landscape canon- journey through a picturesque, bucolic location to the dystopian industrial wastelands of a New Jersey backwater. Beguiled by such ruins, which, for him, could be best read as monuments to mankind's failed visions for a utopian techno- logical future, Smithson returned repeatedly to this subject, above all in the great trio of works \u2014 sculpture, film, and essay \u2014 yoked under the collective title Spiral Jetty (1970 - 72). Somnium clearly alludes to Smithson's seminal film, and not least to its hybrid wedding of first-person narrative to quotations and citations from science fiction, travel writing, literature, and science manuals in order to conflate dis- parate temporalities \u2014past, present, and future \u2014 linear, and entropic timescales. The subtext of mnemonic images and references generated by Smithson's works is as central to any reading of Somnium as the film's debt to Kepler's literary gem. Barba's project newly animates these precedents. Far from being mired in a historical past, these works, she contends, embody ahistorical voices; they are crucial components of a critical discourse that seeks to define the kind of vision required by a politically engaged contemporary cinema. A more melancholy tone inflects The Long Road (2010), which, like They Shine (2007) and The Waiting Grounds (2007), was shot in the American Southwest. Seen initially from the air in a long tracking shot, the abandoned automobile test site that is the work's visual focus resembles a prehistoric earthwork or a 1970s variant on the genre. Whether kin to the ancient Nazca Lines in Peru, only rediscovered as a result of air travel, or to the industrial-scale incursions Smithson and his peers made into remote desert terrain in the postwar years, this elliptical incision in the earth's surface is similarly subject to decay and the predations of time. The soundtrack mingles techno- electronic sounds, from which haunting microtonal phrases emerge inter mittently, with the throaty voice of Robert Creeley reading from his poem \"The Long Road. \" 6 Lynne Cooke102 103 Images pp. 102-103: Rosa Barba, transferred to video, color, sound; 19:20 min.

The implication that the end of his long road may be approaching is picked up in the final shot of the film. Now positioned at ground level, the camera circles the test track; after rounding a curve, it enters a straight stretch, down which it speeds into the late-afternoon sun. Barba imbricates these shifting vantage points of eye and voice through her editing and pacing of the camera movements and her positioning and framing of the text within the audio track. As in Somnium, a mnemonic function based on direct and indirect refer - ence to the works of other artists (a poet and nameless sculptors, in this case) is integral to the way content is elaborated. Barba's engagement with the place and role of works of art within the broader cultural imaginary was further clarified in her response to a recent commission from the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof\u00eda in Madrid. Invited to curate an exhibition from the muse- um's holdings, she responded with a proposal that she called \"a curated conference. \" Her project comprised a presentation of some forty-three works, including film and video, photography, sculpture, painting, and drawings, which she installed in two adjacent galleries. \"It is the aim of this conference to draw together a representation of artists from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, and bring their informed opinions to bear on the significant questions of art, \" she wrote in the accompanying brochure.3 Titled On the Future of Collective Strength within an Archive (2010), her display eschewed standard conventions of museological presentation, notably the segregation of art forms by medium and a linear hang arranged chronologically, in favour of an installation that juxtaposed and overlaid pieces made over the span of almost a century in close proximity. Rather than suppressing difference in service to an ideological imperative \u2014 the basis on which most collection displays are present- ed in contemporary art institutions today \u2014 she welcomed the anarchic outcome produced by a situation in which \"each artist speaks with their own voice in their own language, temperament and volume. \" Recognising that although some were recent additions, many of these artworks had long been in the collection, she invited the artists (through their works) to explore the \"collective consciousness\" within the archive. What would emerge, she anticipated, would be neither a consensual nor a coherent vision (the goal of museum professionals), but a \"Babel of voices\": the archive would be shown to be composed of \"dateless individual expressions\" that can be \"choreographed like a musical score. \" \"By negating the past and ignoring the future the artist can be free to make a radical 107statement which lasts over time ... [and generates] an energy which connects artists of all ages, \" she contended. Round-table discussions, workshops, a parallel session, and keynote speeches by Pablo Picasso, Mira Schendel, Louise Bourgeois, Martha Rosler, and others were also planned as part of the programme. Several speakers brought up con- cerns adumbrated in Barba's own practice. Thus Picasso, for example, claimed, \" All I have ever made was made for the present and with the hope that it will always remain in the present. \" In the abstract of his speech, George Maciunas underlined Barba's sense of collective identity when he termed this \"community of individuals grouping together a vast quantity of behaviors and attitudes ... a 'non-group' with no strict structures. \" Bourgeois, for her part, addressed the ways that visual works of art tell stories: through the interplay of formal qualities, \"narrative becomes a tool not a meaning, a mediator not a solution, \" she argued. Although Barba omitted her own works, and hence her own voice, from the actual discussion, she made her position vividly clear by choosing as her principal speakers artists whose aesthetic and work instantiate the key terms in her own practice. The archive was literally the source of Barba's exhibition-as- conference, given that the checklist of works on view was drawn exclu- sively from the museum's holdings, notably works from its storage. The term \"archive, \" in addition to its familiar usage as a corpus or collec- tion of data, may also be used more abstractly to refer to the system that, in Hal Foster's words, \"struc- tures the particular expressions of a particular period. \"4 This discursive notion of the archive was brought into play in Barba's project in that she critically engaged the ideology governing the presentation of the institution's collection elsewhere in its facilities, offering a subversive alternative to its norms of rep- resentational totality and historical accountability. That is, given her belief that artworks are \" ahistorical\" or \"timeless, \" they can be self- organising and come together through their creators' initiative, rather than depending on museum professionals who subsume them to disciplinary ends. Barba's innovative project can also be read through the model of the museum that Theodor W. Adorno addressed in an essay published in 1953 on what he called the \"Val\u00e9ry Proust Museum. \"5 According to Adorno, the poet Paul Val\u00e9ry espoused the position that the museum is \"where we put the art of the past to death. \" \"Museum and mausoleum are connected by more than phonetic association, \" he contended, for \"museums are like the family sepulchers of works of art. They testify to the neutralization of culture. \" In opposition to the em- balming, or reification, of the artwork that Val\u00e9ry believed took place in the museum, the novelist Marcel Proust articulated a vision based on 6 Lynne Cooke108the idea of the artwork's reanimation. The museum is consequently for him a site of agonistic competition. Echoes of Proust's ideas may be heard in Barba's curatorial confer - ence. However, whereas Proust accorded agency to the spectator, who was charged with reanimat- ing the work, Barba tellingly leaves control in the hands of artists: their works embody their voices. The Hidden Conference: About the Discontinuous History of Things We See and Don't See (2011), a 35 mm film shot shortly after Barba launched her project at the Museo Reina Sof\u00eda, explores this debate further.6 Set in an unidentified loca- tion (the storage area of the Neue Nationalgalerie in Berlin) and at \"an unspecified point in time (in the future or in the past), \" it brings to light a situation that, although exist- ing for years, the written prologue informs us, has now taken on a certain \"degree of urgency. \" None- theless, the reason for the meeting is no longer known. As the camera choreographs a miscellaneous group of art objects shrouded in noirish lighting, fragmentary narra- tives emerge but never cohere. Once again, narrative serves as \"a mediator not [as] a solution. \" Speech is subsumed into corpo- real performance, for the minimal soundtrack, by Barba's long-time collaborator Jan St. Werner, animates the works \u2014 by Ernst Barlach, Ren\u00e9e Sintenis, Gerhard Marcks, and others now sunk into anonymity \u2014 creating a sense of play through gesture, stance, posture, and regard. Far from challenging the paradigm of the archive as a failed futuristic vision, this clandestine conference confirms its rhetoric. Pathos surrounds the museum's erstwhile ambitions to representational totality, making moot the possibility of the redemp- tive salvaging of these misplaced shards of a fractured history. Several years earlier, in Western Round Table (2007), Barba had addressed the archive from a com- pletely different perspective. Her source for the work was a sym- posium convened in San Francisco in 1949 under the heading \"The Western Round Table on Modern Art. \" Aiming to \"bring a representation of the best informed opinion of the time to bear on questions of art today, \" its distinguished lineup of (all male) discussants featured critics, artists, art historians, com- posers, museum professionals, and the like, including Marcel Duchamp, Frank Lloyd Wright, Darius Milhaud, Robert Goldwater, Mark Tobey, Alfred Frankenstein, Andrew C. Richie, and Gregory Bateson.7 This time, Barba's riposte took the form of a sculptural projection. Two 16 mm projectors placed together on the ground spool clear celluloid. Each creates a spotlight of white light on an adjacent wall, into which the looming architectonic shadow of its antagonist, the other projector, enters. The soundtrack is comprised of extracts from two Federico Fellini films, cut so that the projectors appear to be conversing with each other, albeit in terms far removed from the august tone of the 109proceedings of the West Coast conference. Never quite obliterated by the mechanical sound produced by the anachronistic projectors, the musical refrains are initially teasing, entertaining, and even captivating. Soon, however, the soundtrack becomes an earworm, unforgettable and ineradicable. An epigraph to the transcript of the proceedings by Suzanne Langer contains the claim that, in characterising a philosophy, the solutions offered to questions are less revealing than the formula- tion of the problems: \"Its answers established an edifice of facts, \" she contends, \"but it's questions make the frame in which its picture of facts is plotted. \"8 When filtered through Langer's observation, Barba's idiosyncratic embodiment of the proceedings of this celebrated event into a pair of sombre architectonic silhouettes \u2014 dematerialised behe- moths speaking imperviously over each other \u2014 may not be as negative as it initially appears. That same year, 2007 , They Shine proposed that contemporary scientific imaginings are difficult to distinguish from what was once more properly the realm of science fiction.9 Something quite different emerges, however, from A Private Tableaux (2010). Images suggestive of modern cave paintings are revealed to be the tracings left in passageways under the River Mersey in Liverpool over more than a century by engineers studying pressure points created by vehicles travelling in tunnels overhead. Here, Barba, somewhat uncharacteristically, forgoes a cartographic study in favour of a semiotic enquiry that reads the abstract signs as figurative symbols. Apparently ignorant of their origins, the commentator (whose report supplies the text in this film) likens them to a form of \"automatic writing\" made by the engineers' \"subliminal selves\" \"for their own pleasure. \" They then attempt to characterize the markings that comprise these \"private tableaux\": in addition to \"a flight machine\" and \"a carriage and horses, \" there is a portrait of a young man \"drawn from memory. \" Comparing this face, with consider - able latitude, to a drawing by Jean Cocteau, the writer concludes that it \"gave its creator much trouble and little satisfaction. \" Forgoing the dispassionate objective address proper to scientific interpretation, this fanciful semiotic parsing betrays a whimsicality rare in Barba's work. Yet it is precisely the risible character of these wild surmisings that throws attention back onto the terms in which the enquiry was formulated. Once again, Barba's primary concern is the structure that frames and governs the narrative impulse. Narrative as a form of cultural critique may serves as a means of both mediating history and making sense of contemporary experience. For Italo Calvino, storytelling became a vehicle for galvanising an audience that had grown passive, first under Fascist rule and then by rapid socio- cultural developments in the postwar years. Calvino came to believe that, far from requiring a polemical illustration of ideological positions, 6 Lynne Cooke110a committed literature required the deployment of style and craft in service to a form of realism that had nothing to do with naturalism. Fiction demanded attention, \"first of all, [to] image and word, attitude, pace, style, contempt, defiance. \"10 Realism, not naturalism, is also Barba's pre- ferred mode; so, too, storytelling for her is a matter of style and attitude as much as one of craft. The sources of her narratives are culled from a wide range of literature. Sometimes, as in her use of Creeley's poem in The Long Road, she borrows directly; more often, as in Somnium and Let Me See It (2010), which is based on a story by Jorge Luis Borges, she recasts or paraphrases the original text. Literature is none- theless as fundamental to her conception of cinema as its visual counterparts. Whereas cinema is variously conceived as a kind of writing or inscription in many of Barba's film works, sculpture is deployed to literally give material form to language.11 I Made a Circuit and Then a Second Circuit (2010) is one of a group of works that might be termed protocinematic devices, for each is composed from a sheet of felt suspended in space so that it functions as both screen and projector. When light is projected onto the dark lattice from which a text has been cut, a luminous script appears on the wall beyond. The residues of one of these felt drapes comprise They Come and Go (2009). Piled into a heap on a sheet of cloth laid on the floor and lit with the beam of a projector, shards of language become an archive whose narrative potential is infinite. Barba's acuity to text extends to its modes of delivery; the voices on her audio tracks are as particular as they are memorable. The suave, confident timbre of the narrator in They Shine, for example, recalls the tones of the male leads in a certain type of Hollywood film. By cultivating that association, Barba seeks to under line the fact that the inhabitants of the uncanny milieu live between two phantasmic realities: the site on which the eerie array of reflectors was built is not far from Tinsel Town. Throughout her oeuvre, the monologues of (male) experts are always measured and cool, verging on laconic. How ever, when counterpointed with the indistinct, insecure voices of amateurs issuing uncertainly from the margins and interstices \u2014 as found in Somnium \u2014 these disci- plinary tones sound slick, and their explanatory powers suspect.12 Storytelling depends as much on the reader or listener as on the authorial voice. In literary theorist Roland Barthes's well-known formula- tion, reading (like viewing) creates a space of encounter where the reader and the multiplicity of writings that comprise any text \"blend and clash. \" Barba's richly layered exploration of this encounter is per - haps nowhere more artfully manifest than in It's Gonna Happen (2005). An imaginary conversation that could plausibly have been part of the political machinations that have 111become known as Watergate provides the raw material for what may be a scene in a forthcoming feature film. The screenwriter's directions for this scene appear as phrases projected against a black ground, while on the soundtrack a re-enactment of the conversation is played out in the form of a brief phone call. Viewers simultaneously read the texts and listen to the terse conversation in which two men plot a kidnapping, conjuring the scene in their imagination. As they strug- gle to take in both the written and spoken words unfolding in tandem but not in sync, they find themselves occupying two antipodal spaces: they are at once inside this illusory realm and outside its fictive bound- aries. Independent from yet inter - mingling with the audio track, the sound of the projectors is a spur to the realisation that an unmediated experience of cinema is no longer possible; the technologies of film and our attitudes towards it are inevitably filtered through its histories, conven- tions, and genres. By requiring her audience to negotiate between two contradictory positions, Barba enjoins them to reflect on film as a medium, and on its traditions and genres. The politics of Watergate are here both a pretext and a foil to her abiding subject: the politics of viewing. Time and again, the manifold modes of introspection that mark many of the medium's exemplary modernist projects are integral to Barba's narra- tives. Self- reflexive texts, suspended stories, and speculative imaginings become the preferred means through which she constructs a mode of viewing \u2014 an ontology of vision \u2014 appropriate to today's cinema.136 Lynne Cooke1121 Gale E.

It is subject to uneasy speculation and scepticism from bewildered locals. As in Somnium, a wryly ambivalent response to scientific imaginings in the face of nature seemingly running amok is the subject of Rivka Galchen's writings.

Though they do not interact, their voices interrupt and overlay each other, reinforcing the effects of contrast and resistance through which image and sounds are related. 13 \"The real protagonists are stories suspended in air, \" states one of the two female voices in Parachutable.1136 Lynne Cooke115A Layman's Chalice Stephan M\u00f8ller 20207 If the approach to an object of research is founded in the beginning by this thematic object of research, or, in other words, if the initial investigative approach to the object is influenced by the character of the object, it might be the case that a methodology that functions in one of these thematic relations may not function in another. It could be said, then, that what marks the difference between organic chemistry and marine zoology is a difference mirrored in the established objects of these fields, and that the project of studying dreams in neurology requires and implies \" A man and his HOBBY -HORSE, tho' I cannot say that they act and re-act exactly after the same manner in which the soul and body do upon each other: Yet doubtless there is a communication between them of some kind, and my opinion rather is, that there is something in it more of the manner of electrified bodies, - - and that by means of the heated parts of the rider, which come immediately into contact with the back of the HOBBY -HORSE. - - By long journies and much friction, it so happens that the body of the rider is at length fill'd as full of HOBBY -HORSICAL matter as it can hold; - - - - so that if you are able to give but a clear description of the nature of the one, you may form a pretty exact notion of the genius and character of the other. \" \u2014 Laurence Sterne, The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman1 Stephan M\u00f8ller116investigative approaches that differ significantly from the methods implied and required in an ethical reading of Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov. It could be the case that it would always be possible to unhinge one investigative approach in order to apply it to an-other's object, but that nothing or nonsense (or parody, as in the case of Laurence Sterne) would often be produced by this incongruence. What, then, could be said of art as an academic field? Does it have defining thematic objects of research and established general methods? And if it does, what is the correspondence between the objects of research and the investigative approach? It might already be suggested that the uniform field does not exist. It might also be said that it is a prejudice \u2014 albeit maybe not a very interesting one \u2014 that there is a set of core values and a methodological role model when justifying academic work. Maybe this role model is imaginary: an imaginary adversary conjured to define a position. The case may be that a universal role model of a positivist world view \u2014 an objectivity that assumes a self-identity, and that does not realise its own character as a condition or presumption, and that requires a certain kind of result \u2014 has seeped into and defined an academic atmosphere. Then again, the universal idea of a unified and unifying object of research that defines a uniform and unified methodological approach might be an anachronistic dream that haunts me and requires unjustly justification. I cannot be expected, can I, to justify myself to those who do not experience art, much less appreciate it? Certainly, sometimes I would like to think so, but I have time and again used other fields of knowledge, traditions, methods, and research in my own projects, which are un doubtedly categorised, experienced, and created as art. Time and again, I have adopted and mimicked a method or mined information from another sphere of knowledge. Whatever the expectation, some kind of justification or appropriate attitude seems necessary to facilitate this sometimes parasitic involvement. That is to say: How do I experience art as an academic field, a field of research and education, when I interact with other fields, other spheres of knowledge? (I do not expect to make general laws of subjective experience here, though this routine is not altogether foreign, one could argue, to any of us.) A Way of Looking at Things I tend to begin with the too general, and then end up in the inordinately particular. It is a well ingrained habit of mine to ride my hobby-horse along these paths \u2014 to start with extreme generalisation, as beginning from the base of a triangle and cutting through the middle to end up in the top point. Along the way I might jump a few fences, or go too fast along some shortcuts ...117 To talk about relations and structures of things and the investigation of these things is also to talk about both common and special attitudes and a tradition of thinking about these often radically different attitudes. It has been my expectation to find a rational attitude outside of art, and to see it rigidly orientated towards knowledge production. It goes without saying, I think, that this is a completely necessary academic attitude. When I interact with these discipline-specific fields, researching and using studies of, for example, biology or forensic science, the general artistic attitude sets itself apart. As such, in this context, my projects are without results. That philosophy is not necessarily a field of study with a rigorous orientation towards a production of particular results \u2014 that is to say, that it might not proceed along an established method, that it can be, might always be, without results \u2014 is a belief that defines the way I read philosophical texts. It could be argued, and I would like to do so, that at their initial moments, philosophy and science share a kind of funda- mental thinking, a foundational moment before one progresses in method and action into scientificity. Then, where one progresses, the other can choose to remain. I would like to think that, in the beginning, in this first room, philosophy and art can likewise be characterised comparatively. That art not necessarily progresses as a subject-field, but can take its time to view subjects and subject-fields. The expectations of the object being fulfilled by a rigorously defined investigative approach, as well as the clinical or technical use of the information achieved by such methods, can be completely suspended in art. That is why my work, when it results in art, is without result. But if, in the assumed first moment, these attitudes suspend the expectation of the world as commonly and completely manifested in itself, then there is a link here, between how the artist, the philosopher, and the scientist experiences their worlds. Of course, this is neither a new or original thought; rather, it might be a bit old-fashioned. There are very old traditions connecting aesthetic contemplation and the curious theoretical spectator; the theoretician and the aesthete both oppose a \"natural\" everyday pragmatism. These forms of experience, of looking and living, have before been expected to have something in common. Well before the establishment of epistemology and aesthetics, philosophical contemplation was also aesthetic contemplation: \"Since the Greek world view (Weltanschauung) conceives of the world as k\u00f3smos \u2014 which literally means decoration, even jewelry \u2014 viewing the world as it really is by philosophical contemplation means perceiving it as a universe of systematic order which is in itself understood as rationally structured and, therefore, beautiful.\"2 This fundamental idea of k\u00f3smos reveals that contemplating the world's structure meant contemplating beauty, that the \"world\" 7 Stephan M\u00f8ller118and \"beauty\" \u2014 words so different to us \u2014 were inseparable to the Greeks. Investigative world viewing, then, is generally opposed to a common eye obscured by pragmatism. Already Aristotle referred to theoria as a special attitude, a special way of looking at things, which he exalted as the contemplation of wise folk, the actualisation of knowl- edge, to the detriment of the practical.3 To get back to the discussion at hand, we might say that, in talking about art, we're talking about a special sort of experience and contemplation, but we're also talking about a subject-field (genstandsfelt ) acting as condition for producing things (genstande).4 Edmund Husserl, as a more recent philosopher, was specifically engaged with phenomenological attitudes of world viewing. It might be possible to link the aesthetical and the philosophical world viewing in his thinking, maybe even to link them in ways that are beneficial to me \u2014 that is to say, to link them in a way that delineates my position when dealing with other fields of study through my artistic practice. Nothing much will be said here of Husserl's life and thought, other than some general remarks, and some maybe not so general considerations of a remarkable letter to his friend, the wunderkind and poet Hugo von Hofmannsthal: As soon as the sphinx of knowledge has posed its question, as soon as we have looked into the abyssal depths of the possibility of a knowledge that would be enacted in subjective experiences and yet contain an in-itself existing objectivity, our attitude to all pre-given knowledge and all pre-given being \u2014 to all of science and all assumed reality \u2014 has become a radically different one. Everything questionable, everything incomprehensible, everything enigmatic! The enigma can only be solved if we place ourselves on its own ground and treat all knowledge as questionable, and accept no existence as pre-given.5 A suspension of the typicality of the world is here also a gripping moment of astonishment. When our natural expectations of the world fall away, everything is rendered radically different in this moment of genuine curiosity. To say it another way: the one finding themselves questioned by the sphinx becomes poor in knowledge; that is to say, when astonished by the questions of the sphinx, one does not know what to expect. The philosopher, in this case, finds themselves drawn away and detached from an original state of affairs, drawn to a place where everything has become questionable and all they knew enigmatic. We could argue, then, that this poverty, this suspension of knowledge, is why this sphinx is a sphinx of knowledge. Husserl then claims that this attitude \u2014 the attitude of the philosopher \u2014 has something in common with an aesthetical attitude:119It demands an attitude towards all forms of objectivity that funda- mentally departs from its \"natural\" counterpart, and which is closely related to the attitude and stance in which your art, as something purely aesthetic, places us with respect to the presented objects and the whole of the surrounding world. The intuition of a purely aesthetic work of art is enacted under a strict suspension of all existential atti- tudes of the intellect and of all attitudes relating to emotions and the will which presuppose such an existential attitude. Or more precisely: the work of art places us in (almost forces us into) a state of aesthetic intuition that excludes these attitudes. The more of the existential world that resounds or is brought to attention, and the more the work of art demands an existential attitude of us out of itself (for instance a naturalistic sensuous appearance: the natural truth of photography), the less aesthetically pure the work is.6 At the very least, the philosophical and the aesthetical contemplation share a point of opposition: the famously named natural attitude. The attitude I have somewhat, so far, tiptoed around. This attitude, which so far has only been mentioned in order to transcend it, could become (when lifted from its proper context) synonymous with a heap of un- reflected presuppositions, a heap only there to be overcome by the phi- losopher; but we must not forget that, according to Husserl, this attitude is the foundation of all human activity. It can never be completely nullified. All attitudes stem from it, all attitudes come forth from it, because it is in relation to it \u2014 the natural attitude, that is \u2014 that they differ. If we go a little further into Husserl's thoughts on what philosophical and aesthetic theorising (theoria) could have in common, we might say that they both share a strict suspension of all existential attitudes; that is, they share an exclusion of any positing of something as existing. To borrow a clear formulation: \"In the neutrality modification it has the index of the 'as if. '\"7 The world is, in this case and at this point, turned into phenomenon. So, what is special about this \"as if\" that is somewhat shared by (though not identical with) the philosophical attitude? If aesthetic contemplation neutralises every existential attitude, then it must also find itself in a position other than one of a specialised view within the natural attitude. This means that within the aesthetical attitude, specialised views can be viewed and specialised worlds experienced differently; that is to say, we have given this attitude a function comparative to the phenomenolog- ical reduction. In this \"neutrality modification, \" everything can be viewed aesthetically and the world(s) can let new meanings shine through them. So far, we are still talking about art, not necessarily as a series of progres- sions internal to the field of art, but as a possible relation to subjects and other subject-fields. To get at the particular instance of an artwork as it is experienced by a viewer and the premise of this particular instance, we could follow 7 Stephan M\u00f8ller120the trait stemming from these parallels between philosophical and aesthetical attitudes. We have already touched upon it, as it relates to the possibility of being drawn into the work as Husserl describes. At question is this ability of the artwork \u2014 the power to give us experiences that break off, in radical ways, from the normal way we go about things. An instance where everything can be brought into question, where everything can become enigmatic. New meanings and senses arise, and then, the poverty of knowledge becomes a richness, a freedom in thought and activity. (This meeting maybe comparable to the approach of the artist to other established bodies of knowledge, other regional worlds, and the potential suspension of these bodies' expectations.) Before accepting all this too readily, we must remember that Husserl wrote within his own time, and we might see a problem in adopting these views when thinking about his privileging of the less sensual, and therefore \"purer, \" artwork. We might also see a problem with a supposed parallel between a well-defined phenomenological reduction, where the freedom of thought is countered by the philosopher's responsibility to be a functionary of mankind, and an aesthetical reduction, which might not have as well-defined responsibilities.8 To let go of the specificity of Husserl's thought, I might end on this positive note: all this is very enabling for my work. At least in the sense that it positions my attitude in dealing with these other discipline-specific bodies of knowledge. To me, it is also a beautiful way of thinking about the way we enter the art- work. The premise of its viewing. How it might suspend our expectations of the world and set out a temporary model of it. In another sense, this sequence of propositions falls within a discussion of the ontology of the work of art and the ontological potential of art as subject-field. Consideration of these potentials has, from the beginning, been essential to how I go about my artistic practice; but how important these con- siderations are generally to art itself, that I do not know. It might not always be the artist's responsibility to account for the ontological status of their work, and if the artist, as depicted in these Husserlian propositions, does not share the rigorously defined responsibilities of a philosophy bound to systematic, scientific thinking, then the lack of this responsibility might be exactly this freedom: the freedom to not (but not necessarily not) theorise in order to make points. Shelves, Laymen, and Hobby-Horses I might say about those of my works, the ones I have spoken about that rely on other bodies of knowledge, that, in making them, I am not involved in \"artistic research\" but rather \"research as an artist. \" Both of these kinds of research, I would argue, expect to provoke an opinion, at least in an academic setting, of and from academia.121 There has been talk of fields of study as volumes on a shelf and indications of systems that allow for labelling and for things to find their proper place. Such a shelf is, among other places, the edu cational institution, and in this particular case the university and the art academy. Once, before I began studying at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, I thought of art as homeless and unlabelled. I had a difficult time justifying, on the one hand, an intellectual rigour and, on the other, an intellectual light- hearted ness in the doing and thinking involved in making art. This difficulty dissolved somewhat when entering the context of the academy. I like to think of this institution as an especially polymorphic place. The diversity of the art academy \u2014 the extreme difference both between and in the students' practices, but also in the teaching (where else can you go from welding class to a meticulous reading of Theodor W. Adorno \u2014 might mirror \"art\" as notion, the overshadowing word that \"art\" is, and that many-sided field beneath it.9 If, as a layperson, I try to follow Husserl, and if I write somewhat in the way he has written, it would be right to say that Martin Heidegger also thought and wrote about these attitudes and subjects, and that Heidegger's famous sentence \"Science does not think\" became one of the inspirations for the mood of this text.10 It is important to note, though, that Heidegger also said in that same text, \"Most thought- provoking is that we are still not thinking, \"11 and further that when he said \"Science does not think, \" it might not have been an objection \u2014 or at least not as forceful an objection \u2014 to science itself so much as to a general devaluation of other methodologies and spheres of knowledge. That is to say, he objects to an dominant epistemological scientific standard. I've made this short digression in order to say that, when the claim is made that \"science and philosophy are radically different, but might share a fundamental moment, \" it is not always that simple, and to read Husserl and Heidegger is to discover such complexities. To read Heidegger's texts and enter into his books can also be to fall into a hole. To write about him can seem just as dangerous. Heidegger writes about the difference between research and thinking, and about philosophy as either thinking or research. He says that within the institu- tion, he fears, philosophy becomes something that it is not. He has a \"both tactless and tasteless\" fear of what happens to philosophy and thinking in the frame of the institution.12 A fear of philosophy becoming philosophy-science, philosophy-history \u2014 that is to say, a philosophy that does not participate in the ontological enquiries at the centre of scien- tific crises. A philosophy not alive and actual because it does not do the potentially revolutionary work of questioning the ontological presupposi- tions that lead the sciences. The considerations are tactless and tasteless because they are formulated by the professor, they are said aloud within the institution of the university; at a lecture, Heidegger spoke about this to his audience.7 Stephan M\u00f8ller122 To return to the subject of art: a fear like this was never warranted for me as a student, during my time at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. Art was never in danger of becoming synonymous with a historical determination. I did not experience the doing at the Academy as in danger of becoming devoid of an actual and alive element. Not because art there was univer - sally engaged with rigorous ontological questioning; rather, it was not \"actual\" in this directly Heideggerian sense, but in the sense that it was not calmed, subsided by tradition. It was a tactless and tasteless work that never stopped questioning itself, a doing that in itself questioned the (what I assumed was) institutional attitude. I, in my own dealings with both philosophy, science, and carpentry, had and have a special tactlessness, a special privilege \u2014 a layman's privilege.13 Hobby-horse riders are often, but not always, laypersons. That in itself the meaning of this word can be faintly offensive \u2014 that is, if used correctly \u2014 cannot be denied. The word \"layman\" somewhat delineates the ordinary, the common, the non-specialised view. The angle of the amateur. To speak in lay terms is to disseminate some complicated content in simplified formulations, that is to say, to cut down on technicalities and jargon: to be plain. It stems from the Greek laikos meaning \"of the people, \" referring to ordinary folk. The primary historical meaning of \"layman\" (laikos through the Latin laicus, then the old French lai, to \"laity, \" meaning \"secular\"), refers to all believers that aren't part of the clergy, the body of the congregation. Here is firstly a religious hierarchy and secondly an educational and linguistic one. I cannot deny, when interacting with other fields, that I am a lay - person. In fact, I would insist on it. To me it is exactly this secularism that makes me free of the expectations of certain disciplines, subjects, objects, and things. Free from a rational, even a philosophical, attitude. That is not to say all artists are universal laypeople, but it is to say that when I use information produced within other rigorously defined fields, ones that depend on strictly framed methodological approaches, I do not fulfil the structure of this field. I do not fulfil the potential of a certain investigative object. Something else shines through the informa- tion. The result reached by rigorous research is hijacked, other potentials are harvested in the twisting and turning, the tactless unhinging and tasteless use. I am exactly a layman. A Way of Writing (and Writing about Writing) about Things If all this happened to be serviceable, how, then, would text work inside an artwork, on what premise would text fold into it? This question leads to a more general one: Does language dress or undress (the) experience (of the artwork)?123 Maybe it was not a coincidence that it became essential to me, in the first half of my studies, to present texts in my projects. Until this inclusion, my texts had been private and writing was something I did on the side. But it became my focus to include texts, and to include them on the premise of the installation, in my artworks. In these installations, I did not manipulate the material of the letters, these printed or written forms that, as long as they are readable, will always claim their own body. It was important to me that in the reading situation \u2014 the situation of being in front of text, engaging with it as with any text \u2014 that the reading itself, was as close to a normal reading experience as possible.14 That is not to say that the text found itself in any insignificant room; it rather found itself in the structure of the specific installation. But I hoped and liked to think that this context facilitated an attitude and a relation to this experience of this artwork without altering the reading situation in itself. My inten- tion was to include a reading happening in intersections between other ex periences and other languages, all occurring within the physical and conceptual thematic structure of the installation, as it unfolded for a potentially, hopefully, interested viewer. Outside or inside installations, that peculiar and subtle body of language already functions on distinct terms. It would be just to talk about it. To actually involve oneself with some investigation of language instead of just saying it \u2014 but the issue is huge. It's a topic somewhat incompatible with the length of the descriptions of my hobby-horses in this present text, and to my mind, to be honest, to talk about art is in some way to talk about language (not necessarily in a philosophical or academic way, but possibly so). To become involved with text and language would be to make this fluctuating sketch even more erratic. Suffice it to say, the bonds and interrelations of language and art were and still are one of my hobby- horses, and that in the artwork one can relate in a fundamental way to text and the texts unfolding, and can bring this relation into the particular thematic relation of the work. That is to say, it is not only the text and its contents that is brought into the artwork's citation, but also the reading itself. So far I might have laid a cloth and folded it around this subject. Maybe I have neared this whole matter through external means and described it through some instrument wholly other than itself. In so doing, I might have placed a doing in an inappropriate thinking. I don't think there is a lot of sculpture in this text, but I don't know how much of this text might be in my sculpture. That is to say: there might be other potentials, inextinguishable and always slipping away, dropped by the mouth and hand and just outside of these words. Academic research as artistic research is not an uncontroversial matter, and the academisation of art can be argued both for and against and can find support or reservation both inside and outside art as an academic or unacademic discipline. To argue that art should resist academisation altogether strikes me as radical. 7 Stephan M\u00f8ller124But to say that an element of it might resist academisation, maybe even resist these words altogether\u2014that is another condition, a hopeful condition. On the other side of this coin: if I have made art complicit with some philosophical determination, it is firstly because of habit, secondly because this debate is my dearest hobby-horse, and thirdly because I do not know how to claim to write of things in and of them- selves. It strikes me as something that might always be just on the other side, somewhere other than right here. A manifestation that cannot be written. To write it might be to push it away. 1 Laurence Sterne, The Life and Opinions of T ristram Shandy, Gentleman (Ware, UK: Wordsworth Editions, 1996), 53. As this text is partly about habits, I might admit to a habit of referencing T ristram Shandy almost every single time I set out to write something remotely theoretical about my artistic practice. It is not only due to laziness, I hope, but due to the remarkable ability of this book to offer its opinion, some mood-setting quote or quirk. This book is perpetually casting its influence on my texts. 2 Sebastian Luft, \"Husserl on the Artist and the Philosopher, \" Glimpse 1, no. 1 (1999): 46. Emphases in the original. For further information, see Erik Lund, 3 If all this had to fall within a more rigorous study, some work would have to be done to separate a few of these concepts that might be glued together here. There might be some kind of difference between a philosophy of art and aesthetics, though they are intertwined. The latter has been generally occupied with, and maybe somewhat historically dominated by, beauty. What is important to note here is that the kind of contemplation of the world involved in experiencing beauty of the ancient Greek cosmic order is not exactly, not even remotely, the same as the contemplation of an artwork today, but that does not mean interesting connections are not rendered visible by thinking about these possible and fundamental etymological links. These connections are all very quickly drawn here; to complicate them somewhat, I refer you to Heather L. Reid and T ony Leyh, eds., Looking at Beauty to Kalon in Western Greece, (Sioux City, IA: Parnassos P 2019).1254 \"Subject-field\" here replaces the Danish \"genstands- felt, \" which stems from the German gegenstand, \"that which stands, \" which has the connotations of themenfeld and gegenstandsbereich. Genstand in itself has the first meaning of \"object, \" but also the much broader and more dynamic definition of: \"what a feeling, event or action is directed at. \" Themenfeld as connotation is much closer to \"subject-field, \" that is, \"the theme of a field of investigation. \" T o use genstandsfelt is to use a very broad term, including both a movement and process and a relation to object and subject. My original sentence reads: \"For at en erfaring og oplevelse, ogs\u00e5 om en type et genstandsfelt som betingelse for produktionen af genstande. \" 5 Edmund Husserl, letter to Hugo von Hofmannsthal, published as \"Letter to Hosmannsthal, \" trans.

I followed her aro und doing housework and picking vegetables in the garden. I learned to cook in Aunt Jo's kitchen, which was dominated by a mammo th wood-burning stove\u2014the primary heat source for the two-story twelve-room farmhouse she lived in her en tire life, along with her bro ther. Han dmade quilts, homemad e bed s stuffed with down and feathers, and hot-water bo ttles lled from the kettle permanently lodged atop the stove supplied local warmth at bedtime. That stove must have been pretty large, in fact as in memo ry, since Aunt Jo man - aged to cook a giant turkey dinner wi th an impressive range of vegetable and side dishes, as w ell as a p antry full of pies, for twenty or so family member s every Thanksgiving. Aunt Jo's life revolved around her daily list.

There w ere co nsistent tasks of baking cookies, cakes, and pies, preparing break fast, lunch, and supper, and shopping in town at the supermark et and Woolworth's. There w ere family visits and social calls on neighbors. There w ere h oliday celebrations.

I must have given her an explanation as sh e let me o ff the hook\u2014\"I'm not sure, I'll tell you later,\" or \"I don't want to think about that.\" The scen e is both vivid and vague in my mind's eye. Whether it actually happened or is something I wished for or dreamed I can 't be cer tain. I was fourteen when Aunt Jo got sick and went in the hospi- tal. My mother wouldn't let me g o see h er. She'd turned yellow, I was told\u2014jaundice or hepatitis. She was dead soon after.

Eager to protect me f rom pain and \"negative things,\" my mother prohibited me f rom going. On numero us occasi ons, Aunt Jo asked me t o plant a potato plant on her grave someday. Aunt Jo sputtered incessantly about her bro ther, Uncle Carl . \"That man ,\" she'd say disdainfully as if the reaso ns for her co n- tempt were sel f-evident, \"that man ; just look at him.\" Some time af ter sh e died, he also led me i nto the pantry so I could show him what I wanted and take \"the damn stuff\" with me.

I wanted two or three ser ving platters. And there w as the smal l pitcher wi th blue flowers painted on it that I'd long coveted. When Uncle Carl reached for it, I was scared it would have someone else's name on the bottom, but it didn't. Most precious were Aunt Jo's everyday dishes, which I didn't dare u se for forty years. When I nally began to last spring, I shattered a cereal bowl the rst week. (Storing things that are \" too good to use\" is a family trait. After my grandmother died, we found one of her bureau draw- ers utterly stuffed with ne soaps and fancy packages of body powder\u2014a h alf-century of gifts.)

With the transfer co mpleted, he mo tioned to the jars lined up on the pantry counter\u2014t he year's bounty of his signature seri ously sour pickles. Uncle Carl didn't waste pickles on people he didn't care f or; offering a jar was telling.

Uncle Carl 's personal chair was nestled in the corner bet ween the stove and a window that looked out onto the road.

Reprinted by permission of Chika Okeke\u00adAgulu, personal re\u00ad presentative of Enwezor's estate. On April 27, 1934, Walter Benjamin delivered a lecture at the Institute for the Study of Fascism in Paris. In the lecture, \"The Author as Producer,\" Benjamin addressed an important question that, since, has not ceased to pose itself: namely, to what degree does political awareness in a work of art serve as a tool for the deracination of the autonomy of the work and that of the author? To address this vexing issue, Benjamin proposed firstly that any work of art that wishes to address political issues must by necessity avoid doing so dogmatically. But, most importantly, such work should not just show the political character of the work but should include its artistic quality as well. Here is how he outlines the programme of such a work: \"You can declare: a work that shows the correct political tendency need show no other quality. You can also declare: a work that exhibits the cor - rect tendency must of necessity have every other quality.\"1 For Benjamin, \"the tendency of a literary work can be politically correct only if it is also literarily correct.\"2 Contrary to the reception of works that show a clear Okwui Enwezor146political tendency as empty of aesthet- ic integrity, Benjamin's formulation inscribes a much more rigorous test for any work aspiring to combine the qualities of the aesthetic and the political in a single work. Rather than abjure such work, he raised the critical stakes of what such a work must aspire to. This distinction is important for the issues that I will take up throughout this text in relation to certain conceptions of artistic work by practitioners working beyond the standard aesthetic nomenclature of modern art, namely the autonomy of the work of art through its formal separation from its socio cultural context. I should also point out that Benjamin's point was made during a period of incredible pressure on artists and intellectuals to commit themselves to an alliance with certain revolutionary programmes during the 1930s. Therefore, his evaluation was to locate what a radical critical spirit in art could be in a time of such mo- mentous, yet undecided, direction in the political consciousness of Europe: between the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the productivist model of artistic practice it instantiated and the storms of repression unleashed by fascism and Nazism in Western Europe. In a sense, Benjamin's lecture addressed the question of the artist's or writer's commitment under certain social conditions. This would lead him to bypass the question that he raised \u2014 namely, \"What is the attitude of a work to the relations of produc- tion of its time?\" \u2014 for a far more engaged investigation, which is \"What is its position in them?\"3 Georg Luk\u00e1cs posed a similar question in his 1932 essay \"' Tendency' or Partisanship?,\"4 in which he identifies a prevailing tension between the work of art and its time against an opposing point of view. What were the relations of production at the time Benjamin and Luk\u00e1cs were writing and how do they compare to those of today? The situation in Europe in the 1930s was marked by a profound crisis in the international public sphere, and therefore could be said to generate a situation in which all art was produced under a climate of instability and political uncertainty. In the Soviet Union, the Bolshevik revolution, which attempted to dissolve the regulatory distinction between classes, became a victim of Stalinism, while the crisis of the Weimar Republic brought Adolf Hitler and the Nazis to power, while the Italian monarchy fell to Benito Mussolini's Fascist Party. The global financial crisis of 1929 after the collapse of the stock market, which led to the Great Depression, further exacerbated the situation. These changes beginning in the 1920s and intensifying in the 1930s had a pro- found effect on the work of the artistic avant- gardes, not least because a climate of partisan ship was produced, bringing about a separation between opposing ideological forces and artistic tendencies, not just on the political front but in the cultural and artistic sphere as well. In the artistic sphere in Europe, the work of Dada artists is part of this legacy, while in the United States, artists of the Harlem Renaissance embarked on a kind of representation- al art that sought to depict the nature of Black life under the segre- gationist politics of the American South. The same impulse could be seen in the context of Mexico, where artists attempted to merge the formal methods of the modernist avant-garde to the realism of socialist 147idealism. In Europe, the emergence of N\u00e9gritude among expatriate African and Caribbean writers and artists (in alliance with surrealism) is part of the spirit of artistic activism of this period. It is important to note the international dimension of this moment. One may not go so far as to identify the current situation within the global public sphere as similar to that of the 1930s, but they are comparable in two senses: firstly in the deepening sense of crisis that overhangs the entire political sphere, and secondly in the feeling of insecu- rity and instability such a crisis has produced within the cultural sphere. In the artistic context, today this is clear in the attempts by leading cultural institutions and critics in the media to delegitimise artistic works that bear direct relation to the prevailing political climate of today. In museums, the recent return to canonical art and the historical recuperation of major careers is but a symptom of such attempts at closure that mirrors the one in the political sphere. It would be unnecessary to explicate here that from the forces of insecurity and instability (across all fields) has emerged a crisis of legitimation that surrounds all cultural production. Today artistic production is once again caught up in a line of separation between ideological forces: between the purveyors of beauty for beauty's sake in art, and practices that insistently attempt to link form and content in the production of artworks in an explicit manner in the social realm. This link, evidenced in many cases as the connection between the social and cultural, political and artis- tic, constitutes a form of \"social aes- thetics\"5 whereby artists attempt to go beyond the demands of conventional aesthetic norms to comment on the social crisis that pervades all relations of production and reception. However, with the present dispensation of social repression of the memory of past critical activism in the art world (most recently of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s and 1990s), what we are con- fronted with in the distinction between artistic imperatives is not a climate of functioning, open, public debate in the leading institutions and media. Rather, the opposite effect is taking root via a pervasive cultural amnesia and the brutal flattening of the artistic field into a market-sanctioned production of taste, discrete narratives, and a curatorial disinclination to view artistic practice in a light not sanctioned by museological norms. The forms of con- temporary art that are on offer in this realignment of aesthetic and critical forces, when viewed in the context of the changes occurring in the political and cultural field, appear either strate- gically ambiguous or obtusely opaque. If we look back at the period of the early 1920s and 1930s and the conditions of production of that time, we identify it as the clearest moment to observe the struggle between capitalism and socialism as the driving forces behind modern subjectivity. Today, the nature of globalisation and its unleashing of forces of homo- genisation and domination confronts cultural producers of all stripes with a different environment within which to think knowledge in relation to power. It has been a mistake of the artistic sphere in the last decade to try to suppress the articulation of this dialectic by art and artists. As in the period of the 1930s, the complexity of the artistic field needs more than ever to make the site of artistic reception a space of vigorous, open contestation 9 Okwui Enwezor148and engagement. The field of contem- porary art and practitioners within it are broad and are diverse enough to admit this necessity. Proscriptions against one form of art or against another, however, limits the possibility of artists to truly function in a properly autonomous manner. For the purposes of reviewing the positions of artistic practice in the current context, perhaps it would benefit our investigation to extend the questions raised by Benjamin and Luk\u00e1cs in their respective texts and apply them to the critical context of contemporary art today. The insights to be gained from these two thinkers are relevant towards understanding and decoding a visible turn that has become increasingly evident in the field of culture at large; that is, a certain critical activism in contempo- rary art has become a way to re-pose the questions each of them raised seventy years ago. I do so by recourse to a mode of artistic activity known as \"collective practices.\" My focus is not on activism per se, but rather on work driven by the spirit of activism but otherwise aligned to the methods of art. To that end, recent confrontations within the field of contemporary art have precipitated an awareness that there have emerged in increasing numbers, within the last decade, new, critical artistic formations that foreground and privilege the mode of collective and collaborative pro- duction. But the question to ask is whether this presages the return of the repressed: a bite out of the Proustian madeleine in which memory of a social unconscious much in evidence in older collective practices from the 1950s to the 1980s \u2014 from the Letterist Inter - national and Situationist Inter national to Laboratoire Agit'Art, the Art Workers' Coalition, and Group Material \u2014 reappears in the neon glow of a newly minted radicality. If this return could be linked to some of these earlier examples, then we must ask: Is the collectivisation of artistic pro- duction really a critique of the poverty of the language of contemporary art in the face of large-scale commodifica- tions of culture that have merged the identity of the artist with the corporate logo of global capitalism? Or is it just a retooling of the old avant-garde mode of dissent already disciplined by museum collections? These questions shadow the return of collectivity in contemporary artistic practice. Given its present insistence and the broad geographic area in which it has sprout- ed, it appears that something more than art world fashion is the guiding principle behind this turn. Therefore, to ignore the consequences of the disaffection with contemporary artistic practice, and the brutal positionings that take place within the art world by artists working within this mode, is to miss the vital power of disso- nance that is part of the appeal for the contemporary thinkers and artists who propose collectivity as a course of artistic work. Of course, we need not be reminded that there is nothing novel about collectivity in art as such. It's been a crucial strategy \u2014 and a \"tendency,\" in the sense deployed by Luk\u00e1cs \u2014 of the avant-garde throughout the twentieth century. How has this \"tendency\" been deployed? According to Luk\u00e1cs, \"Tendency\" ... is something very relative. In bourgeois literary theory ... a text is seen as display- ing \"tendency\" if its class basis and aim are hostile (in class terms) to the prevailing orientation; 149one's own \"tendency,\" therefore, is not a \"tendency\" at all, but only that of one's opponent. The posi- tions of struggle that the various literary factions of the bourgeoisie took up against one another, in which connection, of course, it was generally the more politically and socially progressive trend that was particularly reproached for its \"tendency,\" rather than the reactionary trend, were as- sumed with double vigour against the first beginnings of proletarian literature.6 This reproach of \"politically and socially progressive\" work for its \"tendency\" illuminates succinctly the key point of ideological struggle evident in contemporary art today. Of course, it would be naive to speak of the key ideological tussle today as being between bourgeois and pro- letarian culture. Or that social relations are fundamentally determined by class antagonism. Yet, a persistent antagonism between two socially differentiated ideals of artistic practice remains in the definitions and de- definitions of art; between aesthetic and anti-aesthetic positions much like Luk\u00e1cs addresses in his essay. This tension is particularly acute with work that takes an overtly realistic approach to the representation of social life, whereby \"any depiction of society, whether the society of the proletariat or that of the bourgeoisie, and no matter whether this was presented from the class standpoint of the proletariat itself or simply from one close to it, was viewed as 'tenden- tious,' and every possible argument as to its 'inartistic' and 'hostile-to-art' character was marshaled against it.\"7 While such antique terms as the \"bourgeois\" and the \"proletariat\" concept of society have become intellectually inoperative as descrip- tors of the contestation of values within contemporary art, the even more antique notions of \"tradition\" and \"canon\" endure and remain powerful. Institutions of art and mainstream critics, in fact, insist on them. So what does the artist, disenchanted and alienated from the limited and limiting options of working within a specified grid of modernist artistic conduct, do? If not exactly an outright revolutionary or believer that art can affect any kind of change, there is, minimally, a level of earnest belief (oftentimes treated derisively by cynical critics, especially in times of political repression such as is again current) in Karl Marx's dictum that the intellectual's revolutionary role is not to interpret but to change the world. That artists readily subscribe to this dictum can be detected in a variety of forms of collective or collaborative work. Therefore, a proper under - standing of collectivity will have to be traced through its affinities, with past examples, as a tendency of artists' responses to relations of production in their times. This story belongs to the history of modernism proper. The position of the artist working within collective and collaborative processes subtends earlier manifesta- tions of this type of activity throughout the twentieth century. Collectivity (a good example of its most intelle c- tually stringent form is the work of Art & Language) performs an operation of irruption and transformation on traditional mechanisms and activities of artistic production that locate the sole figure of the individual artist at the centre of authorship. Under the historical conditions of modernist reification, collective or collaborative practices \u2014 that is, the making of an 9 Okwui Enwezor150artwork by multiple authors across porous disciplinary lines \u2014 generate a radical critique of artistic ontology qua the artist, and as such also ques- tion the enduring legacy of the artist as an autonomous individual within modernist art. This concerns the au- thenticity of the work of art and its link to a specific author. However, there is a level at which the immanence of this discourse is also evidenced in the critique of the author in post- modernism. On both levels, I would argue that the anxieties that circum- scribe questions concerning the authenticity of either the work of art or the supremacy of the artist as author are symptomatic of a cyclical crisis in modernity about the relation- ship of art to its social context and the status of the artist as more than an actor within the economic sphere within which art operates. This crisis has been exceptionally visible in all the decades of the twentieth century. Historically, collectives tend to emerge during periods of crisis, in moments of social upheaval and po- litical uncertainty within society. After the relative tranquillity of the 1950s, which was a period of coming to terms with the immense destruction of World War II, the political and cultural climate of the 1960s \u2014 evidenced by national liberation movements in the former European colonies, the discord of the Vietnam War, the civil rights move- ment in the United States, the rise of military dictatorships in Latin America, and the women's movement, among many other changes \u2014 opened up the discursive space of culture to new articulations of cultural resistance and artistic critique. The crisis of the 1960s not only changed the rules of engage- ment in the critical spheres of culture, but it also forced reappraisals of con- ditions of production, the re-evaluation of the nature of artistic work, and the reconfiguration of the position of the artist in relation to economic, social, cultural, and political institutions. If the evaluative context of collectivity flows from the contestatory demands of po- litical, social, and cultural formations, then there are two types of collective and collaborative practices that are important for this discussion. The first type can be summarised as possessing a structured modus vivendi based on permanent, fixed groupings of practi- tioners working over a sustained period. In such collectives \u2014 for example, London-based groups such as Black Audio Film Collective and Sankofa Film and Video Collective, and New York-based collectives such as Group Material \u2014 authorship represents the expression of the group rather than that of the individual artist. The second type of collective tends to emphasise a flexible, non-permanent course of affiliation \u2014 here the Situationist Inter - national is the best paradigm \u2014 privi- leging collaboration on a project basis rather than on a permanent alliance between its members. This type of collective formation can be designated as a \"networked collective,\" working across affinities of interest whether artistic, discursive, or ideological. Such networks are far more prevalent today due to radical advances in communication technologies in the age of globalisation, whereby a group can engage in a sustained collabora- tive work with multiple individuals and organisations as Raqs Collec- tive, Multiplicity, Le Groupe Amos, and Huit Facettes do in New Delhi, Milan, Kinshasa, and Dakar, respectively. However, if we are to trace the emergence of the artist as pro- ducer in times of crisis, we must do so by first linking up with modernism. Consequently, in collective work 151we witness immediately the compli- cation of modernism's idealisation of the artwork as the unique object of individual creativity. For in collective work what is forcefully delineated is the simultaneous aporia of artwork and artist. In the immediate sense, this delineation tends to lend collective work a social or political rather than artistic character, thereby radically viti- ating the normative rules of modernist formalism and its insistence on the primacy of the artistic object. As such, the collective imaginary has often been understood as essentially politi- cal in orientation, with minimal artistic instrumentality. In other instances, shared labour, collaborative practice, and the collective conceptualisation of artistic work have been understood as the critique of the reification of art and the commodification of the artist. Though collaborative or collective work has long been accepted as nor - mal in the kind of artistic production that requires ensemble work, such as in music and architecture for example, in the context of visual art, over which the individual artistic talent reigns, such loss of singularity of the artist is much less the norm, particularly under the operative conditions of capitalism. Over the centuries, there have been different kinds of groupings of artists \u2014 in guilds, associations, unions, workshops, schools, movements. How- ever, each of these instances always recognised the individual artist as the sine qua non of such associational be- longing. In fact, the idea of ensemble or collective work for the visual artist under capitalism is anathema to the traditional ideal of the artist as author whose work purportedly exhibits the marks of their unique artistry. Such that the very positivistic identification of the artist as author leads to a cru- cial differentiation, one that represents the historical dialectic under which modern art and artists have long functioned: the former on the basis of originality, qua authenticity, of the work of art, and the latter on the authority and singularity of the artist as an individual talent and genius. To designate a work as the product of a collective practice in a world that privileges and worships individuality raises a number of vexing issues concerning the nature and practice of art and the status of the work that emerges from such collaboration, especially in networked versions of collectivity where a method of open work delays or defers any attempt to come to the conclusion of a work as a product. To the extent that the discourse of collectivity has been circumscribed by the above issues, debates on collective artistic formations and col- laborative practices tend to be much more unconcerned with the questions of \"Who is an artist?\"8 and \"What is an author?\"9 However, in certain segments of collective work that have recently emerged, there is a perva- sive sense of the loss of this critical distance. One may say that this critical loss of distance is at once by design, in which case it is a strategic move or simply a function of the broader loss of historical interest in the past. The current positive reception of such collective activity \u2014 much prevalent in positions that are more driven by pop cultural simulations; in fact, their very fashionability, may have something to do with the historical amnesia under which collectivity's recent revival operates. While collectivity portends a welcome expansion of the critical regimes of the current contemporary art context \u2014 which has been under the pernicious sway of money, the speculative art market, and 9 Okwui Enwezor152 conservative politics \u2014 in order to make common cause with its coun- terintuitive positionality, and therefore avoid participation in the co-option and appropriation of its criticality, it is important to connect collectivity today to its historical genealogy. This may mean going as far back as the Paris Commune of the 1860s, the socialist collectives of the Russian Revolution in the early 1920s, the subversive developments of Dada, the radical interventions of \"neo-avant-garde\" movements such as the Situationist International, and activist-based practices connected to issues of class, gender, and race. The nature of collectivity extends also into the political horizon constructed by the emanci patory projects of the liberation movements of the mid-twentieth century. They are registered today within the strategies of anti- globalisation movements. How do we then place the history of collectivity within the history of modernism? Nearly a century has passed since that fateful turning point in the epic march towards the redefinition of the concept of \"the work of art.\" Though we could all chuckle today in self-satisfied be musement and disinterest at the provincialism of the then British minister of culture Kim Howells's castigation of the work of four artists shortlisted for the Turner Prize for \"the poor quality of their work,\"10 which he reduced to nothing more than so much \"conceptual bullshit,\" in 1914 such bullshit was received as nothing short of heretic. Marcel Duchamp's insertion of the readymade into the discursive frame of art has acquired its own impressive inventory of epithets and dumbstruck admira- tion. In fact, its legacy has been called upon in the defence of so much more than the legitimacy of a number of discursive strategies that insist on the idea that they are works of art fashioned by the autonomous creative entity of \"the artist.\" Having profaned both the concept of art and artist in order to bring modernism back to a zero degree of its task of legitimation, Duchamp's readymade in a sense could be viewed as the founding philosophy of what is today designated as \"contemporary art.\" The genealogy of such strategies (which consistently attempt an improvement of our under - standing of the nature of the artistic object or statement) is fundamental to the historical discourse of modern art. It also furnishes the fundamental dialectic between modernist art and contemporary art, not least because the distinction between them remains at once porous and tendentious. Modernist art is said to have its roots in the myth of originality,11 in the idolatry of images and objects whose very physical existence was depend- ent on the reified nature of their objecthood. Or, if we speak specifically about images, we tend to relate to their iconicity and uniqueness on the basis of aura as one would religious images or objects.12 Moreover, modernist art was said to function with an internalised awareness of the hierarchy that structures the relationship between its constitutive parts, such as how the relationship between works of art came to be conceived as distinctions across genres, forms, and mediums (a heritage, no doubt, of classicism), evident, for example, in a line that separates \"fine\" and \"applied\" art or the relationship between mediums such as the one between painting and drawing. On the other hand, contem- porary art is understood to proceed from the evisceration of the idea 153of the authority of originality and the aura of the image. Rather, through its heterogeneity and the structure of simultaneity, it has overseen the remarkable dispersal of the legacy of modernism. One legacy of the expansion of the idea of contemporary art is the degree to which it abjures and has remained largely ambivalent to the dialectic of modernist art (between originality and aura), having taken aboard the idea that art is defined neither by its specific medium nor by the form through which it declares the very purpose of art, but rather simply by the context of art. Of course, the two models for this cultural turn in the understanding of art in the twentieth century remain cogent. The first being the radical termination of the idea of originality that Duchamp first inaugurated through his of painterly mod- ernism (\"retinal art,\" as he famously referred to it), which culminated in The Large Glass (1915-23). The implica- tions and consequences of Duchamp's intervention are already well known, even if they have developed their own cargo cult of epistemological re- ification, sedimentation, and certainty as art history. However, Duchamp's mutilation of the perceptive order in which the work of art is embedded is more than the transition between the meaning of an object, whether technologically fabricated, as many of his readymades were, or artistically fabricated, in which originality rests on the fact that the work is singular and not repeatable by any technology of standardisation. It is in the discur - sive domain of art's definition that Duchamp's proposition is considered to generate that moment when the history of contemporary art is said to begin. Similarly, Walter Benjamin's conclusions in his essay \"The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\" have been equally deployed as the watershed theory that defines the tension between modernist art and contemporary art, between the artistically fabricated object and the technologically generated image. If we take Duchamp's inter - vention and Benjamin's theory as the immediate ancestors for the proposition of what Thierry de Duve identifies in Duchamp's gesture as the shift from \"here is art\" to \"this is art,\"13 we would, nonetheless, still remain very much preoccupied with what the object of art as such is after the re-elaboration of its plasticity. There is, of course, a second horizon through which we can read some of the conclusions that, since the 1960s, have continuously questioned both the nature and status of the work of art. The struggle as such is not so much how does art generate its meanings through its many objects, forms, and mediums that can now be extended to activities or non-activities, be they technologically fabricated, digitally serialised, indexically structured, or programmatically schematised. Rather, it is: Can art now go beyond embed- ding itself in specific objects of mini- malism's phenomenological posture, or move to a truly radical position that is its complete reduction into nothing more than a linguistic description? The severe de-retinalisation that such a reduction proposes is part of the legacy of conceptual art, in which recourse to language carries the seed of Duchamp's original idea, except now the model of \"this is art if I say so\" has produced a moment of deep fecundation in which its social ramification has tended to open up the space of contemplation to that of 9 Okwui Enwezor154speech, or just simply the exchanges that inhere from a range of social rela- tions (this is fundamentally the place opened up by collectivity), thereby transporting the experience of art into sites of the multiple activities that today generate art as idea, discourse, activity, or whatever as an extended field of many types of transaction. Part of this synthesis or fusion of the contemplative and the linguistic, the formal and the social, at any rate led conceptual art to attempt also to abduct the traditional role of the historian and critic for its cause. Again, the work of Art & Language and such artists as Joseph Kosuth and Dan Graham is significant here. Concep- tual art was not simply content with destabilising the traditional categories within which art functioned, it also sought to inaugurate and propagate a philosophy for such destabilisa- tion as the basis for an ontology of advanced contemporary art. Kosuth especially made this part of his credo, as witnessed in his \"Art after Philosophy\" model.14 If contemporary art as inaugu- rated by Duchamp in his casual still lifes of quotidian objects refashioned as readymades in 1914 was already impatient with modernist claims of the uniqueness of vision, skilful finish, and such as the prerequisite for judging correctly what a work of art is, mod- ernist critics were no less dismissive of the claims of certain contemporary styles, seeing them as either fraud- ulent or ideologically compromised. From cubism onwards, and throughout the twentieth century, modernist art has had to grapple with the constant pluralisation of the concept of art and its forms and mediums (e.g., the cubist collage and film montage) and the hybridisation of the art object (e.g., the readymade and Dada). At every turn in the shift towards plurali- sation and hybridisation, modernist art has tried to prove its own staying power, and it is not devoid of its own spectacular weapons against the impudent assaults of Duchampian contemporary art, as witnessed in its attempt, every decade since the appearance of the first readymade, to storm the barricades and seize back the space of representation that painting and sculpture represent for classical art. In a sense, the historical debate between modernist art and contemporary art rests on a single philosophical tension, namely the issue of the authenticity of the work of art. For example, Benjamin observed that \"the revolutionary strength of Dadaism consisted in testing art for its authenticity.\"15 The issue of the authenticity of the work of art, and by extension that of the artist (who in a typical post- modernist term became the author), has a sociocultural basis beyond the art historical questions it generates, especially as the basis for conceptual art became more and more dissociat- ed from the polemics of statements about art to the politics of that state- ment and, finally, to the politics of rep- resentation. The legacy of Duchamp in the formulation of the theory of conceptual art produced consequenc- es beyond his original intent, to the extent that, at a certain juncture, Duchamp ceases to be a useful avatar for the range of heterogeneous strate- gies and statements that have devoted themselves as expressions of artistic intention outside the framework of objects and images. Benjamin Buchloh has rightly observed that in \"confronting the full range of the implications of Duchamp's legacy ... Conceptual practices ... reflected upon the construction and 155role (or death) of the author just as much as they redefined the conditions of receivership and the role of the spectator.\"16 Though Buchloh's state- ment is quite correct, in relation to the spectator the historians of conceptual art have not gone far enough in theo- rising the fundamental political nature of spectatorship. What I mean is that in the postwar transformation of the global public sphere, the traditional construction of the spectator within both Western and modernist under - standing experienced a radical rupture with the emergence of postcolonial discourse. Postcolonial and civil rights discourses put under the spotlight a new kind of spectator. This spectator would construct, during the postwar period, new subjective relations to institutions of Western democracy and economics. For example, in the United States, desegregated institutions needed also to rearticulate the philosophy informing their work as public spaces. The appearance of the subject within the framework of the experience of art was a new phenomenon which hitherto had been unacknowledged, insofar as the concept of the insti- tutions of art experienced pressures to be more attentive to the publics towards which it directed its under - takings. It was not just the primacy of the art object that demanded new consideration, but also the primacy of the social exclusions that purportedly were built into the way institutions of art mediated the history of those objects. The postwar democratic public sphere repositioned the specta- tor in ways that would only become much more clear with the emergence of certain politically centred inter - pretations of subjectivity \u2014 models of subjectivisation that were dependent on a number of socially bounded identifications (gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, etc.), of which multicultur - alism today functions as the dark spectre of the politics of the subject. While conceptualist paradigms may have opened a space for the con- siderations of some of these shifts, surprisingly the operation of concept- ualism still predicated itself on the hinge of the modernist dialectic of the object and the gaze. As such, the shift in the role of the traditional spectator within the structures of hegemonic institutions of power such as muse- ums and Western gallery systems was not substantially articulated in the operations of conceptual art. Already in 1952, a decade before conceptual art purportedly began the redefinition of the role of the spectator, Frantz Fanon had called this homogeneous spectator into question in his classic psychoanalytic study, Black Skin, White Masks. Fanon's study of subjectivity draws from the master-slave relation- ship of the self and other in colonial discourse, in which he foregrounds the importance of language whereby \"to speak is to absolutely exist for the oth- er.\"17 Therefore, the fact of conceptual art's interpellation of language into the field of artistic vision cannot simply be adopted, in toto, as the radical critique of language \u2014 for its own action of critique is called into question with re- gard to the self-sufficiency of its own language games. The Production of Social Space as Artwork: Protocols of Community in the Work of Le Groupe Amos and Huit Facettes So far I have focused on the historical and intellectual trajectory necessary for the understanding of collective practice within the field of contem- porary art. While artists across a 9 Okwui Enwezor156broad global arena have adopted this method with great creative and stimulating vigour, I will focus here on two key groups: Le Groupe Amos from Kinshasa, DR Congo, and Huit Facettes from Dakar, Senegal, that have emerged in Africa in the last two decades. My focus owes much to the fact that the two groups operate from within a specific cultural and historical context to which modern- ism and sometimes contemporary art have been antagonistic. If the dialectic between modernist and contemporary art has been caught in attempts at elucidating, within each field, what the authenticity of the work of art and artist (author) is, the un explored political consequences of this question take us now to the important question of identity formation, the politics and crisis of the subject, and the processes of homogenisation and assimilation of non-Western cultural sites into the framework of late capitalism. Because most non-Western artistic contexts lack power (in the neoliberal sense of market capitalism, in which modern and contemporary art objects func- tion), it is often easy to either dismiss their importance or ignore them as important contributors in the chang- ing discourse of art. The history of modernism in relation to African art is well known in this regard. Africa fulfils a role in which it could be absorbed as an astonishing example of a certain ethnographic turn towards which modernism's fascination with alterity has always tended. Or, in the very worst case, as embarrassing exam- ples of an impossible mimesis in the resemblance of modern African art to the \"superior\" Western paradigm. In this way, modern African art is treated as either exotic or strange, corrupted by colonial mimicry and devoid of authenticity. In whatever epistemological mode African art or artists are grounded, in the larger discussions of modernism or contemporary art it is first on the basis of a pure disavow- al, what the critic Hal Foster calls a \"process of dis-identification,\"18 that both African art and artists resemble the least what modern art is about. This is an old argument. Yet, another way this dis- identification occurs is through appropriation and assimilation of Africa as an effect of certain tropes of authenticity and cultural purity invested with the power of ethno- graphic realism. Most notably, for the African artist authenticity has become a congenital condition. Authenticity, because it partially hosts in its ambigu- ous carapace the kernel of the stereo- type, is a burden unsupportable by the practical, conceptual, and historical forms through which it is represented in contemporary cultural discourse. Authenticity, rather than affirming the continuities of a cultural past \u2014 based on a certain nineteenth-century \"West- ern romanticism\"19 as a general sig- nifier for an African tradition \u2014 in fact comes off more as the antithesis of such continuities. Thus, authenticity's primary structure is the fiction that reproduces it as the figure of a unitary, homogenous belief in the particular - ism of an African essence. Authenticity as an idea towards the standardization, hence banalisa- tion, of the complexity of contempo- rary African identity appeals to certain romantic notions of African unique- ness that have been promoted for so long. Authenticity therefore must be understood as the handmaiden of an ethnocentric discourse blind to the complexity of the modern map of African social reality, and doubly blind to the multiplicity of identities forged in the crucible of colonisation, globali-157sation, diaspora, and the postcolonial social transformation of insular cul- tural worlds. Authenticity is not only a vague notion with ambiguous features that no one can possibly identify, let alone describe its practicability in the context of African artistic procedures, but also a code for fixity, absolutism, atrophy. Writers such as Wole Soyinka and artists such as Issa Samb and the members of Laboratoire Agit'Art in Dakar were correct in questioning the efficacy of the ethnocentric model of N\u00e9gritude in the 1960s.20 In the same manner in which their critique of N\u00e9gritude as a universal of the African world functioned, so too did their rejection of the false claims of Euro- centric universalism over the territory of other cultures. To say this much is not to be beholden to the relativism that governs what passes today as cultural exchange, but to point to the difficulties that reproduce dichoto- mies that ground themselves in the discourse of power. In its attempt to arrest the African social imaginary, one could impute that the denotative idea behind the construct of authenticity is its primor - dialism, that is, as an a priori concept that determines and structures the bonds of the self to the other \u2014 the other as always unchanging, arrested, bound to tradition, tethered to the super natural forces of nature; the other whose social temporality is governed by an innate world and its systems of kinship, beliefs, and symbols, all of which remain beyond the reach of any structural or material transformation of reason and progress, except in superficial circumstances, after which the other returns back to an originary state. Therefore, au- thenticity as primordialism conceives of the other in a vacuum of history, locates them in the twilight of origin, fixed in the constancy of the un- changing same. Or, on the other hand, it conceives of the other as an excess and spectacle of history, as a cycle of repetition, mimicry, demonstration, performance, habitation, expression, and practice. This latter idea of authenticity as primordialism, in Michael Taussig's terms, could be called part of its mimetic faculties;21 that is, its ten- dency to quote, copy, and imitate that which is believed to be the original. So, in a paradoxical sense, the authen- tic is always false. According to such a logic, the mimetic faculty allows for the inexhaustible permutations of quoting, copying, and imitating an idea of African authenticity. For example, \"real Africa\" is traditional rather than modern; rural rather than urban; tribal and collective rather than individual and subjective; Black rather than hy- brid; timeless rather than contingent.22 With every process of affirmation and disavowal, we participate in the game of ceaseless mimeticism and repro- duction of the authentic. Taken to their most absurd level, these binarisms and conjectures take on a facticity and truth, which should then govern and aid all relations of production in art, literature, film, music, and other spheres of modern knowledge produc- tion. Yet in the same logic we witness the contingency of the destiny of the African artist in the face of various instruments of modern subjectivity, one of which concerns their liberation from the determinism of race. We may pause here to pay attention to the full emergence of a crisis: the crisis of the African subject.23 In the game of authenticity, the politics of the subject is an important one in relation to how this crisis is critically engaged. For the African subject, this crisis is paradoxi- cally engaged through the instrumen-9 Okwui Enwezor158tal rationalisation of the idea of free will. Achille Mbembe captures this succinctly. He writes: The triumph of the principle of free will (in the sense of the right to criticize and the right to accept as valid only what appears justified), as well as the individual's acquired capacity to self-refer, to block any attempt at absolutism and to achieve self-realization through art are seen as key attributes of modern consciousness.24 For those Africans who disavow the fiction of authenticity \u2014 the mimetic excess par excellence \u2014 what choice do they have beyond the violence of the dichotomy between the fake and real,25 authentic and inauthentic, primordialism (backwardness) and modernity (progress), the univer - sal and the particular? If we are to hypothesise authenticity what else could it mean beyond its interpretation as an act of constant self-repetition, self-mimicry, and self-abasement in the stew of origin? Shouldn't we begin the quest for the authentic in African cultural discourse first by ridding ourselves of all illusions that it can be conjured by a simple appeal to the past and tradition? Secondly, should we not be insisting that the most meaningful place to seek the figure of the authentic is not in the swamp of fantasies in which Africa has been caught as the true historical opposi- tion between reason and unreason, between the West and the rest, but elsewhere: in the very politics of the subject? The quest for the authentic, it seems to me, is in the search to locate the African subject, not simply as African (for that is already a given), but as a universal subject endowed with capacities far beyond the lure of authenticity. Such a subject is neither a mere fantasy of overdetermined cultural theory nor a fanciful post- modern caricature. Pace Mbembe, we can therefore present the case of the African subject in the following manner: The constitution of the African self as a reflexive subject ... involves doing, seeing, hearing, tasting, feeling, and touching. In the eyes of all involved in the production of that self and subject, these practices constitute what might be called meaningful human expressions. Thus the African subject is like any other human being: he or she engages in mean- ingful acts. ... The African subject does not exist apart from the acts that produce social reality, or apart from the process by which those practices are, so to speak, imbued with meaning.26 If the speech of the African subject is \"imbued with meaning\" at the moment they speak (whether as an artist or not), cultural subjectivity for the mod- ern African artist opposes itself to the binary violence of either/or, univer - salism/particularism. The complexity of such a speech extrudes from the dynamism of multiple traditions and is transformed in the aleatory patterns of juxtaposition, mixing, and creolisa- tions that define the contact zone of culture, especially after colonialism. As I have tried to show above, the discourse of crisis27 is not only endemic to the political and social for - mation in Africa, but it also concerns the crisis evident in the processes of subjectivisation, by which I mean not just the ability to constitute a 159speech not marked by the failure of intelligibility and communicability but the very act of creative transformation of African reality. Thus the process of subjectivisation is the ability for a given subject to articulate an auton- omous position, to acquire the tools and power of speech (be it in art, writ- ing, or other expressive and reflexive actions), and it is connected to the idea of sovereignty. This sovereignty operates around the ethical-juridical territory of power relations, namely between the recognition of the given fact of natural rights and that right regulated and legitimised by the law. Here, the individual is \"subjectified in a power relationship.\"28 The idea of the \"sovereign subject\" as it concerns Africa is impor - tant if we are to rethink questions of authenticity in cultural practice. I want to do so by turning to the position of the artist as producer in times of crisis.29 This crisis points first to the crisis of the postcolonial state,30 and to the general climate of uncertainty unleashed by globalisation. For Africa in particular, there is also the crisis of development discourse that has been the bedrock of the democratisation and liberalisation of the postcolonial state and economies since the 1960s. Here it is important to note that the postcolonial state has been exacer - bated in the last two decades by the brutal macroeconomic structural adjustment programs (SAPs) of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the 1980s and 1990s. Though there are disputes among experts about the actual causes of the kind of congenital underdevelopment we see in Africa today, it is generally agreed that SAPs deepened it and weakened the capacity of the state to manage and respond effectively to its effects. SAPs put into place the inability of a host of African subjects to properly conceptualise and formulate their own futures; that is, to speak as true social subjects. All throughout Africa, institutions and citizens are vulnera- ble to the rapacious calumny of the industrial forces of economic rational- isation and political coercion. Rather than reform and economic growth as promised, the shock of the experiment at liberalisation produced stagnation, structural atrophy, collapsed econo- mies, deep poverty, failed institutions, and the loss of state autonomy from donor institutions and markets. Liberal reform of the economy (devaluation of currencies, imposition of austerity measures, privatisation of state assets) set in motion a deepening crisis, leading to further underdevelopment and dependency across institutions. Of these, cultural and educational institutions were the most vulnerable. Consequently, artists and intellectu- als were placed on very precarious ground in society. Only recently have liberal economists, the World Bank, and the IMF begun to acknowledge the failure of the economic shock therapies31 that have affected insti- tutions across the continent. As a test case, the neoliberal ideology of free-market capitalism not only failed in Africa but also produced a wave of disenchantment, instability, and erosion of social networks. If, as Michel Foucault claims, \"the theory of sovereignty assumes from the outset the existence of a multiplicity of powers ...[imagined as] capacities, possibilities, potentials,\"32 then the grim assessment of the postcolonial state and the postcolonial subject within the developmental discourse of neoliberal market ide- ology introduces a series of illiberal effects. But here we need to fashion 9 Okwui Enwezor160a proper critique of crisis as not always the logical outcome of the neoliberal transformation of the modern African state. Yet, its effects cannot be discounted, especially when the state fails, as we can witness in the context of what is known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Seen from this example, crisis not only situates the subject, it mortifies the subject. The chief and primary effect of this is traumatic. This trauma compels a complete rethink- ing, if not necessarily the overhaul, of the forms, strategies, and techniques of everyday existence as well as the devices through which cultural pro- duction occurs and the places where it is grounded. Because this crisis affects the effectiveness of institu- tions, conditions of production, and the visibility and quality of discursive formations, the position of the artist and intellectual within the African public sphere is constantly called into question. Further more, the coercive power of the state to force artists and intellectuals to adapt their practices according to an official dictum of the state apparatus forces attempts at disclosing the autonomy of the artist and intellectual under such force.33 Many intellectuals, researchers, and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) working in the area of African political and cultural sectors in recent years have focused on different strategies of strengthening civil society, governance, democracy, and informal economies as a way of boosting the sovereignty of the subject in times of crisis. This has given rise to a number of responses. Though much of the focus has been concentrated on the work of NGOs, community associa- tions, social-science think tanks, and multilateral global institutions, very little attention has been given to the dimension of culture. I do so here by examining the work of two distinctly different collective groups of practi- tioners who have made the analysis of the conditions of production under this crisis the sine qua non of their reflexive activities since 1989 and 1996, respectively. The two groups, Le Groupe Amos in Kinshasa and Huit Facettes in Dakar, were both formed as specific responses to: (a) the crisis of the public sphere under the long dictatorship of Mobutu Sese Seko in the former Zaire and the country's further deterioration under the late Laurent Kabila, who overthrew the Mobutu regime in 1997; (b) the erosion of the link between the state and formal institutions of culture; (c) the collapse and disappearance of the public sphere; and (d) the crisis and alienation of the labour of the artist working within the forced bifurcation of social space between the urban and rural contexts of Senegal. These responses, the first in DR Congo (formerly Zaire) and the other in Senegal, are positions specifically articulated towards the production of a common social space and the development of protocols of community as the first condition for the recognition of the sovereign subject. It is by this insight that we can situate the work of Le Groupe Amos and Huit Facettes, especially in light of their direct engagement with the politics of crisis in African social, political, and cultural discourse in order to produce new networks that link them to local communities. Each, in its conception of the social and community, calls for evaluative procedures in the construction of a reflexive practice within their given context.161 Le Groupe Amos was founded in 1989 by a group of writers, intellec- tuals, activists, and artists in Kinshasa. It emerged out of the political and economic crisis of the last decade of Mobutu's corrupt, dictatorial misrule, as Congolese civil society began a process of realignment and finally disintegrated into civil war. Taking its name from the biblical prophet Amos, who in the Old Testament is identified with the struggle for social justice, Le Groupe Amos initiated a grassroots activist movement that uses classic means of social aesthet- ics to communicate its work to the community at large. The collective evolved in the context of the changing realities in Zaire during the Mobutu regime and afterwards under the autocratic government of Kabila in DR Congo. The activities and work of the group take up methods of cultural activism that can be best seen as an extension of the tactics found in Latin American liberation theology, infusing their activism with the ethics of civil disobedience and \"creative non- violent action.\"34 As a collective, one of its principal quests was how to deal with the crisis of legitimation facing millions of disempowered Congolese silenced by the venality of two brutal regimes. In a way, there was an idealism sur - rounding this quest, especially when it concerns the choice to offer a dif- ferent critical option to the Congolese public beyond the armed rebellion being waged against Mobutu and Kabila, in order to free the subjective force of their repressed society by means of direct action. Four points are important in the work and conception of Le Groupe Amos. The first is its identification with the political, social, and cultural aspi- rations of the ordinary Congolese. This means that all its work are produced to intervene directly in the sphere of political and social formations seeking to affect their reality. These inter - ventions often take a didactic format and are produced both in French \u2014 the official lingua franca of the state \u2014 and in the vernacular, Lingala, the language of everyday discourse among ordinary people in Kinshasa. The second aspect of the group is its relationship to the sphere of insti- tutional power, not only that repre- sented by the state but also that of the church, in this case the Catholic Church. Here, the group foregrounds a critical, discursive activist relationship to the res publica in the conception and organisation of its projects. To do so, it translates its intellectual ideals into a series of programmatic activities (via theatre, art instruction, pamphleteering, sexual education, etc.), broadening its network among neighbourhood associations in order to organise and harness those aspirations operative in the field of power. Thirdly, the field of its actions and techniques of dissemination, production, and media (often accessi- ble and direct, such as play using the organisation of power in a family unit to explore the underlying pro- duction of inequity within democratic systems) are carefully fused, whereby as part of the social production of the public sphere, the site of reception is also constituted as a democratic civil forum. And, fourthly, it defines its relationship to the public sphere in the manner that Antonio Gramsci defines the role of the intellectual in the context of culture. For Le Groupe Amos, this is principally formulated on the ethics of self-governance. Here the work of the intellectual is both in the activity of particular forms of praxis and in the functions that require a certain minimum intellectual 9 Okwui Enwezor162dis pensation \"within the general complex of social relations.\"35 In the field of social relations in which Le Groupe Amos has positioned its work, the targets of its actions are the state and those institutions and organisations: the church (especially the Catholic Church), political parties, rebel movements, and multinational global institutions linked to powerful economic interests. These groupings are generally regarded as complicit in suppressing the subjectivity of the Congolese people. Working with a variety of grass- roots organisations, Le Groupe Amos employs a number of devices, such as pedagogy for its projects on literacy and non-violence. With regard to politics, it uses public interventions in various media to transmit its message within the urban neighbourhoods of Kinshasa and more broadly beyond the immediate locus of the city. These interventions manifest themselves as forms of direct action targeting specific deficits within the political, social, and cultural economies. The actions can be in the form of a theat- rical production organised with local actors (housewives, workers, young students), while other activities involve didactic teaching material, essays, commentaries, and cartoons published in newspapers, pamphlets, posters, and magazines. Along with these, it publishes books, teaches clinics, and organises workshops on democracy and democratisation, governance and citizenship, tolerance, civil dis- obedience, and gender equality. The group also produces radio broadcasts, theatre, and audio and short video documentaries, taking advantage of the endless reproducibility of the me- dia as a way to reach communities in other parts of the vast country. Since there is no gallery system to speak of whatsoever in Kinshasa, where Le Groupe Amos is based, this form of direct intervention into public discourse is unique and in many ways novel within its context. It is impor - tant to note that the concept of art to which the group adheres is broader than the narrowly defined aesthetic sense of art. For Le Group Amos, the tools of art are a means rather than ends in themselves. Questions raised, positions taken, debate engaged in are of greater significance than final outcomes. The work, then, is part of longer, durational process of accul- turation and procedural inscription. One could rightly say that there is a proselytising dimension in the way the group employs dominant media strategies to reach a wide variety of publics in its work. The effective- ness of its practices and the level of critical respect it has received could be observed in the most recent work it is involved in, which focuses on reconciliation among the warring factions of different Congolese rebel movements. In this capacity, the mem- bers of Le Group Amos were invited as participant-observers, as one of the privileged forums of Congolese civil society, to the peace conference on the Congolese civil war hosted by the South African government in 2002 in Sun City, South Africa. Previously, I pointed out the degree to which language plays a formidable role in the activities of the group. With a large segment of the population being illiterate, Le Groupe Amos is aware that, for its work to have a direct consequence within the field into which it intervenes, it needs to be conscious of the language of its discourse. In this case, its work maintains a critical awareness of the social and class divisions perpetuated through the mastery of the colonial 163language. Its tactic is not to disavow French, which is the language of official discourse, but rather to em- power the vernacular languages (e.g., Lingala, Swahili) as tools of popular discourse. In so doing, the group seeks to decapitate the class distinctions between those who occupy the space of power, and therefore are perceived as possessing discursive authority, and those on the margins of power, who lack a voice. Of the latter class, women are the most vulnerable to the distor - tion of the power relationships that define the chaotic and impoverished character of the Congolese public sphere. Thierry N'Landu, a professor of American literature at the University of Kinshasa and founding member of the group, describes some of their projects: Groupe Amos's commitment to changing Congolese society through nonviolent strategies is evidenced by numerous inspira- tional and informative projects. In particular, Amos has focused on the plight of women in short video documentaries such Congo aux Et ta violence me scul ta Femme (\"Your Violence Made me a Woman\"), 1997, is a video in Lingala, a vernacular language from Kinshasa, which celebrates the power of Congolese women who struggle for rights in a context where traditions, customs, religion, and even existing laws do not facilitate equality.36 Two things are noteworthy in N'Landu's statement. The first concerns the form through which Le Groupe Amos undertakes its work as a sociocultural activity rather than specifically as a visual art activity. This would lead one to see the group's work in the broader context of knowl- edge production rather than in that of artistic or visual production. The effectiveness of direct communication to its audiences leads the group to pursue its work through the discur - sive utility of linguistic identification with each of its specific and general audiences. The second point concerns the relationship of power to the social reproduction of agency and sovereign- ty, particularly with regard to women. Here, specific critiques of the patriar - chal structure of Congolese society are directed at the customs, traditions, and existing laws that place women in subservient positions of power. Again, the serviceability of the figure of the authentic has a far more limited purchase than the idea of the subject, insofar as the status of women is concerned in the Congolese context. This, again, is articulated as one of the stated intentions of the role of citizenship and authorship in the development of new forms of social discourse of civil society in DR Congo. Jos\u00e9 Mpundu, another member of Le Groupe Amos, in an essay on the future of democracy in DR Congo, writes: Civil society in the situation of this crisis and in view of the resolution of the conflict will have to reconnect with its primary vocation: to educate the people in order for them to be able to take charge of themselves on all levels. Civic, political as well as moral education will make of our people the authors of their history and the masters of their destiny. Civil society is asked to play a 9 Okwui Enwezor164role of primary importance in the process of liberation of the people. ... Political liberation, economic liberation, cultural liberation, social liberation: that is the true struggle of civil society. In order to do so, it will have to help the people organize in an efficient manner and to elaborate strategies of social struggle.37 Having elaborated this quasi-Marxist view of class struggle, Mpundu, a few sentences later, makes clear the idea that the liberation imagined by Le Groupe Amos is a liberation not just from the despotism of the state and its rulers (including the surrogates of Rwanda and Uganda who occupy the eastern part of the country) but also from the hegemonic power identified with European and American inter - ests. Throughout the discourse of the crisis in Africa, the identification of the mendacity of forces of production with external powers has become deeply entrenched and not without foundation. These forces, in the name of a number of abstract concepts connected to the great liberal trinity of democracy, the free market, and human rights. are often believed to be a kind of third force that has to be fought before the sovereign African subject can emerge. Huit Facettes was formed by a group of eight artists \u2014 hence its name \u2014 in 1996, in Dakar. It is differ - ent from Le Groupe Amos in that it is self-identified as an artist collec- tive, using the means of art and its corollary, creativity, to probe the relationship between the aesthetic and the ethical, the social and cultural. However, the task Huit Facettes set out for itself was first a confrontation with the impotency, immobility, and disempowerment the artists in the collective perceived in the artistic context of Senegal. The second question that concerned members of Huit Facettes was the increasing social stratification that defined the relation- ship between the elite and the poor in the city \u2014 a stratification that also had impoverished the relationship of their individual work to the society in which it was produced, leading it inexorably towards becoming a code for its own alienation. This stratifi- cation and alienation is even more acute in the lines that separate rural and urban communities in Senegal. In the city, the terms of dwelling and perceptions of social agency are often aleatory. While the urban economy is governed by a tendency towards informality and improvisation within the capitalist economy, the rural community is entirely tethered to a pre- industrial agrarian past. In the city, social networks that bind one community to another have not only exploded, producing scattered trajectories, but have also become im placable, diffuse, and difficult to organise. The urban material consist- ency, having succumbed to obso- lescence, is now shaped by growing spatial distortions that collapse into fleeting temporalities. On the vast outskirts of the urban rim, forgotten communities in the villages that are the historical link between the past and the present, the local and global, live on the edge of official amnesia; on the dark side of a politics of invisibility. Though massive in population and visible through the meagre, deraci- nated social amenities that can barely cope with their demands, the poor in Africa have become the disappeared of globalisation. In broad daylight, Africans are short-circuited between 165development and underdevelopment, between the Third World and the First World. The poor are invisible because official discourse long ago stopped seeing them. Instead, they have become a blind spot in the neoliberal catechism of the move towards the market economy. They have become ghosts in the political machine39 of late modernity. Deracinated by structural adjustment policies, the rural and urban contexts in Africa have become manifestations that produce their own structure of fecundation, a fertile soil for new possibilities of being. Urban and rural inhabitants have increasingly begun working with new kinds of experimentation, contra the logic of development modernity. They are involved in inventing new subjective identities and protocols of community. All these issues coalesce in the activities of Huit Facettes. Its principal project since its formation is the Hamdallaye Project, a long, extended collaboration with the in- habitants of the village of Hamdallaye, some five hundred kilometres from Dakar, in the Haute Casamance region near the Gambian border. Huit Facettes perceives its work exactly as the inverse of the logic of devel- opment strategies through the utility of art. In so doing, its central mission has been to \"disentangle modernism's historical contradiction between art's claim to aesthetic autonomy and its ambitions for social relevance.\"40 The sustained ongoing project at Hamdallaye attempts, through collab- oration between the members of the group and the villagers, to concentrate not only on the circulation of the symbolic goods of artistic skills but also on the strategic transfer of vital skills from the artists to the village community. However, this transfer of skills is directed to ensure that the villagers retain creative control of their artistic labour. To empower the isolat- ed villagers, and thereby increase their economic capacity through artistic skills, not only profits the villagers, but it also helps them bridge the social distance between themselves as artists and the villagers who perceive artists from the point of view of being a privileged urban elite identified with elements of the state. According to Kan-Si, one of the founding members: Huit Facettes in rural Senegal is much more the story of a procedure or process which, as it unfolds, has given us (contemporary Senegalese artists living in the city) a point of anchorage or reconciliation with the part of society that feeds us and from which we were cut off. One particular elite rejoins its roots in the same sociocultural ( Senegalese) context.41 Each year in Hamdallaye since 1996, the project with the villagers begins with a series of public discussions that then move into the phase of work- shops. Each workshop is designed to transform basic skills into professional skills, for example in under-glass paint- ing, ceramics, batik dyeing, carving, weaving, embroidery. Depending of the level of work needed to accomplish the training at hand, the workshops are normally conducted over a period of one to two weeks. The concentra- tion on specific kinds of skills is arrived at based on both their utility and their creativity. But also on dialogue with members of the community. Women are especially targeted as a group who can profit from the link with the artists. 9 Okwui Enwezor166For Huit Facettes, the arrival at what to do in each workshop is connect- ed to the utility of certain creative systems (they have to be accessible, inexpensive, skilful, sustainable over a long period, and draw from the exchange of knowledge between the two groups). What the artists offer, in addition, is access to material, ad- vertisement of the results and access to the urban market. Above all, the autonomy of the Hamdallaye residents in deciding what is most useful for them in the collaboration is im portant for the critical discourse of Huit Facettes. The group tries to avoid the hierarchical structure of NGO develop- ment work. This is partly to stimulate the agency and subjective capacity of each participant in the workshop, to help them establish an individual expression. But above all it is to avoid at all costs the possibility of depend- ency. By paying critical attention to the idea of subjectivity, Huit Facettes works in the interstices of develop- ment and empowerment, whereby \"in the end the participants are able to set up self-sustaining practices as non- dependent citizens.\"42 This approach is attempted as a subtle contradiction of the de- velopment discourse, which recently has been the dominant vehicle for addressing many African crises. The top-down, donor-client model of NGOs and development agencies based in wealthy Western countries have been perceived as undermining Africa's ability to be non-dependent. Often- times, development organisations, through donor institutions, operate on the assumption of economic and sociopolitical templates that can be domesticated within an African context \u2014 transforming the templates, as it were, into substrates of an authentically African ideal. As such, there is a preponderance of support for an aesthetic of recycling, the make-do, makeshift, and bricolage, rather than invention, sophistication, and the technologically sound transfer of knowledge.43 In short, development has given rise to the spectacle and excess of Tokunbo culture,44 whereby discarded and semifunctional techno- logical objects and detritus of the West are recalibrated for the African market. From used cars to electronics, from biotechnology to hazardous waste, Africa has become the dumping and testing ground for both extinct Western technologies and the West's waste.45 All these issues come up in Huit Facettes' analysis of the political- social- cultural economy of Senegal. On a certain level, this approach may in certain quarters be perceived as naive. However, Huit Facettes is under no illusion that its work makes any difference beyond its ability to establish a particular type of social context for communication between itself and different communities in Senegal. One example is its work on health, particularly the campaign to raise public awareness on the AIDS pandemic, for which the work it produced included a hip-hop concert on the subject. Different members of the group were also involved as participants, as individual artists, in the multidisciplinary urban renewal project called Set Setal during the early 1990s in Dakar. The conception of art on the basis of activism is one on which its statements have been soundly equivocal. There is no over - determined claim for the emancipatory capacity of art. Like Le Groupe Amos's, art of the kind that Huit Facettes proposes in the name of actualising a community is a means in the process of coming together in a discursive as 167well as a cultural recognition, rather than an end towards consecration of artistic talent alone. According to Kan-Si, in the view of Huit Facettes: Artistic work that aspires to engage with social issues ... contributes in one way or another to the development of the \"real world,\" only much will depend on the nature of that work. Such contribution will have to be perceived differently and in a wider sense, just as the notion of a work of art can be under stood more in terms of process than as finished cultural object, to be instantly consumed (seen, appreciated or indeed judged). Society's concerns become the medium for an intervention, if only suggestively, for a formula through which we may engage with and seek solutions to problems encountered in everyday life.46 This statement demonstrates the group's inclination to treat sceptically any notion that art of the kind it is involved in ought to supply surplus value as cultural products that can be consumed, collected, and classified. By forcing themselves to confront the incommensurable in the relationship between the ethical and the aesthetic, between the subject and the state, Huit Facettes and Le Groupe Amos operate in the vanguard position of a new type of debate within the contemporary African public sphere. As we know, all activities, events, and practices of art are grounded in specific para- digm formations; that is, all activities, events, and practices of art are de termined by a history and the structure of the formation of that history. It is also important not to analyse the complex manifestation of this practice from the perspective of an aesthetics of political action, which, today, is not only problematic but has increased the dialectical tension between notions of ethics and aesthetics. Whether it is possible to address ethical questions through the vehicle of aesthetics seems, for now, not only overdetermined but also subject to deep ideological appropriation by both liberal and conservative forces. In fact, the combination of the political and the poetic, the aesthetic and the ethical, have often led to an unhappy con- flation of power and morality. Consequently, the conjunction of ethics and aesthetics in certain forms of institutional critique have tended to view artistic practice through the lens of a simplistic analy- sis of politics (between good and bad, proper and improper, virtuous and cynical), rather than through the more critical notion of the political, which, to my mind, grounds all relations of power and discourses between artists, activists, and institutions. Ethics today has a high currency in the field of contemporary art, all the more so because of the kinds of surprising prohibition placed on the political in relation to art.47 Contemporary discourses in many areas \u2014 be it in the conduct of war (the adherence to or violation of the Geneva Conventions); medicine (euthanasia and abortion being two examples); biotechnology (the recent debates around the ethics of cloning); law (capital punishment); or human rights (child labour, slavery, racism \u2014 have engaged further explorations of the ethical as that which sutures 9 Okwui Enwezor168certain complex conducts into the political, scientific, and cultural spheres. And here artists have been at the forefront of an interdisciplinary response to the debates that have grown out of them. However, the relations between the ethical and the aesthetic, the aesthetic and the political, and the poetic and the social have increasingly brought the philosophical discourse and moral force of ethics before us in an un- resolved form. This is where I believe the discourse of \"authenticity,\" as the force that gives positive content to the work of the African artist, is not only misguided but deeply proble- matic. Therefore, to understand that which animates the world view of the African artist, we must do well to invent a new politics of the subject. 1 Walter Benjamin, \"The Author as Producer, \" in Reflections: Essays, Aphorisms, Autobiographical Writings, ed.

In the case of Shonibare, he has used the idea of excess as a strategy to undercut the power of the authentic as a marker of cheapness and lack of sophistication. 23 See Achille Mbembe and Janet Roitman, \"Figures of the Subject in Times of Crisis, \" Public Culture 7 , no. 2, (1995): 323 - 52. 24 Achille Mbembe, On the Postcolony (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2001), 10. 25 Sydney Kasfir has made the important observation of the fact that questions of authenticity of African art were first a value of connoisseurship of the Western collector, for whom the importance of authenticity depended on the establishment of what is valued as fake and what is not valued as a copy or a fake. Therefore, the science of authentication is not more than a fantasy of projection through the construction of \"tribal style, \" whereby \"authenticity as an ideology of collection and display creates an aura of cultural truth around certain types of African art (mainly precolonial and sculptural). \" Kasfir, \" African Art and Authenticity: A T ext with a Shadow, \" 98. 26 Mbembe, On the Postcolony, 6.

Under the threat of the looming political crisis in Europe at the dawn of fascism, Benjamin averred that the context of production\u2014here he was speaking specifically about literature\u2014must be set in a \"living social context\" namely the social context of produc- tion. Conversely he observed that \"social conditions are ... determined by conditions of production. And when a work was criticized from a materialist point of view, it was customary to ask how this work stood vis-a-vis the social relations of production of its time. \" The second point made by Benjamin in this direction is: \"Rather than asking, 'what is the attitude of a work to the relations of production of its time?' I would like to ask 'What is its position in them?' This question directly con- cerns the function the work has within the literary [artistic] relations of production of its time\" (original emphases).

When artists and intellectuals are forced to go to exile, many experience an anxiety of the authenticity of their work. 34 Thierry N'Landu, \"Le Groupe Amos\" Reader: Selected Writings, 1916 -1935, ed.

Hazoume\u00e9's plastic masks fashioned out of cutout plastic jerry cans, on the other hand, reside uneasily between genuine sculptural experiments and Afro-kitsch. The larger and more critical question is why has the bricolage aesthetic persisted for so long all across Africa, and in fact seem to be acquiring an even greater acceptance in the work of even younger artists? The upshot is that, for some reason, recycling as an aesthetic option strangely continues to be seen by many artists as a proper artistic choice for making art. This, perhaps, is owed to the erroneous notion that using recycled, impoverished material in clever ways somehow transform and elevates the assembled oddities into innovative, albeit uncanny, artistic products that raise local curiosity and please benevolent development workers. 44 T okunbo is a Y oruba term that literally means \"second child, \" but in the typical wry humor that accompanies responses to bleak socio economic conditions in most African countries, the term has come to stand for the vast second-hand market of Western tech- nological products such as cars, computers, electronics, and assorted machines that have been reconditioned and made suitable for export to Africa. The scale of the T okunbo trade far outstrips that in new technological products and increasingly has come under state scrutiny for the effects on the environment, productivity, and safety. 45 In fact, it seems unimaginable that there could be any other reason for this response to second-hand, recycled commodity- fetish products of the developed world beyond the survivalist strategies of people caught in the grips of brutal global economic restructuring. It is also to such survivalist strategies that artists and intellectuals have turned in order to protect their autonomy as critical producers of culture. 46 Kan-Si, \"Dimensions Variable, \" 122. 47 A number of the critiques that accompanied the reception of Documenta11, which devoted a significant part of the exhibition to exploring the relationship between representation and the domain of social life, were based on abjuring the political and ethical in the conception of the work of art. T ypical of such responses were criticisms from neoconservative writers such as Michael Kimmelman of the New Y ork Times, Blake Gopnik of the Washington Post, and Christopher Knight of the Los Angeles Times.9 Okwui Enwezor173First I'd like to especially say, thank you for being asked to take part in the anniversary celebration of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. I can state that I would not be the artist I am without the environment for thinking that the Academy, with its excellent teachers and staff, has built up. My contribution to the celebration comes in the form of a text titled \"Kasbah Walking III, Taking Photographs and Making Embroidery.\" The text was previously published in the catalogue for the project World Wide Weaving \u2014 Atlas: Weaving Globally, Metaphorically and Locally, conceived and curated by Dorothee Albrecht and I in 2017, and published by KHiO \u2014 Oslo National Academy of the Arts.Kasbah Walking III, Taking Photographs and Making Embroidery Hans Hamid Rasmussen201710 Hans Hamid Rasmussen174 The title of this essay came about as a result of a letter from Sarat Maharaj, Professor in Visual Art and Knowledge Systems at the Academy, with advice and help in understanding important critical issues related to my research project. He asked me: Did I understand that, among other things, relation itself represents a potentiality of real space? In my role as a professor in the Art and Craft department at KHiO, from 2008 to 2020, I have tried to bring in the learning culture that was first conveyed to me by Malm\u00f6 Art Academy Rector Gertrud Sandqvist more than two decades ago. The project World Wide Weaving was developed together with Dorothee Albrecht for textile students at KHiO, and it included important contributions from both Maharaj and Sandqvist and much inspiration from the learning culture that makes Malm\u00f6 Art Academy such an important institution. Kasbah Walking III, Taking Photographs and Making Embroidery During the past years, Europeans have intensively dealt with issues related to refugees and immi- gration, due to the wars in both Afghanistan and Syria. But there are also people seeking safety and better living conditions who are from else- where in Africa and are arriving in Europe with transit through Libya, Algeria, and Morocco. I will not go into this large topic, with the ex- ception of mentioning that my family also once arrived in Europe as refugees, fleeing from a coup d'\u00e9tat in Algeria in 1965. We rested in Budapest for one year. Then we moved on to Norway, while my father made his way to Paris. For my sister and me, the flight was easier because our mother is Norwegian. This happened in the late 1960s, early 1970s. During that time, Scandinavia was still in a mode of openness. To be more specific, 175the farmer's area where I grew up was a rather friendly and peaceful place to arrive at. Still, like most strangers, I have experienced what it means to be alienated both geographically and socially. Even after living in Norway for many years, I still experience and keep within me the knowledge of what is different. The philosopher Paul Ricur states that, on the one side, what we forget and what we remember is a result of an active cognitive process. But what becomes history and what we share with others results from a shared critical process, which then slowly develops into what becomes a collective memory. Shared memories are constructed in close relation to geography \u2014 places in landscape and cities, the names we give places \u2014 and also immaterial shared knowledge, such as myths and fairy tales. During my second trip to Algiers in 2007, together with my brother Karim and my father Boualem Makouf, I met relatives living in the Kasbah. A \"kasbah\" is etymologically understood as a fortress. The form of the street and colours used on the facades are meant to cause dis- orientation. Any enemies had to split up into thinner lines or smaller groups, which then were easier to attack. The French used to call the Kasbah in Algiers la ville blanche. In the film La Bataille d'Alger from 1966, we learn how the French Army developed new systematic methods to penetrate resistance movements such as the FLN. As a matter of fact, with tremendous force \u2014 napalm and electrical torture and the systematic re- pression of civil people \u2014 the oppressor could penetrate a resistant social body living in the country as well as in the complex city structure of the Kasbah. When I took walks in the Kasbah, I was aware of this history and reflected on it. This history 10 Hans Hamid Rasmussen176was passed over from my father and is entangled into family matters. He told me: \"When I was tortured by the French, it was bearable because I knew the earth under me was of my own. It gave me the strength to endure. in prison after the coup, when my own people tortured me, it was as if the earth disappeared.\" Boualem Makoufs commitment to establish- ing an international socialism based on Marxism could not find a future in a state like the one Algeria had become. He went into exile to Paris, where he became politically active, in close relation to art in many forms. In the Kasbah, the shifting social conditions have also formed the city. The steps we walk up and down respond to shifting political and social circumstances. I write \"we,\" because there are so many people who carry with them past experiences of violence. Well after moving or fleeing to new social and geographical conditions, a large gap exists between an inner memory, or a memory we share with a few, and a collective memory. Memories can be contained in the smell of a flower or in the sight of a familiar bird and the songs it sings. But more important for our living conditions is how we are able to trans- port and translate our memories from past into present situations. When walking in the Kasbah, I feel connected to historical time, to periods of long duration like the time of French colonial- ism, to air strikes and bombings and the National Liberation Front's (FLN) response to this. I feel the repercussions of the civil war at the end of 1990s, but also of earthquakes that caused damage to buildings and street structures. In a strange way, the present city structure reflects the past of many Algerians. I believe refugees around the world have similar experiences. Walking in the Kasbah weaves together the past and the present, as well as interlinked geographical references.177Image pp. 178 -179: Kasbah, November 11, 2009.

Durmusoglu 2019 This text is an amended version of an essay that accom\u00ad panied Runo Lagomarsino's exhibition We are each other's air at gallery Francesca Minini, Milan, in July 2019. \"We need other kinds of stories, \" says Donna Haraway as she faces the camera in Fabrizio Terranova's Storytelling for Earthly Survival (2016) and then suggests a wide horizon of possibilities about how these other stories may feel, look, or sound like. To balance our earthly living, weak stories are to be rendered strong while dominant stories are to be rendered weak. Runo Lagomarsino's practice is woven around a strong need for other kinds of stories shaped by persisting presence in the face of dominant narratives of power. From the beginning of our conversation, I followed how this desire unfolds itself in different forms and processes. And our conversation began at a critical turning point, when Runo was finishing his Master of Fine Art at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and when I was starting a new journey as part of the school's Critical Studies postgraduate programme, led by Simon Sheikh. It has been almost fifteen years since, and we continue to converse and collaborate thanks to the formal and political issues we both care about \u2014 ways to create other kinds of stories and circulate them. 11 Reprinted by permission of the author and Runo Lagomarsino.

Durmusoglu182 Runo is very aware of how language is a site of empowerment and a site of enslavement at the same time. In his approach, materialities become tools and environments of storytelling; they are transformed with frictions such as the dilemma of presence and the impossibility of containment. He has recently been experimenting more with con- tainment in various forms and elements, collapsing the boundaries between materiality and immateriality in different realms of politics and poetics. The Enlightenment, defined as the Age of Reason in Europe, advo cated ideals such as liberty, progress, tolerance, constitutional government, and the separation of church and state, and it produced the basis of modernity as it is understood today. For the artist, modernity and its ideals, as erected through the domination of labour, wealth, and resources appropriated from colonised lands and communities, reduces the knowledge and reality of the worlds we live in to a singular dominant narrative. The sharp and idiosyncratic sense of humour cross-referencing double-faced stories of modernity has acquired even more responsibility these days, when we are acutely experiencing the collapse of modernity \u2014 a multifaceted hegemonic project that we are all part of in different ways. Runo often fractures and plays with the historical narrative of enlightenment, which appears in the materiality and symbolism of both natural and artificial light in works such as Trans-Atlantic (2010 - 11), for which he had newspapers regularly exposed to sun during transatlantic sea travel; Stolen Light (Abstracto en Dorado) (2013), a display of stolen light bulbs and neons he took from the Ethnological Museum in Berlin; and A Place in Things (2014), in which he reunites more than one hundred lighting devices previously used in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, systematically laid out on a plinth. Communities today resist the further stealing of light, the further extraction of resources from south to north, the narratives erasing the effects of centuries-long extraction. One such example of resistance is taking place very close to the Museum Island of Berlin, specifically around the newly constructed Humboldt Forum, which incorporates the same Ethnological Museum that Runo worked around, with its collections from Africa, Asia, the Americas, and Oceania, as well as the Museum of Asian Art. Rather than working to address the violent histories behind these collections, the Humboldt Forum project is moving in the exact opposite direction: to house these objects, it has revived a fifteenth-century palace charged with the symbolism of the Prussian monarchy, Christian dominance, and colonial entitlement. The Coalition of Cultural Workers Against the Humboldt Forum is addressing this proposal in the centre of the city, which is outrageous at a time when monuments to racist, colonial violence are being removed in very visible ways around the world.183 Poet and philosopher \u00c9douard Glissant rightfully points out that, from the perspective of enlightened Western thought, understanding people and ideas requires being measured and reduced: \"In order to understand and thus accept you, I have to measure your solidity with the ideal scale providing me with grounds to make comparisons and, perhaps, judgments. I have to reduce. \"1 When there is reduction, there is no relation. Yet Runo's playful reduction of enlightenment to light bulb and its artificial light reveals the reductive Western perspective in relation to the rest of the world, as exemplified in the Humboldt Forum project and similar others in the Western sphere, and relates history with the contemporary in intrinsic ways. We live on the ruins of previous futures (2015 - 19) is the next passage in another kind of story. Comprised of glass jars and burned and broken light bulbs collected from the apartments that the artist and his family have lived in over the last four years in different countries and continents, the work brings the same institution of enlightenment into the domestic space, addressing what ideologically connects the institutional sublime and the everyday mundane. In putting used, burned, and broken light bulbs into jars, Runo alludes to the process of demysti- fication and remystification present in Lampada annuale (1966) by one of his reference artists, Alighiero Boetti, in which a single, oversized light bulb, set inside a mirror-lined wooden box, randomly switches on for eleven seconds each year. Runo's work is also a poetic call to accountability, to be aware of how many natural balances \u2014 and therefore previous futures \u2014 are destroyed in order to safely burn that light bulb in that domestic space. Rather than inflicting guilt, this call suggests that we should embrace awareness with care. There is another side of the coin. The \"coloniality of power\" is a recurring condition in contemporary Latin American societies, which shapes the living legacy of colonialism in the form of social discrimination and political interventionism. This concept was introduced by the Peruvian sociologist An\u00edbal Quijano and further argued by the Argentinian semio- tician Walter Mignolo \u2014 another figure who inspires Runo's engagement with the question of modernity. Mignolo writes: \"Modernity\" is a European narrative that hides its darker side, \"coloniality. \" Coloniality, in other words, is constitutive of modernity \u2014 there is no modernity without coloniality. Hence, today the common expression \"global modernities\" imply \"global colonialities\" in the precise sense that the colonial matrix of power (coloniality, for short) is being disputed by many contenders: if there cannot be modernity without coloniality, there cannot be either global modernities without global colonialities. That is the logic of the polycentric capitalist world of today.211 \u00d6v\u00fcl \u00d6. Durmusoglu184Coming from a family forced to migrate to Argentina from Italy before the heat of colonialist World War I caught fire, and then forced to leave Argentina when the military dictatorship came to power in 1976, next coming to Sweden, Runo is very aware of the forms of fascism that the colonial mind is produced by and continues to produce to sustain itself. The current Bolsonaro government in Brazil, where Runo partially continues to live with his family, as representative of a new generation of anti-establishment alt-right movements, is one reflection of this condition. This coloniality brutally shows itself not only in Jair Bolsonaro's endangering of the whole country through his refusal to deal with the COVID-19 crisis, but also in his attempts at genocide by cutting off water resources to Indigenous communities in such a critical moment when the country and world is attempting to survive a pandemic. When Richard Serra made his famous Hand Catching Lead film in 1968, inspired by Yvonne Rainer's Hand Movie (1967- 68) which shows finger exercises, the art critic Rosalind Krauss framed the hand in action \u2014 trying, failing, and trying again to get hold of material in a repetitive cycle \u2014 as being a gesture of self-reflection and self-reference. The question of how art histories are written, by whom, and for whom comes forward in Runo's own \"hand film\" America I use your name in vain (2019). What kinds of models does Western modern art history propose to artists who are shaped by different contexts of power? The iconic hand of a minimalist artist claiming its material humorously translates into the precarious hand of an artist trying to hold the inner metal circle of 1 Brazilian real, one of the slipperiest currencies in the world, demanding self-reflection from those who write art histories. At the same time, the film can be read as a condition report of the ongoing loss of resources in colonised lands from the deep past up until today. And it points out how these two issues need to be read in relation, rather than treated as separate situations in reduction. \"I first try to see what is behind the image, \" Runo says. He knows that the world is the kind of place where we live among alien gods with weapons of magic, as a Navajo protection song says. His nomadic wisdom shaped between South and North, across continents and oceans, and in relation to political disruptions caused by dominant narratives, is built on the intuition that what is claimed to be contained can never actually be contained. He generously invites the audience to imagine together using the material and immaterial voids he deliberately leaves behind. Runo's stories will always be of the other kind. 1 \u00c9douard Glissant, Poetics of Relation, trans.

During the highpoint of the Apartheid years, a new campus was built (1972) and University College, Durban for Blacks of Indian Origin was renamed: University of Durban- Westville for Indians. After the Apartheid years, the above institution was de- segregated and merged with the other segregated universities for the Zulu and for Whites, creating the post-Apartheid, multiracial university renamed University of Kwa-Zulu-Natal at Durban Westville Image p. 200: The Anti-Apartheid Room at Malm\u00f6 2017 Joakim Sandqvist193The Anti-Apartheid Room The World Turned Upside Down: Art and Ethics in the Rise of the semester, the course \"The World Turned Upside Down: Art and Ethics in the Rise of the 'Stone Age South, '\" initiated by Professor Sarat Maharaj, took place at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. The starting point for the project was a reconstruction of the Art History Room (AH Room) in Durban, South Africa, of the apartheid years. The AH Room was located at the University of South Africa, University College in Durban for Blacks of Indian Origin. The reconstructed room in Malm\u00f6, given the title the Anti- Apartheid Room, served as the backdrop for all events that took place during the course. These included a number of open lectures by speakers from around the world, covering the various themes of the course: migration, colonialism, cosmic awakening, women in historical accounts of apartheid, and the decolonisation of knowledge production. Documentation of the reconstruction, which was done by the artists and then students Sebasti\u00e3o included together with a text by Sarat Maharaj. Among the guest lecturers where Jan Apel, Carlsson, Turned Upside Down: Art and Ethics in the Rise of the \"Stone Age South\" Sarat Maharaj 2017 This text was first published in Malm\u00f6 Art Academy's Yearbook 2016 - 2017. Reprinted by permission of the author. The thrust of today's migrations seems largely \"North- ward\" \u2014 even in the Antipodes, where they are clearly headed towards the opposite pole. The \"South\" has tended to signal underdevelopment and crisis. It has also flagged up notions of other possibilities, alternative perspectives, other designs for living. The exodus from the South to the North is at odds with the idea of the Global South as a privileged vantage point from which to critique the world system. We rather have anomalies and crossovers that affirm and straddle, unpick and unravel in one go the received N / S dividing lines. How to map this topsy-turvy global space, how to take its sound?12 Sarat Maharaj202 On the one hand, with today's migrations, the classic cardinal points and domains \u2014 East / West / North / South \u2014 are constantly fixed, even vehemently asserted. On the other, migratory drives surge and spill over such distinctions, blurring and undoing them \u2014 throwing up fresh contact and interaction. Do these emerging spaces mirror strands of the \"primordial, pristine\" space that our ancestors, Stone Age Homo sapiens, wandered into from \"out of Africa, \" to roam and rove what were the proto continents? An \"unnamed\" space, prior to demarca- tions and orientations \u2014 or should we say, a pre-cardinal space? It seems to echo the rising post-cardinal spatial mentality and experience thrown up, against the odds, by today's migrations. With this streaming movement, do we have the glimmerings of a contemporary Palaeolithic non- cardinality? The starting point for our project at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy was a reconstruction of the Art History Room of the apartheid years. The AH Room was at the Uni versity of South Africa, University College in Durban for Blacks of Indian Origin. This is in the province of Natal with the great Drakensberg mountain range \u2014 uKhahlamba \u2014which includes one of the world's most extensive sites of prehistoric rock art and cave paintings. The reconstruction or recreation in Malm\u00f6, Sweden, could have been in any mode \u2014 art installation, film, diagrammatic or performative statement, walks, discursive picnics, critical rambles, etc. The Art History Room in Durban put on show an \"evolutionary ladder\" of artefacts, artworks, and cultures from across the world. Its effect, if not explicit objective, was to underline a Eurocentric vision of things \u2014 a view not uncommon in art studies of the time. Some took it to imply that the spectrum of world cultures and art forms existed in separate, segregated compartments, almost in parallel universes. To their eyes, the display embodied apartness \u2014 sometimes touted during the apartheid years as a \"multicultural rainbow\" (where, needless to say, some cultures were more equal than others). But did the display also open up \u2014 perhaps quite unwittingly \u2014 counterviews, alternative readings? A glance across the original room inescapably brought into play notions of mix, exchange, and swap \u2014 the sense of brisk translation between diverse artistic and cultural idioms, 203styles, and modes of thinking. What light could this throw on today's migratory swirl of peoples and cultural elements \u2014 on prickly issues of multiculturalism, its limits and shortcomings; on questions of living with diversity, difference, and multiplicity; on much- thumbed notions of hospitality and tolerance; on ceaseless everyday cultural translation and cosmo- politanising forces \u2014 all in a setting of apparent racisme sans race? Our explorations in Malm\u00f6, centred around the reconstruction of the AH Room, which we called the Anti-Apartheid Room, linked up studies of the Swedish anti-apartheid archives, ranging over issues of South African and Swedish women; minorities and their overlooked place in representations of the historical struggles to end apartheid; North and South prehistoric, parietal art; and contemporary ancestral and aboriginal presences. The AH Room had evoked the idea of a world art system: in some ways, it tended to mirror Andr\u00e9 Malraux's cosmopolitan views of art and culture in a \"museum without walls. \" Today, does the development of the global museum \u2014 hand in glove with contemporary creative industries \u2014 see the makings of flat-pack, \"globalised\" art practices across our art education institutions, galleries, and museums? To mull alongside: The AH Room had come into being with apartheid's segregating, ethnicising logic. At the time, opposition to this development was summed up in the slogan \"Knowledge Is Colour Blind. \" What to make of such a claim in the face of today's search for a \"decolonialisation of knowledge\" \u2014 for \"tonal modes of knowing\" \u2014 not least in the thick of an all- encompassing knowledge society with its drive towards a pansophic world? What mileage for art practice, creativity, and art research, not simply as hard-nosed \"knowledge production\" but also perhaps as its opposite, as modes of \"knowledgeable ignorance, \" as Ignorantitis sapiens?12 Sarat Maharaj205Letter to Sweden J\u00fcrgen Bock September 2020 Dear Gertrud, I recently found a folded A4 brochure in my archive. Unfolding it, I recognised it as the contact list of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy from 2004. The Dean \u2014 you \u2014 teachers, staff members, and departments are listed, as well as all students. Crosses, I believe made by myself, indicate the students who participated in my first course in Malm\u00f6, back in 2004/05. It was my longest-ever course at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. Titled \"Art Goes Public,\" it was the result of an invitation you extended to me to develop a public art exhibition for the campus of Link\u00f6ping University together with the group. Extra funding was in place, and having travelled with the group five times from Malm\u00f6 to Link\u00f6ping, I remember well a subtle, consistent, but at the same time productive tension between us as a group and the Link\u00f6ping University administration, which due to the usual structural reasons had to defend its normative structures with rules we had to comply with when dealing as artists with a vast educa- tional infrastructure \u2014 some participants experienced the campus as a \"school as factory.\" My course started in the autumn, and the show was developed over winter and spring \u2014 I remember the heavy snowfall during one of our trips \u2014 before taking place between May 26 and June 18, 2005. We were repeatedly told not to climb the roofs of any of the campus's flat buildings, which finally gave us the title of the show (Don't Climb the Roof). The then students Viktor Rosdahl and Jens Henricson claimed that by \"con- quering\" the rooftops, they felt that they could overcome the intimidating aspects of the architecture they encoun- tered, rising above it. At the time, I imagined climbing the roof of Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Pavilion, which I don't remember finding at all intimidating, thinking that it was Le Corbusier himself who invited the inhabitants of his architecture to enjoy their buildings' rooftops. 13 J\u00fcrgen Bock206 Having spent a substantial amount of time discussing the project with the various participants from Norway, Denmark, Sweden, and the US, I learned a lot about Scandinavian history, politics, conflicts, cultures, and, for someone coming from southern Europe, rather subtly unfolding sensibilities. One work sticks out in my mind to this day, by an artist who is mentioned in the handout (which lists all interventions made on the campus), but whose name I prefer not to reveal because of her anonymous inter - vention in another part of the city. Two signposts \u2014 one on the campus and another, identical one in front of the main station \u2014 were appropriated by adding two signs to each. But the two works unfolded rather differently. Firstly, on the campus, this happened with the permission of the university administration and the knowledge that somehow some art would appear, including the release of the artist's name and a short text on the intervention. The signpost in front of the train station, by contrast, unfolded anon- ymously: no author could be identified, with the artist renouncing the usual system of recognised authorship. The artworks were produced by the same company that had produced the original signposts in the first place, meaning the work was disguised by an appropriated design, like a chameleon taking on the colour of its surroundings. In its anonymity, which might have made some wonder if what they were seeing was art or not, it reminded me of the German writer Robert Gernhardt, who each day inserted a five-cent coin into the letterbox of one of his neighbours, as a reward for giving him something to think about. In Link\u00f6ping, the signs indicated non-existent geographical locations in an almost caricatural way that referenced nationalism and its inherent distrust of the other. In my framing of the exhibition, I claimed that most of the works in Link\u00f6ping rejected the eternal claims usually made by public art projects. I referenced the art critic Craig Owens, who has written that such artworks' \"im permanence provided the measure of their circum- stantiality.\"1 We never removed the signs, however. While writing this letter, I went on Google Street View to look at the front of the main station, with the J\u00e4rnv\u00e4gscaf\u00e9 on the side; it was from here that the artist and I, having brought a ladder for installing the signs, first observed the scene. The signpost still remains where it was, but the online image is too blurred to see if the added signs are still part of it. ***207Jo\u00e3o Penalva and Jimmie Durham mentioned Malm\u00f6 first \u2014 the Academy and the city itself both small and clearly arranged, the name of the place a pleasure to pronounce, with its two M's, much softer than \"Maumaus.\" A town in the south of a country that I only knew through a visit to its capital, in the north; participation in a conference and a visit to the studio of Matts Leiderstam, where I also encountered Cecilia Edefalk. A town in the south of Sweden, where in 1995 you founded a public art academy that proclaimed a hearty and energetic farewell to the entrenched pedagogies of the classical master- student relationship. The term \"pedagogy \u2014 P\u00e4dagogik in German \u2014 is explained in a 1914 German dictionary of the Greek language as being derived from ancient Greek, its original meaning referring to \"the tutoring of a boy in the field of arts and crafts.\" I had developed a classic photography school into a study programme \u2014 Maumaus Independent Study Programme, based in Lisbon \u2014 and Jo\u00e3o and Jimmie en- couraged me to contact the Dean of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, who I had never met, to see if a collaboration between our two institutions might make sense. My memory may trick me here, however: psychological amnesia is common among humans, independent of age \u2014 we call it crypto- mnesia in the field of the arts. But trying harder to re- member, it becomes clear that the driving force was in fact my collaborator M\u00e1rio Valente, who had also worked closely with Jo\u00e3o Penalva. Both spent several weekends in Maumaus's lab and studio, processing negatives and enlarging photographs for one if not several of Jo\u00e3o's projects, and after every session came the same question: Have you contacted Malm\u00f6? I remember my annoyance at having to answer again and again: Not yet! And I remember too my concerns regarding how best to reach out to you, since it felt awkward to just contact an institution in Sweden out of the blue. Finally, before M\u00e1rio stressed me out about it again, I chose a banal if not inelegant solution: a package with some modest publications was organised and sent along with a letter. I recall the feeling that this was not the right way of doing things \u2014 it felt more like I was doing it just for the sake of getting it done and relieving me of the friendly pressure of my dear colleague. I later learned that the books did arrive, but that the letter had gone missing \u2014 I probably unconsciously but on purpose forgot to add it. In the course of my current research for my PhD, I found the letter in the Maumaus archive \u2014 on a hard disk written using the now defunct software ClarisWorks, meaning it can no longer be opened. 13 J\u00fcrgen Bock208 In early 2004, an invitation arrived: take the underground to Oranienburger Strasse station and meet at Linienstrasse 135. It was the birthday party of a Portuguese curator, held on February 14 at the Sharon Stone Bar in Berlin. Isabel Carlos, who was also celebrating her nomination as the next curator of the Biennale of Sydney, had invited an international art crowd, and while I was standing at the counter ordering a drink, someone tapped me on my shoulder to introduce us. Warm-hearted, with a big smile and much laughter, you told me about the missing letter, and of not knowing what to do with this anonymous package of publications sent over from Portugal. Very pragmatically, a visit to Lisbon was arranged on the spot. Details were supposed to be arranged via email, and an initial understanding of your notion of what an art academy is became clear when you requested studio visits with current and former participants of the Maumaus school, so that you could report back on these encounters to your students, in case an exchange programme was agreed upon. And things moved fast! You announced not only that your arrival in Lisbon would come just five weeks after our encounter in Berlin, but also that your International Exchange Coordinator, Jenny Svensson, would join you. I understood that this would be a serious visit and realised that your research trip would overlap with those of the artist Allan Sekula and art historian Sally Stein. Allan came to Lisbon in order to prepare his exhibition at a commercial gallery, which, by supporting a book of his (to be published by Maumaus), was able to convince him to show at their venue. I curated as usual, and as usual when it comes to the selling of art, with all the non-glamorous aspects of the art market, I decided not to translate everything the gallerist said to Allan. Allan's wife, Sally, also came along for her teaching sessions at Maumaus. Of the four of them, I knew Allan best, and you from our very brief encounter in Berlin, so it was a case of taking the bull by the horns: nothing besides the requested studio visits was to be specially organised, no protocol, \"just participate in what is taking talk \"The President's Two Bodies: Stagings and Restagings of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal Body Politic\" was one of the highlights, allowing you to also assist in Sally's dramatic prelude of refusing to give her talk if Allan didn't finish drawing up a long- overdue bill of expenses for the Museu d'Art Contemporani de Barcelona. Our encounter as a group had all the ingredients of a blind date: it could be either a failure or a success, and the question of how to judge which of these it actually was is a story of its own. Both you and Jenny joined the Maumaus participants for Sally's seminar 209 in the legendary \"wallpaper room\" of the old Maumaus, which was only recently substituted by a \"copper room\" in the school's new domicile. At the end, all five of us squeezed into a rental car to head to a hotel situated an hour north of Lisbon. Arriving at the guesthouse O Facho, which is located directly on the beach in Foz do Arelho, Allan instantly dis appeared for a swim in the stormy sea, to the great concern of the hotel owner. Seeing as we were staying one night only, we were lucky to have the best breakfast table reserved for us, with its astonishing view of the Atlantic. We had intense discussions about and around art and politics and all their inherent contradictions, also con- sidering the particularities that are to be taken into account when it comes to teaching art in given, reshaped, and invented frameworks. On the way back to Lisbon, we made a quick stop in Peniche, a port city of fishermen, where you turned strangely quiet as we ate some shrimp in a tiny traditional restaurant. Jenny, rather discreetly, enlightened me that this was due to your enjoyment of the food. Your programme in Lisbon turned out, without my intention, to be rather intense. The excitement of en- counters, the exchange of knowledge and experiences, and the inspiring discussions took all our time and energy. It was only on the last morning before you and Jenny were due to head to the airport that we directors both took an expresso at the counter of the Pastelaria that was close to the old Maumaus. Time was scarce and you got straight to the point: \"And now? How do we continue? Well, you have to come to Malm\u00f6.\" 1 Craig Owens, \"The Allegorical Impulse: T owards a Theory of Postmodernism, \" in Art in Theory, 1900 -1990, ed.

Image courtesy of Jan Engsmark221Lars Nilsson Stockholm, September 2020 During the spring of 1995, I received a phone call in my hotel room in London. I was told I had been appointed one of the professorships at what was to become Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. I accepted, on the condition that I wouldn't have to remain in the position for more than three years. I ended up staying for eleven. The years I spent at the Academy are some of the best times I've had as an artist. Getting to share your knowledge and to follow the trajec- tories of some of our finest contemporary artists in the roles of teacher, colleague, and, often, friend. We started out with a blank slate: an empty building and an ambition to reform art education \u2014 an ambition we went on to fulfil. To play an active role in this kind of upheaval, in which words are to give way to action, one must remain humble enough to admit that some things didn't work in a real-world application. But by the third year, it was mostly in place: a cutting-edge art programme that offered breadth and depth, passionate discussions, and diverse opinions. I am genuinely proud of what we and the students accomplished together. The dynamics and energy that we generated also provided space and momentum for my own artistic practice to flourish \u2014 which explains why I stayed on for all those eleven years.15 Lars Nilsson222 223 225Malm\u00f6 Nacking 2020 Gertrud Sandqvist has a solid background as a curator and critic, something that has benefited the school and its students during all her years as Rector and leader of the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. With her insight, networks, and understanding of how the art world works, she has promoted the Academy's activities and helped students enter the professional field. She has opened up the world to them, and thus also opened up their own worlds. Exhibitions allow artists to meet audiences and to understand whether their artworks are understood by others. Exhibition\u00admaking skills, including the behind\u00adthe\u00adscenes logistics, have long been part of the art Academy's teaching, not least in connection with the students' graduation exhibitions at the school's own galleries in Malm\u00f6 as well as the annual Open Studios exhibition at the Academy itself. Malm\u00f6 Art Academy's recent graduates have frequently exhibited in public and private galleries and museums in the region and internationally. Lunds konsthall, of which I am direc\u00ad tor, has been a recurrent collaborative partner over the last fifteen years, but so have other institutions in the region since the Academy's founding in 1995: Rooseum Malm\u00f6 Art Museum, and Many of the following collaborations between the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and Lunds konsthall have taken place with Gertrud as curator. These exhibitions have helped our visitors grasp how the Academy works and how important it is to the art world, both in the region and far beyond. 16 \u00c5sa Nacking226The Doctoral Programme in Fine Arts The Malm\u00f6 Art Academy was the first art academy in Sweden to launch a PhD in Fine Arts. The programme incorporates two fundamental notions: that contempo\u00ad rary visual art relates closely to other fields of knowledge, and that practising artists have increasingly become in\u00ad volved in investigations transcending a traditional under\u00ad standing of \"artistic practice.\" Doctoral dissertations consist of interdependent visual and textual components. The school's first three doctoral candidates to defend dissertations \u2014 Sopawan Boonnimitra, at Lunds konsthall in September 2006, with the exhibition Three PhD Projects from the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy .1 Sopawan Boonnimitra, an artist from Thailand, presented Lak-ka-pid-lak-ka-perd . The politics of space is central to discussions about the rights and agency of minorities, which often focus on overcoming con frontational dichotomies such as centre/margin, global/local, self/other, hetero/homo. The notion of \"queer space\" was coined as a strategic tool by sexual minorities in the West in the 1990s. A better under\u00ad standing of non\u00ad Western sexual cultures may help us overcome notions such as the \"boundary\" and the \"dichotomy.\" The Thai term lak\u00adka\u00adpid\u00adlak\u00adka\u00adperd literally means \"sometimes closed, sometimes open\" and occasionally refers to homo sexuals. Boonnimitra's research project aimed to explore the Thai urban landscape in relation to the transformation of queer culture in and through the arts. Matts Leiderstam, an artist from Sweden, presented See and Seen . In eighteenth\u00adcentury England, the \"ideal\" pastoral landscapes of Nicolas Poussin and Claude Lorrain inspired landscaped parks and theories of the picturesque. These constructions spread within the British Empire and still partly determine the Western notion of \"landscape.\" Since the early 1990s, Leiderstam has subjected the pastoral landscape to a parallel homosexual gaze, comparing it to the cruising park. See and Seen focused on a painting by Lorrain and a real view of an existing historical landscape. 227Leiderstam entered into different roles \u2014 the copyist, the tourist, the art historian \u2014 and used them as \"routines for seeing.\" Miya Yoshida, an artist from Japan, presented The Invisible Landscapes . Yoshida's research is aimed at the visible, the invisible, and the invisible within the visible. Telecommunications have long been regarded as mysteri\u00ad ous or \"uncanny.\" The Invisible Landscapes investigated the complex spaces created by mobile telephony: new realities generated by small individual acts but connected to the crisis\u00adridden mass imagery of politics, the media, and advertising. The project assessed the impact of the mobile phone as a connecting point for contemporary modes of thinking, not least in visual art. A related issue is how new technologies increasingly involve art. Since its launch in 2001, doctoral programme of the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy has continued to function at the highest international level. International Collaboration The exhibition ESCAPE in January - February 2011 was a collaborative project that involved more than twenty students from four art academies: Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, the Braunschweig University of Art, Maumaus Inde\u00ad pendent Study Programme in Lisbon, and Inter national Academy of Art Palestine in Ramallah.2 Together they worked on the deliberately expansive theme of \"escape\". The mass media constantly feed us reports on disasters affecting humankind. We are flooded with images showing people trying to escape natural disasters, poverty, war, and oppression. Such images provoke both anxiety and fascination. How are they constructed to achieve this effect? Many people also flee into them\u00ad selves. Such inner exile is sometimes to do with protect\u00ad ing a private zone but may also be close to madness. How does the drug culture and the daydreaming that the media encourages relate to our longing to escape reality? The notion of escape contains both violence and desire. How can this be expressed in art? The international and the regional are always intimately interconnected in contemporary art. This is certainly true of art academies, where international 16 \u00c5sa Nacking228exchanges and collaborations are now an established part of the curriculum. Teachers and students from different countries come together to develop an inte\u00ad grated vision of art as an international arena that is sensitive towards the cultural identity of specific regions. In hosting ESCAPE , Lunds konsthall wanted to under\u00ad line the importance of this kind of internationalism, for now and for the future. Research by Gertrud Sandqvist The group exhibition Channelled in February-June 2013, which was curated by Gertrud Sandqvist, was based on the thinking Swedish artist Hilma af Klint (1862-1944).3 The exhibition's title refers to the concept of \"inspiration,\" which original\u00ad ly meant \"breathing in\" \u2014 something that is breathing through you, or that you are precisely \"channelled\" by this something. Inspiration and its crucial importance to practitioners of both science and art has been inten\u00ad sively discussed at various times since the emergence of romanticism in the eighteenth century. In af Klint's lifetime, this discussion was parti\u00ad cularly active within theosophy and anthroposophy, two schools of thought that attempted a synthesis of the known and the unknown, the conscious and the un conscious. Today af Klint is mostly known for her eso teric painting, which can be described as systemic visualisations of complex philosophical and spiritual notions. Her paintings were always preceded by notes, of which those from 1905-16 have been characterised as \"inspired from outside\" (i.e., dictated by spirits, the High Ones) and the later ones as coming from her own spiritualist research. Gertrud had spent several years studying around 150 occult diaries in which af Klint documented her method and process in great detail. They also reveal her relations to the authorities of the time \u2014 not least the founder of anthroposophy, Rudolf Steiner \u2014 and her struggle to maintain intellectual independence. The Channelled exhibition included a hitherto unknown series of af Klint's drawings from 1917, a kind of set of spiritual notes or sketches.229Continuity of Knowledge On the occasion of Lund University's 350th jubilee, the exhibition Wither the Winds at Lunds konsthall, which took place May-September 2017, presented a selection of the many accomplished artists who have been affiliated with Malm\u00f6 Art Academy throughout the years: Professors, Lecturers, External Tutors, and doctoral candidates.4 The exhibition described how the Academy is part of Lund University and was founded in 1995 to continue the activities of the Forum schools of painting and printmaking in Malm\u00f6. Furthermore, it showed how, in a relatively short time, Malm\u00f6 Art Academy has built a solid international reputation for itself, and how it today offers an advanced and varied array of courses and programmes, all adapted to the students' individual needs. The Academy receives a large number of applications every year, not just from all parts of Sweden but also from the neighbouring Nordic countries, Europe, and the rest of the world. It is a great advantage for the region that some of the sharpest students and teachers of contemporary art gather here. The continuation of the sort of research, production of knowledge, and inter\u00ad national exchange undertaken at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy is of great benefit both to our region and to society at large. 1 Professor Sarat Maharaj is Principal Supervisor of the doctoral programme at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, run by Gertrud Sandqvist.

Courtesy of the Hilma af Klint Silja Rantanen 202017 Over the last forty years, the conceptual approach has been ever\u00ad present in contemporary art, and its normativity has been stabilised at the expense of visual observation. These four decades coincide with my own time working as an artist. When I finished art school in 1980, it was already common for young artists to claim that their works weren't composed at all. Regardless of these assurances, most works still revealed the presence of visual ambitions. After two historical waves of purely conceptual art movements, this third phase sees the conceptual strain diversify its basic approach into several less strictly conceptual artistic disciplines. In the last few decades, it has almost become the rule that an artwork, in order to be of substance, must incorporate a metalevel, a cognitive point of view from which the artist can give a theoretical interpretation of their own work and frame its subject within a certain context. In his study Sublime Art: Towards an Aesthetic of the Future (2017), philosopher Stephen Zepke analyses the evolution of conceptual\u00ad isation in art in reference to the theories of artist Joseph Kosuth. Kosuth claimed that the form of the artwork was \"secondary infor\u00ad mation,\" while the work's concept, its \"reason to be,\" was the primary information. Kosuth defined art as a conceptual activity, the purpose of which was to liberate art from the conservative, repressive conditions it was subject to. As Zepke explains: As a result, today art requires a minimum of \" conceptual\" re flection (i.e. rational \"thought\") on its own concept to be con sidered \"contemporary.\" Silja Rantanen236A good example of this minimum condition is a painting that foregrounds its status as a \"representation,\" in this way organizing or at the very least premising its aesthetic and material aspects around its conceptual core or condition.1 The two tendencies mentioned above might be broadly defined as the (modernist) approach to visuality as independent of its knowledge\u00adbased meaning, and the (postmodernist) approach of acknowledging the contextual inter\u00ad actions of all things, respectively. The latter leads to the conclusion that any piece of knowledge is potentially relevant and could be projected onto whatever it is we're currently regarding or depicting. The speech of \"semiotic art\" or \"psychoanalytic art\" is thus mis leading, as semiotic or psycho\u00ad analytic interpretation theory can, in principle, be applied to any work of art. It's certainly foolhardy to attempt a brief, concise definition of a pair of opposites as tightly linked as the one I've sketched above. However, this abstract dichotomy has held a deeply person\u00ad al meaning for me, and still does. It's a common thread throughout my personal history in art. The front lines are always being redrawn, and there is always a risk that one might end up on one's former enemies' side; but despite this, I remain captivated by the intricate interactions of the visual and the conceptual. They have both existed, side by side, as different levels of interpretation, but neither has ever managed to single\u00adhandedly offer sufficiently broad definitions of art. Knowledge cannot do full justice to the essence of art any better than \"innocent\" visuality can. During my own years as an artist, this competition between knowledge and visuality in art has performed a dialectical somersault. As a young artist, I was militant about staging assaults on the modern concept of visuality. Now that the pendulum has swung back to the other extreme, artists seem to be taking less of an interest in compositional considerations. The increasingly elevated station that conceptuality was afforded within the art world reawakened me to the importance of visuality. From the proud creative delight I took in adjusting my thinking and knowledge to art in the early 1980s, I've come to revise my attitude in recent years, and I've ended up com\u00ad mitted to a defence of the sensibility to compositional concerns that I find to be neglected today. The consistent aspect of the \"revisionist\" develop\u00ad ment of my thinking rests in my con\u00ad viction that the ongoing discussion of art between my colleagues and art theorists is an important source of knowledge. My vision always relates to the general discourse within the 237field of art. That's not to say that I blindly conform to the majority, but my opinions are still reactions to the \"received\" opinions of the majority. I don't subscribe to the thesis that a work of art could exist without an appearance. The appear\u00ad ance is a symptom of the structure of the work, which is in turn a reference to the artist's concept. Conceptual art has its own compositional schemes, which are typical of its age. It's essential for an artist to be able to recognise these, as well as to analyse their rela\u00ad tionship to the ideas that one desires to communicate to the viewer. For example, distance to the subject is a core feature of contemporary art. In what way does the external format of the artwork represent this? How can this distance be expressed in a painting, a medium that is essentially affirmative in nature? I will offer two examples of compositional schemes that reflect the conceptual content of contempo\u00ad rary art: installation as an inter\u00ad medial artistic format, and blurred contours in contemporary painting. On Installation To present something is to make an emancipatory gesture. Whoever places buildings in public space in a city plan is exerting power over the city's inhabitants. A corre\u00ad sponding position of power, this time with a hint of the didactic, belongs to the person who hangs artworks for an exhibition. Traditionally, this task has been reserved for others than the artist, to maintain a degree of objective expertise. In the 1960s, contemporary artists began to take action to reclaim the authority to decide about the hanging for themselves. These reactions of artists arose at the same time as the first theories of institutional critique. This emancipation resulted in exhibitions resembling unified works, such as Claes Oldenburg's exhibition The Store (1962) in New York. Among the pioneering works of installation art were the experimen\u00ad tal hangings of found objects in trees in the parks of Rome that Robert Rauschenberg carried out in the early 1950s. It has since become customary for the hanging of an exhibition to be guided by installation\u00adlike principles. Regardless of who is responsible for it, the layout is based on the idea that the architectural surroundings will somehow actively interact with the works of art. Negotiations over the boundaries between the domains of the artists and the institutions are still ongoing. A common, but often unstated, argument offered by artists is that the relationship between the works and the walls is a part of the art. This problematic argument has served us artists well in our struggle to take control over any aspects of the situation that we realise might impact the content of the art.17 Silja Rantanen238 However, artists don't only, or even primarily, make installations for political purposes. On the other hand, installations, as well as certain sociologically oriented art genres, are often utilised by museums be\u00ad cause of their potential for popular appeal. Installations almost fit too well into the general discourse on how art relates to the outside world. My own interpretation is that there are two main reasons why installations are so popular among artists today. First, the gesture of \"presenting\" is an alluring method, as it allows you to create some\u00ad thing without actually fabricating a new object. But second, and more importantly, installation is used as a sculptural format by all media today, because it is such an excellent metaphor for how contextualisation works. Placing objects in a contrast\u00ad ing surrounding, or in a way that makes a surprising comparison, is an act that has the trappings of a scientific experiment while also remaining true to the core notion of creation: combining things to produce un expected results. In the play of children back in the predigital age, the method of installation was often used inven\u00ad tively, in that dolls were animated like puppets whose movements were controlled by the child, who also uttered the doll's lines. Digital gaming represents a continuation of this performative structure\u2014an update, if you will. The first time I encountered installation art, at Kunsthalle Helsinki in 1969, the games I had played as a child were still fresh in my memory. The work in question was Harro Koskinen's installation Svinfamiljen (Swine family). The swine were painted with a dense, yellow pigment, and their habitus had been humanised, although they remained lifeless and smooth. Along with their armchairs, they were arranged into a convinc\u00ad ing simulation of a petit\u00adbourgeois living room complete with a lounge suite. The whole scene resembled an enlarged doll's house or theatre play. However, Svinfamiljen didn't conform to the conventional notion of sculpture, because the figures were able to invade the space and estab\u00ad lish an alternate reality inside the art gallery. The air and the floor around the figures appeared to be within their territory, rather than as aspects of the gallery space's atmosphere. Svinfamiljen thus distanced itself markedly from any classical sculp\u00ad ture incorporating several figures, such as the ancient Greek sculpture Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons (27 AD) or all the famous monuments to groups of shipwreck victims or citizens of Calais, in which human limbs cast in bronze wrap around one another like strands of pastry in an enormous rosette cookie. Koskinen's swine family were uncomfortably perched on their oversized plastic chairs, which had been made using the same method as them. The chairs didn't match 239one another in a plastic sense, either. They took up too much of each other's space, which prevented all the organic mess that is so character\u00ad istic of the spatiality of a pigsty from accumulating. This manner of plastic dystopia lends itself particularly well to being presented as an installation. Objects and beings, insensitively rubbing against one another, without producing the slightest degree of harmony or triggering any response in each other. This is, after all, how our everyday spaces are laid out today. In Helsinki in 1969, Koskinen's structural radicality passed by unnoticed. What ended up causing persecution by the exhibition jury was his painting of the coat of arms of Finland, in which he had replaced the lion with a swine. On Diffuse Contours These days, we tend to think of blurred contours as indicative of a faulty optical instrument. \"The camera lens needs adjusting\" seems to be what a blurred form communi\u00ad cates to us. However, in art, the history of blurred contours goes much further back in time than the manipulation of photographs. In classic landscape painting, the degree of blurriness is aligned with the aerial perspective. The eight\u00ad eenth\u00adcentury painter J.M.W . Turner came up with the idea of painting landscapes in a light that dissolves all solid forms, and this vision of his contributed to the later development of modern and, later still, abstract painting. In more recent art history, blurred contours have served a didactic purpose in colour theory. Art students have been encouraged to blur the contours of their figures in order to maximise the colouristic effect. In this context, blurriness serves an indirect function: to achieve precision in colour use, the other dimensions of painting are temporarily relocated to the background. More than any other meta\u00ad phorical feature, a blurred image can be experienced on a universal level, as a symbol of a loss of faith in progress. The blurriness suggests that the relationships between ignorance and knowledge, on the one hand, and information and knowledge, on the other, have become even more fleeting than before. Blurred contours are a trade\u00ad mark of the artist Gerhard Richter. In the early 1960s, he began to use this method in his paintings, which he based on everyday photographs of both a personal and a journalistic nature. He applied light brush\u00ad strokes using a large brush on a wet, photo\u00adbased painting to achieve a particular effect. This gesture is easily identified and remembered. Paradoxically, its role within the anonymous whole of the image can be interpreted as representative of the artist's own brushwork; but here the blurred contours are mainly used 17 Silja Rantanen240to signify distance, to camouflage the subject, or to introduce a general sense of alienation. Later, Richter would adopt a similar method when working on his abstract paintings, although he was not attempting to conceal the subject in this case. After the arrival of the digital era, we've seen an abundance of variations on Richter's gesture in contemporary art. In recent paint\u00ad ing, this aesthetic has undergone an extensive renaissance and has begun to be used as a reference to the ephemeral nature of digital imagery. As a way of relating to this universal visual idiom of our times, painters have allowed the blurry to enter the medium of painting, although the traditional vocabulary of the field has always held the sharpness of forms to be an exalted virtue. In Ulla\u00adLena Lundberg's novel Allt man kan \u00f6nska sig (All you could ask for, 1995), she provides an excellent answer to the ques\u00ad tion of what a conceptual artwork looks like. The narrative relates an interview with a forty\u00adtwo\u00adyear\u00adold female artist from \u00c5land. The reader isn't told if the subject is a fictional person, or if this is a case of actual social anthropology research, a field in which Lundberg has worked as an academic. The author doesn't pose the question as I've written it here, but rather lets the artist speak freely about her approach to her work, placing particular emphasis on a stressful life situation that ended up becoming a source of inspiration, against all odds. She describes her conceptual series of paintings titled Stork\u00f6k (Restaurant kitchen), which consists of subjects she encountered when she did temporary work on one of the cruise ships that offer passage between Sweden and Finland: You may recall that my objects are a little blurred and indefinite in terms of their form; as though you saw them in the corner of your eye just as they were rushing past. They're meant to make you feel a sense of urgency. Everything revolves around the objects, and you never get to see a whole human being, only parts. A blurred foot next to a broken coffee cup, where the pieces have come to rest, making them seem particularly clear. An arm in a rubber glove, a rear end with a skirt behind the table full of dirty dishes... those kinds of things. Human beings serving functions, rather than being individuals.2 In this passage, we find that a contemporary artist's work is based not on visual observations but on analytical themes. Still lifes of a restaurant kitchen's piles of dishes would never have provided sufficient subject matter. She fuelled her thinking by taking into consideration the fact that her work in that kitchen was essentially involuntary, a task carried out to finance an artist's 241practice. However, this friction between her calling and reality is inspiring to her: although working outside of her area of competence, she uses her expertise to inform her observations. The objects around her give shape to her discomfort. This occurs through blurred, fragmented forms. The narrative of the artist reveals that her subjects are tightly connected to the compositional means that she uses to express her vision. 1 Stephen Zepke, Sublime Art: T owards an Aesthetic of the Future (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2017), 5) Silja Rantanen243Lecture, November 25, 1996 Ola Billgren18 When an artist, of one kind or another, consents to make a public appear - ance and expound his or her views on language, in most cases it is probably with a feeling that the audience will not have too high expectations of his or her competence and reading in the philosophy of language. This was what I thought when I spontaneously accepted an invitation to come to the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and open a discussion on the subject. I imagined that I would enjoy a certain protection by the fact that, in a way, I had already, in my paintings and to a certain extent in my writings, installed myself in language, and that my speech would flow unaffectedly and freely. But soon I felt that a reflection on language that wishes to be clarifying \u2014 and This is a modified version for print of a lecture Ola Billgren gave at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy in 1996 and was part of the Art Academy's Yearbook of the following year. Reprinted by permission of Anita Billgren. nothing else is the case \u2014 could hardly be based on such a privilege; in such cases, it runs the risk of becoming a mere defence. The fact that language in the sense of \"my language\" or \"language for me\" is a conquest, related to artistic practice, does not make my taking part in it any easier and safer when I consider it as a general phenomenon \u2014 which, besides, is something I was aware of from all the occasions when I have broken the silence that surrounds my work. So I must confess that I'm attracted to the difficulty without taking the full consequences of it. I was puzzled when thinking about what kind of presentation I was expected to do. When it comes down to it, it is not about achieving Ola Billgren244the expected but doing the necessary, and this is what is so very difficult in this case. Naturally, I tend to see the work of art and artistic practice as the ultimate form of investigation and communication. Accordingly, there is a sort of moral reason for me for keeping to it, since it is there I should invest my maximum knowledge. On the other hand, it is hardly any help to wrap it up in silence, to be alone with it, although there are many poets who prefer to see things that way. In fact, literature remains ambiguous on this point: it is not always possible to make a clear distinction between literary texts \u2014 narratives, poetry \u2014 and texts that deal with questions of writing. In other words, by entering a dialogue on language I have put myself in a middle position, where the notion that describes my desire best \u2014 to realise myself in my own, more or less unique and exact language \u2014 requires my attention in itself. So I end up out- side of it, but close to it. I am forced to exert myself, and instead of talking from the point of view of what I think I have achieved, I have to talk about the general characteristics of this achieving. We now run up against a question: Why so much work on an attempt to define a specific artistic language, and why does language become the object of exclusive, personal possession? The scope of the question is such that I have no hope of even coming close to an- swering it. But, with the help of a text that came to my rescue, I can at least hope to clarify something in relation to creativity in language. The text, which I will read in its entirety, was written by Novalis1 in 1798, that is, at an early stage of romanticism, when the instrumentalist view of the poetic word came under ardent attack.Novalis, \"Monologue\" There is actually something silly about speaking and writing; true conversation is a mere play on words. We can only admire the ridiculous delusion of people who think that they speak for the sake of things. Precisely what is peculiar about language, that it only cares about itself, no one knows. That's why it is such a wonderful and productive mystery, the fact that when someone just speaks for the sake of speaking, he says the most marvellous, most original truths. But if he wants to talk about something in particular, facetious language makes him say the most ridiculous and confused things. Out of this comes also the hate that so many serious people feel for language. They notice its wil- fulness, but do not notice that the despicable babble is the infinitely serious side of language. If it were possible to make it clear to people that language is like mathemat- ical formulas \u2014 These constitute a world for themselves \u2014 They only play with themselves, do not express anything but their own wonder ful nature, and this is exactly why they are so expres- sive\u2014and this is exactly why they reflect the strange play of relations among things. Only through their freedom are they part of nature and only in their free movements does the world-soul express itself and turn them into a delicate yard- stick and ground plan of things. So it is with language too \u2014 he who is sensitive to its fingering, to its rhythm, to its musical spirit, he who perceives the delicate effects of its inner nature, and moves his tongue and hands to 245it, will be a prophet; on the other hand, he who knows how to write truths like these, but who does not have enough ear or feeling for language, will be made fun of by language and mocked by people, like Cassandra was mocked by the Trojans. If I think that I have shown clearly the essence and task of poetry by this, I am still aware of the fact that no man can under - stand it and that I have said some- thing foolish, because I wished to say it, and no poetry comes about in that way. What if I was compelled to speak any way? And if this linguistic urge to speak were a characteristic of the inspiration of language, of the functioning of language in me? and if my will only willed all that which it was com- pelled to, could this not be poetry anyway, without my knowing or believing it, making intelligible one of the secrets of language? and wouldn't I then have a vocation for being a writer, since a writer, no doubt, is only someone who is inspired by language?2 Novalis formulates some kind of modern poetics in his assertion of linguistic autonomy. When I quote his text, it has to do with his somewhat contradictory and rough-hewn charac- terisation of language. Language, we are told, is both unpredictably unruly, and a perfect, systematic mirror of the relationships in the physical world, and this is exactly what is supposed to make it suited for an employment guided by inspiration and intuition \u2014 a kind of instinctive inclination for being absorbed by language. Accord- ing to Novalis, the result is different depending on whether the person speaking or writing (he does not make a distinction between speech and writing) is prepared to follow the ideal nature of language or if he thinks that it, by necessity, has to convey limited, useful knowledge about things. On the one hand, the constraint of language determines work with it in its untamed state (the author is born), while on the other, language expresses its re fractory character, which only seem- ingly can be controlled. It seems as if these two experiences are specific to two different kinds of people and talents; let us call them the poet- artist and the critic. But there is room for both in Novalis's experience of working with language, and in order to reach the rank of the first and higher kind, he takes recourse to a refined kind of irony against his pretensions of defining the essence of poetry. This transition is critical. This reveals that the obsession with language is existentially grounded and not only an expression of an extant intuition of the essence of language. It is on this foundation that writing becomes a work where the aspiration to come to terms with language dominates the linguistic act. The language that is supposed to be at hand in speech without obligation has, in fact, a utopian magnitude that the author reaches for with all his spiritual pow- ers, a purposeful act that is projected on the image of game and sensual devotion. There seems to be no peaceful relationship with language, but instead a continuous dream of attaining such a state. To use one's powers in an artistic project must, as far as I can see, be connected to a consider - able deal of negative experiences of this dependence on language. Strictly speaking, we are here dealing with our complicated relation with what it means to be oneself or to be \"something\" in general. To the 18 Ola Billgren246same extent as looks and manners, speech and writing are markers of identity \u2014 but they were not supposed to be mere ways, but expressions \u2014 transcendence. For anyone, the necessity to speak may suddenly reveal its negative side and become a reminder of gruesome limitations and restraint. I think we have all had the modern experience of hearing a recording of one's own voice and felt how language, which was supposed to express what one had in mind, joins itself on to a number of unintended external characteristics that seem to have condensed into some kind of dialect, which I don't recognise as me. As a consequence, one may be hit by a kind of language regret. One wishes that one had not been so eager to communicate, that, in the realisation of the linguistic superstructure, one had only exem- plified neutral dignity. Secretly one begins to prepare one's with drawal from the verbal community. Two thoughts go through the mind, one about annihilation \u2014 a small suicide \u2014 the other about starting all over again and once and for all living up to one's ideals and never again being let down by language. In such a situation, one may be motivated to dissociate oneself from language in its trivial, social suavity and concen- trate on its formal level, or even on a level above its formality, and with a sovereign gesture take control of one's own destiny. The attentiveness that is required in this decision makes possible a re-entry in the present moment without being superficial. If it can be maintained that poetry, in the broadest possible sense of the word, realises something inherent in language, it is because it removes language from an area where it produces new propositions, only changing slowly, to an experimental area where a new language can come into being instantaneously. Consequently, language allows \u2014 and does not allow \u2014 a language \"for me.\" This language is the object of neglect, which is why it has to be claimed continuously. P. S. The text above is an extended revision of a shorter script that I brought to a class at the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. The changes can be seen as justified insofar as they represent digressions I made at the original reading and, especially, the lively exchange of opinions that ensued. This reference to conditions for the reader to be aware of should of course not conceal what are simple excuses. I have improved upon my text \u2014 as a result of the sense of irony that irremediably sticks to the subject of language. I don't think I have ever had a feeling of having done such a lousy job as a lecturer as when I left the school building of Mellersta F\u00f6rstadsskolan, where the Academy is housed, and trudged along F\u00f6renings gatan. Certainly, I had said one or two true things, but they bathed in the merciless light of the omissions that stopped me from mastering the subject.247 Franz Gareis, Portrait of T ranslation of \"Monolog, Fiction Mark Kremer19 This text, accompanied by slide projections, was presented as a lecture at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy in 1997 and published in the Art Academy's Yearbook 1996 - 1997 under the title \"Just What Is It that Makes Today's Bodies So Lucid, So Prolific?\" Republished by permission of the author. My talk deals with an issue that from 1990 onwards received a lot of attention in the critical discourse on contemporary art. The issue could be described as the re-enact- ment of certain visual motifs that were part of 1970s performance art. This re- enactment occurs in what I, for the time being, will call the \"performance- related work\" of a number of younger artists who entered the art scene in Europe and to a lesser extent North America around 1990. The appreciation of this development varies. The art historian Benjamin H.D. Buchloh, for example, argues that it all comes down to a spectacularisation of practices from the 1960s and '70s, such as those of Fluxus artists, with their interest in the transient event and ephemeral artistic utterances in the world.1 Other critics, on the contrary, cherish the link of this recent art to developments in the 1970s. They point out that today's artists seem to have similar interests in, for instance, process-oriented art, context-specific installations outside galleries and museums, and, in general, the reciprocity between art and the world. Many years ago, the art critic Lawrence Alloway, for that matter, talked about the \"expanding work of art\" when addressing practices that evolved in the 1960s and '70s (he juxtaposed these with the prac- tices of painting and sculpture that were more prevalent at the time). Who is right when it comes to the current development: the pessimists, who say that we have seen it all before \u2014 and in more original art \u2014 or the optimists, who take Mark Kremer1997250 pleasure in the affinity to an earlier epic art era that today's artists seem to put forward, thus pushing aside the evil era of 1980s art, which supposedly was only about the money? Some artists that I will talk about today have acknowledged an in debted ness to practices from the 1970s. Studying their work, one can find substantial evidence of a relation to early performance art. This is what I will do. But in the first instance, looking at current performance- related work, my atten- tion was drawn by what seemed to be, to me, mere replay of motifs and motivations from the 1970s. 1. Some years ago, while attending a conference where members of art communities from all over the world had come together to talk about the current state of things in contem- porary art, one evening a group of participants left the meeting and ven- tured to the outskirts of the city of Stockholm. There, in some deserted building that temporarily was a home base for poets, painters, musicians, and peculiar other talents, various artworks including video and film projections and live art were to be presented. I was among the people who had chosen to take the trip, and without distorting the truth too much, I can say we were rather excited at the prospect of seeing an art spec- tacle after all the scholarly musings. But, when witnessing the first live act \u2014 two youngsters, boys in their twenties, were indulging themselves in a sadomasochistic act in a bare room reeking of vomit \u2014 we realised that our expectations had been too high. The boys were kicking ass: one stood behind the other, kneeling on the floor, pants down, receiving, on his butt, kicks from his companion, who made him crawl through the room like a dog. The picture was probably intended as an appetiser, offering morbid amusement until, so I presumed at the time, spectacles of a more lofty kind would erase the memory of a charade. And yet, this did not happen. In spite of the events that were presented later that night, the ghastly image of the boys in their carnal tangle has stayed with me since then, and from time to time it crops up like a phantom paying me an unexpected call. What is it that makes this image so persistent? Why does it keep on coming back? Its vile and unattractive appearance \u2014 however strongly a squat mien may imprint itself on the memory of a susceptible person \u2014 cannot explain the ineradi- cability of this image in a satisfactory way. That leads me to look for a more profound explanation. Let us focus again at the act in question. What I see before my mind's eye is the depiction of a phrase, \"kicking ass, \" with its particular connotations. This act could be understood as some kind of sequel to the performances of the 1970s, in which verbal ex - pressions, such as proverbs, were visually rephrased by artists who, in the performance, often looked like stick figures almost devoid of their own will. However, the act of the boys also has a lot of aspects that 251contradict this reading. The young- sters performed a \"poor\" spectacle, more representative of terror in inter - relationships than showing the real thing, conveying the hard emotions. There was irony in the air, non-belief! Somehow their gestures seemed prescribed by signals coming from a distant source, which rather gave the sensation of an after-image. Lack of structure made it impossi- ble to experience the act as a rite of passage \u2014 the objective of many performances in the 1970s. In short, the performance of the two boys suffered from a flawed command of a visual language, and hence a view - er obtained the feeling of witnessing an event in which youngsters were simply acting out their exhibitionism. In their exposition of unprocessed affects, we can observe a crucial difference in the early performances. To refresh our memories, let me offer this example of the Dutch artist Pieter Laurens Mol, who made a small number of performances in which one can discern the influence that Fluxus had on him. In 1975, Mol realised an act in the seclusion of his studio, where he, dressed in white overalls, threw himself on the floor repeatedly, to cleanse it with his body. The camera was the only witness as Mol visualised a twisted poetic phrase: Einmal Schnell mit Mir Selber den Boden Fegen (To wipe the floor for a change, 1975 - 76). His act, like many early performances, was a solo adventure in which an artist painstakingly choreographed himself for the sake of testing bodily limits. Only at a later stage could the public take notice of an enterprise that \u2014 by then \u2014 would have transformed into a stylised momentum. In the 1970s, many perfor- mances were executed in peripheral places by artists who were not a priori concerned about public expo- sure. They would record their actions solely for themselves, because they regarded them as highly individ- ual, and in many cases even didn't consider them as works to be made public. The difference of the current performance art, compared to acts from the 1970s, is indeed a matter of public address. The curator Daniel Birnbaum writes, \"The exposure is of a completely different type: it is not about the lonely space of the lyric poem, but about a kind of total vis- uality that is rooted in the electronic visual media. \"2 Birnbaum's distinction is crucial, but for one objection: it doesn't take notice of the condition that determines the nature of a lot of current work that is produced under the label \"performance art. \" Today's world is one of cultural feedback! And today's art is the substantiation of a lack: artists realise acts whose essence is derived from performanc- es of the 1970s, which they got to know via visual and verbal records, but did not experience. The 1990s manifest the return of visual and other vocabularies from the 1960s and '70s in many cultural fields: film, design, music, fashion ... The omnipresence of information leads to the emergence of odd phenomena. In a future book on twentieth- century art, one chapter simply will have to be 19 Mark Kremer252dedicated to the motif of repetition. One example is the return of the spectre of the \"bed pieces\" of Yoko Ono and John Lennon (Bed-in for Peace, 1969), Chris Burden (Bed Piece, 1972; Oh, Dracula, 1974), and Marina Abramovi and Ulay (Communist Body / Capitalist Body, 1979) in performance- related work in the 1990s, by artists like Aernout Mik (Project for La Vie Conference Centre, 1993), Elin Wikstr\u00f6m (What would happen if everybody would act this way?, 1993), and Janine Antoni (Slumber, 1994). At the end of the century, it seems to be crucial to decide which images one should rescue and bring into the next millen- nium. Everybody looks beyond 1999 in his or her own way: the boys in Stockholm, who are perhaps hostag- es of a cherished picture they want to reanimate; critics who try to write new things on current performance practices but are meanwhile holding on to old ideas about the genre; and even 1970s artist Marina Abramovi , who wants to reperform a number of acts that were originally executed by Vito Acconci, Chris Burden, Dennis Oppenheim, and Gina Pane.3 Other artists are redoing their own performances. A 1996 catalogue of such instances could mention Matt Mullican, who in Brussels remounted an early performance work in which he subjects himself to hypnosis; Dan Graham, who in Vienna redid his Performer / Audience / Mirror of 1975 (I will return to this piece later); and Marina Abramovi and Ulay, who on November 30, the birthday that they share, redid a performance in which they stand still to the sounds of a tango, undoing this static pose when the music comes to an end. The catalogue could also mention Mike Kelley and Paul McCarthy, who remade pivotal work by Vito Acconci, an artist they admire (Fresh Acconci, 1995). And it could mention the video of a certain Dennis Bellone, a New York artist who redid, in slapstick mode, some famous Aktionen of a European precursor of performance art, Joseph Beuys, pulling a coat over his head as a tent and talking in a small apartment to his cat \u2014 thus referring to Beuys's piece I Like America and America Likes Me (1974), in which Beuys shacked up with a coyote. The title of Bellone's piece, Joseph Beuys Is Underrated (1993 - 96), comes at a time when, with Beuys being dead, the urgency of his message is fading away (plus it also refers to a sculptural piece by Beuys himself: The Silence of Marcel Duchamp Is Overrated, 1964). 2. Lately we have seen an increase of critical publications in which the visual language of today's art is viewed as an externalisation, at times a somatic one, of a crisis of the postmodern subject. The difficulty human beings experience in connect- ing with the world has, since around 1990, been addressed in work that depicts reality in a confronting way. The American art critic Hal Foster introduced the term \"traumatic realism\" to talk about this work. With the term, he addresses in particular the transgressions depicted in work 253by artists such as Mike Kelley, Cindy Sherman, and John Miller. His argu- ment is that these artists \u2014 through their depictions of the grotesque body, the vulnerable body, or the body exposed to forces that cannot be controlled \u2014 give us tools to con- front the pain of our era (or our own pain). He argues that people tend to suppress their discontent with their culture, and that art can undo this denial through a repetition of instances that bring the suppressed to the surface again. Foster borrows the term \"traumatic realism\" from the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, who, in the early 1960s, defined the traumatic as \"a missed encounter with the real. \"4 Foster's idea points to one of today's crucial issues: the lack in our relation with the world. One example is the current informa- tion technology. On the one hand, we have at our disposal a multitude of highly developed tools to reach out into the reality around us; on the other, we often feel that a huge gap is separating us from it. A doctor making a diagnosis of the condition of our culture would certainly put for - ward the case that there is a problem in the sphere of communication. The huge increase in electronic communication means an age-old human skill is getting cornered: the ability to tune our messages in a refined way and get them across with the same acuteness. With regard to contemporary art, I have my doubts about the fact that, in the work of quite a lot of artists, I encounter visual languages with a blunt directness, derivative of the ways of television and other news media. This work provides us with information, but does it also convey experience? The problem I just mentioned has been brought up before. This is a recurrent question in modern thought as far back as the 1930s, when Walter Benjamin wrote a short and terse observa- tion on the level of estrangement caused by an ever growing army of apparatuses that bring all kinds of information within our reach. Central to Benjamin's text is the notion of im- poverished experience. Ultimately, it is the result of the forces of the pro- gress of modern society. Benjamin starts his account with the example of the newspapers that bring us each morning the latest information on what's happening in the world. Yet, so he says, in our lives, we are short of wonderful stories! As a counter - balance, Benjamin retells the story of the Egyptian pharaoh Psammenitus as it was written down by Herodotus, the ancient Greek historian, in his chronicle of ancient times.5 Psammenitus, king of the Egyptians, after having been taken prisoner by Cambyses, who was the king of the triumphant Persians, was subjected to public humiliation. Cambyses ordered that the Egyptian pharaoh should be put in a place where he would face the Persian triumphal procession. Cambyses had it so arranged that the prisoner first saw his daughter moving past, now turned into a maidservant, carrying her pitcher to the well. While all the other Egyptians shed tears over the sight, Psammenitus stood 19 Mark Kremer254 motionless, his eyes fixed on the ground. And he continued doing so when soon thereafter in front of him his son, a rope around his neck and a horse bit in his mouth, was led to the place of execution. However, the moment Psammenitus saw one of his former servants in the line of prisoners, an old man who used to sit at his table, now reduced to pov - erty, he struck his head with both his fists and displayed all signs of grief. This tale, says Benjamin, contains the secret of the true story: it doesn't exhaust itself. It saves its power, the core within, so that it may unfold itself later. The French philosopher Michel de Montaigne returned to the story of this Egyptian king, following Herodotus. Montaigne asks: \"Why is it that the king be- gins to wail when he sees the old valet, why not before?\" Montaigne answers: \"He was by then filled with grief; this small addition was enough to take his defences down. \" But other readings are also possible. Benjamin tells us about a gathering of his friends, on which occasion he asked them what they thought of the king's behaviour. One friend argued: \"The king is not moved by the fate of the kingly; that is his own. \" Another one: \"Much on stage touches us that doesn't in our lives; to the king the servant is merely an actor. \" And the third one: \"Intense grief gets stored within and only comes out with a relaxation. To the king, the view of the servant brought this relaxation. \" \"If this story would have occurred today, \" a fourth one remarked, \"next morning all newspapers would have written: 'To Psammenitus, his serv - ant was dearer than his children. '\" I have quoted Walter Benjamin at length. Firstly because I see a strong link between performance art and storytelling: storytelling plays a major role in its reception. What is left of these acts, once they are done, is often a sediment in text and pictures that appeals to memory. Consider how certain works \u2014 I'm thinking of acts by Vito Acconci, Chris Burden, Rebecca Horn, and so on \u2014 live on in our culture. The historical perfor - mances as artworks per se are no longer there; what remains is their stories. Secondly, Benjamin's account offers testimony that a story can be retold in such a way that its listeners experience a momentum or happen- ing in the here and now \u2014 through words. But what about the images? What about live art that is being re-enacted? Can performances \u2014 live events whose visual manifestation in the 1970s was often limited to a singular time and place \u2014 be restaged and keep their original energy? Many early performers, as we know, did not raise this question. They were interested in singular events. But nowadays artists seem to approach the issue from a more liberal perspective. Think, for instance, of the American artist Janine Antoni, who, on several occasions, realised a performance called Loving Care (1992 - 95), in which she patiently and in a dedicated way painted the floor of a room in an art space with black rinse, using her long hair as a brush.6 Did Antoni use the weaknesses of an art world suffering from 255 nostalgia for the 1970s? Her per formance Loving Care, through repeated acts of mopping a floor, seems to have evolved as a critical gesture inspired by 1970s feminist artists. Possibly she wanted to reclaim territory delineated by Yves Klein and his Antropom\u00e9tries (1960), for which he used the bodies of women as brushes. Possibly she wanted to present a case of rebellious belle peinture.7 A certain pleasure is what she shares with us. Antoni leaves the heavy feminist heritage behind, but this heritage also informs her work ... I discern a kind of blending of her performance with that of Klein \u2014 a jolly union of copy and original! The recent reception of performance art abolishes in fast pace the hierarchy between primal acts and secondary documents. Text, photographs, and video and film documents inform a young generation about historical art. A lot of performance art since 1990 has sprung from a desire to revivify a heritage: that of the secondary documents. 3. I would like to proceed to a discus- sion of some recent works that, in my view, relate to 1970s performanc- es and their existential mood, but that also undo this link through their particular lightness. However, there is another matter that I need to attend to first. Several critics have claimed that the renewed interest in perfor - mance art that started around 1990 came from a consensus of opinion that at the end of the 1980s art had arrived at a dead end. As if it had lost its inner drive. And then some people started to consider performance art, because of the way it embodies protest against mainstream culture, as a model, an example, for the new art. A tricky view, of course, as art is always changing. It does seem relevant to ask: What happened to the radicality (read: political concern) of the performance artists? Where did it go? Did it suddenly vanish, like a thief in the night? To answer these questions, let us find out how one of the prominent 1970s performance artists is responding to this renais- sance of performance art. For that matter let's consider a recent performance by Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen). Ulay is known because of his performances with Marina Abramovi . The artists called these acts Relation Works. After his collaboration with Abramovi , Ulay continued as a solo artist active in photography and performance art, same as before his meeting with Abramovi . My approach to the per - formance in question is complex, be- cause it was part of Festival a/d Werf, an annual event in spring in Utrecht where theatre and art projects are shown in various spaces and sites throughout the Dutch town during a ten-day festival. I was the art curator there from 1994 to 1997). On the night of May 25, 1995, Ulay presented a performance called Der Begeisterer (The animator). The work was a poignant proposal as to what performance art was in the past, and what it perhaps could be in the present.19 Mark Kremer256 Der Begeisterer took place in a lecture room of a former univer - sity building on the outskirts of Utrecht. This structure, erected at the beginning of the twentieth century, an impressive brick gestalt, was called the Rudolf Magnus Institute once, accommodating the Faculty of Medical Science. At the time of Ulay's performance, the place was approaching a dilapidated state. Now, picture yourself in front of the building in a row of visitors. It's a cold spring evening and with the others you are standing in a queue, not knowing what to expect, eager to get in. Next moment you enter, walk up the stairs, and are allowed into a lecture room that still bears all the signs of the teaching that took place there: an arrangement of benches rising like the seats of a theatre; a balcony looking towards a place where learned scholars stood, instructing students in the ways of their knowledge; and the impressive rostrum, a wooden table annex labo- ratory case, behind which speakers addressed the audience. While you take in this aura, you take a seat. Little by little, the room gets filled, and with many others, you wait until the person who handed you the flashlight at the back entrance of the lecture room, and bade you welcome, goes to the front and takes his place behind the rostrum. Various items have been prepared: skull, transistor, a chalice with blood, mortar, hammer, stone, and a bottle of water. Now that man walks to the front, switches off the fluores- cents, turns on a desk lamp, and starts to read a text from a paper that he's holding in his hands: The American artist Vito Acconci started with body works in the 1970s. He announced the first work with a poster stating \"body as space. \" From then on a wave of body works, body art and body language emerged across the USA and soon in Europe. A first generation of \"body oriented\" performance artists, like Chris Burden, Dennis Oppenheim, Charlemagne Palestine, Terry Fox amongst others, were to break with the object oriented tradition. Instead they came to terms with \"life-like art, \" a word invented by Allan Kaprow, who himself be- longed to the happening genera- tion which, prior to performances of the 1970s, was active during the 1960s and into the 1970s. \"Life-like art\" as opposed to \"art-like-art\" focused on pure ex - istential matter in which the body is central. The body implicating a reservoir in which all exists, a microcosmos with the same complexity as that of the macro- cosmos. A vehicle by which to accumulate, to catalyse and to communicate. A space in per - manent motion and permanent emotion, a biochemical laborato- ry, a psycho- and memory bank, a room to move. Body as space, imagine. The inner space of our body, thus the negative space. Both spaces we feel or sense, we can sense a cold breeze of air on our skin, while at the same 257time feeling our comfortable body temperature. We can see a cruel action or violence by the sensory perception through our eyes and at the same time feel sordidness, which may sicken us. Emotion might be the bottom line, the basic climate for our conditions. Emotion is condition- ing our well being or not being well, and emotion is subject to most disturbances. Emotion can get us in and out of our minds, for both are difficult to stabilize, speak control.8 After twenty minutes, Ulay's talk ended with a recapitulation of the rules that he and Marina Abramovi set themselves as they began to realise their Relation Works in 1976: no fixed living space, permanent movement; no predetermined ideas in anticipation of the time, place, and location where the performance would be held; no rehearsals, no repetition; the aspiration to create something unexpected. Then the second part of the performance began. The academic lecture changed into a poetic reading in which Ulay prepared the public \u2014 and himself \u2014 for what was going to happen next. \"I will turn into the model of my reading, \" he said at some point. Prior to the execution of a succession of acts with a ritual tenor, Ulay invited his assistants, who were sitting in the front row, to come forward. Eight young women, dressed in black miniskirts, each with a pair of cymbals in her hands, sat down on chairs placed left and right of the rostrum. And they almost im- mediately began to send soft waves of music through the room. Ulay now proceeded with the ritual. With the hammer, he coolly and systematically crushed the skull; he destroyed the transistor, which, a moment before had been playing classical music, and grinded the pieces to powder in a mortar. Then he put the pulverised organic and manufactured matter in a bottle and added blood to the particles. The third part of Ulay's perfor - mance began when all the lights were turned off. Quietly, Ulay un- dressed, walked around the rostrum, and stepped on it, striking a pose with his back turned to the audience. In his right hand, he took the bottle with the compound of blood and the other particles, putting it over his head. Dozens of flickering flashlights illuminated the artist in the shape of a classical sculpture. The young women by now were producing a music that at times was unbearable. Repeatedly, Ulay poured trickles of the liquid compound on his head. Thin red lines of blood emerged on his back: a human \"drip painting. \" On the whole, Ulay stood on the rostrum for almost an hour and a half. The audience responded strongly. At a certain point, having become restless to an almost unbearable degree, people started to throw paper airplanes; soon after that, they were clapping, stamping, and yelling. Always there was one flashlight on. But when many lights were finally switched off, and the women with the cymbals were too 19 Mark Kremer258tired to continue making any more music, Ulay stepped down from the rostrum. Slowly he pulled his feet out of the pooled blood on the plat- form, bent his body, and descended. When his feet touched the floor, those still present in the lecture room could hear the cracking of his bones. He only turned around and paid reverence. 4. In a talk that I gave last year I pre- sented some ideas about this work.9 I proposed that Ulay's work regauges the meaning of performance art: his work reminded a public without a direct experience of 1970s live actions of its essential traits. First, in choosing to make a new work, Ulay pointed out that we should perhaps speculate less about the history of performance art, since so many of the early performers are still around, artists who can show and tell. Second, Ulay's act can be positively related to the recent work of younger artists. His performance in Utrecht regauged the meaning of performance art in different ways. One, his work implied a cri- tique of painting and sculpture \u2014 by addressing their limitations with imagery derived from these arts! His act was in tune with the iconoclasm of performers like Yves Klein, who exposed the limitations of painting in his live acts, particularly in his staged photograph Le peintre de l'espace se jette dans le vide (The painter of space throws himself into the void), printed in a newspaper on November 27 , 1960, that was produced by the artist himself. The attempt to break the static nature of a picture can also be seen in Ulay's act, which exposed the limitations of sculpture, notably its insufficiency to depict life in a manner that does it justice. Secondly, Ulay's act invoked the exchange between performer and au- dience, at various levels. At a certain point, a switching of roles occurred, as a formerly passive public began to take part in an active way, becoming the animator. The shift from subject to object (and vice versa) befalling performer and audience is character - istic of many body-oriented perfor - mances of the 1970s. And, finally, noteworthy is the building up of Ulay's performance in three sequences: lecture on body art and its origins, poetic reading, and nude act. These parts of the performance relate to mind states of rationality, susceptibility, and surrender. Form journey of the mind to rite of passage! Ulay realised the final episode of his act in the dark. The framing of this part is remarkable: the subdued mood of this sequence strongly contradicts the aspiration for total visibility that Daniel Birnbaum wrote about. In the image of the naked man, his back turned to the audience, there was a stillness that somehow reminds me of the unemphatical presence of the early performers. With Ulay, the image of the man became a picture that seemed to be there almost for itself, as if it was separate from its surroundings. Can one presume that Ulay intended his work to end as a kind of still life 259that \u2014 given the flashlights' limited battery power \u2014 would gradually fade away? In the talk I gave last year, I proposed that the ephemeral quality of the last part of Ulay's act connects with recent performance-related work. I am now less sure of that idea. Ulay's act was based on oppo- sition. Vis-\u00e0-vis the public he per - formed an act that was monumental in scale. That the work depicted the monumental as an illusion, a man- made construct, does not alter the fact that he created a confrontation with his public. His performance was an act of opposition. But we can relate Ulay's act to performance-related work that involves dealing with pain. Historical performance art has many examples of acts in which emotions such as pain, anger, and anxiety are imagined in a very pure and direct manner. Let me present a few specimens of current performance-related work that can be grasped as visualisations of such emotions. The Dutch artist Job Koelewijn in 1993 produced a work with the motif of voluntary, self-elected im- prisonment. He made a wooden box of five sides, twenty-five by twenty- five centimetres, covering these with mirrors to reflect the immediate surroundings. Occasionally he would put this on as headgear. In this way, impulses of the world would bounce off the cap, while at the same time he was in the midst of them. A colour photograph depicts the artist wearing a brown coat. It is autumn, he is in a forest, the mirrored cap on his head, the object indicating the dividing line between the artist's persona and the outside. The Spanish artist Pepe Espali\u00fa, who died in 1993 due to AIDS, in the last years of his life did a perfor - mance at the exhibition Sonsbeek 93 in Arnhem. High up on a tree, he slowly undressed on a wooden plat- form, showing his emaciated body to the spectators. As he put his clothes aside, the platform started to resem- ble a nest, where he could finally put his body to rest. Thus in this act a kind of exorcism emerged, perhaps as an attempt to undo rage about being trapped in a doomed body. The American artist Stephen Shanabrook in 1995 realised a per - formance that he recorded on 8 mm film. Bandaged took place on a sunny day in San Ygnacio, Texas, during which the artist wrapped pink candy floss around his hands, took a walk in the park, and lay down on the grass, striking a pose as if he had dropped dead. As the floss melted, his hands began to look like wounded flesh. Inquisitive ants taking delight in the sugar finally put an end to the action. Although these works address the sadness in our lives, it's impor - tant to distinguish the lightness that prevails here. A lucid element appears in them, as if the body itself becomes transparent. 5. I want to make a final remark on Ulay's performance. I defined several aspects of his act that relate to his- torical features of performance art: a critique of sculpture; the role switch 19 Mark Kremer260between performer and public; the transitional element (rite of passage); the stillness that remained in the end as an introspective mood. But there is one feature that I did not mention yet. What I find really contemporary about Ulay's performance is his stylised hesitation with regard to the execution of his performance. The energy and time he invested in the preparatory stages can be read sym- bolically. As if Ulay was asking the Gods of Performance Art for direc- tions, so as to do the right thing ... The academic lecture and the poetic reading seem in retrospect as exor - cisms of sorts, disciplined attempts to get rid of a surplus of experience, or to cast this aside and regain the innocence required for the fabrication of a work that does not yet exist in the world. Such contemplation on the act of creation: it is a subject in contem- porary art, and especially in works that want to establish a relation with art tradition. An outstanding case is Passion, the film by Jean-Luc Godard from 1982, featuring a film director who is reconstructing paintings by Rembrandt, El Greco, Francisco Goya, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, and Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, among others, recreating them in the form of 3D tableaux with actors. His wants to film the spatial scenes and go into the paintings with the camera, to discover their inner life. Godard uses the figure of the troubled film director to investigate the question: Can cinema extract artworks from their history and transpose them to the present? He wants to activate the power of the works! Godard's answer is ambiguous. Passion is the tale of an artistic impasse. At a certain point, the ambitious film project comes to a halt as problems accumulate: there is an issue with the lighting of the 3D scenes that makes it impossible to get the right shots; there are huge financial obsta- cles; there's a strike in a local factory, which means that those factory people who have been engaged to perform as actors or extras in the film in their spare time cannot come to the set anymore \u2014 they have to stick with their strike project! Plus a love affair develops between the filmmaker and the conductress of the strike, played by a stuttering Isabelle Huppert, who likes to quote Karl Marx ... And so, our film dissolves into fragments of stories, putting aside the grand narratives whose live textures it wanted to recreate. And the prosaic conditions on which the production of an artwork depends are exposed. Indirectly, in a humor - ous manner, the film tackles the artistic and worldly issues that all artists (including the makers of the director's paintings) face when making their works. I have dwelled a bit on Godard's film because I see a resem- blance between the re-enactment of historical paintings in Passion \u2014 Rembrandt's Night Watch (1642), Goya's Tres Begeisterer: Ulay and Abramovi 's Relation Works are present as a kind of second layer in the piece! Der Begeisterer was 261not a reconstruction of their work, but it was a commemoration. Con- sider, for example, their performance Imponderabilia (which means \"things that are not weighable\"), executed in Bologna, Italy, in 1977 . Ulay and Abramovi stood in the entrance of the Galleria Comunale d' Arte Moderna, where an art fair was being held, facing each other. Both were naked. Visitors to the fair had to pass through their human gate. 6. It is time to get back to my earlier question: What happened to the radicality of the pioneers, the first performance artists? Is it true, as people today sometimes say, that young artists don't take a political stance anymore? Is there no work with a mission in the present? Then again, \"political engagement\" is almost a synonym for the philosoph- ical-artistic climate of the 1960s and '70s. In those years, progressive artists were, by definition, political artists. \" As a medium, performance art was initially intensely political in orientation. \" This is what Henry M. Sayre writes in The Object of Per formance: The American Avant- Garde since 1970.10 The American scholar locates the rise of perfor - mance art in the US against the background of the emergence of a broad counterculture that saw various events such as the 1967 San Francisco Human Be-In in Golden Gate Park or the Angry Arts Week, a manifestation in New York organised that same year as a protest against the Vietnam War. Because the term \"political\" is burdened with historical mean- ing, it is not so easy to use in the current debate, for contemporary art. Also, \"politics\" is not easy to identify; it has transformed itself into an infinitely ramified body whose members pursue dispersed interests. The philosopher Michel Foucault remarked around 1968 that politics had disappeared in society's substra- ta. In the 1970s, developments took place that came down to a \"goodbye to ideology. \" At a certain point, there was a shift from an idealistic attitude toward life and a belief in the collec- tive enterprise, to an individualist approach to life. This shift can be seen in the \"bed pieces\" that I men- tioned. There is a difference between the overtly politically concerned Bed-in of Yoko Ono and John Lennon and the distant and doubtful mood that permeated the act of Marina Abramovi and Ulay. Both works addressed issues that had huge impact on many people, respectively the Vietnam War and the psychic deformations caused by communism and capitalism. But the way these matters were taken up differs. Ono and Lennon still believed in the possibility of changing the world for the good, while in Ulay and Abramovi 's act there was an acknowledgement of the individual's powerlessness to do so. A similar resignation was already part of Chris Burden's acts of the 1970s, which I read as stagings of mythical enterprises, and suffering in an environment that does not seem to care.19 Mark Kremer262 Elin Wikstr\u00f6m, Aernout Mik, and Janine Antoni do not address the world at large. Wikstr\u00f6m and Mik created performative works in the micro-cultures of a super - market and a conference centre. Also Antoni's Slumber, the transfer of the inner motions of a woman asleep in the night \u2014 via an electroencep- halogram \u2014 onto a weaving that she made during the day does not seem to take a straightforward oppositional political stance. These works simply provided imaginaries of sleep and dreams. Mik inserted \"sleepers\" in the midst of a building in Utrecht where people gather and work. He thought of this tableau vivant as a reinforcement of a dreamlike daily atmosphere. Wikstr\u00f6m placed her bed in a supermarket in Malm\u00f6 as an act of refusal. She stayed put the whole day, above her head a red digital sign displaying the words: One day I woke up feeling sleepy and in a bad mood. I pulled the cover over my head, for I did not want to get up, look around or talk to anybody. Under the cover I said to myself: \"I am going to lie like this, without moving, without saying a word, as long as I feel like it. I'm not going to do anything, just close my eyes and let my thoughts wander. What would happen if everybody did that?\" These works are lucid but are not without critical potential. They act like mirrors reflecting our world. Sometimes it's revealed with humour. The figures in these works penetrate semiclosed systems and expose \u2014 through a contrasting presence \u2014 the peculiarity of these orders. The works unfold their own narrative amid daily life, bringing about odd displacements in the reason of the day. Lately, such light-heartedness can be seen in a type of image that is reinvented as we speak: the group portrait. This genre offers new possibilities. The optimism about the collective endeavour may be over, yet we need images in which people stand and come together. It can be that we're not united by one idea or ideal but that we have a lot in common. Let me introduce some of these group portraits. An impor - tant reference is Dan Graham's 1977 work Performer / Audience / Mirror. Perception and cognition were the themes of this piece in which the artist, in four successive stages, described the external features and movements of people \u2014 he saw them in a mirror \u2014 and those of himself, as well as the internal attitudes that he believed to be signified by all that. While Graham made an X-ray or an archaeological study of the group and its behaviour, younger artists today treat the subject with humour and irony. They seem even more attracted to the idea of its illusion. One example is Aernout Mik's Langer oder liegender Affe (Long or reclining monkey, 1996). The work was installed in the public space of the German town of M\u00fcnster, on a sidewalk next to an austere 1970s flat. Perhaps the title refers 263to outward form: an aluminium sluice reminiscent of those used in airports for passengers boarding planes. In a similar way, the visitor had to board or enter this piece. Midway in the construction, a video projection was played, of boys and girls \u2014 punks \u2014 gathered in the open. They hang out, smoke cigarettes, drink beer, talk. At intervals, this behaviour is punctuated by involun- tary movements: facial muscles are forced into animalistic grimaces, or sudden eruptions like swinging a rattle in the air. These acts alternate with sessions in which they undress, trade clothes, and get dressed once more, putting on pants and sweaters that do not exactly fit. Thinking about this work, it seems as if different patterns of behaviour are thrown into the mix, merging the everyday with the primitive that is still part of our lives. At the time, muffled sounds reached your ear from behind the projection screen: the youngsters were really there! ( )-: HumaTiCks of the Present :-[ ], an act by Arthur Elsenaar at the 1994 Festival a/d Werf, is a second example. Elsenaar presented his playful piece around Neude Square in Utrecht, in the midst of relaxed festival visitors. His act featured five characters with mechanised bodies that reacted to sound. When these people were, for example, spoken to, they automatically made a pre-script- ed movement. This was put in motion via an electrode that, fixed to a part of their body, sent surges to mus- cles. These involuntary movements could be read as strong emotions. There was a lady who turned her head coquettishly to one side. A girl threw her head back in a strong air of haughtiness. A third one, looking like a rogue, raised his arm in a jovial ges- ture, giving you a big wink. On the last evening of the festival, the five characters came together on stage. Next I will mention a work by Pierre Huyghe that was recently presented in Paris. Dubbing (1995) consisted of a large projection of an event where around twenty people are watching a film that we cannot see but the dialogue of which is made visible through typed words at the bottom of the screen. Huyghe in- structed the spectators of the film to replicate the texts said by the actors. When one watches this work, one sees an unusual scene of a gradual shift from the formless \u2014 people who don't make contact \u2014 to a portrait of a group who accomplish a task. I found this work impressive. In a playful way, it persuaded you to become optimistic about the things people can do together! Compagnie de compagnie ( Company of company), an art project by Alicia Framis for Festival a/d Werf in 1996, was a functional agency. In the hall of the main train station in Utrecht, a yellow kiosk was set up. Here, a service was put on offer. Festival visitors could be accompa- nied by a pair of twins \u2014 identical twins were in ancient times the bringers of good fortune! \u2014 young men and women, on their way to a festival event. On their walks in the city, the festival visitors would not be alone. What most people probably 19 Mark Kremer264saw when approaching the kiosk was a portrait of beautiful twins. Perhaps the illusion of this work was the strongest feature! It reminds me of the spirit of the twentieth- century avant-garde, artists who saw their work as a tool to add beauty to everyday life. My final example is Aernout Mik's contribution to the catalogue of the 1995 exhibition Wild Walls, held at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. It consists of two pho- tos of museum guards sitting on the floor amid a constellation of scat- tered sugar cubes. Silly and unusual acts, guards who leave their role behind, freedom and anarchy! Gestures, expressions, and body language, human encounters: the works of today's artists play them back as real projections (or mirag- es). Sometimes an image is literally triggered through mechanical or electrical devices. At surface value, these images inform us about the \"human project\" \u2014 in ways that resemble Dan Graham's perfor - mance. Like Graham in his piece, these artists conjure up a group portrait. But instead of dissecting it, they show it tongue-in-cheek, an ideal undermined by irony. 7. Maybe it's possible now, despite the limited number of works I've talked about, to answer the question I asked at the outset. What is the connection between performances of the 1970s and current performance-related art (and tableaux vivants)? I have discussed the repetition of histor - ical acts, in terms of somatic re- enactment (the \" Stockholm boys\"), conscious tribute to a tradition (Janine Antoni and the feminist heritage of performance art), and as a bridge to a past that may seem lost sometimes (Dennis Bellone with respect to Joseph Beuys). I have also discussed other performance-related works. In my view, this work embodies not a spectacularisation of 1960s and '70s art but rather an at times lucid revision of a historical critical potential. I doubt if the connection of today's \"performances\" to that historical art comes from a similar interest of the artists in context, process, and politics. It seems as if these terms are more related to the past than to the present. What does seems crucial to me is that, today, artists are gauging the element of modern anxiety. Already the early performers did this in their solitary actions. But in their approach, a heavy heart was beating! Today's younger artists also expose problems of our era, but in the company of the suppressed laughter of the modern era, as the Russian literary theorist Mikhail Bakhtin called it. Hence in their work, a light tone prevails. They simply allow the problems to enter and take over their works, with a smile on their face. 265 Postscript, Summer 2020 Strange, this encounter with the real ... But, I am always someone else! After twenty-three years, I meet an author who is confused about his role. Art historian, story - teller, or art critic? This text presents an argument, or rather a question. It takes some detours, yes, it has some shortcomings. Yet, between the lines I feel the heart of a person who is enchanted by art! In 1997 , I was an instructor in the Curatorial Programme at De Appel in Amsterdam, passing on knowledge, finding my way as to how to connect with young people. In this text, I miss artists' thoughts. At the time, I could have asked \"my artists\" about the early performers \u2014 as curator of Festival a/d Werf, I had easy access \u2014 integrating their ideas into my meditation. Apparently I preferred the distance ... Did I want to keep my enchantment intact? Ulay's performance still touches me. Ulay died this year, in March. His act makes me feel real urgency. For him, performance art was stone dead. He had to animate dead matter before he could do what he did. Funny that the subtext of his title escaped me at the time. Der Begeisterer (The animator) is of course a variation on a Hollywood fixture: The Terminator (1984). One year after this talk, in 1998, I was teaching the workshop \"Urban Angst\" at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy. Christian Andersson was one of its participators. At the end of the course he realised a per - formance in which he sat down in a glass box positioned in a corridor of the school. It was the type of glass used in police interrogation rooms. He could not see his specta- tors. But we could see him. It was a beautiful and terrifying sight. A man was looking at the world, without seeing us, in his eyes all the signs of expectation and vulnerability.19 Mark Kremer2661 Benjamin H. D.

Past Tense (2020) Spend five or six years at an art academy. Make sure it's a small one, with an international profile. Eat everything served to you, and demand more. Work with materials and ideas that surprise you, when possible. Listen to everyone, to everything. A multitude of critical voices are there for your enjoyment and progress. Love them all. Start your education when the school is young. Follow its development, be a part of it, and contribute when you can. Be angry if you have to, take every chance to be happy. If you develop schizophrenia, Malm\u00f6 Art Academy will help you manage. If you are beaten and raped, Malm\u00f6 Art Academy will offer you opportunities to heal in ways local psychiatric care cannot. Do not adapt. Do not conform. Enjoy every angle, every statement, every piece of advice. Make friends for life. Travel with them to Mexico City and visit the Museo Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda. Harvest delight in possibilities given to you that you never thought reachable. Make art. Make things happen. Leave school at an appropriate time. Remember and nourish. Build life and work. Cook your friends a nice meal. Be happy. Leif Holmstrand2702. De Profundis, or From Above (2020) See to it that the lighting has a friendly and inviting quality. It should also change, slowly, but never stop signalling safety and care. Be many performers. Be different. Surround a seated audience, but keep a respectful distance and be as nice as you can in this situation. Make sure the seated audience has a large amount of comfortable, old, dark pieces of furniture to inhabit, and a large number of red, pink, orange, and yellow pillows at hand. Wear pastel\u00adcoloured veils over your bodies, wear green panties with different details and nothing else but lovely, fabulous black shoes and long black gloves. Move like slow animals at the intersection of insect\u00admammal. Concentrate on the difference between scent and smell for a while, continue the exploration of movement, and during these moves and relocations, each performer will add something personal to the growing odorama landscape, one by one. It could be perfume drops, the unpacking of lilies, the releasing of bakery loveliness, whatever. Ask the audience where they draw the line between scent and smell, and reassure them that it is all right to like both. Welcome answers and other phrases as they appear, and maybe repeat them, yes, repeat them. Let in a lot of fresh air, and a lot of outside sounds; reset the event. Drain the odorama room and state that the imagined smell / scent of cookies and incense lingering in the hole, in the naughty absence of a loved one, precedes a soon\u00adto\u00adbe return and reunion, a new kind of meeting and forging, the reversed little flower catastrophe, something within everyone's timeline and attention span, within everyday life of life, nothing special. There's a bakery in Shinjuku called the Smell of Scandinavia, and now is a good time to enlighten the audience concerning this central issue. Tell them to go there and touch each other, to sniff. 271Let's all go there and touch each other, and sniff, because we want to, and because we have to. I am not only a fruit of knowledge. I am bread. I am oatmeal in fat, sweet milk. I am all non\u00adfruit, through and through. But other things will always call for our attention. An apple straight from the tree is not a bad thing. Taste my juicy sinful apple tears of joy. Drink, friend, and I will drink from you. Distance was never an issue. Let everyone know that distance was never an issue, and that it never will be. But keep all bodies apart, be very strict about this, maybe with black\u00adand\u00adwhite string, maybe with police barricades and large branches picked from the ground of the closest forest. Say something about distance not being an issue because relation is humanity, air is humanity. Which is true and true nonsense. Never speak in full sentences, but try not to deliver fragments in a staccato fashion either; be softer and friendlier than that. Focus on air and breathing. Ask many times if anyone would like to sing a refrain or a verse from a favourite song, or just a song they happen to remember. Try to sing along, but in a more monotonous and chanting way. Ask to hear the song fragments again and again. Learn the words. Chant and conjure. Breathe each other's air while moving in slow motion, breathe slowly and carefully from greater and greater distances. Don't forget to behave like slow insect\u00admammals. Switch places with the audience, but let people, tell people, to bring all pillows out onto the open floor and sit on them, or hold them, or both. Continue not resembling humans. Climb furniture, rearrange furniture, while all performers speak, sing, and chant what they have learned, in overlapping fragments. Remember that you are insects, mammals, something in between. Let the singing and chanting slowly turn into insect and animal sounds while climbing and rearranging in more and more complex patterns. Strike beautiful poses from time to time.20 Leif Holmstrand272Make place for a naive attempt at art, full of shadows of gnomes and elves, dancing in the clearing. Pull out containers or taped plastic bags with pastel\u00adcoloured paint, many different kinds, from the undersides or insides of furniture. Make sure beforehand that the paint is water based and doesn't have any heavy smells or scents. A surprising kiss among the climbers will now surprise you all while everything becomes surprisingly darker in a surprisingly soothing way, darkness is not evil, care can embrace someone like you during the night as well as during the daytime, you'll be holding on to these plastic flower organs with paint or pastel seeds from very distant species and you'll be spreading the joy. Warm laundry enters from above, lands between the audience and the performers. Mostly white duvets, white sheets, and white pillowcases. See to it that the audience fills all duvets and pillowcases with all the pillows, and see to it that the audience throws the sheets and stuffed duvets and stuffed pillowcases on the furniture pile you inhabit and crawl upon. Make them put the police barricades and the branches and the black\u00adand\u00adwhite separating string there as well. A warm day in an urban park, as the sun goes down, appears with ease. Choose a medium for this impression or a magic trick with care. Also for the following: A fox scurrying through a gay district. Three alien spaceships landing and the disembarking visitors bringing us thoughtful gifts. Two gentle and uneven winds blowing from two clear lakes through dense forests, making the veils you are wearing move from side to side in an enchanting way. It is very important that you never stand still. The soft afterglow of the morning after a party will now arrive. Signal this feeling. And puncture some of the paint bags. Move, climb, sing, chant, talk. Spread paint. A tangled system of roots will appear, maybe it was hidden under the scenography, maybe even under the floor, and it will make it possible for you to attach all the pieces of furniture and the other things to each 273other, to let the roots root, to secure the structure and make climbing safer. The roots may be of any practical and available material, dirt coloured, soil coloured, terra di Sienna, raw or burnt umber. Mulled wine will be served around this time, and a very worn\u00adout tarot deck (Rider\u00adWaite) will be handed out, card by card, while more and more bags of paint are punctured and carried around over the secured, root\u00adbound mountain of furniture and sheets and stuffed duvets and stuffed pillowcases\u2014and so on. The paint must also come upon yourselves. Your voices must be heard. A nice cup of tea will follow, many of them, and palm trees will be reported being seen at night, lit by the flickering, from\u00addown\u00adunder rising, fluorescent, rainforest mushroom light. Yes. Voices as light from below. No more pain in the voices from below. Voices as candle eye\u00adlights travelling through the palm tree driblets of glitter\u00adhoney, through all the colourful veils of yours, through furniture, shoes, panties, through all uttered words or insect sounds or animal sounds. You will be more and more quiet, more and more still, you will make yourselves comfortable and be quiet and still, fully quiet and fully still, and cinnamon and cardamom powder will fall from the ceiling while the upward\u00adstriving lights disappear. This special kind of light will have moved on, gone further, up from this place, this stage, setting, scenery, and a pleasant everyday sunshine will take its place. Now, pay your respects, say goodbye, and wave.20 Leif Holmstrand2743.

When you come up the mountain, and you can see the small village at the top, turn right on the small gravel road. After walking for about five to ten minutes, you will come across a small opening between the trees where stones have been placed. This is the entrance. You are entering sacred ground, composed by Fran\u00e7oise, who was enlightened and then follow the calling, which was giving to her. Karin Hald2020278279 21 Karin Hald2802812. The first thing you will see on the land is a stone bed, approximately seven by seven metres, made out of rocks of roughly the same size. Walk in the direction from which you entered over the rocks, as slowly as possible. For every metre, think of a chakra in your body\u2014the first metre = the first chakra, and so forth. Connect your body as a line between earth and sky. 21 Karin Hald282283 21 Karin Hald2842853. Walk down over the grounds, past the stone house on the right. Find the place where large, almost white rocks have been dug out from the ground. Fran\u00e7oise will have placed a large white cloth for you to lie down on and placed a small, white cloth to cover your eyes. Meditate on the experience of being with and on rocks, while your internal gaze is turned towards the sky. Stay until you have an epiphany and/or you dissolve the idea of the dichotomy between you and the rocks. 21 Karin Hald286287 21 Karin Hald2882894. Follow the cairns that lead you left on the path around the house and out of the grounds. Build your own cairn if you feel like it. Pick up a small rock, put it in your pocket, and walk home. 21 Karin Hald290291 21 Karin Hald293Under Pressure1 Ute Meta Bauer 22 This text was first published in, Art School (Propositions for the 21st Century), edited by Steven Henry Madoff (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 2009). Reprinted by permission of the publisher and author. Art schools and university studio art programs, previously free and open zones for experiments, have found themselves pulled further and further into the orbit of the art market. Art students have more knowl\u00ad edge of the market than ever before, and to \"create\" successful artists\u2014which largely suggests commercial success as a career artist\u2014has become a standard promise read in almost every mission statement and call for applications by MFA programs not only in the United States but around the world. What may be more specific to the situation in the US is the very short route from the art school to the gallery to the collector's walls. This may be the case in London too, but the very high tuition fees in the US put a certain pressure to succeed on both the institution and the student. Today's strong market has made art 2009 Ute Meta Bauer294education red hot and an increasingly attractive field within education\u2014and not only MFAs. In the expanding market of the culture industry, critical studies, curatorial studies, MAs in public art, and PhDs in artistic produc\u00ad tion have either been recently invented or have risen to new popularity. (The inevitable cooling, and just as inevitable reheating, of the market is not likely to cause the institutional structure to regress.) This isn't in itself bad. The proliferation of these new, specialised programs interrupts the dominance of hundreds of years of the European master schools tradition that was established to select and form \"the best.\" Or this would seem to be the case. A question that immediately arises is whether the influence of the market is inducing a different uniformity. Of course, another question to ask is where all of these art students are going to go when they leave their alma mater with a degree in their pocket. As part of the selection process for a specific degree program, if you intend to invest so much in your art education, you want to know where the revenue will come from when you are finished with school and out in the world. But the pressure isn't only on the students. The pressure is on the art schools and programs to connect early with the art market and generate a smooth entry into the system while young artists are still under the school's umbrella. That is a major shift from even a decade ago. The debate then was about what that majority of art students would do who never reach the first stage of the magic \"success\" triangle of academy\u00adgallery\u00ad museum. But with the globalisation of the market, the boom in biennials and art fairs around the world, and the rapid expansion of a new generation of collectors, the chance to catch a ride on the art carousel has increased enormously. The ambition to pass through the gate and gain access to this field of distinction for larger and larger numbers of fledgling artists has become a reality. There are more exhibitions taking place, more art institutions with their doors wide open, more new museums and Kunsthalles being founded, and more private collections welcoming the public than ever before. But was this what art students 295and young artists were after, say, twenty\u00adfive years ago, when they asked for more visibility as they addressed the exclusive politics of major art institutions? Today it feels as if the art market has replaced the music industry, with its annual top\u00adof\u00adthe\u00adpops and one\u00adhit wonders. And although I appreciate the demo\u00ad cratic component that almost everyone can be a producer of some kind today, I am not so sure that this is a good thing. If the art market now seems more integrated into the educational system than ever before, we have to ask what its far\u00adflung biennials and fairs are providing. It is important to support access to discourse and to modes of production that we now find spread all over the world, just as I still believe that artistic practice is a critical contribution to the formation of societies. But the market embraces each new spot that pops up on the global map all too fast. Yesterday it was China, today it is India, and tomorrow Dubai and the Gulf. Who knows what it will be a year or two from now? And as much as I support this expansion of respect for and acceptance of artistic production in all parts of the world, the question is the degree of disciplined analysis, of filtering and criticality that this expansion has lacked. Instead of this, art has simply become a huge operating machine in need of skilled and \"educated\" labour \u2014a neocolonialist approach that takes advantage of postcolonial ambitions. This brings us back to art schools. Before the incursion of the market, art schools could still more easily be testing grounds for experimentation and inno\u00ad vation, including failure. But are they still places where you can discuss the meaning of artistic production within the larger field of culture, or, perhaps more precisely, debate what culture is today in such a globally expanded field of experience and how art schools have adapted to this fact? But have they indeed? And given this contested space of authority, can art schools truly help to negotiate and problematise what role art and its institutional apparatus play in our globalised and com\u00ad modified societies? It seems, on the one hand, that art students are allowed to do whatever they have in mind. Yet, what they have in mind is increasingly shaped, if 22 Ute Meta Bauer296not dictated, by the allure of success in the market, which is to say that the wild growth of experiment is more and more subject to the biotope of uniformity that the market enforces. Perhaps this was always there\u2014the same when a \"master\" taught his novices skills, tech\u00ad niques, and his own style as, today, when the market en\u00ad forces its own means of determining quality, techniques, and styles. But isn't it even more so now, with the endless output of colours, forms, two\u00addimensional works, voluminous installations, sparkling pixels, and the offer of so many diverse topics to fulfil the demands and desires of an \"educated\" consumer society that wishes to express its \"fine distinction\"? Under these pressures, art students and art schools seem to be without any useful, utopian naivete. All kinds of strategies are incorporated to serve our post\u00ad naive system. Perhaps the most flagrant is the end\u00adof\u00ad term \"open studio,\" which is advertised as an event that courts art dealers and collectors, replacing critics and curators, the global players of the 1990s. This is the reciprocity between the market and the academy. As art events have become part of the lifestyle, with substantial cash flow involved, there are huge demands for fresh artists, young curators, new terrains for biennials, galleries, and so on and so forth. It may feel as exciting as Paris showrooms during Fashion Week, but the question that we as educators and intellectuals need to address is what this reciprocity actually creates. In his article \"Bureaux de change,\" curator Alex Farquharson addresses \"new institutionalism,\" referring to the number of high\u00adprofile freelance curators who have joined the \"safe haven\" of institutions for higher artistic education.2 I don't necessarily agree with his argument. To me there is no outside of the institution, no outside of the art market, and vice versa. The market is part of the discursive field, as educational institutions are too. The art world is and always has been a complex system, a field of constellations and interrelations; some are friendly to each other, some are of a more antagonistic nature. Traditionally, the critical field has distinguished itself from the commercial sector, but 297the field has changed. These are not fixed configurations. Roles shift. The market brings both uniformity and proliferation, which means the opportunity for actors to decide on the coordinates of the positions and the directions in which they'll move. Indeed, institutions today represent far more positions than they did twenty\u00ad five years ago, because they have to address and attract a more diverse audience, if not many audiences. When Farquharson brings up the topic of curators flirting with educational institutions, this too is not about an outside and an inside but about the shifting fields of education and commerce in relation to one another\u2014and the larger effects brought into clear play. The commod\u00ad ification rampant in the art world has made it more difficult for curators to act within institutions as creative agents. It is the same for museum and Kunsthalle directors today, who are more occupied with manage\u00ad ment and fundraising activities than with working on shows or working directly with artists, as has been the case in the past. I do not want to criticise my colleagues in art institutions, but I want to express (and this I share with a number of my peers) a strong feeling of unease about the economic and political pressures that museum directors and curators increasingly face. And while art schools currently face the influence of the marketplace more strongly, by comparison they still seem to offer a kind of temporary refuge for those who want to sustain a more critical and discursive practice. This doesn't mean that the migration into the art school environment that we see at the moment is simply a means of escape. The opposite could be said as well: that art students are getting ever more prepared for \"real life\" by professionals in the field, such as curators and critics. But the potential and pleasure of working with students and doing research in related fields shouldn't be underestimated either. My own motivation for shifting from my original training as an artist and stage designer to my practice as a curator and educator already seems dated. The exclusion of a younger generation of artists, specifically female, from mainstream art institutions in the 1980s was a motor for me and for my artist friends to generate something else. We were not completely 22 Ute Meta Bauer298opposed to art institutions, but there was no space avail\u00ad able for us, and what we saw exhibited often failed to address what mattered to us or to our discussions about art. Instead of complaining about this situation, we simply created our own formats and spaces, generating our own audiences\u2014a typical do\u00adit\u00adyourself approach. We descended not only from visual arts but also from the fields of performance and theatre, film, music, and poetry. Today, with so much interdisciplinarity and the greater (though still unequal) acceptance of women in the art world, this seems far away. It was not until later that I understood that art history isn't made in the garage; the art historical canon is to a certain extent still in the hands of the major museums (and their trustees), based on what they choose to collect, exhibit, and publish. But more and more, the market dictates what kind of art is produced and shown in art institutions, and the rapaciousness of its desire for the new discourages memory and deep criticality, while addressing cultural diversity and gender only in its search for novelty. Price and collecting prestige invent new types of segregation. There is a need for serious debate within universities and other social institutions to focus on these issues in order to understand the major implications of this de\u00ad velopment. But for obvious reasons, those debates should also take place at art museums and at opinion\u00adcreating blockbusters like documenta (in Kassel, Germany); the biennials in Venice, S\u00e3o Paulo, Sydney, and New York (the Whitney); and the Carnegie International (in Pittsburgh). Especially at these places. They have the budgets, infrastructures, and media power to \"correct\" and rewrite art history, as they are the events at which the critics and opinion makers show up in vast numbers. But are we seeing these sorts of debates take place at these venues? Perhaps informally, but rarely as part of a regular public platform. A network of institutions addressing these issues would be of huge benefit. And closer to my main subject, what we need to see more in art schools is the development of alternative cultural stances to the predilections and short\u00adterm memory of the market. 299 I see my own teaching in art schools as a practice in line with curatorial work. The BBC's founding phrase, \"Education, Information, Entertainment,\" is a healthy mix that is still a valid model. The relation between art and exhibitions, which offers the option to test situations and combinations and explore thoughts through works of art, is no less needed as a focus in art education. An exhibition is equal to a seminar for me; both formats produce a communicative space through artistic and intellectual means. Nothing is wrong with the involve\u00ad ment of students in exhibitions, but the idea behind such participation has to be made clear. It shouldn't be to create a showcase for students entering the market, or certainly not that alone. When I studied art, being unpredictable was enough to prevent my fellow students and me from getting co\u00adopted. I must have internalised this attitude, and in any case we were far from having a master plan to develop and manage our careers. Of course, it's also important to remember the practical lessons of any number of conceptual artists, such as Hans Haacke at the Cooper Union in New York and Michael Asher at the California Institute of the Arts, who were able to sustain their in dependence throughout the pressures of previous market booms because of the independence that their teaching positions provided. For a female artist, often the only way to survive was to become a teacher. Of course, this isn't only about financial independ\u00ad ence from the market. This is about the possibility and responsibility to transmit a specific notion of a critical artistic and cultural practice to a younger generation of artists, while giving teachers the distance necessary to remain cognisant of the market but not in thrall to it. As a curator within the academy, I'm always trying to find company to explore, discover, reflect, analyse, and share what I perceive in order to implement a correction through a multitude of voices\u2014which is precisely what a curator does in the selection of works for an exhibition. Alongside the pressure to produce \"successful\" artists, the pressure has to remain to support the development of critical subjects. 22 Ute Meta Bauer300 This understanding, this continual generation of a public, communicative space within an institution for education , is still important to me. But the more the market encroaches, the more difficult this is to achieve. Perhaps to a certain degree this has been caused by curators entering the teaching field, bringing the dynam\u00ad ics of the market along with them. But it is clear that the fact of the omnipresence of the market means that art schools need to work on new ways of configuring and positioning themselves. Just as we have begun to see biennials reformulated as art schools, we must think about inverting this outside and inside of the market and the academy and think of a reverse practice that uses art fairs and the market more emphatically as educational tools and as the terrain for (counter)actions. Of course, it is also true that other possibilities remain if we take a longer historical view. The idea of making ephemeral and process\u00adoriented work that cannot be absorbed so easily by the market still exists within the academy. Dada, lettrism, and the Situationist Inter\u00ad national, land art, arte povera, Fluxus, and conceptual\u00ad ism have all been artistic movements that, at least at first, couldn't easily be swallowed by the art market and its consumers. New art will undoubtedly offer new possibilities of resistance, while the equal challenge remains to find ways in which what is useful about market thinking can be incorporated into art education and artistic practice. And while the market's influence is in the ascent now, this is a perishable fruit\u2014just as it has previously been the case that art historians, critics, and curators have each taken their turns as influencers. We have seen the same situation within the academy as it took up theoretical positions on colonialism and postcolonialism, gender, and class. They have all been great engines of debate and then have been pulled into the curriculum and disappeared through the back door of esteem, smelling too much of (necessary) political correctness, of doing good rather than thinking freely and widening our perspectives. Is it still possible to believe, as the political theorist Antonio Gramsci did, in the artist as an organic intellec\u00ad tual whose role is not to act subordinate but to be 301a critically independent voice that negotiates civil society? In some ways. But it is most important to not fall into the trap of considering any of the art world's players or institutions as fixed entities. This constant flux, this shift of what outside and inside even are, makes it possible to open up a space in education for rethinking values and judgements and to develop new critical practices. The biggest challenge may not be the pressure of the art market, but the willingness of the academy to challenge itself. 1 This essay does not address the curricula of BA, MA, or MFA degrees, nor is it a reflection on art education per se. Instead, it is my comment on recent developments that affect artistic education.

Pascal Gielen and Paul De Bruyne (Amsterdam: Valiz, 2011). Reprinted by permission of the publisher and author. 2011 The invitation to write about art teaching made me think, which is almost invariably a good thing. I have some thirty-five years of work experience, much of it related to pedagogy in some sense, if only because I have always, in all the roles I have assumed, had to address other people in a clear, lively, and thought-provoking way. I have had many opportunities to reflect on the pros and cons of what is commonly referred to as \"communication\" and \"mediation. \" These activities are problematic, I find, because they too often use language in predictable and flattening ways and therefore suspend the curiosity and unfettered thinking they were supposed to promote. But here I will look more specifically at my experience of teaching and what it might teach us. Since the mid-1980s I have made my living in the following fields, in roughly chronological order: language teaching at university level; art mediation in a conservative art museum; translating and inter - preting in a foreign policy environ- ment; cultural diplomacy and arts administration for an international organisation; freelance curating of small and large contemporary art exhibitions; freelance writing about art and related topics for catalogues and journals; freelance lecturing, moderating, and translating and book editing in a contemporary art environment; academic research on curating; teaching curatorial practice and art theory; institutional curating in a kunsthalle; academic administration; teaching fine art studio practice; institutional curating Anders Kreuger304in a medium- sized contemporary art museum; directing a small private kunsthalle. My trajectory is not an unbroken line of ascent or descent, nor is it a haphazard zigzag. At least that is how it looks to me now. It all started with a strong interest in art, language, and history, which made me study art history, political science, comparative linguistics, and modern languages (Lithuanian, Russian, and Finnish) at Stockholm University. I have travelled in different directions with this luggage, and I have been able to convert all my objects of study into action and results in the different chapters of my professional biography. So many of my curator colleagues have similarly speckled backgrounds that I rarely have to defend or even explain mine. One of the greatest attractions of working in contemporary art, I have always thought, is that it accommodates such a great variety of interests. More than most other fields, con- temporary art allows for a generalist approach. At the same time, of course, the art world is a highly specialised context. This balancing between the open and the closed also has implications for teaching art. Teaching The first time I was asked to teach I was still a student. For two years, I had been the only student of my unusual subject. Lithuanian is a notoriously difficult language, and because of my two teachers' almost total lack of interest in the process and protocol of learning, I had to find my own way through a thicket of obtusely formulated grammatical rules, which had to be extrapolated from hard-to-find books. How in- spiring, how emancipating, to be left to one's own devices like that! This was my first encounter with non-pedagogy after twelve years of well-intended but overly pedagogical schooling.1 Some other people wanted to start with Lithuanian in September 1986, and I was put in charge of them, since no one else could or wanted to do the job. I was already a convert to the non-method of \"theoretical\" philological study, as opposed to the drip-feeding of \"practical\" knowledge that was, and still is, the pedagogical norm for learning a new language. I decided that going through the textbook chapter by chapter was fine, but only after I had given my students an outline of the basic construction of Lithuanian and its meaning in a global linguistic perspective. This sounds ambitious, and it was, but my seem- ingly counterintuitive undertaking to base the first month of teaching entirely on my own hand-drawn illustrative plates of the language's deep structure proved reasonably successful. The usefulness of these posters strengthened my resolve to treat theory as the foundation for practice, rather than vice versa. They also showed me that almost anything could be visualised without oversimplification, which was a good reminder of the need for precision in teaching.305 After doing things more or less directly related to politics for more than ten years, I found myself teaching again in the early 2000s. I had just assumed a new identity, that of the freelance curator, and besides getting my first commissions for exhibitions and essays, I was getting invitations to give occasional lectures in Scandinavian art acade- mies. As a matter of both principle and convenience, I would speak only on subjects that intrigued me at the time. This simple rule is, I have found, also true of institutional programming: do not try to guess what interests other people; try instead to share your own interests with them. I lectured, for instance, on the topic of \"contemporary bureaucracy as art\" at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, on \"the unfinished sentence\" at the Royal University College of Art in Stockholm, and on Walter Benjamin's phrase \"to read what was never written\" at the Finnish Academy of Fine Arts in Helsinki.2 Obviously, preparing for such lectures helped me to shape and deepen my own reading practice and curatorial research. The next stage in my develop- ment as a teacher was when I was invited by some of the same academies as well as others, like the Royal Academy of Fine Art in Copenhagen and the Trondheim Academy of Fine Art, to give week- long seminars. I developed yet another non- pedagogical method (or perhaps it was a pedagogical non-method): reading original texts aloud to students, with frequent breaks for explanation and commen- tary, rather than offering \"applied\" versions of Walter Benjamin, Gilles Deleuze, Hannah Arendt, Martin Heidegger, Sigmund Freud, and Henri Bergson (these were the authors I focused on in 2002 - 07). I am not ranting, but simply stating a fact, when I note that young people's reading skills have changed since the mid-1980s, when I was a student. It is partly to do with a general decline in teaching arts and letters at school, but more significantly with the institutionalisa- tion of the short attention span due to clickable hypertext and real-time online feedback. Urbane, intelligent art students know better than to lose time with books when they are alone in the studio or at home, where they cannot immediately weave their newfound knowledge into a social web involving their peers, a figure of authority, and the collectively sustained sense of possible future gain. This is unsurprising. Like most people today, art students need to feel secure that what they are doing is important, and preferably all the time. They have been taught that knowledge is useless unless you can use it. Curiosity for curiosity's sake is something many of them have \"unlearned\" (a too fashionable word, but appropriate in this context). The reading seminar without homework is one way of addressing this contemporary psychological reality. First, an adapted rendering of the concept of time as duration, or the idea that the past is preserved in the past, can never substitute the 23 Anders Kreuger306sheer intellectual shock and aesthetic pleasure that Bergson's concise and unpredictable verbal images offer us when we read them or listen to someone reading them to us. Second, the collective reading of The Life of the Mind, What Is Called Thinking?, or The Logic of Sensation becomes a performance.3 This is recognisable as an art format and therefore more pleasurable \u2014 and important \u2014 than an individual act of reading, which is associated with everything art students are supposed to be less good at: wrestling with language, following a thread from beginning to end ... Finally, the possi- bility to monitor whether the seminar participants actually understand the text is a crucial element of this pedagogical experiment. Explanatory digressions are an efficient tool if they are precise and well timed. Students of curating have an even shorter attention span than fine art students. At least that is what conventional wisdom tells us. They are even more focused on the instant gratification of converting knowledge into networking benefits or concrete results. Of course, there are different kinds of curating students and different kinds of study programmes. The MA in Curating Contemporary Art at the Royal College of Art (RCA) in London, where I taught in 2003-04, was at the time known for not neglecting the technical and social skills of exhibition making. I was called in to supervise a group of twelve graduating students as they were collectively putting togeth- er an exhibition and a documentary film programme, so I appreciated that they had been trained in the fundamentals of making things happen. I continued in the same fashion, giving small workshops on topics such as how to write letters to commercial galleries and how to edit an artist's CV, and I supervised the students as they renovated the rundown gallery spaces of the RCA. This methodology of learning by doing was, I thought, a suitable way to share my experience of being a curator. None of these four teaching roles \u2014 conveying synthesised insight into a complex system, formatting specific aspects of discourse into lectures, performing text for a small collective, and supervising a classic apprenticeship \u2014 was uncompli cated. They all required experimental approaches and solutions. Yet they were directly related to my own expertise as a philologist, writer, and exhibition curator. My latest \"proper\" teaching job, as Visiting External Lecturer at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy in 2010-11, was by far the most difficult and the most worthy of thought. How could I, as an active curator and writer and former administrator (I had been Director of this academy in 2007-10) use my own experience in the one-to-one studio conversation with a student who is becoming a practising visual artist? I, who do not define myself as an artist? What were my advan tages in this predicament? My disadvantages? Every studio visit is a delicate and sensitive situation. Work is 307underway, and the teacher is invited (always invited by the student, never inviting himself) to respond to it and to help steer the ongoing pro- cess. I decided to stay true to my non-pedagogical approach, making it clear to the students that I would always respond very directly to whatever they showed me, without censoring my impulse to verbalise what I saw or trying to make it fit into any \"learning strategy. \" But before I say more about my experi- ence of studio teaching, I will allow myself a few digressions. Curating First some very basic reflections. Having worked in a few different capacities, I have developed some attitudes that I think are suitable for all kinds of work. I always try to do things that are a little bit too difficult for me, to avoid getting bored and to make sure I keep learning new things. I have discovered, sometimes the hard way, that it may be good to put your own \"personality\" (which of course is forever changing and developing) into your work, but that it is bad to take your work personally. Getting angry with others, or really feeling sorry when you apologise for your mistakes, is rather unhelpful. And perhaps most pertinently: the result of your own work will always, if you are lucky, become material for someone else. It means that we should not be offended when others cannibalise our thoughts and misquote us for their own purposes. All these bits of self-help wisdom can be quite important to remember when you are teaching. My question to myself is: How I can best use my experiences as a curator in the studio visit situation? To answer it, I need to clarify, and at the same time complicate, how I view my profession. This is also known as \"problematising\" (an other sadly overused word). There are different approaches to curating, and curators usually subscribe to several of those in their practice. As we have seen, curating may be regarded as a technique or a set of skills that can be taught and learned: the things you need to know to make good exhibi- tions or be an efficient \"art mediator\" in other ways.4 Alternatively, it can be described as an attitude or aware- ness of quality or mark of cultural sophistication, which is more difficult to acquire through training. Such contemporary and highly specialised connoisseurship is, I sometimes suspect, the actual connotation of \"the curatorial, \" a recent coinage in the growing literature on curating. Curating is in fact increasingly recognised as a mode of operation reflecting what drives contemporary capitalism: the \"art of choosing. \"5 In an economy no longer character - ised by scarcity and need, knowing how to select from an abundance of offerings is what creates visibility and status. The good choice is perhaps the only act that consumerist society accepts as meaningful and \"person- al. \" Seen in this light, the curator's role as an arbiter of taste (a taste that aims to transcend the merely aesthetic and embrace the psycho-23 Anders Kreuger308logical, the social, and the political) is perfectly designed for a networked world that privileges the relational over the substantial and reference over interpretation. It is healthy to remind ourselves of another possible understanding of curating: as a mode of thinking that cannot function if it is too far removed from the practice of animat- ing objects and ideas (making them come alive in three-dimensional and social space) or if it excludes the other (the object, the author, the viewer) from its operations. This, in fact, is how the failure of exhibitions can often be explained: that the curator decided to do all the thinking himself, disregarding interesting things that did not fit with his \"con- cept. \" At the same time, practition- ers of curating must have enough confidence in its methods and goals to avoid reducing it to mediation. Rather than assuming the role of the go-between, the curator should aim to produce situations where people can think together. This was my tentative conclu- sion when I sat down to scrutinise curating some years ago, after being invited to submit a proposal for a biennial. I even entitled my exhibition outline \"Thinking Together. \" The start- ing point was a rather straightforward understanding of the phrase: that an exhibition is an event designed to bring people together to think rather than to \"do something. \" The \"think tank\" is sometimes brought up as a model for both exhibition making and academic research in visual art, with the motivation that a group of like-minded curators or doctoral can- didates working informally together will challenge each other's assump- tions and deliver more innovative results. Yet this analogy, inspiring as it is, will mislead us if we ignore the actual purpose and functioning of established think tanks. More often than not, these are ideologically and commercially motivated purveyors of partisan views for the political marketplace. We may want to play a curatorial game with the overtones of kitsch enthusiasm that resonate in \"thinking together, \"6 but do we really want contemporary art to make itself useful as a lobbying instrument? When I thought more about these two words, I remembered another way to connect and inter - pret them. They may point us in a direction that is less ambitious than a gathering of minds but perhaps more pregnant with meaning for the practice (and theory) of curating. People can think together, but things can also be thought together . In contemporary academia, the latter interpretation of thinking-together (the hyphen is optional) is gradually winning acceptance as an experi- mental methodology for combining various forms of knowledge into new speculative ensembles.7 This allows academic writers to look for unexpected similarities or analo- gies between seemingly disparate phenomena, which could be seen as a return to the foundational moment of comparative science (linguistics, archaeology, anthropology) in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The thinking-together of 309different thoughts is the equivalent of a comparison that deserves to be made even if we do not know what knowledge it might produce. The common practice of thinking-together is therefore no less ambitious than the utopian ideal of thinking together. The two can also be combined. I once failed in an interesting way when I wanted to do precisely this at an informal gathering, in Oslo, of artists and theoreticians. What I tried was to put an array of inspirations and inter - pretations \"on the table, \" so that my listeners might combine them into new constellations. I wanted them to do this \"together, \" which is never a self-evident activity. Together with me? Together as a group? It is diffi- cult either way, and might not even work. In a sense, the Oslo talk was a perfect illustration of the core diffi- culties of this proposition. Although I enhanced my lack of coherence with performative awkwardness, the presentation remained too open- ended, too scattered. Yet I believe that \"Thinking Together\" (my still unrealised exhibition plan) reveals a hidden need that should be made explicit and converted into concrete curatorial and pedagogical work. True to my non-method for teaching theory, I read out short passages from original texts that had helped me to configure a semantic field for my idea \u2014 a fuzzy set of meanings presenting a multidimen- sional mental image rather than a concise verbal definition.8 The most important of these sources are Gilles Deleuze's elusive notion of the \"noosign, \" or \"thinking image\";9 Jacques Ranci\u00e8re's no less ambigu- ous parsing of the \"pensive image\";10 and, above all, Pierre Teilhard de Chardin's overtly speculative but more accessible description of the \"noosphere, \" a \"sphere of thought\" postulated in analogy with the biosphere, or \"sphere of life. \"11 I find all of them very relevant for thinking about curating and, in the context of this essay, for thinking about teaching. It is perhaps paradoxical that I, who think of myself as an only moderately social person, should insist on speaking in such terms of \"togetherness\" and on trying to grasp what unites the connection of people with the connection of ideas. I do tend to avoid together - ness whenever I can, and particularly larger groups of people, but on the other hand I am also not interested in going it alone and thereby impos- ing my own attitudes on others. At least for now, before I have had time to over-elaborate my idea, I find it meaningful to identify curating as a mode of thinking that will not thrive in splendid and dictatorial isolation. It is this vision of the curator's role that I tried to carry over into my parallel activities as an art teacher. Teaching Art as a Curator Teaching studio practice to young aspiring artists offers a minimal mod- el for thinking together: the meeting of two individuals within the format of the educational studio visit. Yet it must be acknowledged that this is 23 Anders Kreuger310an abstract and idealised view of the institutional reality that constitutes life in the art academy. The two indi- viduals are under different kinds of pressure: one being weighed down with the task of turning the other into a student, the other saddled with the task of becoming an artist by using himself and others as material. On the one hand, there are good reasons why teachers should not fraternise with students. The effects on the microcosmic world of the academy might be devastating if things get too personal between the two categories. Intergenerational affairs are, as we all know, not unheard of, but I side with those who condemn them while the teacher- student relationship is still in place. While I was at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, I even decided to not accept any offers of Facebook friendship (a common ritual for expressing satisfaction with a lecture or a studio visit, and not a very personal act at all) until the counterpart had graduated from the Academy. On the other hand, Ranci\u00e8re's observation that the teaching situation produces ignorance in order to perpetuate itself is relevant also in the ostensibly democratic contemporary art acad- emy.12 The potentially emancipating educational studio visit is embedded in a hierarchical order that threatens to compromise it. It is always difficult to make thinking-together work when the parties to the situation are unequal. So there are some difficulties with the institutional framework and psychological realities of teaching fine art. Presumably, similar prob- lems occur across the whole edu- cational sector, but what makes the art academy particularly challenging is that it offers comparatively little curriculum-based education and in- stead focuses on students' individual processes of becoming-artist under the supervision of older and more accomplished colleagues. Such continuous personalised tutoring is the most important component of a degree in fine arts. Usually this is an affair between artists. Only those who are themselves practising (and successful) artists are entrusted with looking at, understanding, and responding to the work that is emerging in the studios. But surely there are also ways of making curators' knowledge useful to fine art students? First of all, curators must know how to put their experience of art into words. This is what \"mediation\" is all about. Good curators should be able to write concise and expressive prose, which is one way of converting functional mediation into something more creative and challenging. A clear and precise verbal response to students' work is important for the quality of the studio visit. Curators must also be good at gathering information, creating associative links across vast stretches of data and, crucially, retaining names and dates and other details that make communication more accurate and efficient. One important task for fine art teachers is to make students aware of the context of their work, to show them what has already been done: how, 311why, by whom, where, and when. I have often used the internet as a reference tool during studio visits, but for this I must be able to recall names and feed them into the search engine. I dare say that curators, in general, are better at this than artists. Name-dropping is simply part of the curatorial d\u00e9formation professionnelle. Finally, curators must always pay attention to the pragmatic details that can enhance art making, if stu- dents learn to master them. Thinking ahead about possible solutions for presentation is one way to trouble- shoot an idea. Both artists and cura- tors are skilled in this, but curators have the advantage of having worked with different artists who have dif- ferent needs. They are trained to see things from both inside and outside the individual artist's perspective. Curators participate in the production of art but are also detached from it. In my experience, one of the best questions to ask art students is: \"How would you yourself react if you were confronted with this work in an exhibition?\" This serves as an introduction to discussing the need for some basic clarity in the structure of a work. Art students are quite often anxious about showing work that is \"too obvious. \" While \"commu- nication\" may not be the purpose of art making (at least, I don't think it is), communication often contributes to the success or failure of a pres- entation. Curators who teach fine art should be uncompromising in their emphasis on critical seeing, but they should also unambiguously stress the importance of using language as a tool. When I was Director of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, I initiated a one-week workshop to address this issue of language and writing in relation to studio practice. I invited my experi- enced colleague Helena Holmberg, curator at Index in Stockholm, to teach it together with me. We decid- ed to call the workshop \"Curating for Artists\" and to focus on the notion of the \"art project\" (with its de- liberately \"logistical\" overtones) and to coach students in three different ways to use text: as part of a work (a vehicle for self-expression), in a project description (to attract interest and possible support for a project in the making), and in a press release (to advertise a finished project). We wanted the students to grasp the meaning and basic method of the \"functional\" writing that curators have to master, believing that prac- tising artists would also benefit from such skills.13 The workshop was part of the obligatory course package for second- year BFA students, along with a course in basic accounting and tax and copyright law and a workshop in grant application writing. Feedback from the participants was overwhelmingly positive (all courses at the Academy are evaluated in writing by the students), but after half a year or so I was already hearing complaints from faculty members. The students had, I heard, become too complacent about developing their studio practice and planning their BFA graduation essays, 23 Anders Kreuger312thinking that this had already been taken care of in the project descrip- tions Helena and I made them write for the workshop. The curatorial approach to \"projects, \" I also heard, was derailing the more insecure students who were struggling to develop their actual work. The gist of the critique against \"Curating for Artists\" was that it is unsuitable to teach the \"too instrumental\" curatorial approach to language when the process of becoming-artist is still in such a delicate stage. I accepted these objections as credible, because I knew that transferring the curator-artist relationship to the teaching situation would always be problematic and difficult, and as a result of discus- sions with faculty, the workshop was suspended. Yet in retrospect I believe that the risks were overstated, and that Helena and I were making a valid point with \"Curating for Artists. \" The mission of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, as I formulated it, was threefold: to educate new artists, to provide proper employment for accomplished artists, and to produce new knowledge. I maintain that new artists need to know not only how to produce work but also how to situate their work in the world at large so that it can be received as new knowledge. Now that I have withdrawn from the Academy and from teaching and instead meet younger artists in my capacity as a museum and kunsthalle curator, I am strengthened in my conviction that success comes to those who have both sets of skills. The main problem of the art academy, as I see it from my different vantage points, is that it too often becomes a power base in itself, serving the interests of those who operate within the academic system rather than the students or even the teachers. Too much of what the academy does to renew itself and be future oriented is actually to do with securing funding. This is, as far as I understand, true of the doctoral research programmes as well as of the international exchange projects, the special publishing projects, the high-flying seminars with invited guest speakers ... All this is fine and well, as long as the everyday routine of studio visits and technical and theoretical courses (these were the basic teaching formats at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy) are not allowed to fall into neglect. I am convinced that the art academy has the potential to be a site for the production of something new and for thinking-together in the two senses I have tried to elaborate. Therefore I resent it becoming a machine that turns potential partners for innovation into \"students\" or, even worse, into the \"pupils\" of the pre-Bologna tradition. I resent becoming authori- tarian in my role as a teacher, which is partly a result of pressure from \"the system\" and partly a tendency in my own personality that I have to resist. To strike the right balance between the professional and the personal is, I think, the challenge that makes teaching continuously interesting.313 Nevertheless, the reason I stopped teaching is simple: I no longer have enough time for it. When you are fully dedicated to institutional curating, everything you do should be geared towards creating a maximum of art world visibility for your institution and for yourself. Sadly, teaching does not do that; it is too long term and low key to register as a curatorial achievement. In this sense \"the system\" takes care to preserve a traditional division of labour between artists and curators. Teaching studio practice is a good career move for artists and less so for curators. Yet I hope that I will have the oppor - tunity, in the not-too-distant future, to take up this kind of teaching again, and to push it further into the territory of curating so that the studio visit really becomes an arena for thinking-together.23 Anders Kreuger3141 I have often thought of my encounter with the Department of Baltic and Slavic Languages at Stockholm University as a somewhat uncanny parallel to the interview, in the cellar of the university, with Dr. Uzzi-T uzii, professor of Bothno-Ugrian languages, in Italo Calvino's If on a Winter's Night a T raveler (on pages 51 - 58 in my copy of the Swedish translation by Viveca Melander, Om en vinternatt en resande (Stockholm: Bonniers, 1983)). After all, a three-week course in Old Prussian grammar and text fragments was part of the MA degree I earned in 1990 ... 2 This is an important phrase in Walter Benjamin's 1933 essay \"On the Mimetic Faculty. \" See Walter Benjamin, \"On the Mimetic Faculty, \" in One-Way Street, trans.

Glenn Gray (New Y ork: Perennial, 1976); Gilles Deleuze, Francis Bacon: The Logic of Sensation, trans. Daniel W. Smith (London: Continuum, 2003). 4 When this essay was first published, in 2011, I was employed by M HKA\u2014Museum of Contemporary Art Antwerp, as a \"presentation specialist. \" My colleagues from Romania tell me that a museum curator there is officially a muzeograf. 5 See Dorothea von Hantelmann, \"The Curatorial Paradigm, \" Exhibitionist, no. 4 (2011): 8. 6 By way of example, I will just mention William Isaacs's book Dialogue and the Art of Thinking T ogether: A Pioneering Approach to Communicating in Business and in Life (New Y ork: Bantam and Dell, 1999), and the working congress on the \" municipal transition system\" organised by the city of Cologne on June 3 - 4, 2008, under the title Zusammen denken, gemeinsam handeln (Thinking together, acting as one). 7 See, for example, Gordon G. Globus, Quantum Closures and Disclosures: Thinking-T ogether Postphenomenology and Quantum Brain Dynamics ( Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2003). Quantum brain dynamics in itself is a fine example of thinking-together. It was launched in the late 1960s when the Japanese physicist Hiroomi Umezawa first used quantum field theory to try and explain the sub-neuronal functioning of the human brain, and it has produced the intriguing theory that memory relies on non-localisable macroscopic quantum operations involving the quasi-crystalline behaviour of the brain's water molecules. 8 On this topic one of the best writers is Vasily Nalimov, a dissident Soviet philosopher of science whose grandfather was a Komi shaman: \"Thus, if human consciousness operates with fuzzy, probabilistically weighted sets of concepts, is it possible to introduce this system of concepts directly into our language? The experience of statisticians, representatives of the subjective probability inter - pretation, shows that it is extremely difficult, if at all possible, to extract from people prior, probabilistically given ideas of some familiar phenomenon. Though such fuzzy knowledge almost certainly exists, people for some reason or other will not, or perhaps cannot, transfer it to others. This barrier is erected by our culture: it is not customary to reveal the process of thinking; hence, communication goes on at the discrete level. \" Vasily Nalimov, Realms of the Unconscious: The Enchanted Frontier, trans. A.V. Y arkho (Philadelphia: ISI Press, 1982), 16.3159 Here is an important but typically nonexhaustive quote from Deleuze: \"The image had to free itself from sensory- motor links; it had to stop being action-image in order to become a pure optical, sound (and tactile) image. But the latter was not enough: it had to enter into relation with yet other forces, so that it could itself escape from a world of clich\u00e9s. It had to open up to powerful and direct revelations, those of the time-image, of the readable image and the thinking image. \" Gilles Deleuze, Cinema 2: The Time-Image, trans.

By exploring some forms of this resistance, I have sought to show that it is not a constitutive property of the nature of certain images, but a set of distances between several image functions present on the same surface. \" Jacques Ranci\u00e8re, \"The Pensive Image, \" in The Emancipated Spectator, trans.

I, for my part, can see only one explanation. It is that the enormous excess of free energy, released by the establishment of the Noosphere, is naturally, as a matter of evolution, destined to pass into the construction and functioning of what I have called its 'brain.' In this the Noosphere is similar to the organisms that preceded it. Humanity is progressively becoming 'brainier.' In order to fill what is called our leisure time, we must therefore devote it to new work of a higher nature. This is a biological necessity, and it leads to a general and collective effort of vision.

First published in the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy Yearbook 2006 - 2007. Republished by permission of the author.2007 After I was invited to develop this essay for a lecture at the Iceland Academy of Arts in Reykjav\u00edk in 2005 in the context of the sympo\u00ad sium What Kind of Art Academy Would Women Create? , I could not help but think about Leontine Sagan's M\u00e4dchen in Uniform (1931). It is a filmic saga about a Prussian boarding school run with disci\u00ad pline and order where only one of the all\u00adfemale staff\u2014the beautiful Fr\u00e4ulein von Bernburg\u2014shows some heart, thus causing the main character, a fourteen\u00adyear\u00adold girl, to fall in love with her. That thought of course made me smile, as I know that this was not that scenario that I was invited to address in the context of the conference. But my thought was in fact revealing to me a need to examine some of the propositions made by the title of this conference. I will obviously, and I admit de\u00ad liberately, put aside the symposium's founding motivations for now. I will \"One is like so many that one is not one, never one, always one of a number. One is one of many but not the same as any other, never the same, not exactly. One is peculiar, be both one thing and another, here and there, real and imaginary. Certainly one terminates. Everyone has an end. One falls everywhere, resting anywhere but one never keeps the same in the same place like the others. One simply does not have a choice. Rising one falls and collects. Dropping to gather, one changes, and one evaporates, and each one is constrained by the same gravity as any other.\" \u2014Gregg Bordowitz1 Andrea Geyer318get back to the palpable and also subtle discriminations in regard to gender in institutions that teach art, and even more so in the field of art (the art world at large) in a little while. For now, I will take a little detour, following some of the foundational questions that come along with the discussions of \"women's rights'\" and \"feminism.\" Of course I will only be able to touch on some, and even on those only lightly, within the frame of this paper. Nevertheless, what I will try to suggest is that it is these rather foundational questions that offer a productive space in the midst of an expansive debate. This is true specifically in the face of the insti\u00ad tutional celebration of feminism currently occurring in 2007, which seems to encourage a canonisation of a rather heterogeneous discourse. Why try to build a canon instead of creating the space that these debates actually still need\u2014or should I say, will inevitably need again and again.2 What Kind of Art Academy Would Women Create? This title implies that if an exclusive group of people specified as \"woman\" came together to create an alternate (oppositional?) system of education, the changes\u2014or better, the shift in education\u2014brought about by them would lie exclusively in the very identity of these actors as \"woman.\" It is this assertion\u2014liter\u00ad ally unfolded as such\u2014that I have difficulty in following, even in the hypothetical. Actually, I have to resist it. Not to claim a polemical opposition, but to actually move through what problems these assertions point to and why I will use them to start detours to what I personally think is at stake in terms of gender and education today, especially within the field of art. Any Act Should Assume Unified Terms to Get Started; or, What Happens When I Say \"Woman\" in a Classroom Today? Growing up in the 1970s with feminism already established as an \"institution,\" I was too young to be part of the identity politics of the early 1980s. I recognised the drive and the usefulness of the term and the identity of \"woman\" at that time. Yet I myself had found an understanding of gender (and therefore myself) in the discursive space of the late 1980s and early 1990s with different ideas on these categories, informed on the one side by Judith Butler's Gender Trouble (1990) and on the other by the challenging questions asked towards language by Monique Wittig in the Straight Mind (1992) and Denise Riley in Am I That Name? (1988). Of course, I was also living and working within an environment that had significantly changed since the first\u00adwave feminist struggles of the 1970s (and of course partly due to those struggles). I was confronting my gender identity 319as a contested site of identification in dialogue with being a recent settler to the United States and a white person in the American context of the Clinton era. So instead of embracing a pre\u00adscripted, even if politicised, identity that the generation before me had carved out, I needed to locate the path towards my right to be who I am. This struggle was at the same time deeply personal and also generation\u00ad al and intersectional, grounded in the present moment in which I was coming to terms with it. This personal experience points to the inevitable when I teach yet another generation of students: the students I work with at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and in the United States today need to reconcile and form their identity differently than I did. That means I have to be conscious and acknowl\u00ad edge the paths that my students are making in terms of their struggle for identity rights happening within yet another political environment \u2014one that I am of course also continuously responding to, but did not form my identity in relation to. I also recognise that they are making those paths now with the newly named and demarcated gender identities available to them. I understand the identities they attach themselves to, as well as those they create, as contextual, and never merely descriptive. It is through this understanding of the mobility of these identities that I recognise the impossibility and limits of language and terminology in the face of such complexities. But taking this into account not as a limit, but as a possibility, allows me to productively raise issues around discrimination based on gender in the present moment, for my students and for myself. The students and I in our respective multitudes of gendered beings together create and enact a community that has to be in its difference (not unity). It is from this place of community across difference that we can understand and discuss the formation of their identities as well as the oppression some experience based on their gender. Put simply: we need to acknowledge the fact that the students' conception of who they are in terms of gender is not necessarily that of the teachers, even if similar terminology is used. This is a process that needs to take its own generational and personal time, and it does not concur with lesson plans. What I have recognised is that, within feminism, each generation has to realise and locate its own particular place and need of struggle in terms of its identities. And only after that generation locates its path and the conditions that form it will some of that generation be compelled to relate themselves to larger histories of feminism\u2014never before. In acknowledging these different and shifting identities (including my own), the question for me has been: How do I work with those 24 Andrea Geyer320differing identities without slip\u00ad ping into relativism but rather find a thread, an alliance, and a form of organisation that relates, and therefore creates, a discussion across difference (without a desire to unify) that can challenge the dominant order without reinscribing reversed stereotypes or yet another form of hierarchy? For example, when using \"woman\" with students, I have to unfold the term, historically and ideologically. The term, in its ab\u00ad straction, is standing in for concepts in relation to different traditions of thoughts and different contextual interpolations. The word \"woman\" doesn't necessarily address every woman, female, queer, lesbian, trans man, or, more often than not, myself. This demonstrates that a system of language that describes the divided subject (man/woman) ontologically is not very useful and cannot be folded successfully into the identities at stake in the political struggles with which we are engaged today.3 To add to that is the fact that \"woman\" historically has shown itself to be a term that excludes. Working myself through these thoughts, it becomes clear that the point to start and work with when addressing discrimination based on gender in the classroom today is to ask: Who are the individuals that are patronised and discrimi\u00ad nated against within the inevitably patriarchal environment we work in? And I do that without naming them with any specific term. Then, from this place of experience and observation\u2014of being present to where I stand, to who my students are today, to who faculty and staff is\u2014I can start to identify structures within the institutional context that frames us that I would like to chal\u00ad lenge, resist, rewrite, and overcome. And I can start working collectively with those affected on how to do that work. What's Your Problem?; or, Don't We Live in a Post-feminist Area? I am very aware of and subjected to the discrimination that exists within the arts, within education, and beyond. This field of arts is funda\u00ad mentally structured along intersect\u00ad ing axes of gender, race, sexuality, class, ability, nationality, and age, to manifest different privileges and power. Starting from the recognition of individual art practice, visibility as a practising artist, and value, these discriminations affect the majority of practitioners, including professors, adjunct faculty, staff, and students at many art academies. This discrim\u00ad ination is a bleak fact, a tangible part of my professional life as an artist. But nevertheless, I find when addressing this fact in the classroom, it is treated by significant number of today's students as an urban legend. Because they assume that they are simply accepted as who they are. That structures of power offer a choice to participate or not. These 321students experience themselves to be above this kind of discrimination. They believe that this privileged position is theirs because of their own individual excellence, as artists who will and can exceed the con\u00ad finement of conventional labelling. They don't recognise (yet) that this position is a sign of their inherent privilege, which, if unreflected upon, sustains such discrimination. Discrimination based on race or gender can be a challenging issue to address in the classroom. It is messy, it triggers defensiveness, and in the art context it is often conflated with claims or dismissal of quality. When this topic is addressed by a female\u00adappearing professor, it can be read and disregarded as an older woman's \"bitterness\" and \"defen\u00ad siveness,\" caused by a personal lack of success. Another turn\u00adoff is that, once put forward as a condition or problem, there is not \"a\" solution: there is no simple list of things to do differently, and you also cannot escape it. Discrimination based on gender and race is a prevailing condition intertwined with other forms of discriminations. Maybe because of the above as a topic and as an actual practice, even among fellow artists feminism has become highly unfashionable to address or engage. Part of this also stems from the limitations of second\u00adwave feminism when it comes to gender nonconforming identities and the lack of consideration of the intersections of gender, ability, socioeconomic power, and race. There seems to be no end to sexisms in any case, and a confrontation with curators or gallerists or colleagues along its lines brings too much discomfort all around and so is considered not worth it\u2014a nuisance \u2014hitting closed minds. For the occasion of this lecture, I went out and did a little bit of fieldwork. I asked a group of fifteen students that I work with at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy, in Sweden, what they thought needed to be challenged around gender within education. Their answers did not surprise me. There was strong resistance to the term \"feminism,\" as it seemed to most of them to be a term that is historical and not useful today, because the female students did not feel discriminated against. See above. They believe that they are judged just and only on the quality of their work. Feminism, they said, simply prescribes for them to be victims and for others to be the predators, no matter how much the male students themselves felt bothered by the mainstream \"macho\" attitudes and values. Their spontaneous response to feminism was that it feminism in itself was discriminating against them. In one way or another, they all articulated that was actually feminism that was constantly rein\u00ad scribing a divide, and that that was not their experience. Feminism was keeping them hostage in stereo\u00ad types they felt utterly uncomfortable with. Another interesting outcome 24 Andrea Geyer322of this conversation was that there was a definite resistance from all students to the suggestion that they are in any way, consciously or unconsciously, complicit in any form of it. What I observed though, when asking them about their experiences in the art world, their lives at the academy, and their personal lives, is that they were experiencing discrimination continuously. But because of their self\u00adpositioning as beyond sexisms, and their con\u00ad sequent rejection of feminism as a political and social necessity, they lacked the language and tools to address the discrimination that they seemed to experience nevertheless. Their liberation from and rejection of the terms of feminism, I noted, left them at this point inarticulate in the face of their struggles, and therefore having trouble organising collectively against those sexisms. Given my conversation with my students, I have to ask: How can I work with terms like \"feminism,\" often already considered as an ideology or institution itself, one unaware of its own edges and limits? What does it take in this environment to put the actual drive (may I say passion) of feminism \u2014the fight against discrimination based on gender\u2014into action? How can I teach and expand this struggle into its intersections with race, ability, and socioeconomic standing as a necessity? What is the role of language in this needed pedagogy? How can I support the students (independent of their gender) to be prepared for the highly gendered and segregated environ\u00ad ment of the art world if they resist acknowledging these conditions? And, on a broader level: How can one respond to the challenges of the never\u00adending sexisms without falling oneself into roles that are already written and immobile, and therefore reinscribing instead of deconstruct\u00ad ing gender hierarchies? What Privilege Isn't; or, Unlearning One's Privilege as One's Loss With these challenges from the inside and the outside, I find it helpful to look at feminist liter\u00ad ary theorist Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's notion of \"unlearning one's privilege as one's loss.\" Literary scholars Donna Landry and Gerald MacLean put Spivak's thinking this way: \"Our privileges, whatever they may be in terms of race, class, nationality, gender, and the like, may have prevented us from gaining a certain kind of Other knowledge: not simply information that we have not yet received, but the knowledge that we are not equipped to understand by reason of our social position.\"4 Spivak suggests that, in coming to see one's privi\u00ad lege, one may see how one is limited and shaped by a particular view or discourse, and also realise that other ontologies and epistemologies exist and, in fact, compete against 323one's own. The idea of \"unlearning one's privilege as one's loss\" marks a metaperspective on the hierarchies of modern society, since it may be interpreted as a question. To address gender discrimination on the basis of privilege offers an entry into the debate that bypasses morality and a simple notion of political correct\u00ad ness by classifying discrimination as a lack of knowledge, a blind spot, a lack\u2014a loss, in fact. And this opening towards knowledge releases the deadlock of prescribed bipolari\u00ad ties and offers a broader perspective on the question of how questions of gender operate within systems of power. Following Spivak's example, in a very broad sense, the task is to guide students to the limitations of their positions within the patriarchal sys\u00ad tem, and how these limitations not only apply to them but also affect others, all students (and all teachers) alike. The aim is to arrive at dis\u00ad crimination as a collective problem through a critical reflection on beliefs, prejudices, and assumptions of norms and their formation as naturalised in one's own perception. These reflections can also take into account that, within a political strug\u00ad gle, identities such as woman, trans, queen, man, queer, female, lesbian, gay, and any nuance in between do not have to be fixed and deter\u00ad mined to have credibility and agency, but rather should be considered potent, not despite, but because of, their respective fluidity. They can be understood as an agile and responsive strategy, in response to a universal condition. Thus, what gender means, how it is performed and experienced, both individually and structurally, can be acknowledged as constantly under negoti ation and therefore also not restrained. As a consequence, I suggest that the need to unify concepts of identity within traditional feminist debate should be replaced by a building of alliances along lines of equity and recognition and considerations that run across acknowledged and celebrated difference based on the multiple possibilities of inter\u00ad sectional identities. I believe that what is needed today for a produc\u00ad tive feminist struggle is not simply the collective validation of any one \"oppressed identity\" but instead a collective validation of and com\u00ad mitment to difference. We must support our students in this process of recognising each other as differ\u00ad ent, recognising each other's gender identities in dialogue with other markers such as culture and race. We should affirm each other's right to and the beauty of self\u00ad determination, and give assurance to our students that this affirmation of difference does not need to lead to individualisation, fragmentation, and maybe consequentially iso\u00ad lation\u2014but, on the contrary, that organising across lines of affinities is an incredibly powerful tool in any political struggle. 24 Andrea Geyer324 What I describe here is of course a longer process in need of repetition. The choreographer and filmmaker Yvonne Rainer said once that all we can ever be is \"recovering sexists, racists, classists, etc.\" I've always appreciated this comment, as it liberated me from the conception of an ideal reality that should be reached as an ultimate goal\u2014some\u00ad thing like an ultimate enlightened condition. It allowed me to instead see the goal in the process itself: to create an ongoing awareness of discrimination around oneself but also importantly within one's own perception. The aim is to include the modes of challenge within one's practice, not as a burden but as a fact and as a potential. I see this establishment of a space of con\u00ad tinuous negotiation being most pro\u00ad ductive in a teaching environment. To quote Spivak once more: \"An uncoercive rearrangement of desires, then; the repeated effort in the classroom.\"5 After giving the term \"woman\" some consideration, I would like to return to the institution and its structures and suggest a new set of questions: What kind of institutions do we need that do not reinscribe the hierarchical violence of patriar\u00ad chy? What structural changes need to be made within institutions to not reinscribe discrimination and sexisms? How can we foster the already existing forms of inter\u00ad sectional feminist organisation within art institutions?Liberal Feminism or Anarchist Feminism Given my little example from the celluloid world in the beginning, Sagan's M\u00e4dchen in Uniform , we know that institutions or environ\u00ad ments exclusively run by women are not necessarily feminist spaces. One could say that feminism is a structure, a process, a form of organisation that is driven by values and ideas of gender equality and also by the need for a response towards the oppression of patriarchy. Kara Stern's 2005 doctoral thesis, \"Chased by Fate? A Life History of Sheila Sadler and the Founding of the Village Community School,\"6 offers an interesting investigation into several community schools in New York City founded and led by women over the last thirty years. The study analyses the different leadership strategies and the effect they had on the community of the school and the school's graduates. Following the sociologist Kathleen Iannello's examination of feminism and organisational theory, Stern points to a differentiation among two branches of feminism, the first of which is \"liberal feminism,\" described as the equal rights work that took place during the 1970s and '80s aimed at \"reducing or eliminating patriarchy from larger governing institutions.\"7 This definition of feminism still resonates in most minds when confronted with the term today, and it often prompts resistance. The second 325branch is \"anarchist feminism,\" which as a movement focuses on organisational theory and the \"development of structures that avoid the kind of coercive power transmitted through hierarchical organization.\"8 It is this second term that I find interesting for us to investigate when thinking of possible structural changes. What Iannello is suggesting is an organisation built around empowerment r ather than power. For her, power represents domination and is typically wielded in hierarchical organisations, whereas empower\u00ad ment is a characteristic of non\u00ad hierarchical institutions and represents the ability to actually accomplish something and offers space for growing into and recog\u00ad nising one's abilities. Iannello concludes that this form of organ\u00ad isation is aimed at building institu\u00ad tions that foster a shared sense of ownership and that turn teach\u00ad ers, administrators, and students into team, members, and stake\u00ad holders, with the aim to create an environment in which the members form connections between and among one another\u2014connections that are based on mutual trust, an agreed set of rights and values, and a collective caring for the institution. It is these elements that challenge discrimination at its core, as all members are active par\u00ad ticipants within the institution and actively create and are responsible for the atmosphere within. Iannello describes these elements as the seal of a feminist approach to institutional organisation. I can see the challenges that such a radical reorganisation of institutions would ask for, but I think it is worthwhile to consider some of the suggestions and carry their values into a practice of teaching. With the classroom, we can work with forms of organisation that tend to the building of teams and members of a learning collective in which teachers are one part, aware of discriminatory microstructures and equipped to collectively tackle them one by one, if they occur. To foster these dialectical structures within the academies, and to mark their value and necessity, is to create a supportive space for collectivity that the students can carry on and use in their professional lives. And as an artist, I know how much that is needed in the field. Even though this suggestion to work collectively and through empowerment in terms of building critical forms of organi\u00ad sation seems relatively simple, trying to realise it while teaching within the highly individualised art world, which has a strong echo in art academies, is quite challenge and a real task. As bell hooks states: Feminist education\u2014the feminist classroom\u2014is and should be a place where there is a sense of struggle, where there is visible acknowledgment of the union of theory and 24 Andrea Geyer326practice, where we work together as teachers and students to overcome the estrangement and alienation that have become so much the norm in the contemporary university. Most importantly, feminist pedagogy should engage students in a learning process that makes the world \"more rather than less real.\" In my classrooms, we work to dispel the notion that our experience is not a \"real world\" experience. This is especially easy since gender is such a pressing issue in contemporary life. Every aspect of popular culture alerts us to the reality that folks are thinking about gender in both reactionary and progressive ways. What is important is that they are thinking critically. And it is this space that allows for the possibility of feminist intervention, whether it be in our classroom or in the life of students outside the classroom.9 To conclude, I would like to answer the call of the conference that prompted this text\u2014\"What kind of art academy would women create?\"\u2014in a direct way. I agree with Kara Stern's suggestions that the potential in a feminist institution lies not exclusively in the identities that enable it or the values that it teaches, but first of all in the mode of its organisation. And that it is through these forms of organisation that we should steer away from exclusions based on limiting notions of identity. On the contrary, ex\u00ad ceeding what we imagine when we say \"women\" or \"men,\" we should organise into structures that can sustain complex and differing identities and their continuous fluidity, and embrace that radical potential. 3271 Gregg Bordowitz, \"More or Less, \" LTTR , September 2005. 2 A phenomenon that deserves attention in itself, but unfortunately I will not be able to address it in the context of this paper.

From atop a lilac spherical stage, participants were directed through a series of confounding world- building exercises derived from the interplay of a set of twenty-seven \"gnoses\": nose-like sculptural forms, each repre- senting a different concept. Students performed various roles within the production, which ran throughout the summer, helping to induce onlookers into what, from the outside, must have resembled a strange cult. We were suited in black clothing with expertly tailored gashes cut in the back and legs, and we all reeked of the same perfume, designed specifically for the occasion to loosen people's tongues (although the German production crew told us it was giving them headaches!). Kira and I spent many days with the students in what amounted to a crash course in language, logic manipulation, and behavioural dance, all inextricably bound, as it often is in theatre, with play and laughter. There was a lovely sensation of leaving the mud mound and feeling you'd had a riotous time with your most imagi- native friends, and I think this was in large part Michael Portnoy330due to the camaraderie that developed with the Malm\u00f6 team. Wanting to extend our microcosm after documenta, we invited the students to come join us in Vilnius to help realise some projects for the Baltic Triennial, which Kira and I were curating. We thought it would be a real long shot for Gertrud Sandqvist, as the Academy's Rector, to sign off on the idea, but she happily agreed. I've kept in touch with many of those students since. This permissiveness and trust in artists' knowledge and experimentation is what distin- guishes Malm\u00f6 Art Academy from so many other pedagogical institutions I've been involved with. Looking at the course offerings each year, I'm continually impressed by the ever changing combination of rigorous academic and theoretical foundations with forays into unexpected, esoteric fields and artist-led projects. This is not only a testament to Gertrud Sandqvist's inexhaustible intellect and wide-ranging curiosity but also to the incorporation of the evolving interests of the teachers and students in the school's curriculum. Over the years, the Art Academy has allowed me great latitude to explore artistic research with the students on everything from performance methodologies and choreography to experimental comedy, folk taxonomies, and the design of participatory environments. My particular ap- proach is to further learning through embodied experience in a process of mutual invention, risk, and generative confusion, of which joy is an essential ingredient. The last course I taught, \"An Undeniable Hit\" in February 2020, was one of my favourites. The idea was to arrange a first-time collaboration between students from Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and Malm\u00f6 Theatre Academy on the ridiculous quest to create together, in only three weeks, an \"undeniable hit performance,\" which was to 331be presented within the black box theatre in the Mazetti building. The following questions were the starting point for our explorations: What makes a \"hit\" in the rarefied worlds we operate in? What is it like to focus on relatability, universality, joy, urgency, affect, generosity, hope, catchiness, electricity, caring for the audience? Does a hit need to be only a 5 percent deviation from existing art \u2014 that is, can the public only take so much originality? Do we need to lobo- tomise ourselves to create a hit? Must we sell our souls? After brainstorming about the tropes and features of contemporary performance in the realm of both theatre and the visual arts, we started to generate lots of raw material \u2014 songs, texts, and movement fragments \u2014 through various improvisatory methods. We tried to honour the truth of these unfiltered impulses that sprout from the body, lungs, and mouth without undue interference from the intellect. We then shaped these bits, permuting and developing them, and enhancing peculiarities that stimulated us. The next step was to assemble the refined bits into sequences, and only then to start making sense of the themes and concepts that were emerging so that they could inform the evolution of the piece as a whole. It was interesting to see how the different cultures and working methods of the Theatre and Art Academies interacted. The students from the theatre school were used to spending most of their days together in rehearsal rooms and were envious of the solitude the arts students had in their studios. Conversely, the arts students appreciated the collaborative spirit in the theatre school and the access to large spaces with techni- cal infrastructure to develop performances. In the visual arts, we are used to putting a premium on concept and criticality and often spend little 25 Michael Portnoy332time considering the experience of the audience \u2014 underpinned by the misconception that entertainment can't also be critical. Whereas in the theatre, one always must have the audience in mind, experience is the name of the game, and \"entertainment\" is not a dirty word. I saw my role in this production as overseer, rather than as director. It was important to involve the students in every step of the development of the piece \u2014 choreography, text, dramaturgy, costumes, lighting, music \u2014 working in the fashion of devised theatre companies, although at a hyper-accelerated pace. We often used laughter as a litmus test of whether our embodied abstractions were working, whether the elements were churning and colliding like radioactive isotopes. What we ended up with was a dance theatre show that started as a dark, ominous medieval epic about the subjugation of the peasantry, then mutated into a competition between some very fashionable purple frogs, next swerving into a wistful sleepover, a boy band concert, group techno-aerobics, a lament about the loss of identity, a strangely moving and unironic dance in the dark with faces lit by mobile phones, and finished up with a rousing singalong finale about self-actualisation. I'm not sure if it was an \"undeniable hit,\" but after only three weeks of work we definitely had a compelling show on our hands that juggled many contemporary forms and ideas and seemed to activate the audience in all the right ways. This kind of hybrid production, driven by collective joy among the troupe, can only arise within an institution that nurtures experi- mentation, elasticity, and cross-fertilisation.333Images pp. 334 - 335: For the first time ever, a joint course, \" An Undeniable Hit / En oslagbar f\u00f6rest\u00e4llning, \" was held for students at both Malm\u00f6 Art Academy and Malm\u00f6 Theatre Academy.

Geyer is an artist based in New York whose work ranges across multiple mediums, incorporating text, photography, painting, sculpture, video, and per - formance. It explores the complex politics of time and memory, with a particular focus on those who identify or at some point were identified as woman. In her work, she finds ways to re- materialise the entanglement of presence and absence created by ideologically driven omissions in archives and histories through a process of performatively unsensing time. From her early investigations into urban environments, cultural landscapes, and notions of citizenship and nation- hood in the US as well as her native Germany to more recent research into women's contributions to modernism, Geyer's work continuously seeks to create spaces that offer reorienta- tion(s) of the past towards the urgency of a present moment. Geyer's work has been exhibited widely at institutions including the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Museum of Modern Art, Whitney Museum of American Art, Artists Space, and White Columns, all in New York; Contemporary Art Museum Houston; A Space Gallery, Toronto; KINDL \u2014 Centre for Contemporary Art, Berlin; Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; Irish Museum of Modern Art, Dublin; REDCAT and LACE, Los Angeles; Tate Modern Paulo Biennial; and documenta 12, Kassel, Germany.

Portnoy is a New York- based artist. Coming from a background in dance and stand-up comedy, his perfor - mance-based work employs a variety of mediums, from participatory installations to sculpture, painting, writing, theatre, video, and curation. Portnoy is largely concerned with manipulating language and behaviour as a tool for world-bending \u2014 either in his \"Relational Stalinist\" game structures, in which confusion, complication, and ambiguity are used to stretch participants' speech and movement, or in his quest to \"improve\" existing breeds of art through re- engineering. Portnoy has presented internationally in museums, art galleries, theatres, and music halls, including recently at Steirischer Herbst, Graz, 2018 and 2019; Museum Amsterdam, 2013; KW Institute for Contem- porary Art, Berlin, Baltic 2010.

In 2014, she obtained a Doctorate in Fine Arts from the Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki, and between 2010 and 2015, Rantanen was Professor at the same academy. She has been an active participant in the cultural debate throughout her career as an artist. In her writings, she interprets art historical subjects as seen through the eyes of a contemporary artist, plus the relationship between visual art and other arts. Rantanen's published essays are on topics ranging from the films of Pedro Almod\u00f3var, to the avant-garde art of Natalja Gontarova, to the literature of Leo Tolstoy.

Sandqvist works in a wide variety of mediums. In recent years, he has been investigating the shift from industrialism to post- industrialism that is taking place in the Global North, with a particular interest in the change and displacement of labour due to outsourcing and autom- atisation, and how this has changed the cultural idea of work. Focusing on the traces and indexes of production, Sandqvist backtracks images and objects, examining the confusion where images and objects seem to have erased their own footprints. He is also exploring the structure of the digital image and its inherent complex relation between realism and abstraction. Marie Thams Marie Thams (DK) was Editor of the Malm\u00f6 Art Academy Yearbook from 2013 to 2019 and was Guest Teacher at Malm\u00f6 Art Academy in 2015. Thams is a visual artist based in Copenhagen.

Her work reacts to current cultural and political structures and values, resulting in critical and sensuously enclosing works. Voice plays a key role in Thams's practice, which she works with in installation, audio works, performance, and publication. Recent solo exhibitions include URBANEK, London; Milestone Institute, include ARKEN Museum for Modern Art, Ish\u00f8j, Denmark; Heartland Festival, Egeskov Art, Copenhagen; and Screen Festival, Barcelona.

If anything, this type of environment is in danger in our contemporary societies, at least for us as educators. We must be able to trust our artist-students. We must be able to trust our artist-teachers. We must dare to allow individual curricula to have long periods when seemingly nothing is happening. We must learn how to listen to the breath of creativity. We must facilitate this by allowing small unities, where people know each other and trust each other. We must dare to describe rather than prescribe. We must learn to recognise the signs that tell us when to act and when to wait. We must be able to consider an art academy as an organism rather than a structure. \u2014 Gertrud Sandqvist Julie Ault a Core Condition: Malm\u00f6 Art Academy 25 Years marks the twenty\u00adfifth anniversary of Malm\u00f6 Art Academy "}
