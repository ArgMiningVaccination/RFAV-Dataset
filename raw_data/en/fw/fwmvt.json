Our Values Integrity Commitment Passion Seamlessness Speed212,787 Customer Base - Grown 35x in 5 years 94 Branches 2,283 Employees ICRA A1+/AAA CARE AAA Credit Ratings 9 ABOUT ABFLCEO'S MESSAGE Retaining our growth momentumEven though the impact of the pandemic varied across countries and regions, it distressed all - from large conglomerates to small businesses - leading to a 3.3% contraction in the global economy. Back home, we were already facing some headwinds when the pandemic struck, sending the economy into a downward spiral and a reported contraction of 7.3%. The government policy of 'lives over livelihoods' sent 1.3 Billion people into strict confinement of their homes following the imposition of the national lockdown in March 2020. The Indian economy registered the worst ever quarterly contraction of 22.4% in the first quarter of FY 2020-21. The gradual removal of the restrictions did help the economy to rev up, with people gradually adapting to the 'new normal'. A slew of measures announced by the Government of India and stimulus packages also aided in cushioning the impact of the pandemic to a certain extent. Like most businesses across the globe, we, at ABFL, were also adversely impacted by the pandemic. Responding to the pandemic, the ABFL way We prioritised our employees' health over everything else, and were among the first in the industry to transition our employees across branches to the work- from-home model even before the national lockdown had been announced. We activated our Business Continuity Plan that brought together multiple verticals for a seamless transition to digital, which became the need of the hour. With the dedication of our teams and our collective efforts, we were able to ensure uninterrupted customer service. We were also the first in the industry to reopen and welcome our customers back to our branches. We adapted quickly and embraced the new operating model that prioritised the health and well-being of our employees, while continuing to support and cater to the needs of our customers. Dear Stakeholders, I hope you and your family are safe and in good health during these difficult times. People around the world have faced unprecedent challenges during the year, with the pandemic impacting lives and livelihoods of millions. The turn of the decade will forever be marked in history for the resilience and solidarity shown by mankind while facing an invisible adversary. Our Business Continuity Plan brought together multiple verticals for a seamless transition to digital, which was becoming the need of the hour. 11 OUR PROGRESSOUR PROGRESSCEO'S MESSAGE with the multiple re-pricing and margin improvement measures that we undertook. This was further backed by well-considered product mix changes with a focus on retail expansion strategy in order to increase proportion of higher margin segments in the portfolio. Maintaining liquidity in uncertain times We have one of the lowest interest rates in the market on the back of our vigorous and effective treasury management strategy. We continue to focus on the diversification of our borrowing products, which helps optimise the pricing and reducing the overall cost of borrowing. Our Cost of Borrowing (COB) and Cost of Fund (COF) were reduced by 64 bps and 77 bps to 7.58% and 6.35%, respectively, during the year. We also raised long term funds through multiple sources, amounting to 8,276 Crore, thus taking our outstanding debt to 41,215 Crore. As a testament to our dynamic liquidity management, we received international recognition and won the AAA Asset Award under the category 'Best Trade Finance Solution' for our unique structured borrowings of 500 Crore, backed by our ECLGS portfolio with Deutsche Bank. Maintaining credit quality In these volatile times, we were able to maintain as well as improve the credit quality of our assets, in some segments. This was achieved with our strong underwriting capabilities, enhancement of our collection infrastructure, and focused Stage 3 resolutions. We strategically reduced exposures in the corporate and Loan against Shares (LAS) segments, and continued to increase our focus on the high margin retail and SME segments. During the year, we resolved stressed assets worth 725 Crore, amounting to ~50% of our GS3 book of the previous financial year. At the same time, we further increased our GS3 provision coverage by ~12% to 45.2% by the end of the year and created a floating COVID-19 provision of 129 Crore. ~77% of our total loan portfolio is secured and an additional 3.4% of the portfolio is guaranteed under the CGTSME guarantee scheme (SIDBI). We held security value of 79,697 Crore against loan book of 48,689 Crore, and security value of 1,194 Crore against Net Stage 3 assets of 716 Crore thereby closing the year with a net security cover of 1.7x. Supportive central bank measures1 Multiple regulatory and fiscal measures undertaken by the government and the RBI helped keep the economy afloat and maintain sufficient liquidity in the market. Pre-emptive monetary easing announced by the RBI through three measures, LTROs, CRR cut of 100 bps, and an increase in marginal standing facility (MSF) to 3% of the Statutory Liquidity Ratio (SLR) - secured enough liquidity in the market. Regulatory measures undertaken to promote credit flows to the retail and MSMEs sector, which was later extended to loans from NBFCs, was a huge plus. Exemption of CRR maintenance for all additional retail loans and extension of priority sector classification for bank loans to NBFCs till the end of the fiscal year were also favourable measures for the banking and financial services sector. We extended the benefit of the relief measures to our eligible customers, in line with the guidance of the government and the RBI. This included Guaranteed Emergency Credit Line (GECL) under the Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) of the National Credit Guarantee Trustee Company Ltd., extension of Date of Commencement of Commercial Operations (DCCO), and restructuring options under the guidelines of the RBI. 1 IMF and Atmanirbhar Bharat presentations Strong performance despite the headwinds In spite of several challenges faced during the year, we were resolute in our efforts. Supported by our robust fundamentals, we were able to close the year on a strong footing. While our operations were severely impacted during the initial months of operations, we closed the year with a 3% growth in our loan book, which stood at 48,689 Crore at the end of FY 2020-21 against 47,057 Crore at end of FY 2019-20. Our Net Interest Income reduced by 60 bps to 2,512 Crore as against 2,528 Crore in the previous year. We did see some adverse impact on our revenue and PAT, which declined to 5,528 Crore and 769 Crore respectively, as against 6,089 Crore and 805 Crore the previous year. Despite the multiple restrictions during the pandemic, we were able to add 26 branches, taking the total count of branches to 94 by the end of the year. We maintained our record of consistent margin growth by optimising our borrowing costs, along 12 Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |Digital intervention We are leveraging our robust digital capability to stay ahead of the curve, while enhancing customer experience, driving digital reach and strengthening our operations. We have created an agile platform for a completely digital onboarding process and state- of-the-art LOS and LMS systems for ease of loan origination and management. Further, to enhance customer engagement, we have built multiple platforms for digital customer self-service. We used digital interventions for improving our collections as well. Going forward The second wave of the pandemic has posed a temporary challenge to economic revival, but we remain buoyed by the resilience and green shoots of recovery seen post the first wave. We believe that the government's mega push through huge capital outlays will bring about favourable trends in private investments too. With the long-term macro- factors remaining intact, the growing tempo of the vaccination drive, favourable policy and increasing adaptability of the public and business to operate amid the altered conditions, we feel that the situation will stabilise and businesses will return back to normalcy. We expect the revival and further growth to be the strongest in the retail and SME segment, outperforming overall credit growth, and we plan to increase our stronghold in these segments going forward. We remain buoyed by India's strong growth and will be expanding our footprint in the underserved semi- urban areas while leveraging our digital platforms to provide a secure, superior, and seamless experience to our customers. We will also be leveraging our existing alliances and expanding our partnerships by anchoring on the group ecosystem to augment growth especially for retail acquisition. We will continue to invest in technology and analytical tools, which will play an integral part in expanding our digital footprint and increasing upsell and cross-sell to our existing customer base. The trust and confidence of our customers have remained our strongest anchor, encouraging us to consistently improve our products and service propositions. We remain persistent in our resolve to being a future-ready organisation, consistently evolving our capabilities and capacity to ensure superior value creation for our stakeholders. Along with other members of the Board, I would like to take this opportunity to thank our customers, suppliers, partners and governments for their continued support. We would also like to take this moment to express our gratitude to each member of our team whose commitment and determination have helped us navigate these uncertain times.

The early template to deal with the pandemic was the model of strict lockdowns and social distancing, which resulted in sharp collapse in growth, equity and commodity markets. Consequently, bond yields fell sharply in both EMs and DMs and growth estimates were cut to the lowest levels since the Great Depression. Policy makers in both advanced and emerging economies responded with aggressive monetary-fiscal stimulus packages. Total global pandemic-related fiscal actions as estimated by IMF stands at an astoundingly high level of $16 trillion: $10 trillion consists of additional spending and foregone revenue and $6 trillion consists of government loans, guarantees and capital injections. This was complemented by aggressive and synchronous policy actions by Central Banks, which took global interest rates to the lowest levels on record and ensured that despite the high fiscal push, borrowing costs remained low. The combination of aggressive policy actions, evolution of medical response to deal with the pandemic and release of pent up demand resulted in rebound of the global economy. Across the world, sharp downgrades have been followed by healthy upgrades in growth estimates . Bond yields have also rebounded in response to improved economic outlook and higher inflation expectation. With progress in vaccinations across the world and significant part of stimulus still persisting, the outlook for the global economy in 2021 is better with IMF forecasting strong growth, aided by a favourable base. OVERVIEW OF INDIAN ECONOMY In India as well we had a similar story, with the economy and markets being guided by the evolution of the pandemic and Government's response to the same. Early in the pandemic, India's response was of a strict nationwide lockdown beginning mid-March 2020. The consequent demand collapse & supply side disruption led to highest ever Y-o-Y decline of 24.4%1 in Q1FY 2020-21 GDP, with industrial sector Gross value added (GVA) contracting by 35.9%, services by 21.4% and Agriculture GVA growing at 3.3%. GDP Growth rebounded sharply, more than expected earlier, in the following three quarters of the year as lockdown restrictions were gradually eased and strong pent-up demand was unleashed, with Q2 and Q3 growth at -7.3% and +0.4% Y-o-Y. The recovery post Q2 was on the back of revival in government expenditure & fixed investment and easing of the contraction in private consumption. Showing resilience, the agricultural GVA growth remained in positive territory at 3%+ Y-o-Y growth in all three quarters Management Discussion and Analysis while Industry sector clocked 2.7% Y-o-Y growth in Q3 after declining 35.9% Y-o-Y in Q1. Within Industry, the manufacturing sector emerged from 35.9% Y-o-Y decline in Q1 to positive 1.5% growth in Q3. Following industry, the services sector also picked up with Q3 Y-o-Y decline of 1.0% as compared to 21.4% decline in Q1. Equity markets reflected the sharp deterioration, then improvement in growth prospects of the economy as also the pattern in global equity markets. Interest rates and bond yields remained low for most of FY 2020-21 before rising post the Union Budget. The collapse in import demand and fall in international oil prices resulted in current account turning to surplus in the fiscal, largely due to strong surplus in H1. After sharp capital outflows in Q1, foreign capital flows also returned strongly in the rest of the year, led by healthy FDI flows. FDI inflows after recording 88% Y-o-Y decline in Y-o-Y followed by 45% Y-o-Y increase in Q3. Current account surplus and good capital inflows resulted in good surplus in BoP account and strong build-up of forex reserves, which grew to $579 billion as on 26th March 2021 with Y-o-Y growth of 21.8% and helped in reducing INR volatility through the pandemic. The fears of a prolonged economic recession were addressed by the concerted monetary and fiscal steps taken by RBI & Government. POLICY MEASURES To avert any shortage of liquidity in the hands of corporates and households, RBI rolled out an easy monetary policy. In March 2020, the repo rate was slashed by 75 bps to 4.4% and later to 4.0% by May 20. To incentivise banks to lend, the reverse repo rate which sets the floor of the liquidity adjustment facility (LAF) corridor, was reduced by 90 basis points from 4.9% to 4.0% in March 2020 and to 3.35% in May 2020. The borrowers impacted by disruption in their cash flows were given relief when RBI allowed lenders to grant moratoriums on loan repayments initially for 3 months, further extended till 31st August 2020. Asset classification freeze for standard accounts was also implemented. To reduce the financial stress on borrowers due to the COVID-19 pandemic, lending institutions were allowed to restructure borrowers' accounts which were standard as on 1st March 2020 either through rescheduling of repayments, granting of moratorium or conversion of interest into credit facility. The existing scheme of restructuring for MSMEs was also extended till March 2021 under which existing standard loans as on 1st March 2020 could be restructured without a downgrade in the asset classification. In September 2020, guidelines on sector specific key financial ratios were also laid out for resolution of stressed industrial sectors 1 Real GDP at 2011-12 price; Source MOSPI35STATUTORY REPORTS To avoid freezing of debt markets and to lower the liquidity premium on debt securities, RBI announced Targeted Long term repo operations (TLTROs). In TLTRO 1.0, liquidity injected was to the tune of 1 Lakh Crore, in which banks could access funds from RBI for 3 years at rates linked to repo rates. The Banks were required to invest 50% in primary market debt issuances and the remaining in the secondary market. In TLTRO 2.0, under which 50,000 Crore of liquidity was infused, special dispensation was made for NBFCs. 50% of the funds were to be deployed by banks to buy securities issued by NBFCs/ MFIs Increased the limit under the marginal standing facility (MSF) from 2% to 3% Reduced the cash reserve ratio (CRR) of all banks by 100 basis points to 3.0% till March 2021 50,000 Crore Special Liquidity Facility for Mutual Funds to ease liquidity pressures on MF Refinance facilities of 30,000 Crore to NABARD for refinancing regional rural banks (RRBs), cooperative banks and MFIs; 15,000 Crore to SIDBI for on-lending/refinancing; and 15,000 Crore to NHB for supporting Housing Finance Companies (HFCs) were sanctioned Increase in Loan to Value (LTV) ratio for gold loans: LTV for loans against pledge of gold for non-agricultural purposes enhanced from 75 per cent to 90 per cent The Government of India, on its part, also worked out a support package To aid Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) sector, Emergency Credit Line Guarantee Scheme (ECLGS) was announced under which incremental credit amounting 20% of outstanding credit as on 29th February 2020 was covered with 100% Government guarantee with no collateral and no guarantee fee. 20,000 Crore as subordinated debt for functioning MSMEs which are NPA or stressed. Government to provide support of 4,000 Crore to CGTMSE who in turn will provide partial Credit Guarantee support to Banks & NBFC on loans given to MSMEs 50,000 Crore equity infusion in MSME through fund of funds 45,000 Crore partial credit guarantee scheme for NBFCs with first 20% loss to be borne by Government on AA and below rated NBFCs papers Special liquidity facility under which Government provided 100% guarantee on investment grade debt securities of NBFC /MFI 90,000 Crore liquidity injection for power distribution companiesIn the latter half of the fiscal, the focus of the policy efforts shifted from mitigating stress to supporting the recovery and supporting growth. Budget announced plan to form an Asset reconstruction company to take over NPAs from Banks. Recapitalisation of PSBs was also announced. A thrust was given to infrastructure creation with higher budgetary support towards capital asset creation Extension of ECLGS scheme to 30th June 2021 or till guarantees for an amount of 3 Lakh Crore are issued. Scope was extended to 26 stressed sectors as per K V Kamath Committee and subsequently Healthcare, Hospitality, Travel & Tourism and Leisure & Sporting sectors were also covered Scheduled Commercial Banks allowed to deduct the amount equivalent to credit disbursed to 'New MSME borrowers' from their Net Demand and Time Liabilities (NDTL) for calculation of the Cash Reserve Ratio (CRR) Inclusion of state government securities in October 2020 in RBI 's Asset Purchase Programme Restoration of CRR: Banks to maintain the CRR at 3.5% from the fortnight beginning 27th March 2021 and 4.0 per cent of NDTL effective from fortnight beginning 22nd May 2021 Continuing its support to the micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) sector, the Reserve Bank further extended the existing restructuring framework for MSMEs up to 30th September 2021 Banks permitted to hold under Held to Maturity (HTM) category, SLR securities acquired on or after 1st September 2020 up to an overall limit of 22 per cent of NDTL, up to 31st March 2021. The dispensation was extended up to 31st March 2022. INDUSTRY STRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENTS Over the years, the differentiated offering of the NBFC segment coupled with last mile connectivity has helped NBFCs to emerge as a key player in Indian financing sector. The NBFCs' non-food credit to GDP ratio has risen to 11.6% in 20202 from 8.8% in 2014 & has grown at a faster pace than the credit growth for Banks during the period. On the liability side, NBFCs have become more and more interconnected with the financial system. During FY 2020-21, NBFCs faced asset growth challenges due to the headwinds in the form of asset quality concern and the general slowdown in the economy. However as the unlocking of the economy began, retail credit inquiry volumes showed an uptick3. MSME credit demand also rebounded on account of ECLGS and government stimulus. The collection efficiency reported by NBFCs exhibited a recovery in the second half of the fiscal year supported by rebound in economic activities and ease in lockdown. 2 Source: RBI's Dec 2020 Publication on NBFI | The GDP is on current market price basis 3 Transunion CIBIL Dec 20 Industry Insight report36 Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |With the onset of pandemic, there were fears of a widespread liquidity crisis. While NBFCs gave reprieve to their borrowers by granting moratorium, NBFCs themselves were ineligible to get moratorium on their borrowings from banks. However, the fears were unfounded as the ample liquidity infused by RBI ensured that even the AA & below rated NBFCs could borrow funds. Driven by fall in corporate bond yield as well as risk spread, historic low borrowing rates and heightened activity in equity market, NBFCs could raise debt & equity funds that strengthened their capital base and lowered cost of borrowing. In addition to NBFCs /MFI focussed LTRO, other policy measures taken to shore up investors' confidence in NBFC sector were 30,000 Crore special liquidity scheme to invest in investment grade debt papers of NBFCs /HFC/MFIs fully guaranteed by Government For AA and lower rated NBFC / MFIs 20% credit guarantee to cover primary market issuance of such entities In February 2021, the RBI allowed lending by banks to NBFCs under the TLTRO on-tap scheme for incremental lending to specified stressed sectors In respect of loans to commercial real estate projects delayed for reasons beyond the control of promoters, date for commencement for commercial operations (DCCO) was allowed to be extended by an additional one year, over and above the one-year extension permitted in the normal course, without treating the same as restructuring Eligibility criteria for declaration of dividend by NBFCs (non-deposit accepting & systemically important / deposit accepting) were -CRAR of at least 15% for last 3 years. - The net NPA ratio should be less than 6% in each of the last three years Co-Lending by Banks and NBFCs to Priority Sector - Review of the Co-Origination Model: The scheme was recast as a \"Co-Lending Model\" (CLM).

In construction finance, ABFL deals with top category developers having a significant track record. In line with our stated strategy of portfolio rebalancing, the average ticket size of construction finance is at 8 Crore (outstanding).Management Discussion and Analysis41STATUTORY REPORTS The size of the portfolio for this segment was 21,344 Crore at the beginning of FY 2020-21. With a conscious strategic reduction of 1,804 Crore of assets, it closed the year at 19,690 Crore, thereby registering 8% degrowth in FY 2020-21. The book is down by 5,000 Crore since its peak in FY 2018-19. The average ticket size of the loans was strategically lowered to 53 Crore/customer from 59 Crore in FY 2019-20.

This is in line with the Company's objective to diversify and increase granularity of its loan book.

Aditya Birla Wealth - HNI + CTS High Net-wo rth Individual Business Wealth Management segment (WMS) caters to the requirements of High Net worth and Ultra High net Worth individuals and aims to provide customised investment options to meet their goals. Corporate and Treasury Services The Corporate and Treasury Services (CTS) caters to the requirements of SMEs, Mid and Large Corporates and aims to provide customised Investment solutions to meet their investment requirements. This business works to develop and execute investment solutions for the diverse corporate client base through our research and advisory services.2. Aditya Birla Wealth - Retail Business Partner Group The Business Partner Group (BPG) caters to the IFA's and Channel Partners who work with retail clients across the country, especially in Tier II and III locations. They acquire and service these clients across multiple products especially Mutual Funds for a revenue share with us. Business partners work to boost sales, decrease time to market and provide access to markets, with relatively low fixed costs. Online Business The existing portfolio of Aditya Birla MyUniverse has now got fully integrated with the Wealth Management business and is now categorised as Online business (ONL). The clients in this segment are the self-directed individuals who are comfortable with the use of technology for their financial needs - across Investment (Mutual Funds, direct equity via referral to Aditya Birla Money, Digital Gold, Fixed Deposits, etc.) & Financing (Personal Loans, Home Loans, Business Loans, etc.) product choices. There are significant potential synergies for these tech offerings with the existing channels of Wealth Management especially the Business Partner Group, which caters to retail customers across the country. The tech platform makes the acquisition, fulfilment, engagement & cross sell to the retail clients easier and more seamless, more financially viable and very scalable; and is in line with our intent to provide unbiased offerings for clients across financial service products. The AuA under Wealth Management has grown at a rate of 13% from 13,719 Crore as on 31st March 2020 to 15,543 Crore as on 31st March 2021. This is in line with the rise in equity markets in the same period. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ABFL has consistently increased margins year-on-year. The year 2020-21 witnessed a growth in the Net Interest Margin (including fee income) expanding by 23 bps to 5.34%, through repricing and margin improvement measures driven by product mix changes throughout the year. This reflects the increased proportion of higher margin segments in the portfolio and optimised borrowing costs. During the year under review, revenues of the Company reduced by 9% to 5,528 Crore, driven by reduction in average loan book. ABFL's PBT declined marginally by 2% to 1,031 Crore from 1,053 Crore. PBT was negatively impacted by lower revenues and higher opex due to the retail expansion but was helped by lower borrowing costs. On account of higher tax outgo, Net profit after tax fell by 4% from 805 Crore to 769 Crore. Networth of ABFL as on 31st 2020-21 Aditya Birla Interest /Avg.

Despite a fall in GS3 assets, the Company increased its GS3 provision coverage to 45.2% from 33.3% in FY 2019-20. The Company has also maintained a total floating provision of 129 Crore. The Stage 3 credit loss differs between secured and unsecured loans as 'loss given default' (as a proportion of total exposure) in the case of unsecured loans is generally higher than that experienced in secured loans. The largely secured book provided an additional safety layer in such uncertain times, despite an increase in the Expected Credit Loss (ECL) provisions. Approximately 77% of ABFL's portfolio is secured as of March 2021, with a net security cover >1.7x. An additional 3% of the portfolio is guaranteed under the CGTMSE (SIDBI) scheme.

COST OF BORROWING (AVG.) The Company has strong funding access with adequate liquidity surplus and amongst lowest cost of borrowing in the industry, demonstrated over the last 2 years of economic cycles. During the year, the Cost of Borrowing (COB) of the Company fell by 64 bps on Y-o-Y basis whil e it declined by 93 bps Q-o-Q. The Cost of Fund (COF) which is defined as total interest costs divided by average loan assets, has reduced by 77 bps on Y-o-Y basis. 8.227.58 COB COF FY20 FY217.136.36(%) COB The weighted average cost - WAY FORWARD AND OUTLOOK ON DOMESTIC GROWTH The beginning of FY 2021-22 saw an outbreak of the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, appearin g to be much more severe than the first wave. However, in place of a national lockdown as in the first wave, localised containment measures and social distancing steps are being taken by State Governments this time around. The uncertainty about COVID-19's spread remains the biggest known unknown. Thus the forecasts of Output growth, financial market conditions and the credit environment remain contingent on severity of COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination speed and policy response.Nonetheless, the IMF in its April 2021 edition of world economic outlook has projected India to be fastest growing major economy in FY 2021-22 & FY 2022-23 with real GDP growth rates of 12.5% & 6.9% respectively on the base of 8.0% decline in FY 2020-21. RBI too has projected India 's GDP baseline growth rate at 10.5% in FY 2021-22 and 6.8% in FY 2022-234. We expect a much lower impact in industry this time given that most of the manufacturing has been untouched by mobility restrictions, unlike in 2020 when the lockdown had a serious impact on industrial growth. However lower demand, generally weak sentiments, and logistical hiccups May have some negative impact on industrial growth. We expect agriculture will remain strong and services growth should rebound once mobility increases. On the positive side, global growth is likely to be the strongest in 50 years which is positive for industrial exports. NBFC OUTLOOK Loan demand is expected to grow once the recovery gains strength. Once the uncertainty reduces, investments are expected to gain traction. Government's increased capital outlay plan laid out in Budget as well as continued momentum in capex can be expected to be followed by private investments too. On Retail/SME side, certain structural drivers remain in place viz. Formalisation of economy, under-penetration of household debt, Technological innovations that are facilitating ease of credit access, digital medium to on-board customers, latent housing demand and product innovation, etc. FY 2021-22 can be expected to witness Retail / SME growth outperforming overall credit growth. INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND THEIR ADEQUACY The Company has adequate internal controls, systems and procedures across all lines of business and support functions, commensurate with the complexity and nature of its business operations. The controls ensure that all assets are safeguarded and protected against loss from unauthorised use or disposition, and that the transactions are authorised, recorded and reported correctly. The Company's management functions undergo an independent internal audit basis the scope and calendar approved by the Audit Committee of the Board. The Company's controls over its business operations are managed effectively by instituting well-defined policies and procedures and adequate supervision and reviews to ensure that the internal control systems are adequate to protect the Company against any loss or misuse of the Company's assets.

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS Management Discussion and Analysis Report for the Financial Year under review, prepared as per requirements of RBI's Non-Banking Financial Company - Systemically Important Non-Deposit taking Company and Deposit taking Company (Reserve Bank) Directions, 2016, is presented as a separate section, which forms part of this Annual Report. REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Company is committed to maintaining the highest standards of Corporate Governance and adhering to the Corporate Governance requirements set out by the RBI and Securities and Exchange Board of India. Corporate Governance principles form an integral part of the core values of the Company. Report on Corporate Governance forming part of Board's Report for the year under review is presented separately as Annexure III . RISK MANAGEMENT Risk Management is at the core of our business and ensuring we have the right risk-return trade-off in keeping with our risk appetite is the essence of our risk management. The Company has a robust Risk Management framework which proactively addresses risks while looking to optimise the returns that go with that risk. The objectives and scope of the Risk Management broadly include: risk identification; risk assessment; risk Response & Risk Management strategy; and and risk monitoring, communication and reporting with the objective to contain the negative impact of unmitigated risks on profitability and capital. The Company is exposed to various risks that are inherent to lending business. FY 2020-21 due to the pandemic and consequent lockdowns caused disruption and challenges. The Company showed good resilience due to the strong Business Continuity Plan and Pandemic Plans. Over the years, the Company have built a strong Risk Management Framework supported by well-established policies and procedures and a talented pool of Risk Professionals. The Company was able to face the unprecedented challenges during the last year and emerge stronger during these turbulent times due to some of these policies and framework. The organisational structure to address the risk consists of \"Three lines of defense\": First: Line Management (Functional Heads) to ensure that accountability and ownership is as close as possible to the activity that creates the risks; Second: Risk Oversight - Risk and Compliance Function, Chief Executive Officer; Third: Independent Assurance - Internal Audit, conducted by Independent Internal Auditors, whose work is reviewed by the Audit Committee. The Company faces potential risks, which can be classified as credit risk, liquidity risk, operational risk, market risk and IT risk. Creating awareness of the risks faced by the organisation is, we believe, an important way to manage risk and accordingly, the Company makes all efforts to create an environment of risk awareness at all levels. The Company has policies and procedures in place to identify, measure, assess, monitor, and manage these risks systematically across all its lines of business. The Company continually upgrades necessary security measures, including cybersecurity measures, to ensure mitigation of cyber threats and risks. Risk management in ABFL is an independent function, in the context of separation of roles of credit origination (duty cast on the business functions) and evaluation and assessment (duty cast on the credit risk function) to ensure the independence of risk measurement, monitoring and control functions. This framework also enables business units at the operating level, with the use of technology, to identify opportunities to lend which fall within the risk appetite of the Company. The various risks across the Company are monitored and reviewed through the Risk Committee of the Board (RC) - the apex body for risk management and the Executive Level Committees, which meet periodically. Some of the executive level committees are the Asset Liability Committee (managing the liquidity risk and interest rate risk), Credit Committees and Investment Committees (to approve credit proposals and Board's Report51STATUTORY REPORTS investment proposals), Product Approval Committee (to approve any new product being offering), Operational Risk Management Committee (to identify, measure and monitor operational risks in the business) and Information Technology Steering Committee (to oversee the robustness of the IT systems and policies to manage cyber threats). Credit Committees not only approve counter-party credit exposures in line with the delegation of authority assigned by the Board of Directors, but also focus on post sanction monitoring. These Committees also review the credit portfolios, non-performing loans, accounts under watch, over dues and incremental sanctions on an on-going basis. The Audit Committee of the Board provides direction to and monitors the quality of the internal audit function and controls and also monitors compliance with observation reports of RBI, other regulators and internal & statutory auditors. 1. CREDIT RISK - ABFL has put in place robust credit appraisal, assessment and approval frameworks in place for identification, measurement, monitoring and controlling risks embedded in the business of taking credit exposures. Amongst the key ingredients that are evaluated in the process are: a) Industry analysis - which includes risks in sectors which are monitored continuously, and wherever warranted the exposure to higher risk industries are reviewed immediately. Impact of events on liquidity risk management framework for NBFC, Capital market measures for loan against shares, exposure to real estate sector, to name a few, are also monitored. The exposures to these sectors are analysed and appropriate responses to the emerging situations are planned to mitigate possible risks. Exposure to all sectors are presented to RC at periodic intervals and guidance if any are incorporated while underwriting new exposures. b) Business and Management analysis - reviewing the distinctive competitive advantage of the borrower's business and the linkages (forward and backward) are analysed. The business owners' and managers' credentials are analysed and reports as required are drawn from the credit bureaus and public sources. c) Financial Analysis - The audited financial statements of the applicant borrowers and their forecasted cashflows are analysed to conform to the satisfaction of the Company regarding the availability of free cash flows to service the interest and principal repayment obligations. d) Collateral and covenants - ABFL, generally, other than for retail unsecured loans, seeks to obtain acceptable collateral. While being cognisant that business cash flows are the primary source to recover the monies lent, collateral security enables the Company to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided where the borrower is unable or unwilling to fulfil its primary obligations. Similarly, covenants are stipulated and monitored which enable the Company to amend the contractual terms if the borrower fails to adhere to the terms and conditions and covenants. ABFL uses various internal Credit Risk Assessment Models and scorecards for assessing borrowers. Models for internal credit ratings of the borrowers were developed in-house with external assistance where required. Pricing of credit is decided based on the risk embedded in the credit proposal being evaluated. The Company manages concentration risk by setting its own prudential exposure limits to groups and borrowers which is more conservative than the regulatory prescription. These limits are dynamically adjusted based on the assessment of the developments with regard to the groups / borrowers. ABFL also has an early warning monitoring mechanism to facilitate early identification of stress and mitigation thereof. The Company through its Risk Policy & Monitoring unit tracks all key components like Key financial indicators, covenants and documentation. An escalation matrix is built in to enable continuous monitoring and timely resolution. This unit works in close coordination with the business segments to periodically review the individual borrower relationships, identify early warning signals and assess the overall health of borrowers. This unit takes proactive measures to ensure that delinquencies are maintained at a minimum level. Risk Monitoring unit also tracks the entire credit portfolio across all segments, including monitoring of early warning signals, identifies portfolio trends and generates portfolio level MIS, covering various credit quality indicators. Further, it independently reviews credit policies and programs. 2. MARKET RISK - Market risk is managed through a comprehensive Board-approved Investment Policy. The Company maintains an investment book of Fixed Income Instruments, mostly Inter Corporate Deposits / Government Bonds and is managed through the investment policy which caps exposure to various securities through stringent trading risk limits/triggers and Mark to Market thresholds. Policies have been benchmarked with industry best practices and RBI regulations. 3. OPERATIONAL RISK - Operational Risk is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or external events. Key elements of ABFL's Operational Risk Management framework includes, oversight by the ORMC, timely reporting of operational loss events and near miss events, reporting and ongoing review of Systems and Controls, enhancement of risk 52 Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |awareness through Risk & Control Self-Assessment (RCSA) and Risk Awareness Trainings and monitoring of Key Risk Indicators (KRIs). ABFL has a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) in place for ensuring continuity of operations at the Branches and Offices during disruptions. The BCP has enabled us to ensure near Zero business disruption during natural disasters, which occurred during the year and during the spread of pandemic - COVID-19 in FY 2020-21 and the current second wave. During the pandemic, ABFL's readiness helped the employees to quickly adopt a work from home routine. The BCP not only enabled the Company take steps to prevent the staff from being exposed to the infection but also help its customers by providing uninterrupted service as required by them. ABFL during the Financial Year ended 31st March 2021, conducted online training to enhance the awareness of operational risk. 4. LIQUIDITY RISK - ABFL has sharpened its liquidity risk management framework. Efficient management of Assets and Liabilities (ALM) is vital for sustainable growth of business for the Company. ALCO monitors the ALM position at monthly intervals and strives to proactively review the market dynamics, capturing the signals emanating from there and assessing the regulatory requirements to ensure stake holder value creation. The ALCO also monitors the contractual repayments of liabilities and actuarial repayment of the loans and advances to arrive at the bucket level gap between inflows and outflows. The Company has been maintaining cash and cash equivalent to cover repayment of liabilities maturing in the ensuing one month of its own volition to ensure the Company has the liquidity to meet contractual obligations. ABFL also adheres fully to the regulatory prescriptions on Liquidity Risk Management for NBFC's which includes maintaining stock of High-Quality Liquid Assets (HQLA) effective December 2020. 5. Fraud Risk - Risks associated with frauds are mitigated through a Fraud Risk Management framework. Fraud Control Unit reviews matters relating to fraud risk through review of cases which are entered in the system. Various fraud control management activities like document sampling, property visit, verification of stock statement, vendor profile check, customer profile check etc. are established. 6. The Ministry of corporate affairs (MCA), Government of India had notified the Companies (Indian Accounting standards), Rules 2015 on 16th February 2015 which were made mandatory for NBFCs from 1st April 2018. As per the referred accounting standards, ABFL is obligated to provide for Expected Credit losses which is defined as: \"the difference between the contractual cash flow due to the entity and cash flow that the entity expects to receive\". This difference is discounted either at original effective interest rate or any other appropriate adjusted discounted rate. Financial assets on which ECL will apply includes - (1) debtors (2) loans given to group companies / inter corporate loans (3) any debt investments (4) loan commitments (5) financial guarantee contracts, (6) lease receivables, etc. Credit loss provisioning approach has now moved from incurred to expected loss model. An entity needs to understand the significance of credit risk and its movement since its initial recognition. The new model ensures (a) timely recognition of ECLs (b) assessment of significant increase in credit risk which will provide better disclosure (c) ascertainment of better business ratios. Briefly the ECL is described below: I. Under IND AS all the assets are to be recognised as Stage 1 on initial recognition of the asset and Probability of Default (PD) of 12 months is applied. Assets where Significant Increase in Credit Risk (SICR) has been observed since initial recognition are placed under Stage 2 and lifetime PD is applied. Effectively, this has led to be more than the standard provision of 0.40% for all standard assets of the Company, which used to be the provision requirement as per the erstwhile IGAAP. II. Exposure where dues are not paid for than 90 days from the due date, are classified as Stage 3, which corresponds to classification of such exposures as Non-Performing under IGAAP. While under IGAAP exposures classified as Non-Performing would have attracted provision of 10% of the dues when classified as sub-standard, under IND AS, such exposures are treated to be under default and attracts PD of 100%. Loss given Default is estimated basis the net present value of future cash flows arising out of business and liquidation of collateral and the balance is to be provided as ECL. BUSINESS CONTINUITY The Company has a well-documented Business Continuity Management Programme which has been designed to ensure continuity of critical processes during any disruption. The continual disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and frequent lockdowns led to a difficult situation and tested the Business Continuity Policy of the Company. Nevertheless, it continued to operate in line with the procedures outlined in its Business Continuity Plan, which was modified to take care of the evolving situation and a Pandemic Plan was developed keeping in view the interest of various stakeholders like employees, customers, partners, distributors, etc. within the overall regulatory requirements and guidelines. As a result, the Company was Board's Report53STATUTORY REPORTS able to continue to operate and serve customers while taking care of the health of their employees. To manage the impact of the pandemic on the Company, a Crisis Management Team (CMT) comprising of Leadership Team members and led by the Managing Director & Chief Executive Officer of the Company was formed. Employees' health and safety was accorded top priority. Various steps were taken well before the lockdown to reduce congestion in office, maintain social distancing and enable work from home for the employees. Critical processes were identified, reviewed for implementation in a work from home scenario and wherever required alternate controls were instituted. The work from home plan was tested well in advance and glitches ironed out. After announcement of lockdown, Work-from-Home (WFH) was fully enabled for all employees. The Company also used lessons from 'work-from-home' experiment and reimagined work in a vibrant environment. The Business Continuity Plan was also supplemented with a Business Normalisation plan. This enabled the Company to resume normal Business Operations wherever the conditions had normalised. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, the efforts will be to support an effective return to work while ensuring safety of employees and customers. The Company expects the challenging times to continue for the next few months. However, it is well prepared to ensure stabilisation and Business continuity. In view of the increased threat perception, there was a continued focus on Cyber Security and the Company has continued to invest in a strong Cyber Defence Programme.

The recent circular by the RBI on 7th January 2021 issued for Banks and on 3rd February 2021 for NBFCs and Urban Co- operative banks (UCB) highlighting the upgradation of internal audit practices to Risk Based Internal Audit (RBIA) framework is a welcome change for the NBFC industry, clearly indicating direction of the regulators emphasising the independence and authority of the internal audit function as well as the need to upgrade key methodologies in risk assessment and reporting, to continually enhance the risk and control governance environment. As the Company had already imbibed the principles of risk- based-approach in internal audit over the years, the specific new stipulations as needed to be incrementally adopted are being taken up for implementation over the timeframe given by the regulator.

Our Executive Compensation Philosophy supports the design of programs that align executive rewards - including incentive programs, retirement benefit programs, promotion and advancement opportunities - with the long-term success of our stakeholders. Our reward programs recognize and reward executives who display initiative, deliver superior individual performance, and contribute to sustainable corporate and business success. OUR BUSINESS AND ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL Our Group is a conglomerate and organized in a manner such that there is sharing of resources and infrastructure. This results in uniformity of business processes and systems thereby promoting synergies and exemplary customer experiences. I. Objectives of the Executive Remuneration Program Our executive compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and reward talented executives who will contribute to our long-term success and thereby build value for our shareholders. Our executive compensation program is intended to: 1. Provide for monetary and non-monetary remuneration elements to our executives on a holistic basis 2. Emphasize \"Pay for Performance\" by aligning incentives with business strategies to reward executives who achieve or exceed Group, business and individual goals. II. Covered Executives Our Executive Compensation Philosophy applies to those executives whose remuneration is subject to the approval of the Nomination & Remuneration Committee. The covered executives are as follows: 1. Director : Defined as per the Act 2. Key Managerial Personnel : CFO, CS, any others CEO equivalent ( ex: Deputy Managing Director) 3. Senior Management: Job Band 1 and above and all other employees as defined by the Act, Section (178). III. Business and Talent Competitors We benchmark our executive pay practices and levels against peer companies in similar industries, geographies and of similar size. In addition to this, we look at secondary reference (internal and external) benchmarks in order to ensure that pay policies and levels across the Group are generally equitable internally and support the Group's global mobility objectives for executive talent. The additional reference points may take into account the executive pay practices and pay levels in other markets and industries, recognizing the differences in levels and medium of pay. IV. Executive Pay Positioning We aim to provide competitive remuneration opportunities to our executives by positioning target total remuneration (including perks and benefits, annual incentive pay-outs, long term incentive pay-outs at target performance) and target total cash compensation (including annual incentive pay-outs) at target performance directionally between median and top quartile of the primary talent market. We recognize the size and scope of the role and the market standing, skills and experience while positioning our executives. We use secondary market data only as a reference point for determining the types and amount of remuneration while principally believing that target total remuneration packages should reflect the typical cost of comparable executive talent available in the sector. V. i. Executive Pay-mix Our executive pay-mix aims to strike the appropriate balance between key components: (i) Fixed Cash compensation (Basic Salary + Allowances) (ii) Annual Incentive Plan (iii) Long-Term Incentives (iv) Perks and Benefits. ii. Performance Goal Setting We aim to ensure that for both annual incentive plans and long term incentive plans, the target performance goals shall be achievable and realistic. Threshold performance (the point at which incentive plans are paid out at their minimum, but non-zero, level) shall reflect a base-line level of performance, reflecting an estimated 90% probability of achievement. Target performance is the expected level of performance at the beginning of the performance cycle, taking into account all known relevant facts likely to impact measured performance. Maximum performance (the point at which the maximum plan payout is made) shall be based on an exceptional level of achievement, reflecting no more than an estimated 10% probability of achievement.Annexure VII Executive Remuneration PhilosophyAnnexure85STATUTORY REPORTS VI. i. Performance Measurement Annual Incentive Plan: We tie annual incentive plan pay-outs of our executives to relevant financial and operational metrics achievement and their individual performance. We annually align the financial and operational metrics with priorities/ focus areas for the business. Long-Term Incentive: Our Long-term incentive plans incentivize stretch performance, link executive remuneration to sustained long term growth and act as an attraction and retention tool We use stock options as the primary long-term incentive vehicle for our executives as we believe that they best align executive incentives with stockholder interests. We grant restricted stock units, as a secondary long term incentive vehicle, to motivate and retain our executives. ii. Executive Benefits and Perquisites Our executives are eligible to participate in our broad-based retirement, health and welfare, and other employee benefit plans. In addition to these broad-based plans, they are eligible for other benefits plans commensurate with their roles. These benefits are designed to encourage long-term careers with the Group. They are also eligible for certain perquisites with each perquisite serving a clear business purpose or need. Other Remuneration Elements Each of our executives is subject to an employment agreement. Each such agreement generally provides for a total remuneration package for our executives. We limit other remuneration elements, for e.g. Change in Control (CIC) agreements, severance agreements, to instances of compelling business need or competitive rationale and we do not provide for any tax gross-ups for our executives. Risk and Compliance We aim to ensure that the Group's remuneration programs do not encourage excessive risk taking. We review our remuneration programs for factors such as 1. Remuneration mix overly weighted towards annual incentives 2. Uncapped pay-outs 3. Unreasonable goals or thresholds 4. Steep pay-out cliffs at certain performance levels that may encourage short-term decisions to meet pay-out thresholds Claw back Clause: In an incident of restatement of financial statements due to fraud or non-compliance with any requirement of the Companies Act 2013 and the rules made thereafter, we shall recover from our executives the remuneration received in excess of what would be payable to him / her as per restatement of financial statements the executives is obligated to pertaining to the relevant performance year. Implementation The Group and Business Centre of Expertise teams will assist the Nomination & Remuneration Committee in adopting, interpreting and implementing the Executive Remuneration Philosophy. The costs of these services will be established through \"arm's length\", market-based agreements entered into as needs arise in the normal course of business.Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |86To the Members of Aditya Birla Finance Limited REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Opinion We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Aditya Birla Finance Limited (the \"Company\"), which comprise the Balance Sheet as at 31st March 2021, and the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Cash Flows and the Statement of Changes in Equity for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the \"Act\") in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (\"Ind AS\") and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31st March 2021, and its profit, total comprehensive income, its cash flows and the changes in equity for the year ended on that date. Basis for Opinion We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) Independent Auditor's Report of the Act (\"SA\"s). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (\"ICAI\") together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI's Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements. Emphasis of Matter We draw attention to Note 51(e) to the financial statements, in which the Company describes the continuing uncertainties arising from the COVID 19 pandemic. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified in respect of this matter. Key Audit Matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report. Sr. No.Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response 1. Allowances for Expected Credit Losses: As at 31st March 2021, the carrying value of loan assets measured at amortised cost, aggregated 47,59,743.36 Lakh (net of allowance of expected credit loss 1,02,118.65 Lakh) constituting approximately 94% of the Company's total assets. Significant judgement is used in classifying these loan assets and applying appropriate measurement principles. The allowance for expected credit losses (\"ECL\") on such loan assets measured at amortised cost is a critical estimate involving greater level of management judgement. As part of our risk assessment, we determined that the allowance for ECL on loan assets has a high degree of estimation uncertainty, with a potential range of reasonable outcomes for the financial statements. The elements of estimating ECL which involved increased level of audit focus are the following: Qualitative and quantitative factors used in staging the loan assets measured at amortised cost. Basis used for estimating Probabilities of Default (\"PD\"). Basis used for estimating Loss Given Default (\"LGD\").We performed the following audit procedures: We have examined the policies approved by the Board of Directors of the Company that articulate the objectives of managing each portfolio and their business models. We have also verified the methodology adopted for computation of ECL (\"ECL Model\") that addresses policies approved by the Board of Directors, procedures and controls for assessing and measuring credit risk on all lending exposures measured at amortised cost. Additionally, we have confirmed that adjustments to the output of the ECL Model is consistent with the documented rationale and basis for such adjustments and that the amount of adjustment has been approved by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. Our audit procedures related to the allowance for ECL included the following, among others: Testing the design and effectiveness of internal controls over the following: - completeness and accuracy of the Exposure at Default (\"EAD\") and the classification thereof into stages consistent with the definitions applied in accordance with the policy approved by the Board of Directors including the appropriateness of the qualitative factors to be applied.87 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Sr. No.Key Audit Matter Auditor's Response Judgements used in projecting economic scenarios and probability weights applied to reflect future economic conditions. Adjustments to model driven ECL results to address emerging trends. (Refer Note 51 to the Financial Statements) - completeness, accuracy and appropriateness of information used in the estimation of the PD and LGD for the different stages depending on the nature of the portfolio; and - computation of the ECL including methodology used to determine macro-economic overlays and adjustments to the output of the ECL Model. Also, for a sample of ECL allowance on loan assets tested: - we tested the input data such as ratings and period of default and other related information used in estimating the PD; - we evaluated reasonableness of LGD estimates by comparing actual recoveries post the loan asset becoming credit impaired with estimates of LGD; and - we evaluated the incorporation of the applicable assumptions into the ECL Model and tested the mathematical accuracy and computation of the allowances by using the same input data used by the Company. We also evaluated the adequacy of the adjustment after stressing the inputs used in determining the output as per the ECL Model and ensured that the adjustment was in conformity with the amount approved by the Audit Committee. We also assessed the disclosures made in relation to the ECL allowance to confirm compliance with the provisions of Ind AS 107. 2. Information Technology and General Controls The Company is dependent on its Information Technology (\"IT\") systems due to the significant number of transactions that are processed daily across such multiple and discrete IT systems. Also, IT application controls are critical to ensure that changes to applications and underlying data are made in an appropriate manner and under controlled environments. Appropriate controls contribute to mitigating the risk of potential fraud or errors as a result of changes to applications and data. On account of the pervasive use of its IT systems, the testing of the general computer controls of the IT systems used in financial reporting was considered to be a Key Audit MatterWith the assistance of our IT specialists, we obtained an understanding of the Company's IT applications, databases and operating systems relevant to financial reporting and the control environment. For these elements of the IT infrastucture the areas of our focus included access security (including controls over privileged access), program change controls, database management and network operations. In particular: we tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of the Company's general IT controls over the IT systems relevant to financial reporting. This included evaluation of Company's controls over segregation of duties and access rights being provisioned / modified based on duly approved requests, access for exit cases being revoked in a timely manner and access of all users being recertified during the period of audit; We also tested key automated and manual business cycle controls and logic for the reports generated through the IT infrastructure that were relevant for financial reporting or were used in the exercise of internal financial controls over financial reporting. Our tests including testing of the compensating controls or alternate procedures to assess whether there were any unaddressed IT risks that would materiality impact the financial statements. Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Directors' report including Annexures to Director's Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditors report thereon. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of our audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |88 If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. Management's Responsibility for the Financial Statements The Company's Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance including other comprehensive income, cash flows and changes in equity of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statement that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company's financial reporting process. Auditor's Responsibility for the Audit of the Financial Statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control. Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the management. Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation. Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial statements. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit. We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements Independent Auditor's Report89 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. Other Matter The financial statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 31st March 2020 prepared in accordance with Ind AS have been audited by the predecessor auditor/other auditors. The report of these auditors on these comparative financial information expressed an un-modified opinion. Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter. Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements 1. As required by Section 143(3) of the Act, based on our audit we report that: a. We have sought and obtained all the information and explanations which to the best of our knowledge and belief were necessary for the purposes of our audit. b. In our opinion, proper books of account as required by law have been kept by the Company so far as it appears from our examination of those books. c. The Balance Sheet, the Statement of Profit and Loss including Other Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Cash Flows and Statement of Changes in Equity dealt with by this Report are in agreement with the relevant books of account. d. In our opinion, the aforesaid financial statements comply with the Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Act. e.

With respect to the adequacy of the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company and the operating effectiveness of such controls, refer to our separate Report in \"Annexure A\". Our report expresses an unmodified opinion on the adequacy and operating effectiveness of the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting. g. With respect to the other matters to be included in the Auditor's report in accordance with the requirements of section 197(16) of the Act, as amended, in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us the remuneration paid by the Company to its directors during the year is in accordance with the provisions of section 197 of the Act. h. With respect to the other matters to be included in the Auditor's Report in accordance with Rule 11 of the Companies (Audit and Auditors) Rules, 2014, as amended in our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us: i. The Company has disclosed the impact of pending litigations on its financial position in its financial statements; ii. The Company did not have any long-term contracts including derivative contracts for which there were any material foreseeable losses. iii.

As required by the Companies (Auditor's Report) Order, 2016 (\"the Order\") issued by the Central Government in terms of Section 143(11) of the Act, we give in \"Annexure B\" a statement on the matters specified in paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order. For DELOITTE HASKINS & SELLS LLP Chartered Accountants (Firm's Registration No. 117366W/W-100018) Sanjiv V. Pilgaonkar (Membership Report Limited |90(REFERRED TO IN PARAGRAPH 1(F) UNDER 'REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS' SECTION OF OUR REPORT OF EVEN DATE) Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (\"the Act\") We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Aditya Birla Finance Limited (\"the Company\") as of 31st March 2021 in conjunction with our audit of the Ind AS financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date. Management's Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls The Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective company's policies, the safeguarding of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013. Auditor's Responsibility Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting (the \"Guidance Note\") issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.Annexure \"A\" to the Independent Auditor's Report Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. We believe that the audit evidence we have is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the Company's internal financial controls system over financial reporting. Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting A company's internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal financial control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Inherent Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.91 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Opinion In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31st March 2021 based on the criteria for internal financial control over financial reporting established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the application of fair value measurements required or allowed by relevant accounting standards. Accounting policies have been consistently applied to all periods presented, unless otherwise stated. The preparation of financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosed amount of contingent liabilities. Areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the Company are discussed in Note 6 - Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions. The financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (INR) and all values are rounded to the nearest lakh, except when otherwise indicated.

Financial assets and financial liabilities are generally reported on a gross basis except when, there is an unconditional legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts without being contingent on a future event and the parties intend to settle on a net basis in the following circumstances: i. The normal course of business ii. The event of default iii. The event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company and/or its counterparties\" 4 STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE: These financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Indian Accounting Standards as per the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015 as amended and notified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 and the other relevant provisions of the Act. 5 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES: 5.1 Financial Instruments A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity instrument of another entity. (i) Classification of financial instruments The classification depends on the contractual terms of the financial assets' cash flows and the Company's business model for managing financial assets. The Company determines its business model at the level that best reflects how it manages groups of financial assets to achieve its business objective.100 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited | The Company classifies its financial assets into the following measurement categories: 1. Financial assets to be measured at amortised cost 2. Financial assets to be measured at fair value through other comprehensive income 3. Financial assets to be measured at fair value through profit or loss account \" The business model is assessed on the basis of aggregated portfolios based on observable factors. These factors include: Reports reviewed by the entity's key management personnel on the performance of the financial assets. The risks impacting the performance of the business model (and the financial assets held within that business model) and its management thereof. The compensation of the managing teams (for example, whether the compensation is based on the fair value of the assets managed or on the contractual cash flows collected). The expected frequency, value and timing of trades. The business model assessment is based on reasonably expected scenarios without taking 'worst case' or 'stress case' scenarios into account.\" The Company also assesses the contractual terms of financial assets on the basis of its contractual cash flow characteristics that are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding. 'Principal' is defined as the fair value of the financial asset at initial recognition and may change over the life of the financial asset (for example, if there are repayments of principal or amortisation of the premium/discount). In making this assessment, the Company considers whether the contractual cash flows are consistent with a basic lending arrangement i.e. interest includes only consideration for the time value of money, credit risk, other basic lending risks and a profit margin that is consistent with a basic lending arrangement. Where the contractual terms introduce exposure to risk or volatility that are inconsistent with a basic lending arrangement, the related financial asset is classified and measured at fair value through profit or loss. Sales that are infrequent and insignificant in value both individually and in aggregate are considered to be consistent with the business model whose objective is to hold and collect the contractual cash flows. The Company classifies its financial liabilities at amortised costs unless it has designated liabilities at fair value through the profit and loss account or is required to measure liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. (ii) Financial assets Initial recognition and measurement All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, except in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value through profit or loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset. Subsequent measurement - Financial assets measured at amortised cost A 'debt instrument' is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met: a) The asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and b) Contractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely for the payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\" After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the Effective Interest Rate method (EIR). Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included in fee and commission income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. These financial assets comprise bank balances, trade receivables, loans and other financial assets. Subsequent measurement - Financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income Debt instruments A 'debt instrument' is classified as at the Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI) if both of the following criteria are met: a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets, and b) The asset's contractual cash flows represent Solely Payment of Principal and Interest(SPPI).101 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses and reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity to Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method. Equity Instruments All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 are measured at fair value. For all such equity investments, the Company may make an irrevocable election to present in OCI the subsequent changes in the fair value. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The classification is made on initial recognition and is irrevocable. If the Company decides to classify an equity instrument at FVTOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts from OCI to Statement of Profit and Loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity instruments included within the Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL) category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Subsequent measurement - Items at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL is a residual category for debt instruments. Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified at FVTPL. In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI criteria, at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or recognition inconsistency (referred to as 'accounting mismatch'). Debt instruments included within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss. (iii) Financial Liabilities Initial recognition and measurement All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value and, in the case of loans and borrowings and payables, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Company's financial liabilities include borrowings including Company overdrafts and trade and other payables. Subsequent measurement The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification. After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss. (iv) Recognition and Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities Recognition: A financial asset or financial liability is recognised in the balance sheet when the Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument, which is generally on trade date. Loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced (or settled) to the borrowers. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are recognised initially at fair value. All other financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.\" Derecognition: Financial assets A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a financial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) is primarily derecognised when: (a) The right to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or (b) The Company has transferred its right to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a 'pass-through' arrangement and either (i) the Company has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (ii) the Company has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.\" Financial Liabilities A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced 102 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. (v) Impairment of financial assets In accordance with Ind AS 109, the Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for measurement and recognition of impairment loss on the following financial assets and credit risk exposure: a) Financial assets that are debt instruments are measured at amortised cost e.g., loans, debt securities, deposits, and other balances b) Financial assets that are measured as at FVTOCI c) Loan commitments which are not measured as at FVTPL d) Financial guarantee contracts which are not measured as at FVTPL. For recognition of impairment loss on other financial assets and risk exposure, the Company determines that whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk since initial recognition. If credit risk has not increased significantly, 12-month ECL is used to provide for impairment loss. However, if credit risk has increased significantly, lifetime ECL is used. If, in a subsequent period, credit quality of the instrument improves such that there is no longer a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition, then the entity reverts to recognising impairment loss allowance based on 12-month ECL. The Company has established a policy to perform an assessment at the end of each reporting period of whether credit risk has increased significantly since initial recognition by considering the change in the risk of default occurring over the remaining life of the financial instrument. To calculate ECL, the Company estimate the risk of a default occurring on the financial instrument during its expected life. ECLs are estimated based on the present value of all cash shortfalls over the remaining expected life of the financial asset i.e., the difference between the contractual cash flows that are due to the Company under the contract, and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive are discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan. The Company groups its loans into Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3, based on the applied impairment methodology, as described below: Stage 1: 12-months ECL For exposures where there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition and that are not credit impaired upon origination, the portion of the lifetime ECL associated with the probability of default events occurring within the next 12 months is recognised. Stage 2: Lifetime ECL - not credit impaired For exposures where there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition but are not credit impaired, a lifetime ECL (i.e. reflecting the remaining lifetime of the financial asset) is recognised. Stage 3: Lifetime ECL - credit impaired Exposures are assessed as credit impaired when one or more events that have a detrimental impact on the estimated future cash flows of that asset have occurred. For exposures that have become credit impaired, a lifetime ECL is recognised and interest revenue is calculated by applying the effective interest rate to the amortised cost (net of provision) rather than the gross carrying amount.\" ECL impairment loss allowance (or reversal) during the period is recognized as income/ expense in the statement of profit and loss. This amount is reflected under the head 'Impairment on financial instruments' in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On the other side, for financial assets measured as at amortised cost, ECL is presented as an allowance, i.e., as an integral part of the measurement of those assets in the balance sheet. The allowance reduces the net carrying amount. Until the asset meets write-off criteria, the Company does not reduce impairment allowance from the gross carrying amount. In terms of the requirement as per RBI notification no. RBI/2019-20/170 DOR (NBFC).CC.PD. No.109/22.10.106/2019-20 dated 13th March 2020 on Implementation of Indian Accounting Standards, Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) are required to create an impairment reserve for any shortfall in impairment allowances under Ind AS 109 and Income Recognition, Asset Classification and Provisioning (IRACP) norms (including provision on standard assets). The impairment allowances under Ind AS 109 made by the company exceeds the total provision required under IRACP (including standard asset provisioning), as at 31st March 2021 and accordingly, no amount is required to be transferred to impairment reserve. (vi) Offsetting of financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet if 103 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS there is a currently enforceable legal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously. (vii) Write-offs The Company reduces the gross carrying amount of a financial asset when the Company has no reasonable expectations of recovering a financial asset in its entirety or a portion thereof. This is generally the case when the Company determines that the borrower does not have assets or sources of income that could generate suf ficient cash flows to repay the amounts subjected to write-offs. The Company reserves the right to recover such written off amount. Any subsequent recoveries against such loans are credited to the statement of pro fit and loss. (viii) Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedge Accounting: The Company enters into forward contracts to hedge the foreign currency risk of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss immediately unless the derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the Statement of Profit and Loss depends on the nature of the hedging relationship and the nature of the hedged item. The Company enters into derivative financial instruments viz. foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks. The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. Hedge Accounting: The Company designates certain hedging instruments in respect of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk as cash flow hedges. Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows, and are assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which they were designated. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of the designated portion of derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Amounts previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in other equity relating to (effective portion as described above) are re-classified to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, such gains and losses are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability. Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, terminated, or exercised, without replacement or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and accumulated in other equity at that time remains in other equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in other equity is recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. (ix) Determination of fair value On initial recognition, all the financial instruments are measured at fair value. For subsequent measurement, the Company measures certain categories of financial instruments (as explained in note 5.1 (ii) and (iii)) at fair value on each balance sheet date. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either: In the principal market for the asset or liability, or In the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or liability The principal or the most advantageous market must be accessible by the Company. The fair value of an asset or a liability is measured using the assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset or liability, assuming that market participants act in their economic best interest. A fair value measurement of a non-financial asset takes into account a market participant's ability to generate economic benefits by using the asset in 104 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in its highest and best use. The Company uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient data are available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. All assets and liabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the financial statements are categorised within the fair value hierarchy, described as follows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole: Level 1 \u2014 Quoted (unadjusted) market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 2 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is directly or indirectly observable Level 3 \u2014 Valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement is unobservable\" For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Company determines whether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by re-assessing categorisation at the end of each reporting period. 5.2 Revenue from operations (i) Interest Income For all debt instruments measured either at amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income, interest income is recorded using the EIR. EIR is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash payments or receipts over the expected life of the financial instrument or a shorter period, where appropriate, to the gross carrying amount of the financial asset or to the amortised cost of a financial liability. When calculating the effective interest rate, the Company estimates the expected cash flows by considering all the contractual terms of the financial instrument (for example, prepayment, extension, call and similar options) but does not consider the expected credit losses. Any subsequent changes in the estimation of the future cash flows is recognised in interest income with the corresponding adjustment to the carrying amount of the assets. Interest income on credit impaired assets is recognised by applying the effective interest rate to the net amortised cost (net of provision) of the financial asset. (ii) Dividend Income Dividend income is recognised a. When the right to receive the payment is established which is generally when shareholders approve the dividend, b. it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the dividend will flow to the entity and c. the amount of the dividend can be measured reliably (iii) Rental Income Rental income arising from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In cases where the increase is in line with expected general inflation. Rental Income is recognised as per the contractual terms. Operating leases are leases where the Company does not transfer substantially all of the risk and benefits of ownership of the asset. (iv) Fees & Commission Income Fees and commissions are recognised when the Company satisfies the performance obligation, at fair value of the consideration received or receivable based on a five-step model as set out below, unless included in the effective interest calculation: Step 1: Identify contract(s) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or more parties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that must be met. Step 2: Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contract with a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer. Step 3: Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excluding amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract. For a contract that has more than one performance obligation, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation in an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for satisfying each performance obligation.105 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the Company satisfies a performance obligation. (v) Net gain on Fair value changes Any differences between the fair values of financial assets classified as fair value through the profit or loss (refer Note 35), held by the Company on the balance sheet date is recognised as an unrealised gain / loss. In cases there is a net gain/loss in the aggregate, the same is recognised in \"Net gains on fair value changes\" under Revenue from operations in the statement of Profit and Loss. Similarly, any realised gain or loss on sale of financial instruments measured at FVTPL is recognised in net gain / loss on fair value changes. Similarly, any differences between the fair values of financial assets classified as fair value through other comprehensive income are disclosed in the OCI. However, net gain / loss on derecognition of financial instruments classified as amortised cost is presented separately under the respective head in the Statement of Profit and Loss. 5.3 Expenses (i) Finance Costs Finance costs represents Interest expense recognised by applying the EIR to the gross carrying amount of financial liabilities other than financial liabilities classified as FVTPL. Interest expense includes issue costs that are initially recognized as part of the carrying value of the financial liability and amortized over the expected life using the effective interest method. These include fees and commissions payable to advisers and other expenses such as external legal costs, provided these are incremental costs that are directly related to the issue of a financial liability. (ii) Retirement and other employee benefits Short term employee benefit All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee benefits. These benefits include short term compensated absences such as paid annual leave. The undiscounted amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by employees is recognised as an expense during the period. Benefits such as salaries and wages, etc. and the expected cost of the bonus/ex-gratia are recognised in the period in which the employee renders the related service. Post employment employee benefit a) Defined contribution schemes The Company makes defined contribution to Government managed Employee Provident Fund, Government managed Employee Pension Fund, Employee Deposit Linked Insurance, Employee State Insurance and Superannuation Schemes which are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss on accrual basis. Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognised as an expense when employee have rendered the service entitling them to the contribution. If the contribution payable to the scheme for service received before the Balance Sheet date exceeds the contribution already paid, the deficit payable to the scheme is recognised as a liability after deducting the contribution already paid. If the contribution already paid exceeds the contribution due for services received before the Balance Sheet date, then excess is recognised as an asset to the extent that the pre-payment will lead to, for example, a reduction in future payment or a cash refund. b) Defined benefit expenses The Company's liabilities under Payment of Gratuity Act and long term compensated absences are determined on the basis of actuarial valuation made at the end of each financial year using the projected unit credit method. Actuarial gain and losses are recognised immediately in Statement of Profit and Loss as income or expense. Obligation is measured at the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discounted rate that is determined by reference to market yields at the Balance Sheet date on Government bonds where the currency and terms of the Government bonds are consistent with the currency and estimated terms of the defined benefit obligation. The Company presents the entire leave as a provision in the Balance Sheet, since it does not have any unconditional right to defer its settlement for twelve months after the reporting date. Remeasurements, comprising of actuarial gains and losses, the effect of the asset ceiling, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined benefit liability and the return on plan assets (excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined 106 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |benefit liability), are recognised immediately in the balance sheet with a corresponding debit or credit to retained earnings through OCI in the period in which they occur. Remeasurements are not reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods. Past service costs are recognised in profit or loss at the earliest of: The date of the plan amendment or curtailment, and The date that the Company recognises related restructuring costs Net interest is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net defined benefit liability or asset. The Company recognises the following changes in the net defined benefit obligation under employee benefit expenses in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Service costs comprising current service costs, past-service costs, gains and losses on curtailments and non-routine settlements, Net interest expense or income. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ from actual developments in the future. These include the determination of the discount rate, attrition rate, future salary increases and mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. Other long-term employee benefits Company's liabilities towards compensated absences to employees are accrued on the basis of valuations, as at the Balance Sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary using Projected Unit Credit Method. Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions and are recognised immediately in the Statement of Profit and Loss. The Company presents the Provision for compensated absences under provisions in the Balance Sheet. (iii) Rent expense In case of short term leases and leases for which the underlying asset is of low value, the company has elected not to apply the requirements of Ind AS 116 and the lease payments associated with those leases are recognised as rent expense on a straight line basis. (iv) Leases The Company as a lessee The Company's lease assets primarily consist of leases for land and buildings. The Company assesses whether a contract contains a lease, at inception of a contract. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Company assesses whether: (1) the contract involves the use of an identified asset (2) the Company has substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset through the period of the lease and (3) the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. At the date of commencement of the lease, the Company recognizes right - of - use (\"ROU\") asset and a corresponding lease liability for all lease arrangements in which it is a lessee, except for leases with a term of twelve months or less (short- term leases) and low value leases. For these short- term and low value leases, the Company recognizes the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain lease arrangements includes the options to extend or terminate the lease before the end of the lease term. ROU assets and lease liabilities includes these options when it is reasonably certain that they will be exercised. The right-of-use assets are initially recognized at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or prior to the commencement date of the lease plus any initial direct costs less any lease incentives. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated from the commencement date on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term and useful life of the under lying asset. Right of use assets are evaluated for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and the value in use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset generates cash flows that are largely dependent of those from other assets. In such cases, the recoverable amount is determined for the Cash Generating Unit (CGU) to which the asset belongs.107 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The lease liability is initially measured at amortised cost at the present value of the future lease payments. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if not readily determinable, using the incremental borrowing rates in the country of domicile of the leases. Lease liabilities are remeasured with a corresponding adjustment to the related right of use asset if the Company changes its assessment on exercise of an extension or a termination option. Lease liability and ROU asset have been separately presented in the Balance Sheet and lease payments have been classified as financing cash flows. The following is the summary of practical expedients elected on initial application: 1. Applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases of similar assets in similar economic environment with a similar end date. 2. Applied the exemption not to recognize right- of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term on the date of initial application. 3. Excluded the initial direct costs from the measurement of the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application. 4. Applied the practical expedient to grandfather the assessment of which transactions are leases. Accordingly for all contracts as on 1st April 2019, Ind AS 116 is applied only to contracts that were previously identified as leases under Ind AS 17. The weighted average incremental borrowing rate applied to lease liabilities as at 1st April 2020 is between the range of 6.72% p.a. to 7.15% p.a. for a period varying from 1 to 10 years. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Critical judgements required in the application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, the following: Identifying whether a contract (or part of a contract) includes a lease; Determining whether it is reasonably certain that an extension or termination option will be exercised; Classification of lease agreements (when the entity is a lessor); Determination of whether variable payments are in substance fixed; Establishing whether there are multiple leases in an arrangement; Determining the stand-alone selling prices of lease and non-lease components. Key sources of estimation uncertainty in the application of Ind AS 116 may include, among others, the following: Estimation of the lease term; Determination of the appropriate rate to discount the lease payments; Assessment of whether a right-of-use asset is impaired. (v) Other income and expenses All Other income and expense are recognized in the period they occur. (vi) Impairment of non-financial assets The carrying amounts of non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date if there is any indication of impairment based on internal/external factors. An asset is treated as impaired when the carrying cost of the assets exceeds its recoverable value. The recoverable amount is the greater of the assets, net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re flects current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the asset. In determining net selling price, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identi fied, an appropriate valuation model is used. After impairment, depreciation is provided on the revised carrying amount of the asset over its remaining useful life. An impairment loss, if any, is charged to the Statement of Profit and Loss in the year in which an asset is identified as impaired. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. Such reversal is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.\" (vii) Borrowing Cost Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction, or production of a 108 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |qualifying asset are capitalised as a part of the cost of such asset till such time the asset is ready for its intended use. A qualifying asset is an asset that necessarily requires a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they occur at amortised cost using Effective Interest Rate (EIR). Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with borrowing funds. (viii) Taxes Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior years are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from, or paid to, the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted, or substantively enacted, by the reporting date in the countries where the company operates and generates taxable income. Current income tax relating to items recognised directly in equity is recognised in equity and not in the statement of profit or loss. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where appropriate. Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes at the reporting date. The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each reporting date and are recognised to the extent that it becomes probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss account is recognised either in OCI or in equity. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in Other Comprehensive Income (OCI) or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. (ix) Functional and presentational currency The financial statements are presented in Indian rupees (rounded to the nearest lakhs) which is determined to be the functional currency of the Company and the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company operates. 5.4 Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalent in the balance sheet and for the purpose of statement of cash flows comprise cash at bank and cheques in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are held for the purposes of meeting short-term cash commitments (rather than for investment or other purposes). 5.5 Property, Plant and Equipments All items of property, plant and equipments are stated at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation and impairment loss if any. The cost comprises the purchase price and any attributable cost of bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognised is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. The date of disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is the date the recipient obtains control of that item in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is satisfied in Ind AS 115. Depreciation methods, estimated useful lives and residual value Depreciation on the property, plant and equipments is provided on straight line method using the rates arrived as per estimates made by the management supported by 109 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS technical assessment which coincides with the useful lives of assets as specified in Schedule II to the Companies Act, 2013, except for the assets specified below. The Company has used the following useful lives of the property, plant and equipments to provide depreciation. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows: AssetUseful Life as Prescribed by Schedule II of the Companies Act, 2013Estimated Useful Life by Company Office Computers and Electronic Equipments (including Plant & Machinery)3 Years 4 Years Vehicles 8 Years 5 Years Furniture, Fixtures and Other Office Equipments10 Years 7 Years Leasehold Improvements Over the primary period of the lease3 Years Useful life of assets different from prescribed in Schedule II has been estimated by management supported by technical assessment. Depreciation on assets acquired / sold during the year is recognised on a pro-rata basis to the Statement of Profit and Loss from/ till the date of acquisition or sale. The residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation of property, plant and equipments are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. 5.6 Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is their fair value at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses if any. Intangible assets are amortised on straight line basis over a period of 3 years. The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as finite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life are reviewed at least at the end of each reporting period. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset are considered to modify the amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates. The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss unless such expenditure forms part of carrying value of another asset. Gains or losses from derecognition of intangible assets are measured as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss when the asset is derecognised. 5.7 Provisions and Contingencies Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. When the Company expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example, under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense relating to a provision is presented in the Statement of Profit and Loss net of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, when appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost. 5.8 Contingent Liabilities A contingent liability is a possible obligation that arises from past events whose existence will be con firmed by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events beyond the control of the Company or a present obligation that is not recognized because it is not probable that an out flow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. A contingent liability also arises in extremely rare cases where there is a liability that cannot be recognized because it cannot be measured reliably. The Company does not recognize a contingent liability but discloses its existence in the fi nancial statements. 5.9 Earnings Per Share The Company reports basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with Ind AS 33 on Earnings per share. Basic earnings per share (EPS) is calculated by dividing the net profit for the year attributable to ordinary equity holders of Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year. Diluted EPS is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of Company (after 110 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |adjusting for interest on the convertible preference shares and interest on the convertible bond, in each case, inclusive of tax) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares. 5.10 Segment Reporting Operating business segment results are reviewed regularly by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assess their performance. Business segment is the primary segment comprising of 'Financing activity'. As the Company operates only in a single business segment, no segment information thereof is given as required under Ind AS 108. 5.11 Dividend The Company recognises a liability to make dividend distributions to equity holders when the distribution is authorised and the distribution is no longer at the discretion of the Company. As per the corporate laws in India, a distribution is authorised when it is approved by the shareholders. A corresponding amount is recognised directly in equity or Statement of profit or loss account. 5.12 Business Combination under Common Control A common control business combination, involving entities or businesses in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties both before and after the business combination and where the control is not transitory, is accounted for in accordance with Appendix C to Ind AS 103 'Business Combinations'. Business combinations involving entities or businesses under common control are accounted for using the pooling of interest method as follows: The assets and liabilities of the combining entities are reflected at their carrying amounts. No adjustments are made to reflect fair values, or recognize new assets or liabilities. Adjustments are made only to harmonize significant accounting policies. The financial information in the financial statements in respect of prior periods are restated as if the business combination had occurred from the beginning of the preceding period in the financial statements, irrespective of the actual date of the combination. The identity of the reserves are preserved and appear in the financial statements of the transferee in the same form in which they appeared in the financial statements of the transferor. The difference, if any, between the amounts recorded as share capital issued plus any additional consideration in the form of cash or other assets and the amount of share capital of the transferor is transferred to capital reserve and is presented separately from other capital reserves with disclosure of its nature and purpose in the notes.\" 6 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS The preparation of fi nancial statements in conformity with Ind AS requires the management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the accompanying disclosure and the disclosure of contingent liabilities, at the end of the reporting period. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods are affected. Although these estimates are based on the management's best knowledge of current events and actions, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in the outcomes requiring a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities in future periods. In particular, information about signi ficant areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most signi ficant effect on the amounts recognized in the fi nancial statements is included in the following notes: 6.1 Business Model Assessment Classification and measurement of financial assets depends on the results of the SPPI and the business model test. The Company determines the business model at a level that reflects how groups of financial assets are managed together to achieve a particular business objective. This assessment includes judgement reflecting all relevant evidence including how the performance of the assets is evaluated and their performance measured, the risks that affect the performance of the assets and how these are managed and how the managers of the assets are compensated. The Company monitors financial assets measured at amortised cost or fair value through other comprehensive income that are derecognised prior to their maturity to understand the reason for their disposal and whether the reasons are consistent with the objective of the business for which the asset was held. Monitoring is part of the Company's continuous assessment of whether the business model for which the remaining financial assets are held continues to be appropriate and if it is not 111 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS appropriate whether there has been a change in business model and so a prospective change to the classification of those assets. 6.2 Estimation of defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) Refer Note 5.3 (ii) 6.3 Fair value measurement: When the fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded in the balance sheet cannot be measured based on quoted prices in active markets, their fair value is measured using various valuation techniques. The inputs to these models are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported fair value of fi nancial instruments. 6.4 Impairment of loans portfolio The measurement of impairment losses across all categories of financial assets requires judgement, in particular, the estimation of the amount and timing of future cash flows and collateral values when determining impairment losses and the assessment of a significant increase in credit risk. These estimates are driven by a number of factors, changes which can result in different levels of allowances. It has been the Company's policy to regularly review its models in the context of actual loss experience and adjust when necessary. The impairment loss on loans and advances is disclosed in more detail in Note 11. 6.5 Provisions other than impairment on loan portfolio and contingent liabilities The Company operates in a regulatory and legal environment that, by nature, has a heightened element of litigation risk inherent to its operations. As a result, it is involved in various litigation, arbitration and proceedings in the ordinary course of the Company's business. When the Company can reliably measure the outflow of economic benefits in relation to a specific case and considers such outflows to be probable, the Company records a provision against the case. Where the probability of outflow is considered to be remote, or probable, but a reliable estimate cannot be made, a contingent liability is disclosed. Given the subjectivity and uncertainty of determining the probability and amount of losses, the Company takes into account a number of factors including legal advice, the stage of the matter and historical evidence from similar incidents. Significant judgement is required to conclude on these estimates.\" 6.6 Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method The Company's EIR methodology, recognises interest income / expense using a rate of return that represents the best estimate of a constant rate of return over the expected behavioural life of loans given / taken and recognises the effect of potentially different interest rates at various stages and other characteristics of the product life cycle (including prepayments and penalty interest and charges). This estimation, by nature, requires an element of judgement regarding the expected behaviour and life-cycle of the instruments, as well expected changes to India's base rate and other fee income/expense that are integral parts of the instrument. 6.7 Recognition of deferred tax assets for carried forward losses Refer Note 5.3 (viii) 6.8 Estimation of useful life of property, plant and equipments and intangible assets Refer note 5.5 and 5.6112 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |NOTE 7: CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ` in Lakh ParticularsAs at 31st March 2021As at 31st March 2020 Balances with bank in - Fixed Deposits (with original maturity less than 3 months) - 22,294.66 - Current Accounts 1,51,098.56 1,59,747.87 Cheques in hand - - Total 1,51,098.56 1,82,042.53 NOTE 8: BANK BALANCE OTHER THAN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ` in Lakh ParticularsAs at 31st March 2021As at 31st March 2020 - Fixed Deposits (with original maturity more than 3 months) 1,913.09 - Total 1,913.09 - NOTE 9: DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into derivatives for risk management purposes.

The primary risks managed using derivative instruments are foreign currency risk and interest rate risk. The Company's risk management strategy and how it is applied to manage risk are explained in Note 51. Note 9.2: Derivatives designated as hedging instruments Cash flow hedges The Company is exposed to foreign currency risk arising from its External Commercial borrowings amounting to 1,46,367.54 Lakhs. Interest on the borrowing is payable at a floating rate. The Company economically hedged the foreign currency risk arising from the debt with a 'receive floating pay fixed' cross-currency interest rate swap ('swap'). The notional amount of swap is discosed in the table below. The swap contract converts the cash outflows of the foreign currency borrowing as per table below to cash outflows in INR with a notional amount of 1,46,367.54 lakhs at fixed interest rate.113 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ` in Lakh Name of LenderForeign Currency Denominated Borrowing AmountInterest rate typeNotional Amount of swap ()Interest rate swap type As at 31st March 2021 JPY Denominated (in JPY lakhs) (Maturity range: September 2022 to February 2023) 1,89,366.25 Floating rate interest 1,24,089.54 Fixed rate interest USD Denominated (Maturity March 2023) 300.00 Floating rate interest 22,278.00 Fixed rate interest Total 1,46,367.54 ` in Lakh Name of LenderForeign Currency Denominated Borrowing AmountInterest rate typeNotional Amount of swap ()Interest rate swap type As at 31st March 2020 JPY Denominated (in JPY lakhs) (Maturity range: September 2022 to February 2023) 1,89,366.25 Floating rate interest 1,24,089.54 Fixed rate interest USD Denominated (Maturity March 2023) 300.00 Floating rate interest 22,278.00 Fixed rate interest Total 1,46,367.54 There is an economic relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument as the terms of the cross currency swap contract match that of the foreign currency borrowing (notional amount, interest payment dates, principal repayment date etc.). The Company has established a hedge ratio of 1:1 for the hedging relationships as the underlying risk of the cross currency swap are identical to the hedged risk components. The hedge ineffectiveness can arise mainly if there is a change in the credit risk of the Company or the counterparty.

The reserve is utilised in accordance with provisions of the Companies Act, 2013. Special Reserve: Special reserve represents the reserve created pursuant to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 (the RBI Act). Appropriation from this Reserve Fund is permitted only for the purposes specified by RBI. Capital Reserve: Capital reserve refers to difference on account of net assets taken over and purchase consideration paid for merger of wealth management undertaking of Aditya Birla Money Mart Limited with the Company and the difference on account of net assets taken over and purchase consideration paid for merger of transaction business of Aditya Birla Capital Technology Services Limited, ABCTSL (formerly known as Aditya Birla My Universe Limited, ABMUL) undertaking with the Company. General Reserve: This reserve is created on account of merger. As per court order, this reserve can be utilised for distribution of dividends. FVTOCI Investments: The Company has elected to recognise changes in the fair value of certain instruments in equity securities and debt instruments in other comprehensive income. These changes are accumulated with the FVTOCI reserve within equity. The Company transfers amounts from this reserve to retained earnings when the relevant equity securities are de-recognised. Retained Earnings: Retained earnings refer to the percentage of net earnings not paid out as dividends, but retained by the Company to be reinvested in its core business, or to pay debts. Cash flow hedge reserve: The Company uses hedging instruments as part of its management of foreign currency risk and interest rate risk associated on borrowings. For hedging foreign currency and interest rate risk, the Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps. To the extent these hedges are effective, the change in fair value of the hedging instrument is recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve. Amounts recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve is reclassified to the statement of profit or loss when the hedged item affects profit or loss (e.g. interest payments). Capital Redemption reserve: Preference shares of ` 10 Crore were redeemed at the Board meeting held on 30th January 2020. As per the provisions of Companies Act, 2013, the preference shares were redeemed out of the profits of the company and therefore a sum equivalent to the nominal amount of shares redeemed were transferred to capital redemption reserve.

NOTE 49: CAPITAL For the purpose of the Company's capital management, capital includes issued equity capital, share premium and all other reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company's capital management is to maximise the shareholder value. The Company manages its capital structure and makes adjustments in light of changes in economic conditions and the requirements of the financial covenants. The Company monitors capital using a capital adequacy ratio, which is weighted assets divided by total capital derived as per the RBI requirements. As per the RBI guidelines, Company being a Non Banking Finance Company has to maintain 15% of capital adequacy ratio. The actual Capital Adequacy Ratio is as under: Particulars 31st March 2021 31st March 2020 Capital Adequacy Ratio 22.70% 19.08% In order to achieve this overall objective, the Company's capital management, amongst other things, aims to ensure that it meets financial covenants attached to the interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Breaches in meeting the financial covenants would permit the bank to immediately call loans and borrowings. There have been no breaches in the financial covenants of any interest-bearing loans and borrowing in the current year.145 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during the years ended 31st March 2021 and 31st March 2020. NOTE 50: FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price (fair value of the consideration given or received). Subsequent to initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of financial instruments that are quoted in active markets using the quoted bid prices (financial assets held) or quoted ask prices (financial liabilities held) and using valuation techniques for other instruments. Valuation techniques include discounted cash flow method, market comparable method, recent transactions happened in the company and other valuation models. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction in the principal (or most advantageous) market at the measurement date under current market conditions (i.e., an exit price), regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using a valuation technique. In order to show how fair values have been derived, financial instruments are classified based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques, as explained below: Level 1: Level 1 hierarchy includes financial instruments measured using quoted prices. This includes listed equity instruments, units of mutual funds (open ended) and traded bonds that have quoted price. The fair value of all equity instruments (including bonds) which are traded in the stock exchanges is valued using the closing price as at the reporting period. Level 2 : The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined using valuation techniques which maximise the use of observable market data and rely as little as possible on entity specific estimates. If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2. Level 3: If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3. Fair Value Hierarchy of assets and liabilities- Fair Value measurement- I. The carrying amount and fair value measurement hierarchy for assets and liabilities as at 31st March 2021 is as follows: Assets valued at fair value on a recurring basis ParticularsFair Value through profit and loss Carrying Value Fair Value Level-1 Level-2 Level-3 Total Quoted investments MOIL Limited 36.82 36.82 Securities 15,420.71 15,420.71 - 15,420.71 - 15,420.71 Funds 6,729.83 6,729.83 - - 6,729.83 Investment in Debt Securities 56,892.50 56,892.50 56,892.50 - - 56,892.50 Derivative (3,063.81) - (3,063.81) - (3,063.81) ParticularsFair Value through other comprehensive income Carrying Value Fair Value Level-1 Level-2 Level-3 Total Equity Share Birla Management Centre Services Limited 211.04 211.04 - - 211.04 211.04 146 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |II.

Such instruments are classified as Level 1. Units held in funds are measured based on their published net asset value(NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other restrictions. Such instruments are also classified as Level 1. Unlisted equity securities are classified at Level 3. Investment in Preference Shares: As per latest guideline issued by FBIL, the Preference shares which are not rated by a rating agency, the YTM method has been adopted. The preference shares are fair valued on the basis of YTM method, hence they are classified as Level 3. For the year ended March, 2020, the preference shares were fair valued on the basis of a similar compulsorily convertible preference shares issued by Tata Motors Finance Limited, hence they were classified as Level 3 for the year ended March, 2020. Investment in Govt Securities: The fair values of investments made in Government Securities is based on valuation report from ICRA as at the reporting period and the same are classified under Level 2. Investment in Alternate funds: Units held in funds of AIF are measured based on their published net asset value (NAV), taking into account redemption and/or other restrictions. Such instruments are generally Level 2. NAV represents the price at which the issuer will issue further units of AIF and the price at which issuers will redeem such units from the investors. Investment in Debt Securities and Bonds: Fair value of these instrument is derived based on the indicative quote of price and yields prevailing in the market as at reporting date. Company has used quoted price of national stock exchange wherever bonds are traded actively. In cases where debt securities are not actively traded company has used CRISIL corporate bond valuer model for measuring fair value i.e. fair value has been computed using the Fixed Income Money Market and Derivatives Association of India ('FIMMDA') data on corporate bond spreads. Derivative Financial Instruments: A generally accepted framework for the valuation of the swap explains the position in each leg of the swap as a 'bond'. Therefore, a receive fixed - pay floating swap can be viewed as a portfolio consisting a long position in fixed bond and short position a floating rate bond. The value of the swap is the net proceeds from such bond positions i.e. Receipt - Payment. The swaps were valued on and with inputs from Bloomberg database using the terms of the swap contract.147 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Equity shares measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income: Unquoted equity shares are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income on the basis of the net worth of the investee company and are classified as Level 3.

These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Short-term financial assets and liabilities For financial assets and financial liabilities that have a short-term maturity (less than twelve months), the carrying amounts, which are net of impairment, are a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Such amounts have been classified as Level 2 on the basis that no adjustments have been made to the balances in the balance sheet. Loans Loans can be categorized into two main categories based on the rate of interest charged on such loans: A) Floating rate Loans: Floating rate loans are loans in which the interest rates are reset at a periodic interval based on a pre-decided reference rate. B) Fixed Rate Loans: Fixed rate loans are loans in which the interest rates are decided at the time of sanction of the loan and are not reset automatically. Floating Rate Loans: The floating rate loans are valued on the basis of MCLR + Spread specific to the Company. This MCLR rate is being reset on periodic intervals based on the pre-decided reference rate. Hence, they are classified as Level 3. Fixed Rate Loans: 1. A fixed rate loan given can be viewed as a plain vanilla bond purchased that pays a fixed rate of interest and has fixed redemption date with no options or variable terms attached to it. Value of a Bond is equal to the present value of coupon payments and the redemption price discounted at the yield to maturity ('YTM') as on the Valuation Date of a similar loan. Accordingly, the Company has used the present value technique for valuation of the Fixed Rate Loans given by the Company. 2. In case of loans, they are considered as financial assets and the contractual cash flows are defined over the tenure of the loan. Since the loans are not traded in active markets and company does not have any active markets for identical assets, the Company has not used any level 1 inputs as per INDAS 113. The Company has used the prevailing risk free rate as the valuation date and the credit default spread based on FIMMDA-PDAI Gilt curve for Valuation of Corporate Bonds-Corporates Valuation Matrix, being a level 2 input, as on the valuation date; to determine the discount factor for arriving at the fair value of these loans using the present value technique.\"150 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |Borrowings Floating Rate Borrowings: The floating rate borrowings are valued on the basis of MCLR + Spread. Fixed Rate Borrowings: The methodology to arrive at yield and bond price is similar and is used in valuation for mutual fund industry. Trades reported may be analysed based on polls received and internal spread models of IMaCS to arrive at final yield for the security using the process mentioned below. 1. Last traded Yield/price that has been reported on NSE, BSE, MCX, FTRAC and NDS-OM is used for valuation as per existing rules for trade size and outliers used for Scrip level valuation. However polls are carried out for outliers trades. 2. In case above conditions are not met, yield is calculated considering trades in same issuer of similar maturity in line with overall market movement and market data collected. Polls may be carried out for outliers and for final valuation yield. 3. In case the above two conditions are not met, matrix movement(benchmark movement of relevant maturity bucket as analysed based on overall trades available/bid-ask and or poll on the similar securities shall be applied on previous day's yield to arrive at Yield/Price for the day. 4. If yield/price is not determinable based on above steps due to non-availability of data, outliers and/or such exceptional events, valuation shall be provided based on previous days Yield/Price. Derivative Liabilities (Hedging Instruments measured at fair value) 1. The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows based on observable yield curves and an appropriate discount factor. 2. The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated as the present value determined using forward exchange rates and interest rate curve of respective currencies. 3. The fair value of currency swap is calculated as the present value determined using forward exchange rates, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies, interest rate curves and an appropriate discount factor. NOTE 51: RISK MANAGEMENT (a) Financial risk management objectives and policies The Company's principal financial liabilities comprise borrowings and trade and other payables. The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to finance and support the company's operations. The Company's principal financial assets include loans, investments, cash and cash equivalents and other receivables that derive directly from its operations. The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Company's senior management oversees the management of these risks. The Company's senior management is supported by a Risk Management Committee that advises on financial risks and the appropriate financial risk governance framework for the Company. The Risk Committee provides assurance to the Company's senior management that the Company's financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risks are identified, measured and managed in accordance with the Company's policies and risk objectives. The Board of Directors review and agree policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below. The Company has identified and implemented comprehensive policies and procedures to assess, monitor and manage risk throughout the Company. The risk management process is continuously reviewed, improved and adapted in the changing risk scenario and the agility of the risk management process is monitored and reviewed for its appropriateness in the changing risk landscape. The process of continuous evaluation of risks includes taking stock of the risk landscape on an event-driven basis. The Company has an elaborate process for risk management. Major risks identified by the businesses and functions are systematically addressed through mitigating actions on a continuing basis.151 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Operational & Business Risk Loss of Risk that is related to activities carried out within an entity, arising from incomplete structure, failure of systems, untrained people, inefficient products or processes. To make the structure more robust a Board approved Operational Risk Management Framework has been put in place which is implemented by a dedicated team within the Risk Management function. A bottom up risk control self-assessment process identifies high risk areas, potential gaps and serves as an early warning system so that remedial measures can be initiated in a timely manner. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. In the case of the Company, market risk primarily comprises of interest rate risk. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings. The analyses exclude the impact of movements in market variables on the carrying values of gratuity, other post-retirement obligations and provisions. The sensitivity of the relevant profit or loss item is the effect of the assumed changes in respective market risks. This is based on the financial assets and financial liabilities held at 31st March 2021 and 31st March 2020. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. Interest rate sensitivity Since the Company manages its interest rate risk on domestic borrowings by ensuring, at maximum, its long term borrowings from domestic banks at floating rate of interest and in case of reduction in interest rate, it initiates negotiations with bankers for realigning the interest rate and/or repaying the high interest rate exposures, the interest rate change in market as such doesn't affect Company's profitability materially.

The Company's exposure to the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates primarily relates to its External Commercial Borrowings. The Company uses derivative instruments like forwards to hedge exposure to foreign currency risk. The Company has taken foreign currency floating rate borrowings, which are linked to LIBOR. For managing the foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, arising from changes in LIBOR on such borrowings, the Company has entered into Cross Currency Interest Rate Swap (CCIRS) and forward contracts for the entire loan liability and tenure of the facility. Under the terms of the CCIRS, the Company pays interest at the fixed rate to the swap counterparty in INR and receives the floating interest payments based on LIBOR in foreign currency. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the Company will incur a loss because its customers or counterparties fail to discharge their contractual obligations. The Company manages and controls credit risk by setting limits on the amount of risk it is willing to accept for individual counterparties and for geographical and industry concentrations, and by monitoring exposures in relation to such limits. The Company has established a credit quality review process to provide early identification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties, including regular collateral revisions. Counterparty limits are established by the use of a credit risk classification system, which assigns each counterparty a risk rating. Risk ratings are subject to regular revision. The credit quality review process aims to allow the Company to assess the potential loss as a result of the risks to which it is exposed and take corrective action.152 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited | Impairment assessment The ECL model Credit loss provisioning approach has now moved from incurred model. This forces entity to understand the significance of credit risk and its movement since its initial recognition. This model ensures (a) timely recognition of ECLs (b) assessment of significant increase in credit risk which will provide better disclosure (c) ascertainment of better business ratios. The references below show where the Company's impairment assessment and measurement approach is set out in this report. It should be read in conjunction with the Summary of significant accounting policies in Note 5. - An explanation of the Company's internal grading system (Note 'Definition of default and cure' below) - How the Company defines, calculates and monitors the probability of default, exposure at default and loss given default) (Note 'The Company's internal rating and PD estimation process', 'Probability of Default', 'Exposure at Default' below) - When the Company considers there has been a significant increase in credit risk of an exposure (Note 'Significant increase in credit risk' below) - The Company's policy of segmenting financial assets where ECL is assessed on a collective basis (Note 'Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis' below) - The details of the ECL calculations for Stage 1, Stage 2 and Stage 3 assets (Notes 'Probability of default', 'Exposure at default' and 'loss given default' below) Definition of default The Company considers a financial instrument defaulted and therefore Stage 3 (credit impaired) for ECL calculations in all cases when the borrower becomes 90 days past due on its contractual payments. As a part of a qualitative assessment of whether a customer is in default, the Company also considers a variety of instances that may indicate unlikeness to pay. When such events occur, the Company carefully considers whether the event should result in treating the customer as defaulted and therefore assessed as Stage 3 for ECL calculations or whether Stage 2 is appropriate. Such events include: a) Significant financial difficulty of the borrower or issuer; b) A breach of contract such as a default or past due event; c) The restructuring of a loan or advance by the company on terms that the company would not consider otherwise; d) It is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation; or e) The disappearance of an active market for a security because of financial difficulties and the customer has delay in his repayments over a month. The Company's internal rating and PD estimation process a. Internal Rating: A robust internal credit rating framework is vital for effective credit risk management. It is specified by RBI on credit risk management that lenders should have an internal rating framework and the lenders must have independent Credit Risk Control Units (CRCU) or equivalents that are responsible for the design or selection, implementation and performance of their internal rating systems. Accordingly the Company also have an internal rating framework developed along with CRISIL, with ratings being assigned to all the customer/ portfolio pool - (eligible customers for Ratings) and used extensively in internal decision-making. b. It is further specified in the policy that Internal rating/grading/scoring of the borrower/client is at least Investment grade rating as per the Company's internal credit rating model or valid/live external rating. Probability of Default(PD) PD is calculated basis likelihood that the borrower will default within one year horizon(Basis for Stage 1), For Stage 2 - it is defined as significant increase in credit risk and probability is defined as borrower's probability to default in lifetime. Exposure at Default Gross exposure/potential gross exposure under a facility (i.e. the amount that is legally owed to the lender) at the time of default by a borrower. Exposure at Default gives an estimate of the amount outstanding.153 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Loss Given Default(LGD) LGD is usually shown as the percentage of Exposure at Default that the lender might lose in case the borrower defaults. It depends, among others, on the type of collateral, it's value and the expected proceeds from the sale (e.g. sales proceeds from sales of collaterals/securities) of the assets, NPV net of recovery costs. Significant increase in credit risk a. There is significant increase in credit risk, when there is deterioration in account performance and expected resolution is not available. b. Further, for large borrowers after assessing the following Risks in totality and deterioration in each factor, it is then assessed whether there is a significant increase in credit risk i. Industry Risk ii. Business Risk iii. Management Risk iv. Financial Risk v. Banking Conduct & Facility level Conduct. c. Significant increase in credit risk is also gauged through Credit rating. Credit rating is an opinion of capacity of borrower to meet its financial obligations to the depositor or bondholder (i.e. lender of money) on a particular issue or type of instrument (i.e. a domestic or foreign currency: short-term or medium or long-term, etc.) in a timely manner. The rating measures the relative risk of an issuers ability and willingness to repay both interest and principal over the period of the rated instrument. i.e. rating signifies the risk of default of the borrower that is rated.\" Collateral Security: The Company's net exposure to credit risk, after taking into account credit risk mitigation, have been tabulated below: ParticularsAs at 31st March 2021 As OutstandingCash collateralNature of Non-cash collateralOutstandingCash collateralNature of Non-cash collateral Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 1,51,098.56 - 1,82,042.53 - Bank balance other than cash and cash equivalents1,913.09 - - - Derivative financial instruments- 5,408.39 Trade Receivables 998.86 - 1,195.36 - Loans 47,59,743.36 - Refer footnote below45,98,535.45 - Refer footnote below Investments 79,290.90 - 3,34,240.17 - Other financial assets 5,117.95 - 4,341.17 - Total 49,98,162.72 - 51,25,763.07 - The Company by way of loan sanction letter and other loan securing documents agrees with its customers on collateral security to be provided by the customers in secured loan exposures that are subject to credit risk. Collateral security enables us to recover all or part of the outstanding exposure by liquidating the collateral asset provided, in cases where the borrower is unable or unwilling to fulfil its primary obligations. Collateral security accepted by the Company could be in the form of: a) Financial collateral in the form of pledge of equity shares, units of mutual funds, assignment of life insurance policies; b) Current assets in the form of inventories meant for sale or receivables arising out of the sale of finished goods c) Fixed asset (in the form of immovable properties - real estate, Plant and Machinery, Equipment's) d) Third-party obligation (in the form of Irrevocable Unconditional Guarantee issued by Bank, Third party); 154 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited | e) Risk participation from Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises (CGTMSE) f) Assignment of borrower's rights and interests under agreements with third parties. In addition, the Company also stipulates escrow of cash flows and a Debt Service Reserve Account (DSRA) for project loans. Collateral serves to mitigate the inherent risk of credit loss in an exposure, by either improving recoveries in the event of a default or substituting the borrower. As part of the assessment of a credit transaction the availability, adequacy and suitability of collateral for the transaction is evaluated and decided upon. The Company's processes includes verification of the title to the collateral offered and valuation by technical experts where warranted. The Company accept as collateral only securities of good quality and have in place legally effective and enforceable documentation. For guarantee's taken, the guarantor's creditworthiness is assessed during the credit assessment process of the transaction. We have collateral type specific haircuts in place which are reviewed at intervals as appropriate to the type of collateral. The Company recognises that collateral can be a credit mitigant (alternative source of repayment), but does not replace or dilute the underwriting standards the company adopts to underwrite credit exposures. (b) Forward looking Information: The Company is required to provide for impairment allowance basis expected credit loss (ECL), which is calculated using empirical portfolio performance and adjusted for forward looking macroeconomic factors, as prescribed by Ind AS. The overall provisioning made through this approach, continues to be in excess of the floor provisions as prescribed by RBI for NBFCs. The assessment of credit risk and estimation of ECL is statistically validated. It considers all relevant information about past events, current conditions and some elements of predicted performance of the portfolio. ECL has been calculated using three main components: a probability of default (PD), a loss given default (LGD) and the exposure at default (EAD). In the process of determining the PD, the macro economic impact is intrinsically built in in our current approach. The overall performance through the life cycle of the loan, considers the impact of macro-economic parameters like GDP, Unemployment factor or once in events like de-monetisation etc. Most of the portfolios have seen one to two complete economic cycles and hence the default probabilities experienced by the Company takes into account the upturn, downturn and central (balanced) economic scenario. In the internally rated portfolio, the Industry rating module (sourced from CRISIL under agreement) recognizes factors like demand prediction, supply side glut / constraints, impact of imports and exports and the government policies which are more forward looking and making the through-the-cycle default probabilities to point-in-time default probability. Forward looking macro-economic factors as appropriate to the sub portfolios of the Company, that can demonstrate some degree of correlation to the forward looking default probability are being evaluated and will be adopted as the company concludes the revalidation exercise for the models to be used from FY 2021. For FY 2020, COVID - 19 impact has been considered and suitably modelled to forecast and provide for the future impact and a separate note on the same has been provided. Grouping financial assets measured on a collective basis The Company calculates ECLs either on a collective or an individual basis. Asset classes where the Company calculates ECL on an individual basis include: 1. Corporate Portfolio Asset classes where the Company calculates ECL on a collective basis include: 1. Retail Portfolio The ECL methodology allows for individual assessment for corporates and therefore these loans are generally measured individually as each of these exposures have unique characteristics and structuring. For retail exposures and exposures 155 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021FINANCIAL STATEMENTS which can be clubbed in homogenous pools, ECL is measured on a collective basis. This has been arrived at based on common characteristics like nature of product, customer profile etc. (c) Analysis of risk concentration Concentration analysis are presented for Portfolio pool, Location, Top borrower exposures, Group exposures etc. These are regularly analysed and presented for further review/action. Based on the exposures of the company towards various sectors, analysis is as follows: Top 20 Industry SectorsAs at 31st March 2021 (%)As at 31st March 2020 (%) Real Estate Activities - Builders and Contractors 14.67% 14.85% Lease Rental Discounting 6.76% 3.38% Education 3.28% 2.79% Textiles, Readymade Garments, and Trading 3.28% 4.13% NBFCs 3.10% 3.16% Transportation, logistics (Wholesale/ Retail) 2.92% 2.50% 1.54% Hospital 1.87% 1.85% Food & Beverages 1.68% 1.43% Brokers / Traders - Shares, securities 1.66% 1.37% & Distr 1.58% 1.32% 1.36% - equipments* 1.22% - Mining and Quarrying 1.05% 1.17% Finance - / Others** - 1.21% Business & Self-Employed** - 1.19% Top 20 Industry Exposures 69.10% 69.17% *Industry sector does not covered in Top 20 Industry sector for the year ended 31st March 2020. **Industry sector does not covered in Top 20 Industry sector for the year ended 31st March 2021. Note: Industry Sectors tagging on loans is done by the Company's management which have been relied upon by the auditors. (d) Liquidity risk and funding management Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset. Liquidity risk arises because of the possibility that the Company might be unable to meet its payment obligations when they fall due as a result of mismatches in the timing of the cash flows under both normal and stress circumstances. The Company manages its liquidity requirement by analysing the maturity pattern of Company's cash flows of financial assets and financial liabilities. The Asset Liability Management of the Company is periodically reviewed by its Asset Liability Management Committee. The Company maintains a portfolio of highly marketable and diverse assets that are assumed to be easily liquidated in the event of an unforeseen interruption in cash flow. The Company also has lines of credit that it can access to meet liquidity needs. In accordance with the Company's policy, the liquidity position is assessed under a variety of scenarios, giving due consideration to stress factors relating to both the market in general and specifically to the Company. Net liquid assets consist of cash. The ratios during the year were, as follows:156 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited | Advances 109.79% Borrowings from banks and financial institutions and issue of debentures are considered as important sources of funds to finance lending to customers. They are monitored using the advances to borrowings ratio, which compares loans and advances to customers as a percentage of secured and unsecured borrowings. Analysis of financial liabilities by remaining contractual maturities The table below summarises the maturity profile of the undiscounted cash flows of the Company's financial liabilities as at 31 March: As at 31st March 2021 Particulars Within 12 months After 12 months Total Financial liabilities Derivative Financial Liability - 3,063.81 3,063.81 Trade Payables (refer note 2 below) - Micro and small enterprises 214.66 - 214.66 - Other than micro and small enterprises 10,957.65 - 10,957.65 Debt securities (refer note 3 below) 7,88,481.19 11,87,415.93 19,75,897.12 Borrowings (other than Other financial liabilities 31,157.54 - 31,157.54 As at 31st March 2020 Particulars Within 12 months After 12 months Total Financial liabilities Derivative Financial Liability - 0.40 0.40 Trade Payables (refer note 2 below) - Micro and small enterprises 282.07 - 282.07 - Other than micro and small enterprises 10,184.87 - 10,184.87 Debt securities (refer note 3 below) 8,18,447.67 9,68,344.49 17,86,792.16 Borrowings (other than 11,403.74 - 11,403.74 Notes: 1.

The financial results, includes the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company's financial results which are dependent on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including, among other things, any new information concerning the severity of the second wave of COVID-19 pandemic and any action to contain its spread or mitigate its impact whether Government mandated or elected by the Company and its subsequent impact on the recoverability's on the Company's assets. The Company has, based on current available information and based on the policy approved by the Board, determined the provision for impairment of financial assets including the additional overlay for uncertainty over the potential macro- economic impact of the pandemic. Based on the current indicators of future economic conditions, the Company considers this provision to be adequate and expects to recover the carrying amount of these financial assets. Given the uncertainty over the potential macro-economic condition, the impact of the global health pandemic may be different from that estimated as at the date of approval of these financial statements and the Company will continue to closely monitor any material changes to future economic conditions. (f) Impact of Restructuring The economic fallout on account of the Covid-19 pandemic has led to significant financial stress for borrowers across the board. The resultant stress potentially impacted the long-term viability of many firms, otherwise having a good track record under the existing promoters, due to their debt burden becoming disproportionate relative to their cash flow generation abilities. Such wide spread impact could impair the entire recovery process, posing significant financial stability risks. Considering the above, with the intent to facilitate revival of real sector activities and mitigate the impact on the ultimate borrowers, RBI has decided to provide a window under the Prudential Framework to enable the lenders to implement a resolution plan in respect of eligible MSME, corporate exposures, Small borrowers and Personal Loans while classifying such exposures as Standard, subject to specified conditions. Under this framework, ABFL identified the customers that required handholding and were significantly impacted under the COVID related stress but who would bounce back if given the option to pay a lower instalment or payment holiday for 6 to 12 months. The Company has restructured only 2.46 % of the overall book and has taken adequate provisions against these loans.158 Notes Forming part of financial statements as on 31st March 2021Annual Report 2020-21 Aditya Birla Finance Limited |52A.
