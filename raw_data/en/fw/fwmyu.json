If cell division is not regulated properly we can have too much cell division, resulting in excessive cell growth, this phenomenon is the underlying mechanism of cancer and how tumors are produced. Cancer cells generated during abnormal cell division often have little to no differences in composition making treatment excessively difficult. Modern day medicine and medical procedures work by targeting all cells in the region the cancerous tumor has arisen, this kills both cancer and non-cancer cells leaving extensive side effects. [Sciencedaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/09/160908084319.htm) published research news on how Chinese medicine kills cancer cells from University of Adelaide. New research in therapeutics for cancer revolves around targeting specific cancer cells. Dr. Xinping Song from the 3D Urology and Prostate Clinic in China is in one lab looking to target these cells specifically. Research from the 3D prostate clinic has shown that ancient Chinese medicines could be a novel and [new prostate cancer](https://www.prostatecancer.vip/) treatment. [Researchers from Yale University and Columbia University](http://www.naturalnews.com/040444_Chinese_medicine_herbs_cancer.html) found that triptolide effectively triggers cancer cell apoptosis. Research out of the 3D Prostate treatment has been geared towards using ancient [traditional Herbal medicine](http://www.3dprostatecure.com/) for the apoptosis of cancer cells while leaving all other cells untouched. Two ancient Chinese medicines investigated by the 3D clinic lab include elemene emulsifications from rhizoma curcumae and ginseng. Principle results from the Dr. Xinping Song show that elemene could be a tumor suppressor, whereas ginseng shows promise in the recovery of patients after cancer cells have been eliminated. The 3d prostate clinic concludes that the use of active ingredients in [traditional Chinese medicines](https://www.prostatecancer.vip/) with or without the conjunction of Western medicine is a promising method to treat cancer induced tumors. Pharmacological studies still need to be done to understand any drug interactions/side effects that ancient Chinese medicine may have when paired with western pharmaceuticals, however, the research from the 3D treatments shows that there are ways to treat cancer without killing non-cancerous cells and reducing side effects.
