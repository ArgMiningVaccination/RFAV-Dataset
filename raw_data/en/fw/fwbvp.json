The Compendium of [Suruta](/wiki/Sushruta) is one of the foundational texts of [Ayurveda](/wiki/Ayurveda) (Indian traditional medicine), alongside the [Charaka-Sahit](/wiki/Charaka_Samhita), the [Bhela-Sahit](/wiki/Bhela_Samhita), and the medical portions of the [Bower Manuscript](/wiki/Bower_Manuscript). [[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999203-389_(Volume_IA)-1) [[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTER\u00e2y1980-2) It is one of the two foundational Hindu texts on the medical profession that have survived from ancient India. [[3]](#cite_note-3) [[4]](#cite_note-4) The Surutasahit is of great historical importance because it includes historically unique chapters describing surgical training, instruments and procedures which is still followed by modern science of surgery.

All serious consideration of this complex question must show awareness of this work. Meulenbeld stated that the Surutasahit is likely a work that includes several historical layers, whose composition may have begun in the last centuries BCE and was completed in its presently surviving form by another author who redacted its first five sections and added the long, final section, the \"Uttaratantra.\" [[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999203-389_(Volume_IA)-1) It is likely that the Suruta-sahit was known to the scholar [Dhabala](/wiki/D%E1%B9%9B%E1%B8%8Dhabala) (fl. 300-500 CE), which gives the latest date for the version of the work that has survived into the modern era. [[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999203-389_(Volume_IA)-1) In Surutasahit - A Scientific Synopsis, the historians of Indian science Ray, Gupta and Roy noted the following view, which is broadly the same as Meulenbeld's: [[9]](#cite_note-9) \"The Chronology Committee of the National Institute of Sciences of India (Proceedings, 1952), [[10]]was of the opinion that third to fourth centuries A. D. may be accepted as the date of the recension of the Suruta Sahit by Ngrjuna, which formed the basis of Dallaa's commentary.\" The above view remains the consensus amongst university scholars of the history of Indian medicine and Sanskrit literature. Hoernle's view[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=3)] Regrettably, given its subsequent influence, a century ago, the scholar [Rudolf Hoernle](/wiki/Rudolf_Hoernle) (1841 - 1918) proposed that because the author of [Satapatha Brahmana](/wiki/Satapatha_Brahmana), a Vedic text from the mid-first-millennium BCE, was aware of [Sushruta](/wiki/Sushruta)'s doctrines, Sushruta's doctrines should be dated based on the composition date of Satapatha Brahmana. [[11]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle19078-11) The composition date of the Brahmana was itself unclear, added Hoernle, but he estimated it to be about the sixth century BCE. [[11]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle19078-11) Unfortunately, Hoernle's date of 600 BCE for the Surutasahit continues to be widely and uncritically cited in spite of much intervening scholarship over the last century. Yet because of further research, scores of scholars have subsequently published more considered opinions on the date of the work, and these many views have been summarized by Meulenbeld in his History of Indian Medical Literature. [[12]](#cite_note-:1-12) Central to the problem of chronology is the fact that the Surutasahit is the work of several hands. The internal tradition recorded in manuscript colophons and by medieval commentators makes clear that an old version of the Surutasahit consisted of sections 1-5, with the sixth part having been added by a later author. However, the oldest manuscripts we have of the work already include the sixth section, called the Uttara-tantra. Manuscript colophons routinely call the whole work \"The Surutasahit together with the Uttara-tantra,\" reinforcing the idea that this was perceived as a five+one composition. Selected views on chronology[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=4)] As mentioned above, scores of scholars have proposed hypotheses on the formation and dating of the Surutasahit. [[12]](#cite_note-:1-12) The following are some of these views that broadly follow Hoernle's old 1907 publication. [[13]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle1907-13) Rao in 1985 suggested that the original layer to the Sushruta Samhita was composed in 1st millennium BCE by \"elder Sushruta\" consisting of five books and 120 chapters, which was redacted and expanded with Uttara-tantra as the last layer of text in 1st millennium CE, bringing the text size to six books and 184 chapters. [[14]](#cite_note-Rao-14) Walton et al., in 1994, traced the origins of the text to 1st millennium BCE. [[15]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEWalton1994586-15) Tipton in a 2008 historical perspectives review, states that uncertainty remains on dating the text, how many authors contributed to it and when. Estimates range from 1000 BCE, 800-600 BCE, 600 BCE, 600-200 BCE, 200 BCE, 1-100 CE, and 500 CE. [[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETipton20081553-1556-16) Partial resolution of these uncertainties, states Tipton, has come from a comparison of the Sushruta Samhita text with several Vedic hymns particularly the [Atharvaveda](/wiki/Atharvaveda) such as the hymn on the creation of man in its 10th book, [[17]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle1907109-111-17) the chapters of Atreya Samhita which describe the human skeleton, [[18]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBanerjee2011320-323-18) better dating of ancient texts that mention Sushruta's name, and critical studies on the ancient Bower Manuscript by Hoernle. [[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETipton20081553-1556-16) These information trace the first Sushruta Samhita to likely have been composed by about mid 1st millennium BCE. \"renowned\" [[20]](#cite_note-20)) is named in the text as the author, who is presented in later manuscripts and printed editions a narrating the teaching of his guru, Divodsa. [[21]](#cite_note-:0-21) [[22]](#cite_note-22) A person of this name is said in early texts such as the Buddhist [Jatakas](/wiki/Jataka_tales) to have been a physician who taught in a school in Kashi ( [Varanasi](/wiki/Varanasi)) in parallel to another medical school in Taxila (on Jhelum river), [[23]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle19077-8-23) [[24]](#cite_note-24) sometime between 1200 BCE and 600 BCE. [[25]](#cite_note-25) The earliest known mentions of the name Sushruta firmly associated with the tradition of the Surutasahit is in the [Bower Manuscript](/wiki/Bower_Manuscript) (4th or 5th century CE), where Sushruta is listed as one of the ten sages residing in the Himalayas. [[26]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKutumbian2005XXXII-XXXIII-26) [Rao](/wiki/S._K._Ramachandra_Rao) in 1985 suggested that the author of the original \"layer\" was \"elder Sushruta\" (Vrddha Sushruta), although this name appears nowhere in the early Sanskrit literature. The text, states Rao, was redacted centuries later \"by another Sushruta, then by Nagarjuna, and thereafter Uttara-tantra was added as a supplement\". [[14]](#cite_note-Rao-14) It is generally accepted by scholars that there were several ancient authors called \"Suruta\" who contributed to this text. [[27]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999347-350_(Volume_IA)-27) Affiliation[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=6)] The text has been called a Hindu text by many scholars. [[28]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBoslaugh2007547,_Quote:_\"The_Hindu_text_known_as_Sushruta_Samhita_(600_AD)_is_possibly_the_earliest_effort_to_classify_diseases_and_injuries\".-28) [[29]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESchultheisz198160-61,_Quote:_\"(...)_the_Charaka_Samhita_and_the_Susruta_Samhita,_both_being_recensions_of_two_ancient_traditions_of_the_Hindu_medicine.\"-29) [[30]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELoukas2010646,_Quote:_Susruta's_Samhita_emphasized_surgical_matters,_including_the_use_of_specific_instruments_and_types_of_operations._It_is_in_his_work_that_one_finds_significant_anatomical_considerations_of_the_ancient_Hindu.\"-30) The text discusses surgery with the same terminology found in more ancient Hindu texts, [[31]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle19078,_109-111-31) [[32]](#cite_note-32) mentions Hindu gods such as [Narayana](/wiki/Narayana), [Hari](/wiki/Hari), [Indra](/wiki/Indra) and others in its chapters, [[33]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1911156_etc-33) [[34]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna19076-7,_395_etc-34) refers to the scriptures of Hinduism namely the [Vedas](/wiki/Vedas), [[35]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1911157,_527,_531,_536_etc-35) [[36]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1907181,_304-305,_366,_lxiv-lxv_etc-36) and in some cases, recommends exercise, walking and \"constant study of the Vedas\" as part of the patient's treatment and recovery process. [[37]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1911377_etc-37) The text also uses terminology of [Samkhya](/wiki/Samkhya) and other of have religious ideas throughout, states Steven Engler, who then concludes \"Vedic elements are too central to be discounted as marginal\". [[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngler2003416-463-40) These ideas include the use of terms and same metaphors that are pervasive in the Hindu scriptures - the Vedas, and the inclusion of theory of [Karma](/wiki/Karma), self ( [Atman](/wiki/Atman_(Hinduism))) and [Brahman](/wiki/Brahman) (metaphysical reality) along the lines of those found in ancient Hindu texts. [[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngler2003416-463-40) However, adds Engler, the text also includes another layer of ideas, where empirical rational ideas flourish in competition or cooperation with religious ideas. [[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngler2003416-463-40) Following Engler's study, contemporary scholars have abandoned the distinction \"religious\" vs. \"empirico-rational\" as no longer being a useful analytical distinction. The text may have Buddhist influences, since a redactor named [Nagarjuna](/wiki/Nagarjuna) has raised many historical questions, whether he was the same person of Mahayana Buddhism fame. [[27]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999347-350_(Volume_IA)-27) Zysk states that the ancient Buddhist medical texts are significantly different from both Sushruta and Caraka Samhita. For example, both Caraka and Sushruta recommend Dhupana (fumigation) in some cases, the use of cauterization with fire and alkali in a class of treatments, and the letting out of blood as the first step in treatment of wounds. Nowhere in the Buddhist Pali texts, states Zysk, are these types of medical procedures mentioned. [[41]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZysk2000100-41) Similarly, medicinal resins (Laksha) lists vary between Sushruta and the Pali texts, with some sets not mentioned at all. [[42]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZysk200081,_83-42) While Sushruta and Caraka are close, many afflictions and their treatments found in these texts are not found in Pali texts. [[43]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZysk200074-76,_115-116,_123-43) In general, states Zysk, Buddhist medical texts are closer to Sushruta than to Caraka, [[41]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZysk2000100-41) and in his study suggests that the Sushruta Samhita probably underwent a \"Hinduization process\" around the end of 1st millennium BCE and the early centuries of the common era after the [Hindu orthodox](/wiki/Hindu_philosophy) identity had formed. [[44]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEZysk20004-6,_25-26-44) Clifford states that the influence was probably mutual, with Buddhist medical practice in its ancient tradition prohibited outside of the Buddhist monastic order by a precedent set by Buddha, and Buddhist text praise Buddha instead of Hindu gods in their prelude. [[45]](#cite_note-45) The mutual influence between the medical traditions between the various Indian religions, the history of the layers of the Suruta-sahit remains unclear, a large and difficult research problem. [[27]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999347-350_(Volume_IA)-27) Sushruta is reverentially held in Hindu tradition to be a descendant of [Dhanvantari](/wiki/Dhanvantari), the mythical god of medicine, [[46]](#cite_note-46) or as one who received the knowledge from a discourse from Dhanvantari in Varanasi. [[21]](#cite_note-:0-21) Manuscripts and transmission[ oldest [palm-leaf manuscripts](/wiki/Palm-leaf_manuscript) of Sushruta Samhita has been discovered in Nepal. It is preserved at the [Kaiser Library](/wiki/Kaiser_Mahal), Nepal as manuscript KL-699, with its digital copy archived by Nepal-German Manuscript Preservation Project (NGMCP C 80/7). [[7]](#cite_note-Kengo1-7) The partially damaged manuscript consists of 152 folios, written on both sides, with 6 to 8 lines in transitional Gupta script. The manuscript has been verifiably dated to have been completed by the scribe on Sunday, April 13, 878 CE (Manadeva Samvat 301). [[7]](#cite_note-Kengo1-7) The first book to publish an edition and translation of part of this manuscript appeared in 2023. [[5]](#cite_note-Wujastyk_2023-5) Much of the scholarship on the Suruta-sahit is based on editions of the text that were published during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This includes the important edition by Vaidya Ydavaarman Trivikramtmaja crya that also includes the commentary of the scholar Dalhaa. [[47]](#cite_note-47) The printed editions are based on the small subset of surviving manuscripts that was available in the major publishing centers of Bombay, Calcutta and elsewhere when the editions were being prepared \u2014 sometimes as few as three or four manuscripts. But these do not adequately represent the large number of manuscript versions of the Suruta-sahit that have survived into the modern era. Taken together, all printed versions of the Surutasahit are based on no more than ten percent of the more than 230 manuscripts of the work that exist today. [[48]](#cite_note-48) These manuscripts exist in the libraries in India and abroad today. More than two hundred manuscripts of the work exist, and a [critical edition](/wiki/Textual_criticism) of the Suruta-sahit is yet to be prepared. [[49]](#cite_note-49) Contents[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=8)] Anatomy and empirical studies The different parts or members of the body as mentioned before including the skin, cannot be correctly described by one who is not well versed in anatomy. Hence, any one desirous of acquiring a thorough knowledge of anatomy should prepare a dead body and carefully, observe, by dissecting it, and examine its different parts. \u2014Sushruta Samhita, Book 3, Chapter V Translators: Loukas et al [[50]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELoukas2010646-650-50) The Sushruta Samhita is among the most important ancient medical treatises. [[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999203-389_(Volume_IA)-1) [[51]](#cite_note-:2-51) It is one of the foundational texts of the medical tradition in India, alongside the [Caraka-Sahit](/wiki/Charaka_Samhita), the Bhea-Sahit, and the medical [Charaka Samhita](/wiki/Charaka_Samhita), and except for some topics and their emphasis, both discuss many similar subjects such as General Principles, Pathology, Diagnosis, Anatomy, Sensorial Prognosis, Therapeutics, Pharmaceutics and Toxicology. [[52]](#cite_note-pmid4899819-52) [[53]](#cite_note-53) [[1]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999203-389_(Volume_IA)-1) The Sushruta and texts differ in one major aspect, with Sushruta Samhita providing the foundation of surgery, while Charaka Samhita being primarily a foundation of medicine. [[52]](#cite_note-pmid4899819-52) Chapters[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=10)] The Sushruta Samhita, in its extant form, is divided into 186 chapters and contains descriptions of 1,120 illnesses, 700 medicinal plants, 64 preparations from mineral sources and 57 preparations based on animal sources. [[54]](#cite_note-Dwivedi&Dwivedi07-54) The Suruta-Sahit is divided into two parts: the first five books (Skt. Sthanas) are considered to be the oldest part of the text, and the \"Later Section\" (Skt. Uttaratantra) that was added by the author Nagarjuna. [[55]](#cite_note-55) The content of these chapters is diverse, some topics are covered in multiple chapters in different books, and a summary according to the Bhishagratna's translation is as follows: the Ayurveda: eight divisions, history, definition of Purusha (patient), what is a disease, stages of ulcers, dosha-originated ulcers, therapeutics, sixty treatments of different ulcers|[[119]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1907265-477-120) [[120]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1907478-671-121) |5.

Uttara-tantra| |6.I-6.XIX||Eye disorders, injuries and infections: eye diseases, appendages, causes of eye diseases, symptoms, eyelid infections and their treatment, classification of eye lens problems and prognosis, need and protocols for eye surgery, eye injuries and Tipton, asserts that a physician should invest the effort to prevent diseases as much as curative remedial procedures. [[133]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETipton20081554-134) An important means for prevention, states Sushruta, is physical exercise and hygienic practices. [[133]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETipton20081554-134) The text adds that excessive strenuous exercise can be injurious and make one more susceptible to diseases, cautioning against such excess. [[16]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETipton20081553-1556-16) Regular moderate exercise, suggests Sushruta, improves resistance to disease and physical decay. [[133]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTETipton20081554-134) Sushruta has written Shlokas on the prevention of diseases. Human skeleton[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=12)] The Sushruta Samhita states, per Hoernle's translation, that \"the professors of Ayurveda speak of three hundred and sixty bones, but books on Shalya-Shastra (surgical science) know of only three hundred\". [[134]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle190770-135) The text then lists the total of 300 as follows: 120 in the extremities (e.g. hands, legs), 117 in the pelvic area, sides, back, abdomen and breast, and 63 in the neck and upwards. [[134]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle190770-135) The text then explains how these subtotals were empirically verified. [[135]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle190770-72-136) The discussion shows that the Indian tradition nurtured diversity of thought, with Sushruta school reaching its own conclusions and differing from the Atreya-Caraka tradition. [[135]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle190770-72-136) The osteological system of Sushruta, states Hoernle, follows the principle of [homology](/wiki/Homology_(biology)), where the body and organs are viewed as self-mirroring and corresponding across various axes of symmetry. [[136]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle190772-137) The differences in the count of bones in the two schools is partly because Charaka Samhita includes thirty two teeth sockets in its count, and their difference of opinions on how and when to count a cartilage as bone (both count cartilages as bones, unlike current medical practice). [[137]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEHoernle190773-74-138) [[138]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1907xxiv-xxv-139) Surgery[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=13)] Training future surgeons Students are to practice surgical techniques on gourds and dead animals. \u2014Sushruta Samhita, Book 1, Chapter IX Translator: Engler [[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEEngler2003416-463-40) The Sushruta Samhita is best known in non-specialist sources on medical history for its approach and discussions of surgery. [[52]](#cite_note-pmid4899819-52) It is amongst the first medical treatises in history to suggest that a student of surgery should learn about human body and its organs by systematically examining a dead body. [[139]](#cite_note-140) A student should practice, states the text, on objects resembling the diseased or body part. [[140]](#cite_note-141) Incision studies, for example, are recommended on filled with fluids and bladders of dead animals. [[141]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBhishagratna1907xxi-142) The ancient text, state Sushruta Samhita mentions various methods including sliding graft, rotation graft and pedicle graft. [[142]](#cite_note-143) Reconstruction of a nose (rhinoplasty) which has been cut off, using a flap of skin from the cheek is also described. [[143]](#cite_note-144) Labioplasty too has received attention in the samahita. [[144]](#cite_note-145) [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=14)] Atharvaveda and Charak Samhita, together describe more than 700 medicinal herbs. [[145]](#cite_note-tvpadma486-146) The description, states Padma, includes their taste, appearance and digestive effects to safety, efficacy, dosage and benefits. [[145]](#cite_note-tvpadma486-146) Rhinoplasty[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=15)] Rhinoplasty, surgery to repair the flesh of the nose, is performed to achieve two results: - To improve the breathing function of the nose - To improve the cosmetic appearance of the nose Sushruta's treatise provides the first written record of a cheek flap rhinoplasty, a technique still used today to reconstruct a nose. [[5]](#cite_note-Wujastyk_2023-5) The text mentions more than 15 methods to repair it. These include using a flap of skin from the cheek, which is akin to the most modern technique today. [[146]](#cite_note-147) [[147]](#cite_note-148) The nose in Indian society has remained a symbol of dignity and respect throughout antiquity. Rhinoplasty was an especially important development in India because of the long-standing tradition of [rhinotomy](/wiki/Rhinotomy) (amputation of the nose) as a form of punishment. Convicted criminals would often have their noses amputated to mark them as untrustworthy, but amputation was also frequently practiced on women accused of adultery - even if they were not proven guilty. Once branded in this fashion, an individual had to live with the stigma for the rest of his or her life. Reconstructive surgery, therefore, offered a hope of redemption and normalcy. Reception[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=16)] Transmission outside South Asia[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=17)] The text was [translated to Arabic](/wiki/Indian_influence_on_Islamic_science) as Kitab Shah Shun al-Hindi' in Arabic, also known as Kitab i-Susurud, in Baghdad during the early 8th century at the instructions of a member of the [Barmakid](/wiki/Barmakids) family of Baghdad. [[148]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999352_(Volume_IA)-149) [[14]](#cite_note-Rao-14) Yahya ibn Barmak facilitated a major effort at collecting and translating Sanskrit texts such Samhita. [[149]](#cite_note-150) The Arabic translation reached Europe by the end of the medieval period. [[150]](#cite_note-scuderi2016-151) [[151]](#cite_note-menick2017-152) There is disputed evidence that in [Renaissance Italy](/wiki/Renaissance_Italy), family of [Sicily](/wiki/Sicily) [[150]](#cite_note-scuderi2016-151) ( [Bologna](/wiki/Bologna)) were the Sushruta Samhita. [[152]](#cite_note-Lock607-153) [[153]](#cite_note-154) [[151]](#cite_note-menick2017-152) The text was known king Yaovarman I (fl. 889-900) of [Cambodia](/wiki/Cambodia). Suruta was also known as a medical authority in Tibetan literature. [[148]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMeulenbeld1999352_(Volume_IA)-149) Commentaries[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=18)] The earliest surviving commentary on the whole text, known as Nibandha-samgraha, was written by [Dalhana](/wiki/Dalhana) in ca. 1200 CE. Earlier commentaries existed but have only been transmitted to modern times in fragmentary form. These include lost or partially-lost commentaries by Jejjaa (ca. 700 CE), CE). [[156]](#cite_note-157) Commentaries continued to be written on the work into the nineteenth century, e.g., the Surutrthasandpan by Haranachandra written in 19th century AD. Modern reception[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=19)] A number of Sushruta's contributions have been discussed in modern literature. Some of these include Hritshoola (heart pain), circulation of vital body fluids (such as blood ( [rakta dhatu](/wiki/Rakta_dhatu)) and hypertension. [[54]](#cite_note-Dwivedi&Dwivedi07-54) Kearns & Nash (2008) state that the first mention of [leprosy](/wiki/Leprosy) is described in Sushruta Samhita. [[157]](#cite_note-k&n08-158) [[158]](#cite_note-cambridge-paleopathology-159) The text discusses kidney stones and its surgical removal. [[159]](#cite_note-Lock836-160) Editions and translations[ [edit](/w/index.php?title=Sushruta_Samhita&action=edit\u00a7ion=20)] The first printed edition of the text was prepared by [Madhusudan Gupta](/wiki/Madhusudan_Gupta) (2 vols, Calcutta 1835, [1836](//archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.406017/page/n251)). A partial English translation by U. C. Datta appeared in 1883. The first complete English translation of the Sushruta Samhita was by Kaviraj Kunjalal Bhishagratna, who published it in three volumes between 1907 and 1916 (reprinted 1963, 2006). [[160]](#cite_note-161) [[note 1]](#cite_note-selby1-61) An English translation of both the Sushruta Samhita and Dalhana's commentary was published in three volumes by P. V. Sharma in 1999.
