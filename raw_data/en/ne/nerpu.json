The value of your investment will fluctuate over time, and you may gain or lose money. You must be at least 18 years old to open an IRA with Fidelity. 1. For a traditional IRA, for 2023 full deductibility of a contribution is available to covered individuals whose 2023 Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is $116,000 or less (joint) and $73,000 or less (single); partial deductibility for MAGI up to $136,000 (joint) and $83,000 (single). In addition, full deductibility of a contribution is available for non-covered individuals whose spouse is covered by an employer sponsored plan for joint filers with a MAGI of $218,000 or less in 2023; and partial deductibility for MAGI up to $228,000. If neither you nor your spouse (if any) is a participant in a workplace plan, then your traditional IRA contribution is always tax deductible, regardless of your income. 2. The change in the RMDs age requirement from 72 to 73 applies only to individuals who turn 72 on or after January 1, 2023. After you reach age 73, the IRS generally requires you to withdraw an RMD annually from your tax-advantaged retirement accounts (excluding Roth IRAs, and Roth accounts in employer retirement plan accounts starting in 2024). Please speak with your tax advisor regarding the impact of this change on future RMDs. 3. Clients with $250,000 or more at Fidelity may be eligible for dedicated Fidelity advisor access. 4. No account fees or minimums to open Fidelity retail IRA accounts. Expenses charged by investments (e.g., funds, managed accounts, and certain HSAs), and commissions, interest charges, and other expenses for transactions, may still apply. See [Fidelity.com/commissions](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/commissions-margin-rates) for further details. Zero account minimums apply to retail brokerage accounts only. Account minimums may apply to certain account types (e.g., managed accounts) and/or the purchase of some Fidelity mutual funds that have a minimum investment requirement. See [Fidelity.com/commissions](https://www.fidelity.com/trading/commissions-margin-rates) and/or the fund's prospectus for details. 5.
