If you have a child that has a hard time focusing in school, try to get them in bed at a reasonable time. Check out my top [10 remedies for a better night's sleep](https://www.ouroilyhouse.com/10-remedies-for-a-better-night-sleep-essential-oils-for-sleep/). #2 Healthy Diet Eating a clean diet rich in healthy fats, organic proteins, and lots of fruit and veggies is key. Staying away from sugary foods and food dyes can definitely help the brain to function better. Check out [my tips to get your picky eaters to eat healthier. ](https://www.ouroilyhouse.com/10-tips-to-get-picky-kids-to-eat-healthy/) [Studies](https://www.additudemag.com/feed-your-childs-focus-adhd-diet-nutrition/) have shown that processed foods containing high amounts of sugar and food dyes can cause hyperactivity in children. #3 Supplements Fish oil and B vitamins can be very effective for focus and concentration. It is always best to consult a doctor before trying something new, but it is worth looking into if you struggle with concentrating. It could be as simple as a deficiency, and taking a supplement could really help. Being on a daily probiotic is also recommended for proper brain function. Hyperactivity, or ADHD, can be linked to leaky gut syndrome and digestive issues. Taking a probiotic can help with those symptoms. Here are the [probiotics I use](http://doterra.com/US/en/p/digestzen-pb-assist?OwnerID=1451451) and the ones [my kids use](http://doterra.com/US/en/p/pb-assist-jr?OwnerID=1451451). #Regular Exercise Fresh air and exercise can do a body (and brain) good! Try going on a walk before going into work or school. Exerting some energy before having to sit down and focus on specific tasks can do the trick. When the kids get home from school, let them run around and play outside before sitting them down for homework.
