Founded in 2002 by [Vivek Sahni](https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/wellness/kama-ayurveda-takes-holistic-wellness-message-britain-1235590197/), the opening marks the brand's first market expansion outside of India and will offer an experience for mind, body and soul. More from WWD In the multitier space, there's something for everyone: ground-floor shopping, Ayurvedic food and beverages curated by brand ambassador, cook and well-being expert Jasmine Hemsley on the mezzanine level, and a space for Ayurvedic treatments with practitioners in two treatment rooms on the lower ground floor. \"Kama Ayurveda is a 22-year-old brand with a rich history in India. We already know how important the in-store experience is through our 64 stores located across India, and by bringing this to the U.K., we are confident that the brand's customer base and loyal following will continue to grow,\" said Sahni. In that spirit, the brand is also set to launch at [Harrods](https://wwd.com/business-news/retail/harrods-labelhood-year-of-the-rabbit-pop-up-1235482300/) on Oct. 20. The partnership will act as an extension of Kama Ayurveda's stand-alone store experience, with an exclusive concession as well as introducing a service menu as part of the spa's treatment offering. \"The boutique on the fifth floor of Harrods is a beautiful ode to Kerala, the birthplace of Ayurveda, and allows our customers to be fully immersed in a 360-degree Ayurvedic experience, seamlessly blending services and products for our customers to discover,\" explained Imogen Porter, Harrods' [beauty](https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/how-will-the-return-of-student-loan-repayment-impact-gen-z-and-millennial-beauty-spend-1235783010/) buying manager. One of the oldest traditional systems of medicine in existence, [Ayurveda](https://wwd.com/beauty-industry-news/beauty-features/indian-inspired-ayurvedic-beauty-takeover-1235607417/) is derived from the Sanskrit terms \"ayer,\" meaning \"life,\" and \"veda,\" which means \"knowledge.\" Ayurveda emphasizes the interconnectedness of one's mental, physical and spiritual states and promotes balanced lifestyle choices and rituals as a means to living healthily and preventing and treating diseases. According to data from Verified Market Research, the global Ayurvedic market is projected to reach $21.12 billion by 2028, up from $6.5 billion in 2020.
