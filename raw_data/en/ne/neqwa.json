Or also have low motivation to apply these coping skills? Have any of your clients ever expressed frustration with the outcomes of psychiatric medication treatment? When I first began psychiatric practice over 14 years ago I remember feeling frustrated with the limited and minimal response I would see with most psychotropic medications. As I began to practice holistic and integrative medicine, I realized how vital the gut-brain connection is, and how any type of gut dysfunction can significantly alter physical and emotional well-being, mimicking many psychiatric syndromes including ADHD, fatigue, depression, anxiety and even mood swings. Recognizing and treating gut dysfunction along with nutritional deficiencies can have a drastic result in improving your clients' focus and concentration, energy levels, motivation and even depression, anxiety and mood stability. Today we will review how the gut and brain are intricately connected; some simple ways that you can help your clients improve their digestive health and nutritional deficiencies, powerfully impacting the results of your therapy practice. Dr. Katie Cole is a talented and caring Holistic Psychiatrist and Medical Intuitive, dedicated to enhancing the physical, emotional and spiritual well-being of all patients. She specializes in a root-cause approach using functional medicine to diagnose and treat psychiatric symptoms and syndromes. She is passionate about \"wholistic\" approaches to healing and utilizes many tools including nutrition, micronutrient supplementation, energy medicine, Reiki energy healing and transformational coaching. This talk will discuss the human microbiome, the gut-brain communication patterns and the impact of gut microbiome dysfunction on emotional and physical well-being. This talk will also provide some simple yet powerful recommendations to improve psychiatric symptoms by implementing specific nutrients vital for optimal well-being. [Katie Cole, DO](http://functionalmedicinesf.com/community/dr-katie-sofia-cole/) is an award-winning, innovative psychiatrist, who is a pioneer in the field of A New Psychiatry, integrating holistic psychiatry, functional and integrative medicine, along with medical intuition. She is radically shifting the current landscape of psychiatry. Dr. Cole is a holistic Psychiatrist who helps women heal and transform their physical, emotional and spiritual bodies simultaneously using a progressive \"root cause\", personalized medicine approach. Dr. Cole believes that many psychiatric syndromes are a direct result of underlying inflammation, and that the body can heal itself if given the proper environment in which to heal (nutrition, healthy gut microbiome, healthy digestion and following an anti-inflammatory diet and lifestyle). Dr. Cole blends functional medicine with medical intuition to evaluate and treat the underlying causes of inflammation or \"dis-ease\". She believes in first building a strong physical and emotional foundation. This may include laboratory testing, brain imaging, holistic nutrition, micronutrient repletion, herbal, hormonal and other approaches while minimizing use of traditional medications, to promote optimal health and well-being. Dr. Cole promotes deep, permanent body-mind-spirit healing, which lays the foundation for soul evolution and radical transformation. Her unique ability to connect the spiritual and physical realm allows her patients to discover and better understand their own internal map for healing, therefore promoting self-empowerment. Dr. Cole is board certified in Psychiatry, and has extensive training in Functional and Orthomolecular Medicine, Holistic Nutrition, Reiki Energy Healing, Women's Mental Health, Perinatal Psychiatry, Ayurvedic Medicine, Transformational Coaching, Spiritual Medicine and Medical Intuition.
