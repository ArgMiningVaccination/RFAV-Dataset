Malloy has asked two psychiatrists from Hartford Hospital's Institute of Living (IOL) to serve on the Sandy Hook Advisory Commission. Named to the expert panel were Harold I. Schwartz, M.D., psychiatrist-in-chief at the IOL and vice president, behavioral health at Hartford Hospital; and Adrienne Bentman, M.D., director of the Adult Psychiatry Residency Program at the IOL. Gov. Malloy asked the Commission to make specific public safety recommen - dations about school safety, mental health and gun violence prevention. He asked the group to \"begin the task of taking a broad, systemic approach in crafting the recommendations that will lead to comprehensive legislative and policy changes that must occur following the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School.\" 2withheld), who recently had the procedure. \"Before my hysterec- tomy, my pain and heavy bleeding were worsening. I had been seeing a doctor in my rural town for two years who refused to do a hyster - ectomy because of my age. By the time I finally saw Dr. Shaneyfelt, I was severely anemic.\" Benign uterine fibroid tumors can cause pelvic discomfort, pain or pressure on the bladder or other organs. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, one in ten women of reproductive age in the United States suffer from endometriosis, a disabling condition that causes pain and cramping when cells from the uterine lining spread to the ovaries, Fallopian tubes, blad - der and bowel. Although she was only 34, Kim had tried medications, but her fi - broids kept growing. \"I was aston - ished when Dr. Shaneyfelt showed me a picture of the multiple tumors that dwarfed my uterus,\" said Kim. \"She was open to new technology and I was happy to have my uterus removed with the least amount of scarring possible.\" \"Laparoscopic hysterectomy with transvaginal removal of the uterus is a safe approach for benign fibroids or endome - triosis,\" said Dr. Shaneyfelt. \"We close the incision with dissolvable stitches that can't even be seen six weeks later. One of my patients was concerned about keeping her navel ring, so we made an incision to minimize the scar so she could still wear her jewelry.\"The most common major gyne - cological surgical procedure in the United States, removal of the uterus, puts an end to pelvic pain or troublesome menstrual bleeding. Hysterectomy once required a long incision and left a scar across the entire abdomen. Laparoscopy brought advantages over tradition - al approaches to \"open\" abdominal surgery. Minimally invasive tech - niques transformed the surgical landscape with smaller scars, re - duced pain and less blood loss. But even minimally invasive surgery usually involves several incisions for the camera-tipped scope and instruments. Now a new surgical method allows the physician to make only a single incision, or port , just inside the belly button. Research shows that single-port laparoscopic sur - gery offers cosmetic advantages, shorter recovery times and fewer complications. \"We make an incision, a little more than an inch long, just below the navel,\" said obstetrician-gy - necologist Kristin Shaneyfelt, D.O. \"We insert the camera and instru - ments through a port that's shaped sort of like a Tupperware lid. We switch instruments through the same port, cutting and cauterizing (stanching the bleed - ing) with little blood loss and good visualization of the abdomen. Then we simply remove the uterus and cervix through the vagina.\" \"My scar isn't even a half-inch long and it's hidden in the folds around my belly button,\" said Kim (last name Dr. Kristin ShaneyfeltA hysterectomy through a single belly button incision I was surprised that I recovered so quickly,\" said Kim. \"I had very little pain after my hysterectomy. I went home after an overnight stay in the hospital and was back at work six weeks later.Beyond Advanced 3A lasting legacy Hartford Hospital performed its first kidney transplant in 1971 and has been at the forefront of transplant surgery ever since. Cardiologist James E. Dougherty, M.D., recalled one major milestone when he recounted the surgery performed by Dr. Henry Low. \"In the fall of 1984 Andy Buczek was the first heart transplant patient at Hartford Hospital and the first successful heart transplant in the state of Connecticut.\" Two hip operations, a colon resection and two children later, he remains alive and well. Another groundbreaking surgery occurred in 1996 when the late David Hull, M.D., performed the first laparoscopic living kidney donor surgery in New England. The statistics from the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) about Hartford Hospital's impact on transplant surgery are compel - ling: Hartford Hospital has been the third-busiest kidney transplant center in all of New England over the past 25 years; on a cumula - tive basis, Hartford Hospital has performed more liver transplants over the past 25 years than any other hospital in the state; Hartford Hospital performs the most heart transplants in the state; and in 2012, Hartford Hospital performed the second-highest number of adult heart transplants in New England after Tufts Medical Center in Massachusetts. The need for liver, kidney and heart donors Liver disease can permanently scar the liver and overwhelm its ability to heal. The normally resilient organ progressively loses its ability to make proteins, fight infection, digest food and store energy. When liver damage becomes irreversible, a transplant offers the only chance at life. Livers for transplantation may come from living or non-living donors. The American Liver Foundation stated there are over 16,000 Americans currently waiting for a liver transplant with approximately 6,000 transplants performed in the U.S. each year. According to the National Kidney Foundation, approximately 26 million Americans have chronic kidney disease. The number of aging individuals with end-stage kidney disease has risen sharp - ly over the past few decades. Right now, more than a thousand Connecticut residents are waiting for a kidney transplant. Like livers, kidneys can also be transplanted from living or deceased donors and at Hartford Hospital about half of all transplanted kid - neys come from living donors. Thanks to advances in surgery and anti-rejection drugs, someone with a transplanted kidney has a better survival rate than a patient on dialysis. Many end-stage heart failure patients suffer irreversible heart Our new Transplant Center opens its doors From its cozy waiting area to sun-filled exam rooms, the Transplant Center at Hartford Hospital provides a warm and welcoming environment. The bright and airy suite glows with the look of burnished wood all the way down to infection-resistant floors. The Transplant Center recently opened in a renovated space on the third floor of the 85 Seymour Street Medical Office Building. \"Our new center provides the infrastructure we need to deliver full Medicare-certified care. At the Transplant Center, all the physicians are under one roof. Patients don't need to go from doctor to doctor,\" said liver transplant surgeon Patricia A. Sheiner, M.D., director of transplantation at Hartford Hospital. \"Patients, referring physicians and the transplant team can communicate easily via advanced technology in our conference room. The complex nature of transplant surgery demands a collaborative approach,\" added Dr. Sheiner.Beyond Advanced Dr. Patricia A. Sheiner 4injury from coronary artery disease or a heart attack. By the time they reach Hartford Hospital, they are fighting for their lives. Hartford Hospital was the first Joint Commission-certified program in Connecticut to offer a full spec- trum of ventricular assist device (VAD) capabilities for critically ill patients, often as a bridge to transplantation. Another innovative technique that will soon be available at Hartford Hospital, called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), can keep a patient alive after sudden cardiac collapse. \"ECMO provides oxygen therapy until the patient's own heart recovers or the decision is made to add the patient to the transplant waiting list,\" said Robert C. Hagberg, M.D., chief of Cardiac Surgery at Hartford Hospital. In addition to the three major organs discussed here, donors can also donate other organs, tissue and eyes. All transplant candidates and donors go through an evaluation process that looks at a host of factors including body size and blood type. Dr. Sheiner and Dr. Hagberg agree that the limiting factor for transplantation is a shortage of donors. Dr. Sheiner added, \"After a transplant, we follow patients for the rest of their lives. But people die waiting for a new liver, kidney or heart.\" Dr. Robert C.

It's easy to register as an organ donor. Just go to BecomeADonor.org. It's the most valuable gift you'll ever give. 5Colby Salerno was born with a genetic disease that thickens the walls of the heart and eventually leads to heart failure. Diagnosed at age 12, he had a defibrillator implanted at age 14. He learned in 2010 that only a heart transplant would save him. His frail organ was failing when he arrived at Hartford Hospital on December 16, 2011. As the months passed, his physicians began to worry. The 24-year-old was confined to his hospital room and the adjacent halls. While he waited, he touched hearts with his blog, \"Tales from the 10th Floor.\" Because of the gener - osity of an organ donor, he got a new heart\u2014and a whole new life. \"I really hope you will have the ability to stare down from some sort of heaven and see what good you have done and those you have saved by being an organ donor.\" On May 28, 2012, nearly six months after he had entered the hospital, Colby learned that a donor heart was available. \"I was sad, I was happy, I was scared, I was elated,\" he said of the evening when the call finally came. Eight days later, he left the hospital with his new heart pounding in his chest. Colby, who plans to become a cardiologist, recently blogged, \"So I don't even know if anyone looks to see if I write anymore or if anyone would care, but decided to send out a tale, not from the 10th floor, but from my apart - ment in Pittsburgh where I am attending grad school at Duquesne. The last time I ran the mile without needing to stop I was roughly 10 years old, until today that is when I ran straight through for 13 minutes and completed the mile!\" This new, pounding, healthy heart...I don't think there's a single thing I can't do now. \u2014 Colby Salerno, heart transplant recipientAn organ donor saved my life! I'm doing great! I'm working on the units where I was once a patient. It's very interesting to experience being on both sides. I have been volunteering at various Donate Life booth events, volunteering in the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center as a Cancer Resource Volunteer through the American Cancer Society, and taking social work courses at the University of Connecticut. \u2014 Lauren Maston, heart transplant recipientBeyond Advanced Grueling treatment for bone cancer saved Lauren Maston's life as a teenager, but chemotherapy and radiation damaged her heart. At age 29, she began almost daily visits to Hartford Hospital's outpatient heart failure infusion center. Lauren spent nearly a year on the transplant list and two months at Hartford Hospital waiting for a donor organ, tethered to her hospital bed by monitor - ing equipment and lines pumping medications into her veins. Because Lauren was so petite, she knew her new heart would likely come from a pediatric donor. Early on a November morning, she finally got the long- awaited call that a heart had become available. \"Every day I think of my donor and the donor's family. I hope the family is doing well. I want them to know that I'm taking great care of their family member's heart and am forever grateful. Not a day goes by that I don't think about my donor and donor family and their selfless act to give me the gift of life during their tragic time. If we were to meet, I hope they would feel that I am living for the both of us and would be proud.\" \u2014 Lauren Maston\u2014Colby Salerno's letter to his future donor 6Physician accepts award Judith L. Pepe, M.D. Hartford Hospital celebrated its most suc- cessful Black & Red Gala ever on January 5, 2013. Many of the nearly 1,400 guests at the Bushnell Memorial were dancing in the aisles during an electrifying performance by the Grammy-award-winning band Earth, Wind & Fire. The 22nd annual gala, hosted by news an - chor Al Terzi and Hartford Hospital's Rebecca Stewart, was broadcast live on Channel 61 FoxCT. Organ transplant recipients and donor families , including heart transplant recipient and blogger Colby Salerno, shared their poignant stories. Proceeds totaling approximately $950,000 will be used to help refurbish and redesign an outpatient center for transplant patients.Black & Red Gala Top photo: On hand for Hartford Hospital's 2013 Black & Red Gala at The Bushnell on January 5th were (from left): Jeffrey Flaks, president and CEO of Hartford Hospital; Lori Flaks; Charlie Ortiz; Pedro Segarra, mayor of Hartford; and Elliot Joseph, president and CEO of Hartford HealthCare.The Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA), a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, recently awarded Hartford Hospital a silver Medal of Honor for Organ Donation. The only Connecticut hospital to win a medal this year, Hartford Hospital earned the award for its success in achieving and sustaining national goals for organ donation. Dr. Judith Pepe, a Hartford Hospital surgeon, accepted the medal on behalf of the hospital. She chairs the board of direc- tors of LifeChoice Donor Services, the federally designated non-profit organ pro - curement organization for six counties in Connecticut and three counties in Western Massachusetts.Most donor organs come from trauma victims who are declared brain dead despite the ICU team's aggressive ef - forts to treat their injuries. \"We do everything in our power to save them,\" said Dr. Pepe, senior associate director of Surgical Critical Care. \"The option for organ donation only comes at the end of life after heroic efforts have failed.\" When a severe brain injury leads to a fatal outcome de - spite the best efforts of the hospital's critical care team, the LifeChoice coordinator is called in to evaluate the patient's suitability as an organ donor. \"We let the family know in the most kind and caring way we can,\" said Dr. Pepe. As the hospital's donation physician champion, her role is to support organ and tissue donors and their fami - lies. \"We offer a flag-raising ceremony to all donor families if they're on site when we receive an organ, eye or tissue donation from a deceased patient,\" she said. \"At the scheduled time, the notice goes out all over the hospital and we convene at the flagpole. The safety officers have been vital to the success of this initiative to honor donors and their families and facilitate each flag-raising ceremony. We read a poem, My Final Gift, pastoral services recites a prayer, and we present the donor family with a framed photo commemorating the event.\" raises awareness of organ donation 7New Cardiac Frontiers Interventional cardiologists at Hartford Hospital make history We were the first in the United States to use a new percutaneous device to support the right ventricle. \u2014 Dr. Ronan MargeyHartford Hospital's cardiac surgeons were the first in the region to perform open-heart surgery on a beating heart and pioneered the use of robotics for coronary bypass surgery. Hartford Hospital performs more TAVRs (transcatheter aortic valve replacements) than any other hospital in Connecticut. Now the hospital's inter - ventional cardiologists have achieved another milestone\u2014percu - taneous placement of a right ventricular assist device (RVAD). Electrical impulses ripple across the heart, rhythmically squeezing the upper chambers (atria), triggering the filling of the lower chambers (ventricles) and circulating blood in a continuous cycle. Your heart beats an estimated 100,000 times and pumps about 2,000 gallons of blood through your body every day. When the heart is damaged or diseased, the heart muscle can't pump enough blood to the rest of the body. The heart tries to compensate, beating faster and becom - ing stiff or flabby. Fluid fills the lungs, causing shortness of breath. Symptoms of \"heart failure\" typically include fatigue, feelings of fullness or bloating in the stomach, heart palpitations and swelling of the feet, legs and ankles. When medications fail, physicians sometimes place a percutaneous (through the skin) ventricular assist device (VAD), a mechanical pump that pulls blood from the ven - tricles and forces it through the aorta to the arteries of the body. The catheter-delivered device can be upgraded to a surgical VAD if the patient's heart does not recover. Left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) are often placed as a temporary \"bridge\" to a heart transplant. \"VADs have traditionally been used on the left side to boost cardiac output and increase blood supply,\" said Ronan Margey, M.D., director of structural heart and adult congenital heart intervention at Hartford Hospital. \"We were the first in the United States to use a new percutane - ous device to support the right ventricle.\" During Hurricane Sandy, a 64-year-old man suffered right ventricular failure after a damaging heart attack. \"We received an emergency exemption from the FDA to place the right ventricular percutaneous VAD temporar - ily,\" said Dr. later, the patient had recov - ered fully and we removed the device.\" Last year, Hartford Hospital became the first hospital in the region to offer \"transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement\" (TAVR) for extreme-risk patients who aren't candidates for open-heart surgery. Now the nonsurgi - cal alternative for aortic valve replacement has been extended to high-risk cardiac patients. Recently, the FDA approved \"transapical\" delivery of the replacement aortic valve through a two-inch incision in the ribs, as well as through the femoral artery in the groin. A multispecialty team of surgeons, specialists from the cardiac catheterization lab and support staff per - formed the transapical procedure on the first three patients in December. The new method extends the minimally invasive procedure to many women whose femoral artery is too narrow to allow the device to be threaded up to the heart from the groin. \"Over time, TAVR will become the standard of care for patients at intermediate and high risk,\" said Dr. Margey. \"In some individuals, the structural 'plumbing' of the heart may not be perfect,\" he added. \"In the past, children born with heart defects didn't survive. Now, thanks to interventional cardiology and car - diac surgery, many are living into adulthood. New techniques are continually being developed. We have many new ways to repair a heart.\" Dr. Ronan Margey 8Treatment teams tackle the head and neck cancer threat Head and neck cancers\u2014traditionally linked to ciga - rette smoking, alcohol consumption and use of chew - ing tobacco\u2014are increasingly caused by a common viral infection. The human papilloma virus (HPV) is now be - lieved to cause between 70 and 80 percent of oro-pharynx (tonsil and base of tongue) cancers. Many individuals con - tracted the infection decades ago. Vaccines are currently recommended for teens to prevent this infection, which has also been associated with cervical cancer in women. More than 54,000 Americans will be diagnosed with head and neck cancer this year. The good news is that new treatment options are saving lives. Although the incidence of head and neck cancers has grown, the death rate has steadily dropped. For reasons that aren't well understood, HPV-linked cancers tend to have better outcomes. \"We create a multidisciplinary treatment plan for head and neck cancer patients,\" said Clinton (Casey) Kuwada, M.D., a Hartford Hospital board-certified otolaryngologist/ head and neck surgeon. \"Physicians and specialists on the head and neck cancer team from the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center collaborate on each individual case.\" \"Surgery is the treatment of choice for early cancers of the oral cavity (lip, tongue and floor of the mouth),\" said surgeon Robert J. Piorkowski, M.D., chief of the Division of Surgical Oncology at Hartford Healthcare Medical Group. Radiation is often used after surgery for advanced cases that may have spread to lymph nodes in the neck. \"The collaborative approach depends on where the tu - mor occurs,\" said Dr. Kuwada, who is fellowship-trained in both head and neck surgical oncology and microvascu - lar reconstructive surgery. \"In some cases, chemotherapy and/or radiation may be the best choice.\" Early detection is vital. Cancer clues include a lump in the neck, a mouth sore that does not heal, a sore throat that does not go away, difficult or painful swallowing or a persistently hoarse voice. Nasal or sinus tumors can cause a constant stuffy nose or pain or swelling in the face, eyes or ears. Head and neck cancers can be both cosmetically disfiguring and functionally debilitating. \"Patients may be left with significant functional deficits, such as impaired ability to speak and swallow, following surgical treat - ment,\" said Dr. Kuwada. \"We can take skin, muscle or bone from several donor sites with an accompanying artery and vein to create a vascularized tissue graft,\" he said. \"We then reconstruct defects in the throat, oral cavity (including tongue) and/or mandible (jaw) with these vascularized 'free flaps' to help maintain function and appearance.\"While tumors on the tongue are especially common, cancer can strike anywhere from the paranasal sinuses to the salivary glands to the vocal cords. Cancers of the oropharynx have frequently spread to the lymph nodes by the time symptoms appear. \"We bring together a multidisciplinary team of head and neck surgeons, radiation oncologists, medical on - cologists, radiologists, pathologists, and dentists,\" said Andrew Salner, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center, \"along with dietitians, speech pathologists, nurses and gastrointestinal special - ists who will insert a feeding tube if patients can't eat adequately during treatment.\" Some head and neck cancers are treated with radia - tion alone (vocal cord cancer) or in combination with che - motherapy. \"We combine advanced intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) techniques to shield sensitive structures with highly accurate PET (positron emission tomography) scans to optimize the target,\" said Dr. Salner. \"While such treatment frequently has a success - ful long-term outcome, it requires a highly coordinated team approach to facilitate optimal therapy and all of the supports patients and families need. When caught early, head and neck cancers are highly curable.\" For more information, visit www.harthosp.org/cancer/HeadNeck.

CESI is a state-of-the-art clinical education and simulation center where physicians, nurses, first responders and visiting clinicians hone their skills by practicing on high-tech replicas of the human body. Medical students try out innovative technology, perform sophisticated surgical procedures and sharpen their skills in a safe, simu - lated environment. Patient simulators are fully re - sponsive life-like models that teach clinicians how to handle life-and-death situations. Last year, officers from Groton's Naval Undersea Medical Institute practiced their emergency skills in a simulated combat zone, in - cluding a scenario in which a limb was severed by an improvised explosive device. Hartford Hospital President and CEO Jeffrey Flaks recently joined Stephen Donahue, director of CESI, and Godfrey Pearlson, M.D., director of neuropsychiatry research at the Institute of Living, for a panel discus - sion at the second annual Connecticut- Israeli Technology Summit. \"It was exciting to see the tremen - dous opportunity for Connecticut to expand business growth with Israeli companies,\" said Mr. Donahue. \"The commitment the Hartford Hospital leadership team has made to CESI has positioned us to be a key player for this potential partnership.\" CESI is currently collaborating with skilled nursing facilities to build a cur - riculum to help nurses recognize and treat early complications\u2014and avoid hospital care. CESI will soon host ZOLL Medical Corporation, a leader in medi - cal products and software solutions used for emergency resuscitation.

Hoarders often feel a sense of emotional attachment toward their possessions and become upset about making decisions to discard things. Often they hoard things they don't want or need. \"Family members and friends often don't understand,\" said David F. Tolin, Ph.D., director of the Anxiety Disorders Center and the Center for Cognitive Behavioral Therapy at The Institute of Living. \"They ask, 'Why don't you just clean up?\" Hoarding disorder now has its own category in the up - coming edition of the American Psychiatric Association's \"bible\" of diagnostic criteria , the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V), scheduled for publica - tion in May. Hoarding was previously considered to be a type of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). \"Hoarding disorder bears very little resemblance to OCD,\" said Dr. Tolin. \"What we see happening in the brain is very different. People with hoarding disorder have cognitive impairments that cause problems with decision- making and attachment to possessions. They say, 'I don't Researchers estimate that two million Americans are hoarders, but the actual number may be much higher. Hoarding is more than a secret shame\u2014it's a psychiatric disorder. have a clutter problem. Who are you to tell me I don't need these things?' Many are resistant to treatment because they don't realize the severity of their patho - logical need to save things.\" Thanks to a sophisticated brain imag - ing technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), Dr. Tolin and a team of researchers at the Institute of Living (IOL) are exploring the neural (brain) mechanisms of the disorder. With noninvasive tools like fMRI, scientists not only visualize the brain, but also measure activity in the cerebral cortex, the site of many cognitive functions. In people with hoarding disorder, the brain shows abnormal activity in regions called the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. During the fMRI test, participants were asked whether to keep or discard various items. Brain regions in those with hoarding disorder lit up when they were asked to decide about throwing away their possessions. \"Brain scans of hoarders making decisions about discarding things show activity in the part of the brain that acti - vates when someone is making a mistake,\" said Dr. Tolin. \"Their brains are telling them not to throw things away. It's usually not a pleasure response\u2014they're not getting a thrill like a compulsive shopper.\" Hoarding seems to be related to impulse control disorders, depression, social anxiety, bipolar disorder or certain personality traits, although it sometimes fol - lows a stroke or dementia. People with the disorder are chronically disorganized. Their houses are so cluttered that they can't sleep in the bed or cook on the stove. The living space is filled with unwashed dishes and tattered newspapers. \"Hoarders are prisoners in their own homes,\" eplained Dr. Tolin. \"Although we don't have a 'cure' for hoard - ing, we help people manage the disorder with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a form of counseling that goes beyond talking. The therapist and a professional orga - nizer visit the home to help the person regain control and learn how to make decisions about what to throw away.\" For more information, visit www.harthosp.org/InstituteOf LivingAnxietyDisordersCenter/CompulsiveHoarding.Hoarding is now recognized as a Disorder 13Nurse Navigators lead the way Your guides to the world of cancer care at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center Experienced nurses help patients navigate the difficult passages of cancer care. A nurse navigator can offer lifesaving advice to those who are suddenly confronted by a new cancer diagnosis or daunting treat - ment choices. \"My nurse navigator, Marlene, was very concerned about me and gave me helpful hints for managing the side effects of chemotherapy,\" said a patient we'll call Collette, who was recently diagnosed with a gastroin - testinal stromal tumor (GIST). \"She came to see me in the hospital. It's a great idea to have someone as a resource who can offer not only re - assurance, but also practical help.\" \"Karen Cudworth leads a team of five cancer nurse navigators,\" said Andrew Salner, M.D., director of Hartford Hospital's Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center. \"Hartford Hospital is one of only 21 hospitals nationwide to be named a National Cancer Institute Community Cancer Center, which will help to as - sist, educate and better treat the needs of patients, includ - ing those from underserved populations.\" The Cancer Center recently added an American Cancer Society patient navigator who helps newly diagnosed pa - tients with rides, information and other resources, as well as navigation for those with abnormal screening tests who need access to specialists for diagnosis. \"Our nurse navigators are your guides,\" said Dr. Salner. \"They can answer your pressing questions right away, help coordinate your care, refer you to the appropriate cancer Nurse navigators at the Helen & Harry Gray Cancer Center include, from left, Barbara Gaughan, R.N. (Thoracic Connect nurse); (Gynecologic & Genitourinary); Deb Walker, APRN (Survivorship Program) and Mary Ann Vanderjagt (American Cancer Society Patient Navigator). support staff and resources and even book timely appointments with your specialists. After treat - ment, our Patient Survivorship navigation programs ease the transition from active cancer care to lifelong wellness.\" Nurse navigators have trans - formed cancer care for many patients. In 1990, Harold Freeman, M.D., pioneered the concept of nurse navigation in New York's Harlem Hospital to help local residents navigate the complex world of medicine and health care, according to oncologist Mohanakrishnan Menon, M.D. \"Here at Hartford Hospital, the care of cancer patients involves doctors from multiple specialties,\" added Dr. Menon. \"Nurse navigators play an important role in coordi - nating this care. They enable communication between the patients and their care providers and facilitate transfer of information between the providers as well.\" For more information, call 860.545.6000 or visit www.harthosp. org/cancer.

What explained their longevity? Could it be a lifetime of climbing mountains and a diet rich in yogurt and fresh fruit? Research from the Harvard School of Public Health suggests that yogurt prevents age-related weight gain. Low- fat yogurt is packed with vital amino acids and bone-building calcium. Try eating it after a tough workout for an energy boost. Yogurt is loaded with protein, potassium and \"active cul - tures\" of beneficial bacteria. The Harvard study showed that eat - ing yogurt and other minimally pro - cessed foods staves off hunger. A daily diet rich in yogurt and nuts keeps you feeling full longer and may help reduce snacking that can pile on the pounds. A \"bombe\" is simply a French name for a ball made from two (or more) flavors of healthy, low-fat yogurt. "}
