The digestive system is the origin of most disease, and by cleansing and then balancing your microbiome, you create a healthier overall functioning of the body and mind. Cleanses that focus on juices and raw foods, from an Ayurvedic perspective, can stress the nervous system, dampen your agni (digestive fire), and aggravate your vata (air element). Therefore, we focus on nourishing all three doshas, balancing, removing impurities, and stoking your agni with easily digested, vegetarian cooked meals. Benefits of any of our detox options can include: - Improved immunity - Detoxification - Decreased stress - Glowing skin - Restored digestive fire - Lightness in the body - Clearer mind Learn more with our [FAQ's](https://kosaspa.com/offerings/cleanse-faqs-contraindications).

Join us to reset, rejuvenate, and plant seeds of intention for a healthier mind and body [Register for the Panchakarma is the Ayurveda time honored ritual of detoxification and nourishing our mind, body, and spirit. Specifically, it is the action of bringing balance back to the doshas, removing ama (toxins), correcting digestion, ensuring proper elimination, and restoring the proper flow of prana (energy) throughout. It is recommended to use Panchakarma as a way to prepare and move through the transition at the equinox of the spring and fall season. Performed in three phases, there is a preparatory phase, a detoxification phase, and a rejuvenation phase. - Purvakarma (5 days minimum): Prepare your digestion through diet, herbs, and self care to soften toxins, bind and prepare for release of excess doshas and toxins. - Pradhanakarma (3-4 days): Physical actions of elimination of the excess doshas and toxins. We will focus on the first three. - Virechana - rapid release of the bowels with herbs and oils. - Nasya - cleansing the sinuses and mind with herbal oils to the nose. - Basti - cleansing and nourishing the colon with herbal oils and teas through the rectum. - Raktamoksha - purification of the blood through use of leeches. This is still practice in India, but not in the U.S. Herbs are used to purify the blood. - Vamana - therapeutic vomiting to reduce the stagnation and wetness in the chest and stomach. This is still practiced in India, but not in the U.S. Herbs and practices are still used to remove. - Pashtakarma (10-14 days): Now that the purification and removal of excess doshas and toxins is complete, it is important to rejuvenate and and rebuild with intention.
