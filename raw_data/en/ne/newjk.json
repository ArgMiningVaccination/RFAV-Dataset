They combine Reiki & Qi Gong, Chi Meridian Acupressure, Guided Meditations, Aromatherapy, Navajo Flute Music and Prayer. I've developed each one as a unique healing treatment. It's a complete self-healing, balancing and relaxing experience for you, that will happen in the privacy of your own \"sanctuary\" at home. As you design a personal sanctuary for yourself....whether it be an entire room, a corner, or even hidden away in a drawer to spread out on your floor or a table, you will feel a connection with The Universe, and be able to see yourself as a Healer of Self. Using the four elements of nature: Fire, Water, Air, and Earth to create a personal space of prayer and movement, you will take the first steps on your new self-healing journey. Fire will be introduced with a candle. Water will be represented with a table-top fountain or a bowl of fresh water. Your favorite aromatherapy blend will be the Air element, and crystals, river rocks, sea shells, feathers, and herbal plants will become your Earth.You can bring in any meaningful objects: fabrics, photographs, antiques and jewelry. You can keep all of your treasured elements in a small box or a basket. Select anything that brings you joy and you feel with help with your energy flow.The Healing Ceremonies I've developed are for Women and honor a woman's energy, strength, faith and beliefs. As you blend prayer, your favorite things, sounds, aromas, and flavors to activate all of your senses, you will feel a deepening and quickening in your Soul. As you listen to Navajo flute music or music of your own choice, detailed instructions for performing Self-Reiki combined with Qi-Gong, as well as Chi Meridian Acupressure, will tap into your Spirit and transport you back to ancient times. As you view recipes for aromatherapy blends as well as soothing herbal medicinal teas, you will find yourself at a new level of relaxation, allowing you to feel the healing process taking part in your body. Each one of these Spiritual Ceremonies will renew your body's energy, rejuvenate your spirit and create a new balanced and peaceful YOU Remember.....do these Ceremonies often. Make it a practice.
