Study design - Systematic review/meta-analysis of 60 randomized clinical trials (opioid-treated pain; n=6404). - Interventions: meditation (5 studies), hypnosis (25 studies), relaxation (14 studies), guided imagery (7 studies), therapeutic suggestion (6 studies), and CBT (7 studies). - Funding: None disclosed. Key results - Overall, MBTs were associated with a reduction in: - pain (moderate association; Cohen's d, 0.51; Cohen's d, 0.26; P=.01). - Significant improvements in pain outcomes were noted for: - meditation (strong association; Cohen's d, 0.68; P=.008). - Improved opioid-related outcomes were reported with meditation (4 studies), CBT (4 studies), and hypnosis (12 studies).
