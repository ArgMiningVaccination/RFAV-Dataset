Integrative Medicine is the treatment and prevention of chronic illness through complementary therapies such as nutrition, exercise, stress management, supplements and herbal medicines. Specialist work with all members of the patient's healthcare team. Integrative Medicine consultations consist of an intensive review of your past medical history, current medical issues and desired outcomes. Our specialist can offer recommendations and assist you in choosing how to integrate complementary therapies and treatments into your life. What We Treat You may benefit from a consult if you want to take a more holistic or integrative approach to your health. Our specialists can offer complementary therapies for chronic illnesses or troubling symptoms such as fatigue, insomnia, nausea, pain, anxiety and stress. By addressing these key components of health and focusing on prevention, they can help you enjoy a better quality of life. Integrative consults are currently being offered at Medina Hospital with additional services added throughout the year. Integrative Medicine specialists will not replace your primary care provider or specialist. Our goal is to work together with all members of your healthcare team. Our expertise lies in managing chronic diseases rather than treating acute medical problems. For acute care and medical emergencies, you will need to seek help from your primary care physician.
