But, for the price of one or two services, you could invest in an acupressure mat, which could offer pain relief, relaxation and aid with sleep. Acupressure mats are made up of thousands of tiny spikes. As these are sharp but do not puncture the skin, you simply need to lie, sit or stand on the mat to apply pressure. This is meant to stimulate various points in the body to release tension. How do acupressure mats work? \"They are designed to work in a similar way to an acupressure treatment,\" Asha Chong, Five Element Acupuncturist, explains. \"When pressure is applied to certain acupressure points on the body - think the back, legs, hands or feet - blocked energy is released, tension is relieved and energy and blood flow freely. \"Unlike acupuncture, which involves inserting very fine needles into points, acupressure mats apply non-invasive pressure to the body. The acupressure stimulation addresses the total area compared to a targeted acupuncture treatment. \"The spikes trigger the points, releasing endorphins which alleviate pain, help the body and mind to relax or energise the body.\" What are the benefits? It might take a little time to get used to the acupressure mat. Most recommend starting out with a thin t-shirt and building up the amount of time you spend on the mat, eventually trying it on bare skin. While it might initially feel slightly painful or unusual, you should get acclimated to the feeling and start to notice the benefits. \"'When you lie on the acupressure mat, gentle pressure on the acupressure points on your back stimulate the release of endorphins, giving you a sense of calm, relaxation and wellness, with a boost of energy,\" Chantal Nogbou, from Dragonfly Acupuncture Leeds says. \"It's a perfect self care tool to help you slow down at the end of a busy day, or even during the day when you need to feel that sense of peace and calm.\" Shop the best mats below. White Lotus memory foam acupressure mat and pillow White Lotus claims its mat has been created by acupuncturists and is completely handmade in Europe without the use of glue or allergenic dyes. The acupressure mat itself is thick memory foam, while the cover is made from durable cotton. Rather than the round pillow most brands sell, White Lotus has developed a larger, curved pillow that helped to support both my head and neck and felt much more comfortable to lie on for longer periods of time. The mat has Velcro strips attached which means it can be rolled up for easy storage, without the use of a separate carry bag. The straps can also be used to wrap the mat around your arms or legs for targeted treatment on those areas. The only downside of the larger pillow is that it can't be rolled neatly inside the mat.
