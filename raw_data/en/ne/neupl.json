Alternative to Meds has been primarily invested in antidepressant alternatives for over 15 years. Using Holistic and Environmental Medicine, as our published evidence demonstrates, over 77% of people discontinuing antidepressant medication have a successful outcome. According to our study, by replacing these medications with a holistic lifestyle as well as other non-drug-based strategies, clients can feel better and do better long-term than when on medication. Watch the powerful story of Susan, who was truly incapacitated by both antidepressants and benzodiazepines. You will certainly understand that we are treating people who were wrecked by these drugs, considered hopeless by professionals, their family, and even themselves yet made a full and miraculous recovery using ATMC methods. 15 Years Experience by Professionals Who Understand Your Journey. We think natural Paxil alternatives are far superior because they are typically more sustainable and don't cause side effects. Many individuals experience unwanted drug side effects and believe that this drug does not adequately control the mental condition that they are trying to treat.9 For these reasons, they often look to find an effective mental health treatment plan that can side-step these problems, using non-drug-based Paxil alternatives.10 We believe that for many, alternatives exist which are better than continuing to be medicated on prescription antidepression drugs. Anxiety and depression are two of the most talked-about \"mental health\" issues in the world. According to the World Health Organization, hundreds of millions of people suffer from depression. Unfortunately, the rising use of antidepressants has not seen a decrease in these statistics.26 The good news is that certain natural alternatives for Paxil have been demonstrated to help not only with depression but also with anxiety.1 Natural Alternatives to Paxil Include: CBT13 Acupuncture11 Adequate exposure to sunlight* Proper lighting in work and home environment** Learned stress-reduction techniques27 Life coaching and other talk therapy28 Proper diet8 and targeted supplementation14 Cleaning the body and the environment of toxic elements15 Reducing exposure to toxicity,17 including toxic relationships16 * Medical studies have shown a marked influence of exposure to sunlight on mood, hormones, and other areas of health and mental health.3,12 **A study on the effects of different lighting at work showed a 13% improvement in well-being when proper lighting was used compared to the control group.5 Unfortunately, in mainstream medicine generally, there is still a tendency toward trying out \"this or that other drug,\" with little to no biological testing,18 crossing one's fingers and hoping that the side effects are tolerable. We are suggesting that a \"first do no harm\" approach may look like utilizing the best available known natural methods to treat and resolve depression prior to or at a minimum in conjunction with prescription drugs of any kind. Paxil \u2014 One of Many Mood-Altering SSRI Drugs Paxil, known also as paroxetine, belongs to a type of antidepressant medication known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)19 These are prescribed to treat different mental conditions, including depression (major depression, clinical depression), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or OCD, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and a whole host of other conditions, for which doctors prescribe antidepressants \"off-label.\"19 Doctors who are not well-versed in Paxil alternatives often resort to prescribing other medications such as other selective serotonin reuptake including Elavil (amitriptyline), and other various prescription medications, electroconvulsive treatments or even antipsychotics.20 Can You Fix Life with a Pill? The theory behind using drugs to manipulate brain chemicals to improve mental health has been under some scrutiny for some time now. In fact, many medical practitioners have begun to move away from the \"Chemical imbalance? Fix it with a pill!\" strategy that prescription drug advertising has been based on for decades, yet has never been substantiated in clinical research.14,21 While there is much research on the quality of natural chemical transmission (or lack thereof) along the CNS, the debate has arisen on using drugs vs non-drug-based therapies to improve neurochemical function.28 At Alternative to Meds, we specialize in methods and strategies that can improve mental health naturally. Paxil may be an effective and well-tolerated drug only temporarily in some people.9 However, as with all medications of this kind, unwanted, or even potentially harmful Paxil side effects can occur or the drug may not be an adequate treatment for the patient's symptoms. In fact, there are studies such as the one published in Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics that demonstrate that persons discontinuing antidepressant use after long-term use and using cognitive therapy do vastly better (46%) than those who continued antidepressant use.22 Luckily, there are many forms of Paxil alternative therapy that may be effective while avoiding unwanted side effects. Talk Therapy \u2014 Effective Alternative to Paxil Using talk therapy as an alternative treatment can prove useful for all kinds of distress, emotional disturbances, moods that won't lift, and other mental troubles. There are many forms of psychotherapy (talk therapy), such as CBT or other short-term therapies that can help individuals who suffer from depression or other mental conditions.13 Talk therapy can help a person to gain insight into their problems and learn how to resolve them in healthy ways through verbal exchange with the talk therapist. Talk therapists often combine talk sessions with homework assignments for the patient to work on between sessions. Paxil alternative therapy such as talk therapy with a behavioral therapist focuses on helping patients to achieve more satisfaction in life, work, relationships, etc., through their own daily actions and how to get out of the behavioral patterns which contribute to depression or result from depression.2 Drug-Based Paxil Alternatives \u2014 Caution Advised Big problems may arise for patients seeking methods of Paxil alternatives help if they simply substitute other prescription drugs such as the ones mentioned above. Other antidepressant drugs are likely to have many of the same problems and side effects as Paxil.9 If an individual is seeking antidepressant alternatives because of side effects or ineffectiveness, they may run into the exact same issues if another SSRI or similar drug is substituted. So, in situations where prescription medication doesn't work, other alternatives that should be considered are often ignored.14 This can exacerbate the initial problems as new problems may emerge due to declining physical factors. Risk-free Paxil alternative or complementary treatments in combination with therapy, such as acupuncture, and lifestyle changes may be all that is needed to treat depression for some individuals. There are effective natural treatments available for depression and anxiety.1,8,14 Holistic Paxil Alternatives However, everyone is different and the same alternative probably isn't going to be effective for everyone. Fortunately, many Paxil alternatives help anxiety and depression and many of them are simple things that can be included in everyday life. Some of the alternative medicines commonly used for depression as antidepressant alternatives include Valerian,29 vitamin B6,30 Omega-3 fatty acids,8 and 5-HTP (5-hydroxytryptophan).31 These substances can be found at most grocery stores and health food stores in the form of capsules or teas. These and other Paxil natural alternatives are free of side effects, and not addictive, and potentially significantly more effective treatments that can offer long-term relief. Individuals on antidepressants are usually given a prescription before there has been a comprehensive investigation into what factors are causing their depression.23 Uncovering the Causes of Depression If an individual suffers from depression, is it really because they have low levels of serotonin? This has been a great debate for over 5 decades, without any substantive evidence. 21 And, even if it were true, is that the only causal factor? What if they have a low thyroid?24 What if they accumulated environmental neurotoxins like toxic heavy metals that ruined their metabolism of energy?15 Internal swelling caused by food allergies slows metabolism and can also be contributing to the symptoms.24 The individual could have a diet so poor in nutrients that the body is unable to produce what is needed for healthy CNS and brain function.14 We must keep in mind that a poor diet not only insults our bodies but also our mental health. An individual may be drowning in a life that is unfulfilling, and they need a supportive atmosphere to make their desired changes. According to a massive review of available literature on the subject in 2015, a Swedish study showed that depression does respond positively to exercise, dietary changes, and counseling, and does so as well as or better than prescription drugs, without the risks associated with medications.2 Integrative Paxil Alternatives Methods Alternative to Meds Center is a place that searches for and finds the medical reasons that may be contributing to a person's depression. Our program involves the use of lab testing, stabilization of the neurochemistry through using natural substances, and cleansing to remove environmentally accumulated neurotoxins. We also use techniques for Paxil tapering and Paxil withdrawal, involving strategically targeted nutrition therapy, IV treatment, peer support, personal training, exercise, yoga, massage, and other holistic therapies. These are blended into every program in order to create effective Paxil alternatives for natural treatment plans.
