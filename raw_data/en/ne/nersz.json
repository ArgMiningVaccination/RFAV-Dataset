To make it simple, we've listed below our Top Ten Ayurvedic Herbs, which are great to have in your medicine cabinet and are used in many of our [potions](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/superherb-potions), as well as in our selection of standalone [herbs](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/superherbs). 1. Ashwagandha - VITALITY One of the best anti-aging herbs, [Ashwagandha](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/superherbs/products/ashwagandha) enhances vitality. This herb is crucial for people suffering from too much stress, or who are overworked. Take 1/2 teaspoon cooked in milk (sweeten with 1 tsp of raw honey). Note that Ayurvedic herbs are fat soluble, and are able to go deeper into the tissues and cells when taken with a healthy fat (such as ghee, butter, or raw whole milk). 2. Brahmi - BRAIN TONIC [Brahmi](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/superherbs/products/brahmi) is the #1 tonic for the brain and nervous system. Its leaves even look like the brain! Brahmi also balances the left and right hemispheres of the brain, and decalcifies the pineal gland. It is tridoshic, but is especially beneficial for balancing high Pitta conditions. Brahmi removes toxins and blockages from the nervous system. It helps with depression, enhances intelligence and improves memory and concentration. Brahmi enhances the overall cellular wisdom in the body. It also happens to be great for hair growth! Take Brahmi every morning to rejuvenate the body-mind. Ways to take it: boil in water (as a tea), boil it in milk, or make Brahmi ghee. It can also be used as a medicated oil for the hair, and the nutrients will seep into the brain cells via the crown chakra. 3. Moringa - THE TREE OF LIFE [Moringa](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/superherbs/products/moringa) is considered one of the most nutritious superherbs of Ayurveda and is often called the \"Tree of Life\".

Manjistha - SKIN PURGE [Manjistha](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/products/skin-purge-potion) is probably the best blood purifying herb in Ayurvedic medicine. It is anti-inflammatory and clears acne.

Neem - DETOX [Neem](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/superherbs/products/neem) is one of the most powerful blood purifiers and detoxifiers in Ayurvedic herbology.

It works wonders for eczema and psoriasis skin flare-ups. It is also useful for joint and muscle pain. Use neem on the skin in a medicated oil. 6. Shatavari - FEMALE VITALITY [Shatavari](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/superherbs/products/shatavari) is the #1 Ayurvedic rejuvenative for women (as Ashwagandha is for men). Shatavari even translates to \"she who possesses a thousand husbands!\" It nourishes and cleanses the blood and the female reproductive organs. Shatavari is readily available as a tea, in pill and powder form, or it can be taken in ghee or cooked in milk, which is the preferred form (all Ayurvedic herbs are best assimilated into the body's cells when taken with a fat). 7. Turmeric - THE SPICE OF LIFE [Turmeric](https://rasa-ayurveda.com/collections/spice-mixes) purifies the blood and the channels of the body. It improves the skin's complexion, bringing circulation and nutrition to the skin. Turmeric is anti-inflammatory and is a perfect remedy to treat acne-prone skin. Turmeric balances all the doshas, but it balances Pitta the most because of its blood-cleansing and liver-cleansing properties. Try to incorporate turmeric into your daily life in literally any way you can. Ideally use 1 tsp per day in some form: whether in capsule form, on the skin, or in the diet. Throw some in as you are saut\u00e9eing veggies in coconut oil to throw over quinoa. Boil some turmeric in goat milk with honey before bed. If you consume turmeric on a regular basis, you will notice your health improve in a multitude of areas. 8.
