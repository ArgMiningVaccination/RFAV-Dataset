A common and chronic health condition, [irritable bowel syndrome](http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/irritable-bowel-syndrome/basics/definition/con-20024578) is a gastrointestinal disorder that affects the large intestine, or the colon, and can cause the following symptoms: - Cramping - Abdominal pain - Bloating - Gas - Diarrhea - Constipation Symptoms range from mild to severe, and can be managed through a variety of natural methods, including diet modification, stress reduction and lifestyle changes, and traditional Chinese medicine herbs. Research on herbal medicine Authors of the Cochrane review searched for studies that evaluated the effectiveness of herbal medicine for IBS \u2014 including Chinese, Tibetan and Indian herbal medicines \u2014 and found 75 different trials. The trials, most of which were conducted in China, investigated a wide range of different preparations. \"Some of the medicines did improve the global symptoms of IBS,\" says lead author Jianping Liu, a professor from the Beijing University of Chinese Medicine. Medicines that showed promise included Chinese herbal formulations and individualized herbal formulations, as well as the Tibetan herbal formula Padma Lax. The Chinese herbal medicine Tongxie Yaofang showed a significant effect on global symptoms, as did an Indian Ayurvedic formula of two herbs. Several trials reported that combining conventional and herbal medicines produced greater benefit than using conventional therapies alone.
