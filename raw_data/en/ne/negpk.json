Spiritual healing is a safe and supportive energy therapy that aims to bring balance to a person's body energy fields as well as to stimulate the body's own natural healing ability. How can healing help you? Some people find that healing gives them a feeling of well-being as well as an ability to cope with stress or illnesses. Among other things it may help: - Relieve stress - Speed up with injury recovery - Promote calmness and relaxation - Increase energy - Promote confidence and self-esteem - Restore emotional balance - Deal with bereavement - Improve quality of sleep What can you expect during a session? We will first have a short discussion about the problems you may be experiencing and what you wish to gain from the session. After this initial chat, you will have a choice to either sitting or lying down on a couch. I will then simply invite you to relax and close your eyes while I carry out the healing treatment. I may work with my hands at a short distance from the body or I may place my hands on the body, with your permission. You may, if you wish, listen to gentle relaxing music during the treatment. At the end of the session, you will be given some time to talk about your experience if you wish to do so. Clients remain fully clothed (except coats and shoes) at all times. You will need to remove spectacles and hearing aids during the session if you have any. I adhere to the British Alliance of Healing Associations (BAHA [)](http://britishalliancehealingassociations.com/) code of conduct and all appointments are confidential. Spiritual healing and the NHS The National Institute for Health and Care (NICE) recognizes Spiritual Healing as a complementary therapy that may be used along side conventional medicine or any other forms of therapy. As such, doctors can refer patients for it if they wish to do so. You will not be asked to stop or change any medical treatment prescribed by a GP or consultant, and I always encourage you to seek medical with regards to any known pains or symptoms. I am a member of the [Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council (CNHC)](http://www.cnhc.org.uk/), an organisation approved by the [Professional Standards Authority (PSA)](https://www.professionalstandards.org.uk/) for Health and Social Care. Concessions I am aware that sometimes people who need help may not be able to afford a healing session. I offer a limited number of concessions every month. Please contact me for a chat if you wish to benefit from the concessionary rate. For additional info, "}
