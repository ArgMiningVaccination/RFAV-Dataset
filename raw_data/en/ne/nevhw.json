Overview The Department of Health Policy and Management is the home for health policy studies and research at the Milken Institute School of Public Health (SPH ). The Department focuses on virtually all facets of U.S. health policy related to both public health and health services and emphasizes preparing students to understand and analyze health policy matters in a broad, cross -cutting, and real -world context. Among schools of public health, the Milken Institute SPH Department of Health Policy and Management is unique, having been created to take maximum advantage of its location in Washington, DC, the nation's health policy -making epicenter. The MPH in Health Policy is for students who wish to develop in- depth policy analysis skills for use in va rious practice settings, including both federal and state levels of government, private -sector health policy consulting, and not -for-profit advocacy. This program is also available as a joint degree to GW law students (the JD/MPH and LLM/MPH programs) and to GW medical and physician assistant students ( the MD/MPH and PA/MPH programs ) who wish to enhance their clinical training with a thorough understanding of health policy. The Graduate Certificate in Health Policy is also available (please see section \"B\" below ), standing alone or as a supplement to a primary (e.g., MPH, JD, MD) degree. 2 Updated February 2020 Course Requirements All MPH students admitted to the Health Policy program enroll in MPH Core Courses ( 17 credits), Program -Specific Courses ( 20 credits) and Elective Co urses ( 8 credits). The MPH Core includes a practice experience in which students apply their didactic education by working for credit for an organization that engages in health policy research, analysis , or practice. Students may wish to give greater empha sis to either public health or health services policy as they develop their course of study with their advisor. See the Program -At-A-Glance section below for details about the required courses. Program -Specific Competencies Graduates of the MPH in Health Policy will be able to: 1.

Upon completion of the 120 -hour required practicum, students will receiv e credit for PUBH 6022. 5 Updated February 2020 Interprofessional Education (IPE) Experience Following (or simultaneous to) enrollment in PUBH 6021 Essentials in Public Health Practice & Leadership 1: Leading Self and Teams (1 -credit), students will be required to select an IP E experience from a host of options provided throughout your enrollment as a MPH student to participate in a one -time, case- based or activity -based learning experience. The IPE experience is a way to experience working with people from other professions/pr ograms outside of public health. Students will have many opportunities to register for this zero -credit (no fee) IPE 'class' (PUBH 6023 - Interprofessional Education Experience) and will receive credit upon successful completion. The Practicum (Applied P ractice Experience) The Pr acticum (also called Applied Practice Experience) is completed as part of Essentials in Public Health Practice & Leadership 2: Managing Organizations & Influencing Systems in PH . The practicum is a planned, supervised, and evaluated practice experience in health policy that aims to provide you with an opportunity to synthesize, integrate, and apply practical skills, knowledge, and training learned through courses, to gain experience in a professional public health work environment , and to work on public health practice projects that are of particular interest to you. During the practicum, the student works at least 120 hours in the field under the supervision of the site preceptor who has agreed to directly supervise the work of the student. Students are required to fulfill all requirements of the 120- hour practicum to receive credit for this PUBH 6022. If you have had prior work experience, you will find that the practicum provides the opportunity to hone your skills or to ga in ne w experience in a different area. However, i f you have three years or more of full -time health policy experience prior to beginning the MPH, you may be able to waive and replace the practicum through the Practicum Equivalent Experience petition. (Students who waive the practicum will still take the Essentials in Public Health Practice & Leadership 2 course but will not be required to complete a practicum as part of that course.) Decisions on the practicum site, the nature of the work, specific learning ob jectives, and activities of the practicum are determined following discussions and agreements among the student, the Health Policy practicum director, and the site preceptor, whose respective responsibilities are outlined in the Student Practicum Handbook. Your practicum can be performed in a concentrated fashion in one semester or can be carried out over two semesters. Most full -time students complete the practicum requirement during their second full year of study , but timing is variable . See https://publichealth.gwu.edu/academics/practicum for the Health Policy Practicum Syllabus, the Student Practicum Guidebook, and other resources. The following chart gives examples of potential practicum sites: SAMPLE PRACTICUM TOPICS AND SITES HEALTH POLICY TOPIC SITE Injury Prevention Association of State and Territorial Health Officials Insurance Coverage for Kids Children's Defense Fund Community Health Centers National Association of Community Health Centers Vaccine Policy Sanofi Pasteur Responding to National Mass Casualties US Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Policy and Strategic Planning Newborn Screening Programs March of Dimes Federal Health Initiatives Congressiona l Offices on Capitol Hill Mental Health of Kids in the Criminal System Department of Juvenile Services Medically Underserved in DC District of Columbia Primary Care Association Public Insurance Programs Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services 6 Updated February 2020 Health Policy Capstone (Culminating Experience) The Health Policy Capstone (PUB H 6350) is a 2-credit course that must be taken in the student's final semester of MPH study. PUBH 6320, Health Policy Research and Analysis Methods , is a non -negotiable pre -requi site to the Health Policy Capstone . Designed to bring together all the competencies learned throughout the MPH in Health Policy curriculum, this course serves as the capstone for MPH student s in Health Policy . In addition to weekly classes , this seminar re quires the production of a substantial health policy analysis or similar product, which can serve as a polished writing sample for the new graduate. The Capstone course is separate and distinct from the Practicum in Health Policy . Register for the Capstone using a paper Registration Transaction Form through the HPM Department (you can't register online) . Course Descriptions and Registration For descriptions of all public health courses, see http://bulletin.gwu.edu/courses/pubh/ . Additional information about courses and registration can be found here: http://publichealth.gwu.edu/academics/ . For course schedules from current and prior semesters, go t o https://my.gwu.edu/mod/pws/ (select main campus and then public health - log in required ). Flexible Programming (Online Courses) MPH -HP students may take up to 15 (of the 45 required) credits online, which ma y be completed prior to beginning residential coursework or at the same time as residential coursework. Note that online courses follow a quarterly academic calendar rather than semesters and that schedules for online courses may not be posted at the same time as the residential programs: https://publichealthonline.gwu.edu/academics/curriculum/academic -calendar/ . For more information about online courses, see the course schedule for the semester you're interested in here: https://my.gwu.edu/mod/pws/ (select online and then public health - log in required ) and general information here: https://publichealthonline.gwu.edu/academics/curriculum/ . Transfer Credit Policy: Up to 12 graduate credits that have not been applied to a previous graduate degree may be transferred to the Master of Public Health program . External credits must have been earned from an accredited institution in the last 3 years with a grade of 3.0 (B) or better. SPH Graduate Certificate students can transfer as many credits as meet program requirements, up to 18 credits, to the MPH. Gradua te Certificate students wishing to transfer to a degree program may apply to do so via the online change of concentration petition after completion of 3 or more courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. A grade of B or better is required for a course to be transfer red. Refer to the Milken Institute SPH Graduate Student Handbook for details on these and other requirements: https://publichealth.gwu.edu/content/services -students (click link for Graduate Student Handbook) . Required Academic Integrity and Human Subjects Research Training All MPH students, regardless of concentration, must successfully complete the Academic Integrity quiz in their first two weeks of study. All student s must also complete on-line CITI social -behavioral training module before registering for the practicum. Re fer to the Milken Institute SPH Graduate Student Handbook for details on these and other requirements: https://publichealth.gwu.edu/content/services -students (click link for Graduate Student Handbook) . Professional Enhancement Hours All undergraduate, certificate, masters, and doctoral degree students in the Milken Institute Sc hool of Public Health are required to attend eight hours of Professional Enhancement activities during their program. Professional Enhancement activities supplement the academic curriculum and help prepare students to participate actively in the profession al community. They enhance practical knowledge and awareness of public health issues - either in general or in a student's area of study. Students can fulfill this requirement by attending workshops, seminars, or other relevant professional meeting s, whi ch are frequently held at Milken Institute SPH and elsewhere in the metropolitan Washington, DC area. Examples of SPH -sponsored events include sponsored speakers, such as the Geiger -Gibson Distinguished Visitor Seminar and the Southby Lecture, and frequent brown bag lunches with presentations by faculty and visiting experts. Examples of conference sponsors include Academy Health, the National Academy for State Health Policy, the Pan American Health Organization, the American Public Health Association, and the American College of Healthcare Executives. Examples of organizations that regularly hold health policy events include Kaiser Family Foundation, Bipartisan Policy Center, Alliance for Health Reform, and the Brookings Institution. Opportunities for profes sional enhancement are regularly publicized via the Milken Institute SPH and Department of Health Policy & Management listservs and newsletters . Students must submit documentation of Professional Enhancement activities to the Office of Student Records. T he documentation consists of the Professional Enhancement Form found at http://publichealth.gwu.edu/academics/forms (which includes a prior approval signature from the student's advisor, a descrip tion of the program agenda, and proof of attendance ). Remember to submit your documentation before you apply to graduate! 7 Updated February 2020 Course Planning Tips NOTE: Always see your advisor for course scheduling and sequencing strategies, but remember that proper course selection, fulfilling requirements, and on- time graduation are the student's responsibilities. The Master of Public Health (MPH) in Health Policy curriculum consists of three types of course s: Required including Capstone Electives The MPH core courses are designed to provide students with a broad public health context as well as a foundation for subseque nt coursework. Early completion of these core courses ensures that students will have the base of knowledge to successfully complete the program specific courses and to get as much as possible out of them. PUBH 6021 (Essentials in Public Health Practice & Leadership 1: Leading Self and Teams in Pub lic Health) must be taken in the student's first semester. In rare cases where special circumstances apply, the Program Director may give permission for a stu dent to take it in their second semester. PUBH 6022 (Essentials in Public Health Practice & Lead ership 2: Managing Organizations & Influencing Systems in PH) should be taken during the semester in which the student intends to complete a practicum. Students should talk with their academic advisor and/or practicum director about any proposed practicum activity that falls outside of that semester. PUB H 6012 is the prerequisite for most of the program -specific required courses in health policy. Therefore, s tudents seeking to graduate in two years must take PUB H 6012 in one of the first two semesters of study. PUBH 6002 is the course prerequisite for PUBH 6310. For students seeki ng to graduate in two years, PUB H 6002 must be taken in one of t he first two semesters of study. PUB H 6310 and PUB H 6315 are the course prerequisites for 6320 ( Advanced Health Policy Research and Analysis Methods ). Students must take 6310 and 6315 before 6320. PUBH 6320 (Advanced Health Policy Research and Analysis Methods ) is the course prerequisite for PUB H 6350, the Health Policy Capstone . Students must take the 6320 before 6350 (the Capstone ), ideally the semester immediately before. PUB H 6350, the Health Policy Capstone , must be taken in the student's final MPH semester if the final semester is spring or summer. If the student's final semester is fall, he or she must take the capstone in the summer preceding the final semester . Registration for the Capstone requires Departmental approval via registration transaction form . Please check the c ourse schedule for a given semester to determine all applicable prerequisite s. 8 Updated February 2020 Timing and Accelerated Options We recommend that students allow at least five semesters to complete the MPH program. (This is typically two fall and spring semesters and one summer.) Students must complete the MPH program within five years. The program tec hnically can be done in a minimum of four semesters if started in a Spring or Summer semester, but students on this accelerated path must carefully plan their program and ensure they register as soon as registration opens to ensure that they get into the courses they need. Students may encounter schedule conflicts that prevent them from taking the courses they prefer and potentially delay graduation . It also is possible for students admitted to the residential MPH in Health Policy program to take online cou rses their first semester, which must include PUBH 6002 and PUBH 6012, and then complete the rest of the program on- campus in 12 months, which may be May to May or August to August (spending three semesters in residence in Washington, DC). Students wishing to pursue an accelerated option should talk with their assigned academic advisor and/or the program director to plan their progr am carefully before they begin. The MPH in Health Policy is designed to be accessible to working professionals with all core courses available in the late afternoon (3 pm or later) or evening in Fall or Spring semesters, in addition to the opportunity to take up to 15 credits online. Note tha t it is not possible for all courses to be made available after 6 pm so a student may need some flexibility in their work schedule if working full time while pursuing the MPH. Graduation Requirements Graduate Credit Requirement: Completion of 45 graduate credits. Course Requirements: Successful completion of all required courses (the MPH Core Courses, Program -Specific Courses, and Electives ). Grade Point Requirement: A 3.0 (B average) overall grade point average at the completion of the degree requirements . Successful completion of the Interprofessional Education (IPE) experience. Success ful completion of the required on- line CITI human subject s research training module. Successful completion of 8 Professional Enhancement hours. Time Limit Requirement: The degree must be completed within five years. Transfer Credit Policy: Up to 12 graduat e credits that have not been applied to a previous graduate degree may be transferred to the Master of Public Health program upon approval . External credits must have been earned from an accredited institution in the last 3 years with a grade of 3.0 (B) or better. SPH Graduate Certificate students can transfer as many credits as meet program requirements, up to 18 credits, to the MPH. Graduate Certificate students wishing to transfer to a degree program may apply to do so via the online change of concentrat ion petition after completion of 3 or more courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. A grade of B or better is required for a course to be transfer red. Online Course Policy: MPH -HP students may take up to 15 (of the 45 required) credits online , which may be completed prior to beginning residential coursework or at the same time as residential coursework. 9 Updated February 2020 Sample Schedules for the MPH in Health Policy Table 1 (full time students) and Table 2 (part time students) present sample course schedules that st udents admitted to the MPH program in Health Policy can use as a guideline to structure their program of studies. In all cases, 45 credits are required to complete the degree, including core courses (12 credits), program specific courses (2 4 credits), and Health Policy electives ( 9 credits).

The Graduate Certificate in Health Policy For those seeking a solid foundation in the substance of health policy and the skills of health policy analysis but who do not wish to undertake the full MPH, the Department offers an 18 -credit Graduate Certificate. Designed to provide both basic and advanced- level skills in policy research and analysis, the Graduate Certificate also includes elective course offerings to fit the s tudent's desires. If enrolled in the Graduate Certificate in Health Policy Program, the student will meet often with his/her advisor to craft a pe rsonalized course of study through the Elective Course offerings. Specifically, the Graduate Certificate in He alth Policy requires: PUB H 6002, Biostatistical Applications for Public Health (3 credits) (prerequisite: none) PUB H 6012, Fundamentals of Health Policy (2 credits) (prerequisite: none) PUB H 6310, Statistical Analysis in Health Policy (3 credits) (prerequ isite: PUB H 6002) PUB H 6315, Introduction to Health Policy Analysis (2 credits) (prerequisite: PUB H 6012 ) PUBH 63 20, Advanced Health Policy Research and Analysis Methods (3 credits) (prerequisite s: PUBH 63 10 and 6315) Elective Courses ( 5 credits) The Grad uate Certificate in Health Policy is available standing alone, as a supplement to an MPH degree from a different department (Epidemiology, Global Health, Environmental & Occupational Health, etc.), or as a supplement to another degree (e.g., the J.D .). Whe n pursued as a supplement to an MPH degree from another department, 6 cross -over credits from the MPH degree are available to count towards the 18 -credit Graduate Certificate. In other words, for students seeking both an MPH from another department and a Graduate Certificate in Health Policy at the same time, a total of 57 credits are required to complete both programs of study . Graduation Requirements Graduate Credit Requirement. 18 graduate credits are required. Course Requirements: Successful complet ion of all required courses . Grade Point Requirement: A 3.0 (B average) overall grade point average at the completion of the degree requirements . Successful completion of the required on -line CITI human s ubject research training module. Successful completi on of 8 Professional Enhancement hours. Grade Point Requirement. A 3.0 (B average) overall grade point average or better is required. Time Limit Requirement. The certificate must be completed within 2 years. Transfer Credit Policy. The Program Director/Ad visor may approve up to 4 graduate credits that have not been applied to a previous graduate degree to be transferred to the graduate certificate. The course(s) must be relevant to the graduate certificate. Credits must have been earned in the last 3 years with a grade point of 3.0 or better. Graduate Certificate students wishing to transfer to an SPH MPH program can transfer as many credits as meet program requirements, up to 18 credits. Graduate Certificate students wishing to transfer to a degree program may apply to do so via the online change of concentration petition after completion of 3 or more courses and a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or better. A grade of B or better is required for a course to be eligible for transfer. Online Course Policy: Graduate Certificate students may take selected courses for credit online, which may be completed prior to beginning residential coursework or at the same time as residential coursework.
