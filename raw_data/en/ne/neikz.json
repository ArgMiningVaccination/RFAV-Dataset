Is Toxicity The Reason You Feel Unwell? Ask yourself these questions: - Are you often tired or lethargic? - Do you regularly suffer from bloating, diarrhoea, constipation or other digestive disturbances? - Do you get recurrent headaches? - Do you regularly suffer from muscle aches and pains? - Does poor short-term memory and concentration affect your ability to function at work? - Do you have allergies or sensitivities? - Do you suffer from depression, anxiety and/or mood swings?

Even before you step outside the house in the morning, you are potentially being exposed to a myriad of toxins. Eating breakfast, washing the dishes, applying cosmetics and perfumes, and even having a glass of unfiltered water, can potentially increase your exposure to harmful compounds which may compromise your health and vitality. The good news is that your body has an amazing ability to eliminate these toxins through its inbuilt detoxification systems.
