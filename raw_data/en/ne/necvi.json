Frostburg State University is a constituent institution of the University System of Maryland. iiiii When it seems, as the poet William Butler Yeats wrote, that \"things fall apart\" and \"the center will not hold,\" it is through connections \u2014 relationships \u2014 that we bring a sense of order and purpose to our lives. To enter Frostburg State University as a student is to enter a community that values relationships. We want you to be fully engaged while you are here, connecting with ideas and people, both inside and outside the classroom. Our faculty are dedicated to helping you learn, but they expect you to be active learners, responsible for your own intellectual and personaldevelopment. Our small classes foster interpersonal relationships and the lively exchange of ideas among faculty and students. Our library and our laboratories permit you to access virtually limitless sources of information through modern technology and to engage inelectronic dialogue with others in remote sites who share your interests. Opportunities to build personal relationships abound in our student activities and athletic programs as well, whether it be participation in the student government association, one ofthe many campus special interest clubs, or intramural or intermural sports. Cultural events \u2014 drama productions, dance recitals, music concerts, performances by renowned guest artists, lectures \u2014 all provide occasions for the campus community and visitors from thesurrounding area to come together as an extended, connected community. And there are other ways in which we encourage our students to establish good relation- ships with the community around us. Frostburg State University values and promotes learn- ing through active community service. Our students devote thousands of hours each semes-ter to helping others through participation in activities like Big Brother and Big Sister pro- grams, AmeriCorps, service to senior citizens, fund raising for organizations like the Mary- land Food Bank and the American Heart Association, blood drives for the Red Cross, andcleanup and adopt-a-neighbor programs. Through service they learn to be responsible citi- zens and to use their talents and their knowledge to improve the communities of which they are a part. This catalog is a sort of road map to possible connections you can make as a student at Frostburg. It tells you about our academic programs, our faculty, and some of the activities available to you. With it comes an invitation to consider joining us as a campus communitythat truly cares about relationships, about connections. Sincerely, Catherine R. Gira, PresidentConnections Dr. Catherine R.

It is the only four-year institution of the University System of Maryland (USM) west of theBaltimore-Washington metropolitan area, thereby serving as the premier educational and culturalcenter for western Maryland. In addition to offering an excellent academic program, the Universitycontinues to be an integral component of regional economic development initiatives. It is also nation-ally recognized for its programs in community service and leadership, thus providing \"real-life\" expe-riences for students in virtually every discipline offered. As a result, FSU holds the distinction of beingone of the USM institutions most fully woven into the fabric of the surrounding region. Frostburg State University is distinguished by an excellent, diverse faculty, dedicated staff, and service to the communities of western Maryland. Students are afforded a supportive environment inwhich to expand their knowledge, understanding, communication skills, and appreciation for culturaldiversity. Couched within a liberal arts tradition, undergraduate programs promote intellectual growthand equip learners with problem-solving and decision-making abilities useful in developing globalunderstanding and effecting civic responsibility and constructive change. Graduate programs providespecialized instruction for students engaged in or preparing to enter particular professional fields. The primary program emphasis at the University is high-quality, affordable undergraduate educa- tion. FSU offers a comprehensive array of baccalaureate degrees with an emphasis on arts and humani-ties, business, applied technologies, education, natural and environmental sciences, human services,and social and behavioral sciences. Collaboration with other educational institutions enables the Uni-versity to offer programs in allied health, engineering, environmental research, and other fields respon-sive to State and area needs. Graduate studies also constitute a significant component of the educa-tional enterprise. In response to community and regional needs, high-quality master's programs areoffered in such professional fields as business, education, psychology, human performance, environ-mental sciences, applied technology, and recreation management. Through distance learning tech-nologies, the University provides expanded learning and research opportunities for students through-out the State. The faculty of FSU represent its greatest resource in providing excellent educational experiences for students. Teaching is the most important professional activity and responsibility of the faculty; re-search and scholarly activity, including collaborations with the Appalachian Laboratory of the Centerfor Environmental Sciences, and community and professional service also contribute to the vitality ofthe University and are encouraged and rewarded. The University draws its diverse student body from all counties of Maryland, nearby states, and a growing number of foreign countries. The majority of students come from the Baltimore and Washing-ton areas. In addition to offering affordable opportunities for undergraduate and graduate educationat its main campus in Frostburg, the University, through the University System of Maryland at Hager-stown, offers upper-division courses leading to the baccalaureate degree and selected graduate de-grees in education and business. Professional Development Schools established by the University serveas valuable resources for teachers throughout western Maryland and from neighboring states. Thestudent population of the University includes students from various ethnic and racial backgrounds(15% minorities), from both traditional and non-traditional age groups (16% over age 25), and fromrural, suburban, and metropolitan areas. In sum, the student body at FSU is broadly reflective ofcontemporary multicultural society. The University acknowledges its responsibility to enrich the educational opportunities for students throughout the State and to provide programs and services responsive to the cultural, communityservice, and economic development needs of the region. The Carnegie Classification of the University is Master's Comprehensive I.THE UNIVERSITY2 Institutional Capabilities Building on a foundation of excellence, Frostburg State University will continue to grow and to develop programs responsive to the diverse needs and interests of students. Recently approved pro-grams include special education, applied computer science, a Master of Arts in Teaching in secondary/K-12 education, community health (with Allegany College of Maryland and West Virginia University),therapeutic recreation (with Catonsville Community College), health system administration (withAllegany College of Maryland), and criminal justice (with Allegany College of Maryland, FrederickCommunity College and Hagerstown Community College), and Information Technology Manage-ment (with Allegany College of Maryland). New undergraduate initiatives currently under discussion include collaborative degrees or special- izations in biotechnology, computer engineering and ethnobotany. New graduate programs beingplanned include a collaborative doctorate in education and additional collaborative programs in theenvironmental sciences. To assist the State in addressing the critical shortage of teachers and information technology profes- sionals, the University will seek to expand the number of qualified undergraduate and graduate stu-dents recruited to and graduating in those disciplines. Expanded curricular offerings in education,computer science and engineering will be accompanied by increased efforts in retention in those fields. FSU acknowledges its responsibility to strengthen public schools through the preparation of certified teacher-education graduates and K-16 partnerships directed at improving curriculum and pedagogy.Increased opportunities for the continuing education of teachers will be accomplished through theexpansion of Professional Development Schools in the westernmost counties of the State. The University collaborates with government agencies, other educational institutions, and business and non-profit organizations to address the emerging needs of the broader community. The institution'shighly acclaimed programs in volunteerism and community service (AmeriCorps, America Reads,Vista, Voice, Learn and Serve) have brought the University national eminence. Special recognition andawards have been received from the Governor's Commission on Service and Volunteerism and thenational Corporation for Public Service. Approximately one-half of all undergraduate students in resi-dence on the main campus engage in community service to elderly shut-ins, institutionalized mentalpatients, illiterate youth and adults, participants in community recreation centers, and countless otherconstituents. The Performing Arts Center, opened in 1994, along with other campus facilities, has brought to the region outstanding national productions in opera, dance, theatre, and symphony and serves as thehome for a rich array of student productions. These programs and prominent lecturers speaking on awide range of topics draw audiences from the far reaches of Allegany and Garrett counties and adjacentcounties of neighboring states. Both private and University resources have combined to make theinstitution the premier cultural center of the region. The University recognizes its role as a major force for economic development in the region. FSU is a major employer in the area, providing a positive stimulus for the regional economy and opportunitiesfor advanced learning for the employees of area businesses and professions. Each year the Universityattracts thousands of visitors to the region through special events such as homecoming, parents' week-end, and commencements and through its vigorous summer programming, which brings additionalresources to the institution and to the area. Excellent campus facilities and the expertise of Universitypersonnel also enable FSU to serve as a center for applied research in the environmental and socialsciences, teaching and learning, and other disciplines responsive to societal needs. Increasingly, the University plays a role in attracting new businesses to the area. Various resources, including the Regional Internet Laboratory and the Small Business Development Center, are availableto stimulate business activity. The Center for Regional Progress conducts research and analyses for thelocal Chamber of Commerce and numerous other area agencies. Currently, the University is workingwith the Allegany County Department of Economic Development and the Maryland Department ofBusiness and Economic Development to establish a business park (Allegany Business Center) on cam-pus to attract science and technology companies to the area. Substantial financial support for the projecthas been received from the federal Economic Development Agency, the Appalachian Regional Com-mission, the State of Maryland and Allegany County. A major attraction for both the University and theprivate sector will be the excellent location and the availability of University resources, includingfaculty and student interns. . . . . .\"FSU has helped me todetermine in lifeand to appreciate theimportance of education.\" Mollie S.

The aggregate amount one may bor-row as an undergraduate cannot exceed$23,000. A graduate or professional student may borrow up to $8,500 per year. The maximumoutstanding debt for graduate or professionalstudents, which includes any outstandingFederal Subsidized Stafford Loan borrowedfor undergraduate study, is $65,500 (exclud-ing unsubsidized loans).

In addition, all Federal SubsidizedStafford Loan borrowers must complete anexit interview before graduation, withdrawalor leaving FSU, even though they may planto return at some time in the future. Repaying your student loan is an obliga- tion. Failure to repay your student loan(s) onthe required repayment schedule will resultin default. One of the many consequences ofbeing in default is that FSU has the right to,and will, withhold the processing of all aca-demic transcripts. Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans Same terms and conditions apply as Fed- eral Subsidized Stafford Loans, except thatthe borrower is responsible for interest thataccrues while he/she is in school.

Refund\\Repayment Policy See Title IV Refund Policy in the Fees sec- tion of this chapter. Law Governing Financial Aidand Withdrawal The Higher Education Act of 1998established new rules regarding howcolleges and universities determine theamount of financial aid that a student canretain if he/she withdraws. The new lawwas implemented at Frostburg StateUniversity in Fall 2000. The followinginformation describes how this law will beapplied using a specific formula that thegovernment has defined. Implications of Withdrawalfrom the University Effective Fall 2000, all students who with- draw or are dismissed from the university(including unofficial withdrawals) and at-tend less than 60% of the enrollment period(semester), will have their Title IV federalfinancial aid prorated based on the actualdays of attendance. Therefore, before a stu-dent considers withdrawal, he/she should meet with a financial aid counselor to deter-mine the financial impact on his/her federalfinancial aid. Title IV Federal aid includesPell Grant, Supplemental Educational Op-portunity Grant (SEOG), Perkins Loan,Stafford Loans (Subsidized and Unsub-sidized), and Parent Loan to UndergraduateStudents (PLUS). Under this policy, the Financial Aid Office will determine the percentage of Title IV aidearned based on the length of enrollment.Once determined, the student may be respon-sible for charges that were once covered byTitle IV aid. In some cases, a student mayhave to repay a portion or all of his/her re-fund as a result of withdrawing before 60%of the enrollment period elapses. After theunearned portion of financial aid has beenestablished, the funds will be returned to thefederal programs in the following order:Unsubsidized Stafford Loans, SubsidizedStafford Loans, Federal Perkins Loans, Fed-eral PLUS Loans, Federal Pell Grants, andFederal Supplemental Educational Oppor-tunity Grants. In cases where a student isreceiving institutional funds, he/she shouldcheck with the Financial Aid Office for poli-cies concerning these awards. Satisfactory ProgressStandards The United States Department of Educa- tion has mandated that colleges and univer-sities have in place satisfactory progress stan-dards that must be met in order for a studentto receive Title IV funds (Federal Pell Grants,Federal Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans,Federal PLUS Loans, Federal SupplementalEducation Opportunity Grants, FederalWork-Study, and Federal Perkins Loans). The standards listed below apply to the regularacademic year. In addition, the Financial AidOffice uses these standards to determine youreligibility for FSU grants, as well as Mary-land State Scholarship awards. Academic Progress Standards In addition to the minimum G.P.A. re- quirements described below, the FinancialAid Office will implement a new policy re-garding the completion rate of credits at-tempted (effective 5/26/01). The policystates, \"A student must have successfullycompleted of his/her cumulative at-tempted credits at FSU (including attemptedhours for summer session and Intersessionenrollments) in order to maintain financialaid eligibility for the ensuing academic year.\"Minimum G.P.A. requirements will also bedetermined by using the chart below. Exceptions All students must attain a minimum G.P.A. of 1.0. Students who fail to meet this stan-dard will lose their financial aid immedi- ately. Students with cumulative G.P.A.s of 1.0 but less than 2.0, will be allowed to enrollfor one semester on financial aid probationeven though they do not meet the minimumstandards listed in the table below. At theend of this probationary semester, studentsmust attain the minimum G.P.A. for theirtotal number of earned hours or they will beineligible to receive financial aid. Transfer credits will not affect the calcula- tion of the student's G.P.A., but will be con-sidered in determining the student's totalearned hours. For example, a transfer stu-dent who has completed 30 credits at Frost-burg State University and 20 credits else-where, must have a cumulative G.P.A. of 1.8 Total earned = all earned hours, graded and ungraded, including transfer credits. **Cumulative FSU G.P.A. = all letter grades (A,B,C,D,F,FX,WF) earned in all courses attempted atFrostburg State University, excluding authorizedgrade repeats and grade forgiveness. Enrollment atschools other than FSU cannot improve the G.P.A.because credits, not grades, transfer from theseinstitutions.

Finally, every student will have the oppor- tunity for interdisciplinary study by select-ing one of the FSU Colloquia to meet Gen-eral Education requirements. **Career Connections Frostburg State University is an active part- ner in the Career Connections initiative (alsoknown as School-to-Careers or School-to-Work). In the list on this page, the majorsoffered at FSU are keyed to ten career clus-ters chosen for emphasis by the State of Mary-land. Students whose regions or states use adifferent cluster framework can overlay thatrubric and find majors that match your in-terests and abilities. As part of Career Connections, Frostburg State faculty have participated in workshopson how to blend disciplinary and career in-struction, developed new curricula in part-nership with local schools and communitycolleges, and updated curricula to insurewhat you learn matches current industrystandards. In addition, teacher education stu-dents will learn how to blend career aware-ness into instruction at all levels. The ten Maryland career clusters are: 1. Consumer Service, Hospitality & Tourism 2. Business Management & Finance3. Manufacturing & Engineering Technology 4. Environmental, Agricultural & Natural Resources 5. Health & Biosciences 6. Arts, Media & Communication 7. Transportation Technologies8. Human Resource Services9. Construction & Development10.

Learning Communities Learning communities at FSU introduce first-year students to the concept of criticalthinking and offer the opportunity to engagein an in-depth exploration of a theme, a ca-reer, or a major. In addition, learning com-munities provide an environment which fos-ters the development of support networkswith faculty and other students, relationships that are important contributors to academicsuccess. Each learning community consistsof three or four classes linked by theme; allcommunities include \"Introduction toHigher Education.\" Learning communitystudents take their courses together as agroup during the fall semester, with no morethan 25 students enrolled in each class. Nor-mally, learning community students haveroom in their class schedules to take one ortwo additional courses outside their commu-nity. Enrollment in learning communities isan optional first-year experience offered ex-clusively during the fall semester. Enrollmentis limited to entering freshmen. The faculty who teach learning communi- ties work collaboratively to coordinate read-ings and assignments. They also arrangesupplemental learning activities that high-light the themes of the community. Since theinception of the learning communities pro-gram in the fall of 1997, a wide variety ofthemes have been explored. A partial list oftopics includes business communication,leadership, international issues, self-esteemand wellness, the world of public education,37THE ACADEMIC PROGRAM engineering, the medical professions, art and design, and the environment. New commu-nities are developed each year. Learning communities also offer entering students easier class registration and theopportunity to more closely interact with fac-ulty. A vast majority of learning communitycourses fulfill FSU's requirements in generaleducation. For further information contact Special Academic Services. Part-time Study Regularly scheduled classes are available to part-time students wishing to earn collegecredit or to improve their professional or vo-cational competence. Information regardingpart-time study may be obtained from theOffice of Admissions.

Summer School and Intersession The principal mission of Frostburg State University's Summer School and Intersessionis to provide FSU undergraduate and gradu-ate students opportunities to enroll in a vari-ety of high quality traditional classroom, in-ternship and distance education courses thatwill help to ensure or accelerate your degreecompletion.As part of this mission, the University pro- vides a wide variety of online classes andmore specialized courses during summerschool and intersession that are not as avail-able to nontraditional or part-time FSU stu-dents during the regular academic year. Inaddition, the University offers you opportu-nities to pursue unique educational experi-ences that are difficult to schedule while en-rolled in other classes. Intersession Each January, the University offers a com- pressed semester allowing students to pur-sue course work both online and in the class-room in the General Education program, intheir majors (either through regular coursesor via special-topics courses), or through par-ticipation in international studies courses.The semester is usually 18 to 20 days long,and requires intensive study due to its short-ened format. Enrollment in one three-credit course is rec- ommended, although you can register for twocourses and up to six credits. All courses of-fered carry the same level of credit as thatapplied during regular semesters. To regis-ter for Intersession, you may not be on aca-demic probation during the fall semester. Inaddition, athletes who are involved in com-petition during Intersession should seriouslydiscuss with their coach the feasibility of tak-ing courses.

If you aren't readyto declare your major, your ORIE instructorwill continue to advise you until you do, oryou may work with a faculty member whoenjoys working with exploratory students. If you enter FSU as a transfer student, and know what major you want to pursue, youwill be advised by the department chair or adesignated faculty member during transferorientation/initial registration. You then willbe assigned your regular faculty advisor. Ifyou aren't sure about your major, you willwork with the Director of Special AcademicServices, or with a faculty member trained toassist exploratory students, until you areready to declare your major. If all goes well, your major advisor will work with you throughout your academiccareer. But always remember that you canchange your major, or request a change ofadvisor, at any time. Talk to the chair of thedepartment that offers your major or visitthe Office of Student and Educational Ser-vices, Hitchins 116, if you want to make achange. Registration The Academic Calendar lists the registra- tion schedule for each semester and summersession. You may change your schedulewithin the period prescribed in the Calen-dar. You must satisfy your financial obliga-tions to the University to complete registra-tion. Class Standing Students achieve class standing accord- ing to the following table: Freshman 0-29 semester hours earned Sophomore 30-5 9 semester hours earned Junior 60-89 semester hours earned Senior 90+ semester hours earned Course Load The unit of course work is the semester hour, defined as the normal amount of workdone in one 50-minute class period and twohours of outside preparation a week for onesemester. The normal full-time load is 15-17.5 semes- ter hours of credit. The minimum load for afull-time student is 12 semester hours ofcredit; the maximum, 17.5 hours. If you carryfewer than 12 semester hours of credit youwill be classified as a part-time student.Academic Regulations & Procedures Student Academic Responsibility !You, the student, are responsible for planning your academic program and for meeting the requirements of the University and of departments. This responsibility includes developing a complete understanding of, and following all degree requirements, academic regulations, and procedures. !You must obtain, retain, and consult regularly the sections from the applicable catalog that govern your graduation requirements . The degree requirements specified in the catalog assigned to you at the time of admission or readmission serve as a two-way contract between you and theUniversity. The contract specifies that the basic requirements to earn a bachelor'sdegree, the General Education Program, and major and minor requirements will notbe changed as long as you complete a degree within seven years of the time of yourinitial enrollment in college. In turn, you are responsible for meeting these requirements. !The academic regulations and procedures described in this chapter may change during the period of your enrollment, and it is your responsibility to be aware of, and follow the academic regulations and procedures currently in effect. All changes in regulations and procedures will be published in official University publications such as the Undergraduate Catalog and Registration Guide, with prior notice of changes provided. !You are assigned an academic advisor, whose role is to assist you in planning the academic program and in interpreting degree requirements and academicregulations. It is your responsibility to confer regularly with your advisor. The advisor will provide the best, most current information possible, but, ultimately, it is your responsibility to request and use this advice wisely and to meetgraduation requirements and academic regulations. !After you declare a major, you are assigned an academic advisor in the department in which you desire to major. It is your responsibility to promptly declare or change your major so that an appropriate advisor can be assigned. Forms for the declaration of a major, change of major, and change of advisor are available in the Office of Student and Educational Services. Academic Advising Policies and Procedures At Frostburg, you always will have an academic advisor to assist you in realizingyour academic and career goals. You areencouraged to see your advisor regularly todiscuss your current academic work andfuture plans, to ask for advice about any prob-lem you encounter, and to find out aboutother services on campus that are availableto support your academic success. You willneed to see your advisor at least once persemester prior to registration to plan yourschedule for the next term. Your advisor willactivate your registration status in PAWS (theStudent Administration computer system) soyou can register and drop/add on the web.Most advisors post appointment sheets out- side their office doors prior to registration,or you can call or e-mail your advisor to makean appointment. Plan ahead to make youradvising experience successful. If you enter FSU as a first-time college stu- dent , you should plan to come to the Sum- mer Planning Conference, our freshman ori-entation program. At Summer Planning, youwill work with an experienced faculty advi-sor who enjoys, and is specially trained, towork with first time students. During yourfirst semester, your advisor will be the in-structor of your ORIE 101, Introduction toHigher Education, class. ORIE instructors/advisors include faculty and administratorswho volunteer to assist in your transition to41ACADEMIC REGULATIONS & PROCEDURES To enroll for more than 17.5 semester hours of credit, you must have earned an FSU cu-mulative G.P.A. of 3.0 or above, have com-pleted at least one semester of course workat FSU, and have the written permission ofyour advisor. Exceptions to these overloadguidelines shall be made only upon recom-mendation of the advisor and the approvalof the department chair (or Assistant Provostif the student has not declared a major).Forms for requesting an overload must besubmitted prior to registration. You will notbe able to register for an overload withoutpermission. Course Changes (Drop/add/withdrawal) You may change your registration (add or drop a course or change sections or credits)using PAWS (The Web-based student infor-mation system) from the time of registrationthrough the first week of classes (or theequivalent proportion of class days in a ses-sion that is shorter than a semester) if thecourse or section added has openings. If thecourse is closed, you must request an over-ride from the department chair involved. You may not add courses after the first week ofclasses (or equivalent). You are responsible for dropping/adding courses/sections at all times. Failure to doso will result in a grade of FX in the course orsection \"dropped\" and no credit in the courseor section \"added.\" However, if you miss thefirst class meeting without notifying the in-structor/department, the department chairat his/her discretion has the authority to dropyou from the course. All other drops must beinitiated by you. After the first week of classes, to drop a class, you must complete the change-of-course form and file it with the Registrar'sOffice. If you drop a course during the firsteight weeks (beginning with the first day ofclasses) of full semester courses or the firsthalf of a course less than a semester in length,you will receive a W. Exact dates governing withdrawal from a course without penaltyappear in the Academic Calendar. After thisperiod if you drop a course, the WF and W described below will apply. See the section\"Withdrawal from the University\" for a de-scription of the process for withdrawing fromall of your classes. WF \u2014 withdrew-failing \u2014 for official withdrawal from a course after the first eightweeks or first half of a course. (USED in com-putation of average.) W \u2014 withdrew \u2014 with approval of the Dean of the College offering the course, whowill grant approval only under exceptionalcircumstances (e.g. serious illness) docu-of the academic program, you are eligible re- gardless of your grade average. Attendance at Another Institution Once you enroll as a degree candidate at Frostburg State University, you must requestprior permission to pursue course work at another institution and transfer it into yourprogram at Frostburg State. This procedureis for your protection to ensure that coursework is transferable and is equivalent to therequirement you are trying to meet. If you have 0-89 total credits earned (in- cluding previous transfer credit, credits inwhich you currently are enrolled at FSU orelsewhere, and the requested credits off-cam-pus), you must follow these procedures: 1. Obtain a list of course offerings and cata- log descriptions for the course(s) youwant to take at another institution. 2. Complete the Authorization to Attend Another Institution Form in theRegistrar's Office. 3. Have course equivalencies determined by the Transfer Credit Officer in theAdmissions Office. 4. Return the form to the Registrar's Office for official signature. 5. Take the approval form to registration at the other institution. 6. After completion of the course work, have an official transcript forwardedfrom the other institution to FrostburgState University. In addition to the steps noted above, the following special rules apply: If you have 90 or more total credits (in- cluding previous transfer credits and creditsin which you currently are enrolled at FSUor elsewhere), you may transfer a maximumof seven additional credits of general educa-tion or general elective course work, pro-vided that you still earn a minimum of 30credits towards the degree at Frostburg StateUniversity. These credits may includecourses that count toward the major or mi-nor only if you will earn half of your majoror minor credits at Frostburg State Univer-sity. After you have a total of 90 or more cred-its:1. Your academic advisor (or department chair/coordinator) must give prior ap-proval for additional transferred creditsof general education or general electivecourse work. 2. Your department chair or coordinator must give prior approval for additionaltransferred course work that counts to-ward the major or minor.mented by the student, after consultation with the instructor of the course. The Deanwill notify the academic advisor if a W is approved. A W will not be considered after the last day of classes. (NOT used in compu-tation of average.) Class Attendance Faculty members individually set their policy on class attendance. You must under-stand clearly the attendance policy of each ofyour instructors and act accordingly. You areresponsible for explaining the reason for anyabsence to your instructor. If at all possible,contact the instructor prior to your absence. The Health Center does not issue verifica- tion notices for routine treatment. In cases ofsignificant or prolonged impairment, theCenter will provide appropriate written veri-fication of treatment at your request. If forced by an emergency to be absent from classes, you may notify the Office of the VicePresident for Student and Educational Ser-vices, which will keep such information onfile should instructors wish to confirm yourabsence. Absences for Religious Observances It is the policy of Frostburg State Univer- sity that the academic programs and servicesof the University shall be available to allqualified students who have been admittedto its programs, regardless of their religiousbeliefs. Students shall not be penalized be-cause of observance of their religious holi-days and shall be given an opportunity tomake up, within a reasonable time period,any academic assignment that is missed dueto individual participation in religious ob-servances. It is the responsibility of the stu-dent to notify his/her instructor of conflictsbetween religious observances and sched-uled course activities. Absences for Activities The faculty recognize the value of such activities as attendance at meetings of re-gional and national scholastic and profes-sional organizations, participation in Univer-sity-sponsored dramatic or musical events,and varsity athletics. If you participate in such activities and incur class absences because of them,you are responsible for notifying your instructorsin advance of such absences . An instructor who has any question regarding your absence forsuch activities may call the faculty memberor other person responsible for the activity. If you are on academic probation, you may not incur class absences for non-credit ac-tivities without prior permission of your in-structors. Since field trips connected with ac-tivities offered for academic credit are a partACADEMIC REGULATIONS & PROCEDURES42 Graduate Record Exam and Graduate Man- agement Admissions Test are given on cam-pus. The PRAXIS exam, which is requiredfor Maryland certification as well as for cer-tification in several other states, is also of-fered. Dates for these tests are publicized on cam- pus. Further information about these andother tests is available in Counseling andPsychological Services. Non-Graded Assessment Requirements Assessment is the evaluation of learning used to improve teaching and academic pro-grams. It is designed to identify patterns ofstrengths and weaknesses in student learn-ing so that changes can be made that willbenefit students. Some non-graded assess-ment activities may be voluntary, others maybe required for graduation. Credit by Examination In addition to earning credit at FSU or transferring course credit from other accred-ited institutions, you may acquire up to 30additional credits through examination. Ex-aminations accepted include: AdvancedPlacement Examinations, College Level Ex-amination Programs (CLEP), the Interna-tional Baccalaureate Programme and specialdepartmental examinations. Students whobelieve they may qualify for credit by exammust take the examination prior to signingup for the course. See the Policies section of this catalog for details on credit by exam pro-cedures. Transcripts of Records To obtain an official transcript, fill out the proper form from the Registrar's Office. Of-ficial transcripts will be forwarded to desig-nated parties or may be picked up in person. Withdrawal from the University To leave the University, you must with- draw officially by completing the followingprocedure. Failure to follow this proceduremay jeopardize the right to withdrawal with-out penalty and to any refunds (see Refunds Policy in the catalog section on Expenses). To withdraw from the University prior to the end of the drop/add period for the se-mester in which you are enrolled, you mustnotify the Registrar's Office in writing. Thatoffice will remove you from your classes andnotify the Business Office that you will notbe attending the current semester. You mustcontact the Business Office to arrange anyrefund that may be due to you. If you withdraw after the end of the drop/ add period for a semester in which you areYou cannot repeat a Basic University Re- quirement at another institution if you have received a grade of D, F, FX, CS, or WF in acourse that meets that requirement throughenrollment at Frostburg State University.Such course work must be repeated at FSU.An exception will be granted if you have notattended Frostburg State University for atleast five years and have earned an associateor bachelor's degree at another institutionduring your absence. If you have 70 credits transferred from two- year colleges, you cannot transfer additional credit from a two-year college. This is a Stateregulation and no exceptions are allowed. Exceptions to the rules specified above re- quire a written appeal to the Academic Stan-dards Subcommittee at least one month priorto the term in which you wish to study atanother institution. Auditors To be an auditor (one enrolled for non- credit instruction in a course), ordinarily youmust have earned a place on the Dean's List(at least a 3.40 average) the preceding semes-ter. You also may request to audit a class inwhich you previously have received credit ifa period of time has elapsed since you en-rolled in the course and you wish to refreshyour knowledge prior to enrolling in a se-quence course. Finally, if you are a non-de-gree student enrolling in a course for per-sonal enrichment you may enroll as anauditor. You are charged the same tuitionand fees for audit courses as for creditcourses. You may be an auditor only if youhave the consent of the instructor, ordinarilyyour advisor, and the Assistant Provost andif space is available. If the space is needed,registrants for credit may supplant auditors. As an auditor, you are expected to attend regularly but do not participate in class dis-cussion except upon request. You are notrequired to write papers or take quizzes, tests,or examinations. No credit or grade will beearned, but the audited course when com-pleted will carry the symbol AU (Audited). You are not eligible for credit by examina- tion to cover a course you have audited.Courses which have been audited may notbe taken for credit. To be admitted to class as an auditor, you must be officially registered. You may secureapproval to audit through the drop/addperiod. Testing The University provides testing programs designed to help students through their aca-demic careers. As a result of these measure-ments of aptitude and achievement, students with varied personal and educational back-grounds can evaluate their relative strengthsand weaknesses. Because other collegesthroughout the country administer thesesame tests, it is possible to compare FSU stu-dents with other college students objectively.The University makes use of this knowledgein planning the curriculum and in advisingstudents about their programs. Testing for First-year Students A. SAT: To enroll in the University, you are re- quired to submit the results from the CollegeBoard SAT. Take these tests at any conve-nient center on one of the dates assigned bythe College Entrance Examination Board. Getdetailed information at local high schools. Ifyou take the American College Tests, it isrecommended that you request a transcriptof the results be sent to the University. Indi-vidual departments may also requireachievement tests in their areas to be takenafter you have been accepted to the Univer-sity. B. Testing Policies of FSU: 1. All entering first-year students with fewer than 13 credits will be adminis-tered diagnostic placement tests in read-ing, writing and mathematics to deter-mine their strengths and weaknesses inthose areas. Transfer students with morethan 12 credits who have not transferredFreshman Composition and/or a college-level mathematics course will also berequired to take the appropriate diagnos-tic placement test(s). 2. If you earn below a predetermined stan- dard on these examinations, you will berequired to participate in specifiedcourses in your first semester to developyour skills to a level which is expected ofall entering students. You may not with-draw from these courses unless you arewithdrawing from the University. If youare unsuccessful, you must re-enroll inthe relevant course(s) in your second se-mester, and in each subsequent semesteruntil you receive a P or C grade in the course. If you receive an F or FX in the second semester (or any subsequent se-mester of required enrollment) you willbe academically dismissed from the Uni-versity. Senior Testing Some graduate schools and advanced pro- fessional programs may require aptitude orachievement test scores for admission. Mostof the commonly needed tests such as the43ACADEMIC REGULATIONS & PROCEDURES enrolled, your permanent academic record will always carry one of the following nota-tions, as well as the date on which withdrawalprocedures were completed. You will receivea W in each class if you withdraw within the first eight weeks of classes; W or WF depend- ing on the circumstances surrounding yourwithdrawal after eight weeks; or FX, unoffi- cial withdrawal. A W or WF will not be con- sidered after the last day of classes. To be eligible for the W after the first eight weeks of classes, you must provide writtendocumentation of extenuating circumstances(such as medical problems) to the Office ofthe Vice President for Student and Educa-tional Services. With approval of the Officeof the Provost, the Registrar's Office will posta W for all courses and notify all other rel- evant campus offices of your withdrawal. If you withdraw without notification, the date of withdrawal will not be known, andyou will not be entitled to Ws on your tran- script; grades will reflect instructors' ap-praisal of your overall performance, usuallyFX. If you officially withdraw from the Uni- versity near the end of a semester because ofacademic difficulty and receive WFs in courses for which you were registered, youmay, as a result of your new cumulativegrade point average, be academically dis-missed from the University. Once you withdraw, particularly for rea- sons other than medical, the University is notobliged to readmit you. Readmission espe-cially will not be approved if you withdrawto circumvent regulations. Call to Active Military Duty A student called to active military duty during a national or international crisis orconflict should inform the University of thereason for his/her withdrawal prior to leav-ing, including presentation of copies of ap-propriate military orders, in order to benefitfrom special policies and procedures govern-ing interruption of one's academic career forsuch military service. Please contact any oneof the following offices. The designated con-tact person in each office will assist in facili-tating your withdrawal and will contact otheroffices to insure that special exemptions con-cerning refunds and W or I grades are ap-plied: Veterans' Affairs Sand Spring Hall 110 Phone: 301/687-4409 Absence If you withdraw from Frostburg State Uni- versity with the intent to return within a se-mester or a year, you may request a leave ofabsence. If you are on an official leave of ab-sence, you will continue to receive commu-nications from the University, will not haveto submit a readmission application or ad-missions deposit, and will be able to partici-pate at the same time as continuing studentsin such activities as registration and the hous-ing lottery. You must notify the Financial AidOffice that you are on leave, and file financialaid and scholarship applications by the regu-lar deadlines. To be eligible for a leave of absence, you must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point av-erage at the end of your last term of enroll-ment, and have no judicial system penaltiesor charges pending. You may obtain an ap-plication for a leave of absence at theRegistrar's Office. The application requestsinformation about the reasons you are re-questing a leave, what activities you plan dur-ing the leave, and for how long you are re-questing a leave (one calendar year maxi-mum). Your advisor will need to sign off onyour application, which you then must re-turn to the Registrar's Office no later than thelast day of the drop/add (late registration)period in your first semester of leave. If you are planning study at another col- lege during your leave, you must completean Authorization to Attend Another Institu-tion form (available in the Registrar's Office)and obtain the required approvals. See thesection of this catalog on Attendance at An-other Institution concerning the rules fortransfer of credit for students seeking a de-gree at FSU. If you plan study abroad duringyour leave, you must use the procedurescurrently in place for international study, ad-ministered by the Center for InternationalEducation. You must keep the University informed of your permanent and local addresses duringyour leave in order to receive the privilegesspecified. If you do not enroll at the Univer-sity at the end of the time period specified inyour leave request, you will need to gothrough the readmission process wheneveryou return. Graduation To graduate with a baccalaureate degree, you must earn a minimum of 120 semesterhours of credit and fulfill all degree require-ments. Carrying a normal load of 15 semes-ter hours of credit each semester, you cancomplete a degree program in eight semes-ters. You may graduate in fewer than eightsemesters by attending summer sessions and/or Intersession, or by carrying more than15 semester hours per semester. To acceler-ate, you should plan your program well inadvance with your advisor. You may enroll as a part-time student, car- rying as many as 11 semester hours in theregular program. To graduate on a given date, you must make application on a form furnished by theRegistrar's Office. Submit the application tothe Registrar's Office when you complete 70credit hours, or at least one year prior to yourproposed graduation date. To participate in commencement, you must have successfully completed, or be en-rolled in the semester prior to the ceremony,in all course work required for you to com-plete your degree. If you complete your de-gree requirements in January or May, youare eligible to participate in the May com-mencement ceremony.

Exceptions to these rules require a written request to the Registrar's Office at least threeweeks prior to the commencement ceremony,accompanied by evidence that you have en-rolled in, and paid tuition for, course workthat will meet the remaining requirementsduring the summer session immediately fol-lowing May commencement or the JanuaryIntersession immediately following Decem-ber commencement. Permission will begranted only if you have no more than twocourses totaling no more than nine creditsremaining to complete your degree and havea 2.0 cumulative FSU grade point averageand a 2.0 cumulative FSU grade point aver-age in your major at the time of the request,as determined by the official degree auditperformed by the Registrar. Participation in commencement does not confer a degree. Your degree will be postedon your official transcript and you will re-ceive a diploma only after you have docu-mented that you have met all degree require-ments. Graduation with Honors If you have completed at least 50 credits at this University with a high cumulative gradepoint average, your scholastic achievementis recognized in the honors degree, awardedas follows: Cum and aboveACADEMIC REGULATIONS & PROCEDURES44 Academic Standards Grades Your progress as a student is evaluated and officially reported at the end of each se-mester. Letter grades are used to recordachievement. Generally, grades representstandards of comprehension of knowledgeand the ability to communicate knowledge,and are recorded on your permanent recordat the end of each semester. The grading symbols used at Frostburg State University are as follows: A Superior B Above average C Average D Passing, but below average F Failure P Pass PT Pass by examination W Withdrew WF Withdrew after the withdrawal deadline (counts as an F, failure) FX Withdrew unofficially (counts as an F, failure) NC No credit I Incomplete AU Audit (no credit earned) NR Grade not provided by instructor CS Continued Study Required (you must enroll in a course which satisfies the requirement in the nextsemester). Only available in English and mathemat-ics courses that meet Core Skills Requirements. N Non-pass (not permitted except where P/N is the only method of evaluation for a particular course) Incompletes The grade I (Incomplete) may be given at the instructor's discretion in exceptional,documented cases if, after completing mostof the work in a course, because of illness orother reasons beyond your control, you areunable to complete the remaining course re-quirements. An I may be removed and an-other grade substituted if you complete thecourse requirements to the instructor's satis-faction within six weeks of the beginning ofthe following semester. If you fail to removethe Incomplete within the prescribed period,the I will automatically be replaced by an Fon your permanent record. It is your respon-sibility to make arrangements to completethe course requirements for the removal ofthe I. Withdrawal W-Withdrew; WF-Withdrew After Dead- line (Failing); FX-Withdrew Unofficially(Failing). The FX will be given only if youhave failed to withdraw or drop officially orhave stopped going to class prior to the end of the semester. Failure to pass the coursebecause you did not take the final exam orcomplete other course requirements will berecorded as an F grade rather than an FX. NC Grade The grade NC (No Credit) is to be used at an instructor's option (instead of a grade ofF) if you have put forth effort to master thecontent of the course but have not achievedat a level to warrant a grade above F. The NCGrade may be used only if you have earnedfewer than 60 credits at the time grades areposted. Limited Pass/Fail Option You may take only one course per semes- ter on the Pass/Fail Option and no more thanfour courses Pass/Fail during your collegecareer. You will receive the grade of P foreach of these courses passed. Credits earnedin a course in which a P is received will becounted toward the number of semesterhours of credit required for graduation. Ifyou fail to do passing work in such a course,you will be graded F. The grade of P will notbe used in the computation of cumulativegrade point average; a grade of F will be com-puted. Upon approval of your advisor, at final registration or up to eleven class days fol-lowing registration, you may elect the P/Foption for a course by submitting a form tothe Registrar's Office. At no time during thesemester will an instructor be informed byany administrative office which students areenrolled for P/F credit. The instructor willassign grades of A, B, C, D, FX, or F to eachstudent, and the Registrar's Office will thenenter grades of P for students earning A, B,C, or D but will retain a grade of FX or F. If you wish to transfer or attend graduate school where letter grades are necessary, youmay request, in writing, that the Registrar'sOffice provide letter grades for those coursesin which a P was recorded. Courses in the undergraduate program may be taken for P/F credit with the follow-ing restrictions: 1. The P/F option is not permitted to be used in the General Education Program. 2. The P/F option may not be used for any course taught by your major or minor de-partment or which fulfills your major orminor requirements, including thosecourses which are required by, but offered outside of, the major or minor department. 3. If you are on academic probation, you are not eligible to enroll in a course on a P/Fbasis. 4. You may not elect to take more than one course per semester for P/F credit. Thetotal number of courses you may elect totake for P/F credits is four. 5. Once registered in a course on a P/F basis, you may not later choose to take the courseon the conventional letter-grade system,except as noted in number 6 below. 6. If you change your academic program so that a course previously taken for P/Fcredit becomes a requirement for a major,minor, or a professional program, you willreceive the conventional grade originallyreported by the instructor. 7. You may drop a P/F course the same as any other course. 8. You are subject to the same prerequisites and requirements for the course as is thestudent enrolled in the course under thestandard grading system. 9. To be eligible for the Dean's List, you must take 12 semester hours of graded credit;thus 9 graded credits and 3 credits on a P/F basis do not qualify you for consider-ation. Specifically, the P/F option may be used only for elective courses outside of the Gen-eral Education Program, majors, minors, andconcentrations. Mid-semester Warnings Faculty members will assess students' progress in all 100- and 200-level courses, andin all courses that meet Core Skills Require-ments in the General Education Program,prior to mid-semester. Students performingat the D or F quality level will be issued amid-semester warning early in the seventhweek of classes. Students are responsible fordiscussing their performance with their in-structors immediately.45ACADEMIC REGULATIONS & PROCEDURES Grade Points and Grade Point Averages A four-point system is used to indicate quality of academic work through a gradepoint average: Grade points per semester hour A4 B3 C2 D1 F, WF, FX 0 Grades of P, PT, N, NR, NC, I, W, AU, and CS are not used in computation of averages. The grade point average for a semester is determined by dividing the total number ofgrade points by the total number of semesterhours graded with A, B, C, D, F, WF, and FXthat semester. The cumulative grade point average is found by dividing the total grade pointsearned in all courses completed at Frost-burg State University by the total numberof semester hours graded with A, B, C, D,F, WF, and FX at FSU. For example: a juniorhas attempted 80 semester hours at Frost-burg and has earned a total of 192 gradepoints. The cumulative GPA is 2.40. If acourse is repeated, each grade earned is in-cluded in the computation. (See CourseRepetition section below for a limited, op-tional exception to this rule.) As with most colleges and universities, credit hours earned at other institutions areaccepted for transfer but grades are not. Con-sequently, the grades from transfer creditsare not computed into the cumulative gradepoint average at FSU. However, academicprogress is expected according to the totalcredit hours earned, including transfer cred-its. Calculation of GPA in Major: 1. All courses taken in the major department count in calculating the grade point av-erage for that major (unless specificallyexcluded). 2. Courses required for the major but taken outside the major department are notcounted in the computation, unless speci-fied in the catalog description of the ma-jor requirements. 3. Interdisciplinary majors, however, count all courses specifically listed as meetingthe requirements for the major. Interdis-ciplinary majors include Criminal Justice;Environmental Analysis and Planning;Earth Science; Health Science Adminis-tration; Information International Studies; Law andSociety; Liberal Studies; Social Science; and Urban and Regional Planning. 4. Prior written approval of the advisor and the department chair is required to repeata course in which a satisfactory grade hasbeen earned (whether a grade is consid-ered \"satisfactory\" in a given major isdefined by each department). 5. If a course is repeated, each grade earned is included in the computation. (SeeCourse Repetition section below for a lim-ited, optional exception to this rule.) Calculation of GPA in Minor: All courses required for the completion of a minor are used in calculating the gradepoint average. Course Repetition and Grading Any course taken at Frostburg State Uni- versity for the Core Skills Requirements ofthe General Education Program must be re-peated at FSU until a satisfactory grade isachieved \u2014 at least a C in all courses. A course may be counted toward gradua- tion requirements only once regardless ofhow many times it is repeated. All gradesearned during repeated courses are countedin your grade point average. (See the specialrule above concerning approvals required forcourse repetitions in your major.) You are permitted to repeat a maximum of 13 semester hours of course work in whichyou received a grade of D, F, FX, or WF. Thesecond grade received (A, B, C, D, F, FX orWF only), whether higher or lower, then will count in your cumulative grade point aver-age. The first grade will continue to appearon your transcript, but the credit hours at- tempted and the grade earned in the firstattempt will not be used in calculating thecumulative grade point average and cumu-lative credits. You may select this option onlyonce for a particular course. The course workmust be repeated at Frostburg State Univer-sity. To request implementation of this option, you must file the Repeat Grade Authoriza-tion Form, preferably at the time of initialregistration, but no later than the end of thedrop/add (late registration) period for thesemester in which the course is repeated. Ifyou previously have requested the option forthe maximum of 13 credits or for the samecourse, the Registrar's Office will deny therequest in person or by mail. This regulation applies only to courses re- peated in Fall 1993 or after. There will be noexceptions to the regulations stated. Youshould use this option carefully after consul-tation with your advisor. Dean's List Shortly after the end of each semester, the Dean of each School announces the names ofstudents recorded on the Dean's List.

The Educational Professions Department also offers approved teacher education programs leading to eligibility for certification in Secondary Education (biology, chemistry, English, foreign languages -French and Spanish, earth science, mathematics, physics, social studies), for grades 7-12 as well asmiddle school depending on subject area, and K-12 Education (art, music, health and physical educa-tion) for grades kindergarten-12. Requirements for these majors and programs are listed in the catalogunder Education: Early Childhood/Elementary Program, Elementary Program, Secondary SchoolPrograms, K-12 Programs and departments offering the areas of content specialization. The teacher education programs are committed to preparing professionals who are able to provide quality instruction, service, and leadership in a global community. The conceptual framework uponwhich each program rests focuses on the knowledge, skills and dispositions needed to develop power-ful learning communities. The university, the public schools, parents and other community memberslink together using their hands, heads and hearts to prepare the finest pre-service teacher candidates.Educational Professions' graduates are expected to be dedicated professionals, instructional leaders,continuous assessors, educational advocates, collaborative bridge-builders and reflective decision-makers. Eligibility for Teacher Certification in Maryland For eligibility for certification in the Early Childhood/Elementary program or the Elementary program, candidates must complete the approved program requirements as listed, university gradu-ation requirements and Praxis testing requirements. Passing Praxis II, demonstrating the knowledgeand skills of a specialized content area at the Maryland State Department of Education prescribed score,represents one qualification for completing the degree in teacher education or gaining teacher certifi-cation. Accordingly, candidates must pass Praxis II to become program completers and to graduate inan approved teacher education program. Completion of K-12 teacher education programs and thesecondary professional sequence requires passing Praxis II to be eligible and endorsed for certification. Candidates may apply for a certificate of eligibility directly to the Maryland State Department of Education or may apply for a Standard Professional Certificate I through the personnel office of acounty offering employment. Eligibility for Teacher Certification in Other States If candidates wish to gain a teaching license in a state other than Maryland, candidates need to check the certification requirements in the state(s) for the program in which they wish to teach, including thepassing standard for Praxis in that state. Having a Maryland certificate of eligibility may prove helpfulin the out-of-state certification effort. Approved Program Since NCATE (National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education) and the Maryland State Department of Education have approved FSU's teacher education programs, the Department of Edu-cational Professions authorizes the Registrar's Office to affix an approved program stamp on yourofficial transcript upon satisfactory completion of all requirements. Special Admission Criteria In addition to the requirements set forth in the summaries of requirements for majors in Early Childhood/Elementary and Elementary Education, the Professional Education Sequences for Second-ary Programs, and K-12 Programs (found in separate sections of this catalog), applicants must meet thefollowing phase admission requirements in order to be accepted into and complete an educationprogram.

Most law schools prefer that undergraduates interested in admissionto law school not follow a prescribed \" pre-law \" curriculum. Rather, they prefer that students pursue a broad, liberal education. Almost all professional law schools require applicants to take the Law School Aptitude Test. In some cases, the Graduate Record Exam may also be required. Information regarding the L.S.A.T. may beobtained from this university's pre-law advisor. Information regarding the G.R.E. may be obtainedfrom University Counseling and Psychological Services. Prospective law students should strive to acquire exceptional ability in communication; gain critical understanding of human values and institutions; and develop understanding in the use of varioustypes of reasoning: deductive, inductive, and analogous. Students should develop the ability to thinkcreatively and to analyze critically. They should also learn how to recognize, differentiate, and organizefacts according to their relevance to particular issues.

Students intending to enter health professions schools should plan their academic programs carefully to meet pre-professional, university and major requirements. 2. Pre-health professions students should continually examine the catalog of the institution they plan to attend in order to complete courses required by the professional school and to fulfill additionalentrance expectations. Students should bear in mind that requirements change and they should maintain contact with any professional schools they want to attend. 3. A science major is not a prerequisite for medical school; therefore, a major should be selected in which the student has a high aptitude and interest and which provides career alternatives. A proper courseselection is most important; consequently, we highly recommend early consultation with the chair ofthe department of your selected major, who will assign you to a pre-health professions advisor. 4. Most pre-health professions students at FSU select biology or chemistry as majors. The Pre-Health Professions Option outlined in the Biology section of this catalog should be selected by students majoring in Biology. Chemistry students planning medical school and other pre-health professionalprograms complete either the Biochemistry concentration or Traditional Track outlined for the Chem-istry major. Students opting to minor in either department are advised to use sections 5 and 6 belowas a guide to course selection. 5. Professional schools generally require a demonstrated proficiency in the basic sciences. The following courses are among the minimum requirements for students planning to prepare for medical, dental, optometry or veterinary school. BIOL 149 and 150 General Biology I and II 8 cr.

IMPLEMENTATION This policy as amended by the Board of Regents on April 11, 2003 shall be applied to all student residency classification decisions made on or after thisdate. FSU Procedure for Residency Status Appeals Any student who wishes to appeal the decision of residency status previ- ously determined by the Office of the Registrar or the Admissions Office, maydo so in writing to the Appeals Board for Residency Status. This board shallconsist of representatives designated by the Provost, the Vice President forStudent and Educational Services, and the Vice President for Administrationand Finance. The appeal will be reviewed by the board members in the orderlisted. Only by unanimous agreement of the board members will the decisionof the Office of the Registrar or Admissions be overruled. Upon request, thePresident or designee has the authority to waive any residency requirementsif it is determined that the student is indeed a permanent resident and appli-cation of the criteria creates an unjust result. A student desiring to appeal should obtain and submit the University System of Maryland \"Petition for Change in Residency Classification forAdmission, Tuition and Charge Differential\" through the office that made theoriginal residency status decision, the Office of the Registrar or the Admis-sions Office.arrangement, this benefit is available only for enrollment at the insti- tution awarding the assistantship. C. Students not entitled to In-State Status under the preceding paragraphs shall be assigned Out-of-State Status for admission, tuition, and charge-differential purposes. D. Assignment of In-State or Out-of-State classification will be made by the University upon an assessment of the totality of facts known or presentedto it. The person seeking In-State Status shall have the burden of provingthat he or she satisfies all requirements. E. Either of the following circumstances raise a presumption that the student is residing in the State of Maryland primarily for the purpose of attendingan educational institution: 1. The student was attending high school or residing outside Maryland at the time of application for admission to a USM institution, or 2. The student is both (a) not financially independent and (b) is finan- cially dependent upon a person not a resident of Maryland. The burden shall be on the student to rebut the presumption. II. PROCEDURES A. An initial determination of In-State Status will be made by the University at the time a student's application for admission is under consideration.The determination made at that time, and any determination made there-after, shall prevail for each semester/term until the determination is suc-cessfully challenged in a timely manner. B. A change in status must be requested by submitting a USM \"Petition for Change in Classification for Admission, Tuition and Charge Differential\".A student applying for a change to In-State Status must furnish all re-quired documentation with the Petition by the last published date toregister for the forthcoming semester/term for which the change in clas-sification is sought. C. The student shall notify the institution in writing within fifteen (15) days of any change in circumstances which may alter In-State Status. D. In the event incomplete, false, or misleading information is presented, the institution may, at its discretion, revoke in-state status and take disciplin-ary action provided for by the institution's policy. Such action may in-clude suspension or expulsion. If In-State Status is gained due to false ormisleading information, the University reserves the right to retroactivelyassess all Out-of-State charges for each semester/term affected. E. Each institution of the University System of Maryland shall develop and publish additional procedures to implement this policy. Procedures shallprovide that on request the President or designee has the authority towaive any residency criterion set forth in Section I if it is determined thatthe student is indeed a permanent resident and the application of thecriteria creates an unjust result. These procedures shall be filed with theOffice of the Chancellor. III. DEFINITIONS A.Financially Dependent: For the purposes of this policy, a financially dependent student is one who is claimed as a dependent for tax purposesor who receives more than one-half of his or her support from anotherperson during the twelve (12) month period immediately prior to the lastpublished date for registration for the semester or session. If a studentreceives more than one-half of his or her support in the aggregate frommore than one person, the student shall be considered financially depen-dent on the person providing the greater amount of support. B.Financially Independent: A financially independent student is one who (1) declares himself or herself to be financially independent as definedherein; (2) does not appear as a dependent on the Federal or State incometax return of any other person; (3) receives less than one-half of his or hersupport from any other person or persons; and (4) demonstrates that he orshe provides through self-generated support one-half or more of his orher total expenses.

The receivinginstitution shall inform a student of the courses which are acceptable fortransfer credit and the courses which are applicable to the student's in-tended program of study. (4) A receiving institution shall give a transfer student the option of satisfying institutional graduation requirements that were in effect at thereceiving institution at the time the student enrolled as a freshman at thesending institution. In the case of major requirements, a transfer student may satisfy the major requirements in effect at the time when the student was identifiable as pursuing the recommended transfer program at thesending institution. These conditions are applicable to a student who hasbeen continuously enrolled at the sending institution. .07 Programmatic Currency. A. A receiving institution shall provide to the community college current and accurate information on recommended transfer programs and thetransferability status of courses. Community college students shall haveaccess to this information. B. Recommended transfer programs shall be developed with each commu- nity college whenever new baccalaureate programs are approved by thedegree-granting institution. C. When considering curricular changes, institutions shall notify each other of the proposed changes that might affect transfer students. An appropri-ate mechanism shall be created to ensure that both 2-year and 4-yearpublic colleges provide input or comments to the institution proposingthe change. Sufficient lead time shall be provided to effect the change withminimum disruption. Transfer students are not required to repeat equiva-lent course work successfully completed at a community college. .08 Transfer Mediation Committee. A. There is be a Transfer Mediation Committee, appointed by the Secretary, which is representative of the public 4-year colleges and universities andthe community colleges. B. Sending and receiving institutions that disagree on the transferability of general education courses as defined by this chapter shall submit theirdisagreements to the Transfer Mediation Committee.

(5) The receiving baccalaureate degree-granting institution shall use vali- dation procedures when a transferring student successfully completes acourse at the lower division level that the receiving institution offers at theupper division level. The validated credits earned for the course shall besubstituted for the upper division course. D. Program Articulation. (1) Recommended transfer programs shall be developed through consul- tation between the sending and receiving institutions. A recommendedtransfer program represents an agreement between the two institutionsthat allows students aspiring to the baccalaureate degree to plan theirprograms. These programs constitute freshman/sophomore level coursework to be taken at the community college in fulfillment of the receivinginstitution's lower division course work requirement.

(3) A receiving institution shall include in the reports comparable infor- mation on the progress of native students. B. Transfer Coordinator. A public institution of higher education shall des- ignate a transfer coordinator, who serves as a resource person to transferUniversity Procedures for Reviewof Alleged Arbitraryand Capricious Grading Grounds for Grievance The following procedures implement the University System of Maryland Policy for Review of Alleged Arbitrary and Capricious Grading (BOR III-1.20)and are designed to provide a means for a student to seek review of finalcourse grades alleged to be arbitrary and capricious. In this policy the termarbitrary and capricious grading means 1) the assignment of a course grade to a student on some basis other than performance in the course; 2) the assign-ment of a course grade to a student by unreasonable application of standardsdifferent from the standards that were applied to other students in thatcourse; or 3) the assignment of a course grade by a substantial and unreason-able departure from the instructor's initially articulated standards. Alleging a final grade to have been determined in an arbitrary and capri- cious manner is the sole ground upon which a student may seek review underthese procedures. Since matters within the instructor's sphere of academicjudgment \u2014 such as choice of instructional and evaluation methods, criteria,and standards for evaluation \u2014 are not grounds for grievance, the burden ofproving arbitrary and capricious grading by clear and convincing evidencewill rest with the student. How to Undertake a Grade Grievance Students or faculty who desire additional information about the proce- dures that follow should contact the Assistant to the Provost. Stage I: Mediation A student seeking review for a final grade in a course should make a reasonable effort to confer with the instructor and attempt to resolve thematter informally. If this effort is unsuccessful, the student approaches thechair of the department offering the course to request mediation of the gradedispute. This action must be taken no later than the 15th class day of thesemester subsequent to the term in which the grade was received. The chairwill inform the student of the grounds proper to a grade grievance, as statedabove. The chair also will review relevant material and consult with theinstructor in an effort to resolve the issue of the grade. (If the instructorinvolved is the chair, the student approaches the senior faculty member in thedepartment to request mediation.) In cases where a resolution mutually acceptable to the student and the instructor is not forthcoming, and the student wishes to pursue a formalgrievance, the student may proceed to Stage II. Stage II: Formal Grievance As a precondition to filing a formal grievance, a student must fulfill all of his/her responsibilities and meet the deadline specified in Stage I: Mediationabove.students at either the sending or receiving campus. The transfer coordi- nator is responsible for overseeing the application of the policies andprocedures outlined in this chapter and interpreting transfer policies tothe individual student and to the institution. C. The Maryland Higher Education Commission shall establish a perma- nent Student Transfer Advisory Committee that meets regularly to re-view transfer issues and recommend policy changes as needed. TheStudent Transfer Advisory Committee shall address issues of interpre-tation and implementation of this chapter. Effective date: December 4, 1995 (22:24 Md. R. 1901)Regulations .02, .03, and .05 amended. Effective date: July 1, 1996 (23:13 Md. R. 946) Revised: February 11, 1998235POLICIES By the end of the 30th class day of the semester, a student wishing to grieve a grade must file a written grievance with the instructor's school dean. Thisgrievance must describe in detail the bases for the allegation that the gradewas arbitrary and capricious, and include all evidence supporting that claim.The student must send copies of this statement to the instructor and the chair. The dean will dismiss the grievance if the student 1) did not participate in Stage I: Mediation and/or meet the deadline specified in Stage I; 2) did not filethe Stage II appeal by the stated deadline; 3) does not furnish evidence thatthe allegations, if true, constitute arbitrary and capricious grading, as definedabove; and/or 4) has filed a complaint concerning the same grade with theOffice of Affirmative Action/EEO alleging discrimination or sexual harass-ment. If the grievance is not dismissed, the dean shall ask the instructor to respond to the grievance in writing within ten class days, addressing theresponse to the dean and copying the student and the chair. The dean will askthe chair to forward all documentary evidence collected during the media-tion stage to the dean. If the grievance is not dismissed, the dean shall appoint within ten class days a grade grievance committee of three tenured faculty members and shallschedule an informal, non-adversarial grade grievance hearing. The student,the instructor, and the chair will be invited to attend the hearing, and maypresent relevant evidence. The dean also will attend and may choose toparticipate in the discussion. In keeping with the informal nature of thehearing, neither the student nor the instructor may be accompanied by arepresentative or advisor. If the academic records of other students in thegrievant's class are relevant to the discussion, the grievant must be excusedfor that portion of the hearing in order to protect the privacy of other stu-dents. At the conclusion of the hearing, the committee shall forward itsrecommendation to the dean, who may accept, reject or alter the recommen-dation. The dean shall render a decision to the student in writing, either insupport of the original grade or of a grade change. If the dean recommends agrade change and the instructor refuses to change the grade, the dean willvacate and replace the grade in question. In deciding whether the circumstances justify changing the grade, the dean shall determine whether the grievant has provided clear and convincingevidence of arbitrary and capricious grading. Copies of the dean's decision, which shall be final, will be filed with the instructor and the chair.Student Records Annual Notification Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (commonly referred to as the \"Buckley Amendment\"), students have certain rights regarding theinspection and disclosure of education records directly related to the studentand maintained by the University. 1.
