PROTOCOL SUMMARY 1.1. Synopsis Short Title: A Phase 1/2 /3 Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy of RNA Vaccine Candidates Against COVID -19 in Healthy Individuals Rationale A pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan, China, was first reported in December 2019. On 08 January 2020, the pathogen causing this outbreak was identified as a novel coronavirus 2019. The outbreak was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020. On 12 February 2020 , the virus was officially named as severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS -CoV -2), and the WHO officially named the disease caused by SARS -CoV -2 as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19). On 11 March 2020 , the WHO upgraded the status of the COVID -19 outbreak from epidemic to pandemic , which is now spreading globa lly at high speed. There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent infection with SARS -CoV -2 or COVID -19. Given the rapid transmission of COV ID-19 and incidence of disease in the United States and elsewhere, the rapid development of an effective vaccine is of utmost importance. BioNTech has developed RNA -based vaccine candidates using a platform approach that enables the rapid development of vaccines against emerging viral diseases, including SARS -CoV -2. Each vaccine candidate is based on a platform of nucleoside -modified messenger RNA (modRNA , BNT162b ). Each vaccine candidate expresses 1 of 2 antigen s: the SARS (version 5 ). The 2 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine candidates that will be tested in this study are therefore : BNT162b1 (variant RBP020.3) : a modRNA encoding the RBD ; 2 (variant RBP020.2) : a modRNA enc oding P2 S. All candidates are formulated in the same lipid nanoparticle (LNP) composition . This study is intended to investigate the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of these prophylactic BNT162 vaccines against COVID -19.

HIV-positive participants in Phase 3 will not be included in analyses of the objectives, with the exception of the specifi c exploratory objective. b. See Section 6.1.1 for a description of the manufacturing process. Overall Design This is a Phase 1/2 /3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, placebo -controlled, observer -blind, dose -finding, vaccine candidate -selection , and efficacy study in healthy individuals . The study consists of 2 parts : Phase 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and do se level(s); Phase 2/3: an expanded cohort and efficacy part. These parts, and the progression between them, are detailed in the schema ( Section 1.2). The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 different SARS -CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidate s against C OVID -19 and the efficacy of 1 candidate : As a 2 -dose (separated by 21 days) schedule ; At various different dose levels in Phase 1 ; In 3 age groups ( Phase 1: 18 to 55 years of age, 65 to 85 years of age ; Phase 2/3: 12 years of age [stratified as 12-15, 16 -55, or >55 years of age] ). Dependent upon safety and/or immunogenicity data generated during the course of this study, or the BioNTech study conducted in Germany (BNT162 -01), it is possible that groups in Phase 1 may be started at the next highest dose , groups may not be started , groups may be terminated early , and /or groups may be added with dose levels below the lowest stated dose or intermediate between the lowest and highest stated doses. The vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation is BNT162b 2 at a dose of 30 \u00b5g. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 15 Numb er of Participants Each group in Phase 1 will comprise 15 participants (12 receiving active vaccine and 3 receiving placebo). In this phase , 13 groups will be studied, correspond ing to a total of 195 participants. The vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3, BNT162b 2 at a dose of 30 \u00b5g, will comprise 21,999 vaccine recipients . The 12 - to 15 -year stratum will comprise up to approximately 2000 participants ( 1000 vaccine recipients) enrolled at selected investigational sites. It is intended that a minimum of 40% of participants will be in the >55-year stratum. An equal number of participants will receive placebo, ie, randomized in a 1:1 ratio. Intervention Groups and Duration The study will evaluate a 2-dose (separated by 21 days) schedule of various different dose levels of 2 investigational RNA vaccine candidate s for active immunization against COVID -19 in 3 age groups ( Phase 1: 18 to 55 years of age , 65 to 85 years of age ; Phase 2/3: 12 years of age [stratified as 12-15, 16 -55, >55 years BNT162b1 RNA -LNP vaccine utilizing modRNA and the vaccine modRNA encoding P2 S ): 10 \u00b5g, 20 \u00b5g, 30 \u00b5g The vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation is BNT162b 2 at a dose of 30 \u00b5g. Participants are expected to participate for up to a maximum of approximately 26 mon ths. The duration of study follow -up may be shorter among participants enrolled in Phase 1 dosing arms that are not evaluated in Phase 2/ 3. Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight Committee The study will utilize an IRC, an internal Pfizer committee that will review data to allow dose escalation or changes to continuation of specific groups . An external data monitoring committee (DMC) will be formed and will review cumulative unblinded data thro ughout the study . Statistical Methods The sample size for Phase 1 of the study is not based on any statistical hypothesis testing. For Phase 2/3 , the VE evaluation will be the primary objective . The VE is defined as VE = 100 \u00d7 (1 - IRR), where IRR is calculated as the ratio of the first confirmed COVID -19 illness rate in the vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. With assumptions of a true VE of 60% and 4 IAs planned , 164 COVID -19 cases will provide 90% PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 16 powe r to conclude true VE > 30%. This would be achieved with a total 43,998 participants (21,999 vaccine recipients ), based on the assumption of a 1. 3% per year incidence in the placebo group, accrual of 164 primary -endpoint cases within 6 months, and 20% of the participants being nonevaluable. If the attack rate is much higher, case accrual would be expected to be more rapid, enabling the study's primary endpoint to be evaluated much sooner . The total number of participants enrolled in Phase 2/3 may vary de pending on the incidence of COVID -19 at the time of the enrollment , the true underlying VE, and a potential early stop for efficacy or futility . VE will be evaluated using a beta-binomial model and the posterior probability of VE being >30% will be assesse d. In Phase 3, up to approximately 2000 participants are anticipated to be 12 to 15 years of age. Noninferiority of immune response to prophylactic BNT162b2 in participants 12 to 15 years of age to response in participants 16 to 25 years of age will be ass essed based on the GMR of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing titers using a 1.5 -fold margin. A sample size of 200 evaluable participants (or 250 vaccine recipients) per age group will provide a power of 90.8% to declare the noninferiority in terms of GM R (lower limit of 95% CI for GMR >0.67). The primary safety objective will be evaluated by descriptive summary statistics for local reaction s, systemic events , AEs/SAEs , and abnormal hematology and chemistry laboratory parameters ( Phase 1 only), for each vacci ne group. A 3-tier approach will be used to summarize AEs in Phase 2/3 .

INTRODUCTION The BNT162 RNA -based COVID -19 vaccine s are currently being investigated for prevention of COVID -19 in healthy individuals . 2.1. Study Rationale The purpose of the study is to rapidly describe the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 BNT162 RNA -based COVID -19 vaccine candidates against COVID -19, and the efficacy of 1 candidate, in healthy individuals . There are currently no licensed vaccines to prevent infection with SARS -CoV -2 or COVID -19. Given the global crisis of COVID -19 and fast expansion of the disease in the United States and elsewhere, the rapid development of an effective vaccine is of utmost importance. 2.2. Background In December 2019, a pneumonia outbreak of u nknown cause occurred in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, it became clear that a novel coronavirus (2019 -nCoV) was the underlying cause. Later in January, the genetic sequence of the 2019 -nCoV became available to the World Health Organization (WHO) and public (MN908947.3), and the virus was categorized in the Betacoronavirus subfamily. By s equence analysis, the phylogenetic tree revealed a closer relationship to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus isolates than to another coronavirus infecting humans, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. SARS -CoV -2 infections and the resulting disease, COVID -19, have spread globally, affecting a growing number of countries. On 11 March 2020 , the WHO characterized the COVID -19 outbreak as a pandemic.1 The WHO Situation Update Report dated 30 March 2020 noted 693,224 confirmed cases with 33,106 deaths globally, including 142,081 confirmed cases with 2 457 deaths in the Americas .2 The United States currently has the most re ported cases globally. At the time of this communication, the number of confirmed cases continue s to rise globally. There are currently no vaccines or effective antiviral drugs to treat SARS -CoV -2 infections or the disease it causes, COVID -19.3 A prophylactic, RNA -based SARS -CoV -2 vaccine provides one of the most flexible and fastest approaches available to immunize against the emerging virus.4,5 The development of an RNA -based vaccine encoding a viral antigen, which is then expressed by the vaccine recipient as a protein capable of eliciting protective immune responses, provides sig nificant advantages over more traditional vaccine approaches. Unlike live attenuated vaccines, RNA vaccines do not carry the risks associated with infection and may be given to people who cannot be administered live virus (eg, pregnant women and immunocom promised persons). RNA -based vaccines are manufactured via a cell -free in vitro transcription process, which allows an easy and rapid production and the prospect of producing high numbers of vaccination doses within a shorter time period than achieved wit h traditional vaccine approaches. This capability is pivotal to enable the most effective response in outbreak scenarios. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 27 Two SARS -CoV -2-RNA lipid nanoparticle (RNA -LNP) vaccines based on nucleoside -modified messenger RNA (modRNA , BNT162b ) will be evaluated in this study . Each vaccine candidate expresses 1 of 2 antigens: the SARS -CoV -2 full -length, P2 mutant, spike glycoprotein -receptor binding domain (RBD) (version 5 ). The 2 SARS -CoV -2 vaccine candidates that will be tested in this study are therefore: BNT162b1 (variant RBP020.3) : nucleoside -modified messenger RNA (modRNA) with blunted innate immune sensor -activ ating capacity and augmented expression encoding the RBD (variant RBP020.2 ): nucleoside as above , but encoding P2 S. The vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation is BNT162b 2. 2.2.1. Clinical Overview Prior to t his study , given clinical data from other similarly formulated u RNA liposomal vaccines from BioNTech in oncology trials6 and recent published results from clinical trials using modRNA influenza vaccines by Moderna ,7 the BNT162 vaccines were expected to have a favorable safety profile with mild, localized , and transient effects. BNT162 vaccines based on modRNA have now been administered to humans for the first time in this study and the BNT162 -01 study conducted in Ger many by BioNTech, at doses between 1 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g. The currently availa ble safety and immunogenicity data are presented in the BNT162 IB. 2.3. Benefit/Risk Assessment There is an ongoing global pandemic of COVID -19 with no preventative or therapeutic options a vailable. While there were no data available from clinical trials on the use of BNT162 vaccines in humans at the outset of this study , available nonclinical data with these vaccines, and data from nonclinical studies and clinical trials with the same or related RNA components, or antigens, support ed a favorable risk /benefit profile. Anticipated AEs after vaccination were expected to be manageable using routine symptom -driven standard of care as determined by the investigators and, as a result, the profile of these vaccine candidate s support ed initiation of this Phase 1/2 /3 clinical study . Updates as part of protocol amendment 6: In order for the overall Phase 3 study populati on to be as representative and diverse as possible, the inclusion of participants with known chronic stable HIV, HCV, or HBV infection is permitted. Individuals with chronic viral diseases are at increased risk for COVID -19 complications and severe diseas e. In addition, with the currently available therapies for the ir treatment, many individuals with chronic stable HIV, HCV, and HBV infections are unlikely to be at higher safety risk as a PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 28 participant in this vaccine study than individuals with other chron ic stable medical conditions. All participants with chronic stable HIV disease will be included in the reactogenicity subset (see Section 8.2.2). Updates as part of protocol amendment 7: The minimum age for inclusion in Phase 3 is lowered to 12 years, therefore allowing the inclusion of participants 12 to 15 years of age. For individuals 12 to 15 years of age, the immune responses in this age group may be higher and reactogenicity is expected to be similar to younger adults 18 t o 25 years of age. Inclusion of individuals 12 to 15 years of age was based upon a satisfactory b linded safety profile in participants 18 to 25 years of age . All participants 12 to 15 years of age will be included in the reactogenicity subset (see Section 8.2.2 ). More detailed information about the known and expected benefits and risks and reasonably expected AEs of BNT162 RNA -based COVID -19 vaccine s may be found in the IB, which is the SRSD for this study.

Risk Assessment Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Study Intervention : BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccine Potential for local reactions (injection site redness, injection site swelling, and injection site pain) and systemic events (fever, fatigue, headache, chills, vomiting, diarrhea, muscle pain, and joint pain) following vaccination. These are c ommon adverse reactions seen with other vaccines, as noted in the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) guidelines on toxicity grading scales for healthy adult volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials.8 The Phase 1 study design includes the use of controlled vaccination and dose escalation to closely monitor and limit the rate of enrollment to ensure participant safety. The study employs the u se of a reactogenicity e-diary to monitor local reactions and systemic events in real time. Stopping rules are also in place. The first 5 participant s in each group in Phase 1 will be observed for 4 hours after vaccination to assess any immediate AEs. All other participants will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Unknown AEs and laboratory abnormalities with a novel vaccine. This study is one of the first 2 parallel -running clinical studies with the BNT162 vaccine candidates and as such there are no clinical data available for t his vaccine. The Phase 1 study design includes the use of controlled vaccination and dose escalation to closely monitor and limit the rate of enrollment to ensure participant safety. An IRC (in Phase 1) and DMC (throughout the study) will also review safety data. Stopping rules ar e also in place. The first 5 participants in each group in Phase 1 will be observed for 4 hours after vaccination to assess any immediate AEs. All other participants will be observed for at least 30 minutes after vaccination. Potential for COVID -19 enhancement. Disease enhancement has been seen following vaccination with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ), feline coronavirus , and Dengue virus vaccines . Phase 1 excludes participant s with likely previous or current COVID -19. In Phase 2/ 3, temporary delay criteria defer vaccination of participants with symptoms of potential COVID -19. All participants are followed for any potential COVID -19 illness , including markers of severity , and have blood samples taken for potential measurement of SA RS-CoV -2 antigen -specific antibody and SARS -CoV RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 30 Potential Risk of Clinical Significance Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk Mitigation Strategy Study Procedures Participant s will be required to attend healthcare facilities during the global SARS -CoV -2 pandemic. Without appropriate social distancing and PPE, there is a potential for increased exposure to SARS -CoV -2. Pfizer will work with sites to ensure an appropriate COVID -19 prevention strategy. Potential COVID -19 illness visits can be conducted via t elehealth , without the need for an in -person visit, if required, with the participant performing a self -swab. Venipuncture will be performed during the study. There is the risk of bleeding, bruising, hematoma formation, and infection at the venipuncture site. Only appropriately qualified personnel would obtai n the blood draw . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 31 2.3.2. Benefit Assessment Benefit s to individual participants may include: Receipt of a potentially efficacious COVID -19 vaccine during a global pandemic Access to COVID -19 diagnostic testing Contributing to research to help others in a time of global pandemic 2.3.3. Overall Benefit /Risk Conclusion Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants participating in this study, the potential risks identified in association with BNT 162 RNA -based COVID -19 vaccine are justified by the anticipated benefits that may be afforded to healthy participants . 3.

Overall Design This is a multicenter, multinational, Phase 1/2 /3, randomized, placebo -controlled, observer -blind, dose -finding, vaccine candidate -selection , and efficacy study in healthy indiv idual s. The study consists of 2 parts. Phase 1: to identify preferred vaccine candidate(s) and dose level(s); Phase 2/3: an expanded cohort and efficacy part. These parts, and the progression between them, are detailed in the schema ( Section 1.2). The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 2 different SARS -CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidate s against C OVID -19 and the efficacy of 1 candidate : As a 2 -dose (separated by 21 days) schedule ; At various different dose levels in Phase 1 ; In 3 age groups ( Phase 1: 18 to 55 years of age, 65 to 85 years of age ; Phase 2/3: 12 years of age [stratified as 12-15, 16 -55, or >55 years of age] ). Dependent upon safety and/or immunogenicity data generated during the course of this study, or the BioNTech study conducted in Germany (BNT162 -01), it is possible that groups in Phase 1 may be started at the next highest dose , groups may not be started , groups may be terminated early , and /or groups may be added with dose levels below the lowest stated dose or intermediate between the lowest and highest stated doses . The study i s observer -blinded, as the physical appearance of the investigational vaccine candidates and the placebo may differ. The participant, investigator, study coordinator, and other site staff will be blinded. At the study site, only the dispenser(s)/administr ator(s) are unblinded. To facilitate rapid review of data in real time, sponsor staff will be unblinded to vaccine allocation for the participants in Phase 1. 4.1.1. Phase 1 Each group (vaccine candidate/dose level/ age group ) will comprise 15 participant s; 12 participants will be randomized to receive active vaccine and 3 to receive placebo. For each vaccine candidate /dose level /age group , the following apply: Additional safety assessments (see Section 8.2) PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 37 Controlled enrollment (required only for the first candidate and/or dose level studied) : No more than 5 participants (4 active, 1 placebo) can be vaccinated on the first day The first 5 participants must be observed by blinded site staff for at least 4 hours after vaccination for any acute reactions Vaccination of the remaining participants will commence no sooner than 24 hours after the fifth participant received his or her vaccination Application of stopping rules IRC review of safety data to determine escalation to the next dose level in the 18 - to 55-year age cohort : Escalation between dose levels will be based on IRC review of at least 7 -day post-Dose 1 safety data in this study and/or the BioNTech study conducted in Germany (BNT162 -01) Note that, since both candidates are based upon the same RNA platform, dose escalation for the second candidate studied may be based upon the safety profile of the first candidate stu died being deemed acceptable at the same , or a higher, dose level by the IRC Groups of participants 65 to 85 years of age will not be started until safety data for the RNA platform have been deemed acceptable at the same, or a higher, dose level in the 18 - to 55-year age cohort by the IRC. In this phase , 13 groups will be studied , correspond ing to a total of 195 participants. The IRC will select 1 vaccine candidate that, in Phase 1, has an established dose level per age group based on induction of a post-Dose 2 immune response, including neutralizing antibodies, which is expected to be associated with protection against COVID -19, for progress ion into Phase 2/ 3. 4.1.2. Phase 2/ 3 On the basis of safety and/or immunogenicity data generated during the course of this study, and/or the BioNTech study conducted in Germany (BNT162 -01), 1 vaccine candidate was selected to proceed into Phase 2/ 3. Participants in this phase will be 12 years of age, stratified as follows : 12 to 15 years, 16 to 55 years , or >55 years. The 12 - to 15 -year stratum will comprise up to approximately 2000 participants enrolled at selected investigational sites. It is intended that a minimum of 40% of participants will be in the >55-year st ratum. Commencement of each age strat um will be based upon satisfactory post-Dose 2 safety and immunogenicity data from the 18 - to 55 -year and 65 - to 85 -year age groups in Phase 1, PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 38 respectively. The vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation is BNT162b 2 at a dose of 30 \u00b5g. Phase 2/ 3 is even t-driven. Under the assumption of a true VE rate of 60%, after the second dose of investigational product, a target of 164 primary -endpoint cases of confirmed COVID -19 due to SARS -CoV -2 occurring at least 7 days following the second dose of the primary series of the candidate vaccine will be sufficient to provide 90% power to conclude true VE >30% with high probability. The to tal number of participants enrolled in Phase 2/ 3 may vary depending on the incidence of COVID -19 at the time of the enrollment, the true underlying VE, and a potential early stop for efficacy or futility. Assuming a COVID -19 attack rate of 1. 3% per year in the placebo gr oup, accrual of 164 first primary -endpoint cases within 6 months, an estimated 20% nonevaluable rate , and 1:1 randomization, the BNT162b 2 vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/ 3 is expected to comprise approximately 21,999 vaccine recipients . This is t he number of participants initially targeted for Phase 2/ 3 and may be adjusted based on advice from DMC analyses of case accumulation and the percentage of participants who are se ropositive at baseline. Dependent upon the evolution of the pandemic, it is possible that the COVID -19 attack rate may be much higher, in which case accrual would be expected to be more rapid, enabling the study's primary endpoint to be evaluated much soo ner. The first 360 participants enrolled (180 to active vaccine and 180 to placebo , stratified equally between 18 to 55 years and >55 to 85 years ) will comprise the \"Phase 2\" portion . Safety data through 7 days after D ose 2 and immunogenicity data through 1 month after Dose 2 from these 360 participants will be analyzed by the unblinded statistical team, reviewed by the DMC, and submitted to appropriate regulatory authorities for review. Enrol lment may continue during this pe riod and these participants would be included in the efficacy evaluation in the \"Phase 3\" portion of the study. In Phase 3, up to approximately 2000 participants , enrolled at selected sites, are anticipated to be 12 to 15 years of age. Noninferiority of immune response to prophylactic BNT162b2 in participants 12 to 15 years of age to response in participants 16 to 25 years of age will be assessed based on the GMR of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing t iters using a 1.5 -fold margin. A sample size of 200 evaluable participants (or 250 vaccine recipients) per age group will provide a power of 90.8% to declare the noninferiority in terms of GM R (lower limit of 95% CI for GMR >0.67) . A random sample of 250 participant s from each of the 2 age group s (12 to 15 years and 16 to 25 years) will be selected as an immunogenicity subset for the noninferiority assessment. The initial BNT162b2 using \"Process 1\" ; however , \"Process 2\" was developed to support an increased scale of manufacture. In the study , each lot of \"Process 2\"-manufactured BNT162b2 will be administered to approximately 250 participants 16 to 55 years of age . The safety and immunogenicity of prophylactic BNT162b 2 in individuals 16 to 55 years of age vaccinated with \"Process 1\" and each lot of \"Process 2\" study intervention will be described. A random sample of 250 participants from those PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 39 vaccinated with study intervention produced by manufacturing \"Process 1\" will be selected for th is descriptive analysis . Participants are expected to participate for up to a maximum of approximately 26 months. The duration of study follow -up may be shorte r among participants enrolled in Phase 1 dosing arms that are not evaluated in Phase 2/ 3. 4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design Additional surveillance for COVID -19 will be conducted as part of the study, given the potential risk of disease enhancement. If a participant experiences symptoms, as detailed in Section 8.13, a COVID -19 illness and subsequent convalescent visit will occur. As part of these visits , samples ( nasal [midturbinate ] swab and blood) will be taken for antigen and antibody assessment as well as recording of COVID -19-related clinical and laboratory information (including local diagnosis) . Human reproductive safety data are not available for BNT162 RNA -based COVID -19 vaccine s, but there is no suspicion of human teratogenicity based on the intended mechanism of action of the compound. Therefore, the use of a highly effective method of contra ception is required (see Appendix 4 ). 4.3. Justification for Dose Because of the requirement for a rapid response to the newly emerged COVID -19 pandemic, sufficient data were not available to experimentally validate the dose selection and initial starting dose. Therefore, the original planned starting dose of 10 \u00b5g (for both BNT162b1 and BNT162b2) in this study was based on nonclinical experience with the same RNAs encoding other viral antigens (such as influenza an d HIV antigens). The general safety and effectiveness of uRNA and modRNA platforms have been demonstrated in oncological clinical trials with different administration routes (NCT02410733, NCT03871348). Doses of up to 400 \u00b5g total uRNA have been administered IV as RNA lipoplex (RNA -LPX) and doses of up to 1000 \u00b5g total naked modRNA have been administered intratumorally, both without signs of unpredictable overstimulation of the immune system. Based on nonclinical data of the RNA components, with o ther liposomes or in conjunction with the lipid nanoparticles as will be tested clinically in this study , it was expect ed that doses in the 1 - to 5-\u00b5g range would be immunogenic and induce neutralizing antibodies ; however , it was anticipated that 3- to 10 -fold higher doses would likely be required to elicit a stronger antibody response. Based on previous clinical and nonclinical experience, it was expected that doses of up to 100 \u00b5g would be well tolerated . Update as part of protocol amendment 2: prelimina ry experience in this study and the BioNTech study conducted in Germany (BNT162 -01) suggests that, for vaccine candidates based on the modRNA platform, a dose level between 3 0 \u00b5g and 10 0 \u00b5g warrants consideration. Therefore , a 50-\u00b5g dose level is formally included for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 40 Update as part of protocol amendment 3: as data have become available from this study and the BNT162 -01 study in Germany, it was decided : To not study the BNT162a1 and BNT162c2 vaccine candidates at this time, so these candidates have been removed from the protocol; and That lower dose levels of BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 warrant consideration. Therefore, a 2 0-\u00b5g dose level is formally included for both candidates . Update as part of protocol amendment 4: the 5 0-\u00b5g dose level for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2 is removed and the 100-\u00b5g dose level for BNT162b2 is removed ; similar dose levels of BNT162b3 may be studied as for BNT162b1 and BNT162b2. Update as part of protocol amendment 5: the vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation is BNT162b 2 at a dose of 30 \u00b5g. BNT162b3 will not be studied. 4.4. End of Study Definition A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all phases of the study , including the last visit . Note that participants enrolled in Phase 1 in groups that do not proceed to Phase 2/ 3 may be followed for fewer than 24 months (but no less than 6 months after the last vaccination). The end of the study is defined as the date of last visit of the last participant in the study. 5.

Each vial will be labeled as required per country requir ement Study intervention will be provided in a glass vial as open -label supply. Each vial will be labeled as required per country requirement Study intervention will be provided in a glass or plastic vial as open -label supply. Each vial will be labeled as required per country requirement a. Dependent upon safety and/or immunogenicity data generated during the course of this study, or the BioNTech study conducted in Germany (BNT162 -01), it is possible that groups may be started at the next highest dose, groups may not be started, groups may be terminated early, and/or groups may be added with dose levels below the lowest stated dose or intermediate between the lowest and high est stated doses . The vaccine candidate selected for Phase 2/3 evaluation is BNT162b 2 at a dose of 30 \u00b5g. 6.1.1. Manufacturing Process The scale of the BNT162b2 manufacturing has been increased to support future supply. BNT162b2 generated using the manufacturing process supporting an increased supply (\"Process 2 \") will be administered to approximately 250 participants 16 to 55 years of age, per lot, in the study. The safety and immunogenicity of prophylactic BNT162b2 in individuals 16 to 55 years of age vaccinated with material generated using the existing manufacturing process \"Process 1 ,\" and with material from lots generated using the manufacturing process supporting increased supply , \"Process 2 ,\" will be described. In brief, the process changes r elate to the method of production for the DNA template that RNA drug substance is transcribed from, and the RNA drug substance purification method. The BNT162b2 drug product is then produced using a scaled -up LNP manufacturing process. 6.1.2. Administration Participants will receive 1 dose of study intervention as randomized at each vaccination visit (Visits 1 and 4 for Phase 1 participants, Visits 1 and 2 for Phase 2/3 participants ) in accordance with the study's SoA. The volume to be adm inistered may vary by vaccine candidate and dose level; full details are described in the IP manual. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 47 Study intervention should be administered intramuscularly into the deltoid muscle , preferabl y of the nondominant arm , by an unblinded administrator . Standard vaccination practices must be observed and vaccine must not be injected into blood vessels. Appropriate medication and other supportive measures for management of an acute hypersensitivity reaction should be available in accordanc e with local guidelines for standard immunization practices. Administration of study interventions should be performed by an appropriately qualified, GCP -trained, and vaccine -experienced member of the study staff (eg, physician, nurse, physician's assistan t, nurse practitioner, pharmacist, or medical assistant) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance. Study intervention administration details will be recorded on the CRF. 6.2. Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 1. The investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have been maintained during transit for all study intervention s received and any discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the study intervention. 2. Only participants enrolled in the study may rece ive study intervention and only authorized site staff may supply or administer study intervention. All study intervention s must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated recording ) area in accordance with the la beled storage conditions with access limited to the investigator and authorized site staff. At a minimum, daily minimum and maximum temperatures for all site storage locations must be documented and available upon request. Data for nonworking days must indicate the minimum and maximum temperature s since previously documented for all site storage locations upon return to business. 3. Any excursions from the study intervention label storage conditions should be reported to Pfizer upon discovery along with any actions taken. The site should actively pursue options for returning the study intervention to the storage conditions described in the labeling, as soon as possible. Once an excursion is identified, the study intervention must be quarantined and not used until Pfizer provides permission to use the study intervention. Specific details regarding the definition of an excursion and information the site should report for each excursion will be provided to the site in the IP manual. 4. Any storage conditions stated in the SRSD will be superseded by the storage conditions stated on the label. 5. Study interventions should be stored in their original containers. 6. See the IP manual for storage conditions of the study intervention . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 48 7. The investigator, institu tion, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is responsible for study intervention accountability, reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records) , such as the IPAL or sponsor -approved equivalent . All study intervention s will be accounted for using a study intervention accountability form/record. 8. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused study interventions are provided in the IP manua l. All destruction must be adequately documented. If destruction is authorized to take place at the investigator site, the investigator must ensure that the materials are destroyed in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, institutional policy, and any special ins tructions provided by Pfizer. Upon identification of a product complaint, notify the sponsor w ithin 1 business day of discovery as described in the IP manual. 6.2.1. Preparation and Dispensing See the IP manual for instructions on how to prepare the study intervention for administration. Study intervention should be prepared and dispensed by an appropriately qualified and experienced member of the study staff (eg, physician, nurse, physician's assistant, nurse p ractitioner, pharmacy assistant/technician, or pharmacist) as allowed by local, state, and institutional guidance. A second staff member will verify the dispensing. Study intervention and placebo will be prepared by qualified unblinded site personnel according to the IP manual. The study intervention will be administered in such a way to ensure the participant s remain blinded . 6.3. Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 6.3.1. Allocation to Study Intervention Allocation (randomiz ation) of participants to vaccine groups will proceed through the use of an IRT system (IWR). The site personnel (study coordinator or specified designee) will be required to enter or select information inc luding but not limited to the user's ID and password, the protocol number, and the participant number. The site personnel will then be provided with a vaccine assignment and randomization number. The IRT system will provide a confirmation report containi ng the participant number, randomization number, and study intervention allocation assigned. The confirmation report must be stored in the site's files. The study -specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT system. 6.3.2. Blinding of Site Personnel In this observer blinded study, the study staff receiving, storing, dispensing, preparing, and administering the study interventions will be unblinded. All other study and site personnel, including the investigator, investigator staff, and participants , will be blinded to study PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 49 intervention assignments. In particular, t he individuals who evaluate participant safety will be blinded. Because the BNT162 RNA -based COVID -19 vaccine candidates and placebo are different in physical appearance, the study intervention syringes will be administered in a manner that prevents the s tudy participants from identifying the study intervention type based on its appearance. The responsibility of the unblinded dispenser and administrator must be assigned to an individual or individuals who will not participate in the evaluation of any study participants. Contact between the unblinded dispenser and study participants and unblinded administrator and study participants should be kept to a minimum. The remaining site personnel must not know study intervention assignments. 6.3.3. Blinding of the Spons or To facilitate rapid review of data in real time, sponsor staff will be unblinded to study intervention allocation for the participants in Phase 1. The majority of sponsor staff will be blinded to study intervention allocation in Phase 2/ 3. All laborat ory testing personnel performing serology assays will remain blinded to study intervention assigned/received throughout the study. The following sponsor staff , who will have no part in the blinded conduct of the study, will be unblinded in Phase 2/3 (further details will be provided in a data blinding plan) : Those study team members who are involved in ensuring that protocol requirements for study intervention preparation, handling, allocation, and administration are fulfilled at the site will be unblinded for the duration of the study (eg, unblinded study manager, unblinded clinical research associate). Unblinded clinician (s), who are not direct member s of the study team and will not participate in any other study -related activities , will review unblinded protocol deviations. An unblinded team supporting interactions with, and analyses for, the DMC (see Section 9.6 ). This will comprise a statistician, programmer(s), a clinical scientist, and a medical monitor who will review cases of severe COVID -19 as they are received , and will review AEs at least weekly for additional potential cases of severe COVID -19 (see Section 8.2.3 ). An unblinded submissions team will be responsible for preparing unblinded analyses and documents to support regulatory activities that may be required while the study is ongoing. This team will only be unblinded at the group level and not have access to individual participant assignments. The programs that produce the summary tables will be developed and validated by the blinded study team, and these programs will be run by the unblinded DMC team . The submissions team will not have access to unblinded COVID -19 cases unless efficacy is ach ieved in either an interim analysis or the final analysis , as determined by the DMC. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 50 6.3.4. Breaking the Blind The IRT will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if u nblinding of a participant's study intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make ever y effort to contact the sponsor prior to unblinding a participant's vaccine assignment unless this could delay further management of the participant. If a participant's vaccine assignment is unblinded, the sponsor must be notified within 24 hours after br eaking the blind. The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documentation and CRF. The study -specific IRT reference manual and IP manual will provide the contact information and further details on the use of the IRT syst em. 6.4. Study Intervention Compliance When participants are dosed at the site, they will receive study intervention directly from the investigator or designee, under medical supervision. The date and time of each dose administered in the clinic will be record ed in the source documents and recorded in the CRF. The dose of study intervention and study participant identification will be confirmed at the time of dosing by a member of the study site staff other than the person administering the study intervention. 6.5. Concomitant Therapy The following concomitant medications and vaccinations will be recorded in the CRF: All vaccinations received from 28 days prior to study enrollment until the 6 -month follow -up visit (Visit 8 for Phase 1 participants, and Visit 4 for Phase 2/ 3 participants) . Prohibited med ications listed in Section 6.5.1 will be record ed, to include start and stop dates, name of the medication, dose, unit, route , and frequency. In addition, for participant s enrolled in Phase 1, all current medication at baseline will be recorded, to include start date, name of the medication, dose, unit , route , and frequency. 6.5.1. Prohibited During the Study Receipt of the following vaccines and medications during the time periods listed below may exclude a participant from the per -protocol analysis from that point onwards , and may require vaccinations to be discontinued in that participant ; however, it is anticipated that the participant would not be withdrawn from the study (see Section 7). Medications should not be withheld if required for a participant's medical care. Unless considered medically necessary, no vaccines other than study intervention should be administered w ithin 28 days before and 28 days after each study vaccination . One exception PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 51 to this is that seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccine can be given at least 14 days after, or at least 14 days prior to, the administration of study intervention . Receipt of ch ronic systemic treatment with known immunosuppressant medications, or radiotherapy, within 6 0 days before enrollment through conclusion of the study. Receipt of systemic corticosteroids ( 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) fo r 14 days is prohibited fr om 28 days prior to enrollment to Visit 7 for Phase 1 participants, and Visit 3 for Phase 2/ 3 participants) . Receipt of inhaled/nebulized corticosteroids from 28 days prior to enrollment to Visit 7 (1-month follow -up visit) for Phase 1 participants . Receipt of blood /plasma products or immunoglobulins within 6 0 days before enrollment through conclusion of the study. Receipt of any other (nonstudy) coronavirus vaccine at any time prior to or during study participation is prohibited. Proph ylactic antipyretics and other pain medication to prevent symptoms associated with study intervention administration are not permitted. However, if a participant is taking a medication for another condition, even if it may have antipyretic or pain -relievi ng properties, it should not be withheld prior to study vaccination. 6.5.2. Permitted During the Study The use of antipyretics and other pain medication to treat symptoms associated with study intervention administration or ongoing conditions is permitted. Medica tion other than that described as prohibited in Section 6.5.1 required for treatment of preexisting stable conditions is permitted. Inhaled (except in Phase 1 participants - see Section 6.5.1 ), topical, or localized injections of corticosteroids (eg, intra -articular or intrabursal administration) are permitted. 6.6. Dose Modification This protocol allows some alteration of vaccine dose for individual participants and/or dose groups from the currently o utlined dosing schedule. For reasons of reactogenicity, tolerability, or safety, the IRC may recommend to reduce the second dose of study intervention and/ or increase the interval between doses. If, due to a medication error, a participant receives 1 dose of BNT162b2 at Visit 1 and 1 dose of placebo at Visit 2 (or vice versa), the participant should be offered the possibility to receive a second dose of BNT162b2 at an unscheduled visit. In this situation : Obtain informed consent for administ ration of the additional dose. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 52 Measure the participant's body temperature. Perform urine pregnancy test on WOCBP as described in Section 8.2.6 . Discuss contraceptive use as described in Section 10.4. Ensure that the participant meets none of the temporary delay criteria as described in Section 5.5. Unblinded site staff member(s) will dispense/administer 1 dose of study intervention into the deltoid muscle of the preferably nondominant arm. Please refer to the IP manual for further instruction on this process. Blinded site staff must observe the participant for at least 30 minutes after study intervention administration for any acute reactions. Record any acute reactions (including time of onset) in the participant's source documents and on the AE page of the CRF, and on an SAE form a s applicable. The participant should continue to adhere to the normal visit schedule but must be followed for nonserious AEs for 1 month and SAEs for 6 months after the second dose of BNT162b2. This will require AEs to be elicited either by unscheduled telephone contact(s) and/or in -person visit(s). 6.7. Intervention After the End of the Study No intervention will be provided to study participants at the end of the study. 7. DISCONTINUATION OF STUDY INTERVENTION AND PARTICIPANT DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL 7.1. Discontin uation of Study Intervention In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study intervention (definitive discontinuation) . Reasons for definitive discontinuation of study intervention may include the following : AEs; participant request; investigator request ; pregnancy; protocol deviation (including no longer meeting all the inclusion criteria, or meeting 1 or more exclusion criteria) . In general, unless the investigator considers it unsafe to administe r the second dose, or the participant does not wish to receive it, it is preferred that the second dose be administered. Note that a positive SARS -CoV -2 NAAT result without symptoms does not meet exclusion criterion 5 and should not result in discontinuati on of study intervention , whereas a COVID -19 diagnosis does meet exclusion criterion 5 and should result in discontinuation of study intervention (see Section 8.15). Note that discontinuation of study intervention does not represent withdrawal from the study. Per the study estimands, if study intervention is definitively discontinued, the participant will remain in the study to be evaluated for safety , immunogenicity , and efficacy . See the SoA for data to be collected at the time of discontinuation of study intervention and follow -up for any further evaluations that need to be completed. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 53 In the event of discontinuation of study intervention, it must be documented on the appropriate CRF/in the m edical records whether the participant is discontinuing further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures, posttreatment study follow -up, and/or future collection of additional information. 7.2. Participant Discontinuation/ Withdrawal From the Study A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request . Reasons for discontinuation from the study may include the following: Refused further follow -up; Lost to follow -up; Death ; Study terminated by sponsor ; AEs; Participant re quest; Investigator request; Protocol deviation . If a participant does not return for a scheduled visit, every effort should be made to contact the participant. All attempts to contact the participant and information received during contact attempts must be documented in the participant's source document. In any circumstance, every effort should be made to document participant outcome, if possible. The investigator or his or her designee should capture the reason for withdrawal in the CRF for all partici pants. If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any remaining samples taken and not tested , and the investigator must document any such requests in the site study records and notify the sponsor accordingly . If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent (see Section 7.2.1 ) for disclosure of future information, no further evaluations should be performed and no additional data should be collected. The sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. Lack of completion of all or any of the withdrawal/early termination procedures will not be viewed as protocol deviations so long as the participant 's safety was preserved. 7.2.1. Withdrawal of Consent Participant s who request t o discontinue receipt of study intervention will remain in the study and must continue to be followed for protocol -specified follow -up procedures. The only exception to this is when a participant specifically withdraws consent for any further contact PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 54 with him or her or persons previously authorized by the participant to provide this information. Participant s should notify the investigator in writing of the decision to withdraw consent from future follow -up, whenever possible. The withdrawal of consent should be explained in detail in the medical records by the investigator, as to whether the withdrawal is only from further receipt of study intervention or also from study procedures and/or posttreatment s tudy follow -up, and entered on the appropriate CRF page. In the event that vital status (whether the participant is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available information should be used to determine vital status only as appropriately directed in accordance with local law. 7.3. Lost to Follow-up A participant will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site. The following actions must be taken if a particip ant fails to attend a required study visit: The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in the study ; Before a participant is deemed lost to follow -up, the investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if ne cessary, a certified letter to the participant's last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant's medical record ; Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be co nsidered to have withdrawn from the study. 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES The investigator (or an appropriate delegate at the investigator site) must obtain a signed and dated ICD before performing any study -specific procedures. The full date of birth will be collected to critically evaluate the immune response and safety profile by age. Study procedures and their timing are summarized in the SoA. Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed. Safety issues should be discu ssed with the sponsor immediately upon occurrence or awareness to determine whether the participant should continue or discontinue study intervention. Adherence to the study design requirements, including those specified in the SoA, is essential and required for study conduct. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 55 All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record details of all participant s screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, as applicable. Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol -required tests and procedures are completed as described. However, it is anticipated that from time to time t here may be circumstances outside the control of the investigator that may make it unfeasible to perform the test. In these cases, the investigator must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well-being of the participant . When a protocol -required test cannot be performed, the investigator will document the reason for the missed test and any corrective and preventive actions that he or she has taken to ensure that required processes are adhered to as soon as possible. The study team must be in formed of these incidents in a timely manner. For samples being collected and shipped, detailed collection, processing, storage, and shipment instructions and contact information will be provided to the investigator site prior to initiation of the study . The total blood sampling volume for individual participant s in this study is approximately up to: 515 mL for participants in Phase 1, 110 mL for Phase 2/ 3 participants 16 years of age , and 50 mL for participants in the 12 - to 15-year age stratum . Additionally , 20 mL of blood for participants 16 years of age and 10 mL for participants in the 12 - to 15-year age stratum will be taken at an unplanned convalescent visit at any time a parti cipant develops respiratory symptoms indicating a potential COVID -19 infection . Select participants in Phase 1 will also be asked to provide an additional blood sample of approximately 170 mL at either Visit 5, 6, or 7. These participants would therefore have a total blood sampling volume of 700 mL during the 24 -month study period . Other a dditional blood samples may be taken for safety assessments at times specified by Pfizer, provided the total volume taken during the study does not exceed 550 mL during any period of 60 consecutive days. 8.1. Efficacy and/or Immunogenicity Assessments Efficacy will be assessed throughout a participant's involvement in the study through surveillance for potential cases of COVID -19. If, at any time, a participant develops acute respiratory illness ( see Section 8.13), for the purposes of the study he or she will be consider ed to potentially have COVID -19 illness.9 In this circumstance, the participant should contact th e site , an in-person or telehealth visit should occur , and a ssessments should be conduct ed as specified in the SoA. The assessments will include a nasal (midturbinate) swab , which will be tested at a central laboratory using a reverse transcription -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test (Cepheid; FDA approved under EUA), or other equivalent nucleic acid amplification -based test (ie, NAAT) , to detect SARS -CoV -2. In addition, clinical information and results from local standard -of-care tests (as detailed in Section 8.13) will be assessed . The central laboratory NAAT result will be used for the case definition, unless no result is available from the central laboratory, in which case a local NAAT result may be used if it was obtained using 1 of the following assays : Cepheid Xpert Xpress SARS -CoV Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 56 Roche cobas SARS -CoV real-time , and SARS -CoV -2-related severe cases , will be considered (for both , the onset date of the case will be the date that symptoms were first experienced by the participant ; if new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previo us symptoms, they will be considered as part of a single illness ): Confirmed COVID -19: presence of at least 1 of the following symptom s and SARS -CoV -2 NAAT -positive during, or within 4 days before or after, the symptomatic period , either at the central lab oratory or at a local testing facility (using an acceptable test): Fever; New or increased cough; New or increased shortness of breath; Chills; New or increased muscle pain; New loss of taste or smell; Sore throat ; Diarrhea; Vomiting . The second definition, which may be updated as more is learn ed about COVID -19, will include the following additional symptoms defined by the CDC ( listed at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019 -ncov/symptoms -testing/symptoms.html) . Confirmed severe COVID -19: confirmed COVID -19 and presence of at least 1 of the following: PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 57 Clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (RR 30 breaths per minute, HR 125 beats per minute, SpO 2 93% on room air at se a level, or PaO 2/FiO 2 <300 mm Hg); Respiratory failure (defined as needing high -flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO); Evidence of shock (SBP <90 mm Hg, DBP <60 mm Hg, or requiring vasopressors); Significant acute renal, he patic, or neurologic dysfunction *; Admission to an ICU; Death. The DMC may recommend modification of the definition of severe disease according to emerging information. * Three blinded case reviewers ( medically qualified Pfizer staff members ) will review all potential COVID -19 illness events . If a NAAT -confirmed case in Phase 2/ 3 may be considered severe, or not, solely on the basis of this criterion, the blinded data will be reviewed by the case reviewers to assess whether the criterion is met; th e majority opinion will prevail. In addition, a serological definition will be used for participants without clinical presentation of COVID -19: Confirmed seroconversion to SARS -CoV -2 without confirmed COVID -19: positive N-binding antibody result in a participant with a prior negative N -binding antibody result Serum samples will be obtained for i mmunogenicity testing at the visits specified in the SoA. The following assays will be performed: Note that all immunogenicity analyses will be based upon samples analyzed at the central laboratory; the rapid test will only be performed at screening by all sites recruiting participants in Phase 1 (see Section 8.11.1.1 ) to determine eligibility. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 58 Serum obtained from the additional ~170 -mL blood sample from select participants in Phase 1 at either Visit 5, 6, or 7 will be used for exploratory COVID -19 resea rch, intended to establish a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. 8.1.1. Biological Samples Blood and nasal swab samples will be used only for scientific research. Each sample will be labeled with a code so that the laborator y personnel testing the samples will not know the participant's identity. Samples that remain after performing assays outlined in the protocol may be stored by Pfizer. Unless a time limitation is required by local regulations or ethical requirements, the samples will be stored for up to 15 years after the end of the study and then destroyed. If allowed by the ICD, stored samples may be used for additional testing to better understand the immune responses to the vaccine(s) under study in this protocol, to inform the development of other products, and/or for vaccine -related assay work supporting vaccine programs. No testing of the participant's DNA will be performed. The participant may request that his or her samples, if still identifiable, be destroyed at any time; however, any data already collected from those samples will still be used for this research. The biological samples may be shared with other researchers as long as confidentiality is maintained and no testing of the participant's DNA is performed . 8.2. Safety Assessments Planned time points for all safety assessments are provided in the SoA. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues . A clinical assessment, including medical history, will be performed on all participant s at his/her first visit to establish a baseline. Significant medical history and observations from any physical examination , if performed, will be documented in the CRF. AEs and SAEs are collected, recorded, and reported as defined in Section 8.3. Acute reactions within the first 4 hours after administration of the study intervention (for the first 5 participants vaccinated in each Phase 1 group), and within the first 30 minutes (for the remainder of participants), will be assessed and documented in the AE CRF. The safety parameters also include reactogenicity e-diary reports of local reactions and systemic events (including fever) , and use of antipyretic medication that occur in the 7 days after administration of the study intervention in a subset of participants . These prospectively self-collected occurrences of local reactions and systemic events are graded as described in Section 8.2.2 . For participants who are not in the reactogenicity subset, these local reactions and systemic events should be detected and reported as AEs, in accordance with Section 8.3.2 . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 59 8.2.1. Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments (Phase 1 Participants Only) See Appendix 2 for the list of clinical safety laboratory tests to be performed and the SoA for the timing and frequency. All protocol -required laboratory assessments, as defined in Appendix 2 , must be conducted in accordance with the laboratory manual and the SoA. Unscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues . The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the CRF. See Appendix 2 for the grading scale for assessment of clinically sig nificant abnormal laboratory findings. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation in the study or within 28 days after the last dose of study intervention should be repeated until the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer con sidered clinically significant by the investigator or medical monitor. If such values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor notified. See Appendix 5 for suggested actions and follow -up assessments in the event of potential drug-induced liver injury (DILI) . 8.2.2. Electronic Diary Participants will be required to complete a reactogenicity e-diary through an application (see Section 8.14) installed on a provisioned device or on the participant's own personal device. All participant s in Phase 1, and a subset of at least the first 6000 randomized in Phase 2/ 3, will be asked to monitor and record local reactions, systemic events, and antipyretic medication usage for 7 days following administration of the study intervention. All participants in Phase 3 who are HIV -positive or 12 to 15 years of age will be included in this subset . In addition, participants 16 through 17 years of age enrolled under protocol amendment 9 a nd onwards will be included in the reactogenicity subset . The reactogenicity e-diary allows recording of these assessments only within a fixed time window, thus providing the accurate representation of the participant 's experience at that time. Data on local reactions and systemic events reported in the reactogenicity e-diary will be transferred electronically to a third -party vendor, where they will be available for review by investigators and the Pfizer clinicians at all times via an internet -based port al. At intervals agreed to by the vendor and Pfizer, these data will be transferred electronically into Pfizer's database for analysis and reporting. These data do not need to be reported by the investigator in the CRF as AEs. Investigators (or designee) will be required to review the reactogenicity e-diary data online at frequent intervals as part of the ongoing safety review. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 60 The investigator or designee must obtain stop dates from the participant for any ongoing local reactions , systemic events , or use of antipyretic medication on the last day that the reactogenicity e-diary was completed. The stop dates should be documented in the source documents and the information entered in the CRF. 8.2.2.1. Grading Scales The grading scales used in this study to assess lo cal reactions and systemic events as described below are derived from the FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) guidelines on toxicity grading scales for healthy adult volunteers enrolled in preventive vaccine clinical trials.8 8.2.2.2. Local Reactions During the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period, participant s will be asked to assess redness, swelling, and pain at the injection site and to record the symptoms in the reactogenicity e-diary. If a local reaction persists beyond the end of the reactogenicity e-diary period following vaccination, the participant will be requested to report that information. The investigator will enter this additional information in the CRF. Redness and swelling will be measured and recorded in measuring device units (range: 1 to 21) and then categorized during analysis as absent, mild, moderate, or severe based on the grading scale in Table 1. Measuring device units can be converted to centimeters according to the following for mula: 1 measuring device unit = 0.5 cm. Pain at the injection site will be assessed by the participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according the grading scale in Table 1. If a Grade 3 local reaction is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated. Only an investigator or medicall y qualified person is able to classify a participant 's local reaction as Grade 4. If a participant experiences a confirmed Grade 4 local reaction , the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administr ation of the study intervention , further vaccinations will b e discontinued in that participant. Table 1. Local Reaction Grading Scale Mild (Grade 1) Moderate (Grade 2) Severe (Grade 3) Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4) Pain at the injection site Does not interfere with activity Interferes with activity Prevents daily activity Emergency room visit or hospitalization for severe pain Redness >2.0 cm to 5.0 cm (5 to 10 measuring device units) >5.0 cm to 10.0 cm (11 to 20 measuring device units) >10 cm (21 measuring device units) Necrosis or exfoliative dermatitis Swelling >2.0 cm to 5.0 cm (5 to 10 measuring device units) >5.0 cm to 10.0 cm (11 to 20 measuring device units) >10 cm (21 measuring device units) Necrosis PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 61 8.2.2.3. Systemic Events During the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period, participant s will be asked to assess vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, chills, new or worsen ed muscle pain, and new or worsen ed joint pain and to record the symptoms in the reactogenicity e-diary. The symptoms will be assessed by the participant as absent, mild, moderate, or severe according to the grading scale in Table 2. If a Grade 3 systemic event is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site vi sit is clinically indicated. Only an investigator or medically qualified person is able to cla ssify a participant's systemic event as Grade 4. If a participant experiences a confirmed Grade 4 systemic event , the investigator must immediately notify the s ponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the administration of the study intervention , further vaccinations will b e discontinued in that participant. Table 2. Systemic Event Grading Scale Mild (Grade 1) Moderate (Grade 2) Severe (Grade 3) Potentially Life Threatening (Grade 4) Vomiting 1-2 times in 24 hours >2 times in 24 hours Requires IV hydration Emergency room visit or hospitalization for hypotensive shock Diarrhea 2 to 3 loose stools in 24 hours 4 to 5 loose stools in 24 hours 6 or more loose stools in 24 hours Emergency room visit or hospitalization for severe diarrhea Headache Does not interfere with activity Some interference with activity Prevents daily routine activity Emergency room visit or hospitalization for severe headache Fatigue/ tiredness Does not interfere with activity Some interference with activity Prevents daily routine activity Emergency room visit or hospitalization for severe fatigue Chills Does not interfere with activity Some interference with activity Prevents daily routine activity Emergency room visit or hospitalization for severe chills New or worsen ed muscle pain Does not interfere with activity Some interference with activity Prevents daily routine activity Emergency room visit or hospitalization for severe new or worsen ed muscle pain New or worsen ed joint pain Does not interfere with activity Some interference with activity Prevents daily routine activity Emergency room visit or hospitalization for severe new or worsen ed joint pain Abbreviation: IV = intravenous. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 62 8.2.2.4. Fever In order to record information on fever, a thermometer will be given to participants with instructions on how to measure oral temperature at home. Temperature will be collected in the reactogenicity e-diary in the evening daily during the reactogenicity e-diary reporting period. It will also be collected at any time during the reactogenicity e-diary data collection periods when fever is suspected. Fever is defined as an oral temperature of 38.0\u00b0C (100.4 \u00b0F). The highest temperature for each day will be recorded in the reactogenicity e-diary. Temperature will be measured and recorded to 1 decimal place and then categorized during analysis according to the scale shown in Table 3. If a fever of 39.0\u00b0C (102.1 \u00b0F) is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact should occur to ascertain further details and determine whether a site visit is clinically indicated. Only an investigator or medi cally qualified person is able to c onfirm a participant's fever as >40.0 \u00b0C (>104.0 \u00b0F). a confirmed fever >40.0 \u00b0C (>104.0 \u00b0F), the investigator must immediately notify the sponsor and, if it is determined to be related to the ad ministration of the study intervention , further vaccinations will be discontinued in that participant. Table 3. Scale for Fever of antipyretic medication to treat symptoms associated with study intervention administration will be recorded in the reactogenicity e-diary daily during the reporting period (Day 1 to Day 7). 8.2.3. Phase 1 Stopping Ru les The following stopping rules are in place for all Phase 1 participant s, based on review of AE data and e -diary reactogenicity data , until the start of Phase 2/3 or 30 days after the last dose of study intervention in Phase 1 , whichever is later . These data will be monitored on an ongoing basis by the investigator (or medically qualified designee) and sponsor in order to promptly identify and flag any event that potentially contributes to a stopping rule. The sponsor study team will be unblinded du ring Phase 1, so will be able to assess whether or not a stopping rule has been met on the basis of a participant 's individual study intervention allocation. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 63 In the event that sponsor personnel confirm that a stopping rule is met, the following actions will commence: The IRC will review all appropriate data. The stopping rule will PAUSE randomization and study intervention administration for the impacted vaccine candidate all dose levels and age groups . The DMC will review all appropriate data . For all participant s vaccinated, all other routine study conduct activities, including ongoing data entry, reporting of AEs, participant reactogenicity e-diary completion, blood sample collection, and participant follow -up, will continue during the pause. A stopping r ule is met if any of the following rules occur after administration of investigational BNT162 vaccine ; data from placebo recipients will not contribute to the stopping rules . Reactogenicity e -diary data confirmed by the investigator as being entered by the participant in error will not contribute toward a stopping rule. The BNT 162b RNA platform will be evaluated for contribution to stopping rules overall ; vaccine candidate dose levels within the platform and age groups will contribute to stopping rules together . However, it is possible that the recommendations may include halting or continuing randomization with any of the BNT162 vaccine candidates . Stopping Rule C riteria for Each BNT162 Vaccine Candidate : 1. If any participant vaccinated with the BNT162 candidate (at any dose level) develops an SAE that is assessed by the investigator as possibly related, or for which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause. 2. If any participant vaccinated with the BNT162 candidate (at any dose level) develops a Grade 4 local reaction or systemic event after vaccination (see Section 8.2.2 ) that is assessed as possibly related by the investigator, or for which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause. 3. If any participant vaccinated with the BNT162 candidate (at any dose level) develops a fever >40.0 \u00b0C (>104.0 \u00b0F) for at least 1 daily measurement after vaccination (see Section 8.2.2.4 ) that is assessed as possibly related by the investigator, or for which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause. 4. If any 2 participants vaccinated with the BNT162 candidate (at any dose level) report the same or similar severe (Grade 3) AE (including laboratory abnormalities) after vaccination, assessed as possibly related by the investigator, or f or which there is no alternative, plausible, attributable cause. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 64 5. If any participant dies or requires ICU admission due to SARS -CoV -2 infection; if this stopping rule is met, all available clinical and preclinical safety and immunogenicity data should be re viewed to evaluate for enhanced COVID -19. 8.2.4. Surveillance of Events That Could Represent Enhanced COVID -19 and Phase 2/3 Stopping Rule Participants in all phases of the study will be surveilled for potential COVID -19 illness from Visit 1 onwards (see Section 8.13). As this is a sponsor open -label study during Phase 1 , the sponsor will conduct unblinded reviews of the data during the course of the study , including for the purpose of safety assessment . All NAAT -confirmed cases in Phase 1 will be reviewed contemporaneously by the IRC and the DMC ( see Section 9.6). In Phase 2/3, the unblinded team supporting the DMC , including an unblinded medical monitor, will review cases of severe COVID -19 as they are received and will review AEs at least weekly for additional potential cases of severe COVID -19. At any point , the unblinded team m ay discuss with the DMC chair whether the DMC should review cases for an adverse imbalance of cases of COVID -19 and/or severe COVID -19 between the vaccine and placebo groups. The purpose of these reviews will be to identify whether any features of each case appear unusual, in particular greater in severity, compared to available information at the time of review. Indicators of severity may include accelerated deterioration, need for hospitalization, need for ventilation, or death. Observed rates of the se indicators will be compared with what could be expected in a similar population to the study participants based upon available information at the time of review. Stopping and alert rules will be applied as follows. The stopping rule will be triggered when the 1-sided probability of observing the same or a more extreme case split is 5% or less when the true incidence of severe disease is the same for vaccine and placebo participants, and alert criteria are triggered when this probability is less than 11% . In addition, when the total number of severe cases is low (15 or less), the unblinded team supporting the DMC will implement the alert rule when a reverse case split of 2:1 or worse is observed. For example, at 3 cases 2:1, at 4 cases 3:1, etc. Below 15 cases, this rule is more rigorous than requiring the probability of an observed adverse split or worse be <11%. Further details can be found in Section 10.7 . 8.2.5. Randomization and Vaccination After a Stopping Rule Is Met Once the IRC (if in Phase 1) and DMC (all phases) have reviewed the safety data and provided guidance, a notification will be sent from the sponsor to the sites with guidance on how to proceed. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 65 8.2.6. Pregnancy Testing Pregnancy tests may be urine or serum tests, but must have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL. Pregnancy tests will be performed in WOCBP at the times listed in the SoA, immediately before the administration of each vaccine dose. A negative pregnancy test result will be required prior to the participant's receiving the study intervention . Pregnancy tests may also be repeated if requested by IRBs/ECs or if required by lo cal regulations. In the case of a positive confirmed pregnancy, the participant will be withdrawn from administration of study intervention but may remain in the study. 8.3. Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events The definitions of an AE and an SAE can be f ound in Appendix 3 . AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, or the participant's parent(s)/legal guardian ). The investigator and any qualified designees are responsi ble for detecting, documenting, and recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible to pursue and obtain adequate information both to determine the outcome and to assess whether the event meets the criteria for classificati on as an SAE or caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section 7.1). Each participan t/parent (s)/legal guardian will be questioned about the occurrence of AEs in a nonleading manner. In addition, the investigator may be requested by Pfizer Safety to obtain specific follow -up information in an expedited fashion. 8.3.1. Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information The time period for actively eliciting and collecting AEs and SAEs (\"active collection period\") for each participant begins from the time the participant /parent(s)/legal guardian provides info rmed consent, which is obtained before the participant 's participation in the study (ie, before undergoing any study -related procedure and/or receiving study intervention ), through and including Visit 7 for Phase 1 participants, and Visit 3 for Phase 2/3 participants . In addition, any AEs occurring up to 48 hours after each subsequent blood draw must be recorded on the CRF. SAEs will be collected from the time the participant /parent(s)/legal guardian provides inform ed consent to approximately 6 months after the last dose of study intervention (Visit 8 for Phase 1 participants, and Visit 4 for Phase 2/ 3 participants). Follow -up by the investigator continues throughout and after the active collection period and until t he AE or SAE or its sequelae resolve or stabilize at a level acceptable to the investigator and Pfizer concurs with that assessment. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 66 For participants who are screen failures, the active collection period ends when screen failure status is determined. If the participant withdraws from the study and also withdraws consent for the collection of future information, the active collection period ends when consent is withdrawn. If a participant definitively discontinues or temporarily discontinues study interven tion because of an AE or SAE, the AE or SAE must be recorded on the CRF and the SAE reported using the Vaccine SAE Report Form. Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE s or SAE s after the participant has concluded study participation . However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a participant has completed the study, and he/she considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention, the investigator must promptly report the SAE to Pfizer us ing the Vaccine SAE Report Form . 8.3.1.1. Reporting SAEs to Pfizer Safety All SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period as described in Section 8.3.1 are reported to Pfizer Safety on the Vaccine SAE Report Form i mmediately upon awareness and under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours, as indicated in Appendix 3 . The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of it being available. 8.3.1.2. Recording Nonserious AEs and SAEs on the CRF All nonserious AEs and SAEs occurring in a participant during the active collection period , which begins after obtaining informed consent as described in Section 8.3.1 , will be recorded on the AE section o f the CRF. The investigator is to record on the CRF all directly observed and all spontaneously reported AEs and SAEs reported by the participant. 8.3.2. Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE s and SAE s and the procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Appendix 3 . Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open -ended and nonleading verbal questioning of t he participant is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences. 8.3.3. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each participant at subsequent visits/contacts. For each event, the inves tigator must pursue and obtain adequate information until resolution, stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -up (as defined in Section 7.3). PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 67 In general, follow -up information will include a description of the event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Any information relevant to the event, such as concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a participant death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to Pfizer Safety . Further information on follow -up procedures is given in Appendix 3 . 8.3.4. Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a n SAE is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study i ntervention under clinical investigation are met. The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The sponsor will co mply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRBs/ECs, and investigators. Investigator safety reports must be prepared for SUSAR s according to local regulatory requirements and sponsor policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary. An investigator who receives SUSAR s or other specific safety information (eg, summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file it along with the SRSD (s) for the study and will notify the IRB/EC, if appropriate according to local requirements. 8.3.5. Exposure During Pregnancy or Breastfeeding, and Occupational Exposure Exposure to the study interventio n under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding and occupational exposure are reportable to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of investigator awareness. 8.3.5.1. Exposure During Pregnancy An EDP occurs if: A female participant is found to be pregnant while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention . A male participant who is receiving or has discontinued study intervention exposes a female partner prior to or around the time of conception . A female is found to be pregnant while being exposed or having been exposed to study interve ntion due to environmental exposure. Below are examples of environmental exposure during pregnancy: A female family member or healthcare provider reports that she is pregnant after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin conta ct. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 68 A male family member or healthcare provider who has been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact then exposes his female partner prior to or around the time of conception . The investigator must report EDP to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator's awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The initial information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to termination of pregnancy). If EDP occurs in a participant or a participant's partner, the investigator must report this information to Pfizer Safety on the Vaccine SAE Report Form and an EDP Supplemental Form, regardless of whether an SAE has occurred. Details of the pregnancy will be collected after the start of study intervention and until 6 months after the last dose of study intervention. If EDP occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the investigator must report information to Pfizer Safety using the Vaccine SAE Report Form and EDP Supplemental Form. Since the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. Follow -up is conducted to obtain general information on the pregnancy and its outcome for all EDP reports with an unknown outcome. The investigator will follow the pregnancy until completion (or until pregnancy termination) and notify Pfizer S afety of the outcome as a follow -up to the initial EDP Supplemental Form. In the case of a live birth, the structural integrity of the neonate can be assessed at the time of birth. In the event of a termination, the reason(s) for termination should be sp ecified and, if clinically possible, the structural integrity of the terminated fetus should be assessed by gross visual inspection (unless preprocedure test findings are conclusive for a congenital anomaly and the findings are reported). Abnormal pregnanc y outcomes are considered SAEs. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for an SAE (ie, ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly ), the investigator should follow the procedures for reporting SAEs. Additional information about pregnancy outcomes that are reported to Pfizer Safety as SAEs follows: Spontaneous abortion includ ing miscarriage and missed abortion; Neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, without regard to causality, as SAEs. In addition, infant deaths after 1 month should be reported as SAEs when the investigator assesses the infant death as related or possibly related to exposure to the study intervention. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 69 Additional information regarding the EDP may be requested by the sponsor. Further follow -up of birth outcomes will be handled on a case -by-case basis (eg, follow -up on preterm infants to identify developmental delay s). In the case of paternal exposure, the investigator will provide the participant with the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to deliver to his partner. The investigator must document in the source documents that the participant was given the Pregnant Partner Release of Information Form to provide to his partner. 8.3.5.2. Exposure During Breastfeeding An exposure during breastfeeding occurs if: A female participant is found to be breastfeeding while receiving or after discontinuing study intervention . A female is found to be breastfeeding while being exposed or having been exposed to study intervention (ie, environmental exposure). An example of environmental exposure during breastfeeding is a female family member or healthcare provider who reports th at she is breastfeeding after having been exposed to the study intervention by inhalation or skin contact. The investigator must report exposure during breastfeeding to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator's awareness, irrespective of whether an SAE has occurred. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Report Form. When exposure during breastfeeding occurs in the setting of environmental exposure, the exposure information does not pertain to the participant enrolled in the stud y, so the information is not recorded on a CRF. However, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file. An exposure during breastfeeding report is not created when a Pfizer drug specifically approved for use i n breastfeeding women (eg, vitamins) is administered in accord with authorized use. However, if the infant experiences an SAE associated with such a drug, the SAE is reported together with the exposure during breastfeeding. 8.3.5.3. Occupational Exposure An occupa tional exposure occurs when a person receives unplanned direct contact with the study intervention , which may or may not lead to the occurrence of an AE. Such persons may include healthcare providers , family members, and other roles that are involved in t he trial participant's care. The investigator must report occupational exposure to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of the investigator's awareness, regardless of whether there is an associated SAE. The information must be reported using the Vaccine SAE Repo rt Form. Since the information does not pertain to a participant enrolled in the study, the information is not recorded on a CRF; however, a copy of the completed Vaccine SAE Report Form is maintained in the investigator site file . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 70 8.3.6. Cardiovascular and Death Events Not applicable . 8.3.7. Disease -Related Events and/or Disease -Related Outcomes Not Qualifying as AEs or SAEs Potential COVID -19 illnesses and their sequelae that are consistent with the clinical endpoint definition should not be recorded as AEs. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only on the relevant pages of the CRF , as these are expected endpoints. Potential COVID -19 illness es and their sequ elae will not be reported according to the standard process for expedited reporting of SAEs , even though the event may meet the definition of an SA E. These events will be recorded on the COVID -19 illness page s in the participant's CRF within 1 day . NOTE: However, if either of the following conditions applies, then the event must be recorded and reported as an SAE (instead of a disease -related event ): The event is, in the investigator's opinion, of greater intensity, frequency, or duration than expected for the individual participant. OR The investigator considers that there is a reasonable possibility that the event was related to study intervention . Potential COVID -19 illness events and their sequelae will be reviewed by a group of internal blinded case reviewers . Any SAE that is determined by the internal case reviewers NOT to meet endpoint criteria is reported back to the investigator site of inc idence. The investigator must report the SAE to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours of being made aware that the SAE did not meet endpoint criteria. The investigator's SAE awareness date is the date on which the investigator site of incidence receives the SAE back from the internal case reviewers . 8.3.8. Adverse Events of Special Interest Not applicable . 8.3.8.1. Lack of Efficacy Lack of efficacy is reportable to Pfizer Safety only if associated with an SAE. 8.3.9. Medical Device Deficiencies Not applicable . 8.3.10. Medication Errors Medicat ion errors may result from the administration or consumption of the study intervention by the wrong participant , or at the wrong time, or at the wrong dosage strength . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 71 Exposures to the study intervention under study may occur in clinical trial settings, such as medication errors. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the Vaccine SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness Medication errors All (regardless of whether associated with an AE) Only if associated with an SAE Medication errors include: Medication errors involving participant exposure to the study intervention ; Potential medication errors or uses outside of what is foreseen in the protocol that do or do not involve the study participant ; The administration of expired study intervention; The administration of an incorrect study intervention; The administration of an incorrect dosage; The administration of study intervention that has undergone temperature excu rsion from the specified storage range, unless it is determined by the sponsor that the study intervention under question is acceptable for use. Such medication errors occurring to a study participant are to be captured on the medication error page of the CRF, which is a specific version of the AE page. In the event of a medication dosing error, the sponsor should be notified within 24 hours . Whether or not the medication error is accompanied by an AE, as determined by the investigator, the medication error is recorded on the medication error page of the CRF and, if applicable, any associated AE(s), serious and nonserious, are recorded on the AE page of the CRF. Medication errors should be reported to Pfizer Safety within 24 hours on a Vaccine SAE Report Form only when associated with an SAE. 8.4. Treatment of Overdose For this study, any dose of study intervention greater than 1 dose of study intervention within a 24-hour time period will be considered an overdose. Pfizer does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 72 In the event of an overdose, the investigator should: 1. Contact the medical monitor within 24 hours . 2. Closely monitor the p articip ant for any AEs/SAEs . 3. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdose in the CRF. 4. Overdose is reportable to Safety only when associated with a n SAE. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be mad e by the investigator in consultation with the medical monitor based on the clinical evaluation of the participant. 8.5. Pharmacokinetics Pharmacokinetic parameters are not evaluated in this study. 8.6. Pharmacodynamics Pharmacodynamic parameters are not evaluated in this study. 8.7. Genetics Genetics (specified analyses) are not evaluated in this study. 8.8. Biomarkers Biomarkers are not evaluated in this study. 8.9. Immunogenicity Assessments Immunogenicity assessments are described in Section 8.1. 8.10. Health Economics Health economics/ medical resource utilization and health economics parameters are not evaluated in this study. 8.11. Study Procedures 8.11.1. Phase 1 8.11.1.1. Screening : (0 to 28 Days Before Visit 1 ) Before enrollment and before any study -related procedures are performed, voluntary, written study -specific informed consent will be obtained from the participant . Each signature on the ICD must be personall y dated by the signatory. The investigator or his or her designee will also sign the ICD. A copy of the signed and dated ICD must be given to the participant . The source data must reflect that the informed consent was obtained before participation in the study. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 73 It is anticipated that the procedures below will be conducted in a stepwise manner ; however, the visit can occur over more than 1 day . Assign a single participant number using the IRT system. Obtain the participant 's demography (including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity). The full date of birth will be collected to critically evaluate the immune response and safety profile by age. Obtain any medical history of clinical significance. Obtain details of any medications curr ently taken. Perform physical examination including vital signs (weight, height, body temperature, pulse rate, and seated blood pressure), evaluating any clinically significant abnormalities within the following body systems: general appearance; skin; head musculoskeletal; extremities; neurological; and lymph nodes. Collect a blood sample (approximately 20 mL) for potential future serological assessment and to perform a rapid test for prior COVID -19 infe ction. Collect a blood sample (approximately 10 mL) for hematology and chemistry laboratory tests as described in Section 10.2. Collect a blood sample (approximately 10 mL) for HIV, HBsAg, HBc Ab, and HCV Ab tests. Perform urine pregnancy test on WOCBP as described in Section 8.2.6 . Discuss contraceptive use as described in Section 10.4. Record nonstudy vaccinations as described in Section 6.5. Ensure and document that all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are met. Record AEs as described in Section 8.3. AEs that occur prior to dosing should be noted on the Medical History CRF. Ask the participant to contact the site staff or investigator immediately if any significant illness or hospitalization occurs. Ask the participant to contact the site staff or investigator immediately if he or she experience s any respiratory symptoms as detailed in Section 8.13. Schedule an appointment for the participant to return for the next study visit. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 74 Complete the source documents . Complete the CRF. 8.11.1.2.

Unscheduled Visit for a Grade 3 or Suspected Grade 4 Reaction If a Grade 3 local reaction ( Section 8.2.2.2 ), systemic event ( Section 8.2.2.3 ), 8.2.2.4 ) is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact should occur to ascertain further details and dete rmine whether a site visit is clinically indicated. If suspected Grade 4 local reaction ( Section 8.2.2.2 ), systemic event ( Section 8.2.2.3 ), 8.2.2.4 ) is reported in the reactogenicity e-diary, a telephone contact or site visit should occur to confirm whether the event meets the criteria for Grade 4. A site visit must be scheduled as soon as possible to assess the participant unless any of the following is true: The participant is unable to attend the unscheduled visit. The local reaction/systemic event is no longer present at the time of the telephone contact. The participant or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian , as appropriate , recorded an incorrect value in the reactogenicity e-diary (confirmation of a reactogenicity e-diary data entry error). PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 93 The PI or authorized designee determined it was not needed. This telephone contact will be reco rded in the participant 's source documentation and the CRF. If the participant is unable to attend the unscheduled visit, or the PI or authorized designee determined it was not needed, any ongoing local reactions /systemic events must be assessed at the nex t study visit. During the unscheduled visit, the reactions should be assessed by the investigator or a medically qualified member of the study staff such as a study physician or a study nurse, as applicable to the investigator's local practice, who will: Measure body temperature ( \u00b0F/\u00b0C). Measure minimum and maximum diameters of redness (if present). Measure minimum and maximum diameters of swelling (if present). Assess injection site pain (if present) in accordance with the grades provided in Section 8.2.2.2 . Assess systemic events (if present) in accordance with the grades provided in Section 8.2.2.3 . Assess for other findings associated with the reaction and r ecord on the AE page of the CRF, if appropriate. The investigator or an authorized designee will complete the unscheduled visit assessment page of the CRF. 8.13. COVID -19 Surveillance (All Participants) If a participant experiences any of the following (irrespective of perceived etiology or clinical significance ), he or she is instructed to contact the site immediately and, if confirmed , participate in a n in-person or telehealth visit as soon as possible , optimally within 3 days of symptom onset (and at the latest 4 days after symptom resolution ). Note that : If new symptoms are reported within 4 days after resolution of all previous symptoms, they will be considered as part of a single illness and a second illness visit is not re quired ; Surveillance of potential COVID -19 symptoms should continue even if a participant has a positive SARS -CoV -2 test earlier in the study . During the 7 days following each vaccination, potential COVID -19 symptoms that overlap with specific systemic eve nts (ie , fever, chills, new or increased muscle pain, diarrhea, vomiting) should not trigger a potential COVID -19 illness visit unless, in the investigator's PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 94 opinion, the clinical picture is more indicative of a possible COVID -19 illness than vaccine reactogenicity. If, in the investigator's opinion, the symptoms are considered more likely to be vaccine reactogenicity, but a participant is required to demonstrate that they are SARS -CoV -2-negative, a local SARS -CoV -2 test may be performed: if positive, the symptoms should be recorded as a potential COVID -19 illness ; if not, the symptoms should be recorded as AEs (unless already captured in the reactogenicity e -diary) . Participants may utilize a COVID -19 illness e -diary through an application (se e Section 8.14) installed on a provisioned device or on the participant's own personal device to prompt him/her to r eport any symptoms. Note that this does not substitute for a participant's routine medical care. Therefore , participants should be encouraged to seek care, if appropriate, from their usual provider.

Potential COVID -19 Illness Visit : (Optimally Within 3 Days After Potential COVID -19 Illness Onset ) This visit may be conducted as an in -person or telehealth visit; a telehealth visit involve s the sharing of healthcare information and servi ces via telecommunication technologies (eg, audio, video, video -conferencing software) remotely , thus allowing the participant and investigator to communicate on aspects of clinical care. As a participant's COVID -19 illness may evolve over time, several contacts may be required to obtain the following information: Record AEs , as appropriate as described in Section 8.3. Note: Potential COVID -19 illnesses that are consistent with the clinical endpoint definition should not be recorded as AEs. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only on the relevant pages of the CRF, as these ar e expected endpoints. Record details of any of the prohibited medications specified in Section 6.5.1 received by the participant if required for his or her clinical care. If the visit is conducted in person, obtain a nasal (midturbinate) swab (collected by site staff). Alternatively, if c onducted by telehealth, i nstruct the participant to self-collect a nasal (midturbinate) swab and ship for assessment at the central laboratory . Collect COVID -19-related standard -of-care clinical and laboratory information . This includes, but is not limited to: Symptoms and signs, including Clinical signs at rest indicative of severe systemic illness (RR 30 breaths per minute, HR 125 beats per minute, SpO 2 93% on room air at sea level, or PaO 2/FiO 2 <300 mm Hg) Evidence of shock (SBP <90 mm Hg, DBP <60 mm Hg, or requiring vasopressors) Significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction Respiratory failure (defined as needing high -flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation, or ECMO) Clinical diagnosis Local laboratory SARS-CoV -2 test result (s). Note that if it is routine practice to perform a repeat local SARS -CoV -2 test for any reason, then a repeat nasal (midturbinate) swab should also be obtained and shipped for assessment at the central laboratory . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 96 Full blood count Blood chemistry, specifically creatinine, urea, liver function tests , and C-reactive protein Imaging results (eg , CT or MRI scan) to document neurologic dysfunction Number and type of any healthcare contact; duration of hospitalization and ICU stay Death Schedule an appointment for the participant to return for the potential COVID -19 convalescent visit once he or she has recovered . Complete the source documents. The investigator or an authorized designee completes the CRFs. 8.13.2. Potential COVID -19 Convalescent Visit : (28 to 35 Days After Potential COVID -19 Illness Visit) Record AEs , as appropriate as described in Section 8.3. Note: Potential COVID -19 illnesses that are consistent with the clinical endpoint definition should not be recorded as AEs. These data will be captured as efficacy assessment data only on the relevant pages of the CRF, as these are expected endpoints. Record d etails of any of the prohibited medications specified in Section 6.5.1 received by the participant if required for his or her clinical care. Collect a blood sample (approximately 20 mL for participants 16 years of age and approximately 10 mL for participants in the 12 - to 15-year age stratum ) for immunogenicity testing. Collect /update COVID -19-related clinical and laboratory information ( detailed in Section 8.13.1 ). Complete the source documents. The investigator or an authorized designee c ompletes the CRFs. Record any AEs that occur within the 48 hours after the blood draw as described in Section 8.3. 8.14. Communication and Use of Technology In a study of this nature that requires illness events to be reported outside of scheduled study visits, it is vital that communication between the study site and the participant or his/her PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 97 parent(s)/legal guardian , as appropriate , is maintained to ensure that endpoint events are not missed. This study will employ various methods, tailored to the individual participant, to ensure that communication is maintained and study information can be transmitted securely. Using appropriate technology, such as a stu dy application, a communication pathway between the participant or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian , as appropriate , and the study site staff will be established. The participant or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian , as appropriate , may be able to utilize his or her own devices to access this technology, or use a device provided by the sponsor. Traditional methods of telephone communication will also be available. The technology solution may facilitate the following: Contact with the investigator, includi ng the ability of the participant or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian , as appropriate , to report whether or not the participant has experienced symptoms that could represent a potential COVID -19 illness ( COVID -19 illness e -diary; see Section 8.13). An alert in the event that the participant is hospitalized. Visit reminders. Messages of thanks and encouragement from the study team. A platform for recording local reactions and systemic events ( reactogenicity e-diary) - see Section 8.2.2 . If a participant or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian , as appropriate , is not actively completing either the reacto genicity or COVID -19 illness e -diary , the investigator or designee is required to contact the participant or his/her parent(s)/legal guardian , as appropriate , to ascertain why and also t o obtain details of any missed events. 8.15. SARS -CoV -2 NAAT Results From Visits 1 and 2 and Potential COVID -19 Illness Visits Nasal (midturbinate) swabs for SARS -CoV -2 NAAT are obtained at: Visits 1 and 2: To determine whether a participant will be included in efficacy analyses of those with no serological or virological evidence (up to 7 or 14 days after receipt of the second dose, depending on the objective ) of past SARS -CoV -2 infection . Potential COVID -19 illness visits: To determine whether symptoms experien ced by the participant fulfil l the COVID -19 case definition. Research laboratory -generated p ositive result s from the Visit 1 and Visit 2 swab s, and all results from the illness visit swabs, will be provided to the site once available, but this will not be in real time and cannot be relied upon to direct clinical care. Therefore, the participant should be directed to seek additional testing through his/her primary healthcare providers at a licensed clinical laboratory when exhibiting potential COVID -19 symptoms or otherwise PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 98 receiving a positive result and counseled on whether to take any precautionary measures pending confirmatory testing . Participants who have a positive SARS -CoV -2 NAAT resu lt prior to Visit 2 should be handled as follows : Positive SARS -CoV -2 test with no symptoms, either at Visit 1 or any time between Visit 1 and Visit 2: A positive test in an asymptomatic participant does not meet exclusion criterion 5; therefore , Vaccinati on 2 should proceed as normal. Confirmed COVID -19 (ie , symptoms and positive SARS -CoV -2 test): This meets exclusion criterion 5; therefore , Vaccination 2 should not be given but the participant should remain in the study. 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Methodo logy for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study is described here and further detailed in a statistical analysis plan (SAP), which will be maintained by the sponsor. The SAP may modify what is outlined in the protocol where appropriate; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definitions or their analyses will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 9.1. Estimands and Statistical Hypotheses 9.1.1. Estimands The estimand corresponding to each primary, secondary , and tertiary/ exploratory objective is described in the table in Section 3. In the primary safety objective evaluations, missing reactogenicity e-diary data will not be imputed. Missing AE dates will be imputed according to Pfizer safety rules. No other missing information will be imputed in the safety analysis. The estimands to evaluate the immunogenicity objectives are based on evaluable populations for immunogenicity (Section 9.3). These estimands estima te the vaccine effect in the hypothetical setting where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. Missing antibody results will not be imputed. Immunogenicity results that are below the LLOQ will be set to 0.5 \u00d7 LLOQ in the analysis ; this may be adjusted once additional data on the assay characteristics become available . The estimands to evaluate the efficacy objectives are based on evaluable populations for efficacy (Section 9.3). These estimands estimate the vaccine effect in the hypothetical setting where participants follow the study schedules and protocol requirements as directed. In addition, VE will also be analyzed by all -available efficacy population . Missing laboratory results will not be imputed for the primary analysis, but missing data imputation for the efficacy endpoint may be perfor med as a sensitivity analysis . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 99 9.1.2. Statistical Hypotheses 9.1.2.1. Statistical Hypothesis Evaluation for Efficacy Phase 2/ 3 of the study has 2 primary efficacy endpoints evaluating VE, which is defined as VE = 100 \u00d7 (1 - IRR). IRR is calculated as the ratio of first confirmed COVID -19 illness rate in the vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group. In Phase 2/ 3, the assessment of VE will be based on posterior probabilities of VE 1 > 30% and VE 2 > 30% . VE 1 represents VE for prophylactic BNT162 b2 against confirmed COVID -19 in participants without evidence of infection before vaccination, and VE 2 represents VE for prophylactic BNT162 b2 against confirmed COVID -19 in all participants after vaccination. For participants with multiple confirmed cases, only the first case will contribute to the VE calculation for each hypothesis. VE 1 and VE 2 will be ev aluated sequentially to control the overall type I error to the desired level of 2.5%. VE is demonstrated if there is sufficient evidence (posterior probability) that either VE 1 >30% or both VE 1 and VE 2 are >30%. The assessment for the primary analysis will be based on posterior probability using a Bayesian model. 9.1.2.2. Statistical Hypothesis Evaluation for Immunogenicity One of the secondary objectives in the Phase 3 part of the study is to evaluate noninferiority of the immune response to prophylact ic BNT162b2 in participants 12 to 15 years of age compared to the response in participants 16 to 25 years of age at 1 month after Dose 2. The (Dose 2) evaluable immunogenicity population will be used for the following hypothesis testing: H0: ln(\u00b5 2) - ln(\u00b5 1) ln(0.67) where margin for noninferiority , ln(\u00b52) and ln(\u00b51) are the natural log of the geometric mean of SA RS-CoV -2 neutralizing titers from BNT162b2 recipients 12 to 15 years of age and 16 to 25 years of age , respec tively, measured 1 month after Dose 2 . If the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GM R (12-15 years of age to 16 -25 years of age) is >0.67, the noninferiority objective is met . 9.2. Sample Size Determination The study sample size for Phase 1 of the study is not based on any statistical hypothesis testing. Phase 1 comprise s 15 participants (randomization ratio of 4:1 so that 12 receive active vaccine and 3 receive placebo) per group; 13 vaccine groups are studied, correspond ing to a total of 195 participants. For Phase 2/ 3, with assumptions of a true VE of 60% after the second dose of investigational product, a total of approximately 164 first confirmed COVID -19 illness cases will provide 90% power to conclude true VE > 30% with high probabilit y, allowing early stopping for efficacy at the IA. This would be achieved with 17,600 evaluable participants per group or 21,999 vaccine recipients randomized in a 1:1 ratio with placebo, for a total sample size of 43,998 , based on the assumption of a 1. 3% illness rate per year in the placebo group, accrual of 164 first primary -endpoint cases within 6 months, and 20% of the participants being PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 100 nonevaluable or having serological evidence of prior infection with SARS -CoV -2, potentially maki ng them immune to further infection . Dependent upon the evolution of the pandemic, it is possible that the COVID -19 attack rate may be much higher, in which case accrual would be expected to be more rapid, enabling the study's primary endpoint to be evalu ated much sooner. The total number of participants enrolled in Phase 2/ 3 may vary depending on the incidence of COVID -19 at the time of the enrollment, the true underlying VE, and a potential early stop for efficacy or futility . In Phase 3, approximately 2000 participants are anticipated to be 12 to 15 years of age. A random sample of 250 participant s will be selected for each of the 2 age group s (12 to 15 years and 16 to 25 years) as an immunogenicity subset for the noninferiority assessment. With the standard deviation and observed GM T difference assumed in the power analysis below, a sample size of 200 evaluable participants (or 250 vaccine recipients) per age group will provide a power of 90.8% to declare the noninferiority of adolescent s to 16- to 25-year-olds in terms of neutralizing antibody GM R, 1 month after the second dose (see Table 4). Table 4. Power Analysis for Noninferiority Assessment Criteria Standard Deviation (Log Value)a Assumed Observed GMT Difference ( Log Scale) Number of Evaluable Participants per Age Group Powerb Lower = geometric mean ratio. a. Reference: 1 month after Dose 2, BNT162b2 (30 \u00b5g), 18- 55-year age group (C4591001 Phase 1 , N=12 ).

For safety outcomes, Table 5 shows the probability of observing at least 1 AE for a given true event rate of a particular AE, for various sample sizes. For example, if the true AE rate is 10%, with 12 participant s in a vaccine group, there is 72% probability of observing at least 1 AE.

Safety All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of the study intervention . 9.4. Statistical Analyses The SAP will be developed and finalized before database lock for any of the planned analyses in Section 9.5.1 . It will describe the participant populations to be included in the analyses and the procedures for accounting for mis sing, unused, and spurious data. This section provides a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the primary, secondary , and tertiary/ exploratory endpoints. 9.4.1. Immunogenicity Analyses Immunogenicity samples will be drawn for all participants . Immunogenicity analyses will be based upon results from appropriately sized subsets of samples, according to the purpose. The statistical analysis of immunogenicity results will be primarily based on the evaluable immunogenicity populations as defined in Section 9.3. Serology data after a postbaseline positive SARS -CoV -2 test result will not be included in the analysis based on the evaluable immunogenicity population s. An additional analysis will be performed based on the all-available populations if there is a large enough difference in sample size between the all-available immunogenicity population and the evaluable immunogenicity popu lation. Participants will be summarized according to the vaccine group to which they were randomized. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 103 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Secondary immunogenicity Geometric mean titers/concentrations 2-sided 95% CIs will be provided for each investigational product within each group before vaccin ation and at each of the following time point s: Phase 1: 7 and 21 days after Dose 1; 7 and 14 days and 1, 6, 12 and 24 months after Dose 2 Geometric means will be calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the logarithm transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two -sided 95% CIs will be obtained by taking natural log transforms of concentrations/titers, calculating the 95% CI with reference to the t -distribution, a nd then exponentiating the confidence and 2-sided 95% CIs will be provided for each investigational product within each group at each of the following time point s: Phase 1: 7 and 21 days after Dose 1; 7 and 14 days and 1, 6, 12 , and 24 months after Dose 2 GMFRs will be limite d to participants with nonmissing values prior to the first dose and at the postvaccination time point . The GMFR will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (later time point - earlier time point) and expo nentiating the mean . The associated 2-sided CIs will be obtained by calculating CIs using Student's t -distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits . Percentage of participants with 4-fold in (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 104 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods participants with 4 -fold rise will be provided for each investigational product within each g roup at each of the following time point s: Phase 1: 7 and 21 days after Dose 1; 7 and 14 days and 1, 6, 12 , and 24 months after Dose 2 The Clopper -Pearson method will be used to calculate the CIs. GMR of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing and 2-sided 95% CIs will be provided for each investigational product within each group at each of the following time point s: Phase 1: 7 and 21 days after Dose 1; 7 and 14 days and 1, 6, 12 , and 24 months after Dose 2 GMRs will be limited to participants with nonmissing values for bo th SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing titers and S1-binding IgG level /RBD - binding IgG level at each time point. The GMR will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (eg, SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing titers S1-bindin g IgG level for each participant) and exponentiating the mean . Two -sided CIs will be obtained by calculating CIs using Student's t -distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidenc e limits . For all the immunogenicity endpoints, the analysis will be based on the Dose 1 and Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity population s. An additional analysis will be performed based on the all -available immunogenicity population s if there is a large e nough difference in sample size between the all -available immunogenicity population s and the evaluable immunogenicity population s. Participants will be summarized according to the vaccine group to which they were randomized. Missing serology data will no t be imputed . Secondary immunogenicity (noninferiority in the 12- to 15-year age group compared to the GMR of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing titers in participants 12 to 15 years of age to those 16 to 25 years of age For participants with no serological or virological evidence (up to 1 month after receipt of the second dose) of past SARS -CoV -2 infection , the GM R of SARS -CoV -2 neutralizing titers in participants 12 to 15 years of age to those in participants 16 to 25 years of age and PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 105 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods 16- to 25-year age group ) 2-sided 95% CIs will be provided at 1 month after Dose 2 for noninferiority assessment. The GM R and its 2 -sided 95% CI will be derived by calculating differences in means and CIs on the natural log scale of the titers based on the Stude nt's t -distribution and then exponentiating the results. The difference in means on the natural log scale will be 12 to 15 years minus 16 to 25 years. N oninferiority will be declared if the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% CI for the GM R is greater than 0. 67. This analysis will be based on Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity populations. An additional analysis may be performed based on the Dose 2 all -available immunogenicity population if need ed. Participants will be summarized according to the vaccine grou p to which they were randomized. Missing serology data will not be imputed. Exploratory immunogenicity 2 -sided 95% CIs will be provided for each investigational product within each group before vaccination and at each of the following time points in Phase 2/3: 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after completion of vaccination in participants with and without serological or virological evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infection before vaccination Geometric means will be calculated as the mean of the assay results after making the loga rithm transformation and then exponentiating the mean to express results on the original scale. Two -sided 95% CIs will be obtained by taking natural log transforms of concentrations/titers, calculating the 95% CI with reference to the t -distribution, and t hen exponentiating the confidence limits. and 2 -sided 95% CIs will be provided for each investigational product within each group at each of the following time points in Phase 2/3: PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 106 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods 1, 6, 12, and 24 months after completion of vaccination in participants with and without serological or virological evidence of SARS -CoV -2 infect ion before vaccination GMFRs will be limited to participants with nonmissing values prior to the first dose and at the postvaccination time point. The GMFR will be calculated as the mean of the difference of logarithmically transformed assay results (late r time point - earlier time point) and exponentiating the mean. The associated 2 -sided CIs will be obtained by calculating CIs using Student's t -distribution for the mean difference of the logarithmically transformed assay results and exponentiating the confidence limits.

Percentage of participants with the immune response (non -S) to SARS -CoV -2 for N -binding antibody at the time points when data are available The Clopper -Pearson method will be used to calculate the CIs. For all of the immunogenicity endpoints, the analysis will be based on the Dose 1 and Dose 2 evaluable immunogenicity populations. An additional analysis will be performed based on the all -available immunogenicity populations if there is a large enough difference in sample size between the all -available immunogenicity populations and the evaluable immunogenicity populations. Participants will be summarized according to the vaccine group to which they were randomized. Missing serology data will not be imputed.

Efficacy Analyses The evaluable efficacy population will be the primary analysis population for all efficacy analyses . Additional analyses based on the all -available efficacy population will be performed . Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary efficacy Ratio of confirmed COVID -19 illness from 7 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants without evidence of infection (prior to 7 days after receipt of the second dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group VE will be estimated by 100 \u00d7 (1 - IRR), wher e IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed COVID -19 illness per 1000 person -years follow -up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group from 7 days after the second dose. VE will be analyzed using a beta-binomial model . After the above objective is met, the second primary endpoint will be evaluated as below. Ratio of confirmed COVID -19 illness from 7 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants with and without evidenc e of infection (prior to 7 days after receipt of the second dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group VE will be estimated by 100 \u00d7 (1 - IRR), where IRR is the calculated ratio of confirmed COVID -19 illness per 1000 person -years follow -up in the active vaccine group to the corresponding illness rate in the placebo group from 7 days after the second dose. VE will be analyzed using a beta -binomial model . The efficacy analysis for the first primary objective evaluation will be based on the participants without evidence of infection before vaccination and included in the evaluable efficacy population and in the all-available efficacy population. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 108 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods The efficacy analysis for the second primary objective evaluation will be based on all participants included in the evaluable efficacy population and in the all -available efficacy population. For the primary endpoint analysis, missing efficacy data will not be imputed. A sensitivity analysis will be performed by imputing missing value s with the assumption of MAR. A missing efficacy endpoint may be imputed based on predicted probability using the fully conditional specification method. Other imputation methods without the MAR assumption may be explored. The details will be provided in the SAP. Secondary First: Ratio of confirmed COVID -19 illness from 14 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants without evidence of infection (prior to 14 days after receipt of the second dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group Second: Ratio of confirmed COVID -19 illness from 14 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants with and without evidence of infection (prior to 14 days after receipt of t he second dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group Third and fourth : Ratio s of confirmed severe COVID -19 illness from 7 days and from 14 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants without evidence of infec tion (prior to 7 days or 14 days after receipt of the second dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group Fifth and sixth: Ratio s of confirmed severe COVID -19 illness from 7 days and from 14 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants with and without evidence of infection (prior to 7 days or 14 days after receipt of the second dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group These secondary efficacy objectives will be evaluated sequentially in the order specified above after the primary objectives are met. The analysis will be based on the evaluable efficacy population and the all - available efficacy population. The analysis methodology used for the primary efficacy endpoints will be applied for the analysis of the above secondary efficacy endpoints . The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be evaluated descriptively with 95% CIs. Ratio s of confirmed COVID -19 illness (according to the CDC-defined symptoms) from 7 days and from 14 days after the PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 109 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants without evidence of infection (prior to 7 days or 14 days after receipt of the seco nd dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group Ratio s of confirmed COVID -19 illness (according to the CDC-defined symptoms) from 7 days and from 14 days after the second dose per 1000 person -years of follow -up in participants with and without evidence of infection (prior to 7 days or 14 days after receipt of the second dose) for the active vaccine group to the placebo group VE = 100 \u00d7 (1 - IRR) will be estimated with confirmed COVID -19 illness according to the CDC -defined symptoms from 7 days or from 14 days after the second dose. The 2 -sided 95% CI for VE will be derived using the Clopper -Pearson method as described by Agresti .9 Missing efficacy data will not be imputed. 9.4.3. Safety Analyses Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods Primary Descriptive statistics will be provided for each reactogenicity endpoint for each dose and vaccine group. Local reactions and systemic events from Day 1 through Day 7 after each vaccination will be presented by severity and cumulatively across severity le vels. Descriptive summary statistics will include counts and percentages of participants with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper -Pearson 95% CIs. For Phase 1, descriptive statistics will be provided for abnormal hematology and chemistry laboratory values at 1 and 7 days after Dose 1 and 7 days after Dose 2, including grading shifts in hematology and chemistry laboratory assessments between baseline and 1 and 7 days after Dose 1, and before Dose 2 and 7 days after Dose 2. Descri ptive summary statistics will include counts and percentages of participants with the indicated endpoint and the associated Clopper -Pearson 2-sided 95% CIs . AEs will be categorized according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) term s. A 3 -tier approach will be used to summarize AEs in Phase 2/3 . Under this approach AEs are classified into 1 of 3 tiers: (1) Tier 1 events are prespecified events of clinical importance and are identified in a list in the product's safety PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 110 Endpoint Statistical Analysis Methods review plan; (2) Tier 2 events are those that are not Tier 1 but are considered \"relatively common\"; a MedDRA preferred term is defined as a Tier 2 event if there are at least 1% of participants in at least 1 vaccine group reporting the event; and (3) Tier 3 events are those that are neither Tier 1 nor Tier 2 events. For both Tier 1 and Tier 2 events, 2-sided 95% CIs for the difference between the vaccine and placebo groups in the percentage of participants reporting the events based on the Miettinen and Nurminen metho d10 will be provided . In addition, for Tier 1 events, the asymptotic p -values will also be presented for the difference between groups in the percentage of participants reporting the events, based on the same test statistic and under the assumption that t he test statistic is asymptotically normally distributed. Descriptive summary statistics (counts, percentages, and associated Clopper -Pearson 95% CIs) will be provided for any AE events for each vaccine group. SAEs will be categorized according to MedDRA terms. Counts, percentages, and the associated Clopper -Pearson 95% CIs of SAEs from Dose 1 to 6 months after the last dose will be provided for each vaccine group. The safety analyses are based on the safety po pulation. Participants will be summarized by vaccine group according to the investigational products they actually received. Missing reactogenicity e-diary data will not be imputed; missing AE dates will be handled according to the Pfizer safety rules. Secondary Not applicable (N/A) Exploratory N/A 9.4.4. Other Analyses The ratios of (GMFR A to GMFR B) and (GMFR A to GMFR C) may be explored, where GMFR A is the geometric mean of the ratio of the SARS -CoV-2 neutralizing titer at the postvaccination time point to the corresponding titer at the pre vaccination time point, GFMR B is the geometric mean of the ratio of the S1-binding IgG level at the postvaccination time point to the corresponding IgG level at the pre vaccination time point, and GMFR C is the geometric mean of the ratio of the RBD -binding IgG level at the postvaccination time point to the corresponding antibody level at the pre vaccination time point. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 111 The safety data and immunogenicity results for individual s with confirmed stable HIV disease will be summarized descriptively. Furthermore, VE may be assessed if there is a sufficient number of COVID -19 cases in this group of participants. The safety and immunogenicity results for individuals 16 to 55 years of age vaccinated with study intervention produced by manufacturing \"Process 1\" and each lot of \"Process 2\" will be summarized descriptively. A random sample of 250 participants from those vaccinated with study intervention produced by manufacturing \"Proces s 1\" will be selected randomly for the analysis . 9.5. Interim Analyses As this is a sponsor open -label study during Phase 1, the sponsor may conduct unblinded reviews of the data during the course of the study for the purpose of safety assessment, facilitating dose escalation decisions, and/or supporting clinical development. During Phase 2/ 3, 4 IAs were planned to be performed by an unblinded statistical team after accrual of at least 32, 62, 92, and 120 cases. However, for operational reasons, the first planned IA was not performed. Consequently, 3 IAs are now planned to be performed after accrual of at least 62, 92, and 120 cases. At these IAs, futility and VE with respect to the first primary endpoint will be assessed as follows : VE for the firs t primary objective will be evaluated. Overwhelming efficacy will be declared if the first primary study objective is met . The criteria for success at an interim analysis are based on the posterior probability (ie , P[VE >30% |data]) at the current number of cases. Overwhelming efficacy will be declared if the posterior probability is higher than the success threshold. The success threshold for each interim analysis will be calibrated to protect overall type I error at 2.5%. Addit ional details about the success threshold or boundary calculation at each interim analysis will be provided in the SAP . The study will stop for lack of benefit (futility) if the predicted probability of success at the final analysis or study success is < 5%. The posterior predictive POS will be calculated using a beta -binomial model . The futility assessment will be performed for the first primary endpoint and t he futility boundary may be subject to change to reflect subsequent program -related decisions by the sponsor. Efficacy and futility boundaries will be applied in a nonbinding way. Bayesian approaches require specification of a prior distribution for the possible values of the unknown vaccine effect, thereby accounting for uncertainty in its value. A minimally informative beta prior, beta (0.700102, 1), is proposed for = (1 -VE)/(2 -VE). The prior is centered at = 0.4118 (VE=30%) which can be considered pessimistic. The prior allows considerable uncertainty; the 95% interval for is (0.005, 0.964) and the for VE -26.2, 0.995). PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 112 Table 6 illustrates the boundary for efficacy and futil ity if, for example, IAs are performed after accrual of 32, 62, 92, and 120 cases in participants without evidence of infection before vaccinatio n. Note that although the first IA was not performed, the statistical criterion for demonstrating success (posterior probability threshold) at the interim (>0.995 ) and final (>0.986) analyses remains unchanged. Similarly , the futility boundaries are not c hanged. Table 6. Interim Analysis Plan and Boundaries for Efficacy and Futil ity Analysis Number of Cases Success Criteriaa Futility Boundary VE Point Estimate (Case Split) VE Point Estimate (Case Split) IA1 N/A = not applicable; VE = vaccine efficacy. Note: Case split = vaccine : placebo. a. Interim efficacy claim : P(VE >30%|data) > 0.995; success at the final analysis: > 0.986 . Additional design operating characteristics ( the boundary based on the number of cases observed in the vaccine group; the probabilities for efficacy and futility given assumed various VEs with a 1:1 randomization ratio) are listed in Table 7 and Table 8, for IAs conducted at 32, 62, 92, and 120 cases and the final analysis at 164 cases . Althou gh the IA at 32 cases was not performed, the overall Type I error (overall probability of success when true VE=30%) will still be strictly controlled at 0.025 with the originally proposed s uccess/futility boundaries .

Only the first primary endpoint will be analyzed at IA. If the first primary objective is met, the second primary objective will be evaluated at the final analysis. After the prim ary objectives are met, the first 6 secondary VE endpoints (confirmed COVID -19 occurring from 14 days after the second dose in participants without evidence of infection and in all participants, confirmed severe COVID -19 occurring from 7 days and from 14 days after the second dose in participants without evidence of infection and in all participants) will be evaluated sequentially in the stated order , by the same method used for the evaluation of primary VE endpoint s. Success thresholds for secondary VE endpoints will be appropriately chosen to control overall Type I error at 2.5%. Further details will be provided in the SAP. The remaining secondary VE endpoints will be evaluated descriptively to calculate the observed VE with 95% CIs. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 114 9.5.1.

Data Monitoring Committee or Other Independent Oversight Committee This study will use an IRC , a DMC , and a group o f internal case reviewers . The IRC is independent of the study team and includes only internal members. The DMC is independent of the study team and include s only external members. The IRC and DMC charters describe the role of the IRC and DMC in more detail. The responsibilities of the IRC are only in Phase 1 and will include: Review of safety data to permit dose escalations in the 18 - to 55 -year age cohort Review of safety data in the case of a stopping rule being met PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 115 Review of safety and /or immunogenicity da ta to: Allow groups of participants of 65 to 85 years of age to proceed Select vaccine candidate/dose level(s) to proceed into Phase 2/3. Data supporting the selection, includ ing results for both binding antibody levels and neutralizing titers , and the ra tio between them , will also be submitted to the FDA for review Review of any available safety and/or immunogenicity data generated during the course of this study, or the BioNTech study conducted in Germany, to determine: Whether any groups may not be star ted Whether any groups may be terminated early Whether any groups may be added with dose levels below the lowest stated dose or intermediate between the lowest and highest stated doses Contemporaneous review of all NAAT -confirmed COVID -19 illnesses in Phase 1 The DMC will be responsible for ongoing monitoring of the safety of participants in the study according to the charter. This may include, but is not limited to: Contemporaneous review of related AEs up to 1 month after completion of the vaccination schedule Contemporaneous review of all SAEs up to 6 months after completion of the vaccination schedule Contemporaneous review of all NAAT -confirmed COVID -19 illnesses in Phase 1 At the time of the planned IAs, and ad hoc if r equested by the unblinded team, review of cases of COVID -19 for an adverse imbalance of cases of COVID -19 and/or severe COVID -19 between the vaccine and placebo groups The recommendations made by the DMC to alter the conduct of the study will be forwarded to the appropriate Pfizer personnel for final decision. Pfizer will forward such decisions, which may include summaries of aggregate analyses of safety data, to regulatory authorities, as appropriate. Three blinded case reviewers (medically qualified Pfiz er staff members) will review all potential COVID -19 illness events. If a NAAT -confirmed case in Phase 2/ 3 may be considered severe, or not, solely on the basis of \"significant acute renal, hepatic, or neurologic dysfunction ,\" the blinded data will be rev iewed by the case reviewers to assess whether the criterion is met; the majority opinion will prevail.

No records may be transferred to another location or party without written notification to the sponsor. The investigator must ensure that the records continue to be stored securely for as long as they are maintaine d. When participant data are to be deleted, the investigator will ensure that all copies of such data are promptly and irrevocably deleted from all systems. The investigator(s) will notify the sponsor or its agents immediately of any regulatory inspection notification in relation to the study. Furthermore, the investigator will cooperate with the sponsor or its agents to prepare the investigator site for the inspection and will allow the sponsor or its agent, whenever feasible, to be present during the ins pection. The investigator site and investigator will promptly resolve any discrepancies that are identified between the study data and the participant's medical records. The investigator will promptly provide copies of the inspection findings to the spon sor or its agent. Before response submission to the regulatory authorities, the investigator will provide the sponsor or its agents with an opportunity to review and comment on responses to any such findings. 10.1.6. Source Documents Source documents provide evidence for the existence of the participant and substantiate the integrity of the data collected. Source document s are filed at the investigator site. Data reported on the CRF or entered in the eCRF that are from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained . The PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 121 investigator may need to request previous medical records or transfer records, depending on the study. Also, current medical records must be available. Definition of what constitutes source data can be found in the study monitoring plan. Description of the use of computerized system is documented in the Data Management Plan . 10.1.7. Study and Site Start and Closure The study start date is the date on which the clini cal study will be open for recruitment of participants. The first act of recruitment is the date of the first participant's first visit and will be the study start date. The sponsor designee reserves the right to close the study site or terminate the study at any time for any reason at the sole discretion of the sponsor. Study sites will be closed upon study completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study supplies have been collected and a study -site closure visit has b een performed. The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time upon notification to the sponsor or designee if requested to do so by the responsible IRB/EC or if such termination is required to protect the health of study participants . Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor may include but are not limited to: Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requirements of the IRB/EC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines ; Inadequate recruitment of participants by the investigator ; Discontinuation of further study intervention development . If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the ECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any CRO (s) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regu latory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the participant and should assure appropriate participant therapy and/or follow -up. Study termination is also provided for in the clinical study agreement. If there is any conflict between the c ontract and this protocol , the contract will control as to termination rights. 10.1.8. Sponsor's Qualified Medical Personnel The contact information for the sponsor's appropriately qualified medical personnel for the study is documented in the study contact list l ocated in the supporting study documentation . PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 122 To facilitate access to appropriately qualified medical personnel on study -related medical questions or problems, participant s are provided with a contact card at the time of informed consent . The contact card contains, at a minimum, protocol and study intervention identifiers, participant numbers, contact information for the investigator site, and contact details for a contact center in the event that the investigator site staff cannot be re ached to provide advice on a medical question or problem originating from another healthcare professional not involved in the participant 's participation in the study. The contact number can also be used by investigator staff if they are seeking advice on medical questions or problems; however, it should be used only in the event that the established communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team are not available. It is therefore intended to augment, but not replace, the establis hed communication pathways between the investigator site and the study team for advice on medical questions or problems that may arise during the study. The contact number is not intended for use by the participant directly, and if a participant calls tha t number, he or she will be directed back to the investigator site. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 123 10.2. Appendix 2: Clinical Laboratory Tests The following safety laboratory tests will be performed at times defined in the SoA section of this protocol. Additional labor atory results may be reported on these samples as a result of the method of analysis or the type of analyzer used by the clinical laboratory , or as derived from calculated values. These additional tests would not require additional collection of blood. U nscheduled clinical laboratory measurements may be obtained at any time during the study to assess any perceived safety issues . Hematology Chemistry Other Hemoglobin Hematocrit RBC count MCV count (Abs) Basophils (Abs) Lymphocytes and AST, Alkaline phosphatase Urine p regnancy test ( -hCG) At screen ing only: Hepatitis B core antibody Hepatitis B surface antigen Hepatitis C antibody Human immunodeficiency virus Investigators must document their review of each laboratory safety report.

Definition of AE AE Definition An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of study intervention. Events Meeting the AE Definition Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) or other safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital sign measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and scie ntific judgment of the investigator Any abnormal laboratory test results that meet any of the conditions below must be recorded as an AE: Is associated with accompanying symptoms . Requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention . Leads to a change in study dosing (outside of any protocol -specified dose adjustments) or discontinuation from the study, significant additional concomitant drug treatment, or other therapy . Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition inc luding either an increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention administration even though it may have been present before the start of the study. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequ elae of a suspected drug -drug interaction. Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose t aken with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 126 Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant's condition. The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the participant's condition. Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE. Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social an d/or convenience admission to a hospital). Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen. 10.3.2. Definition of SAE If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: a. Results in death b. Is life -threatening The term \"life-threatening \" in the definition of \"serious \" refers to an event in which the participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether \"hospitalization\" occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 127 Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE. d. Results in persistent disability/incapacity The term disability m eans a substantial disruption of a person's ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect f. Other situations: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the participant or may require medical or surgical in tervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious. Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at hom e for aller gic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Suspected transmission via a Pfizer product of an infectious agent, pathogenic or nonpathogenic, is considered serious. The event may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings indicating an infection in a patient exposed to a Pfizer product. The terms \"suspected transmission\" and \"transmission\" are considered synonymo us. These cases are considered unexpected and handled as serious expedited cases by pharmacovigilance personnel. Such cases are also considered for reporting as product defects, if appropriate. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 128 10.3.3. Recording /Reporting and Follow -up of AE s and/or SAE s AE and SAE Recording /Reporting The table below summarizes the requirements for recording adverse events on the CRF and for reporting serious adverse events on the Vaccine SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety. These requirements are delineated for 3 types of events: (1) SAEs; (2) nonserious adverse events (AEs); and (3) exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure. It should be noted that the Vaccine SAE Report Form for reporting of SAE information is not the same as the AE page of the CRF. When the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. AEs should be recorded using concise medical terminology and the same AE term should be used on both the CRF and the Vaccine SAE Report Form for reporting o f SAE information. Safety Event Recorded on the CRF Reported on the Vaccine SAE Report Form to Pfizer Safety Within 24 Hours of Awareness SAE All All Nonserious AE All None Exposure to the study intervention under study during pregnancy or breastfeeding, and occupational exposure All AEs/SAEs associated with exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding Occupational exposure is not recorded. All (and EDP supplemental form for EDP) Note: Include all SAEs associ ated with exposure during pregnancy or breastfeeding. Include all AEs/SAEs associated with occupational exposure. When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostic reports) related to the event. The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the CRF. It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant's medical records to Pfizer Saf ety in lieu of completion of the Vaccine SAE Report Form /AE/SAE CRF page. There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by Pfizer Safety . In this case, all participant identifiers, with the PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 129 exception of the participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to Pfizer Safety . The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. Assessment of Intensity The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the study and assign it to 1 of the following categories: GRADE If required on the AE page of the CRF, the investigator will use the adjectives MILD, MODERATE, SEVE RE, or LIFE -THREATENING to describe the maximum intensity of the AE. For purposes of consistency, these intensity grades are defined as follows: 1 MILD Does not interfere with participant 's usual function. 2 MODERATE Interferes to some extent with participant 's usual function. 3 SEVERE Interferes significantly with participant 's usual function. 4 LIFE -THREATENING Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. Assessment of Causality The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. A \"reasonable possibility\" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rath er than a relationship cannot be ruled out. The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship. Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of t he event to study intervention administration , will be considered and investigated. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 130 The investigator will also consult the IB and/or product information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment. For each AE/SAE, the investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality. There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the investigator has minimal information to inclu de in the initial report to the sponsor . However, it is very important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to the sponsor . The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and send a n SAE follow -up report with the updated causality assessment. The causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. If the investigator does not kn ow whether or not the study intervention caused the event, then the event will be handled as \"related to study intervention \" for reporting purposes, as defined by the sponsor . In addition, if the investigator determines that an SAE is associated with stud y procedures, the investigator must record this causal relationship in the source documents and CRF, and report such an assessment in the dedicated section of the Vaccine SAE Report Form and in accordance with the SAE reporting requirements. Follow -up of AEs and SAEs The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the sponsor to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other healthcare providers . If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -up period, the investigator wi ll provide Pfizer Safety with a copy of any postmortem findings including histopathology . New or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed CRF. The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24 hours of recei pt of the information. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 131 10.3.4. Reporting of SAEs SAE Reporting to Pfizer Safety via Vaccine SAE Report Form Facsimile transmission of the Vaccine SAE Report Form is the preferred method to transmit this information to Pfizer Safety . In circumstances when the fac simile is not working , notification by telephone is acceptable with a copy of the Vaccine SAE Report Form sent by overnight mail or courier service. Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete and sign the Vaccine SAE Report Form pages within the designated reporting time frames. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 132 10.4. Appendix 4: Contraceptive Guidance 10.4.1. Male Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria Male participants are eligible to participate if they agree to the following requirements during the intervention period and for at least 28 days after the last dose of study intervention , which corresponds to the time neede d to eliminate reproductive safety risk of the study intervention(s): Refrain from donating sperm . PLUS either : Be abstinent from heterosexual intercourse with a female of childbearing potential as their preferred and usual lifestyle (abstinent on a long -term and persistent basis) and agree to remain abstinent . OR Must agree to use a male condom when engaging in any activity that allows for passage of ejaculate to another person . In addition to male condom use, a highly effective method of contraception may be considered in WOCBP partners of male participants (refer to the list of highly effective methods below in Section 10.4.4 ). 10.4.2. Fem ale Participant Reproductive Inclusion Criteria A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and at least 1 of the following conditions applies: Is not a WOCBP (see definitions below in Section 10.4.3 ). OR Is a WOCBP and using an acceptable contraceptive method as described below during the intervention period (for a minimum of 28 days after the last dose of study intervention) . The investigator should evaluate the effectiveness of the contraceptive method in relationship to the first dose of study intervention . The investigator is responsible for review of medica l history, menstrual history, and recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early undetected pregnancy. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 133 10.4.3. Woman of Childbearing Potential A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal unless permanently sterile (see below). If fertility is unclear (eg, amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle cannot be confirmed before the first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should be considered. Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP: 1. Premenarchal . 2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following: Documented hysterectomy; Documented bilateral salpingectomy; Documented bilateral oophorectomy. For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the above, (eg, mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity), investigator discretion should be applied to determining study entry. Note: Documentation for any of the above categories can come from th e site personnel's review of the participant's medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview. The method of documentation should be recorded in the participant's medical record for the study. 3. Postmenopausal female : A postmenopausal st ate is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause . In addition, a high FSH level in the postmenopausal range must be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women under 60 years of age and not using hormonal contraception or HRT. Female on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of the nonestrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study enrollment. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 134 10.4.4. Contracepti on Methods Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local availability/regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods fo r those participating in clinical trials. 1. Implantable progestogen -only hormone contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation . 2. Intrauterine device . 3. Intrauterine hormone -releasing system . 4. Bilateral tubal occlusion . 5. Vasectomized partner : Vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraceptive method provided that the partner is the sole sexual partner of the woman of childbearing potential and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception shou ld be used. The s permatogenesis cycle is approximately 90 days. 6. Combined (estrogen - and progestogen -containing) hormonal contraception associated with ovulation : Oral; Injectable . 8. Sexual abstinence : Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study intervention. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the participant. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 135 9. Progestogen -only oral hormonal contraception where inhibition of ovula tion is not the primary mode of action . 10. Male or female condom with or without spermicide . 11. Cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide . 12. A combination of male condom with either cervical cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide (double -barrier method s). PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 136 10.5. Appendix 5: Liver Safety: Suggested Actions and Follow -up Assessments Potential Cases of Drug -Induced Liver Injury Humans exposed to a drug who show no sign of liver injury (as determined by elevations in transaminases) are termed \"tolerators,\" while those who show transient liver injury, but adapt are termed \"adaptors.\" In some participant s, transaminase elevations are a harbinger of a more serious potential outcome. These participant s fail to adapt and therefore are \"susceptible\" to progressive and serious liver injury, commonly referred to as DILI. Participant s who experience a transaminase elevation above 3 \u00d7 ULN should be monitored more frequently to determine if they are an \"adaptor\" or are \"suscep tible.\" LFTs are not required as a routine safety monitoring procedure for all participants in this study. However, should an investigator deem it necessary to assess LFTs because a participant presents with clinical signs/symptoms, such LFT results shoul d be managed and followed as described below. In the majority of DILI cases, elevations in AST and/or ALT precede TBili elevations (>2 \u00d7 ULN) by several days or weeks. The increase in TBili typically occurs while AST/ALT is/are still elevated above 3 \u00d7 ULN (ie, AST/ALT and TBili values will be elevated within the same lab oratory sample). In rare instances, by the time TBili elevations are detected, AST/ALT values might have decreased. This occurrence is still regarded as a potential DILI. Therefore, ab normal elevations in either AST OR ALT in addition to TBili that meet the criteria outlined below are considered potential DILI (assessed per Hy's law criteria) cases and should always be considered important medical events, even before all other possible causes of liver injury have been excluded. The threshold of laboratory abnormalities for a potential DILI case depends on the participant 's individual baseline values and underlying conditions. Participant s who present with the following laboratory abnorm alities should be evaluated further as potential DILI (Hy's law) cases to definitively determine the etiology of the abnormal laboratory values: Participant s with AST/ALT and TBili baseline values within the normal range who subsequently present with AST OR ALT values >3 \u00d7 ULN AND a TBili value >2 phosphatase value <2 \u00d7 ULN or not available. For participant s with baseline AST OR ALT OR TBili values above the ULN, the following threshold values are used in the definition mentioned above, as needed, depending on which values are above the ULN at baseline: Preexisting AST or ALT baseline values above the normal range: AST or ALT values >2 times the baseline values AND >3 \u00d7 \u00d7 -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 137 Preexisting values of TBili above the normal range: TBili level increased from baseline value by an amount of at least 1 \u00d7 ULN or if the value reaches >3 \u00d7 ULN (whichever is sma ller). Rises in AST/ALT and TBili separated by more than a few weeks should be assessed individually based on clinical judgment; any case where uncertainty remains as to whether it represents a potential Hy's law case should be reviewed with the sponsor. The participant should return to the investigator site and be evaluated as soon as possible, preferably within 48 hours from awareness of the abnormal results. This evaluation should include laboratory tests, detailed history, and physical assessment. In addition to repeating measurements of AST and ALT and TBili for suspected cases of Hy's law, additional laboratory tests should include albumin, CK, direct and indirect bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase. Consideration shoul d also be given to drawing a separate tube of clotted blood and an anticoagulated tube of blood for further testing, as needed, for further contemporaneous analyses at the time of the recognized initial abnormalities to determine etiology. A detailed hist ory, including relevant information, such as review of ethanol, acetaminophen /paracetamol (either by itself or as a coformulated product in prescription or over -the-counter medications) , recreational drug, supplement (herbal) use and consumption, family hi story, sexual history, travel history, history of contact with a jaundiced person, surgery, blood transfusion, history of liver or allergic disease, and potential occupational exposure to chemicals, should be collected. Further testing for acute hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E infection and liver imaging (eg, biliary tract) and collection of serum sample s for acetaminophen /paracetamol drug and/or protein adduct levels may be warranted. All cases demonstrated on repeat testing as meeting the laboratory criteria of AST/ALT and TBili elevation defined above should be considered potential DILI (Hy's law) cases if no other reason for the LFT abnormalities has yet been found. Such potential D ILI (Hy's law) cases are to be reported as SAEs, irrespective of availability of all the results of the investigations performed to determine etiology of the LFT abnormalities.

Appendix 7: Stopping and Alert Rule s for Enhanced COVID -19 In Phase 2/ 3, the unblinded team supporting the DMC (reporting team) , including an unblinded medical monitor, will review cases of severe COVID -19 as they are received, and will review AEs at least weekly for additional potential cas es of severe COVID -19 and will contact the DMC in the event that the stopping rule or an alert is met. Specifically, the unblinded reporting team will contact the DMC chair, who will then convene the full DMC as soon as possible. The DMC will review all available safety and/or efficacy data at the time of the review. The DMC will make one of the following recommendations to Pfizer: withhold final recommendation until further information/data are provided, continue the study as designed, modify the study and continue , or stop the study. The final decision to accept or reject the committee's recommendation resides with Pfizer management and will be communicated to the committee chairperson in writing . At any point the unblinded team may discuss with the DMC chair whether the DMC should review cases for an adverse imbalance of cases of COVID -19 and/or severe COVID -19 between the vaccine and placebo groups (see Section 9.6 ). In addition, a t the time of the IAs after accrual of at least 62, 92 , and 120 cases, the number of severe COVID -19 cases in the vaccine and placebo group s will be assessed. Stopping and alert rules will be applied as follows. The stopping rule will be triggered when the 1-sided probabilit y of observing the same or a more extreme case split is 5% or less when the true incidence of severe disease is the same for vaccine and placebo participants, and alert criteria are triggered when this probability is less than 11%. In addition, when the t otal number of severe cases is low (15 or less), the unblinded team supporting the DMC will implement the alert rule when a reverse case split of 2:1 or worse is observed. For example, at 3 cases 2:1, at 4 cases 3:1 , etc. Below 15 cases , this rule is more rigorous than requiring the probability of an observed adverse split or worse be <11%. The stopping rule and alert rules are illustrated in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively, when the total number of severe cases is 20 or less. For example, when there are 7 severe cases, the adverse split has to be 7:0 to stop the stu dy, but a split of 5:2 would trigger the alert rule. Similarly, when there is a total of 9severe cases, an adverse split of 9:0 triggers the stopping rule, while a split of 6:3 or worse triggers the alert rule. The alert rule may be triggered with as few as 2 cases, with a split of 2:0. PF-07302048 (BNT162 RNA -Based COVID -19 Vaccines) Protocol C4591001 Page 143 Table 10.

Appendix 8: Criteria for Allowing Inclusion of Participants With C hronic Stable HIV, HCV, or HBV Infection Potential participants with chronic stable HIV, HCV, or H BV infection may be considered for inclusion if they fulfil l the following respective criteria. Known HIV infection Confirmed stable HIV disease defined as documented viral load <50 copies/mL and CD4 count >200 cells/mm3 within 6 months before enrol lment , and on stable antiretroviral therapy for at least 6 months. Known HCV infection History of chronic HCV with evidence of sustained virological response (defined as undetectable HCV RNA) for 12 weeks following HCV treatment or without evidence of HCV RNA viremia (undetectable HCV viral load) . Known Confirmed inactive chronic HBV infection, defined as HBsAg present for 6 months and the following : HBeAg negative, anti -HBe positive Serum HBV DNA <2000 IU/mL Persistently normal ALT and/or AST levels In those who have had a liver biopsy perform ed, findings that confirm the absence of significant necroinflammation.
