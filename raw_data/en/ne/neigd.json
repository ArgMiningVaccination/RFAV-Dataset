Let's explore a few of them.", "sitename": "ExploreHealthCareers.org", "date": "2017-08-22", "cleaned_text": "Traveling the world is a common \"bucket list\" item. Often, people think the only time to act on their desire to travel is before starting their career or after retiring. This common misconception is understandable, as many careers have responsibilities that tether professionals to one place. There's good news if you're considering a career in health care: Many positions offer opportunities to act on your wanderlust even while making a living and saving lives. More and more students are taking gap or [glide years](/glide-not-glide-4-reasons-consider-taking-year-off/). If you plan to take a year off between high school and undergraduate studies or between undergraduate and graduate schools, this is a great time to do some traveling, but it's not your only option. In fact, many health care career paths offer chances to study abroad or volunteer outside of your home country during your studies. Undergraduate students may consider studying abroad \u2014 that's right, even those who are studying pre-medicine can do so! In fact, studying abroad can make you a more interesting candidate for medical school admissions committees and it can make you a better health care provider, especially since being introduced to new cultures and languages will prepare you to meet your patients' [diverse health care needs](/career-explorer/diversity-matters-health-care/). If studying abroad doesn't work out, consider a summer study program or an internship in a different country. These programs are shorter and often focus specifically on learning a language through immersion in a culture that uses it. Some programs include trips to multiple countries within one term, giving you an opportunity to see health care in several different places in a short time period. Once you do finish your studies, even more opportunities to travel may be available as you enter the health care workforce, especially if you're interested in [nursing](/field/nursing/), [dentistry](/field/dentistry/) or [public health](/field/public-health/). Take nursing beyond your country's borders [Registered nurses](/career/nursing/nurse-researcher/) play an important part in the treatment of patients around the world. Because their work is important in so many different environments, nurses have an incredible amount of opportunities to travel nationally internationally. [HealthCare Volunteer](http://www.healthcarevolunteer.com/) has connected over 40,000 volunteer nurses with positions to help others. [Doctors without Borders](http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/) is always looking for nurses to travel to other countries to help, especially operating room nurses, [nurse midwives](/career/nursing/nurse-midwife/) and [nurse anesthetists](/career/nursing/nurse-anesthetist/). Nurses can sharpen their skills by taking advantage of travel opportunities. Working in new environments, especially with those who speak a different language than their native one, is beneficial since it prepares these health care professionals for the many unique situations in which they will work throughout their caring career. Keep people smiling around the world Dental health is lacking in many parts of the world, opening many opportunities to work and volunteer abroad if the dental field interests you. [Dentists](/career/dentistry/dentist/) are needed, as are [dental educators](/career/dentistry/allied-dental-educator/), [dental assistants](/career/dentistry/dental-assistant/), [dental laboratory technicians](/career/dentistry/dental-laboratory-technician/) and [hygienists](/career/dentistry/dental-hygienist/).
