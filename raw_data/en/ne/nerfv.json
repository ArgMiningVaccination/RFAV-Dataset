This depends on the type of exercise you're doing. Whether it's HIIT, endurance or strength training, the timing of your fuelling will differ. Generally, it's a good idea to take your supplement just before your session if it's high intensity, while long distance running or similar endurance exercise may benefit from intra workout supplementation. You could use energy powders, gels or even gummies during longer or more intense exercise sessions. WHAT ARE THE BEST ENERGY SUPPLEMENTS? The best energy supplements provide you with lasting energy and deliver carbohydrates quickly and efficiently, so your body has the energy to push harder even in the toughest of sessions Carbohydrates play an important role in pre- and post-workout supplementation, as they help to produce Adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP provides energy to drive many of your body's processes, including contraction of the muscles and nerve impulse propagation. Carbohydrates also support healthy muscles for repair and allow you to have the fuel required to push harder and elevate your performance. Something to also consider is the amount of caffeine you want in your energy source. Caffeine has been proven to boost mental and physical performance when undertaking Isotonic exercise, making it a great ingredient option. However, it is not necessary for everyone. So take your own health and needs into consideration. You may also want to consider which energy supplements will be best for the type of exercise you are undertaking. For example, energy gels are perfect for running, cycling, or playing competitive sports, as you might want a light stomach and a quick and easy boost of carbohydrates. WHAT IS THE BEST ISOTONIC DRINK? The best isotonic drinks give you sugars for energy so you can fuel for your body. We believe the more efficient formats like gels and powders stand out because they allow you to supplement intra-workout without any problems! Plus, our SiS energy range comes in a variety of flavours, sugar options, and caffeinated or non-caffeinated options to suit your needs. Looking to unlock your potential?
