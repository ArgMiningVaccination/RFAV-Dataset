A person who has active tuberculosis shall be considered infectious until three consecutive sputum smears from a pulmonary or laryngeal source collected on separate days at medically appropriate intervals have tested negative for tuberculosis and the clinical symptoms of tuberculosis have resolved or significantly improved. 22 \u00a711.23 Removal and detention of cases, contacts and carriers who are or may be a danger to public health; other orders.
