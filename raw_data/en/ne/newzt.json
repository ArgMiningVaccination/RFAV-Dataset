Spread to others by droplets when people with the flu talk, sneeze, or cough.

Strategy Take Home Points Suggested Action Items Vaccination The best way to prevent the flu in SNFs is annual vaccination among HCP and patients/residents HCP vaccination is protective to patients and a critical component of flu prevention efforts Identify strategies to promote vaccinations among HCP and patients/residents Promote compliance with LA County Health Order Education and ILI Recognition Employees, patients, and visitors should be educated on flu symptoms, transmission, and respiratory etiquette Sick visitors and healthcare workers are an important source of influenza in SNF Improper collection of flu specimens is common and can lead to false -negative results Provide signage and educational materials for patients and visitors Respiratory etiquette Establish and enforce policies for visitor screening and sick healthcare workers (designate ILI ambassador) Conduct daily active screening for ILI symptoms during peak flu season Infection Control Heighten staff awareness around standard and droplet precautions Promote hand hygiene compliance Many free resources through LAC DPH, CDPH, and CDC Involve the Public Health Department early with any influenza case in SNF Educate staff on proper isolation procedures Have hand hygiene and isolation supplies readily available Monitor and feedback compliance with isolation and hand hygiene 34 Specific Guidance for LTCF The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Acute Communicable Disease Control Other Valuable Resources (1) County of Los Angeles Department of Public Health (DPH) -Acute Communicable Disease Control Program Influenza Vaccination for HCP for SNFs : http://www.ph.lacounty.gov/acd/Flu.htm -Immunization Program : http ://www.ph.lacounty.gov/ip/flu/index.htm California Department of Public Health (CDPH): -The HAI Program and Healthcare Personnel Influenza Vaccination http ://www.cdph.ca.gov/programs/hai/Pages/InfluenzaVaccination.aspx -Influenza Vaccination and Respiratory Disease Prevention Educational Materials http://eziz.org/resources/flu -promo -materials / 35 Other Valuable Resources (2) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Influenza Vaccination Information for Health Care Workers http://www.cdc.gov/flu/healthcareworkers.htm New York State Department of Health: Resources and Guidance - HCP Vaccination http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/immunization/toolkits/hc_personnel_hospital/ 36 Acknowledgments DPH MD Assoc.
