Thank you for taking the time to review these comments . We, the Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine, have a number of concerns about the draft g uidelines as they are currently written. We think that the current Compliance Policy Guide on homeopathic medicines has w orked well since its inception and should be kept in place. Furthermore, we encourage positive regulations that provide consumers with safe health choices . This letter offers evidence and arguments for the proposition that the FDA -and the health of the U.S . population - would likely benefit from the inclusion of experts in the fields of homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine in the development of new guidelines. The Physicians' Association for Anthroposophic Medicine (PAAM) is a professional organization of physicians (M. D. or D.O.), medical students and mid -level providers who are interested in or practice anthroposophic medicine in the U.S. The practicing physicians are conventionally trained and fully l icensed to practice medicine in their respective st ates. Anthroposophic medicine is a consistent, coherent and century -long integrative philosophy and scientific approach that informs the diagnosis of illness and the formulation, production, and use of medicines and other therapeutic modalities. It is a medical system that relies on and extends conventional medicine. It is not contrary to the legitimate conceptions of science and conventional medicine. In addition to modern pharmaceutical medicines, the therapeutic remedies include homeopathic substances, i n both low potencies and medium potencies with multiple routes of administration, and organic herbal products, all of which are produced under good manufacturing processes. Therefore , some homeopathic medicines are important to us and to our safe practice of medicine. Anthroposophic medicine is recognized as a distinct system of medicine in Germa ny and Switzerland. The German Commission C regulates anthroposophic remedies in Germany and has helpful information on this subject . The following references provi de a helpful introduction to anthroposophic medicine and how its specialists think and work: Kienle GS, et.al. Anthroposophic medicine: an integrative medical system originating in Europe. Global Advances in Health and Medicine Journal , Novem ber 2013, 2 ;6:20 -31. Bartelme R.

Historical evidence, long clinical experience, and good research attest to their safety as well as that of anthroposophic medic inal products (AMPs) . Because of the use of homeopathi c medicines within anthroposophic medicine, the safety of the latter also speaks for the safety of the former. High -quality research on the safety of anthroposophic and homeopathic medicine has been published in Health Technology Assessments (HTA) and in p eer-reviewed medical journals. When compared to conventional pharmaceuticals, reports of documented adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are very rare . A HTA report on homeopathy compiled on behalf of the Swiss Federal Office for Public Health (BAG) came to the c onclusion that \"taking internal and external validity into account, effectiveness of homeopathy can be supported by clinical evidence and professional and adequate application [can] be regarded as safe\". In addition, a comprehensive HTA report on anthropos ophic medicine of 195 clinical studies commissioned by the Swiss Federal Social Insurance Office as part of a national Complementary Medicine Evaluation Programme (PEK) came to the conclusion that despite variable methodologic quality of the studies the ov erwhelming results demonstrated the effectiveness and safety of anthroposophic medicine . Higher quality studies still demonstrated effectiveness and safety. Please see the following: Bornhoft G, et al.

There is also a 2011 update to the report but published only in German. We would strongly recommend that the current and very workable Compliance Policy Guide be maintained. This directive for field agents is more specific and has wo rked well for 25 years. The FD A has always used a risk -based approach to homeopathy that appears to work well and conserves the agency's limited resources. The FDA's assumptio n that parenteral and ophthalmic homeopathic remedies pose a greater risk is not evidence -based for any of these types of products that meet GMP standards. There are onl y a few reported ADRs, and 2 review s listed above by Baars and Jong MC et.al. , as well as the EvaMed data (listed above, Hamre H, et.al. 2017) clearly demonstrate this and prove their safety. The German Commission C has been providing regulatory oversi ght and continues to ensure the safety of these types of medicines . In addition, re cent research documents the safety of parenteral homeopathic/anthroposophic mistletoe products: Steele ML et al. Safety of intravenous application of mistletoe ( Viscum album L.) preparations in oncology: an observational study. Evidence -Based Compl Alte rn Med , 2014 May 15 . Steele ML, et al.

Safety of higher dosages of Viscum album L. in animal and humans - systematic review of immune changes and safety parameters. BMC Compl Altern Med 2011; 11:72) . Homeopathic/anthroposophic medicinal products are proven to be much safer than other approved pharmaceutical medications . Hamre H, et al.'s large, prospective, multicenter, observational pharmacovigilance study of 38 physicians in outpatient care in Germany (listed above, Hamre H et.al. 2017) has important data comparing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from AMPs and from non-AMPs (convention al pharmaceutical medicines). As noted above, since many AMPs are homeopathic formulations, the safety of the former speak for the safety of homeopathic medicines. This was a 10 -year study with a mean follow -up of 27 months. ADRs were prospectively monitor ed in 44,662 patients with 311,731 AMP prescriptions of 1722 different AMPs, including anthrop osophic mistletoe. Overall, ADRs of any intensity occurred in 0.071% of AMP prescriptions (rare) and in 0.502% of patients receiving AMPs without prescription. Se rious ADRs were extremely rare (0.0003%). The highest ADR frequency was 0.29 % for one form of mistletoe. AMPs were much safer, with an odds ratio (OR) of AMP ADRs to non -AMP ADRs of 0.17 (95% CI 0.13 -0.22), p< 0.0001). The difference between AMPs and non -AMPs was even larger for ADRs of high intensity (WHO grade III -IV) (OR 0.11, 95% CI 0.05 -0.24, CI 0.001 -0.271, p< 0.0001). The study also documents a very low incidence of ADRs associated with subcutaneous injection s: 27 ADRs in 16,378 prescriptions (0.165% ADR/prescription), and only one (mistletoe) was classified as \"serious\" (WHO severe criteria, grade III), with complete recovery. There was no WHO grade IV (life threatening) AD R for any AMP. The aforementioned data document s the safety and benefits for anthroposophic and homeopathic medicines, especially when compared to the well -known serious adverse drug reactions caused by conventional pharmaceutical drugs, that often lead to hos pitalization, serious morbidity and mortality. Even FDA -approved over -the-counter drugs like acetaminophen, NSAIDs, and many others have well -known serious toxicities. There is high demand and a genuine need by patients, physicians and other prescribers for non -oral and non -topical routes of administration of homeopathic medicines. These routes of administration are an important part of the approach in anthroposophic medicine. These routes have been in clinical use for about 100 years with an excellent r ecord of safety. For a variety of legitimate clinical reasons these \"more invasive\" routes are used when indicated with appropriate and standard medical precautions. These reasons include: quicker effect; better effect; higher bioavailability (avoids the first pass effect in gastrointestinal tract and liver); easier to use; administration is possible at a precise location ; combination with other therapies is made possible; better treatment compliance; and in some cases, the oral route i s simply not possibl e. See the previousl y listed references below : Baars EW. The benefit/risk balance of subcutaneous injections as used in homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine: a narrative review. European J Integrat Med , 2017 Oct;15:1 -9 Article 3. Hamre H, et al. Use and safety of anthroposophic medicinal products: an analysis o f 44,662 patients from the EvaMed Pharmacovigilance Network. Drugs Real World Outcomes, 2017 Dec;4(4):199 -213. Jong MC, Jong MU, Baars EW . Adverse drug reactions to anthroposophic and homeopathic solutions for injection: a systematic evaluation of German Safety Physicians and other prescribers require the ap propriate degree of freedom, clinical discretion and autonomy to make the best clinical assessment regarding the need for and use of homeopathic medicines. Patients should have the freedom and ability to choose the type of well-established , safe care they desire . There is no clear public health threat when homeopathic remedies have a long safety record and fill a real need in the pluralistic field of modern medici ne. Physicians and mid -level providers in anthroposophic medicine are conventionally trained an d licensed and have additional ly completed an anthroposophic medical training that can lead to certification . This multifaceted training allows for proper, safe and effective assess ment, diagnostic work -up and therapy, as well as the ability to counsel the patient appropriately in order to reach a treatment decision based on informed consent. Anthroposophic medicine and therefore by extension homeopathic medicines can contribute towards solving pressing public health problems, e. g. high rates of antibi otic use and associated antibiotic resistance. See reference below: Hamre H., et al. Antibiotic Use in Children with Acute Respiratory or Ear Infections: Prospective Observational Comparison of Anthroposophic and Conventional Treatment under Routine Primary Care Conditions. Evidence -Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine. 2014; 2014:243801. doi: 10.1155/2014/243801. Epub 2014 Nov 18. In addi tion, a long-term, prospective observational multicenter study of over 1600 outpatients starting anthroposophic medical treatment for a variety of conditions demonstrated not only safety, but also cost effectiveness with much less use of expensive pharmaceutical medications. Please see the reference below for an overview of the 21 published studies in peer -reviewed journals : Hamre H, et.al. Overview of the publications from the anthroposophic outcomes study (AMOS): a whole systems evaluation study. Global Advances in Healt h and Medicine Journal , January 2014, 3;1:54 -70. The FDA's draft guidelines appear too broad and potentially restrictive to us. They threaten to limit legitimate freedom of choice without a clear basis for doing so ; at least this basis is not available to the public (the details of potentially toxic homeopathic teething tablets containing belladonna have not been made public to assess the clinical and manufacturing relevance ). The broad guidelines give too much discretion to individual inspecto rs who may lack sufficient familiarity with homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine. Therefore, the current draft guidelines have an implicit high risk for arbitrary decisions and enforcement. There is also a lack of a clear pathway with appropriate staff t o address unique issues associated with homeopathic and anthroposophic medicine. In our opinion, the FDA's legitimate authority and responsibility for protecting public health would be significantly improved by expert pharmaceutical and clinical representa tives from the fields of homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine working with the FDA. The FDA's legitimate concern that treatments for vulnerable populations need extra scrutiny in regard to homeopathic medicines appears to be based on knowledge and thinking applicable for allopathic pharmaceutical drugs. There is no evidence that this approach is appropriate for homeopathic remedies . Significant reported ADRs are very rare . Trained physicians and other prescribers in homeopathy and anthroposophic medici ne, with the help of published scientific literature, appear at the present time well positioned to assess the risk a homeopathic medicine or a dietary supplement , will pose to an individual vulnerable patient , and carry this medico -legal responsibility . We strongly recommend that the FDA consider having well -qualified experts in these systems of medicine on staff, or as consultants, to better understand and assess any potential risk. Suc h individuals could help write well -informed guidelines that ensure s afety while not unnecessarily restricting the freedom and legitimate needs of patients, physicians and other prescribers. As stated above, the German Commission C regulates the manufacturing of an throposophic remedies and we believe the U.S. Homeopathic Pharmacopeia has appropriate standards for homeopathic remedies available in the U.S. Two previously mentioned publications that have documented the effectiveness, safety and cost of anthropo sophic medicine and homeopathy ( including use in pedi atric and obs tetric populations) are: (1) a Health Technology Assessment r eport to the Swiss government published in book form as Anthroposophic Medicine: Effectiveness, Utility, Costs, Safety by Kienle GS, Kiene H, and Albonico H -U in 2006 and (2) a summarized Swiss Health Technology Assessment report on homeopathy by Bornhoft G, et al, 2006 .

We recognize and support the role and responsibility of the FDA to regulate all kinds of medical products. There is a legi timate concern about certain \"rogue\" products and claims by natural \"herbal\" and \"homeopathic\" products vendors , that lack appropriate studies regarding safety and are without appropriate GMP, that may be trying to escape FDA regulation and control for economic gain. This is in contrast to our documented history of only using a consistent application of our basic therapeutic philosophy, and only using high quality substance procurement and manufacturing st andards. We do not excessively and irresponsibly promote our products . There is published evidence that our approach is not only safe but also cost effective Effectiveness, Utility, Costs, Safety.

For all the above reasons, we respectfull y recommend that the FDA acquire important consultation from experts in the field s of homeopathic and anthroposophic medicine in order to provide appropriate regulation and guidance . We would be happy to provide you with suggestions of such experts. We reiterate that we strongly recommend the FDA maintain or reinstate the workable, current CPG for homeopathic medicines or modify it with the help of recognized experts from the fields of both homeopathy and anthroposophic medicine. Thank you for your time and consideration of this matter. Please contact us at paam@anthroposophy.org . We look forward to a response.
