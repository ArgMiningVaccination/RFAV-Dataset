Research has shown that many modern common diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases and cardiovascular diseases, e.g., thromboembolism, cancer, obesity, or depression, are connected with inflammatory processes. Therefore, new, good stimulators of the immune system's response are sought. They include synthetic compounds as well as biological preparations such as lipopolysaccharides, enzymes, bacterial metabolites, and secondary metabolites of plants, demonstrating a multidirectional effect. Essential oils are characterized by many invaluable activities, including antimicrobial, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunostimulating. Essential oils may stimulate the immune system via the utilization of their constituents, such as antibodies, cytokines, and dendritic cells. Some essential oils may stimulate the proliferation of immune-competent cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and B and T lymphocytes. This review is focused on the ability of essential oils to affect the immune system. It is also possible that essential oil components positively interact with recommended anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial drugs. Thus, there is a need to explore possible synergies between essential oils and their active ingredients for medical use.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2023-08-25", "cleaned_text": "How to Naturally Support the Immune System in Inflammation\u2014Essential Oils as Immune Boosters [https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11092381](https://doi.org/10.3390/biomedicines11092381) [Immunomodulatory Potential of Essential Oils and Their Compounds]( /journal/biomedicines/special_issues/57M321A705 )) Abstract: 1. Introduction [1](#B1-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [1](#B1-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Essential oils, characterized by a wide spectrum of health-supporting activity, including antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory properties, make up a particularly interesting group of herbal metabolites. 2. Action of the Human Immune System [2](#B2-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The innate immune system acts as the first line of response and is responsible for an adequate reaction to injury. Its rapidity is a key factor in the elimination of the transmission of pathogens through their recognition, internalization into phagocytes, and digestion. This process engages receptors called pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), responsible for the recognition of specific structures of microorganisms, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) [ [3](#B3-biomedicines-11-02381)]. During the next step, several types of cytokines, e.g., interleukin 1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-8, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), stimulate neighboring cells [ [4](#B4-biomedicines-11-02381)] to secrete chemokines to begin the inflammatory response [ [5](#B5-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Also, activation of lymphocytes may be related to inflammatory processes [ [5](#B5-biomedicines-11-02381), [6](#B6-biomedicines-11-02381)]. IL-6, which plays a role in the differentiation of B cells, stimulation of immunoglobulin production, induction of the acute phase response, and stimulation of inflammatory processes, is one of the most important cytokines involved in the host defense system as it demonstrates a broad spectrum of immune and hematopoietic properties. Also, IL-8 (a chemokine called C-X-C motif ligand CXCL8) in the immunological response via induction of chemotaxis in target cells and stimulation of phagocytosis [ [5](#B5-biomedicines-11-02381), [7](#B7-biomedicines-11-02381)]. TNF (the inflammatory cytokine) is generated by macrophages or monocytes during acute inflammation processes that lead to necrosis or apoptosis [ [8](#B8-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It is also involved in leukocyte adhesion, the control of blood coagulation, and the of fever [ [9](#B9-biomedicines-11-02381), [10](#B10-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [11](#B11-biomedicines-11-02381), [12](#B12-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [13](#B13-biomedicines-11-02381)]. They may also play a role as antigen-presenting cells, e.g., for a primed specific T cell, or be involved in cytokine production [ [14](#B14-biomedicines-11-02381)], while T cells produce cytokines responsible for B cell division and differentiation into a mature, antibody-producing plasma cell [ [15](#B15-biomedicines-11-02381)]. 3. Influence of the Immune System on Wound Healing [16](#B16-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Chronic non-healing wounds, e.g., those that affect diabetic patients, increase the risk of infection [ [17](#B17-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [18](#B18-biomedicines-11-02381), [19](#B19-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The relationship between epithelial regeneration and AMP production has been proven. Some types of AMPs promote wound-edge keratinocyte proliferation and migration [ [20](#B20-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Additionally, keratinocytes express proteins called TLRs, which are involved in the production of cytokines and chemokines [ [5](#B5-biomedicines-11-02381)]. There are many different types of TLRs expressed throughout the normal human epidermis, but TLR4 is specifically needed in early skin wound healing [ [21](#B21-biomedicines-11-02381)]. TLR activation may affect wound healing in a dose-dependent manner, as it may suppress growth at higher concentrations but promote regeneration at lower concentrations [ [22](#B22-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [16](#B16-biomedicines-11-02381)]. In acute infections, interleukins are secreted into blood vessels from local tissue sites [ [7](#B7-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It is well documented that T cells may affect the wound environment in different ways as they secrete several types of cytokines. T lymphocytes play a role in the production of growth factors and as immunological effector cells during wound healing [ [23](#B23-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Both innate and adaptive responses are needed for cutaneous immunosurveillance and wound healing [ [15](#B15-biomedicines-11-02381), [24](#B24-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Acute wound healing includes the production of specific signaling molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. It is noteworthy that overproduction of cytokines and proteases results in persistent inflammation, thus affecting wound healing. Therefore, the immune processes must be monitored to ensure successful wound healing [ [24](#B24-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [25](#B25-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The situation becomes more complicated when microbes are able to produce biofilm. It has been proven that a chronic biofilm infection is related to a permanent and lower-grade host inflammatory response (lower levels of IL-1 and TNF expression) when compared with an infection of acute wounds [ [26](#B26-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Additionally, Moser et al. proved that the persistent inflammatory response may lead to host tissue damage, fibroblast senescence, and inhibited secretion of growth factors required for wound healing if the innate host immune system is not able to eradicate biofilm. Therefore, fighting wound biofilm, which occurs during chronic infection, involves an additional step in the immune response. At the beginning of an infection, neutrophils are recruited similarly as in the event of an acute infection, but in the process of biofilm maturation, pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., interleukins and TNF, are produced. This step takes place when the host's response becomes overwhelmed. It prevents continuous oxidative stress, supports the production of growth factors, and generally controls infection [ [27](#B27-biomedicines-11-02381), [28](#B28-biomedicines-11-02381)]. 4. Influence of Selected Essential Oils on the Immune System [29](#B29-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Many different scientific articles indicate that herbs used in traditional medicine contain various compounds demonstrating biological and therapeutic activities [ [30](#B30-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Many plants produce essential oils when subjected to stressful conditions. Essential oils have a wide range of health promoting properties, and they are also highly safe due to their low toxicity and minor side effects. [31](#B31-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The most known application of essential oils, i.e., aromatherapy, may successfully improve the quality of life of patients suffering from serious diseases, such as cancer, as it reduces anxiety and pain [ [32](#B32-biomedicines-11-02381), [33](#B33-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [34](#B34-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Essential oils may also stimulate the immune system and thus become an alternative to conventional treatment of many different diseases and other health problems, e.g., cancer, allergies, wounds, and inflammatory diseases [ [35](#B35-biomedicines-11-02381)], via the utilization of constituents of the immune system, such as antibodies, cytokines, and dendritic cells [ [36](#B36-biomedicines-11-02381), [37](#B37-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Some essential oils may stimulate the proliferation of immune-competent cells, including polymorphonuclear leukocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and B and T lymphocytes [ [38](#B38-biomedicines-11-02381), [39](#B39-biomedicines-11-02381)]. For instance, constituents of essential oils produced by Eucalyptus stimulate phagocytosis by macrophages [ [40](#B40-biomedicines-11-02381)], while Nigella sativa essential oil stops the proliferation of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes in vitro [ [41](#B41-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [42](#B42-biomedicines-11-02381)]. According to professional literature reports, essential oils may display similar or even greater immunomodulatory properties compared to conventional drugs [ [43](#B43-biomedicines-11-02381), [44](#B44-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Yet it has to be kept in mind that essential oils, if used improperly, might have some side effects. However, they are not cytotoxic if used at low concentrations [ [39](#B39-biomedicines-11-02381), [45](#B45-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [46](#B46-biomedicines-11-02381)] and a lot of new interesting data related to this subject were also published, we decided to analyze the research reports that have been published within the last 5 years. Here, we would like to present an overview of the biological properties of essential oils produced by plants that we regard as interesting, giving special consideration to their immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties ( [Figure 1](#biomedicines-11-02381-f001)). The detailed composition of all essential oils discussed in this manuscript and a summary of their influence on the immune system (activity) are presented in [Table 1](#biomedicines-11-02381-t001)at the end of the section. The influence of the most common essential oil constituents on the immune system (activity) and their chemical classification are presented in [Table 2](#biomedicines-11-02381-t002)at the end of the section. [47](#B47-biomedicines-11-02381)], as its leaves, fruits, roots, and berries display, for example, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antioxidant, anticancer, anti-diabetic, anti-mutagenic, and neuro-protective antifungal (against Candida spp., etc.) properties are widely used in traditional herbal medicine. These essential oils are rich in terpenes, terpenoids, and phenylpropanoids [ [49](#B49-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Shaapan et al. revealed the prophylactic effects of M. communis essential oils against chronic toxoplasmosis induced by the Tehran strain of Toxoplasma gondii in mice. According to the literature, toxoplasmosis is controlled by cellular immunity, so the authors evaluated the effect of the tested myrtus oil on chosen innate immunity mediators such as interferon gamma (IFN-) and IL-12 [ [50](#B50-biomedicines-11-02381)]. IL-12 and IFN-. All of these are involved in the control of the synthesis of nitric oxide, which is the initial effector in the immune system response against toxoplasmosis [ [51](#B51-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The studies showed that the IFN- and IL-12 mRNA levels were significantly higher in mice treated with essential oils when compared to the control groups. Mahmoudvand et al. proved that the mentioned essential oil is not significantly toxic at doses up to 0.4 mL/kg to BALB/c mice when administered orally for 14 days [ [52](#B52-biomedicines-11-02381)]. However, further, more advanced studies on the choice of optimal concentrations, the most active fraction or extracts, the mechanism of action, and pharmacokinetics are still needed [ [53](#B53-biomedicines-11-02381), [54](#B54-biomedicines-11-02381), [55](#B55-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [56](#B56-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The mentioned essential oil significantly suppresses the secretion of IL-25 and IL-33 from epithelial cells (critical regulators of Th2 immune responses), which may occur as a response to allergens related to the development of airway allergic inflammation, in a dose-dependent manner [ [57](#B57-biomedicines-11-02381), [58](#B58-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It also controls prostaglandins (PGs) and TNF gene expression, thus blocking LPS-induced inflammation as well as the expression and activity of nuclear-kappa B factor (NF-B) and activator protein 1 (AP-1), leading to inhibited production of IL-6 and IL-8 from bronchial epithelial cells [ [48](#B48-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Thus, it may affect innate and adaptive immune responses involved in the inflammation process. It is noteworthy that a concentration of essential oil lower than 0.1% did not affect the viability of nasal epithelial cells treated with allergens related to the development of airway allergic inflammation, and according to some authors, plain oil extracted from C. obtusa was approximately 10 times more toxic to nasal epithelial cells than its microencapsulated form [ [59](#B59-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [60](#B60-biomedicines-11-02381), [61](#B61-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Its beneficial properties have been used widely all over the world in traditional medicine, for example, in Unani, Ayurveda, Tibb, and Siddha cultures for a long time in therapies for many different diseases such as asthma, bronchitis, rheumatism, headache, back pain, paralysis, inflammation, and hypertension [ [62](#B62-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It contains many different compounds that are able to inhibit chronic inflammation and stimulate a healthy immune response. Additionally, they may affect autophagy dysfunction, oxidative stress, ischemia, inflammation, and bacterial and viral infections. Moreover, topical application of this essential oil showed an antiseptic and local anesthetic effect, as well as helping to get rid of skin blisters and eczema [ [63](#B63-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Its main constituents biologically active element is thymoquinone. According to literature reports, it is responsible for the majority of the above-mentioned properties of cumin essential oil, and its antioxidant, anticancer, and antibacterial properties were confirmed [68](#B68-biomedicines-11-02381), [69](#B69-biomedicines-11-02381), [70](#B70-biomedicines-11-02381), [71](#B71-biomedicines-11-02381), [72](#B72-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Several studies on animal models proved that the essential oil isolated from black cumin also exhibits good anti-inflammatory activity related to the presence of thymoquinone [ [73](#B73-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Hossen et al. proved that it affects the activity of pro-inflammatory factors (TNF, IL-6, Additionally, Ebrahimi et al. proved that -hederin administered at a concentration of 0.02 mg/kg in ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized rats, as in the asthma model, has an influence on IL-2 and IL-17 secretion pathways, changing miRNA-133a expression [ [71](#B71-biomedicines-11-02381), [75](#B75-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It should be pointed out that freshly extracted essential oil reduced the IL-6 level in human pre-adipocytes with low-grade inflammation, while stored oil decreased the IL-1 level [ [76](#B76-biomedicines-11-02381)]. At a concentration of 400 mg/kg, it also changed the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-12, and TNF) in rats with carrageenan-induced paw edema [ [77](#B77-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Moreover, external application of a balm stick containing 10% essential oil in rats with paw edema inhibits edema (60.64%), reduces leukocyte count (43.55% lower than control), and lowers TNF level (50% lower than control), thereby significantly reducing acute and sub-acute inflammation at the inflammation site [ [73](#B73-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Its ability to suppress inflammation is related to the activation of anti-inflammatory signaling pathways (NF-B and TLR signaling). It can stimulate immunity via one of several pathways: 1. modulation of innate as well as adaptive immune components; 2. prevention of apoptosis by upregulation of pro-survival and mTOR); 3. induction of autophagy mating information regulation 2 homologue 1 [SIRT1] signaling); 4. priming of energy metabolism (AMPK-SIRT1-PGC-1 and PPAR signaling); 5. stimulation of the growth factor pathway (PI3K/Akt signaling); 6. upregulation of lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), which leads to protein clearance [ [78](#B78-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [79](#B79-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It may also protect from neuroinflammation by inducing autophagy via activation and nuclear accumulation of SIRT1 in LPS-activated BV-2 microglia [ [80](#B80-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Moreover, by downregulating the expression of TLR signaling components and their downstream NF-B effectors and interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3), cumin essential oil increases inflammation processes in the Alzheimer's disease model [ [81](#B81-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [82](#B82-biomedicines-11-02381)] and supports the phagocytic properties of several different macrophage populations [ [83](#B83-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Koshak et al. confirmed that the essential oil extract supports the immune response by reducing IL-2, IL-6, and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in primary T-lymphocytes PGE2 monocytes, which are asthma-related inflammatory mediators [ [84](#B84-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It can also activate macrophages of [ [85](#B85-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [86](#B86-biomedicines-11-02381)]. An application of black cumin at a concentration of 10 mg/kg/day; i.p. for 14 days in combination with piperine significantly diminishes tumor size and leads to apoptosis via downregulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL-2 levels [ [78](#B78-biomedicines-11-02381), [87](#B87-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [88](#B88-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Its wide spectrum of biological activity is attributed to the presence of flavonoids and essential oils. The main constituents of the essential oil are monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and their -myrcene (2.58-18.47%), but their composition differs between the aboveground and underground parts of the plant [ [89](#B89-biomedicines-11-02381), [90](#B90-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Aboveground parts, rather than underground elements, contain 2-undecanone, myrcene, ethyl decanoate, in the antibacterial activity of essential oils isolated from chosen parts of H. cordata by some researchers relate to the composition of particular parts of this plant [ [91](#B91-biomedicines-11-02381)]. According to literature reports, the plant is able to decrease the secretion of inflammatory factors, thereby moderating lung injury and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, it may strengthen the immune barriers of the vagina, oral cavity, and intestinal tract against pathogen infection. It is able to alleviate the pathological influence of bleomycin on lung tissue [ [92](#B92-biomedicines-11-02381)] by upregulating IFN- levels and inhibiting the transforming growth factor 1 (TGF-1)/Smad signaling pathway in mice [ [93](#B93-biomedicines-11-02381), [94](#B94-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [43](#B43-biomedicines-11-02381)]. These activities are attributed to its constituents, such as thymol and eugenol, which are phenolic compounds. It must also be taken into account that the amount of constituents and especially active ingredients in T. vulgaris oil may vary depending on environmental conditions, plant harvesting seasons, and the geographical area [ [43](#B43-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The anti-inflammatory activity of essential oil extracted from T. vulgaris is probably related to its capability to diminish the production of proinflammatory cytokines [ [95](#B95-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Oca\u00f1a et al. proved that T. vulgaris EO is able to elevate inflammation via reduced secretion of inflammatory mediators such as TNF, IL-1, C-reactive protein (CRP), and IL-8, as well as an increase in anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 production processes [ [96](#B96-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Major constituents of essential oils involved in this process seem to be thymol, which affects the properties of an inflammatory process marker called elastase, produced by activated neutrophils, and inhibits cyclooxygenase (COX), as well as p-cymene, which inhibits NF-B and mitogen-activated protein [98](#B98-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It is also noteworthy that thymol and carvacrol are able to suppress the activity of transcription factors responsible for the initiation of cytokine expression in T cells, including AP-1 and nuclear factors of activated T cells (NFAT). It is also able to arrest the production of IL-2 and IFN-, thus affecting T cell activation [ [99](#B99-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Ismail et al. observed that application of essential oil from T. vulgaris to animals affected by E. coli O157:H7 significantly diminished serum IL-6, IL-8, and TNF concentrations when compared to the control group [ [8](#B8-biomedicines-11-02381), [100](#B100-biomedicines-11-02381)]. As literature reports show, thyme essential oil may also affect the synthesis of LPS-mediated nitric oxide and IFN- [ [8](#B8-biomedicines-11-02381), [101](#B101-biomedicines-11-02381)]. This observation is also worth stressing. [8](#B8-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It commonly grows in the Mediterranean region, including Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia [ [10](#B10-biomedicines-11-02381), [102](#B102-biomedicines-11-02381), [103](#B103-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It is famous antioxidant, hepatoprotective, and anti-inflammatory activities. Its application to hyperglycemia, heart diseases, inflammatory disorders, and arthritis is known in traditional medicine [ [102](#B102-biomedicines-11-02381), [104](#B104-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Moreover, it is able to improve vision and the immune system [ [105](#B105-biomedicines-11-02381), [106](#B106-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It produces essential oils, which contain, e.g., monoterpenes and cinnamic acid derivatives, known for their excellent antioxidant properties in vitro and in vivo. Hamdoon et al., among other authors, noted that they can reduce TNF and promote pro-angiogenic/anti-inflammatory TGF-1, which is involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, immune regulation, and cancer. However, it has to be pointed out that an application of this essential oil did not affect IL-1b and IL-6, which help TGF-1 in Th17 differentiation, aggravating inflammation. Additionally, the level of IL-10, a regulator of the immune response that limits the inflammatory process, was also promoted in wound healing tissue when essential oil was applied [ [9](#B9-biomedicines-11-02381), [107](#B107-biomedicines-11-02381), [108](#B108-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [9](#B9-biomedicines-11-02381)] known borneol, [110](#B110-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [111](#B111-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [112](#B112-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The main elements of the essential oil extracted from Echinacea are terpenes, such as germacrene D, and phenolic compounds [ [113](#B113-biomedicines-11-02381), [114](#B114-biomedicines-11-02381)]. According to literature reports, it helps in wound healing, supports the immune system, and diminishes respiratory problems caused by bacterial infections. It is postulated that its antimicrobial and immunomodulatory properties may be linked to each other due to synergistic effects on the host immune system. Echinacea may affect the immune system by stimulating monocytes and natural killer cells [ [112](#B112-biomedicines-11-02381), [114](#B114-biomedicines-11-02381), [115](#B115-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [116](#B116-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Its essential oils are known in folk medicine and are applied in the treatment of colds, bronchitis, and asthma [ [117](#B117-biomedicines-11-02381)]. The anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-cancerogenic properties of essential oils result from the biological activity of phenolic compounds [ during C. jejuni infection in IL-10/ mice is related to a reduced number of macrophages, monocytes, and T lymphocytes in secretion of nitric oxide, TNF, and IFN- in the intestinal tract. Additionally, in vitro studies showed that cardamom suppresses the secretion in murine splenocytes, which also appeared to be true for nitric oxide and TNF production by mouse peritoneal macrophages [ [125](#B125-biomedicines-11-02381)]. It is noteworthy that suppression of inflammatory processes in alveolar macrophages in vitro is related to the activity of 1,8-cineole, i.e., the main constituent of essential oil [ [124](#B124-biomedicines-11-02381), [126](#B126-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [127](#B127-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [32](#B32-biomedicines-11-02381), [128](#B128-biomedicines-11-02381), [129](#B129-biomedicines-11-02381)]. According to Yeh et al., the main constituents of steam-distilled essential oil, such as 2-(3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one, N,N-diphenyl-1,4-benzenediamine, benzoic acid, dipropylene glycol dibenzoate, are responsible for E. ruticarpa's anti-cancer properties. They are able to inhibit the PC-3 prostate cancer cell line by regulating Th1 (IL-2) and Th2 (IL-10) cytokine production by splenocytes (the spleen is strictly involved in immunological processes in the human body) [ [130](#B130-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Furthermore, the levels of IL-1, TNF, IL-6, and IL-10 secreted by macrophages increased. that synergistic interactions of IL-2 and IL-10 cytokines advance the CD8+ T cell cytotoxic effect, the authors concluded that the essential oil is able to support anti-cancer immunity. It may also activate natural killer (NK) cells and B cells, generating even better anti-cancer results [ [131](#B131-biomedicines-11-02381), [132](#B132-biomedicines-11-02381), [133](#B133-biomedicines-11-02381)]. According to Tahvildari et al., IL-2 treatment seems to be a promising direction to combat both autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Moreover, it has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of cancer. The PC-3 cell line is hormonally independent, so traditional hormonal therapy cannot be applied. In this case, an alternative therapy that fights cancer indirectly via immune cells might be invaluable [ [32](#B32-biomedicines-11-02381), [134](#B134-biomedicines-11-02381), [135](#B135-biomedicines-11-02381)]. [136](#B136-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Nowadays, it is also used as a support in the therapy of infectious and respiratory diseases [ [137](#B137-biomedicines-11-02381), [138](#B138-biomedicines-11-02381)]. Its main constituent, 1,8-cineole (also known as eucalyptol), as well as terpenes such -pinene and limonene, are characterized by a wide spectrum of biological activities [ [139](#B139-biomedicines-11-02381), [140](#B140-biomedicines-11-02381)]. For instance, its topical application inhibits edema and enhances vascular permeability in IgE-mediated allergic dermatitis. It may also stimulate the immune system, e.g., the immune function of the respiratory tract. It can also be used as an adjuvant in some infections and inflammatory diseases. This essential oil is able to stimulate monocyte-derived macrophage (MDM) activity in vitro [ [40](#B40-biomedicines-11-02381), [141](#B141-biomedicines-11-02381), [142](#B142-biomedicines-11-02381)]. According to Zonfrillo et al., it seems to improve the digestion process of microbial agents, e.g., the phagocytosis of zymosan particles by macrophages. Hence, it might be used as an adjuvant in the treatment of infectious and immunosuppressive diseases. It is noteworthy that pathogen internalization in this process takes place via stimulation of complement receptor (CR)-mediated phagocytosis soon after exposure to foreign microorganisms, which means that essential oils may affect the innate immune system already at the early stages of pathogen infection. It is known that this property of essential oils is attributed to the presence of eucalyptol. Nevertheless, further studies on this process are needed. The mentioned essential oil might also increase podosome density as well as augment colocalization at the podosomes of the actin core with the ring component vinculin, thereby taking part in macrophage motility and chemotaxis processes. Moreover, in the initial stages of treatment, this essential oil is able to significantly stimulate expression levels of the basic structural elements of the podosome ring: M (CD11b) and 2 (CD18) integrins, involved in control of the relation between cell and extracellular matrix in processes related to cell movement, and form together the heterodimeric complex CD11b/CD18 (or CR3) [ [2](#B2-biomedicines-11-02381)]. |Lp.||Plant Species||Activity||Main Constituents (>1%)| (The Composition of Essential Oil May Differ Depending on e.g., a Part of the Plant, Geographical Area, Season When It Was Harvested) (-Means Lack of the Peesence of the Component in Tested Material) |Literature Source| |1.||Myrtus communis| (M. communis, myrtle) |The composition of essential oil isolated from leafs of the plant grown in Jericho/Jenin/Tunisia:||[| (C. obtuse, Cupressaceae) -
