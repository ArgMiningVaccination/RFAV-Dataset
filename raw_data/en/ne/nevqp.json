Clinical Studies 1 1 OBJECTIVES OF THIS DOCUMENT 2 Clinical studies of medical interventions are conducted to provide information that can 3 ultimately improve access to safe and effective drugs with meaningful impact on patients , while 4 protecting those participating in the studies . This document focuses on designing quality into 5 clinical studies, considering the diversity of clinical study designs and data sources used to 6 support regulatory and other health policy decisions. 7 The ICH document \"General Considerations for Clinical Studies\" is intended to: 8 1. Describe internationally accepted principles and practices in the design and conduct of 9 clinical studies that will facilitate acceptance of data and results by regulatory 10 authorities 11 2. Provide guidance on the consideration of quality in the design and conduct of clinical 12 studies across the product lifecycle, including the identification during study planning 13 of factors that are critical to the quality of the study , and the management of risks to 14 those factors during study conduct 15 3. Provide an overview of the types of clinical studies performed during the product 16 lifecycle, and describe the aspects of those studies that support the determination of 17 which quality factors are critical to ensuring the protection of study subjects, the 18 integrity of the data, the reliability of results, and the ability of the stud ies to meet their 19 objectives 20 4. Provide a guide to the ICH efficacy documents to facilitate user's access ( Annex 2 and 21 3) 22 General principles of clinical study design are described in Section 2 of this document, 23 followed by a discussion of designing quality into clinical studies in Section 3 . A broad 24 overview of planning a clinical development programme , the types of studies and study 25 objectives that are important at different points in the program me, and issues of study feasibility 26 from the perspective of sponsors, investigators, regulator y authoritie s, and patients are 27 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 2 provided in Section 4. In Section 5, the elements composing study design are described. Section 28 6 describes study conduct , ensuring the safety of human subjects, and study reporting . A 29 general discussion of identifying critical to quality factors for a study is provided in Section 7 . 30 For the purposes of this document, a clinical study is meant to refer to a study of a medicinal 31 product in humans, conducted at any point in a product's lifecycle . The term \"drug\" should be 32 considered synonymous with \"medicinal product, \" including vaccines and biological products . 33 The term \" drug approval \" refers to obtaining marketing authorizatio n for the drug. 34 2 GENERAL PRINCIPLES 35 2.1 Protection of C linical S tudy S ubjects 36 Important principles of ethical conduct of clinical studies and the protection of subjects, 37 including special populations, are stated in other ICH guidelines ( ICH E6 Good Clinical 38 Practice, ICH E7 Clinical Trials in Geriatric Populations , ICH E11 Clinical Trials in the 39 Pediatric Population, and ICH E18 Genomic Sampling ). 40 These principles have their origins in t he Declaration of Helsinki and should be observed i n 41 the conduct of all human clinical investigations . The investigator and sponsor share 42 responsibility for the protection of study subjects together with the Institutional Review 43 Board /Independent Ethics Committee . 44 The confidentiality of information that c ould identify subjects should be protected in 45 accordance with the applicable regulatory and legal requirement(s). 46 Before initiating a clinical study, s ufficient information should be available to ensure that the 47 drug is acceptably safe for the planned stud y in humans . Emerging clinical and non -clinical 48 data should be reviewed and evaluated, as they become available, by qualified experts to assess 49 the potential implications for the safety of study subjects . Ongoing and future studies should 50 be appropriately adjusted as needed, to take new knowledge into consideration and to protect 51 study subjects . 52 2.2 Scientific Approach in Clinical Study Design, Conduct, and Analysis 53 Clinical studies should be designed, conducted, and analysed according to sound scientific 54 principles to achieve their objectives , and should be reported appropriately . The essence of 55 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 3 clinical research is to ask important questions and answer them with appropriate studies . The 56 primary objective of any study should be clear and explicitly stated . 57 Quality of a clinical study is considered in this document as fitness for purpose . The purpose 58 of a clinical study is to generate reliable information to answer key questions and support 59 decision making while protecting study subjects . The quality of the information generated 60 should therefore be sufficient to support good decision making . 61 Quality by design in clinical research sets out to ensure that the quality of a study is driven 62 proactively by designing quality into the study protocol and processes . This involves the use 63 of a prospective, multidisciplinary approach to promote the quality of protocol and process 64 design , and clear communication of how this will be achieved . 65 Across the product lifecycle, different types of studies will be conducted with different 66 objectives and designs . Depending on the study objectives and the position of the study in the 67 overall development plan, the data sources may vary . For purposes of this guideline, the 68 development plan is considered to cover the entire product li fecycle and includ e non-clinical, 69 clinical, and post -approval studies (Section 4) . Annex 1 provides a broad categori sation of 70 study type by objective within the different stages of drug development. 71 The cardinal logic behind serially conducted studies is t hat the results of prior studies should 72 inform the plan of later studies . Emerging data will frequently prompt a modification of the 73 development strategy . For example, results of a confirmatory study may suggest a need for 74 additional human pharmacology studies. 75 2.3 Patient Input into Study Design 76 Consulting with patient s and/or patient organisations in the design, planning and conduct of 77 clinical studies helps to ensure that all perspectives are captured . Patients' views can be 78 requested on all phases of drug development . Involving patients at the early stage of study 79 design is likely to increase trust in the study , facilitate recruitment , and promote adherence, 80 which should continue throughout the duration of the study . Patients also provide their 81 perspective of living with a condition , which contributes to the determination of endpoints that 82 are meaningful to patients , selection of the right population, duration of the study , and use of 83 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 4 the right comparators . This ultimately supports the development of medici nes that are better 84 tailored to patients' needs . 85 3 DES IGNING QUALITY INTO CLINICAL STUDIES 86 The quality by design approach to clinical research (section 3.1) involves focusing on critical 87 to quality factors to ensure the protection of study subjects, the generation of reliable and 88 meaningful results , and the management of risks to those factors (section 3.2) . The approach is 89 supported by the establishment of an appropriate framework for the identification and review 90 of critical to quality factors (section 3.3) . 91 3.1 Quality by D esign of C linical S tudies 92 Quality is a primary consideration in the design, planning , conduct and analysis of clinical 93 studies and a necessary component of clinical development progra mmes. The likelihood that a 94 clinical study will answer the research questions posed in a reliable manner, meaningful for 95 decision makers and patients, wh ile preventing important errors , can be dramatically improved 96 through prospective attention to the design of all components of the study protocol , procedures 97 and associated operational plans . 98 Quality should rely on good design and its execution rather than overreliance on retrospective 99 document checking, monitoring, auditing or inspection. These activities are an important part 100 of a quality assurance process b ut are not sufficient to ensure quality of a clinical study . 101 Good planning and implementation of a clinical study derive from attention to well- established 102 principles of clinical research , which include t he protection of the rights, safety and wellbeing 103 of study subjects and scientific criteria, such as : 104 the need for clear pre- defined study objectives that address the primary scientific 105 question(s); 106 selection of appropriate subjects that have the disease, condition, or molecular/genetic 107 profile that is being studied; 108 use of approaches to minimize bias, such as randomisation , blinding or masking , and/or 109 control of conf ounding ; 110 endpoints that are well -defined and measurable , and methods of assessment of those 111 endpoints that are accurate and able to be implemented with minimal reporting or 112 measurement bias . 113 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 5 Operational criteria are also important , such as ensuring a clear understanding of the feasibility 114 of the study , selection of suitable investigator sites, quality of specialis ed analytical and testing 115 facilities and procedures, and processes that ensure data integrity . 116 3.2 Critical to Quality Factors 117 A basic set of factors rel evant to ens uring study quality should be identified for each study . 118 Emphasis should be given to those factors that stand out as critical to study quality . These 119 critical to quality factors are attributes of a study whose integrity is fundamental to the 120 protection of study subjects, the reliability and interpretability of the study results, and the 121 decisions made based on the study results . These quality factors are considered to be critical 122 because, if their integrity were to be undermined by errors of design or conduct, the reliability 123 or ethics of decision- making would also be undermined. 124 The d esign of a clinical study should reflect the state of knowledge and experience with the 125 drug; the condition to be treated, diagnosed or prevented; the underlying biological me chanism 126 (of both the condition and the treatment) ; and the population for which the drug is intended. As 127 research progresses , knowledge increases and uncertainties about the safety and efficacy of a 128 drug decrease. 129 This state of knowledge has a clear influ ence on the regulatory and ethical controls that apply 130 to the authoris ation, supervision, and conduct of clinical studies . Knowledge of the drug at the 131 point in development when the study is designed or reviewed will therefore inform the 132 identification of critical to quality factors and control processes used to manage them. 133 The sponsor and other parties designing quality into a clinical study should identify the critical 134 to quality factors . Having identified those factors, it is important to determine the risks that 135 threaten their integrity, the probability and impact of those risks and to decide whether they 136 can be accepted or should be mitigated . Where it is decided that risks should be mitigated, the 137 necessary control processes should be put in place and communicated, and the necessary action 138 taken to mitigate the risks . The term risk is used here in the context of general risk management 139 methodology to all factors of a study. 140 Proactive communication of the critical to quality factors and risk mitigation activities will 141 support understanding of priorities and resource allocation by the sponsor and investigator 142 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 6 sites. Proactive support ( e.g., broad training to all relevant site staff and description in the 143 protocol or in the case report form) will enhance correct implementation of study protocol , 144 procedures , and associated operational plans and process design . 145 Perfection in every aspect of an activity is rarely achievable or can only be achieved by use of 146 resource s that are out of proportion to the benefi t obtained. The quality factors should be 147 prioritized to identify those that are critical to the study, at the time of the study design, and 148 study procedures should be proportionate to the risks inherent in the study and the importance 149 of the information c ollected . The critical to quality factors should be clear and should not be 150 cluttered with minor issues (e.g., due to extensive secondary objectives or processes/data 151 collection not linked to the proper protection of the study subjects and/or primary study 152 objectives). 153 3.3 Approach to I dentifying the Critical to Quality Factors 154 A key aspect of a quality approach to study design is to ask whether the objectives being 155 addressed by the study are clearly articulated ; whether the study is designed to meet the need 156 it sets out to address ; whether these needs are meaningful to patients; and whether the study 157 hypothes es are specific, timely and scientifically valid . The approach should consider whether 158 those objectives can be met, well and most efficiently, by the chosen design and data sources . 159 Study designs should be operationally feasible and avoid unnecessary complexity and 160 unnecessary data collection . Patient consultation early in the study design process contributes 161 to these f actors and would be likely to result in fewer protocol amendments . Protocols and case 162 report forms /data collection methods should enable the study to be conducted as designed . 163 Identification of critical to quality factors will be enhanced by approaches th at include the 164 following elements: 165 3.3.1 Establish ing a Culture that Supports Open Dialogue 166 Create a culture that values and rewards critical thinking and open dialogue about quali ty and 167 that goes beyond sole reliance on tools and checklists. 168 Choose quality meas ures and performance indicators that are aligned with a proactive approach 169 to design. For example, an overemphasis on minimi sing the time to first patient enrolled may 170 result in devoting too little time to identifying and preventing errors that matter thro ugh careful 171 design. 172 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 7 Encourage proactive dialogue about what is critical to quality for a particular study or 173 development program me and, when needed, the development of innovative methods for 174 ensuring quality . 175 Discourage inflexible \"one size fits all\" approaches that undermine creation of specific 176 strategies and actions intended to effectively and efficiently support quality in a given study . 177 Gather and synthesise evidence in a transparent manner, acknowledge gaps in data and 178 conflicting data where present and known, and anticipate the possible emergence of such gaps 179 or conflicts. 180 3.3.2 Focus ing on A ctivities E ssential to the Study 181 Focus effort on activities that are essential to the reliability and meaningfulness of study 182 outcomes for patients , and the safe, ethical conduct of the study for study subjects . Consider 183 whether nonessential activities may be eliminated from the study to simplify conduct, improve 184 study efficiency, and target resources to critical areas. 185 Rigorously evaluate the study design to verify that planned activities and choice of data to be 186 collected are essential . 187 Deploy resources to identify and prevent or control errors that matter . 188 3.3.3 Engaging Stakeholders in Study Design 189 Clinical s tudy design is best informed by input from a broad range of stakeholders , including 190 patients and treating physicians . It should be open to challenge by subject matter experts and 191 stakeholders from outside, as well as within, the sponsor organi sation . 192 The process of building quality into the study may be informed by participation of those 193 directly involved in successful completion of the study such as clinical investigators, study 194 coordinators and other site staff, and patients /patient organisations . Clinical investigators and 195 potenti al study subjects have valuable insights into the feasibility of enrolling subjects who 196 meet proposed eligibility criteria, whether scheduled study visits and procedures may be overly 197 burdensome and lead to early dropouts, and the general relevance of stud y endpoints and study 198 settings to the targeted patient population (See Section 4.4) . They may also provide insight into 199 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 8 the value of a treatment in the context of ethical issues, culture, region, demographics, and 200 subgroups within a targeted patient popula tion. 201 When a study has novel elements considered critical to quality (e.g., defining patient 202 populations, procedures, or endpoints), early engagement with regulatory authorities should 203 also be considered. 204 3.3.4 Review ing Critical to Quality Factors 205 Build on accumulated experience and knowledge with periodic review of critical to quality 206 factors to determine whether adjustments to risk control mechanisms are needed, since new or 207 unanticipated issues may arise once the study has begun. 208 Pay special attention to s tudies designed to include adapt ations and/or interim decision points 209 during the study . These will require proactive planning and ongoing review and adjustment of 210 critical to quality factors, and risk management . 211 4 DRUG DEVELOPMENT PLANNING 212 This section provides general principles to consider in planning a drug development 213 programme . Efficient drug development usually requires appropriately planned interactions 214 with regulatory authorities throughout development , both in relation to planning e arly as well 215 as later studies including post -approval studies . This is particularly important for multiregional 216 studies to ensure the study design is aligned with regional regulatory requirements. 217 A drug development plan describes all aspects of the develo pment of a product from the target 218 product profile through post -approval activities . The plan is usually prepared prospectively and 219 updated as the development progresses and new information becomes available . The plan 220 generally includes characteri sation of formulation development, non- clinical studies required 221 to support the evaluation of the product in human clinical studies and to support product 222 approval, clinical studies designed to support the demonstration of efficacy and safety in the 223 relevant patien t population, studies in special populations (e.g., paediatric populations), 224 regional considerations for product commerciali sation (e.g., health technology assessments), 225 and post -approval studies . 226 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 9 It is important to ensure that the experiences, perspectiv es, needs, and priorities of stakeholders 227 relating to the development and evaluation of the drug throughout its lifecycle are captured and 228 meaningfully incorporated into the development programme. 229 With increased globalisation of drug development programmes there is a need to consider 230 factors that impact quality of a protocol when it is conducted in more than one region (see ICH 231 E17 Multi -Region Clinical Trials) . Early engagement with regulatory authorities to understand 232 local/regional requirements is encouraged and will facilitate the ability to design quality into 233 the study protocol . The results of a study are often used in regulatory submissions in multiple 234 regions, and the design should also consider the relevance of the study results for regions ot her 235 than the one(s) in which the study is conducted. 236 Clinical development programme s may also feature requirements for co -development of 237 validated biomarkers, diagnostic testing, or devices that facilitate the safe and effective use of 238 a drug . 239 An overview of the types of studies that may contribute to a development programme is 240 provided in the table in Annex 1. 241 4.1 Non-Clinical Studies 242 In preparing a development plan, the non- clinical information that is required for the drug 243 should be addressed. Non- clinical information may include toxicology, carcinogenicity, 244 pharmacology , and pharmacokinetics to support clinical trials (e.g., ICH Safety (S) Guideline s 245 and M3 Nonclinical Safety Studies ). Important considerations for determining the necessary 246 non-clinical stud ies, and their timing with respect to clinical studies , depend on the 247 physiological and toxicological characteristics of the drug . These characteristics can include 248 the drug's chemical or molecular properties (e.g., small -molecule, biologic/cellular/gene 249 therapy, complex drug, and vaccine ); pharmacological basis of principal effects (mechanism 250 of action ); route(s) of administration ; absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion 251 (ADME); physiological effects on organ systems ; dose/concentration- response relationships ; 252 half-life; duration of action; and indication. Use of the drug in special populations (e.g., 253 pregnant or breast -feeding women, children, elderly ) may require additional toxicological 254 assessments. 255 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 10 Before proceeding to studies in humans, there should be sufficient information to support 256 selection of the initial human dose and safe duration of exposure, and to provide a preliminary 257 assessment of physiological and toxicological effects of the drug. 258 4.2 Quality and Formulation s of Investigational Medicinal Products 259 Quality of investigational medicinal products is an important consideration in planning a drug 260 development programme and is addressed in the ICH quality guide lines . Of particular 261 importance in transitioning from non- clinical to clinical studies is the quality of the product 262 formulation to be taken into clinical development . Formulations should be well characterised 263 in the drug development plan, including information on bioavailability . The formulation should 264 be appropriate for the stage of drug development . Ideally, the supply of a formulation will be 265 adequate to allow testing in a series of studies that examine a range of doses . During drug 266 development , different formulations of a drug may be tested . Links between formulations, 267 established by bioequivalence studies or other means , are important in interpreting clinical 268 study results across the development programme . Age-appropriate formulation development is 269 a consideration when clinical studies are anticipated in paediatric populations (ICH E11) . 270 4.3 Clinical Studies 271 Clinical drug development, defined as studying the drug in humans, is conducted in a sequence 272 that builds on knowledge accumulated from previous studies . Although clinical drug 273 development is often described as consisting of four temporal phases (Phase 1- 4), it is 274 important to appreciate that the phase concept is a description, not a set of requirements . Studies 275 may be better categorized by other design elements such as study objective (see Annex I and 276 Section 5) . It is also important to realise that the temporal phases do not imply a fixed order of 277 studies . Drug development is ideally a logical, step -wise proc ess in which information from 278 small early studies is used to support and plan later larger, more definitive studies . To develop 279 new drugs efficiently, it is essential to identify characteristics of the investigational medicine 280 in the early stages of developme nt and to plan an appropriate development based on this profile. 281 Initial studies provide an early evaluation of short -term safety and tolerability and can provide 282 pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information needed to choose a suitable dosage range 283 and administration schedule for initial exploratory studies . Later confirmatory studies are 284 generally larger and longer and include a more diverse study population. Dose response 285 information may be obtained at a ny stage of development, from early tolerance studies, to 286 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 11 studies of short -term pharmacodynamic effect, to large efficacy studies ( ICH E4 Dose - 287 Response Studies ). Throughout development, new data may suggest the need for additional 288 studies . 289 4.3.1 Human Pharmacology (usually referred to as Phase 1) 290 Clinical development begins with human pharmacology studies and includes the initial 291 administration o f an investigational new drug to humans . 292 Studies in this phase of development may be conducted in healthy volunteer subjects or in a 293 selected population of patients who have the condition or the disease , depending on drug 294 properties and the objectives of the development programme . 295 Studies typically address one or a combination of the following aspects: 296 4.3.1.1 Estimation of Initial Safety and Tolerability 297 The ini tial and subsequent administration of an investigational new drug to humans is usually 298 intended to determine the tolerability of the dose range expected to be evaluated in later clinical 299 studies and to determine the nature of adverse reactions that can be expected . These studies 300 typically include both single and multiple dose administration. 301 4.3.1.2 Pharmacokinetics 302 Characterisation of a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion continues 303 throughout the development plan, but the preliminary charact erisation is often a goal of Phase 304 1. Pharmacokinetic studies are particularly important to assess the clearance of the drug and to 305 anticipate possible accumulation of parent drug or metabolites , and potential drug -drug 306 interactions . Some pharmacokinetic s tudies are commonly conducted in later phases to answer 307 more specialised questions . For many orally administered drugs, especially modified release 308 products, the study of food effects on bioavailability is important . Obtaining pharmacokinetic 309 information i n sub- populations such as patients with impaired elimination (renal or hepatic 310 impairment), the elderly, children, and ethnic subgroups should be considered (ICH E5 Ethnic 311 Factors in the Acceptability of Foreign Clinical Data, E7, E11) . 312 If a potential for drug-drug interaction is suggested by metabolic profile, by the results of non- 313 clinical studies , or by information on similar drugs, studies on drug interaction during clinical 314 development are highly recommended and may be required to inform safe use and drug 315 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 12 labelling , especially for d rugs that are frequently co -administered . This is particularly true for 316 drugs that are known to alter the absorption or metabolism of other drugs, or whose metabolism 317 or excretion can be altered by effects of other drugs . Drug -drug interaction studies are generally 318 performed at later phases of development, but studies in animals and in vitro studies of 319 metabolism and potential interactions may inform the need for earlier studies. 320 4.3.1.3 Pharmacodynamics & Early Measurement of Drug Activity 321 Depending on the drug and the endpoint studied, pharmacodynamic studies and studies relating 322 drug levels to response (PK/PD studies) may be conducted in healthy volunteer subjects or in 323 patients with the target disease. If there is an appropriate measure, pharmacodynamic data can 324 provide early estimates of activity and potential efficacy and may guide the dosage and dose 325 regimen in later studies. 326 Preliminary studies of activity or potential therapeutic ben efit may be conducted in Phase 1 as 327 a secondary objective. Such studies are generally performed in later phases but may be 328 appropriate when drug activity is readily measurable with a short duration of drug exposure in 329 patients at this early stage. 330 4.3.2 Explorat ory and Confirmatory Studies (usually referred to as Phase 2 or Phase 3) 331 Exploratory studies (Phase 2) support clinical proof of concept for the drug in a selected 332 population of patients who have the condition or disease for which the drug is intended. If the 333 data are promising, then further clinical evaluation follows to confirm the early findings . These 334 evaluations may aim to refine the effective dose(s) and therapeutic regimens (including 335 concomitant medication) for subsequent studies, refine the defi nition of the target population, 336 provide a more robust safety profile for the drug, and may include evaluation of potential study 337 endpoints for further study . Initial exploratory studies may use a variety of study designs, 338 including concurrent controls , comparisons with baseline status , and adaptive dose -finding . 339 Other studies may involve modelling early or intermediate outcome data to predict clinical 340 outcomes and thereby inform the design of the follow -on, larger confirmatory studies . 341 Confirmatory studie s (Phase 3) are designed to confirm the preliminary evidence accumulated 342 in earlier phases that a drug is safe and effective for use for the intended indication and recipient 343 population. These studies are often intended to provide an adequate basis for mar keting 344 approval , and to support adequate instructions for use of the drug and official product 345 information . They aim to evaluate the drug in a larger population of patients with or at risk of 346 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 13 the condition or disease . These subjects more accurately represent the population of patients 347 who will receive the drug once approved and may include subgroups of patients with frequently 348 occurring or potentially relevant co -morbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hepatic 349 and renal impairment) to ch aracteri se the safe and effective use of the drug in patients with 350 these baseline conditions . 351 Confirmatory studies may further explore the dose -response relationship or explore the drug's 352 use in different stages of disease or in combination with one or more drugs. If the intent is to 353 administer a drug f or a long period , studies involving extended exposure to the drug should be 354 conducted (ICH E1 Clinical Safety for Drugs used in Long -Term Treatment ). Irrespective of 355 the duration of administration, the duration of effect of the drug will usually guide the demand 356 for understanding long -term effects and therefore the duration of follow -up in the study . 357 Confirmatory studies often use randomised parallel designs . They may use complex adaptive 358 or innovative designs to realize efficiencies or test assumptions as data accumulate during the 359 study . 360 4.3.3 Post Approval Studies ( usually referred to as Phase 4) 361 Post approval studies are studies conducted following drug approval . They may be performed 362 for a variety of reasons, including providing additional information on the efficacy, safety, and 363 use of the drug . For example, in certain circumstances, a drug may be a pproved based on 364 surrogate endpoints likely to predict clinical outcomes . After such an approval , studie s would 365 be conducted to demonstrate effects on clinical endpoints . Studies in special populations, such 366 as paediatric and elderly populations, may be conducted to understand the drug effects in these 367 populations . Safety studies may be conducted after authorization to refine the understanding of 368 potential risks . Studies with long -term follow -up or with comparisons among authorized drugs 369 may provide important information on safety and efficacy to the medical community . Post- 370 approval studies encompass a range of designs and data sources (See Section 5). 371 4.3.4 Additional Development 372 After initial approval, drug development may continue with studies of new or modified 373 indications, new dosage regimens, new routes of administration, or additional patient 374 populations . If a new dose, formulation or combination is studied, additional non-clinical 375 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 14 and/or human pharmacology studies may be indicated. Data from previous studies or from 376 clinical experience with the approved drug may inform these programme s. 377 4.3.5 Consideration in Special Populations 378 Some groups in the general population may require special study because they have unique 379 risk/benefit considerations that need to be taken into account during drug development, or 380 because they can be anticipated to need modification of the dose or schedule of a drug . ICH E5 381 provides a framework for evaluating the impact of ethnic factors on a drug's effect . Non- 382 clinical safety studies to support human clinical studies in special populations may be needed 383 (see, e.g., ICH S5 Reproductive T oxicology, S11 Nonclinical Paediatric Safety , and M3). 384 Following are examples of special populations to be considered during development planning. 385 Investigations in pregnant women 386 If a pregnant woman is enrolled in a clinical study, or a woman becomes preg nant while 387 participating in a clinical study, evaluation of the pregnancy, foetus, and child, and reporting 388 of all outcomes in the clinical study report, is often necessary . The same applies for clinical 389 studies that include pregnant women, where the medicinal product is intended for use during 390 pregnancy. 391 Investigations in nursing women 392 Excretion of the drug or its metabolites into human milk should be examined where applicable 393 and feasible . When nursing mothers are enrolled in clinical studies their babies are usually also 394 monitored for the effects of the drug. 395 Investigations in children 396 ICH E11 provides an outline of critical issues in paediatric drug development and approaches 397 to the safe, efficient, and ethical study of drugs in paediatric populations . 398 Investigations in geriatric populations 399 ICH E7 provides an outline of critical issues in geriatric drug development and approaches to 400 the safe, efficient, and ethical study of drugs in geriatric populations . 401 Investigations in renal and hepatic impaired populations 402 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 15 Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with renal and hepatic impairment are important to assess 403 the impact of potentially altered drug metabolism or excretion. 404 Particular atten tion should be paid to the ethical considerations related to informed consent in 405 vulnerable populations (ICH E6 and E11). 406 4.4 Feasibility 407 During drug development, the feasibility of the individual studies should be assessed. The 408 foundation of a successful stud y is a protocol that is both scientifically sound and operationally 409 viable . A detailed feasibility assessment includes consideration of study design and 410 implementation elements that could impact the successful completion of a clinical development 411 programme or study from an operational perspective in a particular geographical region. 412 Consideration of critical to quality factors relating to study feasibility can inform study design 413 and enhance quality implementation. Feasibility considerations include but ar e not limited to 414 the availability of qualified investigators/site personnel with experience in conducting a clinical 415 study; availability of equipment and facilities required to successfully conduct the clinical 416 study; availability of the desired patient po pulation; ability to enrol sufficient numbers of 417 participants as determined by the study's power analysis; the ethical and regulatory 418 considerations, which include informed consent, parental/caregiver consent and patient assent 419 for paediatric studies ; and regional standards of care. 420 An important aspect of study feasibility is understanding the view of potential study subjects 421 about protocol elements that could impact their willin gness to enrol or continue participation 422 in the study (e.g., impact of stu dy procedures, meaningfulness of the study 423 objectives/outcomes) . The retention of study subjects and the follow -up of subjects who have 424 withdrawn from treatment are key critical to quality factors . It is important to not underestimate 425 the value that appropriate and early consultation with patients will have on the feasibility of 426 the study , adherence to the protocol , and, more essentially , relevance (or suitability) for patients 427 of the drug approval based on the accumulated knowledge and experience from the clinical 428 studies . 429 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 16 5 DESIGN ELEMENTS FOR CLINICAL STUDIES 430 Study objectives impact the choice of study design and data sources, which in turn impact the 431 strength of a study to support regulatory decisions and clinical practice . This section presents 432 important elements that define the design of a clinical study . It is intended to assist in 433 identifying the critical to quality factors necessary to achieve the study objectives and the 434 protection of study subjects, while also enabling flexibility in study design and promoting 435 efficiency in study conduct . This document does not discuss all possible study types that may 436 be included within the drug lifecycle. The elements outlined here are expected to be relevant 437 to study types and data sources in use in clinical studies now, and that may be developed in the 438 future . 439 Clear objectives will help to determine the study design and conversely, the process of 440 specifying the design may help to further clarify the objectives . Objectives may need to be 441 modified as practical considerations and limitations are revealed. 442 5.1 Study Design 443 The fundamental design elements of a clinical study include population, intervention, control 444 group, response variable, methods to reduce or assess bias, and statistical a nalysis . The protocol 445 brings these elements together with the study objectives, study type, and data sources (see 446 Section 5.2) , and should be finali sed before the start of the study (see ICH E6) . 447 5.1.1 Study Population 448 The population to be studied should be chosen to support the study objectives and is defined 449 through the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study . In practice, the study population is 450 limited to subjects available to participate and for whom consent is available (see ICH E6) . 451 Recruitment efforts should ensure that the study subjects reflect the planned population for the 452 study . If objectives include obtaining information on certain subgroups, then efforts should be 453 made to ensure adequate representation of these subgroups . 454 The study population might be narrowly defined to reduce heterogeneity and maximize the 455 sensitivity of the study for detecting a certain effect . Conversely, it may be broadly defined to 456 more closely represent the population for which the drug is intended. In general, studies 457 conducted early in a dev elopment programme , when little is known about the safety of the 458 drug, tend to be more homogeneous in study population definitions, and those conducted in the 459 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 17 later phases of drug development or post -approval tend to be more heterogeneous . Recruitment 460 for a precision medicine study, for example, may target the subgroup of diseased patients with 461 a particular phenotype or genotype, either exclusively or through an enrichment study design. 462 The choice of study population will depend on the study objectives, and the degree to which a 463 study succeeds in recruiting and enrolling the desired population will impact the ability of the 464 study to meet those objectives. 465 For example, a study population representative of clinical practice may be the target of a 466 pragmatic trial conducted within an existing healthcare system . In such a study, recruitment 467 procedures may differ from other types of studies, in that the inclusion and exclusion criteria 468 may be assessed based on existing medical records. 469 Because of the study objectives or because of feasibility or efficiency, there may be situations 470 in which the population unit is not an individual but a group of subjects (known as a cluster) . 471 For example, some vaccine studies make use of cluster randomi sation to measure their 472 protective effects on communities . The use of a cluster unit has implications for multiple design 473 elements and quality factors (e.g., intervention, analysis, consent) . 474 The study should plan to have a sufficient number of subjects to make statistical conc lusions 475 based on the findings either by obtaining a certain precision or by controlling the probabilities 476 of mak ing false conclusions ( see ICH E9 Statistical Principles for Clinical Trials ). A larger 477 database may be needed to establish the safety of a drug (see ICH E1). 478 5.1.2 Intervention 479 An important distinction between studies is whether the choice of the study drug and the health 480 management of the subjects are controlled by the study (with proper regard to human subject 481 protection and regulatory requirements ) or merely observed in the study . The former case is 482 referred to as an interventional study and the latter case is referred to as an observational study . 483 Interventional studies often have the potential to control biases better than observational studies 484 (see Section 5.1.5) . Factors such as study objectives, feasibility, data sources, and anticipated 485 biases and uncertainty play a role in the choice between interventional and observational 486 studies . Observational studies are usually conducted in the post -approval period. 487 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 18 There is varying overlap between interventional and observational studies . For example, a 488 pragmatic trial is a mix of the two types in that the intervention is controlled by the study, but 489 health management is controlled to a lesser degree than in other study types . 490 5.1.3 Control Group 491 The drug effect of interest may be the effect relative to not receiving the drug or the effect 492 relative to receiving other therapies . For example, comparisons may be made with placebo, no 493 treatment, active controls or different doses of the drug under investigation. To derive these 494 comparisons, information on a group of subjects not receiving the drug or receiving other 495 therapies is usually needed . This group is known as the control group (see ICH E10) . The 496 choice of a control group may be influenced by the study objectives, ethical considerations, 497 and study feasibility . 498 The source of control group data may be internal or external to the study . With use of an internal 499 control group, all subjects in the study are selecte d by the same processes, and data are acquired 500 by the same procedures at the same time, with the intent that the only differences observed 501 among subjects in the study are due to the treatment they receive . With use of an external 502 control group, subjects ar e selected from an external source, and the control group subjects 503 may be treated at an earlier time (historical control group) or during the same time but in 504 another setting than subjects in the study . 505 External control subjects may differ from subjects participating in the study with respect to 506 follow -up and measurement of study outcomes and other data elements . In addition, external 507 control subjects may differ from study subjects with respect to some demographic and 508 background characteristics (e.g., medi cal history, concurrent diseases, etc.), possibly reflecting 509 a somewhat different subject population, which should be taken into account in the design and 510 analysis of the study . 511 It may be possible for a single clinical study to use both internal and exter nal control subjects . 512 For example, conduct of the study may be facilitated by supplementing the internal control 513 group with additional data on an external control group. 514 In some circumstances, rather than using a separate group of control subjects, subjec ts may 515 function as their own control receiving the drug and control at different points of time . Both 516 interventional and non- interventional studies may make use of such an approach. Examples of 517 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 19 this approach include crossover designs for interventional studies and case -crossover designs 518 for non- interventional studies . 519 There are critical to quality factors that are associated with the choice and use of the control 520 group, including study objective, availability and quality of control data, feasibility of 521 conducting the study, ethical considerations, comparability between treatment and control 522 populations, and comparability of outcome ascertainment. 523 Subject level data may not be available for some choices of external control groups, but if 524 summary measures are available from the external source, they may be used to form the basis 525 of comparisons with treated subjects to estimate and test hypotheses about drug effects . In this 526 case, however, the critical to quality factor of comparability between treatment groups is unable 527 to be addressed through adjustment for subject -level covariates . 528 When control data considered adequate to support comparisons are not available, responses to 529 treatment observed in the study may be compared to a relevant and justified target val ue for 530 the control response rate (e.g., tumour response rate in oncology; cure rate for anti -infectives) . 531 Even in cases where comparable control data are available, an external target value may still 532 be useful in evaluating the response rate observed in the study. 533 5.1.4 Response Variables 534 A response variable is a subject -level attribute of interest that may be affected by the drug . The 535 respons e variable may relate to the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, or 536 use of the drug post -approval including compliance with risk minimisation measures . Study 537 endpoints are the response variables that are chosen to assess drug effects . 538 The choice of primary endpoint is critical to the quality of the study . The primary endpoint 539 should be the variable c apable of providing the most clinically relevant and convincing 540 evidence directly related to the primary objective of the study , taking into account feasibility 541 considerations (ICH E9) . Secondary variables are either supportive measurements related to 542 the primary objective or measurements of effects related to the secondary objectives . The 543 choice of endpoints should be meaningful for the intended population and take into account the 544 views of patients. 545 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 20 The definition of each study endpoint should be specific . The specificity should include how it 546 is ascertained and at what time point in a subject's treatment course of the drug and follow -up 547 it is ascertained . The methods used to ascertain endpoints should be of sufficient accuracy, 548 precision, responsiveness ( sensitivity to change), reproducibility, reliability, and validity . 549 Pragmatic trials may make use of existing data from healthcare systems to obtain response 550 variables rather than through study specific data collection , similar to the way healthcare data 551 can be used to select the study population as describe d abo ve (See Sec 5.1.1) . 552 The knowledge of the drug, the clinical context , and the purpose of a given study affect what 553 response variables should be collected . For example, a proof -of-concept study may employ 554 short -term surrogates rather than objective clinical outcomes . Clinical outcomes would then be 555 used to confirm a clinical ly meaningful effect in a large- scale confirmatory study . In other 556 cases, for example, a post-approval study where the safety profile of the drug is well 557 characteri sed, the extent of safety data collection may be tailored to the objectives of the study . 558 5.1.5 Methods to Reduce or Assess Bias 559 The study design should address sources of bias that can undermine the reliabilit y of results . 560 Although different types of studies are subject to different sources of bias, this section 561 addresses the more common sources . ICH E9 discusses principles for controlling and reducing 562 bias mainly in the context of interventional studies . 563 In conducting a controlled study , randomised allocation is the preferred means of assuring 564 comparability of test groups, thereby minimising the possibility of bias in treatment 565 assignment . 566 Randomisation addresses differences between the groups at the time of randomi sation but does 567 not prevent differences arising after randomisation. Events after randomi sation (intercurrent 568 events) may also affect the comparability of the groups . For example, there may be differences 569 in the follow -up patterns between the groups , such as subjects in one group dropping out of the 570 study because of adverse events or lack of efficacy . Careful consideration of the potential 571 impact of intercurrent events will help with the identification of critical to quality factors , such 572 as preventi ng dropouts, retrieving data for dropouts, and definition of treatment effect in the 573 presence of dropouts. 574 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 21 Concealing the treatment assignments (blinding or masking) limits the occurrence of conscious 575 or unconscious bias in the conduct and interpretation of a clinical study that may affect the 576 course of treatment, monitoring, endpoint ascertainment, and subject responses . A study where 577 the treatment assignment is not known by the study participant is referred to as a single- blind 578 study . When the investigator and sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or clinical 579 evaluation of the subjects are also unaware of the treatment assignments, the study is double - 580 blind. Maintaining confidentiality of interim study results also can help to reduce bias. 581 In an open -label study (either single -arm or un blinded comparative), the consequences of the 582 lack of blinding may be reduced through the use of pre -specified decision rules for aspects of 583 study conduct, such as treatment assignment, subject management , safety reporting, and 584 response variable ascertainment . 585 Observational studies pose unique challenges to the control of bias . Multiple design elements 586 are often necessary to address these challenges, including methods to address biases associated 587 with the (1) selection of subjects, (2) differences in prognostic factors associated with the 588 choice of therapies (confounding), and (3) ascertainment of response variables and other 589 important study variables . 590 5.1.6 Statistical Analysis 591 The statistical analysis of a study encompasses important elements necessary to achieving the 592 study objectives . The study protocol should include a statistical methods section that is 593 appropriate for the objectives and study design ( ICH E6 and E9) . A separate statistical analysis 594 plan may be used to provide the necessary details for implementation . The protocol should be 595 finalis ed before the conduct of the study, and the statistical analysis plan should be finali sed 596 before the unblinding of study data, or in the case of an open- label study, before the conduct 597 of the study . These steps will increase confidence that important aspects of analysis planning 598 were not based on accumulating data in the study or inappropriate use of external data, both of 599 which can negatively impact the reliability of study results . For example, the choice of analysis 600 methods in a randomised clinical trial should not change after examining unblinded study data, 601 and external co ntrol subjects should not be selected based on outcomes to be used in 602 comparative analyses with treated study subjects. 603 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 22 Statistical analyses of primary and secondary endpoints to achieve study objectives with 604 respect to both efficacy and safety should be described, as well as any interim analyses and/or 605 planned design adaptations (E9) . The analysis plan should describe the analytical methods for 606 the estimation and tests of hypotheses about the drug effect , addressing the method of treatment 607 allocation, the measurement methods of response variables, the analysis population, and other 608 critical to quality factors relating to the planned analysis strategy appropriate for the study 609 design . The plan should address the handling of intercurrent events, such as treat ment 610 discontinuations, use of rescue medication, missed visits, and other protocol violations . 611 The statistical analysis plan should describe how the various sources of bias discussed above 612 will be addressed in the context of the particular study design and data sources (see Section 613 5.1.5) . 614 Pre-specification is particularly important for studies that make use of existing data sources 615 rather than primary data collection (see Section 5.2) , not only for the statistical analysis plan ned 616 for the study but also for any feasibility analysis to assess the applicability of the existing data. 617 For example, for a single arm interventional study with an external control, the specifics of the 618 external control should be specified prior to the conduct of the interventional aspect of the 619 study . Assurances and procedures should be in place so that any review of the data prior to the 620 design of the study does not threaten the study integrity . 621 Sensitivity analyses should be planned to test the impact of the assumptions made for the 622 primary analyses on the results of the study . For example, if the primary analys is relies on a 623 particular assum ption about the reasons data are missing , sensitivity analys es should be planned 624 to assess the impact of th ose assum ptions on the study results . An example for observational 625 studies might be consideration of additional confounders . 626 5.2 Study Data 627 The study data should reliably contain the necessary information to conduct, monitor, and 628 analyse the study . The study data may be acquired through a variety of methods, including 629 paper -based and electronic capture. Data from the use of technologies (e.g., digital health 630 tools), electronic health record databases and patient registries may contribute to the 631 development of a new inv estigational drug or for further evaluation of an approved drug . 632 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 23 Study data can be broadly classified into two types : (1) data generated specifically for the 633 present study and (2) data obtained from sources external to the present study . The distinction 634 between the two types may not always be clear . For example, clinical study data may be 635 collected during scheduled study visits via case report forms, laboratory measurements, and 636 other mechanisms, while also including information obtained from existing medi cal records . 637 Data from both types of data sources comprise the clinical database in this case . 638 The term primary data collection , refers to data collected for study purposes using processes 639 that ensure a sufficient level of quality . The term secondary data use, refers to the use of data 640 that were collected for other purposes and are not collected just for the study . Note that 641 secondary data themselves may have had careful quality control processes implemented during 642 their acquisition, but those processes we re not designed with the objectives of the present study 643 in mind . Examples of secondary data sources that might be used in clinical studies include 644 national death databases, disease and drug registries, claims data, and medical and 645 administrative records f rom routine medical practice . 646 With secondary data use, the appropriateness of the available data should be considered. For 647 example, when using existing electronic health record data to ascertain the study endpoint 648 rather than through primary data collecti on, information in the health record about outcomes 649 would need to be converted to the study endpoint . The sensitivity, specificity, and timing of 650 the outcomes in the record should be considered . In some cases, secondary data use may not 651 be sufficient for a ll aspects of the study and may need to be supplemented with primary data . 652 There are several additional considerations when using secondary data . Concealing the drug 653 name in the measurement and recording of data is typically not present in secondary data use. 654 Absence of affirmative information on a condition or event does not necessarily mean the 655 condition is not present . For example, absence of smoking status in a medical record may not 656 mean the patient is not a smoker . There also may be a delay between events and their presence 657 in existing data sources . 658 The use of data standards for the terminology, storage, exchange, and access of study data 659 promotes the reliability and the proper interpretation of the data . Data standards also facilitate 660 the ease and correctness of the data analysis . International data standards exist for many sources 661 of study data . Data standards should be developed for emerging sources of study data . 662 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 24 For all data sources, procedures to ensure the confidentiality of personal data should be 663 implemented . The study design should explicitly address the protection of personal data . Local 664 regulations related to privacy of participants' data should be followed. 665 6 CONDUCT AND REPORTING 666 6.1 Study Conduct 667 The principles and approaches set out in this guideline, including those of quality by design, 668 should inform the approach taken to the conduct and reporting of clinical studies and the 669 proportionality of control measures employed to ensure the integrity of the critical to quality 670 factors . The study s hould be conducted according to the principles described in this guideline 671 and in accordance with ICH E6 and other relevant ICH guidelines (see Annex 2 and Annex 3). 672 6.1.1 Protocol Adherence 673 Adherence to the study protocol is essential, and many aspects of adhe rence should be 674 considered among the study's critical to quality factors . If modification of the protocol becomes 675 necessary, a clear description of the rationale for the modification should be provided in a 676 protocol amendment (ICH E6) . 677 6.1.2 Training stak eholders, such sponsors ; investigators, coordinators, and other local site staff; site 679 monitors; adjudicators and members of the data monitoring committee; and third -party service 680 providers (e.g., central laboratory or reading centre personnel) should receive thorough training 681 prior to enrolment of the first study subject. U pdated training should occur during the conduct 682 of the study to reinforce the importance of adherence to study procedures and to address issues 683 related to critical to quality factors observed during the course of the study. 684 6.1.3 Data M anagement 685 As discussed in ICH E6, the manner and timelines in which study data are collected and 686 managed are critical contributors to overall study quality . Operational checks and statistical 687 surveilla nce can identify important data quality issues at a point at which corrective action is 688 feasible. Data management procedures should account for the diversity of data sources in use 689 for clinical studies (see Section 5.2) . 690 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 25 6.1.4 Access to Interim D ata 691 Inappropriate access to data during the conduct of the study may compromise study integrity . 692 In studies with planned interim analyses, special attention should be given to which individuals 693 have access to the data and results . Even in studies without planned interim analyses, special 694 attention should be paid to any ongoing monitoring of data to avoid inappropriate access. 695 6.2 Subject Safety 696 Important standards of ethical conduct and the protection of subjects in clinical studies are 697 described in Section 2.1. This section describes safety related considerations during the conduct 698 of the study. 699 6.2.1 Safety Monitoring 700 The goals of safety monitoring are to protect study subjects and to characterize the safety 701 profile of the drug . Procedures and systems for the identifica tion, monitoring, and reporting of 702 safety concerns including the timing of reporting during the study should be clearly specified. 703 The approach should reflect the risks to the study subjects and what is known about the drug 704 and the study population. Guidance is available on reporting of safety data to appropriate 705 authorities and on the content of safety reports [ ICH E2 Pharmacovigilance ( A, B, and D), and 706 ICH E6 ]. 707 6.2.2 Withdrawal C riteria 708 Clear criteria for stopping study treatment while remaining in the s tudy or withdrawing from 709 the study al together are necessary to ensure the protection of the subjects; however, 710 consideration could be given to methods that will preserve subjects' safety and rights while 711 still minimis ing loss of critical data , if possible . 712 6.2.3 Data M onitoring C ommittee 713 An important component of safety monitoring in many clinical studies is the use of a data 714 monitoring committee (DMC) . A DMC monitors accumulating data while the study is being 715 conducted to make determinations on whether to conti nue, modify, or terminate a study . 716 During programme planning, the need for an external safety monitoring committee to monitor 717 safety data across studies in a development programme may also be assessed . If a data 718 monitoring committee is needed for either a n individual study or the entire development 719 ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 26 programme , procedures governing its operation and, in particular, the review of unblinded data 720 while preserving study integrity (ICH E9) should be established. 721 6.3 Study Reporting 722 Clinical study reports should be adequately documented following the approaches outlined in 723 other ICH guidelines . ICH E3 focuses particularly on the report format for interventional 724 clinical studies . Other types of studies (e.g., observational studies) should use reporting formats 725 appropr iate for the type of study and information being reported. 726 The transparency of clinical research in drug development includes the registration of clinical 727 trials on publicly accessible and recogni sed databases, and the public posting of clinical trial 728 results. Adopting such practices for observational studies also promote s transparency . Making 729 objective and unbiased information publicly available can benefit public health in general, as 730 well as individual patient populations, through enhancing clinical res earch, reducing 731 unnecessary clinical studies and informing decisions in clinical practice. 732 7 CONSIDERATIONS IN IDENTIFYING CRITICAL TO QUALITY FACTORS 733 The identification of critical to quality factors should be supported by proactive, cross - 734 functional discus sions and decision making at the time of study planning, as described in 735 Section 3 . Different factors will stand out as critical for different types of studie s, following 736 the concepts introduced in Sections 4 t hrough 6. 737 In designing a study, applicable aspects such as the following should be considered to support 738 the identification of critical to quality factors : 739 Engagement of all relevant stakeholders, including patients, is considered during 740 study planning and design. 741 The prerequisite non- clinical stud ies, and where applicable, clinical studies, are 742 complete and adequate to support the study being designed. 743 The study objectives address r elevant scientific question s appropriate for a given 744 study's role in the development programme , taking into account the accumulated 745 knowledge about the product. 746 The clinical study design support s a meaningful comparison of the eff ects of the 747 drug when compared to the chosen internal or external control groups. 748 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 27 Adequate measures are used to protect subjects' rights, safety , and welfare 749 (informed consent process, Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee review, 750 investigator and clinical study site training, pseudonymisation, etc.) . 751 A feasibility assessment is conducted to ensure the study is operationally viable. 752 The number of subjects included, the duration of the study , and the frequency of 753 study visits are sufficient to support the study objective. 754 The eligibility criteria should be reflective of the study objectives and be well 755 documented in the clinical study protocol . 756 Information about study subjects that may be important to understanding the 757 benefit/risk of the drug (e.g., age, weight, sex, co- morbidities, concomitant 758 therapies) is specified in the protocol , captured and incorporated in the design , 759 conduct, and analysis, as appropriate. 760 The choice of response variables and the methods to assess them are well -defined 761 and support evaluation of the effects of the drug . 762 Clinical study procedures include adequate measures to minimi bias (e.g., 763 randomi sation, bl The statistical analysis plan is pre -specified and defines the analysis methods 765 appropriate for the endpoints and the populations of interest . 766 Systems and process es are in place to ensure the integrity of critical study data. 767 The extent and nature of study monitoring are tailored to the specific study design 768 and objectives and the need to ensure subject safety. 769 The need for a data monitoring committee is assessed . 770 These considerations are not exhaustive and may not apply to all studies . Other aspects may 771 need to be considered to identify the critical to quality factors for each individual study. 772 ICH E8(R1) draft Guideline 29 ANNEX 1: TYPES OF STUDIES 773 Drug development is ideally a logical, step -wise process in which information from small early 774 studies is used to support and plan later larger, more definitive studies . In the table below, types 775 of studies are categorized by objective s. Illustrative examples, not intended to be exhaustive, 776 are provided . Examples appearing under one type may also occur under another. 777 Type of Study Objective (s) of Study Study Examples Non-clinical testing to support and supplement clinical investigations Assess non -clinical PK4 /PD5 Assess toxic ity Assess developmental toxicity Assess mutagenicity, carcinogenicity Assess immunogenicity and cross - reactivity Understand target and mechanism of action AMES1 test ADME2 studies Animal carcinogenicity Mechanism of action investigations in animal disease models Animal toxic ology Animal PK/PD Human Pharmacolog y Assess tolerance and safety Define/describe clinical PK and PD Explore drug metabolism and drug interactions Estimate activity, immunogenicity Assess renal/hepatic tolerance Assess cardiac toxicity BA/BE3 studies under fasted/fed conditions Dose -tolerance studies Single and multiple -rising dose PK and/or PD studies Drug -drug interaction studies QTc prolongation s tudy Exploratory Explore use for the targeted indication Estimate dose/dosing regimen for subsequent studies Explore dose-response/exposure - response relationship Provide basis for confirmatory study design (e.g., clinical endpoints, patient reported outcome measures, effect modifiers, target population, etc.) Randomized controlled clinical trials of relatively short duration in well - defined narrow patient populations, using surrogate or pharmacological endpoints or clinical measures Dose finding studies Biomarker exploration studies Studies to validate patient reported outcome s Confirmatory Demonstrate/confirm efficacy Establish safety profile in larger, more representative patient populations Provide an adequate basis for assessing the benefit/risk relationship to support licensing Establish dose -response/exposure - response relationship Randomized controlled clinical t rials to establish efficacy in larger, more representative patient populations , commonly employing clinical endpoints but may also use surrogate or pharmacological endpoints Dose-response studies Clinical safety studies Studies of mortality/morbidity outcomes ICH E8(R1) daft Guideline 30 Establish safety profile and confirm efficacy in specific populations (e.g., paediatrics, elderly) Studies in special populations Post- Approval Refine understanding of benefit/risk relationship in general or special populations and/or environments Identify less common adverse reactions Refine dosing recommendations Comparative effectiveness studies Long-term follow -up studies Studies of additional endpoints Large, simple trials Pragmatic trials Pharmacoeconomic studies Observational studies 1 AMES: mutagenicity test 2 ADME : Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion 3 BA studies - Bioavailability means the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety is absorbed from a drug product and becomes available at the site of action . 3 BE studies - Bioequivalence means the absence of a significant difference in the rate and extent to which the active ingredient or active moiety in pharmaceutical equivalents or pharmaceutical alternatives become available at the site of drug action when administered at the same mol ar dose under similar conditions in an appropriately designed study. 4 Pharmacokinetics 5 Pharmacodynamics 778 ICH E8(R1) Guideline 31 ANNEX 2: ICH E FAMILY OF GUIDELINES 779 The ICH Efficacy guidelines are an integrated set of guidance covering the design, conduct, analysis and reporting of clinica l studies. ICH E8 780 provides an overall introduction to clinical development, designing quality into clinical studies and focusing on those factors critical to the quality 781 of the studies. The guidelines should be considered and used in an integrated, holistic way rather than one or other guideline or subsection being 782 focussed on in isolation of the others. 783 784 *This diagram will be updated as new ICH guidelines are finalized or updated. 785 ICH E8(R1) Guideline 32 ANNEX 3: SELECTED EXAMPLES OF CRITICAL TO QUALITY FACTORS 786 Selected Examples of Critical to Types of Controls Data Qua lity Endpoints Procedures Supporting Study Endpoints and Data Integrity Investigational Product (IP) Handling and Administration Feasibility Study and Site Feasibility Accrual Patient Safety Informed Consent Withdrawal Criteria and Trial Participant Retention ICH E8(R1) Guideline 33 Selected Examples of Critical to Safety Reporting (B) Data Monitoring Committee (DMC)/Stopping Rules Study Conduct Training Data Recording and Reporting (B,C,F) Data Monitoring and Management (A,B,D) Statistical Analysis Study Reporting Dissemination of Study Results (D,F) Third -Party Engagement Delegation of Sponsor Responsibilities Collaborations *This chart will be updated as ICH guidelines are finalized or updated. 787 "}
