The pose involves lying on your back with your arms and legs fully extended and relaxed, allowing your body to completely surrender to the ground. Savasana is often used as the final pose in a yoga practice and is considered one of the most important poses for promoting deep relaxation and rejuvenation. During this pose, the body is completely still, allowing the mind and body to completely let go of tension and stress. Relaxation and detox meditation is a form of mindfulness meditation that involves focusing on relaxation and the elimination of toxins from the body. This type of meditation may involve deep breathing, visualization, and self-reflection to help release mental and physical tension and promote a sense of well-being. Savasana can be used in conjunction with relaxation and detox meditation to create a powerful experience of deep relaxation and rejuvenation. By allowing the body to completely let go of tension and stress, the body is able to naturally eliminate toxins, promote deep relaxation, and cultivate inner peace and harmony.
