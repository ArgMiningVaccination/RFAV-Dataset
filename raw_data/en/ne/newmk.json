Over 6000 years old, Ayurveda (which translates as \"knowledge of life\") is a highly sophisticated health science; the ancient texts distinguished between two types of diabetes and described the circulatory system thousands of years before such knowledge was developed in the West.", "sitename": "The Raj", "date": "2018-05-15", "cleaned_text": "Individualized Panchakarma Treatments Each guest receives an individually prescribed combination of treatments designed to bring about balance and rejuvenation. A typical day may include a two-technician, synchronized herbalized oil massage, an herbalized steam treatment, and gentle elimination therapy. Treatments will vary from day-to-day. Possible treatments include: Herbalized Oil Application (abhyanga) A comprehensive and soothing oil massage carried out in synchrony by a team of two technicians. The oil application uses herbalized oils prescribed to suit your individual needs. The treatment promotes the penetration of oil deep into the tissues so that impurities are loosened and separated from the cell structure. Herbalized Steam Treatment (swedena) Using a special heat chamber that allows the head to remain cool, this herbalized steam bath opens up the channels of the body and allows the loosened impurities to move into the digestive tract in readiness for their removal by internal cleansing procedures. Relaxation Treatment (shirodhara) A soothing continuous flow of herbalized oil poured slowly and gently across the forehead, this treatment settles and balances the nervous system. The effect is delightful and many guests experience profound relaxation during the treatment. Nourishing Therapy (pindaswedena) During this treatment the entire body is massaged using a mixture of milk, oils, herbs, and rice. This procedure is particularly helpful in relieving pain, stiffness and inflammation. Luxury Oil Treatment (pizzichilli) In this luxurious treatment two technicians use a constant flow of warm herbalized oil to give the ultimate experience of deep relaxation. The oil penetrates deeply into the bodily tissues, softening and mobilizing impurities. Stimulating Circulation Treatment (udvartana) Using herbalized paste, this stimulating treatment helps to enliven and revitalize the skin, smooth away fat deposits and improve circulation and digestion. Elimination Therapy (basti) Daily gentle oil enemas eliminate impurities that have been moved into the intestinal tract as a result of the other treatments. Elimination Therapy removes all types of imbalances, and is considered a vital part of this cleansing process. Oils We use only the best and purest oils; cold pressed with no chemical additives. All of your treatments are specially prepared for you in our herb kitchen using only the highest quality herbs. "}
