Read the whole story", "sitename": "Ars OpenForum", "date": "2021-03-03", "cleaned_text": "It's quite a relief knowing that the President of the United States can go about his job like a competent grown adult, instead of making the world wonder \"What will this moron say today?\" Finally back to sanity. ...and great news for the vaccination for all. In other news, Texas has lifted all COVID restrictions. It's like an arms race, but with biological weapons already deployed. Also, the Merck contribution to the 'fill and finish' part of the pipeline will be available faster; I saw estimates of around six or so weeks being tossed around earlier today. Before all of this started, I never would have guessed that 'put the vaccine in all the little vials' would have been anywhere near a rate-limiting step, but live and learn I guess.I saw somewhere else today that Merck will not be online in time to help boost J&J's output until around June. Is the new end of May timeline really a result of the Merck boost or is it just the fact that the end of July timeline didn't include J&J at all since it didn't have an EUA yet when Biden announced end of July? I think that's maybe too simplistic a way of looking at it. Starting immediately, Merck will help J&J get supplies they need immediately, J&J was contracted to deliver 100M doses by end of June, but they didn't think they'd actually be able to hit that deadline due to a lack of supplies. Merck will provide those supplies, possibly at the expense of their own production of other drugs. They were probably also stockpiling those supplies as they expected to have their own vaccine but cancelled it in Jan. In return, they'll get to produce some vaccine and sell it internationally. I mean, it's pretty clear that a big part of this mobilization effort is to get the US vaccinated so that US drug companies can take advantage of the 7B dose global demand. This is not just good for US citizens, but also the US economy, and global health. I'm certain if Biden had been president at the start of 2020, we'd have committed the nation to developing a vaccine and producing enough for the planet. Because, why wouldn't you want the US to have that honor? Considering that all the steps in that 'put the vaccine in all the little vials' have to be kept sterile, and involves capping the vials, labeling and boxing them, and providing the associated lot number documentation*, I'm not surprised. *(Every shot someone gets has to be traceable to a batch number. The immunization card you get has a sticker on it with that info. This is for follow up in case of problems. It's not like bottling soft drinks.) Actually, food manufacturing has traceability requirements, too. In the US, the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) requires keeping records to ensure that a package of food can be traced back to a particular batch of raw ingredients. It's been several years since I had to do anything with it, but I think GS1 has some global traceability standards for food. There are more stringent guidelines for pharmaceuticals, but the major difference is the level of cleanliness required to prevent contamination (e.g. a few grams of salt or a little extra protein won't ruin a batch of bread, but could definitely ruin a batch of drugs in a chemical reactor). Yeah, I think the biggest issue I have is that all the data shows J&J vaccine is only roughly 64% effective. I'm sorry, but if I still have over a 33% chance of contacting covid-19, along with all the possibly lifetime health issues from it, even with your vaccine, it's basically worthless. What it'll do is make a shit load of people become careless thinking they're safe from it, just to find out that they can still catch it. Why are we focusing on trying to mass produce J&J when we have two other proven vaccines with SIGNIFICANTLY higher effectiveness already? At this point, based on the data published it looks like Pfizer is the front runner. So rather than back what kinda looks like a cash grab by J&J for a sub par vaccine that basically doesn't really work, why not try to help Pfizer ramp up production on the significantly more effective one? \"With a White House-brokered deal...\" Source on this? I was under the impression that J&J did this on their own. "}
