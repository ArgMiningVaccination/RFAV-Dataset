Background . Depression is a major reason for counselling in primary care. Our study aims at evaluating pharmacological treatment strategies among physicians specialised in anthroposophic medicine (AM). Methods . From 2004 to 2008, twenty-two German primary care AM-physicians participated in this prospective, multicentre observational study. Multiple logistic regression wasused to determine factors associated with a prescription of any antidepressant medication. Results . A total of 2444 patients with depression were included (mean age: 49.1 years (SD: 15.4); 77.3% female). 2645 prescriptions of were reported. Phytotherapeutic preparations from Hypericum perforatum were the most frequently prescribed antidepressants over all (44.6% of all antidepressants), follo wed by amitriptyline (16.1%). The likelihood of receiving an antidepressant medication did not depend on comorbidity after controlling for age, gender, ph ysician specialisation, and type of depression (adjusted OR (AOR) =1.01; CI: 0.81-1.26). Patients who had cancer were signicantly less likely to be prescribed an antidepressant medication than those who had no cancer (AOR =0.75; CI: 0.57-0.97). Conclusion . This study provides a comprehensive analysis of everyday practice for the treatment of depression in AM -physicians. Further analysis regarding the occurrence of critical combinations is of high interest to health services research. 1. Background Depression is one of the three leading causes of disease bur- den worldwide strongly correlated with increased morbiditya n dam a j o rr e a s o nf o rc o u n s e l l i n ga n dp r i m a r yp a t i e n tcare [ 1,2]. Depending on the study origin and setting, the prevalence of depression in the general population isestimated between 10% and 25% in females and 5-12% inmales with a one-year incidence rate of approximately 2%[3-5]. Thus, early detection and treatment of depression is a major task for health care policy makers. Due to increasingpatient numbers and the development of new antidepressivedrugs, family physicians today play an important role in the treatment of depressed patients [ 6,7]. Although approximately 40% of patients with depression still remainuntreated, those patients who decide to consult a therapistare more likely to see a family physician than a psychiatricspecialist for both diagnosis and treatment. This is quiteimportant as knowledge and accuracy of nonpsychiatricphysicians in treating depression have a great influence theoutcome of the illness. Although research has signicantly advanced in the last years, and depression is now generally more acknowledged as an important factor in primary care, patients, relatives,2 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine and physicians still have reservations and prejudices against pharmaco- or psychotherapy, which may aggravate a su - cient and individualized treatment of depression in primarycare and may account for insu cient treatment of depressive symptoms [ 7]. Studies have shown that only a small amount of primary care patients diagnosed with depression receive appropriate care, which may further lead to poor treatment outcome and increased mortality [ 4,7]. Accordingly, national guidelines about depression treat- ment in primary care are a key area of public policy. InGermany that is, the development of a German NationalDisease Management Guideline (DM-CPG) for depressionwas induced to increase transparency and improve patientcare [ 6,8,9]. With respect to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), guidelines from Germany, Canada, and Switzer-land have listed the phytopharmaceutical preparation ofHypericum perforatum [6,10,11] which is traditionally used quite frequently for mild and moderate depressions.Moreover its e ectiveness for unipolar depressive episodes was shown in systematic reviews and meta-analyses [ 12,13]. But also other drugs from phytotherapy or homoeopathymay have a potential in the treatment of depression [ 14,15]. However, the prescribing of antidepressants is influencedby physician\u2014as well as patient-related factors, and less isknown about prescribing habits of physicians in primary careparticularly of those being specialized in CAM. The present study, thus, aims to analyse prescribing patterns in a network of GPs and specialists with subspecial-isation in anthroposophic medicine (AM) for patients who e x p e r i e n c e dan e we p i s o d eo fd e p r e s s i o na n dt oi n v e s t i g a t e conformity and variations in antidepressant prescriptions.It was hypothesized that (a) Hypericum perforatum was the most frequently prescribed antidepressant and (b) thatpatients with co-morbidities were more likely prescribed anyantidepressant medication. 2. Methods Physicians for the EvaMed Network were recruited throughthe German National Association of Anthroposophic Physi-cians (GA \u00a8AD) in 2004 [ 16]. At that time, 118,085 primary care physicians were practising in Germany. Of those, 626(0.5%) primary care physicians were members of the GA \u00a8AD. For a physician to be eligible to participate in the study, his or her medical practice had to meet a number of technical requirements, including the presence of a specialcomputerized patient documentation system (DocExpert,DocConcept, TurboMed, Duria, PDE-T op, and Medistar), alocal area network (LAN) connection, and Microsoft Win-dows and Internet Explorer (i.e., as client software). From the626 physicians of the GA \u00a8AD, 362 (57.8%) met these criteria based on self-reported information and were contacted.Physicians were required to give their informed consent toparticipate in the EvaMed Network and to report all detectedserious ADRs (denition provided below \"data collectionand classication of ADRs\") to the EvaMed Network. A totalof 38 physicians from 12 of the 16 federal German statesnally agreed to participate in EvaMed, covering 6.1% of the overall primary care physicians of the GA \u00a8AD [ 17]. They all had practised for at least ve years in primary care in additionto completing training in anthroposophic medicine. For our study, 16 physicians specialized in paediatrics, dermatology, and gynaecology were excluded from the study which led to 22 physicians who participated in this study. The present study is based on secondary data provided by the physicians. As such, the recommendations for goodpractice in secondary data analysis (e.g., anonymization ofdata on prescriptions and diagnoses) were developed bythe German Working Group on the Collection and Use ofSecondary Data were applied in full [ 18]. Patients were included if they had at least one diagnosis of depression according to the 10th revision of the InternationalClassication of Diseases (ICD10: F32 or F33) during a 5-year study period (01 \u00b701\u00b72004-01\u00b701\u00b72009). Patients were excluded if patients were <18 years of age. Patients were also excluded if there was no new diagnosis of depressionduring the study period. \"New diagnosis\" of depression wasoperationally dened as having no diagnosis of depressionbefore and no prescription of any antidepressant medica-tion during the 6 months preceding the index diagnosis.Patients who had no o ce visit before the index depression diagnosis were also excluded because it was not able todistinguish, whether the index diagnosis represented eithera new diagnosis of depression or the entry of an establisheddiagnosis of depression for a new patient. Finally, we alsoexcluded patients with a recorded diagnosis of mania (F30),bipolar disorder (F31), or schizophrenia (F20) because it was thought that these patients would be treated di erently. During the study, physicians continued to follow their routine documentation procedures, recording diagnoses,and all prescriptions for each consecutive patient using theirexisting computerized patient documentation system. Thesedata were exported to the QuaDoSta postgreSQL databasehosted in each practice [ 19]. Physicians used a browser-based interface to match individual diagnoses with the correspond-ing drugs or remedies that had been prescribed. Prescribeddrugs were documented using the German National DrugCode. Diagnoses were coded according to the 10th revisionof the International Classication of Diseases (ICD-10). ICD10: J44). Multi-morbiditywas considered if a patient had at least two co-morbidities. Study investigators identied all drugs and remedies prescribed for depression. Each substance was classiedusing the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Index Germanversion (ATC). Antidepressant medication was clustered into and performed with SPSS 18.0 for Windows. Descriptive analysis was used to determine pre-scription rates. Means and standard deviations (SDs) werecalculated for continuous data. In cases where data were not normally distributed, medians and interquartile ranges (IQRs) were reported. Subgroup analyses of prescribing rateswere performed for patient age (18-39 years, 40-59 years,and 60 years and older), gender, and co-morbidities. Thetwo-tailed chi-square test was used to analyse di erences in prescription rates. A Pvalue of less than 0.05 was regarded as indicating a statistically signicant di erence. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% condence intervals (CIs) were calculated using multiple logistic regression with anyantidepressant being prescribed medication as the outcomevariable. For each outcome ORs were calculated for patientswho had and did not have each of the co-morbidities aswell as for who had and did not have any of the 6 co-morbidities. After calculating unadjusted OR, two modelsincluding potential confounders were determined. Model 1was controlled for patient age and gender, and model 2 wascontrolled for patient age, gender as well as for physicians'gender and specialisation and type of depression. Patient agewas introduced in the model as a continuous variable. 3. Results Of the 22 physicians, 17 were GPs (77%) and 5 were spe-cialists working as GPs (23%). The participating physiciansdid not di er signicantly from the overall population of physicians certied in anthroposophy in Germany ( n =362) in terms of age (mean =49.4; SD =6.3 years versus mean =47.5; (60.0% versus 62.2% men; P=0.917) and were only slightly younger and consisted of a similar percentage of women compared to alloce-based physicians in Germany (mean 52.0 years; 61.2% men) [ 20]. During the 5-year study period, a total of 2444 patients with depression were included. The inclusion process isshown in Figure 1 . 73.4% of all patients were treated by a GP ( n =1793), 17.9% by an internist ( n=437), and the remaining 8.8% of the patients were treated by a neurologist(n =214). 77.3% of the patients were female ( n=1889). The mean age of the patients was 49.1 years (SD =15.4). Altogether, 26.8% of the patients were 40-59 years years or older ( n=570). Depression was classied as depressive episode (88.3%) and recurrent depressive disorder (11.7%).There was no signicant di erence according to type of depression and age group ( P =0.789) or gender ( P=0.658). In total, 8.3% of all patients ( n=204) had two or more co-morbidities and were, therefore, classied as multi-morbid. The most frequent co-morbidities were cancer(14.4% of all patients), coronary heart disease (8.3%),and diabetes mellitus (7.1%).

Overall, 833 patients were prescribed an antidepressant medication, representing 33.9% of patients who experienceda new episode of depression. In total, 2645 prescriptionsof antidepressants for these patients were reported. Theywere nearly uniformly distributed over the four quarters (1stquarter: 630 (23.8%), 2nd quarter: 4th quarter: 754 (28.5%)). Table gives an overview of antidepres- sants. Phytotherapeutic preparations of Hypericum perfo- ratum were the frequently prescribed antidepressants over all (44.6% of all antidepressants). The most commonclass of conventional antidepressants prescribed was theNSMRI class, and amitriptyline was the most commonlyprescribed individual medication. Table 3 gives a detail overview of the included patients according to antidepressant medication. Phytotherapeuticpreparations from Hypericum perforatum were prescribed to 539 of 833 patients with antidepressant medication(64.7%), followed by NSMRI (28.2%), and SSRI (16.8%).The proportion of patients with antidepressant medica-tion was especially high among neurologists (76.2%). Theproportion of patients being prescribed any antidepressantmedication increased with patient age from 27.7% of patientsunder 40 years to 44.4% of patients of 60 years or older.Patients with multi-morbidity were more likely to receive anantidepressant than patients without co-morbidity (47.1%versus 32.9%; P =0.016 chi-square test).

As shown in Table 4 , the likelihood of being prescribed an antidepressant medication was not signicantly di erent for persons who had a co-morbid condition compared withthose who did not have a co-morbid medical conditionafter controlling for age and gender (model 1: adjustedOR =0.88; CI: 0.71-1.09) and after controlling for further potential confounder (model 2: adjusted OR =1.01; CI: 0.81-1.26). But there were signicant di erences according to the presence or absence of the individual co-morbidities.The adjusted OR for receiving any antidepressant medication was greater than 1 for the co-morbidity cerebrovasculardisease (model 1: adjusted OR =1.78; CI: 1.16-2.74; model 2: adjusted OR =1.76; CI: 1.12-2.76).

Finally model 2 also indicated OR <1 for the co-morbidities heart failure and COPD. Our data, however, suggest an increase in antidepressant medication over the time of the study period.

Discussion In this paper, we presented the results of a secondarydata analysis of electronic health record data from theEvaMed-Network, a German network of physicians with asubspecialisation in anthroposophic medicine [ 16,17,19] which aims at improving clinical practice by collectingprescription and ADR data. In the current study, 2444 patients with a rst diagnosis of depression tted the inclusion criteria. A proportionof 8.3% of them were multi-morbid with more than twodiagnoses. 33.9% of the patients received an antidepressantmedication. The proportion of patients with medications ismuch less compared to the ndings of, for example, 51.9%by Robinson et al., 76.1%, and accordingly 77.4% by Gilland colleagues in 2008 and 2010 respectively 2010 [ 21- 23]. This is even more of relevance as our patients received more complementary drug medication with phytothera-peutic preparations from Hypericum perforatum being the most prescribed drug over all. Within our study period, thenumber of psychiatric diseases and in particular depressivedisorders in Germany signicantly rose which is reflected in the data of prescription costs of antidepressants which according to health insurance data rose from 5 Mio. Euro in2000 up to 14.5 Mio. Euro in 2009 [ 24]. Published data also suggest a higher proportion of female patients receiving such medication [ 25,26]. Both of these are strongly supported by our ndings with three of four medicated patients being female and a doubling in the prescribed drugs per patientfrom 2004 to 2008. T o improve the situation of people with depression in Germany, a rst measure was the implementation of theGerman Disease Management Guideline (DMG-CPG) fordepression [ 6,8,9]. The increased of new antidepressive pharmacotherapies like SSRIs nowadays is6 Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine Table 4: Likelihood of being prescribed any antidepressant medication by co-morbidity ( n=2444).

One of their major concerns is the unjustied medicationof mild and potentially self limiting depressive episodes withexpensive medications with a high potential of adverse drugreactions. Our study also gives data on the prescription of NSMRI (28.2%) and SSRI (16.8%) which is considerably below theGerman standard. One reason might be the compensation ofsuch drug classes by the use of complementary drug therapieslike Hypericum perforatum. Several publication on prescriptions [ 24] state that citalo- pram, mirtazapin and amitriptylin are the most commonand popular remedies for depression. We also found thesethree remedies to be the most often prescribed conventional drugs. However, we can not tell why the ranking in our study is the other way round (Amitriptylin, Mirtazapinefollowed by Citalopram). This may be due to the comparablylonger time frame of our study or to the di erent sample of physicians. One explanation might also be that Amitriptylinis the \"oldest\" remedy and thus the most known. In the treatment of depression, medication is only one issue; guidelines additionally focus on nonpharmacologicaltreatments like psychotherapy, mind body techniques, orlight therapy. These are also relevant therapeutic optionswhich are very often underrepresented [ 23]. However, our data do not provide detailed information on such therapies. With regards to comorbidities, studies have shown the prevalence of depression to be higher for persons with heartdiseases, diabetes mellitus, stroke, COPD, and cancer [ 28]. This was also conrmed in the study of Gill et al. 2008 ,which found depression to be more likely among patientswith a signicant number of medical comorbidities [ 21]. In our study, 504 (20.6%) had at least one comorbidity, while204 patients (8.3%) had two or more comorbidities. This is nearly comparable to the proportions provided in the studyof Gill et al. from 2010, who found 20.7% with one and5.8% with two or more co-morbidities in their sample of1513 patients [ 22]. They also found that after controlling for age and gender, patients with multiple comorbidities wereless likely to be prescribed medication (adjusted odds ratio,0.58; 95% CI, 0.35-0.96). In our rst multivariate model,which equates the approach of Gill et al., we were also ableto show this e ect but were not able to reach signicance (adjusted odds ratio 0.88; 95% CI, 0.71-1.09). A moredetailed di erentiation between the co-morbidities was not performed to guarantee the statistical model performance. Although there is some comparability of our results with former studies, some discrepancies of our results with another German study of Jacobi et al. [ 29]h a v et ob e mentioned. Although the proportion for one comorbiditywith 20.8% is quite similar, they found 39.9% of depressivepatients with two or more comorbidities. This may beexplained by the fact that all patients with one depressiveepisode form the basis of their study which is not comparablewith our situation. 5. Limitations The present study has several important limitations whichshould be taken into account when interpreting the results.Firstly, additional data on the depression diagnoses arelacking. We do not know to what extent the diagnoseswere made, only clinically or with additional validatedquestionnaires, that is, as a functional evaluation with theWHO-5 or PHQ-D [ 30,31]. We therefore are also not able to give detailed information on the severity of the depression.Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine 7 Secondly, although physician prescribing data were sub- jected to an internal review, coding inaccuracies cannot beruled out entirely. Thirdly, our data do not provide more detailed infor- mation on the type and dosage of phytotherapeutic Hyper- icum perforatum preparations. For the same methodological boundaries, our data also do not allow a calculation of daily drug doses, which limits the comparability of our data withother studies. Fourthly, data on subsequent medication use in patients who switched physicians were unavailable. Fifthly, our data from the group of 22 participating physicians are not representative for physicians in generalpractice in Germany nor may be seen as such for the smallersubgroup of anthroposophical physicians. The same problemarises for the patients the data are based on. Althoughan earlier paper gives an estimate for the prevalence ofmood and a ective disorders (F00-F39) of about 10% in our patients between 40 and 70 years in 2005 which iscomparable to the numbers given, that is, in [ 7], it is less than the prevalence of 19.8% reported in [ 29]. Thus generalisations from this data are somehow limited. Finally, although there were no major di erences to the studies of Gill et al., the present study lacks a directcomparison group and the options to carry out detailedsubgroup analyses. Further research on this subject wouldbenet from including a comparison group of conventionalprimary care physicians. 6. Conclusion This study provides a comprehensive analysis of everydaypractice for treatment of depression in primary care in physi-cians with subspecialisation in anthroposophic medicine(AM). Although the administration of phytotherapeuticpreparations from Hypericum perforatum was signicantly higher, the prescribing frequency for conventional anti-depressive drugs is partly comparable to those found in otherstudies.
