The NSQF sets common principles and guidelines for a nationally recognized qualification system covering Schools, Vocational Education and Training Institutions, Technical Education Institutions, Colleges and Universities. It is envisaged that the NSQF will promote transparency of qualifications, cross -sectoral learning, student -centred learning and facilitate learner's mobility between different qualifications, thus encouraging lifelong learning. The National Curriculum Framework, 2005 recommends that children's life at school must be linked to their life outside the school. This principle makes a departure from the legacy of bookish learning which continues to shape our system and causes a gap between the school, home, community and the workplace. Pandit Sunderlal Sharma Central Institute of Vocational Education (PSSCIVE), a constituent of National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has developed modular curriculum and learning materials for the vocational subjects offered from Classes IX to XII (NSQF Levels 1 -4). This Student Handbook, which has been devel oped keeping in view the National Occupational Standards (NOS) set by the Healthcare Sector Skill Council (HSSC) for the Job Role of Patient Care Assistant/ General Duty Assistant is meant for students who have passed Class -VIII or equivalent examination. The National Occupational Standards are a set of competency standards used for recognizing and assessing occupational skills and knowledge needed to perform effectively in the workplace. The success of vocationalisation of education in schools depends on the steps that Principals and Teachers will take to encourage children to reflect their own learning and to pursue imaginative and on-the-job training activities. Participation of learners in skill development exercises and inculcation of values and creativity is possible if we involve children as participants in learning and not as receivers of information. Flexibility in the daily time -table would be a necessity to maintain the rigour in implementing the activities and the required number of teaching days will have to be increa sed for teaching vocational subjects. The Student Handbook has been developed and reviewed by a group of experts and their contributions are admirably acknowledged. The feedback and suggestions on the content by the teachers and other stakeholders will be of immense value to us in bringing abo ut necessary improvement in the Student Handbook.

Health Care Services 3 Session 1: Describe Healthcare Delivery Systems Relevant Knowledge A number of factors, like food, housing, clothing, hygiene, sanitation, lifestyle, pollution, climate, etc. can influence the health of an individual and population. Healthcare includes all the services provided to a person / population by various agencies related to health and related services. Healthcare services are the services designed to fulfill health based needs of people / community / population, through various resources available. These are delivered by healthcare system that includes the m anagement of health sector and its organizational structure. The healthcare services should be comprehensive and should be preventive, curative and rehabilitative. These services are provided through a network of various primary, private and community hea lth centers in India. Healthcare Systems The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health system as follows: \"A health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore or maintain health. This include s efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health -improving activities. A health system is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services. It includes, for example, a mother car ing for a sick child at home; private providers; behaviour change programmes; vector -control campaigns; health insurance organizations; occupational health and safety legislation. It includes inter - sectoral action by health staff, for example, encouraging the ministry of education to promote female education, a well known determinant of better health\". Provision of healthcare in India is a state subject. Healthcare in India is delivered by institutions owned by state government, local bodies and the central government. The center is mainly responsible for developing and monitoring national standards and regulations, linking the states with funding agencies, and sponsoring numerous schemes for effective implementation. The majority of healthcare services in India are provided by the private sector. The government and the private sector are helping in making healthcare accessible in all areas of India; both rural and urban. The healthcare system is composed of different parts designed to work together to make healthcare accessible to everyone. It consists of hospitals, dispensaries, laboratories and health department for the common objective of maintaining good health for the community. The various features of a healthcare system are as follows: It has a structure, a set of goals, input, transformation process, output and feedback; It is a continuous process and is composed of sub -systems; and It is an open system, where a number of external factors influence its functioning. 4 A number of healthcare delivery models have been developed for the delivery of healthcare services. The healthcare system/models in India can be categorized under the following sectors or programme: 1. Public Health Sector: It includes the following: a) Primary Healthcare Village level Accredited Social Health Activist Village level ANM (Auxiliary Nurse Midwife is a village -level female health worker in India who is known as the first contact person between the community and the health services). Sub centers. Primary Health Centre. b) Hospitals/ Health Centers Community Health Centers. Rural Hospital. District Hospital/ Health Centers . Specialty Hospitals. Teaching Hospitals. c) Health Insurance Schemes Universal Health Insurance programmes. Employee State Insurance Scheme. Central Government Health Scheme. Various schemes of contributory third party payment mechanism, e.g., Yashaswini Scheme, Arogya Bhadratha Scheme, etc. Employee Health Insurance Programme sponsored by employer and provided by General Insurance Companies. Health Insurance Programme (Mediclaim). d) Other Agencies Defense Services. Railways. Public Sector Companies. Private Companies providing healthcare facilities to their employees through their network. 2. Private Sector: It Includes the following: Private Hospitals, Polyclinics, Nursing Homes and Dispensaries. General Practitioners and Clinics. Health Care Services 5 3. Indian Systems of Medicine and Homeopathy a) Ayurveda : A system of medicine which utilizes herb s as medicine. b) Unani : Unani medicine has similarities to Ayurveda, as both are based on theory of the presence of the elements (fire, water, earth and air) in the human body. Tibb is the science through which we learn the various states of body. 'Tibb' means the knowledge of the states of the human body in health and decline of health, or in other words, medicine. 'Tibb -E-Unani', is an age old system of medicine, dating back 5000 years to Greece. c) Homeopathy : Homeopathy is a system of natural medicine in troduced and developed by a German physician, Samuel Hahnemann, at the end of the 18th century. It recognizes that the person's mind, body, spirit is affected when there is illness and therefore, seeks to treat that whole person. It treats diseases with remedies prescribed in minute doses. d) Naturopathy : Naturopathy deals with the healing power of nature since it believes that all healing powers are within your body. It works on the constructive principles of nature. e) Sidha : In Siddha system, thousands of raw drugs are used. These drugs are categorized into three groups, namely herbal products, metal, mineral products and animal products. Siddhars were saintly persons who achieved results in medicines. 4. Voluntary Health Sector and Non -Government Organizations The Voluntary Health Sector can be Broadly Classified as Follows: Campaign Groups: These groups are working on specific health issues, such as a rational drug policy and amniocentesis, among others. Government Voluntary Organization: These are voluntary organizations which play the role of implementing government programs like Family Planning and Integrated Child Development Services. Healthcare for Special Groups of People: This includes education, rehabilitation and care of the handicapped. Health Researchers and Activists: The efforts of these groups are usually directed towards writing occasional papers, organizing meetings on conceptual aspects of health care and critiquing government policy throu gh their journals. Health Work Sponsored by Rotary Clubs, Lions Clubs and Chambers of Commerce: They usually concentrate on eye camps - conducting cataract operations in the rural areas on a large scale with the help of various specialists, etc. Integrated Development Programs: In these programs, health is a part of integrated development activities. Consequently, their emphasis on health care may not be as systematic or as effective as that of the previous group. Specialized Community Health Programs: They include income generating schemes for the poorer communities so that they can meet their basic nutritional needs. 6 Input Provision of Healthcare Services Healthcare System Activity Search and learn Find out about various healthcare systems near your area and categorize them. 5.

Part C Performance Standards The performance standards may include, but not limited to: Performance Standards yes No Identify the functions of healthcare system. Identify various healthcare delivery models and their components. Session 2 : Identify Components and Activities of Hospital Relevant Knowledge The term Hospital is derived from the Latin Word Hospes meaning host, which is the root word for English words like hotel, hostel and hospitality. The place where a guest is received is called hospitium or hospitale. Thus, taking it further a hospital is a n institution for healthcare. Hospitals are an important and integral part of our healthcare delivery system. In general terms, hospitals provide acute care (treatment for illnesses which come on suddenly and are usually of short duration) and either general or specialized care (Children's, Cancer, Psychiatric, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) (AIDS). Meaning of Hospital According to World Health Organisation (WHO), a hospital is defined as an integral part of social and medical organization, the function of which is to provide for the population a complete healthcare, both preventive and curative. The outpatient services of the hospital reach out to the family and its home environment. The hospital is also a centre for the training of health workers and bio -social research. Hospital Set Up A hospital is an open system with various components that are integrated by common purpose of achieving a set of objectives. The various system and subsystems of a hospital can be schematically represented as follows: Health Care Services 9 Personnel, Finance and Management Services Non- clinical Support Clinical Services Out Patient Department Services Emergency and other Services Clinical & Nursing Services Other Services Support Services Figure: 2 The performance of all these services is dependent on the cooperation and coordination of various components within the system. The individual sub -systems have their independent goals for providing best patient care. It is can be inferred that hospitals are highly complex, social, economic and scientific organization whose funct ion is to provide comprehensive healthcare. Functions of Hospital The purpose of healthcare services is to effectively meet the total health needs of community. The hospitals play a major role in maintaining and restoring the health of the community. The main functions of the hospitals can be listed as follows: Restorati ve Functions Preventive Functions Training and Research in health and medicine The above functions can be further described as below: 1. Restorative Functions The various restorative functions of a hospital include: Diagnostic Activity: It includes the inpatient services involving medical, surgical and other specialties and specific diagnostic procedures. Curative Activities: It includes treatment of all ailments/diseases. Rehabilitative Activities: Those activities include physical, mental and social rehabilitation. Emergency Services: It includes emergency services required for dealing with accidents, natural disasters, epidemics, etc. Components of a Hospital 10 2. Preventive Functions The hospitals also carry out various preventive functions which include the following: Supervision of normal pregnancies and childbirth Supervision of normal growth and development of children Control of communicable diseases Prevention of prolonged illness Provision of health education services Occupational health services Preventive health check up 3. Training and Research Activities The training activities of the hospitals generally refers to the training of medical, paramedical and other support staff (Clinical/Non -clinical) required and working in the facility. The training is generally provided to: Medical undergraduates Nurses an d Midwives Specialists and post graduates Medical social workers Paramedical staff The research activities carried out by the hospitals are generally for the enhancement of medical technology and services in the following areas: Physical, psychological a nd social aspects of health and diseases Clinical medicine Hospital practices and administration.

Identify the various equipment used in a hospital. Session 3 : Describe Role and Functions of Clinic Relevant Knowledge A clinic (or an outpatient clinic or an ambulatory care clinic) is a healthcare facility that primarily provides maintenance or preventative care to the outpatients. The word clinic is derived from the Greek word klinein meaning to slope, lean or recline. Hence kline is a couch or bed, klinikos is sloping or reclining and Latin is clinicus. An early use of the word clinic was referred to the person 'one who receives baptism on a sick bed'. Clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded, and typically cover the primary healthcare needs of populations in local communities, in contrast to larger hospitals which offer specialised treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays. Role and the Functions of a Clinic The function of clinics will differ from place to place. For instance, a local general practice run by a single general practitioner will provide primary healthcare, and will usually be run as a for -profit business by the owner whereas a government specialist clinic may provide subsidised and specialised healthcare to the patients. They are adva ntageous to hospitals because they can provide immediate medical attention to patients who are suffering from illness. Some clinics function as a place for people with injuries or illnesses to come and be seen by nurse or other health worker. In these cli nics, the injury or illness may not be serious enough to warrant a visit to an emergency room, but the person can be moved to one if required. They sometimes have access to diagnostic equipment such as X - ray machines and other diagnostic facilities. Doctors at such clinics can often refer patients to specialists if required. Types of Clinics There are many different ty pes of clinics providing outpatient services. Such clinics may be public (government funded) or private medical practices. Health Care Services 13 A free clinic provides free or low -cost healthcare for it is generally provided by the State or Central government. A general out-patient clinic is a clinic offering a community general diagnoses or treatments without an overnight stay. A polyclinic is a place where a wide range of healthcare services including diagnostics can be obtained without need of an overnight stay. A specialist clinic is a clinic providing advanced diagnostic or treatment services for specific diseases or parts of the body. This type of clinic contrasts with general out- patient clinics, which deal with general health conditions and disease categories. A sexual health clinic deals with sexual health related problems, such as prevention and treatment of sexually transmitted infections. A fertility clinic aims to help women and couples to become pregnant. An ambulatory clinic offers outpatient guidance and counselling for various diseases and procedures that can be carried out in specialised hospitals or clinics. Exercise 1. Visit a nearby Clinic and Hospital and enlist the services provided by them and compare their services. Based on this, identify the advantages of a clinic over hospital and prepare a report of what you have observed vis-\u00e0-vis what you have been taught. Assessment 1. What is a clinic? 14 2.

Session 4 : Describe Rehabilitation Care Facilities Relevant Knowledge Rehabilitation / Convalescent care facilities help in restoring a person back to normal position and to get a useful place in society. As such, a rehabilitation center is a location in which rehabilitation can occur. People get displaced from society for various reasons. Some may experience an accident or illness that temporarily makes them unable to function normally; others may have an addiction that handicaps them. A rehabilitation center provides a support system to help restore people to their place in society. Functions of a Rehabilitation Center The function of a rehabilitation center is to provide the means and space to help in the recovery process. This process varies depending on the rehabilitation that is needed. Rehabilitation centers use a combination of therapy, small groups, individual sessions and highly structured living. The function of a rehabilitation center is to both increase the quality of life and to help the patient integrate back into the community. These Programs provides 24 -hour care to people who require specific medical and therapeutic services in a supportive environment. The program will help in rebuilding strength, endurance and functioning before returning home. Rehabilitation centre / Convalescent care provide the care needed when required, it includes: Medical and ther apeutic support; A specialized care plan to help regain strength and independence of the individual in need and Guidance to the family and caregivers needed to support the individual in need. Depending on a persons need, a specialized care team plan is le d by doctors and nurses with support from professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dietitians and social workers, develop a plan to help in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation centers are categorized into four types: 1. Occupational Centres: Occupational rehabilitation centers are often found in 16 clinics and hospitals. They use occupational therapy for assessment and treatment to develop, recover, or maintain the daily living and work skills of people with a physical, mental, or cognitive disorder. These rehabilitation centers focus on helping their clients regain skills needed to function. For example, an occupational therapist may work with a patient who has had a severe spinal cord injury and help regain the use of her arms or legs. An occupational rehabilitation center can help the patient in talking, writing, dressing herself and eating without assistance. The occupational therapist uses consistent rehabilitation exercises that help retrain the body. 2. Physical Rehabilitation Centres: They focus on the use of physical therapy for rehabilitation. Physical therapy or physiotherapy is a physical medicine and rehabilitation specialty that remediates impairments and promotes mobility, function, and quality of life through examination, dia gnosis, prognosis, and physical intervention (therapy using mechanical force and movements). Physical rehabilitation centers are similar to occupational rehabilitation centers, except they focus more on using physical exercises to help patients regain motor skills. Physical therapy (also called as physio -therapy) rehabilitation centers specialize in helping rehabilitate patients who have accident - related injuries or who have lost a limb, they also help rehabilitate those who have spi nal, muscular or bone problems due to degenerative diseases. 3. Addiction Rehabilitation Centres: The addiction rehabilitation centers give the intensive therapy and tools that a person needs to defeat alcohol and drug addiction so that he/she can get bac k on the right path and live a successful, happy and productive life. Rehabilitation centers also work with those who have addiction problems. Addictions rehabilitation centers provide both in - patient and out -patient programs. Rehabilitation centers are an important part of treating those addicted to drugs and alcohol. However, rehabilitation centers can also treat eating disorders and other addictions, such as gambling, etc. 4. Psychosocial Centres: Psychiatric rehabilitation, also known as psychosocial (involving both psychological and social aspects) rehabilitation is the process of restoration of community functioning and well -being of an individual diagnosed in mental health or mental or emotional disorder and who may be considered to have a psychiatric disability. Psychosocial rehabilitation centers focus less on physical rehabilitation and more on the rehabilitation of the mind. Psychosocial rehabilitation centers specialize in the treatment and rehabilitation of psychiatric disorders such as major depression, bi-polar disorder, and schizophrenia. Psychosocial rehabilitation was implemented as an alternative to long-term institutionalization. It works to help those suffering from psychiatric disorders stabilize themselves through therapy and medication. Patients also learn skills to cope with their disorder while living in society. Exercise 1. Visit an occupational rehabilitation center in a hospital and study the various practices adopted for providing rehabilitation to patients. 2. Based on your study devise a small plan for persons recovering from leg injury. Health Care Services 17 Assessment I. Short Answer Questions 1. What is the function of a rehabilitation clinic? 2.

Health Care Services 19 Session 5 : Describe Long Term Care Facilities Relevant Knowledge Long Term Care (LTC) is a variety of services which help meet both the medical and non-medical needs of people with a chronic illness or disability who cannot care for themselves for long period of time. Generally, the LTC provides the non -skilled care, such as assisting with normal daily tasks like dressing, bathing, and using the bathroom. Essentially, it involves providing a level of medical care that requires the expertise of skilled practitioners to address the often multiple chronic conditions associated with older popul ations. Long -term care can be provided at home, in assisted living facilities or in nursing homes. Long -term care may be needed by people of any age, although it is a more commonly needed for senior citizens. Definition Long Term Care facility provides rehabilitative, restorative, and/or ongoing skilled nursing care to patients or residents who are in need of assistance with the activities of daily living. Long -term care facilities include nursing homes, rehabilitation fa cilities, inpatient behavioural health facilities, and long -term chronic care hospitals. Need for Long Term Care Life expectancy is going up in most countries, implying that more and more people are living longer and entering an age when they may need ca re in their daily activities. In today's world 70 percent of all older people now live in low or middle -income countries. Countries and healthcare systems need to find innovative and sustainable ways to cope with changing scenario. This change is also being accompanied by changing social patterns, including nuclear families, different residential patterns and increased female labour participation in work force. These factors often contribute to an increased need for care. In many countries, the largest percentages of older persons needing LTC services still rely on informal home care, or services provided by unpaid caregivers who are usually non-professional family members, friends or other volunteers. Types of Long Term Care Long -term care can be provided formally or informally. Facilities that offer formal LTC services typically provide living accommodation for people who require on site delivery of around -the-clock supervised care, including professional health services, per sonal care and services such as meals and housekeeping. These facilities may be called as nursing home, personal care facility, residential continuing care facility, etc. Long - 20 term care provided formally in the home, also known as home healthcare, can also include a wide range of clinical services (e.g. nursing, drug therapy, physical therapy) and other activities such as physical construction accordi ng to the need of the patient. (e.g. renovating bathrooms and kitchens so that its easier for people to work). These services are usually ordered by a physician or other professional. Informal long -term home care is care and support provided by family members, friends and other unpaid volunteers. It is estimated that 90% of all home care is provided informally by a loved one. Exercise 1. For one day, volunteer to visit at an old age home. Write the detailed report about the routine followed and the assistance provided. 2. Suggest at least five ideas that enhance the quality of those living at the center you have visited. 1. In today's society, why do we need long term care? 2. Which services are provided at a Long Term Care facility? Discuss and Debate In India, most of the elderly receive non - formal care. What according to you is better option for caring for elderly , formal care in an assisted living home or care at home (non formal care) given by family members? Assessment Health Care Services 21 3.

Part C Performance Standards The performance standards may include, but not limited to: Performance Standards yes No Demonstrate the knowledge of Long Term Care facilities. 22 Session 6 : Hospice Care Relevant Knowledge Hospice care is a type and philosophy of care that focuses on the relieving and preventing the suffering of a terminally ill or seriously ill patient's pain and symptoms, and attending to their emotional needs. The focus of hospice care is on palliation of the patient's pain and symptoms. These symptoms may be physical, emotional, or psychosocial in nature. Hospice care focuses on bringing comfort, self-respect, and peace to people in the final time of life. Patients' symptoms and pain are controlled, goals of care are discussed and emotional needs are supported. Hospice believes that the end of life is not a medical experience; it is a human experience that benefits from expert medical and holistic support that hospice offers. Hospice care focuses on quality rather than length of life. It provides humane and compassionate care for people in the last phases of incurable disease so that they may live as fully and comfortably as possible. Hospice care treats the person rather than the disease, working to manage symptoms so that a person's last days may be spent with dignity and quality, surrounded by their loved ones. It's also family -centered it includes the patient and the family in making decisions. Hospice care is used when you can no longer be helped by curative treatment, and you are expected to live about 6 months or less if the illness runs its usual course. Hospice gives you supp ortive or palliative care, which is treatment to help relieve disease -related symptoms, but not cure the disease. Its main purpose is to improve your quality of life. Places where Hospice Care is Provided Hospice care is generally, designed to be availab le 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. It can be given at the patient's home, a hospital, nursing home, or private hospice facility. The doctor, guidance counselor helps in deciding which program is best for the patient and the family. Hospice can be provided at: 1. Home Hospice Care Most home health agencies and independently owned hospice programs, offer home hospice services. A nurse, doctor, and other professional staff monitor the home hospice program but the main caregiver is usually a family member or friend who is responsible for around -the-clock supervision of the patient. This person is with the patient most of the time and is trained by the nurse to provide much of the hands -on care. Health Care Services 23 Members of the hospice staff will visit regularly to check on the person, his/ her family, and caregivers to give needed guidance and services. Care begins when a patient is admitted to the hospice program, which generally means that a hospice team member visits your home to learn about you and your needs. Return visits are scheduled so that the patient's needs are re -evaluated regularly. To provide further support on call nurse and counselors are available throughout the day. 2. Hospital Based Hospices Hosp itals that treat seriously ill patients often have a hospice program. This allows patients and their families easy access to support services and healthcare professionals. Some hospitals have a special hospice unit, while others use a hospice team o f caregivers who visit patients with advanced disease on any nursing unit. In other hospitals, the staff on the patient's unit will act as the hospice team. 3. Long Term Care Facility Based Hospice Many nursing homes and other long -term care facilities have small hospice units. They might have a specially trained nursing staff to care for hospice patients, or they might make arrangements with home health agencies or independent community - based hospi ces to provide care. This can be a good option for patients who want hospice care but don't have primary caregivers to take care of them at home. Support Facilities Extended by Hospice Care Various types of services are provided by the hospice care team, depending upon the need of the patient and the family. The following are the main services extended by the hospice care: a) Pain and Symptom Control The goal of pain and symptom control is to help pati ent to be comfortable while allowing staying in control and enjoying life. This means that discomfort, pain, and side effects are managed to make sure that the patient is free of pain and symptoms as much possible and alert enough to enjoy the people aroun d you and make important decisions. b) Home Care and Inpatient Care Although hospice care can be provided at home, a patient may be admitted to a hospital, extended -care facility, or a hospice inpatient facility. The hospice can arrange for inpatient care and will stay involved in patient care and guiding the family through the process. The patient can go back to in-home care when he and his family are ready. c) Family Conferences Regularly scheduled family conferences, often led by the hospice nurse or social worker, keep family members informed about the condition of the patient and what 24 d) Bereavement Care Bereavement is the time of mourning after a loss. The hospice care team works with surviving loved ones to help them through the grieving process. A trained volunteer or professional counselor provides support to survivors through visits, phone calls, and/or other contact, as well as through support groups. T he hospice team can refer family members and care giving friends to other medical or professional care, if needed. Exercise 1.

Relate the abilities and strengths of self with the job role of Patient Care Assistant. Session 2 : Identify Various Activities of Patient's Daily Care Relevant Knowledge Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is a term used in healthcare to refer to daily self - care activities within an individual's place of residence, in outdoor environments, or both. Health professionals routinely refer to the ability or inability to perform ADLs as a measurement of the functional status of a person, particularly in regards to people with disabilities and the elderly. Younger children often require help from adults to perform ADLs, as they have not yet developed the skills necessary to perfor m them independently. ADLs are defined as \"the things we normally do such as feeding ourselves, bathing, dressing, grooming, work, homemaking, and leisure\". While basic categories of ADLs have been suggested, what specifically constitutes a particular ADL in a particular enviro nment for a particular person may vary. Health Care Services 33 Patient Care Assistance in the Hospital Patients need help with various activities because they may not remember or they may not be in that position to do them, they may have movement disorders a nd poor coordination and they may have lost interest in doing things, or may not understand why something needs to be done. They may not be able to understand instructions when someone tries to help them. Bathing and showering (washing the body). Bowel and bladder management (recognizing the need to relieve oneself). Dressing. Eating (including chewing and swallowing). Feeding (setting up food and bringing it to the mouth). Functional mobility (moving from one place to another while performing activities). Personal device care. Personal hygiene and grooming (including washing hair). Toilet hygiene (completing the act of relieving oneself). Daily Care Plan of Patients To a patient, every task could be a source of stress if it seems beyond their ability. On an average day, therefore, is a series of stressful tasks, and it is no wonder they get frustrated and tired. One very helpful way of reducing their stress is establishing a regular routine for the day doing the same things at the same time every day. This routine can be fine -tuned to ensure that the patient seems comfortable with it. Necessary tasks are all fitted into this routine so that the patient's day is regular and predictable, and the patient can get used to it. They need less effort to get through the day as they sort of know what to expect. They get a greater sense of comfort, and also feel more in control of their lives. The daily routine should only be disrupted if it is very necessary. In addition to a daily routine, the environment aro und the patient needs to be relaxed and friendly. Also, the patient should have access to whatever is needed to perform activities easily. There should be enough things to keep the patient oriented about where he/ she is, and what the time is. Also, depend ing on the patient's likes and dislikes, various other means of keeping the patient comfortable and relaxed should be adopted. This could include pictures of happy days, or incense, or music, if these are helpful to the patient. Often, caregivers do not spend enough time making the environment comfortable because they are already having enough work and problems handling care. But even a few appropriate adjustments to the home can drastically improve the patient's emotional state, and consequently, the patient's ability to understand and do things. All of us work better when we are relaxed and happy and surrounded by things we like. So do the patients. 34 When thinking of how to do something, we shouldn't think only of how to get the task accomplished, but also whether we can make it more pleasant for ourselves and the patient. That will change the activity from a chore to somethi ng we may enjoy. Helping Tips These are some of the tips that you can use for specific activities in healthcare: Bathing Patients often misjudge the temperature of the water, and may end up bathing with very hot or very cold water if not helped. A bathroom can be very unsafe for a patient if left alone, so stay with the patient. Patients may feel embarrassed or angry at the presence of a caregiver. Handing them the soap and then turning the face away may give them back their sense of privacy. A bath stool may be needed so that the patient sits down comfortably for the bath. Grab rails near the bath stool may also be needed. Be careful to dry folds in the body. Also dry areas like between the toes. If bathing is tiring and difficult, reduce frequenc y to what is indicated by the weather and the needs of personal hygiene. Or give partial baths. A daily full bath may not be needed. Use the bath time to check the patient for injuries and sores. Dental Care You may need to help the patient brush properly. Denture cleaning will probably have to be done by the caregiver. You may also, in later stages, have to assist the patient put in and remove the dentures; dentures should fit well, or the patient will get sores in the mouth. Grooming Patients may cut themselves while shaving with an ordinary razor, and therefore switch to twin blade or electric razors. Caregivers may need to take this activity after sometime. Combing hair is another activity the caregiver may need to take over. Nail cutting and filing require fine coordination, and will need to be taken over. Even if the patients are unable to use face creams and groom themselves, they like to look neat and presentable, and the caregiver needs to take over these tasks as the patient's inability makes them too difficult to be done independently. Dressing Too many clothes in the wardrobe may be confusing for the patient. Reduce Health Care Services 35 the choices by removing extra clothes. Retain only a few comfortable, loose clothes. Clothing may need to be simplified as coordination reduces. When laying out the clothes for the patient to wear, lay them out in the sequence in which they have to be worn. Make sure clothes are not too long, so that patients do not trip. Switch to clothes without zippers or elaborate buttoning. Instead of pajamas/ salwars with strings, use them with elastic or nightgown so that they can be just pulled on or taken off. Use shoes with velcro straps instead of shoes with laces. Toileting Incontinence occurs for many reasons, some of which are that the patient is not able to reach the bathroom in time, or forgets where the bathroom is. Use signage to point the way, have nightlights, have grab rails that the patient can use while reaching the bathroom, and have clothing that can be taken off easily. Timed visits to the bathroom often reduce accidents. Watch out for signs of constipation and dehydration (note colour of urine) and change diet and water intake accordingly. If the patient show s signs of pain while urine passing urine or during bowel movements, consult with the doctor. Be ready for accidents, and set up the house for quick cleaning after such accidents. Persons who have been used to different styles of toilets in their childhood may forget what a commode is for, and may need to be reminded. Grab rails or toilet seats with rails may make the experience of sitting on the toilet seat less frightening for the patient. Watch the patient to ensure proper wiping, and proper washing of hands. For visits outside, diapers may be a good option. Even patients, who could be tense about finding a suitable bathroom outside, may easily agree to using diapers for outside visits (such as to the doctor). Patients will need assistance in wearing and removing diapers. Eating Patients may forget to eat if family members have gone out and left the food on the table for them. Someone may need to ensure that the patients eat. Eating becomes messier over time, and patients who used to use a spoon may switch to eating with hand. They may have problems handling larger pieces, and food may need to be cut down in smaller sizes they can handle. 36 Patients may not mix food while eating. They may eat all the daal / sambar first, and the curds, and then try to eat the rice without anything mixed. They may finish off the vegetable or curry, and then be left with the roti and nothing to eat with it. They may even eat the pickles separately. This is because they find it a problem to handle multiple items. Caregivers may need to mix food and give it to them, or to make combined dishes like pulao, khichdi, bisi bele bath, and curd rice. Denture fitment becomes bad. The patient may lose more teeth, but not be mobile or alert enough to get a new denture. Chewin g becomes a problem over time, and food may need to be made softer, and finally, liquidized in a Mixer. Consult doctors about diet supplements like calcium and vitamins, and also find out whether the patient needs to take a serving of balanced diet. Drinking Water Sometimes, patients, in order to avoid repeated trips to the bathroom, reduce their water intake. They may also forget to drink water. Caregivers need to make sure that patients are drinking enough water. Doctors may also ask patients to include electrolyte drinks in the daily routine, if the patient is showing an electrolyte imbalance. Taking Medication In the beginning, patients may find it problematic to keep track of their medicines. Using small labeled boxes for the medicines can help. Soon, however, more care needs to be taken to ensure that patients continue taking their medicines as prescribed. Forgetting to take medication is a common problem. Patients cannot be depended on to take their medication as required. They may forget to do so. Even if reminded, they may not believe they need to take the medication (they may say things like, but I don't have high blood pressure). If caregivers insist, patients sometimes hide the medicine away under the mattress or pretend to swallow it and then spit it out. It is good to be alert on this, and if necessary, supervise the patient to ensure that the medicines are taken as prescribed. In later stages, as swallowing becomes difficult, doctors should be asked to switch prescriptions to medicines that can be crushed and given or can be substituted by syrups. Physical Exercise 1. Some amount of daily physical exercise is desirable. Walking is a good exercise. Over time, patients become unsteady, and grab rails may need to be installed at strategic places. 2. Range of motion exercises will keep the patient flexible and mobile longer. Health Care Services 37 Exercise 1 Prepare a daily care plan for patients. Short Answer Questions: 1. List any five daily activities of a patient. 2. List any two exercises that a diabetic patient can be asked to do.

Demonstrate the knowledge of the role of Patient Care Assistant in assisting patients in activities of daily living. Session 3: Describe Basic Requirements for Patient Comfort Relevant Knowledge Besides being aesthetically pleasing, the human environment must provide light, air, and thermal comfort. In addition, proper acoustics and hygiene are important. Comfort is best defined as the absence of discomfort. People feel uncomfortable when they are too hot or too cold, or when the air is odorous and stale. Positive comfort conditions are those that do not distract by causing unpleasant sensations of temperature, drafts, humidity, or other aspects of the environment. Ideally, in a properly conditioned space, people should not be aware of equipment noise, heat, or air motion. The feeling of comfort or discomfort is based on a network of sense organs: the eyes, ears, nose, tac tile sensors, heat sensors, and brain. Thermal comfort is that state of mind that is satisfied with the thermal environment; it is thus the condition of minimal stimulation of the skin's heat sensors and of the heat - sensing portion of the brain. The envi ronmental conditions conducive to thermal comfort are not absolute, but rather vary with the individual's metabolism, the nature of the activity engaged in, and the body's ability to adjust to a wider or narrower range of ambient. For comfort and efficienc y, the human body requires a fairly narrow range of environmental conditions compared with the full scope of those found in nature. The factors that affect humans pleasantly or adversely include: 1. Temperature of the surrounding air 2. Radiant temperatures of the surrounding surfaces 3. Humidity of the air 4. Air motion 5. Odours 6. Dust 7. Aesthetics 8. Acoustics 9. Lighting 10. Room hygiene 11. Sound 12. Bed comfort Health Care Services 39 13. Patient's hygiene Exercise 1. List various elements that can help in providing comfort to patients. 2. Prepare patient check list and compare with standard measurements. 3. Demonstrate care needed by the patient.

What are the various elements that need to be considered for providing comfort to the patient? Part C Performance Standards The performance standards may include, but not limited to: Performance Standards yes No List various factors that affect patient's comfort and daily requirements. Session 4: Describe Various Aspects of Patient's Safety Relevant Knowledge The environment of a patient is vital to assist in the recovery process. As such, the environment must be maintained so that it contributes to and not be a detriment to healing. The patient's environment consists of the setting around him, equipment, furniture, as well as people. The patient's environment should have the following characteristics: 1. The environment should be conducive to rest. 2. The environment should be well lighted to ensure safety. 3. The environment should be free from noise and extraneous activity. 4. The environment should be well ventilated. 5. The environment should be predictable. Environment Conducive to Taking Proper Rest When a person is sick, he/she requires plenty of rest among other things as part of his/her therapy. It should allow the patient to regain his/her resources so that he restores his/her health. Many factors should be considered to make this possible, such as scheduling procedures promptly. In addition, assisting the patient in their activities of daily living should be as close to the personal routines the patient has at home. For example, some patients prefer to have their baths in the morning, while others prefer them in the evening. Schedule for visitors should be adhered to so that the patient can focus on physical rest. Well-lighted Rooms Since many elderly individuals are usually hospitalized, their needs must be kept in mind. Accidents may be prevented when corridors and rooms have good lighting. Good lighting includes the avoidance of glares which can distract the patient's vision. Health Care Services 41 Free from noise and Extraneous activity Noise pollutes. If a hospital environment is noisy, it detracts from the healing that rest provides. Personnel should control their voices when talking and avoid the use of telephones and other personal electronic equipment in patient care areas. Trolleys, carts, stretchers, and wheelchairs should not be noisy so as to distract the patient. Well Ventilated Rooms Maintaining good ventilation can be achieved in air -conditioned as well as non -air- conditioned rooms. The Patient care Assistant should ensure that good ventilation is achieved by not allowing crowds of people to visit at the same time, as well as to maintain a good air circulation by opening or closing windows or doors as needed. Making Environment Familiar As part of the admission procedure, patients and their families are oriented to the room. Since patients are in unfamiliar surroundings, consistenc y in the placement of personal effects, equipment and furniture should be maintained. They should know where the urinal or bedpan is or where they can obtain water and their personal effects. The patient care assistant should always return these equipment or furniture to their original placements so as not to confuse the patient. In addition, routines should be followed closely as much as possible, such as the schedule for meals, as well as visitation. Patient Environment and Its Components 1. Typical Equipment / Accessories in the Patient's Room include the following: Bedside table Overhead table Sink Bed Mattress Intravenous (IV) pole Soap dispenser Glove container Sharps and needle trash Bin for different biomedical waste 2. Supplies in the Patient's room include the following: Bed sheets Soap Towels 42 Nursery Unit / Ward A nursery unit / ward typically comprise the following: Nursing station Medication room Examining room Treatment room Procedure room Clean utility room Dirty utility room Kitchen Traffic Patterns in Patient Rooms and Hallways Another aspect of creating a safe environment in the hospital is adhering to traffic patterns. It includes the following: 1. Elevators used for transporting carts, drugs and equipment should not be accessible to non -hospital personnel; 2. Delivery carts should never be left unattended in hallways. They should always be parked away from access pathways, as well as away from patient rooms; 3. Walk following the rules of street traffic. Keep left; 4. Use the stairways instead of the elevator when going up one floor or when going down two floors. 5. Ensure that hallway hazards, such as a wet floor, are marked with appropriate warning signs or notices. Proper Functioning of Equipment and Patient Room acces sories Equipment and accessories in patient rooms are designed to either contribute to the therapeutic regimen of a patient or to assist the patient in maintaining activities of daily living. As such, equipment and accessories should be functional at all times. It should be part of the ward activity for personnel to check these at regular intervals as part of a preventive maintenance program. Rooms should be checked before a patient is admitted to the make sure that equipment are in working order. Defecti ve equipment should be tagged and sent to the appropriate department for repair. In addition, all equipment should have a regular schedule of being calibrated, tested, and updated as recommended by the manufacturer. Remember that prevention is better than repair. Do not wait for an equipment to fail while it is used on a patient. Health Care Services 43 Exercise 1. Visit a private and a government - run hospital and observe their set - up of patient rooms. What are the similarities / differences? 2. Debate: Visitors should be allowed to visit patient anytime. 3.

Relevant Knowledge Patient Care Assistant (PCA) or General Duty Assistant (GDA) works in a range of healthcare settings and makes a valuable contribution in all areas of healthcare. They work under the supervision of nurse in the hospital. As per to the institutional guideline, the PCA has to have a good code of ethical conduct. Session 5 : Describe Qualities of a Good Patient Care Assistant Health Care Services 45 Medical Ethics Some of the important medical ethics they should follow which are listed below as per Indian Medical standards: 1. Informed Consent: Tell the truth and make sure that the patient understands it properly when they are obtaining the patient's consent to a procedure or treatment. 2. Confidentiality: The PCA should consider the details about his patients as purely personal between him and the patient. Except for prof essional reasons the details should not be discussed with others or in public. 3. Communication: Clear communication between the PCA and the patient is very important for successful treatment. Any doubt that the patient has should be dealt with care and clear ed at once in simple language which he/she understands. 4. Control: It is the ability to purposefully direct or change. 5. Cultural Concerns: To be sensitive to the cultural practices of the patient/client in any given circumstance. 6. Communication with Family Members of the Patient: The PCA should understand the anxiety of the relatives of the patients and make them aware of the medical condition of the patient. 7. Business Related Issues: Healthcare providers should not entertain unethical practices in the hospital. 8. Telling the Truth about Illness, about Medication, and Side Effects of Medicines: Telling the truth implies respect for autonomy - if a patient is lied to, they cannot make a reasoned and informed choice, because they do not have the information they need to do so. 9. Follow the Guidelines of the Hospital: The PCA should strictly follow the guidel ines for hygiene, patient care, etc. This helps prevent hospital induced infections. 10. Accountability: As a professional, the PCA is personally accountable for actions and omissions in his/her practice and must always be able to justify his/ her decisions.

Session 6: Biomedical Waste and its Management Relevant Knowledge Hospitals, clinics, and medical teaching facilities dispose off waste products that have a potential risk to people, animals, and the environment. \"Any waste which is generated during the diagnosis, treatment, or immunization of human beings or animals or in research activities pertaining thereto or in the production or testing of biological\" are considered biomedical waste according to the Biomedical Waste Management a nd Handling Rules 1998 of India. When these waste products are not disposed of properly, it may result in transmission of diseases to humans. Patient Care Assistants, like other Health Care Workers must know what biomedical waste is and how to dispose them off in the appropriate containers. By having waste classified, it becomes easier to process the waste so that it is decontaminated following existing guidelines. In addition, proper classification and disposal of biological waste protects healthcare worke rs and others in the community from accidental exposure to infectious or hazardous materials. 50 Paper waste Kitchen wasteUninfected Plastic wasteGloves cover Segregation of Biomedical Waste at Source As soon as a waste product is identified, it must be disposed of properly according to the classification of that waste. For example, if you used a glove contaminated with a body fluid, such as blood, it must be disposed in the right container immediately. By disposing and segregating the waste at its source, it will limit the potential exposure to individuals involved in waste management. Colour Coding and Type of Containers for Disposal of Bio -Medical Waste BLACK BAG: Black bags are used for disposing off paper waste, uninfected plastic waste, gloves, wrappers, masks, empty ointment tubes and caps. yELLOW BAGS: yellow bags are used for disposing off the following items: Items contaminated with blood. Cotton containing body fluids. Blood stained tissues. Dressings, soiled plaster cast. Discarded medicines. Cytotoxic drugs. Electrocardiogram (ECG) electrodes. Caps Empty ointment tubes Figure : 1 Mask Wrappe rs Gloves cover Uninfected Plastic waste Kitchen waste Paper waste Figure : 2 Health Care Services 51 BLUE BAGS: Blue bags are used for Disposing off the following items: All unbroken glasses and vials. Empty uninfected bottles (Betadine, Micro -shield bottles). RED BAGS: Red bags are used for collecting and disposing the following: Infected plastic waste Catheters Gloves Syringes, IV sets Blood bags Uro bags NG tube Vacutainers ET tubes Ventilator Circu its Oxygen mask Three -way extension tubes Blood glucose strips Label for Transport of Bio -Medical Waste Containers / Bags After segregation of biomedical waste, they will need to be transported according to established rules to the appropriate disposal facility. Some of these wastes will be burned (incinerated), microwaved, autoclaved, buried, or as specified by policy or legislation. These policies will also specify the method in which the waste will be transported. Manual handling of the biomedical waste is minimized by the use of available technology. Safeguards are also in place to minimize scavengers from accessing the biomedical waste. For transport of the waste, rules specify that the label contain the biomedical waste, a signature from the doctor or nurse, and the destination of the waste. The following illustrations indicate the universal symbol for biohazardous wastes. Figure: 3 52 Exercise 1.

Activity: Hand -on practice & session on . grooming and other practices related to personal care and hygiene. 56 Session 1: Demonstrate Good Hygiene Practice Relevant Knowledge Hygiene is a set of practices performed for the preservation of health. While in modern medical sciences there is a set of standards of hygiene recommended for different situations. What is considered hygienic or not may vary between different cultures and gender groups. Some regular hygienic practices may be considered as good habits by a society, while the neglect of hygiene can be considered disgusting, disrespectful or even threatening. Sanitation involves the hygienic disposal and treatment by the civic authority of potentially unhealthy human waste, such as sewerage and drainage. Personal Hygiene Personal hygiene is the first step to good grooming and good health. Elementary cleanliness is common knowledge. Neglect causes problems that you may not even be aware of. Many people with bad breath are blissfully unaware of it. Some problems may not be your fault at all, but improving standards of hygiene will control these conditions. Dandruff is a case in point. More often than you know, good looks are the result of careful and continuous grooming. Grooming Routines Every external part of the body demands a basic amount of attention on a regular basis. Here are some grooming routines and some complaints associated with neglect. Hair Skin Teeth Hands Nails Feet Menstrual Hygiene Dressing and Undressing Bathing Shaving Hair Hair is your crowning glory. If you are blessed with hair, it is easy enough to maintain it. Keep it at a length and style at which you can maintain it. Wash your hair at least once a week using soap or mild shampoo. Avoid shampoos Health Care Services 57 with borax or alkalis. Rinse well. This is more important than working up a head load of lather. Dry your hair after a wash. Brush your hair three to four times a day with a soft bristled brush or a wide toothed comb. Wash your brush and comb every time you wash your hair. Oil the scalp, once a week, preferably an hour before hair wash. There are no completely safe or permanent hair dyes as of now. Apart from causing scalp allergies, dyes can also cause allergic colds and t hroat conditions. Perform a sensitivity test every time you use hair colour. Skin Baths were apart from daily ablutions, mandatory as part of observing pollution for various reasons and occasions. But ritual bathing, or a dip, is quite different from the daily bath personal hygiene demands. Soap and water are essential for keeping the skin clean. A good bath once or twice a day is recommended, especially in tropical countries like India. Those who are involved in active sports or workout to a sweat would do well to take a bath after the activity. A mild soap will do the job adequately. Germicidal or antiseptic soaps are not essential for the daily bath. You can use a bath sponge for scrubbing. Back brushes and heel scrubbers are available. But do not use abrasive material. Wash off well after soaping. Drying with a clean towel is important. Avoid sharing soaps and towels. Around middle age, the skin tends to go dry a bit. A moisturising oil or cream can be used. It is better to use this at night, because if you go out in the sun or commute on dusty roads when the skin is wet, dust sticks to it and oils may also give you a tan. Teeth Have you heard of the sixty -second battery operated wonder brush? It has been analysed that it takes only that long to give your teeth a good brush. You have to ho ld the brush to your teeth and say cheese (and then perhaps S -A-U-C-E for the brush to get a good scrub inside!). Well, whether it is a neem twig or battery brush, you cannot give brushing a miss. Brush teeth twice a day and rinse well after every meal. Brushing before going to bed is important (especially recommended for people with a sweet tooth). For normal teeth this is adequate. While brushing, pay attention to the fact that you are getting rid of the food particles stuck in between the teeth and in the crevices of the flatter teeth at the back, the molars and premolars. Brush down on the upper teeth and brush up on the lower teeth. Use a circular motion. Pay attention to the tongue and the inner surface of teeth as well. The brush should have resili ent bristles. It should be rinsed well and left to dry after use. There are no perfect toothpastes or powders. Use one without harsh abrasives or strong antiseptics. 58 Hands The world around us swarms with micro -organisms. Some bacteria are found on our bodies. In countries where food is eaten and prepared with bare hands extra attention has to be paid to the cleanliness of hands. Besides, a permanent layer of dust or grime reduces the sensitivity of the hands. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after every meal and after visiting the toilet. Soaping and rinsing should cover the areas between fingers, nails and back of the hand. Hands should be dried with a clean towel after wash. The towel at the wash stand has to be washed and changed everyday. While cooking, especially when packing lunches, you can prevent food from spoilage and minimise contamination by keeping your hands clean. While handling food avoid scratching, or touching the ears, nose, mouth or other body orifices. If you need to use a handkerchief or tissue, wash your hands after that. Keep your nails short. Nail Polish users should see that it does not chip off into the food. Nails For horny, largely vestigial growths at the tips of your fingers, they are pretty important, especially or reasons of hygiene and for cosmetic industry. It takes five months for nails to replace themselves. Grow nails only if you can keep them clean. Short nails make less trouble. Clip nails short, along their shape. Don't cut them so c lose that it pinches the skin. A healthy body ensures healthy nails. Brittle or discoloured nails show up deficiencies or disease conditions. Do not keep your nails painted continuously. It causes the keratin, of which nails are made, to split. Pamper your hands and nails once every three weeks with a manicure. This requires soaking your hands in warm water for ten minutes, massaging of hands, thorough cleaning and shaping of nails. Choose your manicure kit with care. In some kits, the instruments are crudely made and they will do more harm than good. Feet Give your feet a good scrub with a sponge, pumice stone or foot scrubber that is not made of very abrasive material when having a bath. Dry after bath between toes. Keep toenails clipped. In many Indian households it is mandatory to wash feet as you enter the house. This is fine, but make sure that your skin does not become dry due to washing too often. Those who use shoes constantly need to slip them off now and then. This airs the socks a bit and makes them less smelly. Wear cotton socks. Wear a clean pair every day. Powder your feet before wearing socks. It will help in keeping away sweat and fungal infection. Many people have sweaty feet, and socks and shoes can get quite smelly. If possible do not wear the same pair of shoes every day. Keep at least one more pair and use it alternatively. Go for a pedicure once in three weeks. Give importance to wearing comfort in the choice of footwear. For those who go barefoot indoors, door ma ts must be cleaned or changed frequently. Extra foot care is required for diabetics. Health Care Services 59 Menstrual Hygiene No woman feels completely comfortable when she has her menstrual period. If it is not pre menstrual tension or stomach cramps it is the problem of dealing with the menstrual flow. Technology offers sanitary pads, tampons or menstrual cups or caps to deal with the flow. The user has to decide what suits her best. Absorbent pads may be noticeable in form fitting clothes. They cause some soreness on the inner thighs. Some women prefer tampon to external pads. A plug of absorbent cotton or gauze is inserted inside. But these should not be left unchanged beyond six hours. Some brands state that tampons left unchanged for more than 12 -18 hours increases the possibility of toxic shock. It is not clear what causes toxic shock. But there seems to be a link between tampons and Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Approximately 1% of all menstruating women carry the bacteria in question (Staphylococcus aureus) in their vagina. Absorbent tampons provide the medium for them to grow and spread infection. TSS cases were first reported in 1978. It is marked by high fever, severe vomiting and diarrhoea. The cases can be mild to fatal. The menstrual cup (or cap), is inserted within and collects the flow and can be emptied, cleaned and re-used. Whatever the preference, washing is important. There need be no taboo about bath on these days. Some people have the problem of odour during menstruation. Cleanliness and change of pad/tampon as often as is necessary reduces this problem. It is not advisable to use perfumed pads or tampons. In fact, using powder in the genital area is not recommended. Health and Hygiene Education Health education plays an important role in the community hygiene. To prevent illness and have positive health attitude, correct and complete knowledge of health is necessary. Health is cleanliness and cleanliness is one of the m ain defenses against diseases, whether contagious or self -generated. In this lesson we will discuss the actual meaning of health and hygiene, so that the aim of good health can be achieved through sanitary habits and healthy way of living. Hygiene promotion follows the same approach as health promotion, in that it is concerned not only with the transmission of information, but with understanding and promoting the capacities of people to improve their own health, chiefly through their ability to: Make best use of prevailing environmental health conditions and existing services and facilities; Act to improve environmental health conditions and Make behavioural changes to reduce certain environmental risks at the household level. Hygiene promot ion is concerned with achieving improvements in health through the joint efforts of individuals, families and communities on one hand, and external 60 agencies, health authorities, etc. on the other. It is a process in which environmental health conditions and hygiene related behaviour are assessed, and changes in conditions, services and behaviour are achieved. A key feature of hygiene promotion is that it depends for its success on the careful analysis of people's constraints, opportunities and strengths in any situation, to seek solutions to hygiene problems that are realistic and appropriate to people's desires and ways of living. Recent work on hygie ne promotion in development and emergency situations has underlined the advantages of hygiene promotion over the more traditional and narrower approach of hygiene education and health education. Hygiene promotion and hygiene education are used broadly to i nclude aspects of health, such as avoiding exposure to all types of hazards, as well as aspects more narrowly defined as relating to hygiene, such as the control of communicable diseases in an emergency. Importance of Personal Hygiene Maintaining personal hygiene is necessary for many reasons; these can be personal, social, for health reasons, psychological or simply as a way of life. Essentially keeping a good standard of hygiene helps to prevent the development and spread of infections, illnesses and bad odours. Personal Reasons Many people, women in particular, are very conscious of their hygiene needs and practices. This can be a result of being taught of the importance from an early age, from being picked -on at school for head lice or similar. Self-esteem, confidence and motivation can all be altered by our body image, often reflected on our ability to care for ourselves and keep good hygiene practices. A bright white smile with clean and healthy teeth can endear people t o us, whereas brown, unhealthy teeth can cause embarrassment and can alter our sense of well - being. Healthy hair, skin and nails are signs of a good well-balanced diet and can give us confidence in everyday life. Social Reasons Most people hate to be talked about, especially in a negative manner. By ensuring that our body is clean and well presented, we are more assured of projecting a positive body image that reflects our personalities. Children should be taught the importance of hygiene and how to achieve good hygiene very early to keep themselves and others healthy and to reduce the risk of being bullied at school. Health Reasons If a person is due to go into hospital, sometimes that person becomes very aware of his/her hygie ne. The thought of being vulnerable and exposed to strangers can cause the person to become very strict on their hygiene needs. If you have cut yourself, the wound should be cleaned and dressed suitably; this can help reduced the risk of infection and pa in. Conditions such as head lice, athlete's foot, etc. should be treated Health Care Services 61 immediately to prevent further infections and spread to others. Hand washing cannot be emphasized enough as this simple action can prevent a plethora of illnesses and disorders developing. Many people 'forget' to wash their hands after using the toilet or before handling foods; this deed can cause a great deal of illness and even death. Psychological Issues By being well presented, clean and tidy, people can feel more confident, especially in social situations. Many job interviews and such like are highly dependent of hygiene as many decisions are made by first impressions within the first few minutes of meeting; these decisions are often made in the sub -conscious. Our chances of succeeding either in work or social settings, or even with the opposite sex ca n be altered by our maintenance of hygiene. Maintaining hygiene practices helps to reduce the risks of ill health, but equally important affects how we and others perceive ourselves and can influence our levels of confidence and self -esteem which can affe ct many aspects of our lives.

Begin with a visit to your physician Tell your doctor if you are about to start a new exercise routine, especially if you've been inactive. He or she will recommend that you have a physical examination to preempt unwanted surprises with your health and ensure you can exercise safely. 64 2. Make good health as your goal Remember that your overall health is what matters most. Vow to not make excuses, commit yourself to a lifestyle change, and start new habits that will improve your health and outlook. 3. Start slowly and gradually to build your fitness A gradual approach to fitness will help ensure that you maintain your routine and prevent injur ies. 4. Eat for balanced energy Be sure that your overall diet is well balanced to give you the energy you need throughout the day and during your workout. Since eating just before you exercise can lead to cramping, consume an easily digestible food such as a banana at least an hour before you work out. 5. Keep a written log of your exercise schedule and set goals In addition to being a good reminder of what you have done at each workout, a written log will give you a chance to work toward a goal and see what you have accomplished as you progress through the weeks and months. 6. Exercise each day Establishing a routine often makes it easier to stick with an exercise program. 7. Exercise with a friend whenever possible Walking or running with a friend will give you the chance to visit as well as ward off boredom. Many exercisers suggest their workout flies by when they have a partner. 8. Change your route if you walk or run Check out new neighbourhood, tracks and parks. Changing the scenery can add interest to your routine and help prevent boredom. 9. Warm up, work out and cool down with each exercise session Starting slowly and g radually increasing the intensity of your workout is a good way to prevent injuries. 10. Include music in your routine Music is a good distraction from the monotony of exercise. Use faster tunes to boost the intensity of your work out and calm music to help yo u cool down. 11. Consider safety Choose routes with little traffic. Walk or jog on sidewalks whenever possible. If you exercise outside, schedule your workout during the day. When exercising at dawn, dusk, or at night, wear bright colours and reflectors so that you can be easily spotted. 12. Keep changing your exercise Try Yoga for stretching and balance. Brisk walking, running, jogging, and spinning Health Care Services 65 is useful for enhancing for endurance; and weight training to build strength.

Make a point of adding extra activities in your day such as taking the stairs instead of the elevator and walking instead of driving to lunch. 13. Dress appropriately for your activity Wear fast -drying fabrics, such as polyester blends that wick away moisture and help keep you warm. Be sure your shoes fit well and are made for the activity you have chosen. 14. Focus on a pleasant memory, thought, fantasy, or activity while you work out Some exercisers find inspiration in positive self talk as they work out. 15. Have a positive outlook about weather Exercising outside in light rain, on cloudy days, and even cold, windy days can energise you and make you feel more in touch with the weather elements. 16. Get plenty of sleep Sleep is essential for getting a good workout. If you did not have enough sleep, either take a rest day or modify your workout so that it is less vigorous. 17. Drink at least 2 litres of water per day Remember that your body is 70 percent water. If you have not had enough to drink, your workout is likely to fall short of your expectations. 18.

Health Care Services 67 Session 3 : Perform Hand Washing Relevant Knowledge Hand washing for hand hygiene is the act of cleaning one's hands with or without the use of water or another liquid, or with the use of soap, for the purpose of removing soil, dirt, and/or microorganisms. Medical hand hygiene pertains to the hygiene practices related to the administration of medicine and medical care that prevents or minimizes disease and the spreading of disease. Hand washing with soap is the single most effective and inexpensive way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI). The main medical purpose of washing hands is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (including bacteria or viruses) and chemicals which can cause personal harm or disease. This is especially important for p eople who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public. People can become infected with respiratory illnesses such as influenza or the common cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has stated: \"It is well documented that one of the most important measures for preventing the spread of pathogens is effective hand washing.\" As a general rule, hand washing protects people poorly or not at all from airborne diseases, such as measles, chickenpox, influenza, and tuberculosis. It protects best against diseases transmitted through fecal -oral routes (such as many forms of stomach flu) and direct physical contact (such as impetigo). In addition to hand washing with soap and water, the use of alcohol gels is another form of killing some kinds of pathogens and healthful bacteria, but their effectiveness is disputed, and may lead to antibiotic -resistant bacterial strains. Washing hands properly after using the toilet, changing nappies, handling animals and before and after handling food helps prevent the spread of various forms of gastroent eritis, some of which can cause serious health problems. Use soap and warm running water and wash hands for at least 10 seconds. Liquid soap is best. Why is Hand Hygiene Important? The hands normally have a \"resident\" population of micro -organisms. Other micro - organisms (germs) are picked up during everyday activities, and these are termed \"transient\" organisms. We all carry millions of germs on our hands, most are harmless, but some cause colds, flu, skin infections or diarrhea. When we forget to wash our hands, we can spread these germs to other people. We can also infect ourselves by touching our eyes, mouths or open cuts. Hand washing 68 should remove these transient organisms before they are transferred to surfaces, another patient or to a susceptible area on the same patient. Why is Hand Hygiene Important in Health Care? People receiving healthcare may be more vulnerable to infection from germs carried on their hands or other people's. Germs that naturally live on the skin and normally cause few problems may be more serious when brought into a healthcare environment. These germs are often passed from one person to another by physical contact so it's important that patients, visitors, health care workers, nursing staff and doctors cut the risk of spreading infections by regularly cleaning their hands. Advice to Healthcare S taff and Patients All health care staff should use hand wash or alcohol gel: Before and after direct patient contact; After helping a patient to use the toilet, bathroom or commode; After any contaminating procedure; Before putting on and after taking off gloves. Please wash your hands whenever you can see your hands are dirty, before and after eating food and after using the toilet. You may wash them at any sink with liquid soap and warm water or use one of the hand gels available. Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria. Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37o C). However, warm, soapy water is more effective than cold, soapy water at removing the natural oils on your hands which hold soils and bacteria. Removal of microorganisms from skin is enhanced by the addition of soaps or detergents to water. The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce barriers to solution, and increase solubility. Water is an inefficient skin cleanser because fats and proteins, which are components of organic soil, are not readily dissolved in water. Cleansing is, however, aided by a reasonable flow of water. A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a non -water -based hand hygiene agent. Hand sanitizers are most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses. Alcohol -based hand sanitizers are almost entirely ineffective against norovirus or Norwalk type viruses, the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis. Frequent use of alcohol -based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless skin moisturizers are added to the formula. If you have wound dressi ngs, stitches, catheters or an intravenous line, try not to touch them any more than absolutely necessary. You could spread germs to other parts of the body. Medical hand -washing should be done for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to lather and rub each part of the hands. Let us now practice the steps used for hand washing. Health Care Services 69 Steps for Hand Washing Figure: 1 70 Exercise 1. Discuss the following topics in groups: (a) How hand washing helps in preventing spread of germs? (b) What are the precautions to be followed while using various types of soaps/ hand sanitizers? 2.

Health Care Services 71 SESSION 4: DEMONSTRATE PERSONAL GROOMING Relevant Knowledge Personal grooming is the art of cleaning, grooming, and maintaining parts of the body. Importance of Personal Grooming Personal grooming is important for a positive self -image and every effort should be made to encourage and assist the resident to maintain a pleasing and attractive appearance. It is the process of making yourself looks neat and attractive. The things which you do to make yourself and your appearance tidy and pleasant. Grooming is important for a positive self -image and to encourage and assist the resident to maintain a pleasing and attractive appearance. Basic Grooming Basic grooming involves practices that are followed daily to keep healthy and to make effective presentation. Some of these practices are as follows: Groom your facial hair. Avoid the patchy beard, long black mustache hairs, or chin pube goatee. Brush your teeth. Wash your hair. Take care of your skin. Trim your fingernails and toenails, and clean the dirt out from under them. Wear deodorant. Pay attention to little details like keeping your ears clean, or your nose hair trimmed, or not having a mole with a single distracting long hair growing out of it. Use effective communication skills while speaking to the patient and their relatives. Wear name badge and uniform. Basic Dressing Again, a list of stereotypical mistakes: Don't wea r white socks with dark shoes and vice versa. Don't wear socks with sandals. Don't wear T -shirts that are too big and baggy, or too small and tight. Don't wear the same outfit two days or more in a row. Don't wear a similar, uninspired outfit every day (i.e., a dull black t -shirt with jeans.) Don't keep wearing your clothes after they have become faded. Don't wear clothes that are overly wrinkled. Don't keep wearing something if you have dirtied or staine d it. 72 Basic Appearance Get your hair looking good. Grow it out or cut it in a fashionable style. Good looking hair can be the cornerstone of an attractive appearance. If you wear glasses, make sure to get some frames that look good on you. If you do not have great teeth, see what you can do about that. Of course this is not something anyone can do in five minutes. Get in shape, but do not think you absolutely have to get huge, shredded muscles. Take up rock climbing, or kick boxing, or dancing. Pick something you enjoy doing and that is not an unnecessary hassle to take part in. Exercise I. Perform activities for demonstrating good grooming habits. Assessment Short Answer Questions 1.

Medical treatment is not just providing treatment to sick patients but extends to well-being of the people in community and includes disease prevention and promoting good health, and lifestyle habits. There evolved a specific goals and objectives for maintaining health of an individual as well as community. To achieve these objectives appropriate systems need to be developed to measures taken to prevent diseases on one hand and promote good health on other side with provision for treatment of diseases on other side. Various studies indicated that significant population in India borrows money to meet their healthcare costs which are sudden and unexpected. A large population every year moves below poverty line in India and healthcare expenses being one of the major reasons. Thus the progress of the country depen ds on strong health system and preventive health. It is essential to develop good systems to include preventive health, have effective immunization, provide adequate understanding and care for maternal and child health, effective reimbursement or insurance mechanism to reimburse the costs of medical treatment, mechanism to manage epidemics and good emergency transport system to provide prehospital care during emergencies. Primary Health Care Health is defined as \"State of complete physical, mental and soci al well -being and not merely an absence of disease or infirmity\". Primary Health Care is medical care available to people at first level, it combines all the available medical facilities at the community for improving health status. Primary Health Care is defined as an essential healthcare based on scientific methods, universally accessible to the individuals and family in community at a cost which community and country can afford. It is the first level of contact of the individuals and integrates the famil y and the community with the national health system bringing healthcare as close as possible to where people live and work which includes awareness on preventive health, first level care at the community, immunization, alerts awareness and precautions in c ase of epidemics, referral of patients to appropriate care facility, supportive supervision and guidance and logistic support and supplies. Primary Health Care is conceived as an integral part of the country's plan for socio -economic development. In India Primary Health Care is delivered by individual doctors in private sector and infrastructure in public sector comprising of Village level Accredited Social Health Activist (commonly known as ASHA), Village level ANM, Sub Centers and Primary Health Centers. Millennium Development Goals The eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) adopted by the United Nations in the year 2000 called for concerted action to improve global health and their indicators. All 189 United Nations member states and at least 23 international organizations have agreed to achieve these goals by the year 2015. Session 1: Describe Essential Components of Primary Healthcare 76 Multiple indicators were identified to be arranged in patterns to compare health status of various areas, regions, states, countries. Efforts are made in the direction to better parameters, in last decade efforts are giving results. The goals are: 1. Eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. 2. Achieving universal primary education. 3. Promoting gender equality and empowering women. 4. Reducing child mortality rates. 5. Improving maternal health. 6. Combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases. 7. Ensuring environmental sustainability. 8. Developing a global partnership for development.

Part C Performance Standards The performance standards may include, but not limited to: Performance Standards yes No Demonstrate the knowledge of identifying the need of Primary Healthcare. Health Care Services 79 Session 2: Demonstrate Chain of Survival Relevant Knowledge In our day -to-day life we come across many medical emergencies; in few medical emergencies we come across unconscious / unresponsive patients, or seriously ill patients who need attention and no immediate professional medical help is available. In such case every second counts. Under such circumstances, it is quite common that everyone attempts to help in their own way to rescue the victim. Instead if one, who is a qualified first aider or doctor takes lead and adopts a standard approach to respond, it would increase the chances of survival. Emergency Medical Response Medical Emergency is any medical condition which has a sudden onset, unexpected occurrence needs attention, may be a dangerous may possess an immediate risk to person's life, limb, organ or long term health. Considering the emergency situation and availabi lity of resources, the Emergency Medical Response varies. However a standardized approach with sequential steps, well reinforced in the society and healthcare provider, followed systematically helps in increasing chances of survival and faster recover y. Emergency Medical Response is standard medical response by a first responder or qualified medical professional based on his competency provided to emergency victim which would help in increasing the chances of survival. Chain of Survival In life threatening events in out of hospital scenarios, when one comes across an unconscious patient or seriously ill patients (appears to have dead) there are series of actions, if put into action would increase the chances of survival of the patient. Th ese series of action are termed as \"Chain of Survival\" in various resuscitation guidelines. Courtesy :http://www.cardiaid.com/en/Home,1.html Figure:1 80 Step 1 Ensure Scene Safety: In emergency resuscitation the first principle is safety, unless you are safe, you can't provide help to others. Ensure the location is safe for yourself, the victim who is in emergency condition and also the bystanders around. Step 2 Check for response from Victim: It is essential to understand if the victim is conscious and is able to respond. To check this gently shake his shoulder and ask him loudly \"Are you O.K\", \"Can you hear me\". Step 3 Check for Response: If he responds, ensure he is in position in which you find him, ensure there is no further danger from surroundings, try to identify the cause and provide necessary help, seek for medical attention and try to transfer him to a medical facility as early as possible. If he doesn't respond, then Immediately shout for help Turn him onto his back Open Airway using head tilt and chin lift method Place your hand on his forehead and gently tilt his head back With your finger tips under the point of victim's chin, lift the chin to open the airway. Keeping the airway open Look - Look for chest movement Listen - At the victim's mouth for breath sounds Feel for breathing - Feel for air on your cheek Identify if breathing is normal, not normal or absent. If breathing normally, turn him into appropriate position (side position with head dependent, with no pressure on the chest) ensuring the position is stable. Also ensure that there is no obstruction to breathing. Seek help, Call for Ambulance, Call National Ambulance Service Telephone Numbers i.e. 108 or 102 or any other Ambulance Service available. Continue to assess breathing, check if breathing is normal. If the breathing is not normal or absent, alert the ambulance service, attempt to bring an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) if available, and attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR). (CPR method would be taught to you in subsequent NSQF levels). The simple model of Emergency Medical Response can be represented as below, further it is followed by CPR which would be taught in subsequent levels.

Activity: Enlisting of disease covered under Universal Immunization Programme. 85 Health Care Services Session 1: Differentiate Between Various Types of Immunity Relevant Knowledge The immune system is your body's way of helping to protect you from infection. When your body is infected by viruses, bacteria or other infectious organisms (e.g. a fungus or parasite), it undergoes a process of fighting the infection and then healing itself. As a result of this, the next time your body encounters the same organism, you will be 'immune' to this infection. This means that you are less likely to get the same disease again, or if you do, the infection will be less severe. This is the principle behind vaccination. How Does Immunity Work? Whenever your body encounters a foreign organism, like bacteria or a virus, a complicated set of responses are set in motion. Your body has two sets of defensive mechanisms, one called 'innate immunity' and another called 'adaptive immunity'. Innate Immunity Innate immunity describes your body's barriers to infection that are in -built (or innate). This includes: Skin The acid in your stomach Saliva Tears Mucus in your mouth and nose Cells in your blood stream that can destroy bacteria. All of these systems are extremely important as a first line of defence to prevent you from becoming infected, and for getting rid of the infections that you do get. These innate systems do not change with multiple exposures to the same infection; there is no 'learned' response no matter how many times your body is exposed to the same organism. Adaptive Immunity Your body's more complicated second line of defence is called adaptive immunity. By adapting to fight infections from particular bacteria or viruses, your body can become immune to infections caused by the same organism in the future. This adaptation by your body to prevent infection is the basis of immunization. Certain types of blood cells can learn from exposure to an infection. This means that the next time they encounter that infection they can remember it and mount a faster and stronger response. For Example: Antibodies are made by the body in response to an infecting organism. Th ey can recognise specific types of viruses or bacteria. They work by attaching themselves to the organism, and preventing them from infecting your body. 86 Session 2: Describe Immunization Schedule Relevant Knowledge What is Immunization? Immunization protects children (and adults) against harmful infections, before they come into contact with them in the community. Immunization uses the body's natural defense mechanism, the immune response, to build resistance to specific infections. Nine diseases can be prevented by routine childhood immunization - diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, poliomyelitis (polio), measles, mumps, rubella, haemophilus influenza type b (Hib) and hepatitis B. All of these dis eases can cause serious complications and sometimes death. Immunization is given as an injection or in the case of polio vaccine, taken as drops by mouth. Immunization helps children stay healthy by preventing serious infections. Immunization and Vaccinat ion Technically 'vaccination' is the term used for giving a vaccine, that is, actually getting the vaccine injected or swallowing the drops. 'Immunization' is the term used for the process of both getting the vaccine and becoming immune to is the diseas e as a result of the vaccine. Most people use the terms 'vaccination' and 'immunization interchangeably but their meanings are not exactly the same because immunity follows vaccination in most, but not all, cases. For the purposes of this workbook, we ha ve always used the term 'immunization' because this is the expression most commonly used in the community. How Does Immunization Work? All forms of immunization work in the same way. When someone is injected with, or swallows, a vaccine, their body produces an immune response in the same way it would following exposure to a disease but without the person getting the disease. If the person comes in contact with the disease in the future, the body is able to make an immune response fast enough to prevent the person getting sick. What is Vaccine? A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease causing microorganism, and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as foreign, destroy it, and \"remember\" it, so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines may be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g. vaccines against cancer are also being investigated. The term vaccine derives from Edward Jenner's 1796 use of cowpox (Latin variola vaccinia, adapted from the Latin vaccinus, from vacca, cow) to inoculate humans, providing them protectio n against smallpox. Health Care Services 87 Macrophages are specialised blood cells that can directly attack and destroy an infecting organism, digesting them so they cannot produce disease. Vaccines trigger the adaptive immune system by stimulating the body to make antibodies, so that it can prepare for a potential infection in the future. Passive immunity is acquired through transfer of antibodies or activated T -cells from an immune host, a nd is short lived, usually lasting only a few months, whereas active immunity is induced in the host itself by antigen and lasts much longer, sometimes lifelong. Exercise 1. Prepare a presentation on \"how does the immune system works?\" Assessment Short Answer Questions 1. What is immunity? _______________________________________________________________ 2. State the difference between innate immunity and adaptive immunity? Checklist for Assessment Activity Use the following checklist to see if you have met all the requirements for assessment activity: Part A I. Differentiate between innate immunity and adaptive immunity. Part B Discussed in class the following: 1. What is immunity? 2. What are the differences be tween innate immunity and adaptive immunity? 3. What is virus? 4. What is bacterium? 88 How Long Do Immunizations Take to Work? In general, the normal immune response takes several weeks to work. This means protection from an infection will not occur immediately after immunization. Most immunizations need to be given several times to build long lasting protection. A child who has b een given only one or two doses of diphtheria -tetanus -pertussis vaccine (DTPa) is only partially protected against diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus, and may become sick if exposed to these diseases. How long do immunizations last? The protective effect of immunizations is not always life-long. Some, like tetanus vaccine, can last up to 30 years, after this time a booster dose may be given. Some immunizations, such as whooping cough, give protection for about five years after a full cour se. Is Everyone Protected from Disease by Immunization? Even when all the doses of a vaccine have been given, not everyone is protected against the disease. Measles, mumps, rubella, tetanus, polio and Hib vaccines protect more than 95% of children who have completed the course. Three doses of whooping cough vaccine protects about 85% of children who have been immunized, and will reduce the severity of the disease in the other 15% of children (who have also been immunized), if they do catch whooping coug h. Booster doses are needed because immunity decreases over time. Three doses of hepatitis B vaccine protect over 95% of children. Why do Children Get So Many Immunizations? A number of immunizations are required in the first few years of a child's life to protect the child against the most serious infections of childhood. The immune system in young children does not work as well as the immune system in older children and adults, because it is still immature. Therefore, more doses of the vaccine are needed. In the first months of life, a baby is protected from most infections by antibodies from her or his mother which are transferred to the baby during pregnancy. When these antibodies wear off, the baby is at risk of serious infections and so the first immunizations are given before these antibodies have gone. What are the Side Effects of Immuni zation? Common side effects of immunization are redness and soreness at the site of injections and mild fever. While these symptoms may concern you and upset your child at the time, the benefit of immunization is protection from the disease. Paracetamol might be required to help ease the fever and soreness. Other side effects are very rare but if they do occur, a doctor should be consulted immediately. What is the Importance of Immunization? Each year, vaccines prevent more than 2.5 million child deaths globally. An additional 2 million child deaths could be prevented each year through immunization with currently available vaccines. Immunization saves a child's life: Immunization helps to protect your child against various diseases. Health Care Services 89 Immunization is safe and effective: All vaccines that are given to children are completely safe and effective, as various medical professionals have tested them. The only discomfort can be pain, redness or tender feeling among few. Immunization prevents sp read of diseases: If a person is immunized, there is little to risk of an epidemic. Thus, it also prevents spreading of the disease. Immunization saves time and money: A prolonged illness can take a toll on your finance as well as your precious time. Immunization is a good investment, as it saves time, money and promotes good health. Immunization protects future: Immunization has helped to eradicate polio to some extent. If we keep on practicing immunization, in near future we will be able to eradicate all these diseases completely. Immunisation has reduced mortality rate. Immunisation has made children more healthy and fit. Immunisation promotes long life span.

Relevant Knowledge Universal Immunization Program, popularly known as UIP, gained momentum in 1985 and it was implemented in phased manner to cover all districts in India by 1989 -90. Immunization is one of the key areas under National Rural Healt h Mission of Government of India. Since 1997, immunization activities have been an important component of National RCH Programme. Certain diseases may require universal immunization of a population to control them. Such efforts usually target infants in th e first year of life so that immunity is completed as early as possible before the risk of infection, (e.g., diphtheria -pertussis -tetanus, polio). Others may require immunization of only selected high risk groups (e.g., at risk elderly for Pneumococcus). I n some cases the target group may not be the group that the vaccine is designed to protect (e.g., rubella vaccination of all children and females of child bearing age in order to protect the fetus).Since there are regional differences in infection rates an d severity of every disease, the choice of vaccine and dosage regimen will vary with the local epidemiology of the disease, specific target population, and health system. The effectiveness of the healthcare delivery system can also vary with different vacc ines, vaccine efficacy, and organization of the local health care service organization. Care must be taken to ensure the balance of risks and benefits, where cost constraints or logistical limitations make continuous universal immunization impossible. Diseases Prevented through Vaccines used in the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) Presently, the Universal Immunization Program in India provides vaccines mainly to children below 5 years of age and pregnant women for the following preventable diseases: 1. Tuberculosis 2. Poliomyelitis 3. Diphtheria Session 3: Describe Key Components of Universal Immunization Programme 92 4. Pertussis (whooping cough) 5. Measles 6. Tetanus 7. Hepatitis B 8. Japanese encephalitis (in endemic districts) Vitamin A is not a vaccine, but a nutritional supplement which prevents many deficiencies related conditions. However, administration of Vitamin A is also a part of the Universal Immunization Program. Some other diseases have combined vaccines so as to avo id multiple shots, for example DPT for Diphtheria, Pertussis and Tetanus. This is also called a triple antigen. A pentavalent vaccine (5 vaccines together) is also being considered for introduction in the UIP. This will include DPT+ Hepatitis B vaccine+ va ccine for Haemophilus B.

Session 4: Pulse Polio Immunization Programme Relevant Knowledge Pulse Polio is an immunization campaign established by the government of India in 1995 -96 to eradicate poliomyelitis (polio) in India by vaccinating all children under the age of five years against polio virus. This project deals with the ways to fight poliomyelitis through a large scale immunization programme, co-operating with various international institutions, state governments and Non -governmental organization. 94 In India, vaccination against Polio started in 1978 with Expanded Program in Immunization (EPI). By 1984, it was successful in covering around 40% of all infants, giving 3 doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) to each. In 1985, the Universal Immunization Program (UIP) was launched to cover all the districts of the country. UIP became a part of child safe and survival motherland program (CSSM) in 1992 and Reproductive and Child Health Program (RCH) in 1997. This program led to a significant increase in coverage, up to 95%. The number of reported cases of polio also declined from 28,757 during 1987 to 3,265 in 1995. In 1995, following the Polio Eradication Initiative of World Health Organization (1988), India launched Pulse Polio Immunization Program along with Universal Immunization Program which aimed at 100% coverage. In 2012, India was declared free of polio by WHO. Importance of Pulse Polio Programme The Polio viruses are three related enteroviruses: type 1, 2 and 3. All three types cause paralysis. Type 1 causes paralysis most frequently. Polio is highly communicable having incubation period of 7 -10 days. Transmission is primarily person -to-person via the faecal -oral route; i.e. the poliovirus multiplies in the intestines and is spread through the faeces. The virus is intermittently excreted for one month or more after infection. Communicability of infected children is highest just prior to the onset of paralysis and during the first two weeks after paralysis occurs. Protective immunity against poliovirus infection develops by immunization or natural infection. Polio usually begins with common symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, and muscle pains and spasms and is followed by a more serious and permanent paralysis in one or more limbs. More than half of all polio cases occur in children under the age of five. Between 5 and 10 percent of infected persons display only the most general symptoms while more than 90 percent show no sign of illness at all. Polio vaccine is highly effective in produ cing immunity to the poliovirus and protection from paralytic polio. Approximately 90 percent or more of polio vaccine recipients develop protective antibodies to all three poliovirus types after two doses, and at least 99 percent are immune following three doses. Dr. Albert Sabin developed Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV). Presently, almost all countries use OPV to achieve polio eradication target. The vaccine not only prevents pernicious infection in the person, but it al so precludes transmission of the wild poliovirus to other person. Since polio virus cannot survive outside a host for more than two weeks, theoretically it would be wiped out, resulting in the eradication of poliomyelitis. For those who infected by the polio virus, there is no cure as such but there is treatment to alleviate the symptoms. Besides this, the affected persons can also be rehabilitated with the help of modern mobility aids. Heat and physical therapy can help to stimulate the muscles of infecte d persons and antispasmodic drugs are prescribed to relax the muscles. While this can improve mobility, it cannot reverse permanent polio paralysis. Health Care Services 95 India launched the Pulse Polio Immunization (PPI) programme in 1995 as a result of the WHO Global Polio Eradication Initiative. Under this programme, all children under five years are given two doses of Oral Polio Vaccine (OPV) in December and January every year until polio is eradicated. The campaign proved to be successful, and the incidence of poliomyelitis in India has decreased dramatically. The PPI was initiated with an objective of achieving hundred percent coverage under OPV. It aims to reach the unreached children through improved social mobilization, plan mop-up operations in areas where poliovirus has almost disappeared and maintain high level of morale among the public. Key Components of Pulse Polio Immunization Programme Polio has been eradicated from most of the world using several key strategies. Each of the following strategies is important components in the National Polio Eradication Programme: (a) Routine Immunization: Sustaining high levels of coverage with 3 doses of oral polio vaccine in the 0 -1 year age group. (b) Supplementary Immunization Activities (SIAs): Simultaneous administration of oral polio vaccine to all children in the age group of 0 -5 years, 4 -6 weeks apart to interrupt wild poliovirus transmission and to in crease immunity amongst children. SIAs include: National Immunization Days (NIDs) when the entire country is covered Sub National Immunization Days (SNIDs) when some states or parts of states are covered. Mop-ups are conducted, as soon as possible after id entification of the virus as an end game strategy to interrupt transmission. (c) Surveillance and investigation of cases of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) Surveillance data is used to identify areas of wild poliovirus transmission and to guide immunization activities.

Health Care Services 99 Session 1: Describe Elements of Communication Relevant Knowledge The term 'communication' originates from the Latin word \"communicare\", which means to share or impart. When used as per its function, it means a common ground of understanding. Communication is the process of exchanging of facts, ideas and opinions and a m eans that individuals or organisations use for sharing meaning and understanding with one another. In other words, it is the transmission and interaction of facts, ideas, opinions, feelings or attitudes. It is also a means of interacting linguistically in an appropriate way in a range of societal, cultural and work context. It is the use of messages to produce meaning within and across a variety of contexts, cultures, methods and media. It is an important way through which facts, ideas, e xperiences and feelings are shared and exchanged. Primates and other animals have been communicating without the use of language since long before humans invented verbal communication. Humans communicate both verbally and non-verbally. Verbal communicatio n includes written and oral communication, whereas non -verbal communication includes body language, facial expression and pictures. Written communication is an effective tool for recording, reporting and management. The recording and reporting of informati on should be done in a systematic way. Our own beliefs, values and behaviour interact with each other and it reflects in our style of communication. Communicating in an effective manner, irrespective of the mode of communication used is a skill. Effective communication occurs only if the receiver understands the exact information or idea that the sender intended to transmit. It involves the use of proper equipment, providing information to the appropriate people and carrying out communication effectiv ely. Breakdown in communication is either due to lack of skills in communicating or lack of coherent thought process. It can also happen due to the breakdown of the communication network. In this Unit you will learn about communication cycle, the var ious forms of communication barriers and how to communicate effectively. Different Elements of Communication Communication has three important parts - transmitting, listening and feedback. The sender transmits the message through one medium or another. The receiver listens to the message and then conveys his understanding of the message to the sender in the form of feedback to complete the communication cycle. The process of conveying a message is complete only when the person receiving it has understood the message in its entirety. To understand the communication process better we need to familiarize ourselves with the communication cycle (Fig.1). Let us now try to understand what we mean by communication cycle. 100 The communication cycle in essence is the process of communication. The \"sender\" \"encodes\" the message into words and sent the coded message as he/she speaks or writes the \"message\" out. Message is convey ed through channels including telephone, video -conferencing, letters, emails, meetings, memos, records and reports. It is then \"decoded\" by the \"receiver\" by hearing or reading the message in order to understand what the sender wants to convey. In an effective communication cycle, the receiver understands the language and the message in the same way that the sender meant it to be. The words, tonal quality, body language, all convey the same message and nothing gets distorted or lost in the process of sending it and the receiver is able to relay back exactly what was intended to be conveyed to him/her. Let us look at each of the elements of the communication cycle individually. Sender: The sender gives or encodes the message, for example the sender greets a visitor or a client by saying \"Good morning Sir/Madam\". Message: The message in this case is \"Good morning Sir/Madam\", which is also known as the content of the communication. Medium: It is the channel used for communication. It may-be in any of the following forms - verbal, non -verbal, pictorial, symbolic or written. Receiver: The receiver decodes the incoming message, or expression, translates and presents an output in the form of a response or reaction. Feedback: How the receiver responds or reacts is known as feedback. It is the effect, reply or reaction to the information being transmitted. Communication is understood and acted upon at different degrees of effectiveness. A communication is effective when the experience of both the communicator and receiver is satisfying and the goal of the interaction is achieved and vice-versa. Figure : 1 Communication Cycle 3 Message sent 4 Message received 5 Message decoded 2 Message coded 6 Message understood 1 Idea occurs Health Care Services 101 Six essential principles of an effective communication are as follows: 1. The information should be delivered in a clear message. 2. Message should be delivered timely. 3. Message should be complete. 4. Message should be concise. 5. Message should be factual. 6. Message should be accurate. Providing Feedback Feedback conveys to the sender, the effectiveness of his/her communication. For individuals who are not trained in communication skills, providing feedback is unconscious. However, when indiv iduals are trained in communication, feedback is a tool for both the listener and the sender to make the communication effective. Similarly, the listener has the opportunity to respond (thus giving feedback to the sender) with a clarification to ensure the accuracy of listening. Therefore, in order to ensure that the discrepancy between what is spoken and what is understood is minima l, the communication should not only be accurate, brief and clear, but adequate feedback should be sought or provided. Feedback is also a way of helping another person to consider changing his behaviour. For instance, in the case of mobile service operators, there is a system of feedback through Short Service Message (SMS) and Electronic Mails (Emails), which helps the company and also the individual at the customer care centre to improve upon t he communication and relationship with the customer. Giving and receiving feedback are skills that can be learnt. Let us now look at the characteristics of feedback. Some of the characteristics of feedback are as follows: It is descriptive, rather than eva luative: Descriptive feedback mentions the behaviour that needs to change, whereas evaluative feedback makes judgments which do not help in changing behaviour. For example, \"Please get all the columns filled in by the visitor in the logbook every time a visitor enters the gates\" is a descriptive feedback, whereas \"You are irresponsible as you did not get the columns filled in by the visitors.\" is an example of evaluative feedback. It is specific, rather than general: The feedback should be specific as the receiver should know specifically the area that needs to be handled. For example, if the sender says, 'Please update the records', the message is too general and does not indicate what is to be specifically done in record keeping. On the other hand, if the sender says \"Please get all the columns filled in by the visitor in the logbook every time a visitor enters the gates\" then the receiver knows that he/she is supposed to get all the columns filled in by the visitors. It is directed to changeable behaviour: Feedback that suggests alternative ways of behaving allows individuals to choose and own the changed behaviour. This ensures that the behaviour change is permanent. For example, saying \"A 102 useful way of filling up of the visitor's logbook is to get the visitor to fill it, while you observe to ensure the accuracy\" enables the person to take initiative and either follows the suggestion or come up with their own way of getting it done. However, saying, \"You should be more prompt in record keeping\" or \"The real problem is that you are not prompt\" does not provide options to the listener to change to the desirable behaviour. It is solicited, rather than imposed: Feedback is most useful when the receiver himself/herself has formulated the kind of questions, which those observing him/her can answer. It is well -timed: In general, feedback is most useful if it is timely or given at the earliest opportunity. It is checked to ensure clear communication: In order to check whether the receiver has been conveyed the message clearly, the receiver can be asked to rephrase the feedback he/she has received to see if it corresponds to what the sender has in mind. Three aspects that you should always consider while giving a constructive feedback are as follows: (i) Give neutral and honest (stick to facts) observations. (ii) Propose an alternative or give examples to prove your point. (iii) Show the benefits of the alternative. Three aspects of feedback that you should always consider while receiving feedback are as follows: (i) Listen carefully what the other person has to say. (ii) Ask questions, if you need any clarifications. (iii) Do not become defensive or emotional. Exercise 1. Listen to t he English programmes on radio. 2. Read newspapers daily.

As simple as communication seems, much of what we try to communicate to others, and what others try to communicate to us gets misunderstood, which can cause conflict and frustration in personal and professional relationships. By learning these effective communication skills, you can better connect with your spouse, kids, friends, and coworkers. Effec tive Communication In the information age, we have to send, receive, and process huge numbers of messages every day. But effective communication is about more than just exchanging information. It is also about understanding the emotion behind the information. Effective communication can improve relationships at home, work, and in social situations by deepening your connections to others and improving teamwork, decision -making, and problem solving. It enables you to communicate even negative or diff icult messages without creating conflict or destroying trust. Effective communication combines a set of skills including nonverbal communication, attentive listening, the ability to manage stress in the moment, and the capacity to recognize and understand your own emotions and those of the person you are communicating with. A speech that is read, for example, rarely has the same impact as a speech that is delivered (or appears to be delivered) spontaneously. Of course, it takes time and effort to develop these skills and become an effective communicator. The more effort and p ractice you put in, the more instinctive and spontaneous your communication skills will become. Effective Communication Skills # 1: Listening Listening is one of the most important aspects of effective communication. Successful listening means not just understanding the words or the information being communicated, but also understanding how the speaker feels about what they are communicating. Effective listening can make the speaker feel heard and understood which can help build a stronger, deeper connection between the speaker and the listener. Create an environment where everyone feels safe to express ideas, opinions, and feelings, or plan a nd problem solve in creative ways. Save time by helping clarify information, avoid conflicts and misunderstandings. When emotions are running high, if the speaker feels that he or she has been truly heard, it can help to calm them down, relieve negative feelings, and allow for real understanding or problem solving to begin. Health Care Services 105 Tips for Effective Listening If your goal is to fully understand and connect with the other person, listening effectively will often come naturally. If it does not, you can remember the following tips. The more you practice them, the more satisfying and rewarding your interactions with others will become. Focus fully on the speaker, his or her body language, and other nonverbal cues. If you are daydreaming, checking text messages, or doodling, you are almost certain to miss nonverbal cues in the conversation. If you find it hard to concentrate on some speakers, try repeating their words over in your head it will reinforce their message and help you stay focus ed. Avoid interrupting or trying to redirect the conversation to your concerns, by saying something like, \"If you think that's bad, let me tell you what happened to me.\" Listening is not the same as waiting for your turn to talk. You can't concentrate on what someone's saying if you are forming what you are going to say next. Often, the speaker can read your facial expressions and know that your mind's elsewhere. Avoid seeming judgmental: In order to communicate effectively with someon e, you do not have to like them or agree with their ideas, values, or opinions. However, you do need to set aside your judgment and withhold blame and criticism in order to fully understand a person. The most difficult communication, when successfully exec uted, can lead to the most unlikely and profound connection with someone. Show your interest in what is being said. Nod occasionally, smile at the person, and make sure your posture is open and inviting. Encourage the speaker to continue with small verbal comments like \"yes\". Effective Communication Skills # 2: Managing Stress When stress strikes, you cannot always temper it by taking time out to meditate or go for a run, especially if you are in the middle of a meeting with your boss or an argument with your spouse, for example. By learning to quickly reduce stress in the moment, though, you can safely face any strong emotions you are experiencing, regulate your feelings, and behave appropriately. When you know how to maintain a relaxed, energized state of awareness -even when something upsetting happens - you can remain emotionally available and engaged. In small doses, stress can help you perform under pressure. However, when stress becomes constant and overwhelming, it can hamper effective communication by disrupting your capacity to think clearly and creatively, and act appropriately. When you are stressed, you are more likely to misread other people, send confusing or off -putting nonverbal signals, and lapse into unhealthy knee -jerk patterns of behaviour. How many times have you felt stressed during a disagreement with your spouse, kids, boss, friends, or coworkers and then said or done something you later regretted? If you can quickly relieve stress and return to a calm state, you will not only avoid such regrets, but in many cases you will also help to calm the other person as well. It is only when you are in a calm, relaxed state that you will be able 106 to know whether the situation requires a response, or whether the other person's signals indicate it would be better to remain silent. Recognize when you are becoming stressed. Your body will let you know if you are stressed as you communicate. Are your muscles or your stomach tight and/ or sore? Are your hands clenched? Is your breath shallow? Are you \"forgetting\" to breathe? Take a moment to calm down before deciding to continue a conversation or postpone it. Bring your senses to the rescue and quickly manage stress by taking a few deep breaths, clenching and relaxing muscles, or recalling a soothing, sensory -rich image, for example. The best way to rapidly and reliably relieve stre ss is through the senses: sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell. But each person responds differently to sensory input, so you need to find things that are soothing to you. Look for humour in the situation. When used appropriately, humour is a great way to relieve stress when communicating. When you or those around you start taking things too seriously, find a way to lighten the mood by sharing a joke or amusing story. Be willing to compromise. Sometimes, if you can both bend a little, you'll be able to find a happy middle ground that reduces the stress levels for everyone concerned. If you realize that the other person cares much more about something than you do, compromise may be easier for you and a good investment in the future of the relationship. Agree to disagree, if necessary, and take time away from the situation so everyone can calm down. Take a quick break and move away from the situation. Go for a stroll outside if possible, or spend a few minutes meditating. Physical movement or finding a quiet place to regain your balance can quickly reduce stress. Effective Communication Skills #3: Emotional Awareness Emotions play an important role in the way we communicate at home and work. It is the way you feel, more than the way you think, that motivates you to communicate or to make decisions. The way you react to emotionally driven, nonverbal cues affects both ho w you understand other people and how they understand you. If you are out of touch with your feelings, and do not understand how you feel or why you feel that way, you will have a hard time communicating your feelings and needs to others. This can result i n frustration, misunderstandings, and conflict. When you do not address what is really bothering you, you often become embroiled in petty squabbles instead - arguing with your spouse about how the towels should be hung, for example, or with a coworker about whose turn it is to restock the copier. Emotional awareness provides you the tools needed for understanding both yourself and other people, and the real messages they are communicating to you. Although knowing your own feelings may seem simple, many peop le ignore or try to sedate strong emotions like anger, sadness, and fear. But your ability to communicate depends on being connected to these feelings. If you are afraid of strong emotions or Health Care Services 107 if you insist on communicating only on a rational level, it will impair your ability to fully understand others, creatively problem solve, resolve conflicts, or build an affectionate connection with someone. Emotional Awareness Helps you: Understand and e mpathize with what is really troubling other people. Understand yourself, including what's really troubling you and what you really want. Stay motivated to understand and empathize with the person you're interacting with, even if you do not like them or their message. Communicate clearly and effectively, even when delivering negative messages. Build strong, trusting, and rewarding relationsh ips, think creatively, solve problems, and resolve conflicts. Effective Communication Requires Both Thinking and Feeling When emotional awareness is strongly developed, you will know what you are feeling without having to think about it -and you will be able to use these emotional cues to understand what someone is really communicating to you and act accordingly. The goal of effective communication is to find a healthy balance between your intellect and your emotions, between thinking and feeling. Emotional Awareness is a Skill you can Learn Emotional awareness is a skill that, with patience and practice, can be learned at an y time of life. You can develop emotional awareness by learning how to get in touch with difficult emotions and manage uncomfortable feelings, including anger, sadness, fear, disgust, surprise, and joy. When you know how to do this, you can remain in control of your emotions and behaviour, even in very challenging situations, and communicate more clearly and effectively. Applying Elements of Verbal and Non -verbal Communication Verbal communication uses words as the medium of communication. An effectiv e verbal communication is a two -way process; speaking and listening must occur. Usually verbal communication is in the one -to-one mode or one -to-one interaction. An important factor in verbal communication at a distance is the fact that the two communicators are not facing each other. The sender can only use words and tone of voice to communicate with the receiver. Not being able to see the body language of the receiver is a disadvantage. It is very important to maintain accuracy, brevity and clarity in verbal communication. The sender should also ensure that he speaks clearly into the instrument and also conveys respect through his choice of words. Let us no w see how we can speak clearly. The acronym RSTP is a useful guide for speaking clearly. R - Rhythm - Maintaining rhythm while speaking is important for communicating effectively. Pauses in speech allow the speaker the time to think of his/her next thought, and also provide the listener enough time to process the information. 108 S - Speech - It is the act of delivering a formal spoken communication to an audien ce. T - Tone - Tone is the quality of sound that portrays feelings or changes in meaning. A monotone delivery could indicate that a speaker is fed up. An emphatic tone might reveal interest or anger. The statement: \"That is just great\" delivered in a normal tone would mean the speaker likes something. A speaker delivering this statement in a sarcastic tone: \"That is just GREAT\" would mean the opposite. P - Pitch - Pitch occurs because of the vibration of the human vocal cords. Changes in the tension of the vocal cords cause differences in pitch. Pitch in spoken language refers to the perceived frequency of sound. Higher frequencies of sound produce higher pitch than lower frequencies of sound. Usually, the pitch of women's voices is higher than that of men. Non-Verbal Communication It is the communication that uses physical parts of the body. It includes facial expressions, tone of voice, sense of touch, sense of smell, and body movements. By understanding the important aspects of non -verbal communication or body language, you can learn to read people more easily. Argyle and his associates have been studying the features of non -verbal communication that convey information. The following summarizes their findings: (a) Static Features 1. Distance: The distance one stands from another frequently conveys a non -verbal message. In some cultures it is a sign of attraction, while in others it may reflect status or the intensity of the warmth or feeling. In India, a foot away from another person is considered as a respectful distance while communicating. 2. Orientation: People may present themselves in various ways: face -to-face, side - to-side, or even back -to-back. For example, cooperating people are likely to sit side-by-side while competitors freq uently face one another. In the security sector, face-to-face orientation is common. 3. Posture: Your posture conveys message. For example if you are sitting on a chair with your legs crossed or our arms folded, then such postures convey a degree of relaxation in the communication exchange. For a security officer on duty, there are only two acceptable postures - attention and stand -at-ease. 4. Gestures with Hands and Arms: Shaking hands, touching, holding, embracing or patting on the back, all convey messages. They all reflect an element of intimacy. For instance, in case of people who have to be escorted out of the premises, physical contact can involve touching the hand or the shoulder to emphasize the message of moving from that area. (b) Dynamic Features 1. Facial Expressions: A smile, frown, raised eyebrow, yawn, and sneer all convey information. Facial expressions continually change during interaction and are Health Care Services 109 observed constantly by the recipient. There is evidence that the meaning of these expressions may be similar across cultu res. Smiling is considered to be pleasant and helpful. A frown conveys confusion and at times anger. Raised eyebrows, yawn, a sneer are all unacceptable body language, as they reflect anger or ignorance. 2. Gestures: One of the most frequently observed, but least understood cues is a hand movement. Most people use hand movements regularly when talking. Hands at the side or at the back are considered non-threatening, encouraging and acceptable. 3. Looking: A major feat ure of social communication is eye contact. Eye contact is crucial for effective communication. The frequency of contact may suggest either interest or boredom. For example, a Security Officer should look straight into the eyes of the person, although plea santly and affably. (c) Pictorial Communication It includes communicating with signs like traffic signals, the 21 -gun salute, horns, sirens, etc. For example, the sign of 'stop' tells you to stop at the given point, the sign of two children with school bags indicate the school zone, the sign of U -turn t ells you to take a U turn, and the sign of a person crossing the road indicates the place where you can cross the road. Figure: 2 (d) Symbolic Communication Symbolic communication uses symbols that signify religion, school, status, affiliation, communi cation devices, etc. Given below are some of the symbols used for symbolizing various communication devices. Figure: 3 110 Applying Principles of Effective Communication The principles of effective communication can be categorized as 7 C's, which are applicable to both written as well as oral communication. Let us now try to understand them one by one. 1. Clarity: Clarity is of utmost importance and communication by hospital support staff should have a definite purpose for communication. 2. Comprehensive: Little knowledge is dangerous and, therefore, it is imperative to include all the necessary facts and background information to support the message while communicating, more so, in hospitals. Totality of communication is integral to the process. 3. Conciseness: Brief and short pieces of communication ensure effective communication, however, one needs to keep in mind the reader's knowl edge of the subject and their time constraints. Information should be conveyed as quickly and easily as possible. 4. Concreteness: This element needs to be used with utmost care as it could lead to confusion. The message needs to be based on facts and be real. 5. Courtesy: Keeping the ambience of hospital in mind, courtesy needs to be given due credit for patient may arrive at hospital in a state of distress or traumatized. 6. Correctness: It is of utmost importance that all pieces of information released by hospital support staff are checked to ensure that it is accurate and timely. Double checking all information whether written or verbal, will ensure right communication occurs all the time. 7. Coherence: Logic and rationale need to be used while communicating. A delicate balance needs to be stroked in order to ensure effect communication. Sound and consistent communication will ensure that patient comes back. Barriers in Communication We learnt about the communication cycle and the feedback in the previous sessions. Let us now try to understand the various factors that not only influence communication, but may also act as barriers or deterrent to an effective communication. These factors can be broadly categorized as environmental, attitudinal, system design, individual linguistic ability, poor retention, inattention and emotional state. We will also look into some of the possible measures that you may adopt as solution(s) to overc ome the barriers. a. Environmental Factors Environmental factors that affect communication include noise and physical obstacles like distance and lack of proper instruments for communication. 1) Noise: Noise causes stress. Background noise and excessive echo are great distracters to listening, especially for the persons with poor concentration. Similarly use of loud speakers, noise from generators or other machinery interferes with communication. Health Care Services 111 Solution: Removing noise elements or sound proofing the area of verbal communication will improve communication. For example sound proofing is done in studios for sound isolation and noise blocking. 2) Physical Obstacles: Physical obstacles like distance and use of defective instruments for communication affects the effectiveness of communication. Poor lighting, uncomfortable seating arrangements and unhygienic room also affect communication. Solution: Development of expert ise in using instruments like telephone, fax machine and computers can help to overcome the barriers of distance. Checking the instrument before using it for communication is useful in avoiding unpleasant situation. B. attitudinal Factors Attitudinal factors that affect communication include cultural compulsions, fear of upsetting others, fear of rejection or ridicule like \"Don't speak unless you are asked to\", feeling responsible for the other person, circle of musts (ought to, must, have to), and low self i mage. Solution: Personality development training sessions can help you to develop abilities for removing attitudinal barriers and to make your communication effective. C. System Design 1. Time: Some functions are time sensitive and cannot be delayed. They however, may cause other procedures to be completed in haste and as a result communication could be hampered. Time pressures affect the ability to communicate. Solution: Manage your time and pace of communication to ensure effectiveness. 2. Information Overload: Overloading a person with a pool of information may result in confusion, misinterpretation and loss of information. Solution: Control information flow and document them, else the information is likely to be misinterpreted, forgotten or overlooked. 3. Complexity in Organisational Structure: Greater the hierarchy in an organisation (i.e. more the number of managerial levels), more are the chances of communication getting misinterpreted or destroyed. Solution: Keeping the levels few and ensuring systematic flow of information will reduce the problem of distortion in communication or communication breakdown. D. Individual Linguistic Ability 1. Individual Characteristics: Individual characteristics include biological f actors like lisping (a speech disorder characterized by the inability correctly pronounce the sounds of 's' for 'z', known as sibilant consonants), and educational factors like proficiency in language. Individual differences in terms of the knowledge of vocabulary, grammar, etc. affect communication effectiveness. Solution: Education and training in standard language scripts and their usage can reduce individual differences in linguistic ability. 112 2. Perceptual and Language Differences: Perception is generally how each individual interprets the world around him. Communication distortion occurs if there is wrong perception about the message. Solution: Rephrasing commu nication and checking for understanding helps in reducing barrier due to perceptual differences. E. Poor Retention Human memory cannot function beyond a limit. One can't always retain what is being told, especially if he/she is not interested or not attentive. This leads to communication breakdown. Solution: Use of notes, written messages, e -mails, etc. should be made to avoid communication breakdown. F. Inattention At times we do not listen, but only hear, especially when there are more important thing s to be taken care of. For instance, if a visitor comes to you at the same instance when you are answering the phone, then it is important to excuse yourself from the person on the phone so that exclusive attention can be given to the visitor or you may request the visitor to wait for some time. Solution: Use of numbering system helps in giving individual attention. Avoid jumping from one message to another without completing the former. G.
