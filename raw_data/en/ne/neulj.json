Origin and Epidemiology of HIV/AIDS UNAIDS reports that reaching Fast-Track Targets will avert nearly 28 million new HIV infections and end the AIDS epidemic as a global health threat b y 2030. If the world does not rapidly scale up in the next five years, the epidemic is likely to spring back with a higher rate of new HIV infections than today. UNAIDS, 2014aHuman Lymphocyte Showing HIV InfectionYour client, Mr. Glover, has been diagnosed with HIV. You don't know much about HIV and are concerned whether you can \"catch\" HIV by working with him or even shaking hands. You recognize your need to be better educated so you can give appropriate care without bias or fear. You know that quality care can be given when you have a sound understanding of the disease, risk factors, diagnostics, clinical symptoms, and treatments. Becoming culturally sensitive to the unique needs of your patients requires you to better understand your patient's values, definitions of health and illness, and preferences for care. Definitions of HIV and AIDS [Note: If not otherwise identified, material in this course is taken from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.] The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has infected tens of millions of people around the globe in the past three decades, with devastating results. In its advanced stage \u2014acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) \u2014the infected individual has no protection from diseases that may not even threaten people who have healthy immune systems. While medical treatment can delay the onset of AIDS, no cure is available for HIV or AIDS. The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) kills or impairs the cells of the immune system and progressively destroys the body's ability to protect itself. Over time, a person with a deficient immune system ( immunodeficiency ) may become vulnerable to common and even simple infections by disease-causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. These infections can become life-threatening. The term AIDS comes from \"acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.\" AIDS refers to the most advanced stage of HIV infection. Medical treatment can delay the onset of AIDS, but HIV infection eventually results in a syndrome of symptoms, diseases, and infections. The diagnosis of AIDS requires evidence of HIV infection and the appear ance of specific conditions or diseases beyond just the HIV infection. Only a licensed medical provider can make an AIDS diagnosis. A key concept is that all people diagnosed with AIDS have HIV, but an individual may be infected with HIV and not yet have AIDS. HIV-Infection in the BodyA scanning electron micrograph showing HIV-1 virions (in green) on the surface of a human lymphocyte. HIV was identified in 1983 as the pathogen responsible for AIDS. In the infected individual, the virus causes a depletion of T-cells, which leaves these patients susceptible to opportunistic infections and to certain malignancies. Source: Pu blic Health Image Library, image #11279, CDC, 1989. HIV \"Budding\" Out of a T-cell Source: NIAID, courtesy of Dr. Tom Folks.HIV enters the bloodstream and attacks T-helper lymphocytes , which are white blood cells essential to the functioning of the immune system. One of the functions of T -helper cells is to regulate the immune response in the ev ent of attack from disease-causing organisms such as bacteria or viruses. The T -helper lymphocyte cell is also called the T4 or the CD4 cell. When an y pathogen infects the T-helper lymphocyte, the T cell sends signals to other cells, which produce helpful antibodies. Antibodies (proteins made b y the immune system in response to infection) are produced b y the immune system to help get rid of specific foreign invaders that can cause disease. Producing antibodies is an essential function of our immune system. The body mak es a specific antibody for each pathogen. F or example, if we are exposed to the measles virus, the immune system will dev elop antibodies specifically designed to attack that virus. P olio antibodies fight the polio virus. A health y immune system creates customiz ed identification of pathogens, which results in the body' s abilit y to target and kill in vading microorganisms. When our immune system is working correctly , it protects against these foreign in vaders. HIV infects and destro ys the T -helper lymphocytes and damages their abilit y to signal for antibody production. This results in the ev entual decline of the immune system. The HIV is then able to reproduce without being killed from the body . CD4 counts therefore are of great importance to people with HIV to confirm their abilit y to fight infection. The normal r ange for CD4 is between 500 and 1,500. A CD4 count below 200 rev eals the body' s inabilit y to create antibodies and fight infection, putting the client at greater risk for AIDS and other potentially fatal opportunistic infections. Serum lab results ma y also express CD4 percentage, and a normal result in an HIV negativ e person is between 25% and 65%, identif ying that percentage of lymphocytes are CD4 cells. The remaining cells are other t ypes of lymphocytes also in volved in the immune attack against pathogens.Primary HIV Infection Primary HIV infection (acute HIV infection) is the first stage of HIV disease. It begins with initial infection and t ypically lasts only a week or two . During this time the virus is establishing itself in the body but the body has not yet begun to produce antibodies . Because of this, the infection cannot be identified b y any HIV tests. This period of acute infection is char acteriz ed by a high viral load (large numbers of the virus) and a decline in CD4 cells. Appro ximately half of infected patients experience clinical symptoms mimicking mononucleosis that include fev er and swollen glands during the primary infection, but the symptoms are not life-threatening and ma y be misinterpreted as a minor illness. During a primary infection, newly infected people can infect partners because they do not yet know they ha ve HIV . The primary infection period ends when the body begins to produce HIV -specific antibodies as the CD4 cells are still able to respond. The number of antibodies is still insufficient, howev er, to be detectable b y HIV testing. Answer: DTest Your Learning Primary HIV infection is: Online Resource Video (10:40): How HIV Kills So Many CD4 T Cells https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8gnpnUFNloo Window Period The window period is the period of time between initial infection with HIV and the point when the body produces detectable antibodies, which can vary from 2 to 12 weeks. During the window period a person is infectious, with a high viral load, but still presents with a negative HIV antibody test. This false negative test means the infected person might get a negative test result while actually having HIV. The point when the HIV antibody test becomes positive is called seroconversion. How HIV kills so many CD4 T cells | Infectious diHow HIV kills so many CD4 T cells | Infectious di ......The period beginning when AIDS is diagnosed.A. The time when antibodies are first detected.B. Referred to as the window period.C. The first weeks after infection when the body has not yet produced antibodies.D.Answer: ATest Your Learning The window period: Asymptomatic Stage After the acute stage of HIV infection, people infected with HIV continue to look and feel completely well for long periods, sometimes for man y years. During this time, the virus is replicating and slowly destro ying the immune system. This asymptomatic stage is sometimes referred to as clinical latency . This means that, although a person looks and feels health y, they can infect other people through an y body fluid contact such as unprotected anal, v aginal, or or al sex or through needle sharing. The virus can also be passed from an infected woman to her bab y during pregnancy , birth, or breastfeeding when she is una ware of being HIV positiv e. Unless the infected person is given antiretro viral ther apy, the onset of AIDS can occur an a verage of 10 y ears after being infected with HIV . Apply Your Learning Q: If a person has been infected with HIV but is not symptomatic, how would y ou explain this to a patient with HIV? A: Although there ma y be no clinical symptoms, the HIV is replicating and slowly attacking the immune system' s CD4 cells. An untreated person can look and feel health y, sometimes for man y years, howev er the virus is still present in the blood and can cause infection in others. Also , the virus can be passed through unprotected sex and from pregnant or lactating mother to child. The Origin of HIVIs the time between infection with HIV and the body' s production of detectable antibodies.A. Typically lasts only a week or two . B. Refers to the stage of disease when the newly infected person is not y et contagious.C. Is the first stage of HIV disease.D.Since the human immunodeficiency virus w as identified in 1983, researchers ha ve work ed to pinpoint the origin of the virus. In 1999 an international team of researchers reported that they disco vered the origins of HIV -1, the predominant str ain of HIV in the dev eloped world. A subspecies of chimpanz ees nativ e to W est Equatorial Africa w as identified as the original source of the virus. R esearchers believ e that HIV -1 was introduced into the human population when hunters became exposed to infected blood. The tr ansmission of HIV w as driven through Africa b y migr ation, housing, tr avel, sexual pr actices, drug use, w ar, and economics that affect both Africa and to the entire world. HIV Strains and Subtypes HIV is divided into two primary str ains: HIV-1 and HIV-2 . Worldwide, the predominant virus is HIV -1, and gener ally when people refer to HIV without specif ying the t ype of virus they are referring to HIV -1. The relativ ely uncommon HIV -2 type is concentr ated in W est Africa and is r arely found elsewhere. HIV is a highly v ariable virus that easily mutates. This means there are man y different strains of HIV , even within the body of a single infected person. Based on genetic similarities, the numerous vir al strains ma y be classified into t ypes, groups, and subt ypes. Both HIV -1 and HIV -2 ha ve sev eral subt ypes. It is certain that more undisco vered subt ypes already exist. It is also probable that more HIV subt ypes will ev olve in the future. As of 2001, blood testing in the United States can detect both str ains and all currently known subtypes of HIV . Epidemiology of HIV and AIDS Epidemiology is the study of how disease is distributed in populations and the factors that influence the distribution. Epidemiologists try to disco ver wh y a disease dev elops in some people and not in others. Clinically , AIDS w as first recogniz ed in the United States in 1981. In 1983 HIV w as disco vered to be the cause of AIDS . Since then, the number of AIDS cases has continued to increase both in the United States and in other countries. HIV and AIDS cases are reportable; each state has its own la ws and healthcare work ers must be familiar with those of the state in which they are licensed. The disco very of combination antivir al drug ther apies in 1996 resulted in a dr amatic decrease in the number of deaths due to AIDS among people giv en the drug ther apies. On the down side, man y people who ha ve access to the ther apies ma y not benefit from them or ma y not be able to toler ate the side effects. The medications are expensiv e and require strict dosing schedules. Furthermore, in dev eloping countries man y people with HIV have no access to the newer drug ther apies.People who are infected with HIV come from all r aces, countries, sexual orientations, genders, and income lev els. Globally , most of the people who are infected with HIV ha ve not been tested, and are una ware that they are living with the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prev ention (CDC) estimate that 1.2 million people aged 13 y ears and older are living with HIV infection, including 168,000 (14%) who are una ware of their infection. This is a decline from 25% in 2003 and 20% in 2012, and it is a positiv e sign because studies ha ve shown that people with HIV who know that they are infected a void behaviors that spread infection to others; also , they can get medical care and tak e antivir al medications that could ev entually reduce HIV spread b y as much as 96% (CDC, 2016a). CDC estimates that that there are only 4 tr ansmissions per y ear for ev ery 100 people living with HIV in the United States, which means that at least 95% of people living with HIV do not tr ansmit the virus to an yone else. This represents an 89% decline in the tr ansmission rate since the mid-1980s, reflecting the combined impact of testing, prev ention counseling, and treatment efforts targeted to those living with HIV infection (CDC, 2013). The estimated incidence of HIV has remained gener ally stable in recent y ears, at about 50,000 new HIV infections per y ear (CDC, 2014a). While this number is still too high, stabilization is in itself a sign of positiv e progress. With continued increases in the number of people living with HIV due to effectiv e HIV medications, there are potentially more opportunities for HIV tr ansmission than ev er before. Y et, the annual number of new infections has not increased (CDC, 2013). Worldwide, there were about 2.1 million new cases of HIV in 2013, and about 35 million people are living with HIV around the world. Of those, 3.2 million are children, 2.1 million are adolescents, and 4.2 million are people o ver age 50. In 2013 new HIV infections worldwide were 2.1 million, but new infections ha ve fallen 38% since 2001 and new infections among children ha ve fallen b y 58% in the same period (CDC, 2014b; UNAIDS , 2014b). Through 2011 the cumulativ e estimated number of deaths of people with diagnosed HIV infection ev er classified as stage 3 (AIDS) in the United States w as 648,000 (deaths ma y be due to an y cause, which can mak e data interpretation complex). Nearly 39 million people with AIDS ha ve died worldwide since the epidemic began (CDC, 2014b). Globally , AIDS-related deaths, which peak ed in 2005 at 2.4 million and ha ve declined steadily ev er since, were estimated at 1.5 million in 2013 (UNAIDS , 2014a). Ev en though Sub-Sahar an Africa bears the biggest burden of HIV/AIDS , countries in South and Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe and Centr al Asia, and those in Latin America are significantly affected b y HIV and AIDS (CDC, 2014b; UNAIDS , 2014b).In 2014 UNAIDS set forth the goal known as 90-90-90, which means that, b y 2020, 90% of people living with HIV will know their HIV status. 90% of those diagnosed with HIV infection will receiv e sustained antiretro viral therapy. 90% of all people receiving antiretro viral ther apy will ha ve viral suppression. (UNAIDS , 2018) Transmission and Infection Control Necessary Conditions for HIV Infection [If not otherwise identified, the material in this section is from CDC historical records.] HIV is a relativ ely fragile virus, which is not spread b y casual contact. HIV is not easy to \"catch\"\u2014it must be acquired . In order for HIV to be tr ansmitted, three conditions must occur: There must be an HIV source. There must be a sufficient dose of virus. There must be access to the bloodstream of another person. Body Fluids That Can Transmit HIV Anyone infected with the virus is potentially a source of HIV infection. T ransmission occurs primarily through infected blood, semen, v aginal secretions, or breast milk. S weat, tears, saliva, urine, and feces are not capable of tr ansmitting HIV unless visibly contaminated with blood. In settings such as hospital oper ating rooms, other fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleur al fluid, pericardial fluid, and amniotic fluid ma y be considered infectious if the source is HIV positiv e. These fluids are gener ally not found outside the hospital setting. Therefore, the most common body fluids considered potentially infectious for HIV are blood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk . Sufficient Dose The concentr ation and amount of HIV necessary for infection to occur is called a sufficient dose . BloodAccess to another person' s bloodstream in volves beha viors or circumstances that place someone at risk for infectious fluid entering their bloodstream. The most common of the risk beha viors are unprotected sexual intercourse (anal, vaginal, oral) with an infected person and use of contaminated equipment for injecting drugs . HIV tr ansmission ma y occur during pr actices such as tattooing, blood-sharing activities such as \"blood brother \" rituals, or an y other t ype of ritualistic ceremonies where blood is exchanged, or when unsteriliz ed equipment contaminated with blood is shared. HIV transmission ma y also occur in occupational settings, which will be discussed later in this section. Means and Requirements for HIV Transmission People ma y become infected with HIV if they engage in specific risk beha viors or if they are exposed through needlestick injuries (usually in a healthcare setting). Other blood contact with mucous membr anes or non-intact skin pro vides a possible, but not probable, chance of transmission. HIV is tr ansmitted through: Unprotected anal, v aginal, and or al intercourse Sharing needles or other injection equipment A mother passing the virus to her bab y either before or during birth An infected woman breastfeeding her infant Accidental needlestick injuries, or infected body fluid coming into contact with the broken skin or mucous membr anes of another person (as with healthcare work ers) A transfusion prior to 1986 of HIV -infected blood or blood products In extremely r are cases, HIV can be tr ansmitted b y sharing r azors or toothbrushes, if infected blood from one person w as deposited on the toothbrush or r azor and the blood entered the bloodstream of another person. The transmission of HIV depends upon: The availability of the infectious agent (HIV) in sufficient quantit y The viability of the infectious agent (how strong it is) The virulence of the infectious agent (how infectious it is) The ability of the infectious agent to reach the bloodstream, mucous membr anes, or broken skin of a potential host (the entry for getting into another person' s body)One of the predictors of the infectious lev el of an HIV -positiv e person is vir al load, which is how much HIV is present in the bloodstream. Studies show a clear connection between higher vir al load in the blood and increased tr ansmissibilit y of HIV . Answer: DTest Your Learning Conditions for the tr ansmission of HIV include: Blood Transfusions Transmission b y contaminated blood or blood products occurred in the United States before March 1985. T esting for HIV at blood banks and organ tr ansplant centers began in 1985 and has almost completely eliminated the risks for tr ansmission in dev eloped countries. In 1999 about 1% of national AIDS cases were caused b y transfusions or use of contaminated blood products. The majorit y of those cases were in people who receiv ed blood or blood products before 1985. Sexu al Intercourse HIV can enter the bloodstream through mucous membr anes\u2014breaks, sores, and cuts in the mouth, anus, v agina, or penis. Anal, v aginal, and or al intercourse (both receptiv e and penetr ative) can tr ansmit HIV from person to person. Anal Intercourse Unprotected anal intercourse is considered to be the greatest sexual risk for transmitting HIV . Anal intercourse frequently results in tears of mucous membr anes, which mak es it v ery easy for the virus to enter the bloodstream. The receptiv e partner is considered to be at more risk of getting HIV if the virus is present. Risks v ary for the insertiv e partner . Vaginal IntercourseDispersal of droplets from an infected person with a cough.A. Casual contact with an infected person.B. A genetic predisposition to HIV and a compromised immune system..C. Access to the bloodstream of another person, sufficient dose of virus, and an HIV source.D.Unprotected v aginal intercourse with the ex change of semen, pre-ejaculate fluid, menstrual blood, or v aginal fluid is also a risk for HIV tr ansmission. Studies ha ve shown that women are more lik ely to become infected with HIV through v aginal sex than men who ha ve sex with them. The larger amount of mucous membr ane surface area of the vagina is a probable reason for women' s greater r ate of HIV infection from their male partners. Sharing Needles a nd Drug Injection Equipment Sharing injection needles, syringes, and other drug par aphernalia with an HIV -infected person can put HIV directly into the user 's bloodstream and is the beha vior that most easily tr ansmits HIV , hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV). Indirect sharing occurs when drug users share injection par aphernalia or divide a shared or jointly purchased drug while preparing and injecting it. The par aphernalia that carry the potential for tr ansmission are the syringe, needle, \"cook er,\" cotton, and rinse w ater. Sharing these items (sometimes called \"works\") ma y transmit HIV , bacteria, and other viruses. Examples of indirect sharing are when a user squirts the drug back (from a dirt y syringe) into the drug cook er or someone else' s syringe or shares a common filter or rinse water. Probability of HIV Transmission from One HIV Exposure Donor screening, blood testing, and other processing measures ha ve reduced the risk of transfusion-caused HIV tr ansmission in the United States to between 1 in 450,000 and 1 in 600,000 tr ansfusions. Donating blood is alw ays safe in the United States, because sterile needles and equipment are used. All used syringes, needles, and blood or body fluid spills should be considered potentially infectious, and should be treated using Standard Precautions (formerly known as Univ ersal Precautions). Online Resource HIV Risk Behaviors http://www .cdc.go v/hiv/policies/la w/risk.html *A 1% risk means 1 chance in 100 for infection to occur. An 0.10% risk means 1 chance in 1,000. Source: CD C.Probability of Infection Following One Exposure to HIV* Source of infection HIV infection rate (%) Contaminated blood transfusion (prior to 1986) 95.0 One intravenous syringe or needle exposure 0.67 One percutaneous exposure (e.g . a needlestick) 0.4 One episode of receptive anal sexual intercourse 0.1-3 One episode of receptive vaginal intercourse 0.1-0.2 One episode of insertive vaginal intercourse 0.03-0.09 HIV and Pregnancy An HIV -infected woman ma y transmit the virus to her bab y during pregnancy , during the birth process, or following pregnancy b y breastfeeding. One of the predictors of how infectious the woman will be to her bab y is her vir al load (how much HIV is present in her bloodstream). W omen with new or recent infections or people in later stages of AIDS tend to have higher vir al loads and ma y be more infectious. In 1994 researchers disco vered that a course of the antiretro viral drug AZT (zido vudine) significantly reduced the tr ansmission of HIV from woman to bab y. In 2002 medications such as AZT and others were introduced during pregnancy and deliv ery to prev ent transmission of HIV . HIV is tr ansmitted from an HIV -infected woman to her bab y in about 25% of pregnancies if interv ention with antiretro viral medications does not occur . The perinatal tr ansmission r ate has dropped dr amatically in the United States due to the widespread use of AZT b y HIV - infected pregnant women. When a woman' s health is monitored closely and she receiv es a combination of antiretro viral ther apies during pregnancy , the risk of HIV tr ansmission to the newborn drops below 2%. In some pregnancies, cesarean section (C -section) ma y be recommended to reduce the risk of tr ansmission from woman to bab y. Advice about medications and C -section should be giv en on an individual basis b y a medical pro vider with experience in treating HIV - positiv e pregnant women. Video (2:57): HIV and Pregnancy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSlLvoKGJxE&t=44s Lifelo ng Infection HIV infection is lifelong\u2014once people become infected with HIV , their blood, semen, v aginal secretions, and breast milk will alw ays be potentially infectious. Transmission of Multidrug-Resist ant Forms of HIV There is evidence of tr ansmission of multidrug-resistant forms of HIV . People who ha ve been infected with HIV and ha ve used a number of the a vailable antiretro viral medicines may transmit forms of HIV that are resistant to some of these a vailable drug ther apies. This reduces the treatments a vailable for the newly HIV -infected person. Factors Affecting HIV Transmission The Presen ce of Other STDs The presence of other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) increases the risk for HIV transmission, because the infected person ma y have a much larger number of HIV -infected white blood cells present at the site of infection. The infected person' s immune system ma y be less able to suppress or combat HIV infection. Lesions from STDs break down the protectiv e surface of the skin or mucous membr ane, which mak es the infected person more vulner able to other infections. The presence of a co-infection with other STDs increases the risk of HIV tr ansmission because: HIV and Pr egnancy HIV and Pr egnancySTDs lik e syphilis and symptomatic herpes can cause breaks in the skin, which provide direct entry for HIV . Inflammation from STDs, such as chlam ydia, mak es it easier for HIV to enter and infect the body . HIV is often detected in the pus or other discharge from genital ulcers of HIV -infected men and women. Sores can bleed easily and come into contact with v aginal, cervical, or al, urethr al, and rectal tissues during sex. Inflammation appears to increase HIV vir al shedding and the vir al load in genital secretions. Multiple Partners Having multiple partners for drug injection or sexual intercourse increases the chances of being exposed to a person infected with HIV . People who ha ve unprotected sex with multiple partners are considered to be at high risk for HIV infection. In some studies, the CDC defines multiple partners as six or more partners in a y ear. Howev er, someone who has only one partner is still at risk if the person is HIV -positiv e and they ha ve unprotected sex and/or share needles. Use of Non-Injecting Drugs Use of other substances, including alcohol and non-injecting street drugs, can also put a person at risk for getting HIV . These substances impair judgment, increasing the lik elihood that a person will tak e risks (ha ve unprotected sex, share needles), or ma y place the person in unsafe situations. Additionally , some substances ha ve physiologic and biologic effects on the body , including masking pain and producing sores on the mouth and genitals, which can create additional \"openings\" for HIV and other sexually tr ansmitted diseases. Gender and Equality Issues Lack of power (being subservient) in a relationship can affect a person' s abilit y to insist on sexual protection, such as the use of condoms. W omen are socially and economically dependent upon men in man y societies. This sometimes results in their being unable to ask their partner to use condoms or to lea ve a relationship that puts them at risk. In some cultures, females are not encour aged to learn about their bodies, sex, birth control, or sexualit y topics, while some other cultures promote the v alue of the male having multiple sexual partners but discour age the same beha vior in females. Gender inequalit y places women at risk for contacting HIV .Casual Contact HIV is not tr ansmitted through the air or b y sneezing, breathing, or coughing. T ouching, hugging, and shaking hands do not tr ansmit HIV . HIV tr ansmission is not possible through restaur ant food prepared or serv ed by an HIV -infected emplo yee. HIV is not tr ansmitted through casual contact in the workplace. No cases of HIV transmission ha ve been link ed to sharing computers, food, telephones, paper , water fountains, swimming pools, bathrooms, desks, office furniture, toilet seats, showers, tools, equipment, coffee pots, or eating facilities. Howev er, personal items that ma y be contaminated with blood, including but not limited to r azors, toothbrushes, and sex to ys, should not be shared. There ha ve been no cases of HIV tr ansmission b y children pla ying, eating, sleeping, kissing, and hugging someone infected with HIV . Unusual Cases o f HIV Transmission To date, less than a doz en known cases of HIV tr ansmission ha ve occurred in household settings in the United States and elsewhere. R eports of these cases ha ve been thoroughly investigated b y the CDC. The researchers determined that the tr ansmissions were caused by sharing a r azor contaminated with infected blood, exposure of infected blood to cuts and brok en skin, and (possibly) deep kissing in volving a couple who both had bleeding gums and poor dental h ygiene. It is important to remember that these cases were extremely unusual. Sensible precautions with bleeding cuts and not sharing personal hygiene items could ha ve prev ented these cases of infection. There are also few isolated cases of tr ansmission from healthcare work ers to patients. T o date, there were three instances where tr ansmission of HIV could only be tr acked to the HIV-infected clinician treating the patient. A t least one of these cases occurred prior to the implementation of strict equipment disinfection. Biting Biting poses v ery little risk of HIV tr ansmission. The possibilit y only exists if the person who is biting and the person who is bitten ha ve an ex change of blood such as through bleeding gums or open sores in the mouth. Bites ma y transmit other infections, and should be treated immediately b y thoroughly w ashing the bitten skin with soap and w arm w ater and then disinfecting and proph ylaxis with antibiotic skin ointment. Workplace Sit uations Workplace exposures gener ally occur through a needlestick injury but can occur through a splash of infectious blood or exposure to blood-contaminated material. (Occupational exposure is discussed later in the course.)Answer: CTest Your Learning The behavior associated with the highest risk of HIV transmission is: Apply Your Learning Q: A client wants to know what behaviors will increase his risk of HIV. What would you teach him? A: Your risk of exposure to HIV increases by risky behaviors such as having multiple sexual partners, unprotected anal and vaginal intercourse, and exposure to any used and infected IV needles and drug paraphernalia. Risk Reduction Methods There are many effective methods for reducing the risk of sexual and drug-related transmission of HIV. Sexual Abstinence Sexual abstinence (not engaging in anal, vaginal, or oral intercourse or other sexual activities where blood, semen, or vaginal fluid can enter the body) is a completely safe and 100% effective method for preventing the sexual transmission of HIV. Non-Penetrative Sex Non-penetrative sex, where the penis does not enter the vagina, anus, or mouth, and when penetrative sex toys are not shared, is a safer sex method that greatly decreases your risk of getting infected with HIV. This practice will not transmit HIV, provided that there is no exchange of blood, semen, vaginal fluids, or breast milk in the sexual contact. Non-penetrative sexual intercourse, however, may still be a risk factor for the transmission of other sexually transmitted diseases. Monogamous Long-Term RelationshipsUnprotected vaginal intercourse.A. Breastfeeding.B. Unprotected anal intercourse.C. Direct sharing of drug paraphernalia.D.Monogamy \u2014having sex with only one person who only has sex with y ou\u2014is another choice to prev ent/reduce the risk of HIV infection. If neither partner is infected with HIV or other STDs, and neither has other sexual or injection equipment -sharing contacts, then neither partner is at risk of exposure to HIV or other STDs. In order for monogam y to protect against HIV and STDs, both partners must be free of disease and both partners must remain monogamous. Limiting Partners The decision to limit the number of sexual or drug-injecting partners ma y reduce the risk of HIV tr ansmission but is not a guar antee of safet y. The fewer the partners the greater the reduction of risk. If howev er, even one of the partners has HIV , the risk of tr ansmission increases. Safer Sexua l Practices Did you know . . . Not all condoms and lubricants pro vide effectiv e protection against the transmission of HIV and other STDs. Latex Condoms When used correctly and consistently during sexual intercourse (anal, v aginal, and or al), latex condoms are highly effectiv e in prev enting the tr ansmission of HIV . To prev ent tearing of latex condoms, only w ater-based lubricants should be used. Oil-based lubricants lik e petroleum jelly or cooking oils should not be used because the oil in these products breaks down the latex condom. Polyurethane Condoms For the male, polyurethane condoms are made of a soft plastic. They look lik e latex condoms but are thinner . Lab tests show that sperm and viruses (lik e HIV) cannot pass through polyurethane. Female condoms are insertiv e (fit inside the v agina or anus). They are made of polyurethane, which blocks sperm and viruses (lik e HIV). These condoms ma y be inserted several hours before intercourse. If howev er, there is still blood/semen contact with a cut on the outside of the v agina, this ma y still serv e as a point of entry for the HIV ev en if the female condom is used. Dental DamsDental dams\u2014large pieces of new , unused, clear , non-microw aveable plastic wr ap\u2014and latex condoms ma y be used to pro vide a barrier to reduce the risk of HIV tr ansmission during or al intercourse. The latex condom can be cut into a square for use as a dental dam. W ater-based lubricants ma y be used with the dental dams, plastic wr ap, or cut -open condoms to enhance sensitivit y and reduce friction. Natural Membrane Condoms Did you know . . . Natur al membr ane condoms (skins) do not pro vide protection from HIV, HBV , and some other STDs. They can, howev er, help prev ent pregnancies and some STDs, such as syphilis. When Both Partners Are HIV Positive If two people are infected with HIV , do they still need to ha ve protected sex? Some people think it is safe for HIV -infected people to ha ve unprotected sex with each other , but latex condoms are advised when both partners are HIV positiv e. Each additional exposure to the virus ma y further weak en an immune system already damaged b y HIV . Variations and mutations of the HIV ma y create additional infection from other str ains of the HIV with unprotected sex. Other STDs are tr ansmitted through unprotected sex. An y additional vir al or bacterial infection stresses the immune system and should be a voided. Avoidance of Injection Drug Use Not injecting drugs is another w ay to a void tr ansmission of HIV . If a person refuses to abstain from injecting drugs, then they should use a clean needle each time and not share injection equipment. This includes people who use needles to inject insulin, vitamins, steroids, or prescription and non-prescription drugs. Syringe Exchange Syringe and needle ex change is a disease-prev ention progr am for people who use illegal drugs. It pro vides new sterile syringes in ex change for used ones. P eople who tr ade in their used syringes/needles for clean ones at needle ex changes significantly reduce their risk for becoming infected with HIV or hepatitis through sharing infected needles. Syringe ex changes are also referr al sources for drug treatment. P articipants ma y be able to secure drug treatment through the interv ention of the syringe ex change staff . Public support for syringe ex change has grown in recent y ears.It is safest alw ays to use new , sterile needles and syringes, as well as other \"works, \" which can all become contaminated with blood. If someone cannot a void sharing syringes, rinsing out the syringe/needle with full-strength bleach and clean w ater helps clean the syringe/needle and kill an y HIV inside it. There is high prev alence of HBV and HCV infection among injecting drug users; these viruses are stronger than HIV and are not lik ely to be killed b y short contact with bleach. Cleaning the syringe with bleach and w ater is not lik ely to prev ent tr ansmission of HBV or HCV. There is no substitute for a new syringe. If there is no possible w ay to obtain new needles, the directions for using bleach to clean syringes/needles are: It is important to follow these steps exactly , because inadequate cleaning can result in the possibilit y of HIV infection. Alw ays do the final rinse with w ater! Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Occupational exposure means reasonably anticipated skin, ey e, mucous membr ane, or parenter al contact with blood or other potentially infected materials (OPIM) that ma y result from the performance of an emplo yee's duties. Exposure incident means a specific ey e, mouth, other mucous membr ane, non-intact skin, or parenter al contact with blood or OPIM that results from the performance of an emplo yee's duties. Examples of non-intact skin at risk include skin with dermatitis, hangnails, cuts, abr asions, chafing, or acne. Occupational groups that ha ve been widely recogniz ed as ha ving potential exposure to HBV/HCV/HIV include, but are not limited to , healthcare emplo yees, la w enforcement, fire, ambulance, and other emergency response, and public service emplo yees.Fill the syringe completely with w ater. 1. Tap it with y our finger to loosen an y traces of blood. 2. Shake the syringe and shoot out the bloody w ater. 3. Repeat these steps until y ou can' t see any blood. Then: 4. Fill the syringe completely with fresh bleach. 5. Keep the bleach inside the syringe for at least 30 seconds. 6. Shoot out the used bleach.7. Rinse out the syringe with new , clean water. 8. Shake the syringe and squirt out the water. 9.The compliance directiv e of the feder al Occupational Safet y and Health Administr ation (OSHA) on occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, CPL 2-2.69, ma y be consulted for guidance. F or more information or assistance, contact a Department of Labor and Industries (L&I) consultant in y our area. Check the blue go vernment section of the phone book for the office nearest y ou. Answer: DTest Your Learning Occupational exposure means: Apply Your Knowledge Q: Healthcare professionals need to receiv e bloodborne pathogens tr aining. What would it include? A: Training includes protectiv e measures to minimiz e the risk and what to do if exposure occurs. Bloodborne Pathogens While HBV and HIV are specifically identified in the standard, bloodborne pathogens include any human pathogen present in human blood or OPIM . Bloodborne pathogens ma y V-II, and vir al hemorrhagic fev er. According to the CDC, hepatitis C (HCV) infection is the most common chronic bloodborne infection in the United States. Hepatitis C is a vir al infection of the liv er transmitted primarily b y exposure to blood. Blood and OPIMExposure to food serv ed by an HIV -infected emplo yee. A. Being infected b y an occupational work er. B. Caring for a patient who has HIV . C. Reasonably anticipated skin, ey e, mucous membr ane, or parenter al contact with blood or OPIM that ma y result from the performance of an emplo yee's duties.D.Bodily fluids that ha ve been recogniz ed and link ed to the tr ansmission of HIV , HBV , and HCV, and to which Standard Precautions apply , are: Blood Blood products Semen Vaginal secretions Cerebrospinal fluid Synovial (joint) fluid Pleural (lung) fluid Peritoneal (gut) fluid Pericardial (heart) fluid Amniotic (fluid surrounding the fetus) fluid Saliva in dental procedures Specimens with concentr ated HIV , HBV and HCV viruses Body fluids such as urine, feces, and v omitus are not considered OPIM unless visibly contaminated b y blood. W astew ater (sew age) has not been implicated in the tr ansmission of HIV , HBV , and HCV and is not considered to be either OPIM or regulated w aste. Howev er, plumbers working in healthcare facilities or who are exposed to sew age originating directly from healthcare facilities carry a theoretical risk of occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Emplo yers should consider this risk when preparing their written \"exposure determination. \" Plumbers or w astew ater work ers working elsewhere are probably not at risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. W astew ater contains man y other health hazards and work ers should use appropriate personal protectiv e equipment (PPE) and maintain personal h ygiene standards when working. Exposure Control Plan (ECP) If exposures to blood or other body fluids are reasonably anticipated, y ou are required b y the Occupational Safet y and Health Administr ation (OSHA) Bloodborne P athogens Standard to dev elop an Exposure Control Plan.An Exposure Control Plan is designed to protect staff who ma y be exposed to blood and other body fluids. By protecting staff , you also control exposure incident costs. Such a plan is meant to be a \"living\" document \u2014a source for answering bloodborne pathogen-related questions and an assur ance that exposure control activities are in place. Be sure y our facilit y's Exposure Control Plan meets OSHA 's criteria. According to the OSHA Bloodborne P athogens Standard, an Exposure Control Plan must meet certain criteria: It must be written specifically for each facilit y. It must be reviewed and updated at least y early (to reflect changes such as new worker positions or technology used to reduce exposures to blood or body fluids). It must be readily a vailable to all work ers. You must regularly educate y our work ers on the uses of the Exposure Control Plan and where it 's kept, so it is a vailable when needed. OSHA dev eloped a model template, the Model Plans and Progr ams for the OSHA Bloodborne P athogens and Hazard Communications Standards, which includes a guide for creating an Exposure Control Plan that meets the requirements of the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard. Bloodborne Pathogens Training Training will include information on the hazards associated with blood/OPIM, the protectiv e measures to be tak en to minimiz e the risk of occupational exposure, and information on the appropriate actions to tak e if an exposure occurs. R etraining is required annually , or when changes in procedures or tasks affecting occupational exposure occur . Emplo yees must be pro vided access to a qualified tr ainer during the tr aining session to ask and ha ve answered questions as questions arise. Hepatitis B Va ccination All emplo yees with occupational exposure to blood or OPIM must be offered hepatitis B vaccination after receiving required tr aining and within 10 da ys of initial assignment. The vaccine must be pro vided free of charge. Serologic testing after v accination (to ensure that the shots were effectiv e) is recommended for all people with ongoing exposure to sharp medical devices. Infection Control SystemsUniversal Precautions w as a system designed to prev ent tr ansmission of bloodborne pathogens in healthcare and other settings. Under Univ ersal Precautions, blood/OPIM of all patients should alw ays be considered potentially infectious for HIV and other pathogens. Standard Precautions is the preferred, newer system because it considers all body fluids ex cept sweat to be potentially infectious. Standard Precautions and Univ ersal Precautions in volve the use of protectiv e barriers to reduce the risk of exposure of the emplo yee's skin or mucous membr anes to OPIM. It is also recommended that all healthcare work ers tak e precautions to prev ent injuries caused by needles, scalpels, and other sharp instruments or devices. Both Standard and Univ ersal Precautions apply to blood and OPIM. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) Gloves, masks, protectiv e eyewear and chin-length plastic face shields are examples of personal protectiv e equipment (PPE). PPE shall be pro vided and worn b y emplo yees in all instances where they will or ma y come into contact with blood or OPIM. This includes but is not limited to dentistry , phlebotom y, or processing of an y bodily fluid specimen, and postmortem (after death) procedures. Traditionally , latex glo ves ha ve been advised for use when dealing with blood or OPIM. Howev er, some people are allergic to latex. In most circumstances, nitrile, vin yl, and other glove alternativ es meet the definition of \"appropriate\" glo ves and ma y be used instead of latex glo ves. Emplo yers are required to pro vide non-latex alternativ es to emplo yees with latex and other sensitivities. R eusable PPE must be cleaned and decontaminated or laundered b y the emplo yer. Lab coats and scrubs are gener ally considered to be worn as uniforms or personal clothing. When contamination is reasonably lik ely, protectiv e gowns should be worn. If lab coats or scrubs are worn as PPE, they must be remo ved as soon as pr actical and laundered b y the emplo yer. Safer Medical Dev ices Safe medical devices and work pr actices are prefer able to personal protectiv e equipment to minimiz e or eliminate emplo yee exposure. There are now man y safer medical devices available.Emplo yers must include emplo yees in ongoing ev aluation of safer medical devices and implement these devices whenev er feasible. Ev aluation and implementation of these devices must be documented in the en vironmental safet y manual. Safer medical device lists can be accessed through websites maintained b y the California Division of Occupational Safet y and Health SHARP progr am, the National Association for the Primary Prevention of Sharps Injuries, and the International Health Care W orker Safet y Center . Hand Hygiene Hand h ygiene is the first k ey beha vior to minimiz e risk of contact with potentially infected blood. Soap- and-water w ashing or use of a w aterless alcohol-based hand rub must be performed: After remo val of glo ves or other protectiv e equipment Immediately after hand contact with blood or other infectious materials Upon lea ving the work area It is also strongly recommended that hand h ygiene be performed before and after patient contact and after using restroom facilities. Soap- and-water hand w ashing must be performed whenev er hands are visibly contaminated or there is a reasonable lik elihood of contamination. Proper soap- and-water hand w ashing technique in volves the following: Using soap , warm (almost hot) w ater, and good friction, scrub the top , back, and all sides of the fingers. Lather well and rinse for at least 10 seconds. When rinsing, begin at the fingertips, so that the dirt y water runs down and off the hands from the wrists. It is prefer able to use a pump-t ype of liquid soap instead of bar hand soap . Dry hands on paper towels. Use the dry paper towels to turn off the faucets (don' t touch with clean hands). It is advisable to k eep fingernails short, and to wear a minimum of jewelry . Answer: AApply Your Knowledge Adherence to hand h ygiene has been measured at r ates as low as 5% in some healthcare settings. How does y our workplace measure up? A t your next staff meeting, see how many of y our cowork ers can correctly identif y the three steps of hand h ygiene listed above. Test Your Learning Hand h ygiene: Housekeeping The work area is to be maintained in a clean and sanitary condition. The emplo yer is required to determine and implement a written schedule for cleaning and disinfection based on the location within the facilit y, type of surface to be cleaned, t ype of soil present and tasks or procedures being performed. All equipment and en vironmental and working surfaces must be properly cleaned and disinfected after contact with blood or OPIM. Brok en glassw are that is contaminated must be remo ved using mechanical means, lik e a brush and dustpan or v acuum cleaner . Disin fectants Chemical germicides and disinfectants used at recommended dilutions must be used to decontaminate en vironmental surfaces. Consult the En vironmental Protection Agency (EP A) lists of registered sterilants, tuberculocidal disinfectants, and antimicrobials with HIV/HBV efficacy claims for v erification that the disinfectant used is appropriate. Specim en Handling Specimens of blood or OPIM must be placed in a closeable, labeled or color -coded, leakproof container prior to being stored or tr ansported. LaundryIs required after remo val of glo ves or other PPEs and upon lea ving the work area.A. Is not required after remo ving glo ves. B. Is required only after contact with blood or other infectious materials.C. Includes the use of lotion to prev ent dry skin. D.Disposal ContainerLaundry that is or may be soiled with blood or OPIM, or may contain contaminated sharps, must be treated as though contaminated. Contaminated laundry must be bagged at the location where it was used, and shall not be sorted or rinsed in patient-care areas. It must be placed and transported in bags that are labeled or color-coded (red-bagged). Laundry workers must wear protective gloves and other appropriate personal protective clothing when handling potentially contaminated laundry. All contaminated laundry must be cleaned or laundered so that any infectious agents are destroyed. Guidance regarding laundry handling and washing procedures in the healthcare setting can be found in the CDC Guideline Disinfection and Sterilization in Health-Care Facilities, 2008 (CDC, 2008; latest available). Regulated Waste Disposal All regulated waste must be placed in closeable, leakproof containers or bags that are color-coded (red-bagged) or labeled to prevent leakage during handling, storage, and transport. Disposal of waste shall be in accordance with federal, state, and local regulations. Individual county or health jurisdiction waste management regulations may need to be consulted. Apply Your Knowledge Q: A co-worker asks you how to dispose of regulated waste. How would you explain the process? A: Regulated waste is suspicious of body fluids and may not be flushed down toilets and must be placed in closeable leakproof containers or bags, and color -coded or labeled. This includes items on which blood has dried. Sharps DisposalSource: Co urtesy of Joe Mabel, photographer, Wikimedia Commons.Needles are not to be recapped , purposely bent or brok en, remo ved, or otherwise manipulated b y hand. After they are used, disposable syringes and needles, scalpel blades, and other sharp items are to be immediately placed in puncture-resistant, labeled containers for disposal. Phlebotom y needles must not be remo ved from holders unless required by a medical procedure. The intact phlebotom y needle/holder must be placed directly into an appropriate sharps container . Tags/Labels Tags or labels identif ying medical equipment, chemicals or medications must be used to protect emplo yees from exposure to potentially hazardous biological agents. All required tags must ha ve the following: Tags must contain a signal word or symbol and a major message. The signal word shall be BIOHAZARD , or the biological hazard symbol. The major message must indicate the specific hazardous condition or the instruction to be communicated to the emplo yee. The signal word must be readable at a minimum of fiv e feet or such greater distance as warranted b y the hazard. The tag' s major message must be presented in either pictogr aphs, written text, or both. The signal word and the major message must be understandable to all emplo yees who ma y be exposed to the identified hazard. All emplo yees will be informed as to the meaning of the v arious tags used throughout the workplace and what special precautions are necessary . Personal Activities Eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, and handling contact lenses are prohibited in work areas that carry occupational exposure. F ood and drink must not be stored in refriger ators, freez ers, or cabinets where blood or OPIM are stored, or in other areas. Post Exposure ManagementEmplo yers must mak e a confidential post exposure medical ev aluation a vailable to emplo yees who report an exposure incident. The emplo yer is also responsible for arr anging individual testing in accordance with the la w and state statutes. The post exposure medical ev aluation must be: Made immediately a vailable to the emplo yee Kept confidential Provided at no cost to the emplo yee Provided according to current U .S. Public Health Service recommendations Occupational Exposure to HIV/HBV/HCV and Other Bloodborne Pathogens An occupational exposure to a bloodborne pathogen is defined as a percutaneous injury such as a needle stick or cut with a sharp object, or contact of mucous membr ane or non- intact skin (eg, exposed skin that is chapped, abr aded, or afflicted with dermatitis) with blood, tissue, or OPIM. The CDC states that the risk of infection v aries case b y case. F actors influencing the risk of infection include: Whether the exposure w as from a hollow -bore needle or other sharp instrument Non-intact skin or mucus membr anes (such as the ey es, nose, and/or mouth) The amount of blood that w as involved The amount of virus present in the source' s blood Risk of HIV Transmission The risk of HIV infection to a healthcare work er through a needlestick is less than 1%. Appro ximately 1 in 300 exposures through a needle or sharp instrument result in infection. The risks of HIV infection though splashes of blood to the ey es, nose, or mouth is ev en smaller \u2014appro ximately 1 in 1,000. There ha ve been no reports of HIV tr ansmission from blood contact with intact skin. There is a theoretical risk of blood contact to an area of skin that is damaged, or from a large area of skin co vered in blood for a long period of time. The CDC reports that \"as of 2010, 57 documented tr ansmissions and 143 possible transmissions had been reported in the United States, \" and \"no confirmed cases of occupational HIV tr ansmission ha ve been reported since 1999\" (CDC, 2016). Risk of Hep atitis B a nd C TransmissionThe risk of getting HBV from a needlestick is 22% to 31% if the source person tests positiv e for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg). If the source person is HBsAg-positiv e and HBeAg-negativ e there is a 1% to 6% risk of getting HBV unless the person exposed has been v accinated. The risk of getting HCV from a needlestick is 1.8%. The risk of getting HBV or HCV from a blood splash to the ey es, nose, or mouth is possible but believ ed to be v ery small. As of 1999, about 800 healthcare work ers a y ear are reported to be infected with HBV following occupational exposure. There are no exact estimates on how man y healthcare work ers contract HCV from an occupational exposure, but the risk is considered low . Treatment After a Potential Exposure Follow the protocol of y our emplo yer. As soon as safely possible, w ash the affected area(s) with soap and w ater. Application of antiseptics should not be a substitute for w ashing. It is recommended that an y potentially contaminated clothing be remo ved as soon as possible. It is also recommended that y ou familiariz e yourself with existing protocols and the location of emergency ey ewash or showers and other stations within y our facilit y. Mucous Membrane Exposure If there is exposure to the ey es, nose, or mouth, flush thoroughly with w ater, saline, or sterile irrigants. The risk of contr acting HIV through this t ype of exposure is estimated to be 0.09%. Sharps Injuries Wash the exposed area with soap and w ater. Do not \"milk\" or squeez e the wound. There is no evidence that shows using antiseptics (lik e hydrogen pero xide) will reduce the risk of transmission for an y bloodborne pathogens, howev er, the use of antiseptics is not contraindicated. In the ev ent that the wound needs suturing, emergency treatment should be obtained. The risk of contr acting HIV from this t ype of exposure is estimated 0.3%. Bite or Scratch Wounds Exposure to saliv a is not considered substantial unless there is visible contamination with blood from a dental procedure. W ash the area with soap and w ater, and co ver with a sterile dressing as appropriate. All bites should be ev aluated b y a healthcare professional. Did you know . . . For human bites, the clinical ev aluation must include the possibilit y that both the person bitten and the person who inflicted the bite were exposed to bloodborne pathogens.Exposure to Urine, Vomitus, or Feces Exposure to urine, feces, v omitus, or sputum is not considered a potential bloodborne pathogen exposure, unless the fluid is visibly contaminated with blood. F ollow y our emplo yer's procedures for cleaning these fluids. Reporting the Exposure Follow the protocol of y our emplo yer. After cleaning the exposed area as recommended above, report the exposure to the department or individual at y our workplace that is responsible for managing exposure. Obtain medical ev aluation as soon as possible. Discuss with a healthcare professional the extent of the exposure, treatment, follow -up care, personal prev ention measures, the need for a tetanus shot or other care. Your emplo yer is required to report the occurrence and pro vide an appropriate post exposure management referr al at no cost to y ou. In addition, y our emplo yer must pro vide the following information to the ev aluating health care professional: A description of the job duties the exposed emplo yee was performing when exposed Documentation of the routes of exposure and circumstances under which exposure occurred Results of the source person' s blood testing, if a vailable All medical records that y ou are responsible to maintain, including v accination status, relevant to the appropriate treatment of the emplo yee Post Exposure Prophylaxis Post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) provides anti-HIV medications to someone who has had a substantial exposure, usually to blood. PEP has been the standard of care for occupationally exposed healthcare work ers with substantial exposures since 1996. Animal models suggest that cellular HIV infection happens within 2 da ys of exposure to HIV and the virus in blood is detectable within 5 da ys. Therefore, PEP should be started as soon as possible, within hours not da ys, after exposure and continued for 28 da ys. Howev er, PEP for HIV does not pro vide prev ention of other bloodborne diseases lik e HBV or HCV . Hepatitis B PEP for susceptible people would include administr ation of hepatitis B immune globulin and HBV v accine. This should occur as soon as possible and no later than 7 da ys post exposure.The benefit of the use of antivir al agents to prev ent HCV infection is unknown and antivir als are not currently FDA -appro ved for proph ylaxis. P ost exposure proph ylaxis can only be obtained from a licensed healthcare pro vider. Your facilit y may have recommendations and a chain of command in place for y ou to obtain PEP . After ev aluation of the exposure route and other risk factors, certain anti-HIV medications ma y be prescribed. The national bloodborne pathogen hotline pro vides 24-hour consultation for clinicians who ha ve been exposed on the job . PEP is not as simple as sw allowing one pill. The medications must be started as soon as possible and continued for 28 da ys. Man y people experience significant medication side effects. It is v ery important to report occupational exposure to the department at y our workplace that is responsible for managing exposure. If post exposure treatment is recommended, it should be started as soon as possible. In rur al areas, police, firefighters, and other at -risk emergency pro viders should identif y a 24-hour source for PEP (thebody .com, 2017). In addition, in man y states, health care and civil work ers ha ve a right to file a work ers' compensation claim for exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Industrial insur ance co vers the cost of post exposure proph ylaxis and follow -up for the injured work er. Apply Your Knowledge Q: A fellow health care work er has just had a needle stick and the source w as HIV positiv e. She panics and asks y ou what to do . What are resources to help her? A: After immediately cleaning the affected area with soap and w ater and a disinfectant, you would direct her to her supervisor and facilit y director o ver occupational health, y ou would direct her to get PEP . She can also mak e a work er's compensation claim for the PEP. She will need to tak e it for at least 28 da ys. You would tell her the National Hotline for PEP is also a resource. PEP should begin immediately , prefer ably within hours of exposure. Health care professionals and Pro viders can call 888-448-4911 for the latest information on PEP for HIV , hepatitis, and other pathogens. HIV/HBV/ HCV Testing Post ExposureAll occupational exposures should be ev aluated b y a healthcare professional. Ev aluation should include follow -up counseling, post exposure testing, and medical ev aluation regardless of whether PEP is indicated. Antibody testing for HIV , HBV , and HCV should be conducted for 6 months after occupational exposure. After baseline testing at the time of exposure, follow -up testing is recommended to be performed at 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months after exposure. Extended HIV follow -up for 12 months is recommended for those who become infected with HCV after exposure to a source co-infected with HIV . Extended follow -up in other circumstances for those people with an impaired abilit y to mount an antibody response to infection ma y also be considered. Source Testing Many states require the emplo yer to arr ange to test the source individual\u2014someone whose blood or OPIM an emplo yee was exposed to\u2014for HIV , HBV , and HCV as soon as feasible after getting their consent. If the emplo yer does not get consent the emplo yer must document such and inform the emplo yee. Mandatory Source Testing Because of an increased risk for HIV exposure, man y state codes pro vide for HIV antibody testing of a \"source\" when a la w enforcement officer , firefighter , healthcare pro vider, or healthcare facilit y staff , and certain other professions experience an occupational exposure. If you experience an occupational exposure to another person' s blood or OPIM, y ou can request HIV testing of the source individual through y our emplo yer or local health officer . Before health officers issue an order for HIV testing of the source individual, they will first determine whether a substantial exposure occurred and if the exposure occurred on the job. Depending on the t ype of exposure and risks in volved, the health officer ma y mak e the determination that source testing is unnecessary . In the case of occupationally exposed healthcare work ers, if the emplo yer is unable to obtain permission of the source individual, the emplo yer ma y request assistance from the local health officer if the request is made within 7 da ys of the occurrence. Source testing does not eliminate the need for baseline testing of the exposed individual for HIV , HBV , HCV , and liv er enzymes. Pro vision of PEP should also not be contingent upon the results of a source' s test. Current wisdom indicates immediate pro vision of PEP in certain circumstances, with discontinuation of treatment based upon the source' s test results. Answer: BTest Your Learning HIV tr ansmission risk to healthcare work ers is: Non-Occupational Exposure to HIV Post exposure proph ylaxis (PEP) for occupational exposure is standard, and its effectiv eness has been well documented. F or sexual exposure (assault or consensual) or for needle-sharing, PEP is not standard medical pr actice in man y communities. Depending on your location, pro viders ma y not ev en be familiar with the idea of pro viding PEP to people who ha ve post -sexual exposure to HIV . A good place to start PEP is y our local emergency department. P ost exposure proph ylaxis should nev er be used for primary prevention of HIV . Unlik e emergency contr aception to prev ent pregnancy , there are no good studies to show that PEP works for post -sexual exposure. It is a complicated combination of medicines that sometimes ha ve serious and uncomfortable side effects. Procedures for Homes and Home-like Settings People who liv e or work in homes and home-lik e settings should pr actice good h ygiene techniques in preparing food, handling body fluids, and using medical equipment. Cuts, accidents, or other circumstances can result in spills of blood/OPIM. These spills ma y be deposited upon carpeting, vin yl flooring, clothing, a person' s skin, or other surfaces. It is important that ev eryone, ev en young children, ha ve a basic understanding that they should not put their bare hands in, or on, another person' s blood. Safe pr actices for some commonly encountered situations can help minimiz e the risk of HIV exposure and infection. Gloves Gloves are a vailable in latex, nitrile, or vin yl. Some people ha ve allergies to latex. Gloves should be worn when caretak ers anticipate direct contact with an y body substances (blood or OPIM) or non-intact skin. When y ou are through, carefully pull the glo ves off , inside-out, one at a time, so that the contaminated surfaces are inside and y ou avoid contact with an y potentiallyHighest with a blood splash to the ey es, nose, or mouth. A. Less than 1% from a needlestick.B. Exactly the same as that of HCV . C. Not affected b y the amount of virus present in the exposure. D.infectious material. Gloves should be changed and hands w ashed as soon as possible between children, patients, and others. Never rub the ey es, mouth or face while wearing glo ves. Latex glo ves should nev er be washed and reused. Handwashing Technique Just as with occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens, hand h ygiene (see abo ve) is the first k ey beha vior to minimiz e risk of contact with potentially infected blood. Precautions with Personal Hygiene Items People should not share r azors, toothbrushes, personal towels or w ashcloths, dental hygiene tools, vibr ators, enema equipment, or other personal care items. Cleaning Blood/OPIM Wear appropriate glo ves. Use sterile gauz e or other bandages, and follow normal first -aid techniques to stop the bleeding. After applying the bandage, remo ve the glo ves slowly , so that fluid particles do not splatter or become aerosoliz ed. Hands should be w ashed using good technique as soon as possible. Cleaning Body Fluid Spills o n Vinyl Floors Any brok en glass should be swept up using a broom and dustpan (nev er bare hands!). Empty the dustpan in a well-mark ed plastic bag or hea vy-duty container . The body fluid spill ma y be pretreated with full-strength liquid disinfectant or detergent. Next, wipe up the body fluid spill with either a mop and hot soap y water or appropriate glo ves and paper towels. Dispose of the paper towels in the plastic bag. Use a good disinfectant such as household bleach 5.25% mix ed fresh with w ater 1:10 to disinfect the area that the spill occurred. If a mop w as used for the cleaning, soak it in a buck et of hot w ater and disinfectant for the recommended time. Empt y the mop buck et water in the toilet, r ather than a sink. Sponges and mops used to clean up body fluid spills should not be rinsed out in the kitchen sink, or in a location where food is prepared. Cleaning Body Fluid Spills o n CarpetingPour dry cat litter or other absorbent material on the spill to absorb the body fluid. Then pour full-strength liquid detergent on the carpet, which helps to disinfect the area. If there are pieces of brok en glass present, the broom- and-dustpan method can be used next to sweep up the kitt y litter and visible brok en glass. Use carpet -safe liquid disinfectant instead of diluted bleach on the carpeting. P our this carefully on the entire contaminated area; let it remain there for the time recommended b y the manufacturer . Follow this b y absorbing the spill with paper towels and sturdy rubber glo ves. Vacuum normally afterw ards. Any debris, paper towels, or soiled kitt y litter should be disposed of in a sealed plastic bag that has been placed inside another plastic garbage bag. T wist and seal the top of the second bag as well. Cleaning Laundry in Home Set tings Clothes, w ashable uniforms, towels, or other laundry that ha ve been stained with blood/OPIM should be cleaned and disinfected before further use. If possible, ha ve the person remo ve the clothing, or use appropriate glo ves to assist with remo ving the clothes. If it is a distance to the w ashing machine, tr ansport the soiled clothing items in a sturdy plastic bag. Next, place the items in the w ashing machine, and soak or w ash the items in cold, soap y water to remo ve any blood from the fabric. Hot w ater permanently sets blood stains. Use hot soap y water for the next w ashing cy cle, and include sufficient detergent, which will act as a disinfectant, in the w ater. Dry the items using a clothes dry er. Wool clothing or uniforms ma y be rinsed with cold soap y water and then dry cleaned to remo ve and disinfect the stain. Apply Your Knowledge Q: A family member of an HIV positiv e patient asks y ou how to a void an y infectious HIV when doing the laundry . How would y ou advise her on home clothing care? A: When caring for an HIV -infected person at home, clothes or towels that are contaminated with blood or OPIM should be cleaned and disinfected before further use. If there is no blood contamination on clothing, the clothes can be laundered lik e any other clothing. Diaper ChangesCare pro viders should use a new pair of appropriate glo ves to change diapers. Glo ves should be remo ved carefully and discarded in the appropriate receptacle. Hands should be washed immediately after changing the diaper . Disinfect the diapering surface afterw ards. Cloth diapers should be w ashed in v ery hot w ater with detergent and a cup of bleach, and dried in a hot clothes dry er. Cleaning Sponges and Mops Sponges and mops that are used in a kitchen should not be used to clean body fluid spills or bathrooms. All sponges and mops should be disinfected routinely with a fresh bleach solution or another similar disinfectant. Toilet/Bedpan Safety It is safe to share toilets/toilet seats without special cleaning, unless the surface becomes contaminated with blood/OPIM. If this occurs, disinfect the surface b y spraying on a solution of 1:10 bleach. W earing glo ves, wipe this a way with disposable paper towels. People with open sores on their legs, thighs, or genitals should disinfect the toilet seat after each use. Urinals and bedpans should not be shared between family members unless they are thoroughly disinfected beforehand. Thermometers Electronic thermometers with disposable co vers do not need to be cleaned between users, unless they are visibly soiled. Wipe the surface with a disinfectant solution if necessary . Glass thermometers should be w ashed with soap and w arm w ater before and after each use. If it will be shared between family members, the thermometer should be soak ed in 70%-90% eth yl alcohol for 30 minutes, then rinsed under a stream of w arm w ater between each use. Pet Care Precautions Certain animals ma y be health hazards for people with compromised immune systems. These animals include turtles, reptiles, birds, puppies and kittens under the age of 8 months, wild animals, pets without current immunizations, and pets with illnesses of unknown origin. Did you know . . . HIV cannot be spread to , from, or b y cats, dogs, birds, or other pets.Pet cages and cat litter bo xes can harbor infectious, and often aerosoliz ed organisms. These pet items should be cared for only b y someone who is not immunocompromised. If this is not possible, a mask with a sealable nose clip , and disposable latex glo ves should be worn each time pet care is done. F ollow all pet care with thorough handw ashing. Animals ma y carry a v ariety of diseases harmful to people with weak ened immune systems. Some of these diseases ma y be passed b y the animal licking their person' s face or open wounds. W ash hands after petting or other contact with pets. K eep cats' and dogs' nails trimmed. W ear latex glo ves to clean up a pet 's urine, feces, or v omitus. The soiled area should be cleaned with a fresh solution of 1:10 bleach. Pet food and w ater bowls should be regularly w ashed in w arm, soap y water, and then rinsed. Cat litter bo xes should be emptied out regularly and w ashed at least monthly . Fish tanks should be k ept clean. It is possible to order disposable latex \"calf -birthing\" glo ves with longer sleev es from a v eterinarian for immunocompromised individuals. These glo ves should offer protection from the organisms that are present in the fish tank. Do not let y our pet drink from the toilet, eat other animal' s feces, or eat an y type of dead animal or garbage. It is best to restrict cats to the indoors only . Dogs should be k ept indoors or on a leash. Man y communities ha ve volunteer groups and v eterinarians that will assist people with HIV tak e care of their pets, if needed. Do not hesitate to consult y our veterinarian with y our questions. Kitchen Safety and Proper Food Preparation Wash hands thoroughly before preparing food and use care when tasting food. Use a clean spoon and w ash the spoon after using it once. P eople with HIV infection should a void unpasteuriz ed milk, r aw eggs or products that contain r aw eggs, r aw fish, and cr acked or non-intact eggs. Cook all meat, eggs, and fish thoroughly to kill an y organisms that ma y be present in them. W ash fruits and v egetables thoroughly before eating. Disinfect countertops, sto ves, sinks, refriger ators, door handles, and floors regularly . Use window screens to prev ent insects from entering the room. Discard food that has expired or is past a safe stor age date, shows signs of mold, or smells bad. Use separ ate cutting boards for meat and for fruits and v egetables. Disinfect cutting boards frequently . Avoid wooden cutting boards if possible. Kitchen garbage should be contained in a leakproof , washable receptacle that is lined with a plastic bag. Seal the garbage liner bags and remo ve the garbage frequently . Safe and Legal Disposal of SharpsDisposal of sharps, which includes syringes, needles, and lancets is regulated. They can carry hepatitis, HIV , and other germs that cause disease. Throwing them in the tr ash or flushing them down the toilet can pose health risks for others. R egulations go verning disposal of sharps protect garbage and other utilit y work ers and the gener al public from needlesticks and illness. There are different rules and disposal options for different circumstances. Contact y our local health department to determine which option applies to your situation. Found Syringes in Public Lo cations Syringes that are found in parks, along roadsides, in laundromats, or in other public locations present potential risk for accidental needlesticks. Risks for infection from a found syringe depends on a v ariety of factors, including the amount of time the syringe w as left out, the presence of blood, and the t ype of injury (scr atch v ersus puncture). The risk of HIV infection to a healthcare work er from a needlestick containing HIV -positiv e blood is about 1 in 300, according to CDC data. Anyone with an accidental needlestick requires an assessment b y a medical professional. Clinicians should mak e certain that the injured person had been v accinated against hepatitis B and tetanus and ma y also recommend testing for HIV , HCV , and HBV . If a found syringe is handled, but no needlestick occurred, testing for HIV is not necessary . Safe Disp osal of Found Syringes Found used syringes or needles a risk for HIV , HBV , HCV , and other pathogens. Parents and other caregiv ers should mak e sure children understand they should nev er touch a found needle or syringe, but instead should immediately ask a responsible adult for help. Your local health department can pro vide a list of what disposal sites are a vailable to you. For safe disposal of found syringes: If you find a syringe or needle, do not pick it up with y our bare hands. W ear glo ves and use tongs, a sho vel, or a broom and dustpan to pick it up . Hold the needle a way from y our body . Do not break the needle off from the syringe. Do not flush needles or syringes down the toilet! Place used sharps and syringes in a safe container: one with at least a 1-inch opening and a lid that will seal tightly . An empt y plastic laundry detergent, shampoo , pickle, oil, or similar bottle or jar will work. If a glass jar is used, place it into a larger plasticbucket or container that has a tight -fitting lid. Soda cans are not good containers to use because people often try to recy cle discarded cans. Carefully place the needle or syringe into the bottle or jar and seal the lid tightly . Tape it shut for added safet y, and label it with the w arning: Sharps, Do Not R ecycle. The sealed container should not be placed where children might open it. Testing and Counselin g The CDC believ es that man y people in the United States ha ve HIV but ha ve not been tested for it. These people do not know they are infected and that they need medical care. Without being identified as a carrier of HIV they can unknowingly pass HIV infection on to others. Some people do not find out that they are infected with HIV until they get sick or show symptoms and go to a clinic or hospital and get a test to find out their HIV status. Since most people don' t have symptoms for y ears, they do not find out their status until later in the disease progression. By the time they find out they are infected, they ha ve missed opportunities to tak e care of their health and a void passing the infection on to others. It is important for an yone at risk of HIV infection to get tested. Those who are uninfected can learn to tak e steps to a void infection and those who are infected can be proactiv e to tak e care of their own health as well as to a void passing the infection on to others. HIV Antibody Tests The first HIV antibody test became a vailable in 1985. Since then, new HIV antibody tests have been dev eloped and appro ved by the F ood and Drug Administr ation (FDA). Currently , these antibody tests in volve a two-step process utilizing a screening test and, when the screening test is reactiv e it is positiv e, which is a confirmatory test . Step 1: Screening Test. The first test done on a specimen is a screening test called an enzyme-link ed immunosorbent assa y (EIA or ELIS A). This t ype of test screens for the presence of antibodies to HIV in blood, urine, or or al fluid. Screening tests are inexpensiv e and highly accur ate. Most HIV antibody screening tests are con ventional, in that the specimen is collected from the client and sent to a labor atory for testing. If a screening test is negativ e (no HIV antibodies are detected), the results can be released to the client. If the screening test is reactiv e (positiv e) at the labor atory, a confirmatory W estern Blot test is conducted on the same sample.Rapid tests are also screening tests, but they are conducted at the test site, often with the client present, and negativ e results are a vailable in under an hour . Reactiv e (antibodies detected) results from a r apid test must be confirmed. This is done because there is a small chance that an HIV screening test ma y detect proteins related to other autoimmune diseases and react to those proteins with a false positiv e result. Step 2: Confirmatory Testing. If a rapid test is reactiv e, an additional specimen must be drawn from the client and sent to the lab for confirmatory W estern Blot testing. The HIV Western Blot detects antibodies to the individual proteins that mak e up HIV . This test is much more specific, and therefore more costly , than the EIA screening test. False Results. Someone not infected with HIV ma y test reactiv e on a screening test because the test detected proteins related to other autoimmune diseases and ga ve a positiv e result. F or this reason, it is critical that reactiv e screening tests be v erified with a confirmatory test and that clients not be told they are infected with HIV unless the confirmatory test v erifies that HIV antibodies are present. A false negativ e may result during the window period before antibodies ha ve been created. F or people at high risk who receiv e a negativ e HIV test, retesting at three months is recommended. All babies born to mothers with HIV will ha ve HIV antibodies present in their blood but ma y not actually ha ve HIV. Apply Your Knowledge Q: A friend suspects they ha ve been exposed to HIV through sexual contact and w ant the fastest test to find out if they ha ve HIV . How would y ou explain the testing process? A: They can ha ve a blood test called ELIS A, which detects if there are antibodies triggered b y HIV , and results can be determined within 20 minutes. If the ELIS A is positiv e, an additional blood test, the W estern Blot T est, must be sent to a lab , which takes about a week. There are fingerstick blood tests a vailable as an initial screening; howev er, all must be v erified b y a W estern Blot T est. Because of the window period (the delay before serocon version), a followup blood test should be done after three months. Antibody Testing Specim en Options HIV antibody tests are designed to detect HIV antibodies in blood, urine, or or al fluid (or al mucosa tr ansudate) samples. BloodRapid Test Kit Contents of the CAPI LLUS HIV-1/HIV-2 Rapid Test Kit that tests whole blood, serum, or plasma. Source: CD C.The most frequently used HIV antibody test detects HIV antibodies in blood. Depending on test t ype, blood from a v enipuncture or fingerstick will be used. This is the test that is used most often in public health clinics and doctors' offices. Most r apid screening tests use fingerstick blood. As with all screening tests, reactiv e blood screening tests must be confirmed with a Western Blot test. F or most HIV testing, this confirmatory testing is done on the same sample in the labor atory. For reactiv e rapid tests, an additional sample needs to be dr awn and sent to the labor atory. Oral Fluid This test detects HIV antibodies in the mucous membr ane (or al mucosal tr ansudate) of the mouth. The or al test kit uses a special collection device that looks lik e a toothbrush. No needles are used. There are some r apid tests that use or al fluids. Man y public health clinics also offer or al fluid testing. Some pro vide r apid or al fluid testing. As with all screening tests, positiv e oral fluid screening tests must be confirmed with a W estern Blot test. It is important to note that although antibodies to HIV can be found in saliv a and or al fluids, these fluids do not contain sufficient amounts of the virus to be infectious and therefore are not considered a risk for tr ansmitting the virus. Urine A urine-based test for HIV antibodies is a vailable for use only in ph ysician' s offices or medical clinics. It tests for HIV antibodies in the urine. It is important to note that, ev en though antibodies to HIV can be found in urine, urine is not considered a risk for transmitting the virus. As with all screening tests, a positiv e urine HIV screening test must be confirmed with a W estern Blot test, which can be done on the same specimen. Rapid HIV Test The rapid HIV test is a screening test that can pro vide results in less than an hour . Rapid testing can be conducted on blood and/or or al mucosal tr ansudate, depending on the t ype of test. As with all screening tests, any reactiv e rapid test result must be confirmed with a conventional W estern Blot test. Home Test Kits [Material in this section is from FDA, 2012.]The first licensed and FDA -appro ved test kit for home HIV antibody testing is the \"Home Access HIV -1 Test System\" manufactured b y Home Access Health Corpor ation. The test requires a few drops of blood, which is mailed to the compan y in a safe mailer . If the screening test is reactiv e, a confirmatory W estern Blot test is done b y the same labor atory so that final results are a vailable to clients. The client calls the compan y to learn the results o ver the phone. The second test kit w as appro ved when, \"On July 3, 2012 the F ood and Drug Administr ation (FDA) appro ved the 'Or aQuick In-Home HIV T est,\" a rapid home-use HIV test kit that does not require sending a sample to a labor atory for analysis. The kit provides a test result in 20 to 40 minutes, and y ou can test y ourself in y our own home. The kit, which tests a sample of fluid from y our mouth, is appro ved for sale in stores and online to an yone age 17 and older . The FDA noted that positiv e test results using the Or aQuick test must be confirmed b y followup labor atory-based testing, and that the test can be falsely negativ e for reasons that include ha ving been exposed to HIV within three months before testing. Those who engage in risky beha viors should be re-tested on a regular basis and should not interpret a negativ e test to mean that such high-risk beha viors are safe. If you are unsure if an HIV test is FDA appro ved, you can check the FDA list, which is available online (see R esources section at the end of the course). Internet Test Kits Although other home test kits ma y be ordered o ver the Internet, they ma y not be appro ved by the FDA and are not guar anteed to be accur ate. The CDC does not recommend using an y test that has not been appro ved by the FDA. Other HIV Tests There are sev eral other methods for testing HIV , including the p24 antigen test, the plasma HIV RNA or pro viral DNA test, and the HIV vir al load test. T ests and testing procedures are constantly being refined and updated. p24 Antigen Test This blood test measures a core protein of HIV . This protein occurs during primary infection (the first weeks of infection) but ma y disappear as soon as antibodies to the virus are present. Because of this, and because of the expense of the test, p24 antigen tests are currently only a vailable under limited circumstances. Plasma HIV RNA or Proviral DNA TestsThese blood tests ma y be run on people with suspected new HIV infection. They are expensiv e and not used as screening tests for the gener al public. Howev er, anyone who has had a potential exposure to HIV through unprotected sex or sharing needles, and who presents with symptoms of primary infection (usually seen within the first 2 weeks of infection with HIV) should ask their medical pr actitioner if this test is advisable. HIV Viral Load Test This test measures the amount of HIV in an infected person' s bloodstream. It is r arely used to diagnose HIV infection. It is most often used in individuals who are HIV -positiv e to measure the effectiv eness of antiretro viral medications used to treat HIV infection. Getting Tested for HIV Who Should Be T ested? Anyone who has put themselv es at risk through anal, v aginal, or or al sex, or shared needles and an yone who has had an occupational exposure, ma y benefit from HIV testing. People ma y have partners with risk factors, and these people (along with their partners) should consider testing. F or occupational exposure, refer to y our emplo yer protocol. Where to Test for HIV People ma y get an HIV test at public health departments, through their medical pro vider, family planning, or sexually tr ansmitted disease clinics and at some communit y clinics. Confidential Testing With confidential HIV testing, clients do giv e their real name, and the information about their testing is maintained in medical records. Their results are confidential. R esults and testing information are not released to others ex cept when medically necessary or under special circumstances such as when they sign a release for the results to be giv en to another person or agency . HIV is a reportable condition, therefore confidential HIV results are reported to local public health officials. Anonymous Testing An anon ymous HIV antibody test means that the clients don' t give their name and the person who orders or performs the test does not maintain a record of the name of the person they are testing. Informed Consent RequiredHIV testing can only be done with the person' s consent. Consent ma y be contained within a comprehensiv e consent for medical treatment. It can be v erbal or written but must be specific to HIV and must be documented. There are some r are ex ceptions where a person can be tested without their consent, including source testing relating to occupation exposures and legally mandated situations specified in state la w. Testing Information and Risk Assessm ent Required Aside from the ex ceptions listed abo ve, all people tested for HIV should be assessed for their risk of infection and unless previously tested and ha ving declined information, be provided with appropriate information about the test, including, but not limited to: The benefits of learning their HIV status and the potential dangers of the disease How HIV is tr ansmitted and w ay in which it can be prev ented Meaning of HIV test results and the importance of obtaining the results As appropriate, the a vailabilit y of anon ymous testing and the differences between anonymous and confidential testing HIV Antibody Test Results Antibody test results can be negativ e, positiv e, or indeterminate. A negativ e test result is not certain until y ou ha ve passed the window period. The Window Period It is important to remember that HIV antibody testing has a window period. The window period is the time between initial infection with the virus and when the HIV -infected person dev elops enough antibodies to be detected b y the antibody test. Until the infected person' s immune system mak es enough antibodies to be detected, the test will be negativ e even though the person is infected with HIV . Some infected people are able to produce antibodies as early as 2 weeks after infection. Almost ev eryone will dev elop enough antibodies to be detected b y 12 weeks after infection. Unfortunately , there is no w ay to know how long each infected person will tak e to dev elop antibodies. Howev er, virtually ev eryone who is infected will produce enough antibodies for detection b y 12 weeks (3 months). Therefore, to be sure, people should test 3 months after the last potential HIV exposure ev en if an initial screening is negativ e.Because people who are newly infected ha ve so few antibodies to fight HIV , the virus can grow and multiply uncheck ed. During this time, they can ha ve a large amount of virus in their blood, making them highly infectious for HIV . During the window period it is possible for an infected person to test negativ e (before they dev elop antibodies) but still be able to infect another person. Negative Results If the test result is negativ e, it means one of two things: Either the person is not infected with the virus, or The person became infected recently and has not produced enough antibodies to be detected b y the test If a person is concerned about a recent incident, they should test 3 months from the date of their last possible exposure. A negativ e test result does not mean a person is immune to HIV. If risky beha vior continues, infection ma y occur . Positive Results A positiv e confirmatory test indicates the presence of HIV antibodies and that the person: Is infected with HIV Can spread the virus to others through unsafe sexual pr actices, sharing contaminated injection equipment, or breastfeeding Is infected for life Indeterminate Results Occasionally , a Western Blot test result will come back with an indeterminate or inconclusiv e test result. If a person has recently engaged in beha viors that put them at risk for getting HIV , it could mean that they are newly infected with HIV and are slowly developing antibodies, or seroconverting . If serocon version is suspected, RNA testing can determine if the HIV virus is present. If RNA testing is not a vailable, a second specimen should be gathered and tested with an antibody test. If serocon version is present, this second test ma y give a positiv e result. Indeterminate results are not alw ays indicativ e of serocon version. They can also be caused by cross reaction with other proteins from sev eral sources, including pregnancy , other autoimmune diseases, and recent influenza v accinations.For low -risk people when serocon version is not suspected, retesting should be conducted at 1 month and at 3 months from the last possible exposure to v erify that they are not infected. Non-infection is indicated if the subsequent tests continue to be indeterminate (without additional HIV antibody protein bands) or negativ e. Indeterminate results for low -risk clients are r are. It is possible that some uninfected people ma y always test indeterminate due to the cross reaction from protein bands from something other than HIV . Other uninfected people who first test indeterminate ma y clear their bodies of those other proteins that are causing the cross reaction and, in subsequent tests, test negativ e. Still others go back and forth between indeterminate and negativ e. Counseling messages should explain that only HIV -positiv e tests indicate infection with HIV and that some people test indeterminate because of non-HIV proteins in their bodies that register on the test. No further testing for other diseases is indicated. Advantages of Early Testing for HIV Infection New drug ther apies for HIV infection can sustain an infected person' s health for long periods of time. Early detection allows people with HIV the option to receiv e medical treatment sooner , take better care of their immune system, and sta y healthier longer . Additionally , early detection of HIV allows people to tak e precautions not to infect others. Answers: D, ATest Your Learning A negativ e HIV test result means this person: A positiv e HIV test result means this person:Is immune to HIV and can nev er become infected. A.

D.Counseling with HIV Testing The person who pro vides HIV test counseling to clients should direct the counseling tow ard increasing client 's understanding of their own risk of acquiring or tr ansmitting HIV , motiv ating them to reduce their risk, and assisting them to build skills to reduce their risk. Pre-Test Counselin g Pre-test counseling should be based on recommendations of the CDC' s 2006 Revised Recommendations for HIV Testing of Adults, Adolescents, and Pregnant Women in Health- Care Settings (latest a vailable). Pre-test counseling should alw ays: Assist the individual to set realistic beha vior-change goals and establish str ategies for reducing their risk of acquiring or tr ansmitting HIV Provide appropriate risk reduction skills-building opportunities to support their behavior change goals Provide or refer for other appropriate prev ention, support, or medical services Post-Test Counselin g Those who test HIV negativ e should be offered an individual counseling session at the time they receiv e their test results. F or those clients who test HIV -positiv e, counseling can' t just be offered, it must be pro vided or referred and in addition to what is pro vided to HIV - negativ e clients, must also include: If confidentially tested, the information that HIV is a reportable condition Either the pro vision of partner notification support or referr al to public health for these services Appropriate referr als for alcohol and drug and mental health counseling, medical evaluation, TB screening, and HIV prev ention and other support services Testing Confidentiality Information about a person' s HIV test and results is confidential and must not be shared with others. P eople who perform HIV counseling and testing in public health departments or health districts must sign strict confidentialit y agreements. These agreements regulate the personal information that ma y be rev ealed in counseling and testing sessions as well as test results. HIV test results are k ept in lock ed files, with only a few appropriate staff members ha ving access to them.HIV Testing: Pregnancy [Material from this section was retrieved on January 8, 2018 from https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/group/gender/pregnantwomen/opt- out.html.] In the 2006 R evised R ecommendations for HIV T esting of Adults, Adolescents, and Pregnant W omen in Health-Care Settings, CDC recommended the opt -out approach to testing for all adult and adolescent patients in healthcare settings, including pregnant women. These recommendations emphasiz e: Universal \"opt -out\" HIV testing for all pregnant women early in ev ery pregnancy . A second test in the third trimester in certain geogr aphic areas or for women who are known to be at high risk of becoming infected (eg, injection-drug users and their sex partners, women who ex change sex for money or drugs, women who are sex partners of HIV -infected persons, and women who ha ve had a new or more than one sex partner during this pregnancy). Rapid HIV testing at labor and deliv ery for women without a prenatal test result. Explor ation of reasons that women decline testing. Studies show that the opt -out approach can: Increase testing r ates among pregnant women, thereb y increasing the number of pregnant women who know their HIV status. Increase the number of HIV -infected women who are offered treatment. Reduce HIV tr ansmission to their babies. How is opt -out implemented in the healthcare setting? Opt-out comprises three steps for healthcare pro viders to follow to put this approach into practice (CDC recommends all three steps): Tell all pregnant women that an HIV test will be performed as part of the standard group of tests for pregnant women. Tell all pregnant women that they ma y decline this test. Give all pregnant women information about how to prev ent HIV tr ansmission during pregnancy and pro vide information about treatment for pregnant women who are HIV-positiv e. HIV Testing: Sexua l Assa ultSexual assault is prev alent in the United States. In 2010 the CDC began annual collection of comprehensiv e data on sexual violence victimization, including r ape, with the National Intimate Sexual Violence Surv ey (NISVS). The last reported y ear of data in 2011 indicate that more than 23 million women were r aped at some point in their lifetime, and 40% of those r apes took place before the women reached age 18. In addition, nearly 2 million men report being r aped at some point in their lifetime (NISVS , 2011). Unfortunately , a study found that r ape is hugely underreported in the United States due to women not w anting to report the crime and official records undercounting to \"create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime\" (Y ung, 2014). For the 12-month period preceding the 2011 data collection, 1,929,000 women reported being r aped, and 6,687,000 subjected to other forms of sexual violence. Although r ape data for men w as not a vailable, 5,797,000 of them reported being subjected to other kinds of sexual violence during that one- year period (NISVS , 2011). Apart from the emotional and ph ysical tr auma that accompan y sexual assault, man y victims are concerned about HIV infection from the r apist. Sexual Assa ult HIV Risks According to CDC, the odds of HIV infection from a sexual assault in the United States are 2 in 1,000. While this is a low risk, the fear of HIV poses an additional emotional burden on people who ha ve been victims of sexual assault. HIV Testing When assault victims are worried about HIV , testing can help their healing process. Almost all such HIV tests will be negativ e and thus pro vide emotional relief to the victim. The v ery few who do test HIV -positiv e will need that information both for obtaining healthcare and as evidence in possible criminal court cases. Assa ult and the Window Period The window period for HIV antibody testing must be tak en into account when testing after an assault. R ecall that it tak es from 2 to 12 weeks after exposure for antibodies to show up in an HIV test. An y test conducted shortly after the assault rev eals only the original status of the victim. An early test can, howev er, provide proof that the victim w as HIV -negativ e at the time of the assault, which ma y be useful as evidence in a criminal case. To verify that the victim w as not infected b y the assault, it is necessary to test again after the window period. If , following an earlier HIV -negativ e result, the second test is HIV - positiv e, it indicates that the victim w as infected b y the assault (assuming no other opportunit y for infection occurred in the interim).Other Testing When counseling assault victims about the risk of HIV , remember that the risk of HIV is low but there other potentially higher risks to be addressed. The risk of other STDs and pregnancy are much higher than HIV . Victims of sexual assault should be tested for STDs and females giv en emergency contr aception. The emergency contr aception hotline number (888 668 2528) should be pro vided b y telephone r ape counselors or other health care professionals. Most experts recommend that a sexual assault victim should go directly to the nearest hospital emergency room, without first changing their clothing, bathing, or showering. Trained staff in the emergency department will counsel the victim, and ma y also offer testing or referr al for HIV , STDs, and pregnancy . It is common pr actice for the ED ph ysician or Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner (S ANE) nurse to tak e DNA samples of blood or semen from the v agina, rectum, and perineal and adjacent areas, which can be used as evidence against the attack er. Unfortunately man y hospitals do not ha ve a dedicated S ANE nurse or adequate testing materials and if r ape victims are referred to another hospital, the victim may decide to do without the in vasive medical care and testing. Some EDs ma y refer sexual assault surviv ors to the local health jurisdiction for HIV testing. Many people feel that the ED setting is a profoundly unpleasant one in which to question sexual assault victims regarding their sexual risks history . Howev er, testing shortly after a sexual assault pro vides baseline information on their status for v arious STD infections. All testing to be used for baseline information and legal action should be done confidentially . Assa ilant Testing The victim needs to consider whether to start post exposure proph ylaxis (PEP) independent of the source' s test result, because the time between the attack and the con viction will likely be longer than the 24 to 48 hours time fr ame recommended for starting PEP . Partner Notification Partner notification is a v oluntary service pro vided to HIV positiv e people and their sexual partners or injecting-drug-sharing partners. This service is pro vided using a v ariety of strategies to maintain the confidentialit y of both the HIV -infected client and the partners. HIV-infected people are counseled about the importance of their partners' being notified of exposure to HIV and offered an HIV test. Clients can choose to notif y their partners themselv es or to ha ve public health staff notif y them. When public health staff notif y partners, they notif y them of their exposure, pro vide counseling and information, and offer HIV testing without rev ealing the partner who tested HIV positiv e. Natural History of HIV Infection Viral transmission Primary HIV infection Serocon version Asymptomatic HIV infection Symptomatic HIV infection AIDS The first three constitute the window period.Partner notification is a critical tool for those notified because it alerts them to the need for being tested. If they are uninfected, they can tak e steps to ensure they don' t become infected. If infected, they can tak e steps to care for their own health and to ensure that they do not pass the virus on to others. Reporting Requirements AIDS cases ha ve been reportable to the CDC since 1984, when the existence of the syndrome that follows HIV infection w as clearly established. Clinica l Manifestations and Treatment Natural History of HIV Infection A person with untreated HIV infection will experience sev eral stages in infection. These include vir al transmission, primary HIV infection, serocon version, asymptomatic HIV infection, symptomatic HIV infection, and AIDS. These stages as sometimes called the \"natur al history\" of disease progression and are described below . The natur al history of HIV infection has been altered dr amatically in dev eloped countries because of new medications. In countries where there is no access to these expensiv e medications, or in cases where people do not become a ware of their HIV infection until v ery late, the disease progresses as described below . Viral Transmission Viral transmission is the initial infection with HIV . People infected with HIV ma y become infectious to others within 5 da ys. They are infectious before the onset of an y symptoms, and they will remain infectious for the rest of their liv es. Primary HIV Infection During the first few weeks of HIV infection, individuals ha ve a very high lev el of virus (vir al load) in their bloodstream. The high vir al load means the individual can easily pass the virus to others. Unfortunately , during primary infection man y people are una ware that they are infected.In this stage, about half of infected people ha ve symptoms of fev er, swollen glands (in the neck, armpits, groin), r ash, fatigue, and a sore throat. These symptoms, which resemble mononucleosis, go a way in a few weeks, but the individual continues to be infectious to others. It is extremely important that healthcare pro viders consider the diagnosis of primary HIV infection if clients engage in beha viors that put them at risk for HIV and are presenting with the abo ve symptoms. If individuals experience these symptoms after ha ving unprotected sex or sharing needles, they should seek medical care and tell their pro vider why they are concerned about HIV infection. Window Period and Seroconversion The window period begins with initial infection and continues until the virus can be detected b y an HIV antibody test. Serocon version is the term for the point at which HIV antibodies are detectable and the window period ends. Natural Course of Untreated HIV Infection The first two weeks following infection are highly contagious but not detectable b y HIV tests (see figure below). Antibodies ma y begin to appear after 2 weeks but tak e up to 12 weeks or longer to reach serocon version. As is seen on the line curv es, the vir al load continues to increase until there are sufficient antibodies to suppress, but not kill, the virus. Once the antibodies become activ e, an untreated patient ma y be asymptomatic for 10 years before the antibodies are no longer able to suppress the virus and the person becomes symptomatic. Natural Course of Untreated HIV Infection Source: Ad apted from Conway & Bartlett, 2003. Asymptomatic HI V Infection Following serocon version, a person infected with HIV is asymptomatic (has no noticeable signs or symptoms). The person ma y look and feel health y, but can still pass the virus to others. It is not unusual for an HIV -infected person to liv e 10 y ears or longer without an y outward ph ysical signs of progression to AIDS . Mean while, the person' s blood and other systems are affected b y HIV , which would be reflected in labor atory tests. Unless a person in this stage has been tested for HIV , they will probably not be a ware they are infected. Symptomatic HI V Infection During the symptomatic stage of HIV infection, a person begins to ha ve noticeable ph ysical symptoms that are related to HIV infection. An yone who has symptoms lik e these and has engaged in beha viors that tr ansmit HIV should seek medical advice. The only w ay to know for sure if y ou are infected with HIV is to tak e an HIV antibody test. Although no symptoms are specific only to HIV infection, some common symptoms are: Persistent low -grade fev er Pronounced weight loss that is not due to dieting Persistent headaches Diarrhea that lasts more than 1 month Difficult y reco vering from colds and the flu Being sick er than they normally would with ordinary illnesses Recurrent v aginal y east infections in women Thrush/y east infection coating the mouth or tongue Apply Your Learning Q: A client comes into y our clinic complaining of a fev er of 99 \u00baF for 3 weeks, weight loss of 15 pounds in the past 2 months, and diarrhea for 6 weeks. He claims he has not changed his regular diet and is not trying to lose weight. He states he has had a lingering cold for weeks and just doesn' t feel good or ha ve energy . What additional history and physical factors would y ou need to assess? A: These are classic symptoms of an HIV infection but could also be a gastro intestinal or respir atory virus. Sexual history , diet history , and family history of GI diseases would need to be assessed. A chest x -ray, CBC, basic metabolic panel, and th yroid lev els should be ordered to rule out pneumonia, infections, th yroid health, and inflammatory conditions. It is said as high as 90% of a diagnosis can be determined b y a thorough history alone. AIDS Did you know . . . An AIDS diagnosis can only be made b y a licensed healthcare pro vider and, once the diagnosis is made, the person is alw ays considered to have AIDS . An AIDS diagnosis is based on the result of HIV -specific blood tests and/or on the person' s physical condition. Established AIDS-defining illnesses, white blood cell counts, and other conditions are specifically link ed to making an AIDS diagnosis. Once a person is diagnosed with AIDS , even if they later feel better , they do not \"go backw ards\" in the classification system for HIV infection. They are alw ays considered to ha ve AIDS . People who ha ve an AIDS diagnosis ma y often appear to a casual observ er to be quite health y, but they continue to be infectious and can pass the virus to others. Ov er time, people with AIDS frequently ha ve a reduced white blood count and dev elop poorer health. They ma y also ha ve a significant amount of virus present in their blood, measureable as viral load. Cofactors A cofactor is a separ ate condition that can change or speed up the course of disease. There are sev eral cofactors that can increase the r ate of progression to AIDS . They include a person' s age, certain genetic factors, and possibly drug use, smoking, nutrition, and HCV . Time from Infection to DeathIf the infection is untreated, the a verage time from HIV infection to death is 10 to 12 years. Early detection and continuing medical treatment ha ve been shown to prolong life for man y more y ears. AIDS Surveillance Case Definition [This section was taken from CDC, 2014.] Following extensiv e consultation and peer review , the CDC and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists ha ve revised and combined the surv eillance case definitions for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection into a single case definition for people of all ages, which includes adults and adolescents aged 13 y ears and children aged <13 y ears. The revisions were made to address multiple issues, the most important of which w as the need to adapt to recent changes in diagnostic criteria. Labor atory criteria for defining a confirmed case now accommodate new multi-test algorithms, including criteria for differentiating between HIV -1 and HIV -2 infection and for recognizing early HIV infection. A confirmed case can be classified in one of fiv e HIV infection stages: 0, 1, 2, 3, or unknown. Early infection, recogniz ed by a negativ e HIV test within 6 months of HIV diagnosis, is classified as stage 0, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is classified as stage 3. Criteria for stage 3 ha ve been simplified b y eliminating the need to differentiate between definitiv e and presumptiv e diagnoses of opportunistic illnesses. Clinical (non-labor atory) criteria for defining a case for surv eillance purposes ha ve been made more pr actical b y eliminating the requirement for information about labor atory tests. The surv eillance case definition is intended primarily for monitoring the HIV infection burden and planning for prev ention and care on a population lev el, not as a basis for clinical decisions for individual patients (CDC, 2014). Since the first cases of AIDS were reported in the United States in 1981, surv eillance case definitions for HIV infection and AIDS ha ve undergone sev eral revisions to respond to diagnostic adv ances. This new document updates the surv eillance case definitions originally published in 2008. It addresses multiple issues, the most important of which w as the need to adapt to recent changes in diagnostic criteria. Other needs that prompted the revision included: Recognition of early HIV infection Differentiation between HIV -1 and HIV -2 infections Consolidation of staging systems for adults/adolescents and childrenSimplification of criteria for opportunistic illnesses indicativ e of AIDS Revision of criteria for reporting diagnoses without laboratory evidence (CDC, 2014)Stage 3-Defining Opportunistic Illnesses in HIV Infection Bacterial infections, multiple or recurrent* Candidiasis of bronchi, tr achea, or Cytomegalo virus disease (other than liv er, spleen, or nodes), onset at age >1 month Cytomegalo virus retinitis (with loss of vision) Encephalopath attributed to HIV\u00a7 Herpes simplex: chronic s or esophagitis >1 kansasii , disseminated or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium tuberculosis of an y site, pulmonary, disseminated, or extrapulmonary Mycobacterium, other species or unidentified species, disseminated or extrapulmonary Pneumocystis jirovecii (previously known as e multifocal leuk oencephalopath y Salmonella septicemia, recurrent Toxoplasmosis of br ain, onset at age >1 month Wasting syndrome attributed to HIV * Only among children aged <6 years.

Clinical Manifestations vs. Opportunistic Infections When their immune system is suppressed, people ha ve weak er defenses against the wide variety of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens that are present almost everywhere. A clinical manifestation is the ph ysical result of some t ype of illness or infection. The opportunistic infections associated with HIV include an y of the infections that are part of an AIDS-defining classification. F or example, the opportunistic infection cytomegalo virus often causes the clinical manifestation of blindness in people with AIDS . HIV in the Body Scientists are alw ays learning new information about how HIV affects the body . HIV infection seems to affect man y body systems. It is well known that HIV infection causes a gradual, pronounced decline in the immune system' s functioning. P eople with HIV are at risk for a wide v ariety of illnesses, both common and ex otic. HIV affects the: Kind and number of blood cells Amount of fat and muscle distribution in the body Structure and functioning of the br ain Normal functioning of the immune system Body' s basic metabolism HIV infection can cause man y painful or uncomfortable conditions, including: Confusion or dementia Diarrhea Fatigue Fever Nausea or v omiting Painful joints, muscles, or nerv e pain Difficult y with breathing Urinary or fecal incontinence Vision or hearing lossThrush (y east infections in the mouth) Chronic pneumonias, sinusitis, or bronchitis Loss of muscle tissue and body weight Answer: CTest Your Learning Opportunistic diseases and infections: HIV in Children Children show significant differences in their HIV disease progression and their virologic and immunologic responses when compared to adults. Without drug treatment, children may have dev elopmental dela y, failure to thriv e, recurrent bacterial infections such as P. carinii pneumonia, and other conditions related to low immune response. The antiretro viral treatments that are a vailable for HIV infection ma y not be a vailable in pediatric formulations. The medications ma y have different side effects in children than they do in adults. It is vital that women know their HIV status before and during pregnancy . Antiretro viral treatment significantly reduces the chance that their child will become infected with HIV . Prior to the dev elopment of antiretro viral ther apies, most HIV -infected children were v ery sick b y 7 years of age. In 1994 scientists disco vered that a short treatment course of the medication AZT for pregnant women dr amatically reduced the number and r ate of children who became infected perinatally . Cesarean sections for deliv ery ma y be w arranted in certain cases to reduce HIV tr ansmission. As a result, perinatal HIV infections ha ve substantially declined in the dev eloped world.Are seen only during the window period of HIV infection.A. Affect the kind and number of blood cells in HIV -infected patients. B. Are caused b y a suppressed immune system that weak ens defenses against bacteria, viruses, and fungi.C. Are the ph ysical result of some t ype of illness or infection. D.Early diagnosis of HIV infection in newborns is now possible. Antiretro viral ther apy for infants is now the standard of care and should be started as soon as the child is determined b y testing to be HIV -infected. Apparently uninfected children who are born to HIV-positiv e mothers are currently treated with antiretro viral medicines for 6 weeks to reduce an y possibilit y of HIV tr ansmission. Did you know . . . Women with HIV who tak e antiretro viral medication during pregnancy as recommended can reduce the risk of tr ansmitting HIV to their babies to less than 1%. Answer: BTest Your Learning HIV infection in children: HIV in Women Certain str ains of HIV ma y infect women more easily . The str ain of HIV present in Thailand seems to tr ansmit more easily to women through sexual intercourse. Scientists believ e that women and receptiv e partners are more easily infected with HIV than insertiv e partners. Receptiv e partners are at greater risk for tr ansmission of an y sexually tr ansmitted disease, including HIV . Women infected with HIV are at increased risk for a number of gynecologic problems, including pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), abscesses of the fallopian tubes and o varies, and recurrent y east infections. Some studies ha ve found that HIV -infected women ha ve a higher prev alence of infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Cervical dysplasia is a precancerous condition of the cervix caused b y certain str ains of HPV . Cervical dysplasia in HIV -infected women often becomes more aggressiv e as the woman' s immune system declines. This ma y lead to invasive cervical carcinoma, which is an AIDS-indicator condition. It is important for women with HIV to ha ve more frequent P ap tests than those who are not infected.Has the same disease progression as adults.A. Has been reduced b y using AZT in HIV -infected pregnant women. B. Does not usually cause symptoms until pubert y. C. Causes dev elopmental dela y when treated with drugs too early . D.Several studies ha ve shown that women in the United States who ha ve HIV receiv e fewer healthcare services and HIV medications than men. This ma y be because women aren' t diagnosed or tested as frequently . Access t o Medical Care As the medications that are a vailable to treat HIV infection ha ve become more numerous and complex, HIV care has become a medical specialt y. If possible, people who ha ve HIV infection should seek out a ph ysician who is skilled in the treatment of HIV and AIDS . Your local health department ma y be able to pro vide this information. Impact of New Drugs on Clinical Progression Before 1996 there were three medications a vailable to treat HIV . These drugs were used singly and were of limited benefit. R esearchers in 1996 disco vered that taking combinations of these and newer medications dr amatically reduced the amount of HIV (viral load) in the bloodstream of a person infected with HIV . Two or three different medications are used in combination. Each one targets a separ ate part of the virus and its replication. The reduction of deaths from AIDS in the United States has been primarily attributed to this combination ther apy, called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Not ev eryone with HIV infection benefits from the new drug ther apies. Some people cannot tolerate the unpleasant or serious side effects from the medications. Others cannot adhere to the complex treatment schedule. If patients do not tak e their medication ev ery da y according to their ph ysician' s instructions, the drugs do not work effectiv ely and vir al resistance ma y dev elop. Cost of new drug ther apies can be Insur ance progr ams and go vernment progr ams for individuals with low income pa y for much of the cost of the HIV medicines in many states. These medicines ma y cost upw ards of $2,000 per person each month. P eople who liv e in other countries where the medication is unaffordable ha ve very limited access to the newer ther apies. Although the new drug ther apies work for man y people to k eep the amount of virus in their bodies to v ery low lev els, they are not a cure for HIV . Once ther apy is discontinued, vir al load will increase. Ev en during treatment, vir al replication occurs and the person remains infectious to others.It is now common to see combination drug ther apy referred to simply as ART, or antiretro viral ther apy. New drugs and new guidelines for their usage are not uncommon and information about them can be accessed on the CDC and National Institutes of Health (NIH) AIDSinfo websites. Answer: DTest Your Learning HAAR T ther apy: Resist ance Many people find that o ver time the virus becomes resistant to their medication and they must change medications. This is especially true when the medications are not tak en correctly , but it limits the number of possible drug ther apies the person might be able to use. Side Effects Patients often ha ve unpleasant side effects when they use prescription medications to treat their HIV infection. These side effects include: Nausea Diarrhea Peripher al neuropath y (numbness or pain in feet and hands) Lipodystroph y: changes in body fat distribution, which presents with large fat deposits on the back of the neck, on the stomach area and in breast siz e in women and with pronounced thinning of the arms and legs Interference with the metabolism of or al contr aceptiv es Osteoporosis Diabetes or other changes in glucose metabolism Very high cholesterol or trigly ceridesIs a newly disco vered antiretro viral drug. A. Is a cure for HIV/AIDS . B. Decreases vir al load to a point where patients are no longer contagious. C. Is the primary reason for the reduction of deaths from AIDS in the United States.D.Damage to the nerv ous system, liv er, and/or other body organs Alternative Therapies People ha ve relied on alternativ e (sometimes called complementary) ther apies to treat HIV infection for as long as HIV has been known. Man y people use these treatments along with therapies from their medical pro vider. Other people choose to use only alternativ e therapies. These ther apies comprise a wide r ange of treatments, including vitamins, massage, herbs, naturopathic remedies, and man y more. While there is no evidence of harm from these treatments, there is also v ery little evidence of benefit. Man y of these remedies still ha ve not been studied to see if they help . It is important for people who are taking alternativ e ther apies to tell their medical pro vider what they are using. There ma y be harmful side effects from the inter actions of the \"natur al\" medicine and antiretro virals. F or example, St. John' s Wort is an herbal remedy often used for depression that inter acts negativ ely with HIV medications. Other drugs, including o ver-the-counter (O TC) medications, prescription medications, and street drugs, ma y have serious inter actions with antiretro viral medications. It is extremely important that people on HIV medications tell their doctor , pharmacist, and social work er about all other drugs they tak e. Case Management People living with HIV often seek the assistance of an HIV case manager who can help explain the different t ypes of services a vailable. Most states ha ve systems in place to provide prescription and medical assistance to people living with HIV and AIDS . Contact your local health department or district to find case management in y our communit y. Prevention Strategies Anthon y Fauci, director of the National Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), has stated, \"Prev ention is not unidimensional with HIV , it is a multi dimensional, heterogeneous combination of prev entions\" (NIAID , 2014a). Fauci accompanied the statement a gr aphic entitled \"Combination HIV Prevention\" that included: HIV T esting/Counseling Male Circumcision STI Abuse Clean S yringes Prev Mother to Child Transmission, P ost Exposure Proph ylaxis, Pre Exposure Proph ylaxis] (F auci, 2014) No one prev ention option works all the time with ev ery target group , but each one has shown, and continues to show , frequent measur able success with man y groups. Used together , they ha ve made significant headw ay against HIV (F auci, 2014; NIAID , 2014a). HIV Prevention for Adults and Adolescents with HIV Source: CD C. Treatment as PreventionThe adv ent in 1996 of potent combination antiretro viral ther apy (AR T), sometimes called HAAR T (highly activ e antiretro viral ther apy) or cAR T (effectiv e combination antiretro viral therapy), changed the course of the HIV epidemic. These \"cocktails\" of three or more antiretro viral drugs used in combination ga ve patients and scientists new hope for fighting the epidemic and ha ve significantly impro ved life expectancy \u2014to decades r ather than months. For man y years, scientists believ ed that treating HIV -infected people also significantly reduced their risk of tr ansmitting the infection to sexual and drug-using partners who did not ha ve the virus. The circumstantial evidence w as substantial, but no one had conducted a randomiz ed clinical trial\u2014the gold standard for pro ving an interv ention works. That changed in 2011 with the publication of findings from the HIV Prev ention T rials Network (HPTN) 052 study , a ed clinical trial designed in part to ev aluate whether the early initiation of AR T can prev ent the sexual tr ansmission of HIV among heterosexual couples in which one partner is HIV -infected and the other is not. This landmark study validated that early HIV treatment has a profound prev ention benefit; results showed that the risk of tr ansmitting HIV to an uninfected partner w as reduced b y 96% (HPTN, 2016). As a concept and a str ategy , treating HIV -infected people to impro ve their health and to reduce the risk of on ward tr ansmission\u2014sometimes called treatment as prevention \u2014 refers to the personal and public health benefits of using AR T to continuously suppress HIV viral load in the blood and genital fluids, which decreases the risk of tr ansmitting the virus to others. The pr actice has been used since the mid-1990s to prev ent mother -to-child, or perinatal, tr ansmission of the virus. Research published in 1994 showed that zido vudine, more commonly known as AZT , when given to HIV -infected pregnant women and to their newborns reduced the risk of perinatal transmission from about 25% to 8%. Since then, routinely testing pregnant women and treating infected mothers with AR T during pregnancy , deliv ery, and while breastfeeding, when pr acticed according to recommendations, has reduced the mother 's risk of transmitting HIV to her child b y 90%. Treatment alone won' t solv e the global HIV epidemic, but it is an important element of a multi-pronged attack that includes prev ention efforts, wise in vestment of resources, greater access to screening and medical care, and in volvement b y everyone\u2014local, state, and feder al government; faith-based communities; and priv ate groups and individuals. Providing treatment for people who are living with HIV infection must be the first priorit y and, in order to get treatment, one must be a ware of the need. Thus testing and identification of those with HIV infection become the \"piv otal entry point into the medical care system for both treatment and prev ention\" (CDC, 2013).Vaccine Work on an HIV v accine can be tr aced back three decades to before the first HIV v accine clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health in 1987, y et one researcher has said recently that he believ es the v accine he is working on is still 8 to 10 y ears a way from proving workable in humans. Discour aging as that ma y sound, it tak es a great deal of time to do the work needed to create a v accine, and HIV pro vides some unique challenges (NIAID , 2013; Ha yes, 2017; AIDS .gov, 2015). Vaccines historically ha ve been the most effectiv e means to prev ent and ev en eradicate infectious diseases. Lik e smallpo x and polio v accines, a prev entive HIV v accine could sa ve millions of liv es. Dev eloping safe, effectiv e, and affordable v accines that can prev ent HIV infection in uninfected people is the best hope for controlling and/or ending the HIV epidemic. The long-term goal is to dev elop a safe and effectiv e vaccine that protects people worldwide from getting infected with HIV . Howev er, even if a v accine only protects some people, it could still ha ve a major impact on the r ates of tr ansmission and help control the epidemic, particularly for populations where there is a high r ate of HIV tr ansmission. A partially effectiv e vaccine could decrease the number of people who get infected with HIV , further reducing the number of people who can pass the virus on to others. HIV is a v ery complex, highly changeable virus, and it is different from other viruses because the human immune system nev er fully gets rid of it. Most people who are infected with a virus, ev en a deadly one, reco ver from the infection, and their immune systems clear the virus from their bodies. Once cleared, an immunit y to the virus often dev elops. But humans do not seem to be able to fully clear HIV and dev elop immunit y to it. The body cannot mak e effectiv e antibodies and HIV actually targets, in vades, and then destro ys important cells that the human body needs to fight disease. So far , no person with an established HIV infection has cleared the virus natur ally, and this has made it more difficult to dev elop a prev entive HIV v accine. Scientists continue to dev elop and test v accines in labs, in animals, and ev en in human subjects. T rials allow researchers to test the efficacy and safet y of their v accine candidate, and each trial has yielded important information on the path to dev eloping a widely effectiv e vaccine, but there are still man y challenges to be o vercome. Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)Pre-exposure proph ylaxis (PrEP) is a w ay for people who do not ha ve HIV to help prev ent HIV infection b y taking a pill ev ery da y. The pill contains two medications that are also used, in combination with others, to treat HIV . When someone is exposed to HIV through sex or injection drug use, PrEP can help stop the virus from establishing a permanent infection (CDC, 2014c). Currently , the only pill appro ved by the FDA for use as PrEP for people at v ery high risk of getting HIV infection is called Truvada, and it contains tenofo vir and emtricitabine. These drugs work b y blocking important path ways that HIV uses to set up an infection (AIDS .gov, 2014a). When used consistently , PrEP has been shown to greatly reduce the risk of HIV infection in people who are at substantial risk. In all of the sev eral national and international clinical trials, the risk of getting HIV infection w as lower \u2014up to 92% lower \u2014for participants who took the medications consistently than for those who did not. PrEP is much less effectiv e when it is not tak en consistently (CDC, 2014c). PrEP is a powerful HIV prev ention tool, and can be combined with condoms and other prevention methods to pro vide ev en greater protection than when used alone. P eople who use PrEP must commit to taking the drug daily and seeing their healthcare pro vider ev ery 3 months for HIV testing and other followup (CDC, 2014c). PrEP is not for ev eryone, and in 2014 the U .S. Public Health Service released the first comprehensiv e clinical pr actice guidelines for PrEP , Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for the Prevention of HIV Infection in the United States, 2014: A Clinical Practice Guideline, accompanied b y a supplement with forms and counseling guidance. In 2014 the CDC, in collabor ation with others, launched the nation' s first PrEPline, which enables clinicians (ph ysicians, nurse pr actitioners, and ph ysician assistants) to call toll-free to consult with experts about using pre-exposure proph ylaxis (PrEP) with a patient. PrEP will also pro vide written and online checklists, guidelines, informational material, and educational tools (CDC, 2014c). Tuberculosis, Other STDs, and Hepatitis B and C Because of the interrelationships between HIV , tuberculosis (TB), sexually tr ansmitted diseases, HBV , and HCV , a brief discussion of each requires review b y health care professionals. Tuberculosis and HIVMycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) is tr ansmitted b y airborne droplets from people with active pulmonary or laryngeal TB during coughing, sneezing, or talking. Although TB bacteria can liv e anywhere in the body , infectious pulmonary or laryngeal TB poses the greatest threat to public health. Cause of TB Latent infection, which is asymptomatic and not infectious, can last for a lifetime. A presumptiv e diagnosis of activ e TB is made when there are positiv e test results or acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in sputum or other bodily fluids. The diagnosis is confirmed b y identification of M. tuberculosis on culture, which should be followed b y drug sensitivit y testing of the bacteria. Epidemiology of TB Tuberculosis is one of the world' s deadliest diseases. One-third of the world' s population is infected with TB . Thirteen million Americans, an estimated 4.2%, became sick with TB disease and there were appro ximately 1.5 million TB -related deaths. The CDC estimated that 6% to 10% of all TB cases in America occurred among people who were HIV positiv e (CDC, 2016). In 2013, 9,582 TB cases were reported in the United States. This number and the case rate of 3.0 cases/100,000, both decreased o ver 2012 and are in line with a continuing decrease since the 1992 TB resurgence peak (CDC, 2014e). Transmission and Progression When infectious secretions sneez ed or coughed b y an adult with pulmonary TB are breathed in b y another person, the bacteria ma y come to rest in the lungs. After sev eral weeks the bacteria multiply , and some asymptomatic, pneumonia-lik e symptoms ma y occur. The TB bacteria are carried through the bloodstream and lymph system, pumped through the heart, and then disseminated through the body . The largest amount of bacteria goes to the lungs. In most cases, this process, called primary infection , resolv es by itself and something called delayed-type hyper sensitivity is established. This is measured with the tuberculin skin test. The incubation period for this primary infection is 2 to 10 weeks. In most cases, a latent state of TB dev elops. Ninet y percent of people with latent TB (LTBI) never experience subsequent disease. Other than a positiv e tuberculin skin test, people with latent TB infection ha ve no clinical, r adiogr aphic (x-ray), or labor atory evidence of TB and cannot tr ansmit TB to others.Among the other 10% of infected individuals, the TB infection undergoes reactivation at some time and they dev elop activ e TB. About 5% of newly infected people reactiv ate within the first 2 y ears of primary infection and another 5% will do so at some point later in life. Symptoms of TB The period from initial exposure to con version of the tuberculin skin test is 4 to 12 weeks. During this period, the patient shows no symptoms. The progression to activ e disease and symptoms (such as cough, weight loss, and fev er) usually occurs within the first 2 y ears after infection but ma y occur at an y time. Prevention of TB It is important to recogniz e the beha vioral barriers to TB management, which include deficiencies in treatment regimens, poor client adherence to TB medications, and lack of public a wareness. Primary healthcare pro viders need adequate tr aining in screening, diagnosis, treatment, counseling, and contact tr acing for TB through continuing education progr ams and expert consultation. Promoting patient adherence to the sometimes-complicated medication schedule also requires consider ation of patients' cultur al and ethnic perceptions of their health condition. Providing str ategies and services that address the multiple health problems associated with TB (such as alcohol and drug abuse, homelessness, and mental illness) also builds trust and promotes adherence to treatment plans. A daily regimen of Isoniazid for 9 months is recommended because prospectiv e, randomiz ed trials in HIV -negativ e people indicate that 12 months of treatment is more effectiv e than 6 months of treatment. Although a 9-month regimen of Isoniazid is the preferred regimen for the treatment of L TBI, a 6-month regimen does pro vide substantial protection. In some situations, treatment for 6 months r ather than 9 months ma y be cost -effectiv e and still pro vide a fa vorable outcome. Thus, based on local conditions, health departments or pro viders ma y conclude that a 6-month r ather than a 9-month course of Isoniazid is preferred.Clinical trials ha ve shown that daily prev entive ther apy for 12 months reduces the risk for TB disease b y more than 90% in patients with L TBI who complete a full course of ther apy. There is evidence that 6 months of prev entive ther apy with Isoniazid ma y also prev ent disease in appro ximately 69% of patients who complete the regimen. Ev ery effort should be made to ensure that patients adhere to this ther apy for at least 6 months. Children should receiv e at least 9 months of prev entive ther apy. Treatment of TB and Multidrug-Resistant TB In order to prev ent drug resistance and cure TB , the CDC recommends that TB be treated with a multidrug regimen that ma y last 6 to 12 months. TB/HIV Co-Infection People co-infected with HIV/TB are at consider ably greater risk of dev eloping TB disease than those with TB alone. Studies suggest that the risk of dev eloping TB disease is 7% to 10% each y ear for people who are infected with both M. tuberculosis and HIV , whereas it is 10% o ver a lifetime for a person infected only with M. tuberculosis . In an HIV -infected person, TB disease can dev elop in either of two w ays. A person who already has latent TB infection can become infected with HIV , and then TB disease can develop as the immune system is weak ened. Or , a person who has HIV infection can become infected with M. tuberculosis , and TB disease can then r apidly dev elop because the immune system is not functioning well. Other STDs and HIV The term STD (sexually transmitted disease) refers to more than twent y-five infectious organisms tr ansmitted through sexual activit y and doz ens of clinical syndromes that they cause. Sexually tr ansmitted diseases affect men and women and can be tr ansmitted from mothers to babies during pregnancy and childbirth. They are also called sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Bacterial, Viral, and Other Causes of STD Bacteria cause STDs including chlam ydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Viruses cause herpes, w arts, hepatitis B , and HIV . Scabies are caused b y mites, and pubic lice cause \"crabs.\" Trichomoniasis is caused b y tiny organisms called protoz oa and \"y east\" infections are caused b y fungi. Some STDs, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, can ha ve more than one cause, for example, a woman ma y have both gonorrhea and chlam ydia, causing PID . A man ma y have more than one cause for epididymitis, usually gonorrhea and chlam ydia. Non-gonococcal urethritis (NGU) is usually caused b y bacteria.STD, Nationally and Internationally Since the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, researchers ha ve noted the strong association between HIV and other STDs. The CDC estimates that there are 20 million new STD infections ev ery year, including gonorrhea, chlam ydia, and syphilis\u2014the three that physicians are required to report. Half of these new STD infections occur in y oung people aged 15 to 24 and accrue almost $16 billion in healthcare costs. Since 2015 sa w increases in the three reportable STDs and 1.5 million new cases of chlam ydia w as the highest of an y condition ev er reported to the CDC. Gay and bisexual men face the highest, and continually rising, number of syphilis cases, representing 90% of all cases. S yphilis infection increases the r ate of HIV infection (CDC, 2016). Globally , more than 1 million people acquire a sexually tr ansmitted infection (STI) ev ery day. The term STI is often used to reflect the fact that a person ma y be infected y et show no symptoms of disease. Each y ear 500 million become ill with chlam ydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and trichomoniasis. Drug resistance, especially for gonorrhea, presents a major challenge to fighting these diseases worldwide (WHO , 2013). Primary STD infections ma y cause pregnancy -related complications, congenital infections, infertilit y, ectopic pregnancy , chronic pelvic pain, and cancers. STDs can also acceler ate other infections lik e HIV . HIV and STDs The presence of infection with other STDs increases the risk of HIV tr ansmission because: STDs lik e syphilis and symptomatic herpes can cause breaks in the skin, which provide direct entry for HIV . Inflammation from STDs such as chlam ydia mak es it easier for HIV to enter and infect the body . HIV is often detected in the pus or other discharge from genital ulcers from HIV - infected men and women. Sores can bleed easily and come into contact with v aginal, cervical, or al, urethr al, and rectal tissues during sex. Inflammation appears to increase HIV vir al shedding and the vir al load in genital secretions. STD TransmissionSTDs are tr ansmitted in the same w ay that HIV is tr ansmitted: b y anal, v aginal, and or al sex. In addition, skin-to-skin contact is important for the tr ansmission of herpes, genital warts, and HPV infection, syphilis, scabies, and pubic lice. Symptoms of STD In the past there w as a great emphasis on symptoms as indicators of STD infection. Research has changed this. W e now know that 80% of those with chlam ydia, 70% of those with herpes, and a great percentage of those with other STDs ha ve no symptoms but can still spread the infections. Along with prompt testing and treatment for those who do ha ve symptoms, the emphasis in the United States is on screening for infection based on beha vioral risk. P atients cannot assume that their healthcare pro viders do STD testing. In other words, women who are getting a P ap test or y early exam should not just assume that they are also being tested for chlam ydia or an y other STD . Prevention of STD The following steps will help prev ent STD infection: Abstain or be in a mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner . Know that man y STDs ha ve no symptoms. Know that birth control pills and shots do not prev ent infections\u2014 you must use condoms along with other birth control methods. Go with y our sex partner(s) for tests. Avoid douching. Learn the right w ay to use condoms and then use them correctly and consistently every time y ou ha ve sex. Be sure all sex partners are examined and treated if an STD occurs. Change the w ays you ha ve sex so that there is no risk of infection. Learn how to talk about correct use of condoms with all sex partners. Practice the prev ention y ou ha ve learned for HIV and hepatitis. STD TestsAt most sites, new urine tests (urinate in a cup) are a vailable for some STDs. The W estern Blot (blood) test for herpes and h ybrid capture tests for genital w arts ma y also be available. In most places, howev er, cultures, wet preps, and blood dr aws for syphilis remain the standard testing method. It is vital that women get P ap tests, and that both men and women disclose a history of STD during medical workups. STD Treatment Treatment for STDs is based on lab work and clinical diagnosis. T reatments v ary with each disease or syndrome. Because there is dev eloping resistance to medications for some STDs, check the latest CDC treatment guidelines. Hepatitis B a nd HIV Hepatitis is inflammation of the liv er that ma y be caused b y man y things, including viruses. Current viruses include hepatitis A (fecal/or al transmission), B , C, D , and others. Hepatitis B (HBV) is a virus that is tr ansmitted b y the blood and body fluids of an infected person. There are appro ximately 10% of people with HIV co-infected with HBV Transmission of HBV occurs in the same beha viors as becoming infected with HIV , namely unprotected sex and through blood tr ansmission of sharing needles. Prevention of HBV A vaccine to prev ent HBV is a vailable. Hepatitis B v accine is administered intr amuscularly as a three-dose series o ver 6 months. More than 90% of people who tak e the three injections become immune to HBV . Why isn' t everyone v accinated for HBV? The HBV vaccine is relativ ely inexpensiv e for infants and children but more expensiv e for adults (costing about $150 per person). This cost is the lik ely reason that most adults are not vaccinated against HBV . HBV Epidemiology Each y ear tens of thousands of people become infected with HBV in the United States. Of these, about 2% to 6% of adults will become chronically infectious carriers of the virus. There are up to 1.4 million carriers of HBV in the United States. HBV is not tr ansmitted b y: Breastfeeding Sneezing Hugging CoughingSharing eating utensils or drinking glasses Food or w ater Casual contact Risk Factors for HBV Infection Unvaccinated people are at higher risk for getting HBV if they: Share injection needles/syringes and equipment Have sexual intercourse with an infected person or with more than one partner Are a man and ha ve sex with a man Work where they come in contact with blood or body fluids, such as in a healthcare setting, prison, or home for the dev elopmentally disabled Use the personal care items (r azors, toothbrushes) of an infected person Are on kidney dialysis Were born in a part of the world with a high r ate of hepatitis B (China, Southeast Asia, Africa, the P acific Islands, the Middle East, South America, and Alaska) Receive a tattoo or body piercing with equipment contaminated with the blood of someone infected with HBV Progression of HBV The a verage incubation period for HBV is about 12 weeks. P eople are infectious when they are \"hepatitis B surface- antigen positiv e\" (HBsAg), either because they are newly infected or because they are chronic carriers. HBV causes damage to the liv er and other body systems, which can r ange in sev erity from mild, to sev ere, to fatal. Most people reco ver from their HBV infection and do not become carriers. Carriers (about 2%-6% of adults who become infected) ha ve the virus in their body for months, y ears, or for life. They can infect others with HBV through their blood or other body fluid contact. Symptoms of HBV People with HBV ma y feel fine and look health y. Some people who are infected with HBV displa y only mild symptoms, which could include: Loss of appetite Extreme fatigue Abdominal painJaundice (y ellowing of the ey es and skin) Joint pain Malaise Dark urine Nausea or v omiting Skin r ashes Others who are infected with HBV experience more sev ere symptoms and ma y be incapacitated for weeks or months. Long-term complications ma y also occur , and include chronic hepatitis, recurring liv er disease, liv er failure, and cirrhosis (chronic liv er damage). Prevention of HBV A vaccine for HBV has been a vailable since 1982. This v accine is suitable for people of all ages, ev en infants. P eople who ma y be at risk for infection should get v accinated. T o further reduce the risk of or prev ent HBV infection, a person can: Abstain from sexual intercourse and/or injecting drug use Maintain a monogamous relationship with a partner who is uninfected or v accinated against HBV Use safer sex pr actices (as defined in the T ransmission section) Never share needles/syringes or other injection equipment Never share toothbrushes, r azors, nose clippers, or other personal care items that may come in contact with blood Use Standard Precautions with all blood and body fluids Infants born to mothers who are HBV carriers ha ve a greater than 90% reduction in their chance of becoming infected with HBV , if they receiv e a shot of hepatitis B immune globulin and hepatitis B v accine shortly after birth, plus two additional v accine doses b y age 6 months. It is vital that the women and their medical pro viders are a ware that the woman is an HBV carrier . People with HBV should not donate blood, semen, or body organs. Treatment of HBV There are no medications a vailable for recently acquired (acute) HBV infection. There are antivir al drugs a vailable for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, howev er treatment success v aries b y individual. The v accine is not used to treat HBV once a person is infected. Hepatitis C and HIVHepatitis C is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is found in the blood of people who have this disease. Hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. Hepatitis C was discovered in the late 1980s, although it was likely spread for at least 40 to 50 years prior to that. HCV Epidemiology Globally, 180 million people are infected with HCV. An estimated 4.1 million Americans have been infected with HCV and about 3.2 million are chronically infected (meaning they have a current or previous infection with the virus). The CDC estimates that as many as 1 million Americans were infected with HCV from blood transfusions, and that 3.75 million Americans do not know they are HCV-positive. Of these, 2.75 million people are chronically infected and are infectious for HCV. In the United States, 8,000 to 10,000 deaths per year are attributed to HCV-associated liver disease. The number of deaths from HCV is expected to triple in the next 10 to 20 years. Transmission of HCV HCV is transmitted primarily by blood and blood products. Blood transfusions before 1992 and the use of shared or unsterilized needles and syringes have been the main causes of the spread of HCV in the United States. The primary way that HCV is transmitted now is through injecting drug use. Since 1992 all blood for donation in the United States is tested for HCV. Sexual transmission of HCV is considered low, but it accounts for 10% to 20% of infections. If a pregnant woman is infected with HCV, she may pass the virus to her baby, but this occurs in only about 5% of those pregnancies. Household tr ansmission is possible if people share personal care items such as razors, nail clippers, or toothbrushes. HCV is not transmitted by: Breastfeeding (unless blood is present) Sneezing Hugging Kissing Coughing Sharing eating utensils or drinking glasses Food or waterCasual contact Progression of HCV The sev erity of HCV differs from HIV . The CDC states that, for ev ery hundred people who are infected with HCV : About 15% will fully reco ver and ha ve no liv er damage 85% ma y dev elop long-term chronic infection 70% ma y dev elop chronic liv er disease 20% ma y dev elop cirrhosis o ver a period of 20-30 y ears 1%-5% ma y die from chronic liv er disease Symptoms of HCV People with HCV ma y have few or no symptoms for decades. When present, the symptoms of HCV are: Nausea and v omiting Weakness Fever Muscle and joint pain Jaundice (y ellowing of the ey es and skin) Dark-colored urine Tenderness in the upper abdomen Prevention of HCV There is no v accine to prev ent HCV infection. P eople with HCV should not donate blood, semen, or body organs. The following steps can protect against HCV infection: Follow Standard Precautions to a void contact with blood or accidental needlesticks. Refrain from acquiring tattoos or skin piercings outside of a legitimate business that practices Univ ersal Precautions. Refrain from an y type of injecting drug use or drug equipment sharing. Never share toothbrushes, r azors, nail clippers, or other personal care items. Cover cuts or sores on the skin.People who are HCV -infected ma y lower the small risk of passing HCV to their sex partner b y using latex condoms and pr acticing safer sex. Women who are HCV -infected and wish to ha ve children should discuss their choices beforehand with a medical specialist. Treatment of HCV Currently there are appro ved antiretro viral treatments for HCV . The cost of the treatments can be high, and the side effects can be significant (fatigue, flu-lik e symptoms, nausea, depression, and anemia). P eople infected with HCV should abstain from alcohol use to avoid further damage to the liv er. Testing for HCV Many people who are infected with HCV are una ware of their status. P eople who should consider testing are: Current or former injecting drug users People who receiv ed blood tr ansfusions or an organ tr ansplant prior to 1992 Hemophiliacs who receiv ed clotting factor concentr ates produced before 1987 People who receiv ed chronic hemodialysis Infants born to infected mothers Healthcare work ers who ha ve been occupationally exposed to blood or who ha ve had accidental needlesticks People who are sex partners of people with HCV Testing for HCV is a vailable through ph ysicians and some health departments. In 1999 the Food and Drug Administr ation appro ved the first home test for HCV . The test kit, called Hepatitis C Check , is available from the Home Access Health Compan y. The test is accur ate if it has been at least 6 months since the possible exposure to HCV . HIV/HCV Co-Infection Many people who become infected with HIV from injecting drug use are already infected with HCV . Some estimate that 40% of HIV -infected people in the United States are also infected with HCV . People who are co-infected with both viruses and ha ve immune system impairment ma y progress faster to serious, chronic, or fatal liv er damage. Most new HCV infections in the United States are among injecting drug users. The majorit y of hemophiliacs who receiv ed blood products contaminated with HIV also are infected with HCV.Treating HIV in someone with HCV may be complicated because many of the medicines that are used to treat HIV may damage the liver; however, treatment for co-infection is possible in some cases with close physician supervision.

In the case of HIV or AIDS, reportable means that providers who diagnose a person must submit a confidential case report to the local health jurisdiction within 3 days.HIV and AIDS Are Reportable Conditions Reporting of HIV and AIDS cases assists local and state officials in tr acking the epidemic. It also allows for effectiv e planning and interv ention to be pro vided in the effort to reduce the transmission of HIV to other people. Anonymous Tests and Reporting Positiv e HIV results obtained through anon ymous testing are not reportable. Howev er, once a patient with positiv e results seeks medical care for conditions related to HIV or AIDS , the provider is required to report the case to the local health department. Spousal Notification Federal Public La w 104-146 (1996) requires that states tak e action to require that a \"good faith effort \" be made to notif y all spouses of HIV -infected people. A spouse is defined as anyone who is or has been the marriage partner of an HIV -infected individual within 10 years prior to the HIV diagnosis. Notification means that individuals testing positiv e will be counseled about the importance of notif ying spouses and partners and will be giv en the choice to notif y, to allow the healthcare pro vider to notif y, or to refer to the local health jurisdiction for assistance in notifying the spouse. Confidentiality All medical records are confidential and must be maintained in a manner that protects that confidentialit y. Confidentiality of medical information means that a person' s medical information (including HIV testing and HIV results) ma y not be disclosed to an yone unless the individual signs a release-of -information form. Howev er, there are ex ceptions to this. Medical information can be disclosed under certain circumstances, including: When it is giv en from one healthcare pro vider to another healthcare pro vider for related ongoing medical care of the patient In a life or death emergency To a third-part y payer (insur ance pro vider) In reporting notifiable conditions to the local health jurisdiction or the Department of Health (DOH) Violation of the abo ve-mentioned la ws is a misdemeanor and ma y result in civil liabilit y actions for reckless or intentional disclosure up to $10,000 or actual damages, whichev er is greater . It is the responsibilit y of the count y's health officer to in vestigate potential breaches of confidentialit y of HIV identif ying information and report them to the DOH.Additional Confidentiality Protections Some areas of the medical record ha ve additional confidentialit y requirements because disclosure of the information to the wrong person or agency could mean additional harm to the patient. It has been determined that there exists a lev el of prejudice, fear , and discrimination directed at people with these medical conditions. Therefore, there is a legal balance between civil protection and information access. Disability and Discrimination People with AIDS and HIV are also protected b y feder al law under Title II of the Americans with Disabilit y Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the F ederal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended. P eople with HIV infection and/or AIDS who feel discriminated against on the basis of their disease ma y file a complaint with the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) of the U .S. Department of Health and Human Services, or their own state rights commission. Disability Federal and state jurisdictions differ in approaches to disabilit y. They do not necessarily cover all emplo yers. State la ws must be reviewed for state-specific mandates. Discr imination-Free Environment Emplo yers are required to pro vide and maintain a working en vironment free of discrimination. They must assure that no har assment, intimidation, or adv erse action or personnel distinction is made in terms and conditions of emplo yment based on HIV status. If a worksite situation dev elops that poses the threat of discrimination, it is best pr actice for the emplo yer to pro vide education and supervision to emplo yees in order to end harassment, the use of slurs, or intimidation. An emplo yer should promptly in vestigate allegations of discrimination, tak e appropriate action, and not retaliate against the person who complained. If someone is in a situation in which they feel they are being discriminated against, they should first document the discrimination, speak with their supervisor , and follow the entity's internal process to file a discrimination charge. Howev er, it is not necessary to follow an internal griev ance process. If these remedies do not work, a person should contact the Office for Civil Rights within their own state. An aggriev ed person can also file directly in state court. A complaint must be filed within 180 da ys of the alleged discriminatory incident. Reasonable Acco mmodationEmplo yers are responsible for pro viding reasonable worksite accommodations that will enable a qualified disabled emplo yee or job applicant to perform the essential tasks of the particular job . Reasonable accommodation means modifications to a worksite or job , in the context of the entire emplo yer's oper ation, such as: Providing special equipment Altering the work en vironment Allowing flex -time Providing frequent rest breaks Allowing the person to work at home (telecommute) Restructuring the job An emplo yee with a disabilit y must self -identif y and request a reasonable accommodation. The emplo yer must engage in an inter active process with the requestor . The reasonable accommodation gr ant ma y not be exactly the same one as requested b y the emplo yee, but one that is equally effectiv e. The emplo yer does not ha ve to change the essential nature of its work, or engage in undue hardship or hea vy administr ative burdens. The essential functions of the job must be accomplished, with or without reasonable accommodations. Potentially Prejudicial Information When a person goes for a job interview or is hired, it is best pr actice for an emplo yer to refrain from asking questions directed at the perception or presence of HIV infection or AIDS unless the emplo yer has obtained a \"bona fide occupational qualification\" (BFOQ) from their state. It is best pr actice for an emplo yer to refr ain from asking \"lifest yle\" questions, such as inquiring about an applicant 's religion, living arr angements, sexual orientation, or gender identit y. Exceptions to the abo ve include people applying for U .S. citiz enship under feder al law, which supersedes state la w. Behaviors Endangering the Public Health Health Officer s The local health officer is the ph ysician hired to direct the oper ations of the local count y's health department or health district. Included in the broad responsibilities of the health officer is the authorit y to: Interview people infected with an STDNotify sexual or needle-sharing partners of exposure to disease Order people suspected of being infected to receiv e examination, testing, counseling, or treatment Issue orders to cease and desist from specific conduct that endangers the public health of others Court enforcement of these orders can be sought. State la w delineates the standards that must be met before action b y the health officer ma y be tak en. Reporting Non-Compliance Healthcare pro viders are required to pro vide instruction on infection control measures to the patient who is diagnosed with a communicable disease. They are also required to report certain information to the local health officer where there are either impediments to or refusal to comply with prescribed infection control measures. When a healthcare pro vider has knowledge that a specific patient is failing to comply with prescribed infection control measures (acquisition of a new STD , sex without disclosure of HIV status to sexual partners, failure to disclose HIV status to needle-sharing partners, donating or selling HIV -infected blood), they should contact the local public health officer to discuss the circumstances of the case and to determine whether the name of the person should be reported for in vestigation and followup . Case Investigation The health officer or other authoriz ed representativ e will in vestigate the case if credible evidence exists that an HIV -infected person is engaging in conduct endangering the public health. Other la ws and regulations concern endangering beha viors as well as occupational exposures. These ma y be specific to professions and to the jurisdictions of public health officers.

Ev en with the adv ent of antiretro viral (ARV) drugs, people with AIDS still die prematurely . Men who ha ve sex with men and injecting drug users\u2014 who ma y already be stigmatiz ed and subjected to social and job-related discrimination\u2014ma y encounter ev en more societal pressure and stress with a diagnosis of HIV or AIDS . Ninet y percent of all adults with AIDS are in the prime of life and ma y not be prepared to deal with death and dying. The infections and malignancies that accompan y AIDS\u2014 along with certain medications\u2014can diminish and disfigure the body . People who are living with HIV face the need to pr actice \"safer sex\" and tak e medications for the remainder of their lives. One thing that char acteriz es the grief around AIDS is the repetition of deaths that one person ma y experience. Man y people working with or living with AIDS for y ears ha ve gone to countless funer als and ha ve seen a succession of their friends pass a way. This is sometimes termed chronic grief . Chronic grief intensifies when an individual realiz es that before the grieving process for one death is complete man y more people ma y have died, compounding the grieving process.True A. False B.

Grief can manifest itself in ph ysical symptoms, including clinical depression, h ypochondria, anxiet y, insomnia, and the inabilit y to get pleasure from normal daily activities. Dealing with these issues ma y lead to self -destructiv e beha viors such as alcohol or drug abuse. Disbelief , numbness, and inabilit y to face facts occur for some. The fear of the unknown, the onset of infections, swollen lymph nodes, and loss of weight (or unusual weight gain) can be accompanied b y fear of dev eloping AIDS , or of getting sick er. People infected with HIV/AIDS are often rejected b y family , friends, or co- workers. In some cases, guilt develops about the disease, about past beha viors, or about the possibilit y of ha ving unwittingly infected someone else. People living with HIV ma y feel as though their \"normal\" liv es ha ve completely ended as they must plan detailed medication schedules and medical appointments. The cost of the medications for HIV ma y result in financial hardship , even if the person has medical coverage.Sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, withdr awal, and isolation are often present. Anger is common: at the virus, at the effects of the medications or the failure of some of the medications, at the prospect of illness or death, and at the discrimination often encountered. Some people with HIV consider suicide or attempt suicide, and some ma y actually kill themselv es. Call the crisis hotline listed in y our phone book, or call the National Suicide Prev ention Lifeline at 800 273 8255 (273 T ALK) or the National Hopeline Network at 800 784 2433 (800 SUICIDE). Stages of Grief Grief has been described in a v ariety of forms. It ma y be best understood as a process that doesn' t follow a str aight line. P eople do not mo ve predictably step-b y-step through the various stages of their grieving, but progress at their own speed. There seem to be discreet phases of grief , including: Shock and numbing Yearning and searching Disorganization and despair Some degree of reorganization The length of time it tak es to mo ve between these stages is determined b y individuals and their v alues and cultur al norms. In uncomplicated grief , an individual is able to mo ve through these stages and come out of the grieving process. Complicated grief is described as an exagger ation or distortion of the normal process of grieving. P eople experiencing multiple losses are more at risk for complications. If an individual has been impacted b y multiple deaths, it ma y be difficult to reorganiz e and mo ve on with the process. Caregiver Issues Often feelings experienced b y the caregiv er will mirror those of the patient; these can include a sense of vulner ability and helplessness. Caregiv ers ma y experience the same isolation as the person with HIV infection. Finding a support system, including a qualified counselor , can be just as important for the caregiv er as for the person who has HIV disease. Support from co- workers can be especially important. Caregiv ers ma y find it necessary to acknowledge their own experiences and feelings when dealing with all aspects of this disease. Good self -care for the caregiv er is important. There are other issues for people who share a home with, or pro vide home care for , people with HIV or AIDS .Things to Do Do meet with a support person, group , or counselor on a regular basis to discuss y our experiences and feelings. Do set limits in caregiving time and responsibilit y and stick to those limits. Do allow y ourself to ha ve questions. Let \"not knowing\" be OK. Do get the information and support y ou deserv e and need. Do discuss with y our emplo yer ways to reduce stress and burnout. Do remember that Standard Precautions are for the patient 's health and welfare, as well as y our own. Things to A void Don't isolate y ourself . Don't try to be all things to all people. Don't expect to ha ve all the answers. Don't deny your own fears about AIDS or dying. Don't continue to work in an area where y ou can' t cope. Don't dismiss Standard Precautions because y ou know the patient. Special Populations Although HIV infection affects people from all ethnic groups, genders, ages, and income levels, some groups ha ve been significantly affected b y the AIDS epidemic. These groups include men who ha ve sex with men, injecting drug users, people with hemophilia, women, transgender people, and people of color . The following information details how these different populations ma y be uniquely affected b y the AIDS epidemic. Men Who Have Sex w ith Men American societ y has issues with homosexualit y. Grief ma y not be v alidated when relationships are viewed through prejudice and considered unacceptable. An example of this ma y be the reaction of churches to those who are living with, or ha ve families living with, AIDS . Man y congregants report that they do not get the support they need from their church families because of the stigma attached to HIV , AIDS , and homosexualit y. Self- esteem issues and psy chological issues, including depression, anxiet y, diagnosed mental illness and risk -taking beha viors, ma y also complicate the liv es of these men.Additionally , there are the issues with HIV -negativ e men who ha ve sex with men. Most of the attention, resources, and services are focused on HIV -positiv e gay men. As with an y behavior change, people can become \"tired\" of safer sex messages and ma y mak e choices that place them at risk. Some ma y feel that HIV infection is inevitable (although it is not) and purposely engage in unprotected sex. Men who ha ve sex with both men and women (who do not ex clusiv ely self -identif y as ga y) face additional challenges. It is more difficult to reach men who do not identif y as being gay with HIV prev ention efforts and activities. Bisexual men face the same challenges as gay men do but ma y not ha ve the social and communit y resources they need. Women Who Have Sex with Women Women who ha ve sex with women, regardless of whether they self -identif y as lesbian or bisexual, are at potentially greater risk than monogamous heterosexual women through their possible use of fingering, or al sex, and sex to ys. The risk is lower than women who have sex with infected men because less bodily fluid is ex changed between women. Safer sex guidelines still apply , including a voiding an y body fluid ex change through v aginal secretions, breast milk, or blood. It is important to a void or al sex if either partner has mouth sores or cuts. Heterosexu al Transgender Women These women ha ve very specific risks because societ y at large is only now becoming a ware of them. When their declar ation of tr ansgender is made, they often lose their family support system. T ransgender women often face emplo yment and insur ance discrimination, and the cascade of rejections can lead to a higher lik elihood of doing sex work (Oper ario, 2008). Until now there w as a tendency to include these women in the category of \"men who ha ve sex with men, \" which is not only inaccur ate but also hides the particular reasons they are at higher risk. Injecting Drug Users American societ y also has issues with illegal drug use and with marginaliz ed individuals such as those in po verty and the homeless. P eople who continue to use injecting drugs, despite w arnings and information about risks, ma y incur additional problems b y being viewed b y some as \"deserving\" their infection. Harm reduction measures such as syringe ex change progr ams, ha ve been pro ven to reduce the tr ansmission of bloodborne pathogens lik because some people believ e that pro viding clean needles and a place to exchange used needles constitutes \"appro val\" of injection drug use.In addition, po verty, self-esteem issues, and psy chological issues (including depression, anxiet y, diagnosed mental illness, and risk -taking beha viors) ma y also complicate the liv es of injecting drug users. The desire to stop using illegal drugs ma y be v ery far apart from the abilit y to stop . The realit y about inpatient treatment facilities is that while there is a large demand for spaces v ery few are a vailable. Man y substance abusers are placed on waiting lists when they w ant treatment, and b y the time there is a place for them their contact information ma y be lost, prev enting followup . People with Hem ophilia Hemophiliacs lack the abilit y to produce certain blood clotting factors. Before the adv ent of anti-hemophilic factor concentr ates (\"factor VIII\" or \"factor IX, \" clotting material pooled out of donated blood plasma), hemophiliacs could bleed to death. These concentr ates allowed hemophiliacs to receiv e injections of the clotting factors that they lack ed, which in turn allowed them to lead relativ ely normal liv es. Unfortunately , because the r aw materials for these concentr ates came from donated blood, many hemophiliacs were infected with HIV prior to the adv ent of blood testing. During the 1980s, 90% of sev ere hemophiliacs contr acted HIV or HCV through use of these products. There is anger within this communit y because evidence shows that the companies manufacturing the concentr ates knew their products might be contaminated but continued to distribute them an yway. Some people considered hemophiliacs to be innocent victims of HIV , but there has been discrimination against them. The R yan White Care Act, funding HIV services, and the Ricky Ray Act, which pro vides compensation to hemophiliacs infected with HIV , were both named after HIV -positiv e hemophiliacs who suffered significant discrimination such as arson and refusal of admittance to gr ade school in their home towns. Women with HIV In the United States, 1 in 4 people living with HIV are women, with highest prev alence 61% among Black/African American women and 17% Hispanic/Latina women. Eight -seven percent of these women were infected through heterosexual sex and 13% injection drug use. W omen in the United States and worldwide are becoming infected with HIV at higher rates than an y other group of people. This is particularly true of women of color . Women who are infected with HIV , or who ha ve family members who ha ve HIV , face some unique challenges.Women ma y become infected with HIV from a partner who either used injecting drugs or had other sexual partners. These women ma y have assumed that the relationship w as monogamous, or that they \"knew\" their partner 's history . Man y others are unable to discuss or implement safer sex pr actices because they lack the skills or because domestic violence is present in their relationship . Women ma y postpone taking medication, or going to medical appointments, in order to care for their children or other family members. W omen (and also men) ma y hesitate to disclose their HIV status to others, fearing loss of their jobs, or housing, or other forms of discrimination. Single parents with HIV ma y be particularly fearful because of their lack of support. Many women ha ve problems with lack of tr ansportation, lack of health insur ance, limited education, and low income. They ma y have childcare problems that prev ent them from going to medical appointments. Many women who are infected with HIV do not consider this to be their worst problem. Their symptoms ma y be mild and manageable for man y years. Mean while, they ma y have more pressing concerns, such as their lack of income, housing, access to medical care, possible abusiv e relationships, and concerns about their children. State and CDC efforts are working tow ards state allocated funds, communit y-based organizations to serv e as local resources, and campaigns to promote a wareness and prev ention beha viors. Answer: DTest Your Learning The group with the highest r ate of new HIV infection in the United States and worldwide is: People of ColorHispanic childrenA. Gay men B. American IndiansC. Women D.African Americans and Hispanics ha ve disproportionately higher r ates of AIDS in the United States, despite the fact that there are no biological reasons for the disparities, suggesting lifestyle beha viors determine the increased risk. African American and Hispanic women make up less than 25% of the total U .S. population, but account for 77% of all reported AIDS cases in women. African Americans mak e up about 12% of the population, but account for 37% of all AIDS cases in the United States. Hispanics mak e up about 13% of the population, but account for 20% of the AIDS cases in the United States. In some areas, disparities also exist in the number of AIDS cases in Nativ e Americans. There is no single reason that stands out as to wh y the disparities exist. One factor is health disparities, which are link ed to socioeconomic conditions. Another factor is distrust of the healthcare system based on low educational lev el and cultur al prejudices. Current issues of r ace mean that man y people of color do not trust \"the system\" for a v ariety of reasons. Thus, ev en when income is not a barrier , access to early interv ention and treatment ma y be limited. HIV ma y be only one of a list of problems that also includes adequate housing, food, and emplo yment. Another factor ma y be the div ersities within these populations. Div ersity is evident in immigr ant status, religion, languages, and geogr aphic locations, as well as socioeconomic conditions. Pro viding targeted information to these div erse populations is challenging. A significant amount of denial about HIV risk continues to exist in these communities. As with other groups, there ma y also be fear and stigmatization of those who ha ve HIV . Prevention messages must be tailored and presented in a cultur ally and linguistically appropriate manner . The messages must be carried through channels that are appropriate for the individual communit y. These channels ma y include religious institutions or respected leaders in the communit y. Ironically , it ma y be these institutions or leaders who , in the past, ha ve contributed to the misinformation and stigma associated with HIV . Many HIV prev ention progr ams are recognizing the importance of working with div erse communities. Input from these communities must be included in planning, deliv ering, and evaluating HIV prev ention activities. Children with HIVThe major cause of HIV in children under age 13 has been mother -to-child tr ansmission during pregnancy , childbirth, or breastfeeding. T esting newborns for antibodies is ineffectiv e because the maternal antibodies remain in the infant 's system for up to 18 months. Childhood deaths are related to opportunistic infections and up to 20% of children will acquire an opportunistic infection during their first y ear of life. Simple infections such as colds, fev er, diarrhea, deh ydration, and fungal infections from diaper r ash can dev elop into more sev ere infections and longer hospital sta ys.
