Essential oils can quickly uplift you; calm and relax you; enliven, motivate, and inspire you; harmonize and balance your emotions; and help improve many basic physical and psychological functions. In this article, you'll learn why the quality of essential oils is so important, how to use them, and specific oil blends to balance the doshas. An ancient tradition Healing scents have been used in the Ayurvedic tradition for millennia\u2014from [sandalwood incense](https://www.mapi.com/products/incense-suraj-sandalwood) lit during meditation to holy basil infused water sprinkled indoors for purification. Vaidyas\u2014Ayurvedic physicians\u2014treated Indian royalty with dried and fresh herbs, floral waters, and aromatherapy oil massage. Ayurveda considers the use of aroma as an important tool for prevention and healing; practitioners use it for protecting the vital force, prana; regulating digestion and metabolism, agni; and increasing resistance to disease, ojas. Ayurvedic essential oils [Essential oils](https://mapi.com/blogs/articles/ayurvedic-aromatherapy-how-to-use-essential-oils) are highly concentrated essences of aromatic plants. They can be derived from all parts of the plant: flowers (rose), woods (sandalwood), barks (cinnamon), leaves (basil), roots (licorice), and fruits (orange). The methods of oil extraction are time consuming and expensive, and require a high degree of expertise. Some essential oils are especially costly due to the labor intensive process and the quantity of the plant required to produce the oil. For example, approximately 2,000 kilograms of rose petals would produce one kilogram of essential oil, and four million jasmine flowers produce a kilogram of jasmine oil! However, they are also highly potent\u2014only a few drops are required to achieve the desired effect. Essential oils can be used alone or in combination. At Maharishi AyurVeda, we mix our aromas into synergistic blends to increase their potency and to balance the effect of individual oils. A synergistic blend of healing substances delivers a holistic benefit that is greater than the sum of its parts. Furthermore, careful balancing of ingredients is reported to counteract possible side effects from a single substance. Quality and method of distillation are important The effectiveness of essential oils employed for therapeutic use depends on the purity of the oils. When essential oils are completely pure\u2014produced without the use of chemicals and synthetic products\u2014the aroma and health benefits are greatly enhanced. Highest quality is assured when oils are produced according to stringent standards. These kinds of pure oils have been difficult to obtain for a number of reasons, even though the demand for quality essential oils is growing. Producing 100% pure essential oils requires more time and focus and involves greater risks, so it's done by only a few small family enterprises. The distillation process is also crucial to the quality of the oils. Many modern methods distill the oils too quickly using high pressure and high temperature, causing many of the rare, precious elements to be lost. On the contrary, slow distillation at lower temperatures ensures the maximum retention of active components in the oils, which contributes to their special aromatic and therapeutic effect. Our [essential oils](https://www.mapi.com/collections/essential-oils) are 100% pure; derived from plants that are grown without the use of chemical fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, or fungicides; and they are distilled slowly and under low pressure to ensure maximum retention of active components. How to use essential oils Diffuse When we smell essential oils, the vapor stimulates our olfactory nerve. This is the only nerve in the body that directly contacts the environment and goes all the way to the brain. The olfactory nerve stimulates the limbic system, which is connected to the areas of the brain that process emotions, desires, appetites, and memories, as well as the endocrine glands which regulate hormone levels in the body. For this reason, aromas have a subtle but very powerful influence on our mind and body. Scents of vanilla, orange blossom, rose, chamomile, and lavender have a noticeably calming effect. Lavender, sandalwood, and nutmeg oils also help to reduce stress. Patchouli oil helps reduce worry, lifts the mood, and increases bliss. Try our therapeutic aroma blends: Put them in a room or car [diffuser](https://www.mapi.com/products/aroma-diffuser) to cleanse and purify the air, or wear them in an aroma locket to relax, uplift your mood, or improve your sleep. Massage Aromatherapy massage is another widely used Ayurvedic technique. During a massage, you inhale the essential oils and your skin absorbs them as well. They penetrate the tissues and find their way into your bloodstream, where they are transported to the organs and systems of the body. Essential oils have different rates of absorption, so it's best not to shower directly following a massage to ensure maximum effectiveness. To balance your dosha or to adjust to the seasons, try our [Moisturizing](https://www.mapi.com/products/calming-vata-aroma-oil), [Soothing](https://www.mapi.com/products/cooling-pitta-aroma-oil), or [Stimulating](https://www.mapi.com/products/stimulating-kapha-aroma-oil) aroma massage oils. Our [Youthful Skin Massage Oils](https://www.mapi.com/products/youthful-skin-massage-oil-for-women-net-4-fl-oz-118-ml) are also rich in aromas and balance all the three doshas. Bath Aromatic baths are also popular forms of aromatherapy. The large surface of the warm water in the tub instantly vaporizes the essential oils, sending their particles to your brain. Soaking alone relaxes your muscles and your whole physiology, so you enhance the effect of the aromas. Add bath salts right before you enter the tub to enjoy the full potency of their essential oils. You may also apply essential oils topically post-bath, but be sure to dilute them with a good quality carrier oil first before applying to your skin. The standard dilution is 20-40 drops essential oil to 2 ounces of a carrier oil. Skin and hair care Unlike many personal care items scented with synthetic aromas, our body care formulas use only pure essential oils. The smell of botanicals like roses, jasmine, or neem in soaps can enliven your shower. [Organic Rose Water](https://www.mapi.com/products/organic-rose-water) helps tone your skin and uplift your spirit. The aromas in our [Youthful Skin Cream](https://www.mapi.com/products/youthful-skin-cream) relax your entire physiology when you apply it to your skin. They also get absorbed in your bloodstream through your skin. For this reason, whatever bodycare products you use, make sure they contain only natural essential oils and ingredients. Artificial aromas and perfumes will not provide the same benefits and can cause skin irritation or allergic reactions. Supporting the immune system Essential oils are ideal for aiding immunity during the cold winter months when your physiology is more susceptible to getting a cold or flu. Virtually all pure essential oils have bactericidal and anti-microbial properties, which offer support to the immune system. To support your respiratory system, try [Clear Breathe](https://www.mapi.com/products/clear-breathe). [Sniffle Free Aroma Oil](https://www.mapi.com/products/sniffle-free-aroma-oil) is also useful for opening up the nasal passages for easier breathing. Household hygiene Add a few drops of an antibacterial essential oil such as lemon, tea tree, or lavender to your cleaning liquid when washing down kitchen counters, door handles, and bathroom fixtures. You can make a spray with 10-20 drops of your favorite oil(s) to an 8-oz. mister bottle filled with distilled water. Shake well before use. Travel support Carry a handkerchief, cotton ball, or tissue soaked with drops of an essential oil and inhale occasionally while traveling. This is particularly useful in public transport, where the air may not be very fresh. Note: Essential oils are potent substances\u2014less is more with many of these oils. Exercise care in both blending and use. Test for sensitivity and always dilute oils before bringing them in contact with your skin. If you are pregnant, please consult your physician before using any essential oils. These oils are for external use only.
