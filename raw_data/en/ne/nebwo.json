I want to particularly thank the women for their trust, honesty and openness in talking about a passage of their lives which for many, was difficult and filled with much anguish. The enthusiasm and willingness to participate of all those who contributed to this study has not only made this project possible, but it provided me with the encouragement and reassurance that this was a worthwhile pursuit. I am also grateful to the support staff of the clinics and hospitals who guided me through the often complex protocols and procedures which enabled my authorised entry into this world. To Anni Dugdale, my supervisor, I offer my deepest gratitude for allowing me the independence to engage with this work, and yet, providing me with sufficient guidance to enable me to weave my way through this motley discipline . I have greatly benefited from Anni's insight, constructive critiques and for stretching me intellectually to what often seemed beyond capacity. Moreover , I am grateful for Anni's constant encouragement, confidence in me and making me feel like a respected colleahTUe from our first meeting. r am also grateful for the financial support provided through the Australian Postgraduate Award Scheme which made this project a possibility. I wish to also thank the History and Philosophy of Science Department for their continued assistance and support during the period of my candidature . I offer my thanks to Sarah Russell for her support over the period of this study, her careful readings and provision of necessary distractions .

Debates rage about the medicalisation of an otherwise normal life event and the use ofHRT, particularly the association ofHRT with increased risks of cancer, as well as its use in the long term prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease. Feminists have made significant and worthwhile contributions towards addressing these and related issues, as well as opening up these debates to public scrutiny. Within this controversial forum., one particular understanding of menopause has gained prominence, namely the notion of menopause as a disease of deficient hormones. The focus of this thesis is on how this particular concept of menopause has come to be stabilised as 'fact'. 1 argue that this understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency is a socio-material construction, and as such, is only one of many possible constructions of menopause. Given these possibilities, how then has this particular understanding come to be so prevalent, not just in medical practice but in everyday life? To examine this question, I employ a feminist interactionist science studies approach which focuses on how knowledge is generated through the standardisation of social\u00ad material practices. This approach combines (i) science studies, in particular actor network theory, (ii) symbolic interactionism, emphasising interactionist studies which bridge the gap between science studies and symbolic interactionism , and (iii) feminist critiques of medicine, science and technolob'Y . I situate my exploration in menopause clinics -specialised , largely medical sites where women's menopausal problems are managed and treated. The menopause clinic brings together many disparate collectives . including gynaecologists, endocrinologists , physicians and psychologists each providing different fonns of specialised management , as well as material technologies such as bone densitometry , HRT, mammography and ultrasound. vm My focus is on the every day practices of the menopause clinic which both maintain the very existence of the clinics and are vital to the production of knowledge about menopause. Several key practices offhe clinic are exarnin.ed to show how the particular understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency is constructed and generated through the working of these practices. Focussing on these social-material practices and interactions reveals how this particular understanding of menopause is shaped and stabilised. In tracing the stabilisation of the menopause clinic and its concomitant understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency, 1 argue that despite its seemingly stable facade, the menopause arena is fraught with ambiguities and contradictions . Positioning my focus at the level ofpractiees reveals that many of the clime's practices are simultaneously complieit and resisting. I follow these inteffiJptions to the clinic's network of relations and trace how they offer potential disruptions to the current orderings of the clinic and the prevalent understanding of menopause as honnone deficiency . Directing attention to how particular knowledge claims come about makes visible other possible outcomes, thus opening up potential reconstructions of current knowledge claims about menopause . DECLARATION The text of this thesis is less then 100,000 words in length, exclusive of tables, bibliographies , appendices and footnotes. Marilys 1 -Introduction should be regarded as a sex.linked, female\u00b7 dominant, endocrine deficiency disease, with specific symptoms and signs, which should be investigated and managed in a very careful and considered fashion for the remainder of the woman's life. (Wren, 1985, p. S3) The menopause should be defined as the pennanent cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian follicular activity. (Khaw, 1992, p. 250) Riddled in scientific parlance, these quotes typiry the 'official' account of menopause as a hormone deficiency disease requiring appropriate therapeutic management. In neat algorithmic steps, this account sets up menopause as a problem -a problem of honnone deficiency and hormone replacement therapy (HRT) I is constructed as the clever solution to this problem. Categorised as a disease state, menopause in this account, is reduced to a set of specific symptoms requiring investigation and therapy. This sanitised problem/solution account of menopause is straight forward, neat and seamless . (njuxtaposition to this tidy, seamless account of menopause as hormone deficiency, picture a group offour women meeting for the first time one evening to hear of the findings of a study in which they had recently participated . The women range in age from 47 to 51 years, have different and varied occupations, lifestyles, levels of education, and are present on this evening for very different reasons. Elaine2 faces difficult, complex and interrelated physiological problems stemming , she says, from her body's inability to adequately absorb and eliminate hormones. Elaine has been on HRT for many years, having tried oral therapy, patches and implants in various combinations and dosages. Her problems have worsened in the fast 10 years. Elaine describes menopause as a chronic iI/ness, a result of I Although I usc HRT here as a generic term. in subsequent chapters I differentiate between oestrogen therapy and combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy. 2 It was a requirement of the ethics committees wh..ich approved this study to replace the names of all participants with pseudonyms . 2 Ch. I: Introduction hormonal imbalance , which rules her life. Elaine sees menopause as a dark funnel through which she is travelling . She oscillates between seeing black clouds ahead of her and seeing a light, albeit a dim one, at the end of the tunnel through which she hopes she will emerge. Elaine is reticent about revealing too much; she is hoping to find someone else whose experiences are as severe as hers, to whom she can relate, who she says can really understand what she is going through. Anna is having a difficult time and has recently separated from her second husband. This is compounded by bouts of severe depression and confusion which have persisted for the last 2-3 years. Anna's life consists of major ups and downs. During the down times, Anna feels out of confrol- hormonally , emotionally and subjectively . Anna is trying to regain control through the management she seeks at the menopause clinic. The clinic, she says, is her lifeline, a place where you don't have to embroider the details of your life to get someone to listen. Anna is not on HRT. She is adamant that menopause is a normal life phase and feels that she should be able to get through it without relying on medication . Anna and Elaine discuss which is worse in menopause -the hormonal or the emotional problems , each contributing from their individual banks of experience . Anna has come to this evening's session to seek support and comfort from other women sharing their experiences. Talking to women friends is her main source of support and on this evening, as at the clinic, she eagerly seeks counsel. Wendy is reserved and quiet; she appears frail and delicate. Wendy has a family history of osteoporoSiS and is afraid that she too may have osteoporosis . When she reached her late 40s Wendy decided if was time to act. Wendy has been on HRT for 3 years to prevent osteoporosis . She has occasional hot flushes but is not concerned about these. It is osteoporoSiS that is her concern and she will do all she can to prevent any bone loss. For Wendy, menopause is a normal part of life. OsteoporoSiS , however, is a disease and through its association with menopause and oestrogen loss, requires hormonal treatment . Wendy takes responsibility for her own health because, as she asks, who else will? Wendy seeks out as much information on osteoporoSiS as possible. She is unaccustomed to sharing her feelings with other women, yet is surprised to find herself falking about how she feels as she attempts to find out more information through the experiences of the other women present. 3 Ch. 1: Introduction Rhonda has been having problems for 8 years. At first she was able to manage her hot flushes, irregular periods and night sweats. Compounded by a difficult mam\"age break up, she felt Jess able to cope and sought help. She was uncertain whether her problems were related to menopause or her disturbed emotional state. Rhonda was prescribed HRT for her problems. Subsequenlly, she began to bleed heavily and suffer other side effects from HRT. It reached the stage where she thought that her hot flushes were easier to cope with than these unwanted side effects and she decided to cease laking HRT. Rhonda thinks that menopause is a very individual process with some women sailing through it, and others experiencing serious problems. Rhonda enthusiastically joins in the discussion, eager to find out about other avenues available for managing her menopause. The accounts of these four women is messy. complex and riddled with uncertainties and contestations . These four women make clear the multiplicity of menopause based on their disparate experiences - life experiences which they see as slippery, confused and changeable . However , it is not only in women's stories that this messiness is apparent. Medical practitione rs who specialise in the management of menopause also tell stories of the complexities of menopause . One of the difficulties I find here is that because a lot of the problems around this time are what's going on in a woman's life really. A lot of patients' problems are really associated with big changes at home and often the depression you see around this time, it's difficult to decide how much psychiatric element you're dealing with, and how much is the sort of disillusionment or disappointment about what life's tossed out. (Nancy, menopau se clinic practitioner) At the time of menopau se so many other things seem to reach a climax and the actual cessation of periods is only one of many things happening at that stage of a person's life. I suppose the sins of the past rear their ugly head at this time and you often find a lot of other medical problems quite apan from a lot of social problems as well. I don't know if they've been blind to them before or just ignored them or just pretended that they didn't exist but I think that a Jot ofpeopJe 's coping skills are reduced because of menopause symptoms. (Kate, menopause clinic practitioner) These stories stand in sharp contrast to the factual discourse of the menopause as honnone deficiency account. The narratives of the medical practitioners involved in Ch. 1: Introduction the management of menopause indicate that they too are aware and participate in the messiness of menopause . It is not my aim to set up the official account of menopause as medicalised in juxtaposition to the non medicalised lived experiences of menopausal women. It is clear from the women's accounts that the discourse of menopause as honnone deficiency also organises their stories. Women's lives are constructed around hormonal production, reproduction and honnonaI loss. This honnonal organisation is interwoven with women's social and financial responsibilities, work obligations and personal commitments. The boundary set up between women's reproductive lives as medicalised and their social lived experiences as non medicalised has become increasingly blurred. It is the interrelation of these multiple facets which is of interest to me here, rather than their division. The stories of both women and practitioners highlight the mUltiplicity and messiness of menopause in contrast to the tidy official account in which these complexities are erased. My interest is on how the particular understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency has come to be given such credence. It is this 'official' account of menopause which fills much of the medical and general literature on menopause , inhabits menopause clinics and doctors' surgeries where menopause is managed, and also infiltrates naturopathic centres where 'alternative' management is provided. What prevails is a neat and logical account of menopause , with much of the complexity and messiness deleted. Just as this 'official' account of menopause has prevailed since the 1 960s when HRT reached its zenith, this same tidy, seamless account continues to be used today. I am interested in how this seamlessness has come about. How has menopause come to be understood as a problem ofhonnone deficiency , and HRT simplified into its clever solution? Moreover, how has this particular account of menopause come to be stabilised and taken up so widely? Underlying these questions is the notion of menopause as a social construction . I will argue that the account of menopause as hormone deficiency is not a given entity derived from the natural world, but rather is the result of processes of construction imbued with social, economic and political interests. I wish to unravel the threads of this account and understand the processes in its construction . The menopause clinic, where women's menopausal problems are diagnosed and managed, provides an appropriate site in which to explore this Ch. I: Inlroduction construction work. In unravelling this account, my focus is centred on the practices of the clinic. It is from the interrelations and processes of the menopause clinic, I suggest, that we can understand how the current construction of menopause and menopause clinics have come to be. The employment of feminist interactionist science studies enables this type of grounded analysis. Feminists construct menopause The notion of menopause as a social construction is largely the outcome of the important work of feminist scholars. In this section I examine these contributions, highlighting their value in analysing the social, political and professionaJ interests which work together to generate knowledge about women's bodies. Feminist contributions \" have been vital in generating different understandings about menopause. However , despite these benefits, some areas remain unchallenged and it is these areas which I address in my critique. 5 Feminists contributed to the menopause arena by drawing attention to the previously ignored phenomenon of menopause. During the 1970s, many feminists wrote of the paucity of information about menopause and noted that menopause had been a taboo subject for public discussion (McKinlay & McKinlay, 1973; Posner, 1979). Posner (1979), reviewing the available literature during this period, points to the prevailing notion in both the medical and lay feminist literature of menopause as a psychological phenomenon_ Biological explanations for menopause were under scrutiny during this time and whether menopause was a \"real\" phenomenon was actively questioned . Women's inability to cope during menopause was thought to be the result of poor self esteem and social adjustment. Despite their perceived radica11y different ideological basis, Posner highlights the curious agreement in both the 19705 medical and feminist literature regarding the failure to take menopause seriously and when 1 I acknowledge my generalisation in grouping feminism under one label. Although I recognise the heterogeneity of feminists and the emergence of different feminisms. J draw on the common concerns of these various streams j n their contribution to the notion of menopause as a social construction . Ch. 1: Introduction addressed, to relegate it to being \u00aball in your head\".4 It was largely feminists that drew attention to the various issues concerning menopause and in particular, highlighted the reality of problems which women faced during the climacteric. This paucity of information and discussion soon changed as interest in menopausal issues increased. Influencing this burgeoning interest was the widespread promotion ofHRT to prevent ageing, the link. between HRT and endometrial cancer, together with the controversies surrounding the oral contraceptive pill and other honnonal preparations. Feminists influenced the opening up of these issues to public debate as they ar,6'Ued against attempts to medicalise menopause. ~ With the increased promotion ofHRT and the prevailing understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . feminists argued against the notion of menopause as a disease and promoted the concept of menopause as a social construction. In contrast to a biological understanding of menopause, feminists argued that menopause drew its meaning from societal attitudes towards aging, the role of women in the social structure and the prevalent view of women as reproductive beings. The social devaluing of older women was used to explain the depression and loss of confidence women experienced around the time of menopause . Anthropological studies were used as evidence in the promotion oftms explanation .6 Cross cultural studies indicated that women from cultures in which ageing women were valued had less perceived problems around menopause . The outcome of these discussions was an increased interest in the phenomenon of menopause and the challenging of menopause as a biological entity, divorced from social influences . Proof of the success of these debates can be seen in the acceptance by even the most steadfast medical proponents of menopause that social factors influence the experience of menopause . Although many medical practitioners remained faithful proponents of .!

Lewis (199J) and SW:.lrtzman & Leiblum (1987). \" In Chapler 5, I discuss the anthropological and cross cultural literature on menopause in more detail. 6 Ch. I: Introduction HR.T in the <treatment' of menopause . they conceded that the menopau se phenomenon also has a social component. Wren, a well known HR.T proponent . wrote, 7 Often these women (menopausal women) live alone or in nursing homes, leading a singularly unattractive existence . They depend on pensions for financial assistance. are preyed on by the greedy and unscrupulous , ignored by relatives and regarded as a bother to the social and health care agencies (Wren, 1985, p. S 13). Wren goes on to advocate that to improve the outcome of menopausal and post menopausal women, \u00aba much greater attempt must be made to involve these elderly citizens in a positive role in society\" (Wren, 1985, p. S13), albeit in addition to treatment with HR.T. Another important contribution from feminists was in challenging what was perceived as the medicalisation of women's lives by doctors and the health system (Klein, 1992a; MacPherson , 1981; McCrea, 1983). These critiques challenged the organisation of menopause as a medical condition requiring intervention by a patriarchal medical system. In addition, attention was drawn to the profiteering of the pharmaceutical industry and medical establishment from women's menopause, particularly in relation to the use of HR T, both in terms of treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease. In The Menopause industry, Coney (1991) warns women against getting caught up in this market ideology and to question the preoccupation of menopause as disease which this ideology inculcates. Within this market ideology is the use of fear as an important selling point (Worcester & Whatley, 1992). Fear of ageing together with a fear of succumbing to menopau se\u00ad associated diseases is played on to seduce women into the menopause market. Worcester and Whatley join in the chorus of their feminist sisters in their plea to wrestle control away from the profiteering market manufacturers towards self -help and real prevention for women (Worcester & Whatley, 1992, p.23). The critiques of the patriarchal medical system contributed to the establishment of the Women's Health Movement. This important contribution sought to end the Ch. I: Introduction devaluing of women's experiences, and proposed to raise the consciousness of women with regard to their social position. The Women's Health Movement sought to not only improve the management of women's physical needs, but also to empower women by granting them autonomy in relation to their health care. In their challenge of patriarchy and the promotion of greater value placed on older women in society, the notion of menopause as a social construction was maintained and emphasised. Critique of feminist constructions of menopause Feminist analyses of menopause have been beneficial not only in providing conceptual tools with which to critique the notion of menopause as a universal disease, but also on a practical level, in improving health seIVices for women. The proposal by feminists that menopause was a social construction has provided a useful platform from which to expand options for the management of menopause. However, feminist critics have been reluctant to extend the social construction argument to biology itself. Feminist social constructivists challenged the cultural interpretations attached to the biological signs and symptoms of menopause. However, the knowledge of the physiology of menopause itselfwas rarely seen as a cultural! social product. I now address some of these limitations and point to some directions which explores this further. The first of these limitations is the maintenance by many feminists of various dichotomies in their analyses -social versus biological and cultural versus natural. In these debates. menopause as a social phenomenon is positioned in opposition to a biological understanding of menopause . Menopause is either seen as a result of hormonal decline with resulting physical signs and symptoms , or it is perceived as an outcome of social influences. The effects of social forces in constructing the contempo rary understanding of menopause have been widely discussed and debated. It is generally agreed in feminist debates that social forces, such as women's social devaluing , effects of the patriarchal medical system, and economic forces which maintain women's social position, all work together to produce the cultural understanding of menopause . However, there has been relatively little debate about Ch. I: lnttoduction the social shaping of the biological knowledge of menopause. Most feminist critics argue that menopause has an underlying biological reality resulting in physical signs, but that the meanings of these physical signs are sociaUy and culturally influenced . The following quote exemplifies this dichotomy. Menopause has a hiologicaJ base, yet it is an experience that differs according to cultural values. Menopause draws its meanings from basic concepts within the culture, such as the meaning of women's reproductive power, the role of women in the social structure, and attitudes towards aging (Theisen & Mansfield, 1993, p. 212, my italics). The biological basis of menopause is taken for granted and accepted as given, while the social undergoes analysis for its role in the construction of particular social understandings about menopause. In addition, many femirtist analyses rely on women's lived experiences as data. These subjective experiences are granted a certain authority and authenticity. and deemed to be divorced from social and cultural influences. I concur with Scott's critique of the authority granted to <experience' in many feminist and historical analyses (Scott, 1992). As Scott pointed out. \u00abExperience is at once always already an interpretation and is in need of interpretation . What counts as experience is neither self-evident nor straightforward; it is always contested, always therefore politicaL\" (Scott, 1992, p.37). [suggest that it is not only the social meanings of menopause which are constructed. Women's subjective and biological experiences of menopause are similarly constructed . In this study. I purposely blur the boundaries between the biological . the social and the subjective and consider their interrelations . A dichotomy is also evident in the nature versus culture debate over menopause . Many feminists promote menopause as a natural process in opposition to the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency (Coney, 1991; Greer, 1991; Sheehy, 1992; Worcester & Whatley, 1992). Menopause is viewed as a natural and normal life transition . Any forms of intervention , such as the use ofHRT, are constructed as unnatural. Menopause as natural is thought to be immune from social forces. This metaphor exchange from <menopause as deficiency ' to <menopause as natural' overlooks the constructedness of both these understandings . I argue that the notion 9 10 Ch. 1: Introduction of 'menopause as natural' is as much a construction as the understanding of 'menopause as hormone deficiency ', Social studies of science advocates the use of symmetry in analysing all views, together with refusing to accept such dichotomies as sociallbiologica l and naturaVcultural. I will show how the employment of the conceptua l tools from social studies of science not only extends previous feminist analyses but alerts us to new possibilities for thinking about menopause. My second critique of the promotion of menopause as a social construct ion by feminists is the emphasis placed on menopause as ideology. Many of these feminist critiques assume a direct mapping of ideology onto practices, with little attention directed towards the work of practices in the construction ofmearungs. The focus is placed on asking why questions at a social structural level; for example, why are certain ideologies dominant? On the other hand, how questions, which examine the processes and practices involved in the construction of knowledge, are largely ignored. This analysis of menopause as ideology refuses to engage with the technologies and practices which confront women users as they seek to manage their menopause . Women experiencing serious problems during menopause are forced to make decisions about whether to seek help, attend a menopause clinic, take HRT, have their bone density measured , and the length of time to remain on therapy. For women faced with these decisions, feminist critiques which do not go beyond the level of ideology are oflittle help. Furthermore, feminist critiques on grounds of ideology alone are limiting when advocating potential changes in terms of management practices. Using the tools of social studies of science and interactionist science studies, I ask how the particular understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency has come to be hegemonic . I focus at the level of practice within the specific locale of the menopause clinic. As I will argue in the next chapter, adopting this approach offers particular benefits and provides a different kind of analysis. Moreover , approaching the social construction of menopause as a problem of ideology divorces the technical and material from the analysis. The menopause arena involves both the social and the material. The social and material work together to co-construct particular meanings about menopause . Women experiencing menopausal problems interact with a variety of different technologies including HRT, Ch. J; Introduction bone scans, and mammograms . The outcome of these social-material interactions is vital in the type of meanings about menopau se which are generated. This point is crucial to this thesis and is elaborated at length in later sections. II I have pointed to some analytical tools which direct attention to the limitations of the current feminist critiques of menopause . Some feminist scholars have already attempted to address some of these difficulties in their work on the history of women's reproductive bodies. Margie Ripper and Nelly Oudshoom both challenge the neglect of biology as a social phenomenon (Oudshoorn, 1994; Ripper, 1994). The work of these two scholars assert that biology is itself a social construction and what comes to count as biology is socially influenced. The notion of a socially constructed biology forces us to confront the idea that subjective experience of our own physiology is inextricably intertwined with dominant discourses through which social relations (including gender relations) are negotiated (Ripper, 1994, p. 106). Ripper's work examines systems afknowledge about reproduction (Ripper, 1994). In attempting to characterise the essence of women's femininity , the focus during the nineteenth century was on the uterus. The uterus was thought to govern not only a woman's reproductive functions but also be the source of women's mental health. During this organistic era, obstetricians and gynaecologists were granted authority in providing treatment for reproductive ailments, primarily in the form of mechanical or surgical interventions to the pelvic organs (Ripper, 1994). By the middle of the nineteenth century carne a reconstruction of knowledge systems, as the ovaries supplanted the uterus as the focus of feminine essence. Furthermore , the early twentieth century saw the focus move from the organistic level to the cellular level as the field of sex endocrinology entered the arena. The endocrine model of women's reproduction posed a major paradigm shift in the understanding of women's reproductive functions and opened new opportunities in the treatment and management of women's reproductive conditions . Oudshoom (1994) outlines the growth of the field of endocrinology as she traces the developments of the hormone industry in the 19205 and 1930s. Through her examinat ion of the social and institutional networks involved in these developments she gives us a clear picture of Ch. 1: Introduction the social embeddedness of the developments and increased acceptance of the hormonal model of reproduction . Oudshoom traces the association of menopause with hormone deficiency and discusses the use of sex hormones to treat this deficiency . 12 Both these scholars emphasise the social and cultural forces at work within these different historical periods. Attention is drawn to the actions and interactions between different groups of players to generate particular knowledge systems. The interests. needs and strategies of these groups are followed in their production of new knowledges. A closer examination of the social interactions embedded in these paradigm shifts reveals the social dynamics involved in the production afknowledge and the construction of concepts which we now accept as neutral, objective facts. Using the conceptual tools of social studies of science, interactionist science studies and current feminist critiques of science, medicine and technology, I track the networks of relations in the menopause clinic to reveal the dynamics of knowledge production . It is the socio-material dynamics and interactions which will be the focus of this study. I explore the construction of the menopause clinic, the social, historicaJ and political interests in which it is embedded, and the tools, practices and materials which embody particular knowledge claims about menopause . Social constructivism In suggesting that the notion of menopau se is a social construction, it is important to explore the concept of social constructivism further. AJthough the fundamental ideas of social constructivism date back to Marxism, an important source in the recent resurgence of interest in social constructivism is the work of Berger and Luckmann ( 1966). Berger and Luckmann are attributed with introducing the phrase 'social construction' which has been taken up and used widely, not only in sociology but also in social studies of science and philosophy . As I noted previousl y, feminists quickly adopted Berger and Luckmann 's primary argument that reality is sociaJly constructed and readily employed this type of analysis to menopause . 13 Ch, I: Introduction Considering the 'social' What is meant then by 'social construction'? To explore this, I break down the term into its component parts -'social' and 'construction '. Sociological analysis offers useful ways of considering the 'social'. Analyses in terms of gender, class and race are pertinent and beneficial , as are studies of how these structural categories shape beliefs. Much of sociology seeks explanations in terms of the structural forces of ideology, power and economics. However , these interpretations have been criticised for ignoring the everyday practices through which meanings are generated . Garfinkel (1986), in his analysis ofthe growth and development ofthe legal profession , points to the mundane work involved -the everyday work of soliciting new cases, writing briefs, discussing cases, and negotiating strategies with clients. Garfinkel advocates an ethnomethodological focus which is centred on work specific practices and interactions , rather than the contextual influences on the site in question. In addition to ethnomethodology, other sociological registers, such as phenomenology and symbolic interactionisrn focus on micro practices and the generation of meanings through human interactions. Using different depths of focus and approaches, these various sociological frameworks share a common aim in contributing to the understanding of the social order. However, what constitutes the social for this group of sociologists are the interactions and the practices occurring at specific sites. Many sociological frameworks omit the material and the technical in their consideration of how society works and is arranged. Various scholars have provoked the rethinJcing of what is meant by 'social' with their insistence on the reciprocal entangling of the social and material (Haraway , 1991~ Latour, 1988b; Law & Mol, 1995. Pickering, 1993). These scholars challenge the sociological emphasis on human action _ Society is not only composed of human actions, but is composed of heterogeneous social-material arrangement s. The social and material are intricately linked and work in conjunction with one another. The menopau se arena exemplifies this socia-ma terial structural network. In my exploration of this site, I therefore need to move away from much of the sociological analyses which restricts my scope to just human actions. It is for this reason I tum to science studies for my analytical framework. The characterisation of the social and material is an important focus of this thesis and is elaborated in later sections. 14 Ch. I: Inmxiuction Considering 'constructions' Focussing on the metaphor ion' in terms of social constructivism , Sismondo (1993) outlines the various uses and applications of this term. Charting the different uses of the construct ion metaphor, Sismondo identifies both the processes of construction as well as what it is that is being constructed. In particular, Sismondo discusses the construction of facts and theories, artefacts, representations and most predominantly the production afknowledge, which has been of primary focus in the past. Although epistemology has largely been the domain of philosophers, the field of social studies of science has also centred its attention on the production of knowledge , specifical ly scientific knowledge . Challenging previously held notions of scientific knowledge as a distinctive and privileged knowledge system, the discipline of sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) has provided valuable critiques of the epistemo logical understanding of science (Barnes, 1974; Barnes & Shapin, 1979; Bloor, 1976). The focus of SSK analyses has centred on scientific beliefs -how certain knowledge claims have come to gain credence . SSK proposed a view of science that is not neutral, pre-given or separate from social boundaries . Rather, a picture is painted of science as a social construction , of scientists who actively work at constructing reality rather than unearthing it. This critique of science has also contributed important challenges to the traditional views of medicine and assumptions made about medical knowledge claims . Medical and scientific knowledge was assumed to be distinct from other forms of knowledge , according it a privileged status and making it immune from social investigation . Many scholars would now argue that medicine too is a social construction and that medical knowledge is a social product (Annstrong, 1983; Wright & Treacher , 1982). Medical knowledge is permeated with social, political, professional and historical interests and is a product of the social context in which it is constituted. The emphasis of social studies of science up until the late 1970s has been on scientific knowledge claims -how knowledge claims are historically contingent 15 Ch. 1: introduction outcomes of social, professional and political interests. As Pickering (1992a) clearly outlines, this focus on science as belief was replaced by a burgeoning interest in science as practice. Many empirical and ethnographic studies resulted from this new focus, all devoting attention to the processes of 'science in the making'. These studies tended to belong to one of two approaches . The first of these focussed on scientific controversies and the mechanisms of reaching consensus in contentious arenas (Collins, 1981). The focus of these studies remained on scientific beliefs; for example. how, in scientific controversies, one set of scientific beliefs won over the other. The second of these approaches concentrated on the actual site of scientific work, usually the laboratory . These studies examined what scientists actually do, their craft skills, their interactions with other scientists, together with their use of resources (Knorr-Cetina , 1981; Latour, 1987; Latour & Wooigar, 1979). This interest in scientific processes and practices was also emerging in interactionist science studies whose foundations originate in the pragmatist tradition (Clarke, 1989 ~ Fujimura , 1991; Traweek, 1988b). Although stemming from a different tradition to many of the social studies of science scholars, the interactionists have much in common with sociologists of science-as-practice and have come to play an importan t role in the social studies of science community . The main focus ofinteractionist science studies is on the inteb,rral interaction between knowledge production and practice. It is the everyday practices and processes which receive attention, for it is through these interactions that knowledge is thought to be generated . Although sharing many commonalities with science-as-practice. interactionisl science studies scholars have widened the scope of analysis to include the users and consumers of the products of science. Unlike analysts such as Latour (1887), Law (1986) and Richards (1991) whose primary focus has centred on the laboratory as the site of scientific work, interactionist science studies looks beyond this 'discovery phase'. In this thesis,] too look beyond the discovery phase of knowledge production about menopause as I focus on the work of the menopause clinic. My analysis extends past the scientists in their laboratories as I explore how the products of this scientific work are taken up, negotiated, and reworked by the various groups who are both involved and implicated by it. Feminist critiques of science and medical 16 Ch. 1: Introduction technologies have made explicit the analytic category of gender. Feminist contributions to both social studies of science and interactionist science studies have both widened the scope and the methods of analysis used in these disciplines . These points are elaborated in the next chapter, as are the commonalities and distinctions between interactionist science studies and social studies of science proponents . Thesis The menopause arena is controversial , highly politicised and riddled with complexities. Despite these multiplicities, one particular account of menopause is heard and privileged above the rest. [ am intrigued with how the account of menopause as hormone deficiency has come to be so ubiquitous . How is it that this account, from a myriad of possible accounts, has been taken up not only by the medical and pharmaceutical fraternity but is commonly heard in everyday conversations? This account which gives such credence to the decline of honnonal function around the time of menopause has been made increasingly durable as it has been taken up by new groups within the menopause arena. In choosing to explore how the concept of menopause as hormone deficiency has been stabilised , different paths of investigation and methods are possible. The most common type of explanation offered is the 'progressive discovery' approach which pervades much of the medical , Whitcroft , & Whitehead, 1992; Reeve. 1992~ Wren, 1993). This type of analysis identifies menopause as a disease of deficient hormones . Emphasis is placed on the discovery of technological solutions to combat this disease state, with primary focus centred on HRT_ The aim of \"protecting women's health\" (Reeve, 1992, p. 465) is used to justify further development and widespread use of this technology _ As I discussed previously , this type of analysis simplifies menopause into a problem/solution model, omitting the complexities and multiplicitie s involved. Textual analysis has been adopted by many scholars in their examination of knowledge construction of menopause . Dickson (1993) examines the metaphors of menopause used in different paradigms of contemporary menopause research. 17 Ch. l: Introduction Textual analysis of historical literary and medical texts dealing with different conceptualisations of menopause have been the focus of many studies (Barbre, 1993 ~ Greer, 1991; MacPherson, 1981; Swartzman & Leiblum,1987). Cultural constructions of menopause through film have also recently been the subject of analysis (Kozlowski, 1993). These different methodologies are used to demonstrate the social character of representations of menopause. However, as 1 have argued earlier, these studies maintain their critique at the level of ideology and do not engage with the processes which work to organise menopause at a day to day level. The stabilisation processes of such representations are rendered invisible as are the practices in which they are embedded . In grappling with understanding how the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency has come to be. I situate my investigation in the menopause clinic. Menopause clinics operate primarily within a medical context and function as specialist sites for the management of menopause , Women around the period of their menopause are assessed, managed and treated for acute symptoms associated with menopause , or receive preventive hormonal therapy for osteoporosis or heart disease. The menopause clinic brings together various collectives, including women seeking help or advice, gynaecologists, endocrinologists, and psychologists providing different fonns of professional management , as well as pathologists, radiographers, and technicians involved in screening and testing of conditions associated with menopause . In addition, there are material technologies such as bone densitometry, HRT. mammography , and ultrasound which aJl participate in the work of the menopause clinic. As I visited menopause clinics, I wondered how menopause , widely considered as a nonnallife passage. has come to be managed in the largely medicalised, specialised site of the menopause clinic where the concept of menopause as hormone deficiency prevails. What is the history of the establishment of the menopause clinic. a relatively recent addition to the institution of modem medicine? The consideration of the more general question of how menopause has been constructed as honnone deficiency becomes more focused in the locale of the menopause clinic. The path of analysis Ch. 1: Introduction examines the construction of menopause as bonnone deficiency . These are independent , although related research questions. My focus is on the collective actions and practices of the menopause clinic which both maintain the clinics' existence and are integral to the production afknowledge and understanding of menopause . The menopause clinic thus provides both an apt and interesting site in which to explore the production of knowledge about menopause -knowledge generated through the clinic's work practices and interrelations . Co-constructing the menopause clinic 18 This study is about the collective work of making the menopause clinic durable. This focus on work encompasses tools and practices. Clarke and Fujimura, using a interactionist science studies approach, employ the tenn 'co-construction ' to indicate the \"construction of the right tools for the job\" (Clarke & Fujimura, 1992, p. 3). In their analysis, these scholars claim that tools. jobs and rightness are all co\u00ad constructed and can only be understood relationally .7 Tools, jobs and rightness are all located in specific circumstances and are co-constructed with respect to this locatedness (Clarke & Fujimura , 1992). I employ this type of analysis to examine the tools/practices of the menopause clinic. I share Clarke and Fujimura's thesis that these tools/practices do not stand alone but are mutually constructed. Tools/practices such as bone densitometry are made into the 'right tool for the job' within the menopause clinic. The enrolment of bone densitometry into the menopau se network works to translate this particular technique from a measurement of bone loss to a material sign of hormone deficiency for which HRT is prescribed . In my analysis I extend this concept of tools, practices and rightness to a study of social-material practices in which, I argue, meanings about menopause are embedded . Collective work in the constructio n of knowledge is often rendered invisible or taken for granted as representations become increasingly stabilised . As the menopause clinic and co-linked model of menopause as hormone deficiency move towards being , Marc Berg also discusses the recursive relations between tools and practice in his study of medical decision SUpJXlrt systems (Berg. 1995a). 19 Ch. 1: Introduction taken for granted in everyday life, I wish to unravel the social dynamics and practices in operation within the clinic network which lead to its stabilisation. My focus is on practices. I am interested in the often ignored mundane practices and actions of the menopause clinic. It is through a sociology of these mundane practices I argue, that the menopause clinic maintains its existence, and beliefs about menopause are generated and embedded in everyday life. In tracing the processes of construction and stabilisation of the menopause clinic, it became apparent that fractures and abrasions exist in the seeming stability of the clinic and its concomitant understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . Ambiguities and contradictions were apparent in the network of relations. What appears monolithic and unalterable was actually the outcome of nested routines and stabilisation processes . Focusing at the level of these practices and actions makes clear these ambiguities and instabilities . It is through these instabilities that possibilities for change arise, and the potential for different ways of understanding menopause becomes a possibility. I have focused on the collective practices of the clinic and have ensured that my analysis remains grounded in the data. I have taken the stories of the women attending the clinic, of staff working within the clinics, and my observation of the practices operating within the clinics as my starting points. This type of grounded exploration situated the analysis in lived experiences and enabled the integration of theory and practice. The menopau se arena is highly politicised . Power relations are palpable as different collectives come together, often with very disparate interests, requirements and resources . Upon entering this arena, I was immediatel y urged to take sides. As 1 found during my field wor~ upon gaining entry to this site I was asked to state my position on a series of issues, including the use ofHRT -short or long term, the use of 'natural' therapies, the medicalisation of menopause, and the reinforcement of the model of 'fractured medicine ' by menopause clinics. In my analysis, I trace the power relations generated through the work practices of the menopause clinic. suggest that the technologies and practices of the clinic result in power effects. 20 Ch. 1: Introduction Power relations are generated through the enactment of social-material technologies. In shaping women's bone loss into a material sign of harm one deficiency, the use of bone scans results in power effects. The bone scan works to influence a woman's decision with regard to possible life long use of HRT for prevention of osteoporosis . This type of analysis exposes the power relations operating at the level of practice. Thesis structural overview My aim in this thesis is to examine how one particular understanding of menopause, namely menopause as honnone deficiency, has come to gain status as fact. I argue that this notion of menopause is only one of many possible understandings of menopause . I trace the processes afknowledge production generated through the practices used in the management of menopause. To do so, I situate my exploration in the site of the menopause clinic. This site is a juncture of many very different collective groups who come together to work at co-constructing a web of relations which acts to stabilise the clinic network. Menopause as hormone deficiency acts as a common thread in this network and works to weave this system of relations together. My particular focus is on the practices and interactions of these different collectives as they negotiate their way towards stabilisation of this site. Primarily using the theoretical tools of femlnist interactionist science studies, I stress the integral relationship between practice and knowledge production . In particular , I focus on the effects of these practices and the knowledge systems and power relations which they generate. The menopause arena is political and I am interested in the power relations which emanate from the practices and interrelations of the collectives operating in the clinic. It is this focus on practices, I suggest, from which possibilities for change emerge. Narrowing my analysis to this level reveals cracks and abrasions in the clinic network. It is through these ruptures that alternatives emerge and potentialities for change can be identified The thesis is structured in the following way. Chapter 2 outlines the theoretical framework employed . The theoretical tools of symbolic interactionism, social studies of science and feminist theory feature significantly in my conceptual toolbox. In particular , I employ interactionist science studies, actor network theory and feminist 21 Ch. I: Introduction critiques of science and medical technologies . This work exemplifies research as praxis, and integrates and works the reciprocal relationship of theory and practice. Chapter 3 outlines the methods and means of analysis used to address the thesis. It also highlights the importance of this type of analysis in examining how something has come to be, which simultaneously reveals the possibilities of other ways of knowing and understanding . This work is integrally political and my role as an analyst is explored in tenus oftrus political context. Conscious oft~e relatively recent emergence and specialised nature of menopause clinics, Chapter 4 provides an empirical description of menopause clinics, their functions, services and social and institutional contexts. In addition, I give a brief critical history of menopause clinics in Australia to provide social and historica1 context. Chapter 5 examines the construction of the concept of menopause. Here. I explore the processes of construction in the production of knowledge about menopause , and challenge the linear model of progressive discovery . I examine different understandings of menopause over different historical periods and examine the social, political and cultural factors which relate to these different periods of knowledge construction. In Chapter 6 I refocus on the menopause clinic as I examine the co-construction of this site. r examine the social engineering of the menopause clinic and trace the processes of enrolment of the various heterogeneous collectives which have come to inhabit the clinic network. Despite their differences , these collectives come together at this site and work together in stabilising the network of relations produced . Chapter 7 focuses on these processes of stabilisation . Tracing the practices employed in the clinic reveals how they work to stabilise the clinic network and reinforce the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . In addition, I explore the power relations generated from these stabilisation practices and follow the shaping of agency resulting from these power effects. Despite the seemingly stable facade of the menopause clinic and its concomitant notion of menopause as hormone deficiency , abrasions and ruptures become apparent. In Chapter 8, these abrasions are traced through contradictions which emerge, through alternative practices and through those collectives currently occupying the margins of the clinic network which offer potential disruption to the network of relations established . Finally, I conclude with a review of the preceding chapters, highlighting my key points. Befitting the political Ch. 1; lntroduction context of the menopause arena, I also give an empirical conclusion outlining implications for women's health policy and the management of menopause . 22 23 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools Chapter 2 -Mapping conceptual tools Introduction In unravelling the account of menopause as hormone deficiency. I focus on the practices of the menopause clinic. I argue that it is through the network of relations and practices of the clinic that particular meanings about menopause are generated. My choice of theoretical framework thus reflects and contributes to this focus. In my examination of menopause and the menopause clinic, I employ a number of conceptual tools originating from different research traditions. Key to my analysis are theoretical tools stenuning from the traditions of symbolic interactionism, sociology of science and feminist theory. Specific to these traditions, is the use of interactionist science studies, actor network theory and feminist critiques of science and medical technologies . Although stemming from different roots, common threads linking these traditions have become evident in recent times, I draw upon these commonalities in this study, in particular focusing on the practice-knowledge nexus to which these traditions devote much scholarly space. Specifically, actor network theory and interactionist science studies have provided me with important and vaJuable insights into how to examine the socio-material practices of the menopause clinic, and in particular, the integral relationship of practices in the construction of knowledge about menopause within the clinic, In discussing the conceptua l tools employed in this study, I highlight the factors which have influenced my research process. I begin by exploring the approaches in socioloh'Y of science, particularly focussing on the contributions of actor network theory. Similarly, I examine the tenets of symbolic interactionism and the insights this research tradition offers. In particular, I explore the contributions of contemporary interactionist science studies scholars whose work overlaps both sociology of science and feminist theory. Following this, 1 tum [Q feminist critiques of science and medical technologies which contribute to this thesis. Having constructed this theoretical backdrop, I focus on the conceptuaJ tools each approach offers to this study, justifying my choice in employing these particular tools and outlining their potential contributions. The adoption of any single theoretical framework within a discipline 24 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptua l tools necessarily creates certain limitations and omissions. However, disciplinary boundary crossing allows a greater degree of flexibility, encourages a more insightful and complex analysis and overcomes some of the limitations of any one particular theoretical framework. Social studies of science Social studies of science has provided valuable critiques in the epistemological understanding of science. Social studies of science challenges the image of an objective, rational science, totally removed from social concerns, whose goal it is to unearth truth from nature. Rather, social studies of science proposes an understanding of science as a social construction, saturated with social, political and professional interests. Arising out of the classical sociology ofknowledge8 came a burgeoning interest in scientific knowledge in the early 1970s. As Pickering (19920) outlines, the distinguishing features of sociology of scientific knowledge (SSK) were first, its commitment to the social nature of science and the presentation of scientific knowledge as a social product, and second, its method of exploring the social nature of science through empirical studies of past or current science. Pioneering SSK studies included the work of Bloor in the early 1970s. Bloor (1976) proposed four guiding principles9 defining what became known as the \u00abstrong programme \". The first of these principles is the concern with the conditions which give rise to scientific knowledge ; second, is the tenet of impartiality with respect to truth or falsity, with both success and failure requiring investigation and explanation ; related to this is the third principle of symmetry where an agnostic view is adopted regarding the 'truth' value of any scientific claims; finally, is the principle of reflexivity where one's own discipline is subject to the same patterns of explanation M For a comprehensive history of the classical sociology afknowledge. sec Barnes (1974) and Bloor (1976). 'J For a thorough discussion of the guiding principles afthc \"strong programmc \" of SSK sec Lynch (1993). in particular ChapLer 3, '-The rise of the new sociology of scientific knOWledge \". Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools as is applied to scientific claims. These principles have been taken up and further developed by many contemporary social studies of science scholars. A mapping of the sociology of scientific knowledge field becomes increasingly blurred following its initial inception in the 19705. One influential trend to emerge was a shift from social accounting for the success or failure of scientific beliefs to accounts of scientific practices that focussed primarily on the laboratory. This trend is characterised by a move from studies concerned with science-as-know ledge to those concerned with science-as-practice (Pickering, 1992a). Closely aligned to the strong programme, these studies paid particular attention to the experimentaJ practices, instrumentation and techniques used in the process of knowledge production (Pickering, 1985; Shapin & Schaffer, 1985). Prominent also during the late 1970s and early 1980s were studies of daily routines within scientific and laboratory SiteslO. These studies largely employed ethnornethodo!ogical approaches in analysing laboratory practices. The aim of these studies was to demonstrate the sociaJly constructed nature of scientific and technical practices. 25 In his discussion of this shift to science-as -practice, Pickering (1992a) outlines the inadequacies of the science-as-knowledge research in examining the complexities of scientific practices and processes integral to the production of scientific knowledge. Taking the laboratory as the site of knowledge production , the science-as-practice approach focused on the practices and processes constitutive of knowledge construction . As Pickering argues, the analysis of practice is not only interesting in its own right, but it also provides an insight into the constructio n of knowledge . This aq~>'Ument is vital to this thesis and is evident not only in the work of science-as\u00ad practice proponents but is characteristic of interactionist science studies. I draw on this argument as I explore the practices of the menopause dinic through which panicular understandings about menopause are constructed. III For a review of the major studies of this period see Knorr-Cctina (l983). These studies includc thc works of Knorr-Cetina (1981), Latour & Woolgar (1979) and Traweek (1988b). Although this period saw a burgeoning of ethnographic laboratory studies. these studies were predated by Ludwik Fleck's account of the development of Ih.C Wasscnnan test first published in 1935 (Fleck., 1979). 26 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools Key to this generation of science-as-practice studies was the focus on the laboratory, rather than individual experiments . as the site of scientific knowledge production. The emphasis here is on the 'discovery' phase of scientific knowledge and the focus is on the laboratory as the site from which this kn.owledge emerges. I return to this point in later discussions of contrasting studies, including my own, which focus on the < downstream ' stage of knowledge production and stabilisation. Rather than a single, clearly defined research programme , science-as-practice studies used a number of emerging approaches . Despite this, these studies shared a number of features (Knorr-Cetina , 1983). The first of these is the preference for analyses of micro processes in the study of scientific practice rather than adopting macro methodologies. Second, is the focus on how questions, which describe the processes used in the construction of science rather than explanatory questions positing causal antecedents prevalent in many sociological traditions. The third tendency is a constructivist perspective which acknowledges that outcomes are the products of interactions and transactions between participants . Actor network theory Adding a new dimension to the emerging laboratory practice studies are the contributions of actor network theory. In my unravelling of the menopause as hormone deficiency account, this theoretical approach offers many benefits. Fanning part of the structure of my theoretical framework , actor network theory allows a clear conceptualisation of the problem being addres:seu . In the following sections, I elaborate on the main tenets of this programme , outlining both its benefits and limitations in tenns of this study. The instigators of this approach, Latour and Woolgar (1979) together with Calion and Latour (1981), focus on how knowledge claims are constructed as facts through the collective process of network building. Actor network theory provides a means of analysing social and technological change. Conceptual tools are used to examine how entities become black boxed, stabilised and acquire a sense of taken-for\u00ad granted ness. This approach assumes that these changes do not follow a single 27 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools trajectory dictated by nature and internal logical constraints , but rather evolve out of interactions between heterogeneous actors. An important contribution is the acknowledgment of the involvement of both human and non human actors in this process of change. The aim of this programme is to understand how social changes are constructed by the actors within the network, rather than trying to explain why certain mappings have come to exist. Although the principles of actor network theory echo the constructivist perspective in social studies of science, in particular the science-as\u00ad practice stream, they also break from these traditions in advocating new and innovative approaches . Calion (1985) outlines the main tenets ofactoT network theory. A principal feature of actor network theory is general agnosticism in terms of science/society distinctions . Although this echoes the agnostic view of the strong programme , actor network theory takes this one step further. Refusing to differentiate between the 'contents' of science and its social context, particular interpretations of the social are not privileged or given credence over others. The aim of this programme is not to seek explanatory factors for scientific innovations and developments in tems of either social context or scientific cognition. Rather, it proceeds to construct a theory of action as it links laboratory practices to a wider network of technical and political negotiations. Using a semiotic approach, actors and actions are seen as network effects. The effects and relations of the various aClOrs are traced through strategies, practices and negotiations employed within the network. Another radical and controversial break by actor network theory from previous approaches used in social studies of science is its refusal to distinguish between human and nonhuman elements. Latour problematises the sociological usage of 'actor' as human agent. I use' actor', < agent', or 'actant'. without making any assumptions about who they may be and what properties they are endowed with ..... they can be anything -individual (' Peter') or 28 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptuallools The menopause clinic is a site of socia-material interactions. Employing this tool of actor network theory enables a decoding of the relations and interactions of the social-material practices and technologies which form part of the membership of the menopause clinic. This type of reading of actors does not inflate the position of non human entities as actors, but rather it deflates the role of humans. Rather than placing the spotlight on the external social world, the emphasis here is on the interplay of the social and material in the clinic -how they corne together, are co-produced. and work in relation to one another. Actor network theory's rendering of actors as problemati c allows an interesting reading of the tacit patterns of the menopause clinic network. Mundane, and often ignored, entities are credited a role in network building. Reading the interactions of the social and material allows a different kind of analysis of the ways knowledge is constructed and shaped. This semiotic manoeuvre also enables an innovative reading in tenns of agency and power relations within the network. Within actor network theory, power is not seen as an individual or collective property, but rather is seen as relational. Agency is not a measurable, given entity but results as an effect of a set of heterogeneous relations . It illustrates the possibility that agency is an emergent property. That to be an agent like a managing director is a fonn of action which derives from an arrangement . That, by themselves things don't act. Indeed, that there are no things 'by themselves' . That, instead, there are relations, relations which make things. (Callan & Law, 1993, p.2) Much of social theory adopts a view of power/agency as a form of domination -as 'power over'. However, as Law points out, to assume a view of power as a fluid which trickles down from the top ignores the strategies and processes by which it is created (Law, 1991b). This view of power/agency as relational thus enables a different kind of reading of the menopause clinic and the arena in which it is situated. In the decoding of the interrelations and practices of this site, power relations are read not just in terms of the social interactions , but rather through the social-material interaction s. It is this semiotic move which adds a different dimension to the analysis of the menopause clinic. 29 Ch. 2; Mapping conceptual tools In addition, actor network theory offers a conceptuallangu~ge useful in tracing the connections and patterns of network building. In tracing these patterns, actor network theorists have developed a series oftenns with which to conceptualise the process which Calion (1985) calls the 'sociology of translation '. Calion highlights four 'moments of translation ' which he uses to explain the processes of interaction and negotiation used in the building and consolidation of a network. The first phase, 'problematization', is one in which the problem and the main actors are defined and the interrelations between these actors determined. Problems are defined in ways whereby particular actors (human or non human) are established as 'obligatory passage points', making them indispensable to the network and the resolution of the identified problem. In the second phase, 'interessement' , attempts are made to stabilise the network by constructing a network of alliances and preventing competing forces from interrupting this attempt at consolidation. If this second phase is successful, the third phase, 'enrolment' . follows. Negotiations and transactions are carried out in order to overcome resistances and ensure the consolidation of roles assigned within the network. This is a complex series of events as alliances are forged, new groups enrolled and the network of relations reinforced . During the fourth phase, the representativeness of the network's spokespersons is tested as the network moves towards stabilisation . In any given situation, Calion argues that there are only a few spokespersons who speak on behalf of the entities they represent . In this process of representation, these entities are transformed into easily transportable , reproducible 'immutable mobiles', usually in the form of text -documents , graphs, tables, data which can easily be combined and incorporated into other texts. This translation also includes people, as is the case with clinical trials in the testing of new drugs and therapies . This group of disparate entities is translated into a consolidated network which can then be spoken for by the spokesperson , whose semiotic representations of the network contest to become authorised representations of reality. In this process of translation , not only are networks established and attempts made at their consolidation , but in so doing, new patterns of ordering and ways of understanding are also being constructed , displacing other configurations . 30 Ch. 2; Mapping conceptua l tools Despite these attempts at stabilisation and black-boxing, the actor network theorists remind us that these networks and black boxes are susceptible to challenges and destabilisation. The roles assigned to the actors are prone to disputations and new spokespe rsons can come to the fore as the once stable network undergoes changes and destabilisation. In its study of science-as-practice, actor network theory focuses on these processes and highlights how new realities that are simultaneous ly both social and material are constructed and shaped through network building. Contributions of actor network theory to analysis of menopause clinic network Actor network theory offers many valuable and innovative tools with which to analyse how the account of menopause as hormone deficiency has come about within the locale of the menopause clinic. First, the refusal to separate the human and nonhuman and the social and material is paramount to my ana1ysis. As will become evident in later discussions, the menopause clinic is a juncture where heterogeneous entities come together. Drawing attention to the material as well as the social components of these entities emphasises the integral reciprocal relationship of the social-material. This highlights the role of both the human and nonhuman elements in the construction and stabilisation of 'facts'. The second and related aspect of actor network theory is its emphasis on practices and system of relations. Actor network theory uses a semiotic approach to make sense of how entities co-exist. As Mol and Mesman (1996) succinctly point out, Semiotics is not about people, whether winners or losers. It is about signs, or other entities, co-constituting each other and together forming a discourse , a network, a logic or another 'Order ofThings ' .... Semiotics starts from the way entities co-construct each other. It tracks the way orderings are generated. In line with this, its politics is one which explores and exposes the orderings we currently live. (Mol & Mesman, 1996, pp. 433-34) The focus is on deciphering the network of relations, or orderings, in an attempt to read how it has come to be constructed . In analysing how the menopause clinic has 3l Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools come to be made durable, attention is drawn to the relations and transactions which produce and shape this intricate network. This focus on actions reflects the third major contribution of actor network theory -reading power as relational . Analysing power as being generated through social-material practices offers a different kind of understanding of the notion of agency. This approach highlights what gets included and what is left out of any given network -what is constituted as 'noise' and what becomes incorporated as network elements. Noise is constantly differentiated from order. Semiotics shows the effort that this takes. It makes the fragility of the established order visible, and shows that il is constantly in the process of being established . (Mol & Mesman, 1996, p. 433) The politics oftbis approach do not assume any given authority or power; for example, medical authority in the menopause clinic is not taken as inevitable or given. Rather, the emphasis is on how the established order of the clinic has come to be determined , and how it is that some elements have come to be included and others excluded . Finally, actor network theory offers a conceptual language useful to my analysis of how different groups have come together to construct and stabilise the network of the menopause clinic and the associated account of menopause as hormone deficiency . The 'moments of translation ' provide a language with which to understand how different groups define the problems of menopause . This language provides signposts with which to analyse the ways different groups come together, despite their very disparate needs, interests and requirements . The ways in which these groups are enrolled, their interactions with other groups and the transactions and negotiations which take place are analysed with the use of these linguistic signposts. In addition, actor network theory highlights the processes of both stabilisation and destabilisation as networks attempt to move towards consolidation . 32 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptua l tools Critiques of actor network theory Actor network theory has been subject to much criticism, with attention drawn to its more radical proposals . Consistent in the critiques levelled at this theoretical approach has been the inclusion of the material in the process of analysis. Conins and Yearley (1992) argue that the attribution of human actor status to material objects obscures the point that material objects require the use of human mediation for their operation. In their objection to granting actor status and thus power to material objects. Collins and Yearley argue for the reinstatement of the social in science studies. This humanist critique of actor network theory calls for a return to agency being situated squarely in the domain of human action. Collins and Yearley (1992) level a second critique at actor network theory in their proposal for a return to the why rather than the how questions in science studies. Although Collins and Yearley acknowledge the role of the descriptive approaches of actor network theory, they claim that this is insufficient . ... (Actor network theory) supplies an elaborate vocabulary for describing the means of knowledge making, but the vocabulary does not allow for explanations of why certain knowledge claims are accepted and others are not. (Collins & YearJey, 1992, p.J22). Other scholars have also expressed concern with the apolitical nature of actor network theory. Fujimura (1991) argues for the injection of a political voice into the argument. Although Fujimura acknowledges the importance of material objects and their interactions in the network, her focus remains on the consequences of human action. Unlike the call from Collins and Yearley for a return to why questions, Fujimura elaborates on both the tools from actor network theory and symbolic interactionism and caJls for both how and why questions in science studies. f want to examine the practices, activities, concerns, and trajectories of all/he d{fferenl participants -including nonhumans -in scientific work. In contrast to Latour, 1 am still sociologically interested in understanding why and how some human perspectives win over others in the construction of technologies and truths, why and how some human actors will go along with the will of other actors, and why and how some human actors resist being enrolled\" .. As an Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools analyst acting -not just observing -in the world, I want to take sides, to take stands. (Fujimura, 1991, p.222-23 (italics in original\u00bb A third critique from many feminists is actor network theory's employment of the \"executive approach\" (Star, 1991). Exemplified by Latour's study of Pasteur, actor network theory follows the strategies and manoeuvres employed by the executive (Pasteur) as he proceeds to 'raise the world' (Latour, 1988a). Although Latour examines the multiple faces and roles of Pasteur, Star is interested' in multiplicity of another kind. Star is concerned with multiplicity which arises from being marginalised . Rather than starting with the 'executive', Star urges us to begin with those on the periphery and the outcasts. Singleton (1993) joins in this debate with her claim that actor network theory does not adequatel y incorporate multiplicity in its analyses. Actor network theory, in its use of a 'top-down' approach. focuses on the network-builder . Singleton, together with Schwartz-Cowan (1987). advocate an approach which draws attention to users and consumers -actors often disregarded in actor network theory. This call for greater emphasis on the 'user phase' of network building parallels the criticism aimed at earlier SSK studies which focused on the 'discovery phase' of developments in technology. These early laboratory studies of technological developments ended their analysis at the stage where the technology emerged from the laboratory. How the technology is taken uP. reworked and stabilised by users and consumers was largely ignored. Both feminism and symbolic interactionism champion the call for greater emphasis on the users/consumers of technologies. which in the case ofreproducrive technolog ies are women. Rather than focus on the laboratory as the elitist source of knowledge production. feminist interactionist science studies draws attention to the user phase of network building. Responding to this call. this study focuses on the construction work of the 'user phase' in the stabilisation of the menopause clinic network. Another critique levelled at actor network theory is its obsession with case studies which represent either success or failure. Singleton . in her case study of the cervical screening programme in Britain, cites this programme as an excellent example of 34 Ch, 2: Mapping conceptual tools ambivalence (Singleton & Michael, 1993). This programme is both a success and a failure. This is highlighted by the ambivalence of the actors themselves towards the programme . This criticism highlights the tenuousness and instabilities of the relations constructed within certain networks. including that of the menopause clinic. A final critique ofactoT network theory concerns its discourse of liberal democracy. In its effort to stretch the rights of representation of human and nonhuman entities, as well as encompass the notion of relational power, actor network theory becomes prone to producing another grand narrative, of which it is so critical (Lee & Brown, 1994). Lee and Brown (1994), in their critique, suggest that in trying to incorporate all representations and in their development of a semiotic formulation, actor network theory purports to be able to decode all kinds of systems of relations, \"making it the only fully qualified speaker\" (p.780). In response to such criticisms, there has been a shift by many of the earlier proponents of actor network theory. I think we've started to shift, albeit only a little ITom the liberal panopticism of actor network theory. To move from that God-like place where the analyst looks down and counts the poor and huddled masses of scallops and machines. I think we've moved from that to a different and more pluralist space. (John Law in conversation with Michel Calion in Calion & Law, 1993, p.12) This shift is further exemplified in the addressing of concerns of difference and the 'hybrid collectif, rather than dualisms (Calion & Law, 1993). The proposal of a 'fluid spatiality' which presents a different kind of social space seeks to extend and address some of the critiques about actor network theory (Mol & Law, 1994). Mol and Law propose a topology, not fitting into the conventions of regions or networks, but rather a social space which exists and behaves like a fluid. These reflexive moves suggest a theoretical approach in flux, as concerns and critiques are addressed and new dimensions are generated . 35 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools Symbolic interactionism Analogous to the focus on science-as-practice in social studies of science is the symbolic interactionist approach to science as practice and craft (Clarke & Fujirnura , 1992; Star, 1992). Interactionist scholars, emerging from a pragmatist tradition which has concentrated on studies of work, communities and organisations , have applied these traditions to the study of scientific communities and practices. Although social studies of science and symbolic interactionism stem from different research traditions , they share many links. In their description of the assumptions in interactionist science studies. Clarke and Gerson (1990) make evident the similarities between the symbolic interactionists and the science-as-practice proponents in social studies of science. The first of the assumptions of the symbolic interactionists is the socially contingent nature of all scientific knowledge claims and findings. Second, no distinction is made between knowledge and practice, leading to the third tenet that the study of practice is best approached through the study of processes of work and organisations. Finally, symbolic interactionism shares with social studies of science the assumption that science, knowledge claims and scientific work are not essentially different from other work practices or beliefs. Similarities between social studies of science and symbolic interactionism echo through these assumptions with both being rooted within a constructivist perspective . Although similarities are evident, each framework offers particular conceptual advantages. Symbolic interactionisrn dates back to the United States of the late 1800's and early 1900's. Denzin (1992), in tracing the development of the symbolic interactionist tradition, situates the birth of symbolic interactionism with the works of John Dewey, William James and later George Herbert Mead.11 These philosophers argued for a pragmatist theory of \"interpretive , subjective study of human experience\" (Denzin, 1992, p.2). Of particular interest to the pragmatists are the meanings of phenomena and social interactions . Meanings are produced through social interactions and it is II Addelson (1994) brings to our attention the frequent omission of the work of Jane Addams from masculinist histories of symbolic interaelionism . Ahhough usually considered to be an activist, mther than an academic of the earlv 1900s. Addams's work is characterised by the same commitment to social action prevalent in the work of the symbolic interactionists of this period. 36 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools thought by symbolic interactionists that only through the study of social interrelations can the process of meaning production be understood . From its inception , the pragmatist tradition was steeped in politics and was regarded by many as a ronn of cultural criticism. John Dewey actively promoted a society based on open communication and democratic rights. As Denzin (1992) makes clear, \"it (the pragmatist tradition) located politics in the everyday experiences of ordinary people\" (p. 6). Although different political versions were promoted, early political pragmatism was a liberal politics trying to maintain the status quo of middle class America. Concerned with the democratic good of the whole, the pragmatists sought a means of enlightened social control. In his discussion of symbolic interactionism, Law (1994) signals this tradition as an optimistic version of liberalism and goes on to point out that this was not a radical or revolutionary politics but one that sought to bring about change from within. Despite wanting to establish a study of human experience, the early pragmatists paradoxically sought to do this within the objective rules of the natural sciences and designed their methodology on grounds of scientific validity. However, the methodology of rational science was abandoned and \"grounded theory\" methodology was developed in the late 1960s (Glaser & Strauss, 1967). This methodolo!:,,), emphasises the generation of theory from data; the data is analysed for patterns from which provisional hypotheses are generated . This methodological tool works in conjunction with the conceptual tenets of this research tradition and emphasises the knowledge/practice nexus. Social worlds theory From the Chicago school of symbolic interactionism came the development of social worlds theory. 1ntroduced by Shibutani (1955), social worlds theory provided a theoretical tool with which to study social groups. The units of analysis in Shibutani's social worlds theory were individuals , and individuals were studied in relation to their social worlds. For Shibutani, the social worlds were reference groups Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools who shared common perspectives. It was these shared meanings which were considered to be the basis for collective action. 37 The subsequent developers of social worlds theory proposed that the focus be shifted to collective action rather than shared perspectives. Positioning collective action at the forefront , it was maintained that it is through common activities that shared perspectives develop. In their adoption of social worlds and their subworlds as units of analysis, Becker (1974) and Strauss (1978) redefined social worlds. Social worlds are not bound by geography, ethnicity, class or formal membership but rather, are bound by effective communication. Although there are innumerable possible social worlds, Strauss (1991) outlined their common features. Each social world has one primary activity and a shared conunitment to this activity. The emphasis is on shared action, with the site of action being paramount. Complex technologies may be involved in these activities and organisations so as to enable and extend the collective activity. The fluidity of social worlds is an important feature in tenns of both their structure and the movement of the participants in and out of social worlds. In the process of collective action, segmentation of the social worlds may occur, resulting in subworlds. In addition, as alliances are forged between members of social worlds, intersections may occur between social worlds. Participants may belong to one or multiple social worlds at any given time. Enclosing all the members of the social worlds, subworlds , ideologies and technologie s is an arena. The arena acts as a conceptual boundary to all those with a shared commitment to acting within it (Clarke, 1991). It is the task of the analyst in symbolic interactionism to identify these multiple social worlds, their membership and their interrelations. As with Latour and Callan's net works, the social worlds are not static but are in a constant state of flux. The emphasis in symbolic interactionism and social worlds theory is on action, process and movement. Within and between social worlds are conflicts and tensions. It is the role of the analyst to explore these interactions, as it is through these interactions that meanings emerge. 38 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptua l tools Interactionist science studies The last decade has seen symbolic interactionism extend its scope ofinterest . A number of scholars have developed the symbolic interactionist approach to explore scientific social worlds. The foci of interest of interactionist science studies has included neuroscience research (Star, 1983), reproductive science (Clarke & Montini, 1993; Clarke, 1989), cancer research (Fujimura, 1992) and foetal surgery (Casper, 1994). Interactionist science studies offers a fresh approach to the study of science, placing new emphasis on science-as-practice. In order to understand the situations in which scientific work is done, Clarke and Fujimura (1992) propose that the multiple social worlds involved, the elements which make up the membership of these social worlds, including both human and material elements, and their interrelations must all be examined. The focus is on collective work, in this case on scientific work. Right tools for the job Clarke and Fujimura (1992), in their investigations of scientific work, provide an interesting approach to tackle this type of analysis in their proposal of the \"right tools for the job\" concept. Using the theme of scientific work as craft work!2, Clarke and Fujimura capture the concept of construction and more specifically co-construction . We are reminded that the notions of tools. jobs and rightness are themselves constructed and are given meaning through the relations in which they exist and within the social worlds in which they operate. These generated meanings are not fixed but are co-constructed within any given situation through the set of articulated relations in operation . In this co-construction are key processes including negotiating , crafting. standardi sing, stabilising and tinkering, all of which emphasise the focus on action (Clarke & Fujimura, 1992). In the co-construction of the menopause clinic, , examine the key processes which act to stabilise and consolidate the particular understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . In addition,' 11 In their discussion of craft work. Clarke and Fujimura (1992) refer to the tacit knowledge which is oftcn lakcn for granted and largely ignored in scientific work. By way of example. Slar (1992) in her cxposition orthc world of taxidermy . highlights the demise of this elaboratc craftwork. 39 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools explore the simultaneous processes acting to destabilise these understandings as they attempt to reconfigure the menopause clinic construct. Much of science studies is concerned with tracing how a panicular aspect in science has been stabilised or black boxed. Different analysts have used various tools to explore these processes of stabilisation. Actor network theory employs 'phases of translation ' and 'immutable mobiles' with which to analyse the stabilisation of particular technologies and developments . Immutable mobiles (usually texts) act as stabilising tools; they are transportable , do not fundamentally alter, are readable and can be combined with other elements (Calion, 1985; Latour, 1987). These tools offer a means, not only of continuity, but also of stabilisation. 'Boundary objects' offer another type of stabilisation tool (Star & Griesemer, 1989). Boundary objects act as points of intersection between different sociaJ worlds. Boundary objects are not fixed but are characterised by their malleability . The plasticity of boundary objects provides a means of enrolment and enables communication and interaction to occur between different social worlds. This allows both a way for each group to attempt enrolment of another, as well as facilitating the formation of new social worlds whilst maintaining continuity between existing social worlds. Within the menopause clinic, I will illustrate how the menopause as hormone deficiency account works as a boundary object. Employing this tool, J show how very disparate social worlds are enrolled and come together in the site of the menopause clinic. Fujimura (1992) further develops this concept of boundary objects with the proposed use of 'standard ised packages '. Within this 'package' are not only boundary objects but also standardised methods and technologies . The employment of these standardised methods and technologies, Fujimura argues, are the processes by which stabilisation occurs. Although similar to boundary objects in acting as an interface between multiple social worlds, 'standardised packages' provides a tool for analysing how a range of practices becomes restricted and how, through processes of standardisation, commitments and possibilities for action move towards a greater 40 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools degree of stabilisation. In the menopause clinic, the 'standardised package' of menopause as hormone deficiency , together with various standardised practices and technologies . acts to maintain and consolidate an established network of relations . In tracing the practices of the menopause clinic, 'standardised packages' provides a useful analytical tool with which to make sense of the interaction s of the menopause arena. Critiques of symbolic interactionism Much critique has been levelled at symbolic interactioni sm on the basis of the American liberalism from which it originates. Denzin (1992) describes the early symbolic interactionist s as 'cultural romantics' who sided with the powerless and outcasts, and attempted to bring about social democracy through dialogue and open communication. The early symbolic interactionists, such as Mead and Dewey, believed that through open communication, conflicts can be resolved and solutions negotiated . This early work presents an idyllic picture of co-operative activity. If lines of communication remain open and co~operative action is maintained , it was thought that disputes and differences could be satisfactorily resolved, resulting in a cohesive society. However, Law (1994) joins Denzin in claiming that contemporary symbolic interactionists have moved beyond this early optimistic liberalism. Just as critiques from feminists, post modernist s and other cultural critics have led to the elaboration and reconfiguration of social studies of science, symbolic interactionism has similarly moved beyond its optimistic liberal portrayal. Although still retaining some of its original tenets, contemporary symbolic interactionism acknowledges the complexities and conflicts of social action and its many inequalities . The focus of early symbolic interactionists was on human interactions . In their study of meanings generated through interactions. the emphasis remained on social interaction and human experience. Informed by social studies of science, contempo rary interactionists acknowledge the role of the material in their analysis of interactions (Clarke & Fujimura, 1992; Fujimura, 1991). However, symptomatic of Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools the sociological tradition from which they originate, the primary interest of these interactionists remains on human interactions . 41 While I am clearly interested in nonhumans (especially since technologies are human constructions), my interest is organized by the humans who care about, light over, and commit resources to these things. (Fujimura , 1991, p.222) Unlike actor network theorists, who emphasise the integral relationship of the socio\u00ad material and position the social and material equally in the foreground, the primary interest of symbolic interactionists remains with human actions. The menopause clinic is a site of social-material interaction s. In my analysis, the role of the social\u00ad material is key to exploring the stabilisation of this site. I argue that the symbolic interactionists' ambivalence towards the material is unwarranted, and extend social worlds theory to pursue and elaborate the social-material character of meaning. This has led me to use the term \u00abtechnosocial collectives\" rather than the tenn \"social worlds\" derived from the pragmatist tradition. To make explicit the social\u00ad material composition of the collectives of the menopause arena, I replace 'social' with 'technosocial'. 'Technosocial' draws attention to the heterogeneous nature of the membershjp of the menopause clinic. Despite the claims of Strauss (1991) and his fellow proponents of social worlds theory that social worlds are not bound by geography , ethnicity or class membership , the use of the term 'worlds' brings with it connotation s of geographical distribution. The term' collectives' I suggest, more clearly articulates the notion of a collective sharing of a commitment to action. out of which shared understandings develop. Although I acknowledge the symbolic interactionist roots from which my use ofUtechnosocial collectives\" is derived, in employing this tenn I expand the scope of this conceptual tool. A criticism levelled at symbolic interactionists and much of social studies of science concerns the prevalent focus on micro processes to the exclusion of any consideration of macro structures . Critics argue that macro social structures, such as class, race and gender are neglected and processes of power, wealth and conflicts arising out of structural inequalitie s are ignored. In response to this, Latour argues Ch, 2: Mapping conceptual tools social structures would lead to a simplistic. static and reductionist model of science and society. Latour discounts the use of totalising social structures arguing that \u00abactors are building their own society. their own context and asking their own questions\" (Latour, 1989, p.17). Fujimura (1991), although agreeing with Latour's 42 views, acknowledges that in interactionist science studies the incorporation of macro forces in the overall anaJysis can sometimes be useful and complementary . However, Fujimura warns that the analysis should not be allowed to be limited or constrained by these sociological categories and ideologies. To benefit from the use of macro structures , Fujimura suggests using them as <sensitising concepts,I3 to sensitise and alert the analyst to possible additional avenues of interpretation and approach . Rather than fitting the data to a set of social structures and ideologies during analysis, structural concepts can be used to increase awareness of other possibilities of interpretation and lead to a more mindful analysis. Feminist contributions Guiding this study are the numerous contributions from feminist scholars of science, medicine and technology. Although feminist critiques of science and medical technologies are an endeavour of the last two decades, these efforts have had major impacts on the way science and its developments are viewed and studied. In this section I will highlight in particular , critiques from the women's health movement of the 1970s, feminist critiques of science and the analysis of technolo!:,'Y from a feminist perspective . Disenchantment with existing health care services for women Jed to the establishment of the Women's Health Movement in the late 1960s -early 1970s. This movement called for an end to sexism in the health care system and demanded that health care not only satisfy the physical needs of women but also benefit women in terms of consciousness raising (Marieskind , 1975). Women's self help groups burgeoned with IlSlumer. a pioneer symbolic interactionist proposed the term \"sensitising concepts' to refer to the set or ideas used to guide. alert and suggest other alternatives during the analytical process (Blumer, 1954). In contrast. a.re \"defin.itive concepts\" which are abstracted from empirical data using standardised techniques with the aim of producing stable categories. 43 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools the first women's health care centre being established in Australia in 1973 (Broom, 1991). Information for women to recognise, define and address their needs was widely distributed; the best known examples during this period was the Boston Women's Health Book Collective titlesl4 which strived for female autonomy in tenns of health care. Scholars, such as Ehrenreich and English (1973), attacked the patriarchal medical system which led to women's oppression in terms of their health. Critiques were made at the level of patriarchal ideology. Calls were made to challenge the patriarchal medical system and end the social. political and economic oppression of women under this system. The critiques originating from the Women's Health Movement raised concerns regarding the analysis of scientific and medical knowledge claims. This analysis has been extensive and has contributed valuable insights into the construction of scientific knowledge. Feminist~ have drawn attention to methodological bias in research design, interpretation of data, and selection of subjects which contributed to women's omission from science on the basis of their inferiority (Bleier. 1984; Hubbard, Henifin & Fried, 1979). The publication of biographical accounts of women scientists attempted to recover the achievements and contributions of those women omitted from mainstream histories. IS Many feminists, focussed on improving the under representation of women in science, gathered statistical information on women in scientific professions , and their educational, employment and professional opportunitie s (Harding , J., 1986; Kahle, 1985; Rosser, 1988). Analysis has also been directed to feminist epistemology of science. Examination of scientific knowledge claims revealed a science based on masculinist logic and objectivity (Harding, 5.,1986; Hartsock, 1983; Keller, 1988). Scientific knowledge was characterised by the dichotomies of objectivity versus subjectivity . culture versus nature. mind versus body. the former representing the masculine and considered to 1\u00b71 This series oftilles was 10 cx1end over many years with the first of Ihe series being Our Bodies. Ourselves . published b)' the Basion Women '5 Health Book Collectiv e in 1971. I~ The best known examples of these aCCOW1l5 are the biographies of Rosalind Franklin (Sayre. 1975) and Barbara McClintock (Keller. 1983). 44 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools be distinctly valued over the 'feminine ' characteristics . Much scholarly space was devoted to exploring the reconceptualisation of a feminist science which would both embrace and encourage women's contributions to science as well as foster a more harmonious vision of science (Harding, 1991; Keller, 1988; Rose, 1987). Feminists have also featured largely in the debates over technology , in particular with regard to technology and social change. Of interest to feminists have been medical technologies, domestic technologies with the increased recognition of housework as unpaid work, as well as issues around gender and paid work including office automation and cornputing ,l6 However , the ideological preoccupation with women's reproduction is reflected in the extensive work on reproductive technologies. Debates have raged over the use of in vitro fertilisation CTVF), contraception, childbirth practices and the routinisation of prenatal screening . Fundamental to these debates has been the argument that reproduction is a natural process. The introduction of technologies into this process is seen as a fonn ofmasculinist domination over women and nature. The debates over childbirth practices are of particular interest due to their similarity to feminist critiques of the menopause arena; both are seen as natural processes and any fonns of intervention perceived as deliberate acts of subversion from the patriarchal medical system. Critiques of feminist analyses of science and medical technologies Many of the feminist critiques outlined have as their base an essentialist , fixed. dichotomous notion of masculine and feminine. The call for a resurgence of 'feminine' qualities into science echoes the historical searches for the feminine essence which governed much of gynaecological medicine of the 19th century. In conceptuali sing a 'feminine' science, feminists have sought to celebrate and incorporate women's subjectivity , nurturing and pacifism into this new vision of science. These essentialist views have been the subject of much critique for their 1~ See Cockburn & Ormrod (1993) and Wajcman (1991) for an extensive discussion of the impact of feminism on different sites oflcchnology . 45 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools failure to recognise the social constructedness of 'masculine' and 'feminine '. These categories are neither fixed nor unitary. Rather, these categories are the result of practices governed by social, political and historical interests. The association of females with passivity, subjectivity, and domestication have been reinforced, while males are represented by notions of activity, objectivity and rational reason. 17 These representations are not inherent, but are actively constructed and reconstructed. Another corronon feature of many feminist critiques of science, medicine and technology, and related to the essentialist critique, is the reliance on dualisms, in particular, that of nature versus culture. Integral to many feminist critiques is the association of masculinity with culture and femininity with nature. Feminist critics of reproductive technologies present clear boundaries between the notions of nature and culture with their arguments of childbirth and menopause as natural, and any fonns of technological intervention as clearly unnatural . A major contribution of post modernism, and social studies of science. has been the blurring of these divisions. Both nature and culture are constructed, fluid and changing categories. Many feminists justify their argument against the use ofHRT for the management of menopause on the basis that menopause is a natural process. What they fail to address is the ways that menopause has been constructed as natural. and HRT constructed as unnatural . 11/ AJthough feminists have made major contributions to the study of science, medicine and technology, much of this analysis has been levelled at scientific and medical knowledge claims. Trus type of analysis floats above practice and assumes that knowledge claims map directly onto practices . This argument parallels that within social studies of science in the shift from science-as-knowledge to science-as\u00ad practice. Feminism is concerned with social change. Analysis which remains at the level of ideology is limited to abstract, structural possibilities for change. However , 17 Sec JordanOVJ (1989) and Martin (1991) for interesting examples of such construcled gendered representations. I~ This point is elaborated in later chapters. with discussion devoled to the attempts b}' pharmaceutical companies to conSlnlct HRT as a 'natural' product. 46 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools analysis of practices and processes which examine how particular claims have come to be stabilised. can offer more concrete and practical options for effecting change. Contributions of feminist framework to study of menopause arena The feminist analyses and critiques which I have discussed provide beneficial and appropriate guides to my examination of the menopause arena. In this study I use gender as a sensitising concept. Although my focus is on the micro practices of the menopause clinic, I am guided by macro social categories. I remain alert to the category of gender in my interpretation and analysis. Social studies of science has faced much criticism for its notable omission of gender as a unit of analysis (Keller, 1988; Richards & Schuster, 1989; Traweek, 1988a). As a result of the work of many feminists advocating that gender be incorporated as an analytic category, issues of gender have recently begun to be addressed within this discipline , Feminist methodology has been subject to much discussion and debate. Much scholariy space has been devoted to asking if there is such a thing as a feminist research methodology , and ifthere is, what it looks like (Harding, 1987; Lather, 1988; Lather, 1991) Most feminists would agree with Lather's goal regarding feminist research: The overt ideological goal of feminist research in the human sciences is to correct both the invisibility and distortion of female experience in ways relevant to ending women's unequal social position. This entails the substantive task of making gender a fundamental category for our understanding of the social order. (Lather, 1988, p.571; italics in original) In studies abiding to these feminist principles, research methods are adopted which enable and encourage the inclusion of women's experiences . In this study, I adopt research methods and methodologies which focus on women's experiences in the management of their menopause . In exploring how the account of menopause as hormone deficiency has come to be made durable, I glean from women's stories a different system of knowledge . The juxtaposition of women's accounts to the Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools 'official' account of menopause makes visible women's often contradictory and multifaceted ways of understanding their menopause and its management. 47 Feminism also makes me alert to issues of marginality and multiplicity . These issues have been exposed in extensive debates within feminist circles. Women's occupation of marginal positions within the social order has been well documented. Increasingly, we have become aware of women' 5 different positions in tenns of ethnicity, class, sexuality, and geographical locality. Feminists working within interactionist science studies have highlighted these distinctions and made us aware of the difficulties in holding mUltiple membership in different arenas (Star, 1991). As I will argue, all women experience menopause. However , these experiences are not uniform. This heterogeneity of experience reflects the multiple positions women hold and the cost they pay in maintaining these positions . Feminist research ideology is about recognition of the category of gender in terms of social change. The menopause arena is highly politicised and fraught with controversies which affect the lives of women. This research, guided by feminist principles , seeks to highlight the political issues which women face as they seek help in the management of their menopause . This study is focused at the level of practice and it is at this level that I explore possibilities for change. I directly address practices and processes of menopausal management and do not assume a direct mapping of ideologies onto practices. The contribution of interactionist science studies with its focus on practices. together with social studies of science with its theoretical constructs . complement the guiding principles of feminism in this study. Crossing boundaries The conceptual toolbox I employ in my examination of the menopause clinic contains tools from different research disciplines including social studies of science, symbolic interactionism and feminist theory. Currently evident in the social sciences generally is a period characterised by the breaking down of boundaries between disciplines , reconstructions and new mergings . Within social studies of science, symbolic Ch. 2; Mapping conceptual tools interactiorusm and feminism, similar changes are under way, as feminists, post colonialists and post modernists in particular, question, critique and propose new ways of seeing. Amongst scholars who work in science studies there has been an increased use of cross disciplinary analysis. Recently, many scholars, including Traweek (1992), have advocated the use of analytical approaches which cross disciplinary boundaries. Traweek states: 48 Most of us doing social studies of science and technology are mired in our own disciplinary histories: OUf questions, our methods, our rhetorical strategies, and OUf boundary disputes with each other. ] am not suggesting that we abandon OUf niches, only that we be more conscious of the limits of our little terrains so that we occasionally can, with the proper visas, passports, and adapter plugs, learn to cross those borders to discuss our different versions of what I still presume to be OUT shared concerns. (Traweek, 1992, p. 444) In suggesting a reconfiguration of the key discourses oftechnoscience'9 Haraway (I 994) draws on the concept of the string game of 'eat's cTadle'. With this metaphor she seeks an entanglement of the discourses of cultural studies, feminist, multicultural, anti-racist science projects, and science studies to form a collaborative analytical means of making sense oftechnoscientific worlds. Cat's cradle is about patterns and knots~ the game takes h\"rfeat skill and can result in some interesting surprises . One person can build up a large repertoire of string figures on a pair of single hands ~ but the eat's cradle figures can be passed back and forth on the hands of several players, who add new moves in the building of complex patterns. (Haraway, 1994, p. 69) In his study of scientific ordering and organisations, Law (1994) has interwoven analytical tools from actor network theory, symbolic interactionism and Foucauldian discourse analysis. To avoid the problems of stereotyping and foreclosure of debate when locked within one tradition, Law uses a combination of these three approaches to b>uide his analysis of social ordering. 1<) Haraway collapses the notions of science and technology into \"lcchnoscience ' as she argues for their inseparability . 49 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools Between actor network theory and symbolic interactionism . similarities are evident. Both traditions are constructivist and argue for the embeddedness of social, politicaJ and professional interests within particular scientific constructs . The focus on interactions , processes and practices is evident in both approaches. Law' 5 (1994) use of a 'sociology of verbs rather than of nouns' is characteristic of both actor network theory and symbolic interactionism. Both approaches place much emphasis on action, process and practice. The focus is on mobility and movement associated with verbs - 'doing' words. The employment of stabilisation tools aims to convert these verbs into nouns, constructing them into stable entities of relative durability and continuity . Law's notion ofa 'sociology of verbs' is echoed in much earlier times by Dewey, a leading proponent of symbolic interactionism . It is no linguistic accident that \"building \", \"construction\" , \"work\", designate both a process and its finished product. Without the meaning of the verb that of the noun remains blank. (Dewey, 1934) Of particular importance is that both actor network theory and symbolic interactionist approaches ask the same sort of questions . Denzin writes of symbolic interactionism : lnteractiorusts don't believe in asking \"why\" questions . They ask, instead, \"how\" questions . How, for example, is a given strip of experience structured , lived, and given meaning? (Denzin, 1992, p.24) Similarly, Knorr-Cetina says of recent social studies of science: (Social studies of science) has a tendency to give priority to the question HOW scientists go about talking and doing science over the question WHY they act as they do ... the question HOW rather than WHY receives most attention from the analyst. (Knorr-Cetina & Mulkay, 1983, pp. 7-8) In this study 1 examine how the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency has come to be stabilised through addressing how menopause clinics have come to be established . In posing these how questions , I will argue that I simultaneously address why this particular knowledge claim has come to be. Like Fujimura , I am interested in both how and why questions (Fujimura , 1991, p.222). The menopause arena is political. How and why questions are obvious concerns when addressing the political 50 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools issues which surround this site. However, restricting my analytic scope to how questions offers certain benefits. Exploring how something has come to be highlights the processes of construction and shaping in particular ways. Importantly , how questions reveal that this understanding of menopause is only one of many possibilities , thus opening up the potential of other ways of understanding and other ways of seeing. Social studies of science, symbolic interactionism and feminism are noted for their acceptance of multivocality with regard to the actors in the network and the reflexivity of the analyst. Following the lead of feminists. these disciplines are increasingly addressing issues ofmultipiicity, in terms of both the analyst and the research participants . The occupation of multiple positions and the fluid transfer of membership between different collectives is an important analytical factor. Equally important is the inclusion of those collectives occupying marginal positions. Paying attention to these different voices results in research sensitised to issues of difference. Summary In my analysis of the menopause clinic I have chosen a number of different. yet complementary . conceptual tools from social studies of science, symbolic interactionism and feminism . This has necessitated crossing disciplinary boundaries and drawing upon different research traditions . However , crossing disciplinary boundaries can not only overcome some of the limitations of particular disciplines but also act to sensitise myself as analyst to other possible interpretations and understandings of the interactions being examined . Haraway 's 'cat's cradle' metaphor is a useful and apt reminder of the multiplicity and partiality of the patterns which we draw from our analyses. Using the knots of contemporary symbolic interactionism , social studies of science and feminism, J begin to shape some of the emerging patterns which arise from the menopause clinic. Specifically , I am informed by interactionist science studies which integrates many aspects of symbolic interactionism and social studies of science. actor network 51 Ch. 2: Mapping conceptual tools theory and feminism. To alleviate confusion, for the remainder of the thesis I will refer to my theoretical framework as 'feminist interactionist science studies'. In using this term, I include the conceptual tools outlined from each of these disciplines . Remaining within the boundaries of just one discipline would limit the types of analytical potentialities . Furthermore , no discipline encompasses all possibilities ; each is fraught with limitations leading to partial perspectives . I suggest that the employment ofthese different tools for the job of analysing will not necessarily lead to the \"right\" or complete picture but rather, will add to the richness and complexities of the story. 52 Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools Chapter 3 -Mapping methodological tools Introduction In the previous chapter, I outlined the conceptual tools used in building my theoretical framework. This chapter is devoted to methodological tools. This organisational separation of theory and method chapters suggests a binary division between these two categories . Despite this dichotomous organisational quirk. I want to emphasise a blurring of these divisions and endorse a sense of research as praxis in this study. Praxis has its origins in Marxist traditions in its call to unite practice with Marxist socialist theory. However, following the lead of Lather (1988), I use the term praxis to mean the reciprocal shaping of theory and practice in research. In her search for feminist praxis-oriented advocacy research, Lather looks to the reciprocaJ integration of practice informed from theory and theory generated from data. Lather's concern is primarily with emancipatory politics. She seeks to develop research which first refuses to divorce theory from politics. Second, Lather makes explicit that the reasons and the ways we collect data arises out of the theoretical and political perspectives we harbour. and in a reciprocal maIUler, theory is generated from the data which we gather. As r discussed in the previous chapter, this study draws upon the research traditions of social studies of science, symbolic interactionism and feminist theory. In my examination of how the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency has corne to be made stable, these theoretical registers provide the conceptual tools on which to build the study's structure . In addition, these theoretical frames also provide particular methodologies . The data collected for the study provides the necessary materials in this construction . The reciprocity of structure to materials is tantamount to theory and data. Each of the three theoretical frameworks I employ are not characterised by distinct research methods. However , what is distinctive about each of these registers is the particular methodological tools they offer. In her discussion of feminist epistemologies, Harding (1987) questions whether there is a distinctive feminist 5) Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools method. To clarify her argument Harding distinguishes between method, methodology and epistemology . Harding defines method as techniques for gathering evidence, methodology as the theory and analysis which informs the process of the research, and epistemology as a theory of knowledge which poses questions such as who are the \"knowers\" and what counts as \"knowledge\". Harding argues that all three are integrally related. However , she concludes that what is distinctive about feminist research is not the use of feminist methods, but the use offeminist methodology and epistemology. In this study, the methods used are not distinctively feminist but rather they are informed by feminist methodology and epistemology, both acting as sensitising concepts during the process of the research. This study is not a feminist one just because it is about women and includes women as its participants. What enables this work to be labelled feminist is my emphasis on how women become managers of their menopause . Within the menopause arena, I do not portray women as passive receptors or victims of the system. In this research, I explore how women actively manage their menopause. The study not only gives voice to women but highlights how women are produced as active agents within this network of relations. With its focus on inclusion and active participation, feminist methodolO!,'Y and epistemology also informed my use of feedback of the research findings to the study's participants . Analogous to the lack of a distinctive feminist method, there is also no distinctive social studies of science method. However , as 1 discussed in the previous chapter. actor network theory offers a particular methodological framework . Actor network theory provides a conceptual lanh71Jage with which to .b'llide the process of analysis in the establishment of menopause clinics. Calion's 'moments of translation , act as linguistic signposts in tracing the process ofoetwork building (CaHon, 1985). [0 addition, the tenets of actor network theory alert me to particular factors, in particular , the relationship of the social and material, and the generation of power relations from social-material practices . These methodological tools are reflected in my choice of interview questions and my process of analysis. Although symbolic interactionism is also not characterised by any distinctive method, the research methods of grounded theory originate from this research tradition. 54 Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools Glaser and Strauss (1967), in their development of grounded theory methods, emphasise , as the name suggests, the groundedness of theory in data. Glaser and Strauss dissolve the distinction between theory and practice, advocating a method which en~ures that theory is generated from the data from which it originates. Although steeped in local data, grounded theory seeks to go beyond local situations in its construction oftheary . However, unlike more formal theoretical frameworks , it is not constrained by rigid strucruraJ boundaries. Grounded theory is a rich methodological tool which does not limit analytical possibilities, but rather, emphasises plurality and flexibility . In later sections, I elaborate on these points and describe in more detail my use of this methodology. In the remainder of this chapter I focus on the actual methods and methodologies employed in this study. Underlying this discussion is the reciprocal relationship which exists between my theoretical structure and the methodological practices used. The data collected directly reflects my choice of methodologies, which in turn reflects the theoretical framework in use. My choice of research process is justified in tenns of the types of questions I wish to pose and the political context in which the work is situated. This brings into consideration the political and moral responsibilities involved in conducting this type of work. In this regard I discuss my role as an analyst and draw on the work of an increasing number of scholars whose interests lie in the responsibilities of doing work around issues of social controversy . Menopause clinic as study site The menopause clinic as study site provides an interesting and relatively recent example of a complex technological system within which to examine the production and shaping of particular understandings of menopause. Menopause clinics are interdisciplinary and are sites of intersection of many different technosocial collectives. In addition, menopause clinics do not stand isolated but are situated within a wider institutional , social and historical context. In this way, menopause clinics provide an appropriate site to examine the interaction of scientific and social understandings of menopause, together with the experiences and understandings of menopausal women who attend the clinic. The choice of this site also enables the Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools examination of the practices. skills, expertise, experiences and tools which each collective brings to the co-construction of the menopause cUnic. I explore how this co-construction in its current form has come to be made stable, together with the social and institutional forces which have influenced its formation and continue to impact upon it. 55 Five, out of a possible eight, menopause clinics were chosen as study sites. All the clinics were located in the urban region of a large Australian capital city. Menopause clinics were distinguished from other centres, such as women's health centres, as specifically directed towards the management of issues around menopause . Of the five menopause clinics participating in the study, three were located within the public hospital system20 and the remaining two were private clinics21 not directly receiving government support. The two private clinics operated on a full time basis and utilised the services of mostly private organisations for provision of pathology tests and other screening technologies. The three public clinics operated on a sessional basis only. (mostly one or two half days per week) and generally utilised the services within the public hospital in which they were located. Methods Multiple sources afdata were used as the basis of this research. The major data source consisted of in depth interviews with women attending menopause clinics and statfworking within them. A total of 45 women and 21 clinic staff participated in individual interviews . In addition, 8 women participated in a group interview which was used to trial the interview questions and obtrun general comments before ~\"Two of the three public hospital menopause clinics operated as outpatient hospital clinics where women could auend on a scssional basis. free of charge. The third clinic. although associated with a large public hospit.1L operated on a fce for service basis with the majority of the fee rerunded to the clients under the Medicare system. These scrvices are funded out or the Australian Medicare system rrom the government health care budget to which all taxpayers contribute a percentage of their mcomc. :1 Both private clinics operated on a fee for service basis wiLh a proportion of these costs refunded to the client under the Medicare system. One ofthcsc clinics was funded solely from profits made from services charged. whHe the other operated as a non profit organisation relying largely on grants and donations for its continued operation. 56 Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools commencement of the individual interviews . The individual interviews were semi structured with a set of questions used as a guide to the interview. The participants were encouraged to divert from the questions if they chose, or to add to the discussion at any stage of the interview. Each pru:ticipant was able to choose the location of the interview (most of the interviews with the women were conducted in their homes, and most of the staff interviews were conducted in the clinic). The duration of the interviews with the women attending the clinic ranged between 1-4 hours ~ the staff interview s were generally much shorter (0.5-1.5 hours)22. Informed consent23 was sought and obtained from all the participants and all participation was voluntary. When permission was granted, the interviews were audiotaped; otherwise, detailed notes were taken. In addition to the interview data, I made extensive use of primary sources from the medical and scientific literature about menopause . Both contemporary and historical primary sources were used for analysis, together with secondary sources on competing historical conceptualisations of menopause. My field work also included attendance at public information sessions, promotional seminars and medical education meetings conducted by the clinic practitioners . During my fieldwork, r spent time in each clinic examining the clinic's practices, approaches and ways of operation . The availability and use of in house technologies were examined, together with the physical layout of the clinics to detennine the type of physical and social ~~ The interviews with the women attending the clinic were generally very informaL laking the shape of a casual. and often intimate. conversation rather than a fonnal interview. As noted by other scholars whose research methods have involved interviewing women (Edwards. 1993: Finch. 1984). the conclusion of the \u00b7\u00b7intcrviev .... was more oftcn than not marked wilh the women interviewing me (usually over a eup of coffee. as they constructed a more social sclling). The women were interested in personal details about my choice of topic. what prior work I had done. and my private life\u00ad whether I was married. had children elC. In addition 10 this. they were very interested to know what othcr women had said and about my views on the issues they had raised in our discussion. In all cases. I answered their questions as I thought appropriate . ~'The study was approved by four ethics committees. Eaeh public hospiLaI clinic required approval from irs institutional ethics committee <lS well as the university ethics commiucc. Granting of informed consent from the panicipants was an integral requircment of the ethics comminccs . Of interest. was the influence of thc ethics committees during the early stages of the study in the construction of the research process to be used. Being largely unfamiliar with qualitative research. the ethics commiuecs were panicularly concerned in ensuring the reliability and validity of this type of research. 57 Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools environment created. In addition, textual materials used in each clinic were examined. These texts included promotional materials. policy statements, evaluation questionnaires, educational materials as well as technological health assessments. As discussed earlier, my choice of methods was influenced by the methodological tools of my theoretical structure. Symbolic interactionism, with its emphasis on work practices and organisations , is reflected in my choice of menopause clinics as sites of study. Menopause clinics are specific sites in which the practices wltich produce, shape and sustain particular understandings of menopause can be examined and analysed. In my attempt to trace the processes of network building of the clinic, the tools of actor network theory are reflected in the types of questions used in the interviews. In addition, this particular theoretical framework alerts me to material effects and the ways in which the material is used and incorporated in the network of relations within the menopause clinic. Feedback Oakley (1981), in her discussion of interviewing methods influenced by feminist methodolo&'Y and epistemology, outlines the following approaches. First, she suggests that the researcher adopt a non-exploitative attitude towards interviewees . Second, Oakley suggests a shift from being a collector of data/or the researchf!r, to a collector of data/or the researched. In this way the perspective s and views ofthe women participating are promoted. Influenced by OakJey and other feminist researchers , interviews were conducted according to these principles . In addition, I chose to feedback the findings of the study to the participant s involved. Following preliminary analysis of the results, all the participants were recontacted and asked if they wished to have feedback on the study's findings. 70% of the women clinic attendees and aJl five clinics responded positively and were sent a copy of the findings with an invitation to comment and give feedback . A small group of women returned for a group discussion and two women contacted me with feedback . Meetings to discuss the study's findings were also carried out with each of the clinics, and, in the case of two clinics, seminars were also arranged to discuss the Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools study's findings with the wider hospital community. This feedback is an important component of research which aims to involve its participants and make comments about the political nature of the research. In addition, I was able to validate my analysis, thus ensuring that my interpretations of the findings at least jelled with the participants' own interpretations . Analysis 58 Grounded theory served to guide the analytical stages of this study. Grounded theory approach resulted from a collaboration of Strauss, working largely in the pragmatist tradition and Glaser, whose interest at the time was the development of a systematic research procedure for empirical research (Strauss & Corbin, 1990, p.24). The outcome of this collaboration was a qualitative research approach24 which has been used widely in many different disciplines. My analysis consisted of organising the data into a system of coded patterns and provisional categories. From these coded patterns and categories , ] was able to generate provisional hypotheses which could then be checked against the data still to be analysed or new data which the provisional hypotheses suggested should be collected, for example additional interviews . Throughout the analytical process, provisional hypotheses underwent constant probing and checking against new data. This systematic procedure ensured that the theory generated was finnly grounded in the data, and also secured the validity of the hypotheses being generated . It became clear when I had reached the stage of provisional hypotheses as patterns which had emerged in the early stages of the analysis were repeated in the stories of ensuing In[efYlewee s. ~\u00b71 The grounded theory approach uses a systematic set of research procedures whose aim is to develop inductively derived theory from data (Strauss & Corbin. 1990). This is in contrast to the deductive research design used in positivist traditions where the aim is to test a particular hypothesis using data from a particular sample group. The starting point of a grounded theory approach is a research question. rather Ihan a hypothesis as occurs with much quantitative research. Sampling is detcnnincd not by selecting a proportion of the population from which one wan1.5 10 make significant generalisations . but rather by whether Ihe sample is representative of the phenomena under study. Sampling is not necessarily a discrete aClh'ity. but may continue throughout the process as hypotheses are generated and further sampling is required with which to lest these provisional nypotheses . 59 Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools During the generating of patterns and provisional hypotheses , I remained sensitised by the conceptual tools of actor network theory, interactionlst science studies and ferrunism . The language and conceptual framework offered by these theoretical registers both guided and alerted me to patterns and categories which may otherwise have remained invisible. In addition, I made use of macro structural categories. such as class, ethnlcity, wealth and professional power to further sensitise my analysis of potential categories and emergent patterns. This use of sensitising concepts during analysis ensured a rich and complex building oftheoreticaI perspectives . As Fujimura states, grounded theory approach is \"3 polemic against grand theories\" (Fujimura , 1991, p.226). Echoing the voice ofpostmodemism, this approach refuses to be limited to one theory and be constrained to strict structural boundaries. Citing Strauss, Fujimura adds, \"phenomena are so rich that we should mine them for more stories, more concepts , more 'h7founded theories', more ways of 'seeing phenomena '\" (Fujimura , 1991, p.226). Following this lead, my aim was not towards generalisable or universal theories, but rather I sought to understand the interactions of the technosocial collectives in the menopause clinic as they strived towards establishing a stable arena. In doing so, I acknowledge that my interpretation is one of many possible understandings and that what I offer can only ever be a partial perspective . As Haraway reminds us, our aim in doing responsible research, is \"partial, locatable , critical knowledges sustaining the possibility of webs of connections called solidarity in politics and shared conversation s in epistemolo!:, 'Y\" (Haraway, 1991, p.191). Praxis and politics The menopause clinic is embedded in a highly poiiticised arena. Vigorous disputes and controversies centre on issues of social policy, medicalisation and feminist politics. My role as analyst was brought into question as I became enrolled in this controver sial arena. Research of controversial issues traditionall y demand a methodological separation of the researcher from the researched to enable a symmetric analysis. Scan, Richards and Martin (1990) critique such demands for 60 Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools neutrality of the researcher and argue that analysts become of necessity \"captives of the controversy\" . Citing incidents from their own research, Scott, Richards and Martin claim that the use ofa symmetrical analysis of the social construction of knowledge works in favour of knowledge producers who have been marginalised , and against the interest of groups whose claims have become dominant . Navigating my way around the multiple technosocial collectives which inhabit the arena of the menopause clinic, I became aware of attempts by some groups to enrol me as they endeavoured to maintain their existence, status and political ground. To illustrate this point, some of the public hospital clinics participating in the study were facing, and continue to face, possible closure in the current Australian health care climate of severe budget cuts. Public hospital clinics and departments are confronted with demands to justifY their continued existence . These clinics are required to prove their worth by providing data on service provision, whether needs are being met and targets achieved. In co-operating in this study, some clinics hoped that some of these institutional demands would be addressed by the study's findings, and thus be useful in ensuring their continued existence and funding. In another example, menopausal women sought improved service provision in the health care system. In voicing their concerns to me, these women felt that not only did they gain someone who would listen to them, but they also hoped to gain a voice through which some of their concerns could be heard. As Fujimura (1991) argues, analysts are also actors. Our analysis and interpretations are guided by our perspectives and position. This situation is unavoidable. However, to enable readers to reach their own conclusions about our work, Fujimura advises making our perspectives clear and explicit, taking into account the multiplicity of our own positions as well as those of the groups we study. As I have described previously , the menopause clinic is a site where many different technosocial collectives meet and disciplinary boundarie s cross. In analysing this interdisciplinary site, I act as a boundary worker, who, echoing the words of Traweek (1992), is armed with the necessary visas and passports , feeling both compelled and intrigued as J move across borders, (often defying the border police), yet emerging from it enriched by the multiplicity oftms arena. 61 Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools The notion of politics in research is not new or novel. Marxist, feminist and post colonialist studies have highlighted the embeddedness of politics in many research sites. Studies in the pragmatist tradition have historically. been rooted in politics. Recently, many scholars in other disciplines have called for more socia1ly useful research. Chubin and Restivo (J 983) appeal to fellow social studies of science scholars to engage in a greater level of social and political activism in the area of science policy. Brian Martin (1993) argues that social studies of science has become removed from socia-political issues. In sheltering within the confines of academia, Martin claims that social studies of science has become inaccessible to social and political activism. Martin suggests that scholars of social studies of science relocate their work in issues which serve a social and political purpose. This call to break down the boundaries between academic work and the \"social world\" is echoed in the work of Emily Martin (1992) in which she calls for greater integration between community work and academic work. The work of Addelson pushes the break down of the academy and the community much further. Rooted in the symbolic interactionist understanding that meanings are constructed through social interactions, Addelson focuses on the collective action of knowledge making. Addelson argues that social organisation is crucial to making knowledge and furthennore that \"making knowledge is a political act\" (Addelson, 1993, p. 267). In a world of interaction s and active construction, Addelson (1991) asks how as researchers , we study these processes of knowledge construction in a moral and responsible way. In tackling this question Addelson (1994) suggests taking a collectivist perspecti ve to knowledge making. Addelson 's interests lie in the processes involved in making moral problems public, a fitting description to knowledge making in the menopause arena. In seeing knowledge making as a collective rather than as an individual process, the focus shifts from the knowledge produced to how knowledge and understanding is constructed. Addelson finnly advocates positioning the researcher within the collective under scrutiny, fanning, together with the technosocial collectives , a 'community of knowers ~. The inclusion of the researcher in the collective ensures both reflection of the process of knowledge making as well as self reflexivity as the researcher too is involved in the process of making knowledge . This reflexivity is critical, Addelson suggests, in doing Ch. 3: Mapping methodological tools morally responsible work. Sensitised to the authority we hold as researchers, by focussing on the process afknowledge making we can reflect on our role in this process of collective interactions . Summary 62 Embedded in this study is the notion of research as praxis. My three-cornered theoretical framework , comprised of interactionist science studies, actor network theory, and feminist theory, offers not only conceptual tools to this study but the provision of methodological tools. These theoretical registers do not propose distinct research methods but rather offer characteristic methodologies . It is the reciprocal relationship between theory and methodology that I exploit in this study. As Lather (I 988) reminds us, our means of collecting data. the type of data we collect and the reasons we collect data reflect our theoretical perspectives. Reciprocally , the theory we generate is necessarily infonned by the data we collect. My description of the methods employed in this study reflect the methodologies which infonn them. The menopause arena is riddled with social controversies . In working in this polemical site, my role as analyst and researcher comes into question. Addelson, together with many other scho lars, urges us to do morally responsible and socially useful work. The methodological tool of b,rrounded theory ensures a process of reflection throughout the analytical process. The aim of grounded theory is to generate theories. not an abstract set of universal hypotheses , but meaninb.ful theoretical concepts grounded in data. In the context of this study, data is derived ITom studying the interactions and negotiations of the techno social collectives involved in the menopause arena. The reciprocal shaping of theory and practice inherent in grounded theory lead s to research which has important theoretical implications as well as consequences for practice. Feminist methodology and contemporary social studies of science act as guides, both in terms of the process of doing research as well as acting as reminders of the importance of doing socially useful research. Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic Chapter 4 -Situating the menopause clinic Introduction 63 Having outlined the conceptual and methodological tools employed in this study, I tum now to the site of the menopause clinic. The menopause clinic, although a construction of contemporary times, is imbued with historical factors. To give context to its current construction I give a brief historical overview of menopause clinics, in particular menopause clinics in Australia. Historica1 accounts are often read as trajectories outlining a smooth path towards progress. However, closer examination of these accounts reveals the social, political and professional factors entangled within these trajectories. The establishment of the menopause clinic can be read simply as a solution designed to solve the problems associated with menopause . However, this is an impoverished reading that erases many factors influential in its development. I suggest that the establishment of the menopause clinic has to be examined in the context of shifts in the construct ion of knowledge about menopause , developments in hormonal therapy, professional interests around issues of menopause as well as social and political factors surrounding women's health care. Following a discussion of the influential factors involved in the establishment of menopause clinics, I tum to the site of the menopause clinic -its location, constituents, and physical and social architecture . I sketch the locale of the menopause clinic and highlight the physical and social environment constructed within these sites. These accounts situate the participating public and private menopause clinics within their respective social and institutional contexts. Establishing menopause clinics In 1967 what is thought to be the first menopause clinic was established in South Africa. WulfUtian , a well known proponent for the use of oestrogen therapy during menopause , was responsible for the establishment of the outpatient menopause clinic at the Groote Schuur Hospital in Cape Town, South Afiica (Uti an, 1976). Utian sought to have this clinic serve as a role model for the establishment of other 64 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic menopause clinics around the world. The focus of this model was on centralised care and control. The value of the menopause clinic was thought to be its ability to concentrate medical expertise and experience in one centre, together with the reciprocal potential of attracting a considerable p.opulation of menopausal women. Employing a masterful panoptic stroke, Utian established this clinic as a 'well woman clinic'. creating the opportunity for screening menopausal women who may not otherwise seek routine screening for diseases such as breast and cervical cancer. The potential to gather practitioners from a wide range of relevant medical and paramedical specialities (psychiatry , internal medicine, dietetics, sociology) was emphasised in the fonnation of this interdisciplinary network. Furthermore, the research functions of the clinic were considered important, in particular research into the short and long tenn effects of oestrogen therapy (Notelovitz, 1981). At a meeting held during the Second International Congress on the Menopause in 1978, representatives from eight different countries reported on menopause clinics established in their respective nations (Notelovitz , 1981). These representatives, all from first world countries , discussed the roles, functions , scope and problems encountered at their respective clinics. Areas of imponance in menopause clinics were thought to be service provision, dissemination of information , source of patients for menopause research and a means of teaching medical and paramedical staff. A question raised at this meeting that remains controversial today was whether problems associated with menopause should be the domain of general practice or the specialised hospital menopause clinic. The ideaJ proposed by the congress was that primary care of the menopausal woman should be the province of general practice. However, this should preferably be under the aegis and co-ordination of the tertiary hospital menopause clinic. Paramedical services were thought to be most appropriate in providing supportive care, such as peer counselling , education programs on exercise and nutrition and group support. Referral cases, involving women with difficult or complex: problems , were thought to be best handled by specialist tertiary menopause clinics. Together with providing the full range of medical expertise . the specialist menopause clinic would \"direct the research and educational components Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic of menopause care\" (Notelovitz, 1981, p. 157). Centralised care and control remained the focus of these clinics. Establishing menopause clinics in Australia Implicit in the official account of the establishment of menopause clinics is the notion of menopause as a problem requiring a solution. In naturali~ing menopause as a problem, these official accounts overlook the construction of menopause into a problem. Glossing over this process of problem construction, the official account tells how menopause clinics were set up to address the problems of menopause . The local account tells how, following Utian's lead, the first menopause clinic in Australia was established by Jean Hailes at Prince Henry's HospitaJ in Melbourne in 1971. Jean Hailes was a general practitioner interested in issues of women's health. In particular, Hailes saw a need to provide help for women experiencing problems at the time of their menopause. There was considerable resistance towards the use of hormonal therapy from general practitioners at the time, and issues surrounding menopause were not being satisfactori ly addressed (Notelovitz, 1981). A menopause clinic was thus established with the aim of addressing these needs. This clinic was set up initially as an outpatient clinic ofa large tertiary teaching hospital. Women could attend the clinic without referral from their general practitioners and the clinic was in heavy demand. Subsequently . other menopause clinics were opened in other states in Australia, primarily within large teaching hospitals. The clinics were established by predominantly female medical practitioners interested in the area of menopause . These practitioners often looked for assistance from other female colleagues in the operation and maintenance of the clinics (K. Orr, personal communicat ion. February 2, 1994). In addition to the establishment of menopause clinics, many community health centres and women's health centres began to provide education programmes as well as management consultations for women on issues related to menopause . 65 66 Ch. 4: SiEuating the menopause clinic Menopause clinics continued to be established in the 19905 with thls decade seeing an increased number of private menopause clinics. Many scholars have previously pointed to the burgeoning menopause industry (Coney. 1991; Worcester and Whatley, 1992). The privatisation of menopause clinics for purposes of profit seeking certainly contributes to this 'industry' . With the public health cafe system under increasing econonUc pressures, medical practitioners sought to establish private menopause clinics to overcome the financial and bureaucratic impediments presented within the public health system. Sharing many ofthe goals of their public counterparts, private clinics sought autonomy in providing menopausal management to women. With the increased shift towards prevention strategies in menopausal management, in tenns ofHRT and lifestyle changes, private clinics have emphasised their role both in terms of acute and preventive care. The corporatisation of private menopause clinics aims to provide not only good quality of care, but menopausal care which comes in a convenient and efficient package. Probing the trajectory To portray the founding of menopause clinics as a linear progression obscures the social and historical factors which influenced it. The straightforward trajectory of 'menopause-as-problem' to 'menopause clinicsIHRT-as-solutio n' overlooks the many factors which have constructed this seemingly linear model. Disrupting this linear trajectory, I examine some of the many factors which have influenced and contributed to the establishment of menopause clinics. In addition, a closer examination of this linear trajectory highlights the point that the setting up of menopause clinics was only one of many possible outcomes . An imponant contributOr to both the establishment and the operation of menopause clinics was the development ofhoffilonal therapies. Although the use offemale sex hormone therapy for the treatment of menopause was first promoted in the late 1930's (Oudshoom , 1994), it was not until the late 1960's that the interest in hormone therapy peaked (Ripper, 1994). HRT is currently promoted as a combined treatment and prevention package, used for both the treatment of acute menopausal 67 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic problems as well as the prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease. Despite the seamless acceptance of the development of this hormone package as a solution to the problem of menopause , Oudshoom (1994) challenges the straightforwardness of this proposition . Oudshoorn remlnds us that in its early development , the therapeutic value of hormonal therapies was largely unknown and these preparations were \"drugs looking for diseases\" . As I elaborate in the next chapter, the soaring use and sales of oestrogen in the late 1960s can be partially attributed to the work of Robert Wilson and his book Feminine Forever (Wilson, 1966). Wilson promoted the use of oestrogen replacement therapy (ORT)25 as the all encompassing remedy for the associated ills of menopause , in particular as a means of combating aging in the menopausal woman. Pharmaceutical companies maintained intense promotion of their products during trus period. In addition to the advertising of hormone therapy were many influential books and promotional campaigns . Coney (1991) outlines the widespread campaigns in both Britain and the United States to promote honnone therapy. The use and sales of oestrogen rose until 1975 when reports were released of an association between oestrogen use and endometrial cancer. Oestrogen sales plummeted until the early 1980' s, when progesterone was added to the hormone regimen (combined hormone replacement therapy -HRT) to circumvent the endometrial cancer risk26. However, the addition of progesterone resulted in both an associated increased risk of breast cancer as well as adverse side effects in many women. By the early to mid 1980s these assertions of risk were being counteracted by claims that HR T had a beneficial effect on bone loss caused by osteoporosis, as well as acting in the prevention of heart disease (Wren, 1990). =~ Substitute ORT (Oestrogen replacement thcrap)') with ERT (Estrogen replacement therapy) ror US spelling. ~(, Progesterone functions to protect the endometrium or lining of the uterus. This homlOne acts on the proliferative endometrial cells by inducing a secretory change in the cells, thought to protect the endometrium rrom carcinoma (Wren. 1985). 68 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic Women, seeking treatment in the 19705, complained about the reluctance and refusal by general practitioners to prescribe hormonal therapy for problems associated with menopause . Women seeking help were therefore faced with limited options and welcomed the establishment of menopause clinics where honnonal therapy was readily available. The reluctance of general practitioners to prescribe hormonal therapies during this period needs to be examined within the historical context of this time frame. During the 19705, alanning reports linking the use ofhonnones with cancer and increased mortality were circulated . Hamanal preparations such as diethylstilboestrol (DES) and the oral contraceptive pill were associated with increased mortality rates and adverse effects. Concerns raged not only with women users but also with prescribing medical practitioners . Despite the intense promotion ofHRT, the conflicting repons about its risks, together with concerns over associated hormonal therapies resulted in a sense of mistrust and confusion on the part or practitioners. As J discuss in later chapters, primed by these experiellces, many general practitioners still maintain a reluctance to prescribe hormonal therapies, expressing concern about the unknown long term effects of these preparations. Women seeking information during this period were faced with a noticeable dearth of available material. Taking the 1976 edition of the Boston Women's Health Book Collective 's Our bodies, Ourselves as an example of the \u00abphysiological Bible for contemporary feminists\" (Posner. 1979, p.l87), Posner points out that only 12 of its 383 pages were devoted to discussion about menopause (Boston Women's Health Collective, 1976) 27. Predominant feminist concerns during this period centred around contraception and abortion. child care provision and workplace equity - concerns relevant to the young feminists of this time. The growing concern with menopause by feminists today follows the aging of the feminists of the 70s. As I discussed in Chapter I, feminists played a vital role in drawing attention to issues about menopause and raising debate about the way menopause is understood and managed. Prominent in the 1970s editions of the Boston Women's Health Book :' This is in contrast to the currenl 1992 issue of The New Our hI/dies, Our.l\u00b7elves which dcvOles 43 of its 751 pages to discussions aboul menopause and ageing (Boslon Women's Health Colleclive , 1992) Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic Collective is the argument that negative stereotypes associated with menopause are the result of societal devaluing of ageing women. The notion of menopause as a social construction is emphasised in the critiques of a youth-oriented culture. Although the use of oestrogen is discussed for the management of serious physical discomforts of menopause, it is the positive experiences of menopause which are highlighted . Emphasis is placed on restoring women's self worth through lifestyle changes and self valuing in an eHart to combat society's devaluing of older women. 69 Tantamount in importance to the developments in hormonal therapy, was the formation of the Women's Health Movement and rise of the feminist movement. The early 1970s saw a burgeoning interest in women's knowledge about their own health. Concurrent with the fonnation of consciousness raising groups, self help groups were established to enable women to gain more knowledge about their bodies and health needs. Such self help groups were part of a growing Women's Health Movement struggling to gain access to health practices, in particular those dealing with reproductive practices and abortion. In 1974, Australia's first community women's health centre, the Leichhardt centre, was opened (Broom, 1991). This was closely followed by many similar centres in other states in Australia. These centres provided primary gynaecological care, counselling , health education and promotion, training as well as fulfilling an advocacy and health policy lobbying role. Although employing a different ideological base to that of menopause clinics, the setting up of women's health centres specifically geared towards the management of women's health served as an important precedent to the early menopause clinjcs. As Broom (1991) points out, the Women's Health Movement was dissatisfied with the health care being provided. A holistic health care system was sought and women's health activists advocated that women take charge of their own health and promoted services which allowed them to do so. Many of the women's health centres established during the late 1970s and 1980s which provided assistance for menopausal women were adamant followers ofa holistic approach to therapy, refusing to prescribe hormone therapy (K. Orr, personal communication , February 2, J 9(4). A1though this has changed in some cases, there are many centres today which Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic remain critical of hormone therapy and advocate its use only in restricted cases (Birnbaum, 1990). 70 Throughout my field work, many menopause cli~ic practitioners , who were often initially family planning clinic practitioners, pointed to similarities between menopause clinics and family planning clinics. Just as the initial introduction ofHRT was met with some reluctance by many general practitioners, the introduction of the contraceptive pin in the early 19605 in Australia was also met with apprehension. Family planning clinics during this period served as specialist centres with expertise and experience in the management of contraception, including the use of the contraceptive pill. Until the contraceptive pill became more widely used and increasingly prescribed by general practitioners , family planning clinics maintained their specialist status in contraception management , However, these two types of clinics differed in the institutional context in which they were established. While menopause clinics were largely established within hospital institutional settings, family planning clinics were, and remain. predominantly community based. The Family Planning Association, first known as the Racial Hygiene Association , has its roots in the eugenics movement, which accounts for its community base (Siedlecky & Wyndham , 1990). Despite these institutional contextual differences , both menopause clinics and family planning clinics served as specialist centres before their respective expertise became more disseminated throughout genera1 practice. As with women's health centres, family planning clinics served as another type of precedent for the establishment of clinics specifically designed to address issues of women's health. Locating the establishment of the menopause clinic in a socia-political context highlights factors which both contributed to and influenced the setting up of clinics world wide. The establishment of menopause clinics does not follow a simple linear problem-solution trajectory . As J elaborate in the next chapter. menopause has been constructed as a problem, and the use of HRT is only one of many possible choices for the management of menopause . Despite the intense promotion of honnone therapies, the use of HR T was met with much trepidation and reluctance from 71 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic general practitioners, feminists and the Women's Health Movement . Other means of managing menopause were proposed and HRT was, and remains, only one of many alternatives . The establishment of menopause clinics therefore was not straightforward, but entangled within many important social and historical factors. Examining the linear trajectory of <rnenopause-as -problem ' to <menopause c1iniclHR T -as-solution' makes visible these influences and highlights that the use of HR T and the setting up of menopause clinics, particularly hospital based outpatient clinics, were only two of many possible outcomes . Sketching the menopause clinic I have previously described the menopause clinic as a heterogenous network. Given this conceptual outline I now wish to colour in the contours and sketch a picture of the menopause clinic. The picture I sketch is edited by my partial perspective and is limited to the points I wish to highlight. Despite these limitation s I attempt to give an entree into the world of the menopause clinic. In order to do this it is necessary to consider two categories of clinic. public and private clinics, which vary considerably in terms of physical and sociaJ architecture . Public menopause clinics Public menopause clinics operate as outpatient clinics in large tertiary referral hospitals. Referrals are not required with some public clinics and women attend by making an appointment directly. Other public clinics, however, require a referral from another medical practitioner prior to attendance. For one or two sessions per week, the clinic space becomes the domain of the women and the medical practitioner s who come to discuss menopause. For the remainder of the week other specialties inhabit the space. The resident owners however, are the nursing and administration staff These staff inhabit the clinic throughout the whole week and perform the necessary articulation work to ensure the smooth running of each of the different specialty clinics. Despite what the doctors may think, it is these constituents who set the rules about appointment times, where instruments are kept and how the clinic operates on a day to day basis. Having learned to be a perceptive reader of such social settings, it is these people that I tum to for advice, assistance and 72 Ch. 4: SituaLing the menopause clinic direction during my field work in the clinic. The often invisible work performed by these 'ancillary' staff contributes to the co~construction of the menopause clinic. I am reminded oftills by one ofthe nurses, \"You have to train the doctors all the time about what goes where and how things are done here\", Entering through a maze of corridors, a feature of all public hospitals, the visitor to the menopause clinic is faced with a central reception area, walting area and what first appears to be a room of closed doors. One is able to examine the waiting area very closely due to the often lengthy times spent there. Most have the expected fixtures -neutral coloured walls, uncomfortable chairs, dated magazines, noticeboards with yellowing notices, perhaps a water fountain, or possibly even an automatic coffee machine, which, if you are lucky, is working. Infonnation provision, an important objective of public hospitals and menopause clinics. is in the fonn of pamphlets displayed haphazardly on racks and sometimes a video recorder playing an information video in the comer. Due to the shared nature of the space, infonnation can be obtained not only on menopause but also on pregnancy, family planning, diet and other areas relevant to the other predominantly women's health services which share the clinic space. Waiting times can vary from 15 mins to 3 hours -not conducive to a lifestyle based on tight schedules. Long waiting times, a common complaint of women attending public clinics, is explained in several ways. The consulting doctors, although attempting to adhere to appointment times, argue that some women require more time than others to discuss problems and receive adequate explanations . Women attending clinics where they feel that the doctors are compassionate and take time to listen to their problems , accept these explanations thinking that they too may require more time than has been allocated . Many of the consulting doctors are obstetricians as well as gynaecologists and often face the difficulties of being called away to attend unexpected births; this takes priority and although some may have other doctors covering for them, this means that the clinic often runs behind time. The waiting area 71 Ch. 4: Siruating the menopause clinic therefore, is a place where women sit and look, and more often than not, talk28, This talk invariably turns to menopause . Problems, therapies, opinions of doctors and clinics, and helpful strategies are shared between women. The same women may see each other on a regular basis, every 3, 6, or 9 months, and follow each other's lives at these meetings. For some women, this may be their only opportunity to discuss their problems with other women sharing the same or similar problems. Some women eagerly take up this opportunity~ others retain their anonymit y and remain silent. However, many women comment during the interviews with me that the waiting areas should be rearranged to facilitate this talk and sharing of infonnation . The women, in particular those living in rural areas who may have travelled for 4-5 hours to attend the clinic, want tea and coffee making facilities. The women place a claim over the waiting area (after all, they spend a lot of time there) and would like to reconstmct this space into a social arena conducive to shared talk. The waiting room, 1 suggest, is an important site for knowledge construction about menopause , where women discuss and negotiate understandings about menopause. For some women attending one particular clinic, this site is a familiar one. It is the same site where they sought family planning advice during their reproductive years, ante natal checks during pregnancy and now menopause management during midlife. Adding to this sense of familiarity, some women have seen the same doctor throughout these different periods and they comment on a sense of both institutional and practitioner trust which influences their return. The space lined by numbered doors reveals separate consulting rooms upon closer exanUnation . In some clinics these are limited to two rooms, others have up to eight rooms. These doors separate the public and private spheres of the menopause clinic. The public space -the waiting area, reception and specimen collecting area is kept divided from the inner sanctum of the consulting room where private problems are revealed, clothes removed, examinations performed , information exchanged and treatment negotiated . Women talk about being anxious before their consultations , unaware of the procedure s to be performed and uncertain if they will receive help for :'~ In the waiting area, I am told by women that [ am a welcome distraction to the tedious waiting when I approach them about participatin g in the study. 74 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic the problems which bring them there. Most women who attend menopause clinics do so to seek help for problems which they have associated with menopause . For most, this is usually the third or fourth attempt at seeking help after unsatisfactory dealings with other practitioners, most notably their general practitioners. For many women their problems may be of a few months duration but for some women, their problems have plagued them for years. For one woman I spoke with, this time spanned 37 years, before she or her general practitioner associated her problems with menopause. A smaller proportion of women attend the clinics simply to obtain infonnation and have options explained to them. From the names being called out and a scan of the faces of the women in the waiting room, Anglo Saxon women are predominant . However, with the availability of interpreter services in these clinics, a small number of women from ethnic backgrounds are present, usually with a woman mend or relative beside them for support. One clinic, conscious of the large number of Greek women in their community , allocates special sessions with Greek female practitioners where Greek women can attend. The occasional woman with a physical disability serves as an important reminder that ali women go through menopause . The doctor opens the door, calling out the name of the next patient. Understandably , it may take two or more calls before the woman responds given the noise of the video and the talking, the lengthy waiting time and the uncertainty of which doctor the woman will see this time. The private space of the consulting room is typically arranged with a desk, two or more chairs, examination table, instrument trolley and sink -all the necessary accoutrements required for a typical medical consultation. I did not seek to enter this private sanctum and sit in on the consultations but from the interviews I formed a picture of the proceedings . The obligatory greetings are made, the woman's history consulted and reason for visit established . This is not always satisfactory due to the women not always being able to see the same doctor, insufficient time available for a thorough reading of the history prior to the consultation and sometimes due to the woman's fragile emotional state, and her difficulties in articulating her problems . Some women adopt strategies to overcome this and during the interviews , show me notebooks outlining all their consultations , tests performed , medications and results. This consulting room is the site where 75 Ch. 4; Situating the menopause clinic women are examined and undergo a variety aftests requiring the privacy of the inner sanctum -pap smears, breast examinations and pelvic examinations. It is also the site where women divulge sexual and emotional problems, which often require much time and sensitivity on the part of the practitioner to manage. An array of specialised service provider sites surround the physical space of the public menopause clinic. Nearby is a specimen collecting area where most commonly, blood is drawn and then sent offfor diagnostic pathology tests and determination of hormone levels. Scattered through the hospital are sites affiliated with the menopause clinic which provide referrals, services and testing procedures. For public clinics, these may comprise of other outpatient clinics located within the hospital maze where women are referred for psychiatric consultations or perhaps cardiology consultations; mammography and bone density screening centres may be based within the hospital or in some cases may be external to the hospital; pathology centres are usually located within the hospital network; the hospital pharmacy is on site and women can obtain their prescribed medications including hormonal therapies free of charge, or at a much reduced price than available privately; general practitioners and other practitioners from within the hospital refer women to the clinic for menopause consultations; medical records provides a centralised record keeping service of the women's histories; and information advisory services offer further information . As I will elaborate in later chapters these services comprise some of the multiple collectives of the menopause clinics and each actively works in the co-construction of the menopause clinic arena. Private menopause clinics Externa lly, the private clinics stand in sharp contrast to the public clinics. The overwhelming picture which greets you upon entering is the smooth image of corporatisat ion -fashionable muted colours, soft lighting, designer magazines , and receptionists who call you Mrs. This obviously has the desired effect on the clients attending, evidenced by Marg's comments after attending a private clinic: Marg: 1 think it's very nice; it's very discreet. The clinic itself I think is lovely. It's very nice; it gives you a nice feeling. It's not dark and dingy and awesome or anything like that which is lovely because I think you need that ~ you know, it's nice, and light and airy. Marilys: Is it what you expected? What did you have in mind? 76 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic Marg. I don't really know. I suppose I sort of shut that off. I didn't really know. I didn't know if it was a hole in the corner sort of clinic or what. 1 was very impressed when I came in to the building and saw where it was. Before you even enter the site, this 'nice' image has started to take shape. The clinic's shiny promotional pamphlets urge you to step into the 90's, albeit still echoing the call for autonomy of the Women's Health Movement of the 70s. \"The days of someone else telling us how we should feel and what we do or don't need are over. We can take our health and well being into our own hands\" claims the private clinic's promotion. The other participating private clinic cites its aims as \"providing an opportunity for women to learn medical and non medicaJ options available to them, thus enabling them to make an infonned decision on how they wish to deal with the menopause \". The message is clearly on taking responsibility for your own health -with the help of the clinic. The clinics direct their promotion to women of the 90s -the women of the corporate world29. Echoing this corporate world is the sales pitch of convenience and efficiency through the provision of a number of different specialised services in one location. In reality this is not quite true as in some cases women need to go to another site to have the tests performed but, nonetheless, the marketing emphasises the centralised arrangement and management of these different services. At one clinic, where women are willing to devote an entire day to attending the menopause clinic, sessions can be arranged to encompass an initial consultation with a general practitioner, a bone density test, a mammogram, and any other tests. followed by a second consultation in the afternoon with the same doctor to discuss the results of the tests taken earlier that day -a veritable one stop menopause convenience store. The private clinics are active in their promotional campaigns . Information seminars are held regularly in both urban and rural areas. Open days and lectures by visiting specialists are promoted . These sessions are very successful, attended by as many as 19 Despite this pitch towards corporate and working women. it is questionable whether these women arc respondin g to this message. AHhough it was not the aim of this study to gather statistical demographic data. through observation and interviews . it appears that many women attending private clinics do so on a 'once only' basis. This particularly applies to those women who do not present with serious problems but are responding to prevention measures against osteojXlrosis and heart disease during menopausc . 77 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic 700 women per session. Unlike most of the women attending the public clinics who hear about the clinic from female friends or relatives, the women attending private clinics are usually there as a direct response to the clinic's promotion . This promotion is not only directed to the general community but also targets employees of organisations which traditionally employ women -schools, clothing industries etc. To facilitate this corporatisation, these clinics typically employ someone from a marketing or business background with skills in effective promotion. The waiting room of the private clinic does not stay in your mind -not much time is spent there -20 minutes on a bad day. The receptionist asks if you would like a cup of tea while waiting. Fulfilling their educational obligations, pamphlets on menopause and other women's health issues are scattered on the coffee table. A video recorder is available if you wish to see a menopause infonnation video. Women do not talk to each other as much here. unless they have corne from a rural community and are making a day of it. Then they really appreciate the chat, the cup of tea and biscuit and the well appointed toilets close at hand. The consulting rooms are larger and more comfortable here. It feels more private. There is the necessary examination table, instrument troiley, handbasin, chairs and desk. Within the clinic are 1,2, or 3 sessional general practitioners with an interest in menopause and women's health. All the general practitioners are women, a point promoted in clinic advertising . The marketing people in the clinic have done their homework. They have found, like I did with most of the women I talked to, that women seeking help to manage menopause prefer to speak. to a woman doctor. Women practitioners are perceived to be more understanding , empathetic and better able to put you at ease. The remaining consulting rooms are reserved for the speciaJislS who work one session weekly or fortnightly . These are gynaecologists, endocrinologists . and physicians, all with expertise and experience in menopause. The gender hierarchy becomes evident -most of the specialists employed are male, a point noted by many of the women attending the clinic. Complex or difficult cases are referred to the specialists by the general practitioners in the clinic. These cases may be women who could require hysteroscopies (endoscopic examination of the uterus for assessment of abnonnal bleeding) or women who need fine tuning of their 78 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic honnone balance. 1 was told by each private clinic that they had previously employed a psychologist but for various reasons were not currently doing SO~ although they would consider it again if the need arose. In each clinic, bone density assessments are performed on site. Although not owned by the clinics, the bone density service providers have clear affiliations with the clinic and are active participants in the menopause clinic network. The expectation at each of the two private clinics is payment immediately following consultation. Fee charges are therefore made clear when appointments are made. The fees charged vary between the two clinics. In both clinics this entails the women clients paying between 33% -50% of the costs after obtaining Medicare rebate.30 Service fees are an obvious influencing factor on which groups of women can attend private menopause clinics. Although most women justify their attendance with claims that their health is important to them, they quickly add that they are aware of the cost and this is an important consideration when deciding whether to return to the clinic. A quick scan of the waiting room reveals a largely Anglo Saxon group of women with few women from ethnic backgrounds. This is despite the city in which these clinics are located priding itself on its multicultural diversity. The clinics claim that they are aware of this problem but interpreter services are costly and this would only add to the clinic's expenses. No women with obvious physical disabilities are noted in the waiting area of these private clinics. \"\" Medical consultalions in Australia arc funded b~\u00b7 the Australian Government Medicare system. to which alltax-payers conlribute a percentage of their income. Medical practitioners can choose to charge the standard Medicare rate. at no cost to the patient. or practitioners may choosc to charge Slandard Australian Medical Association (AM A) fees. These fees. set by the AMA arc higher than the standard Medicare rebate fee. resulting in the patient being out of pocket the difference between the Medicare rebate and the fee charged. For example. in one private clinic during the period of the fieldwork (19')4). a consullation v.'1.th a general practitioner cost $A83.95 (standard AMA fee). Of that. the woman can ex-pect La have a Medicare rebate orSA54.95. and is out ofpockcl $A28.05 (3]%). For those women who arc Government Health Card holders. onJy the Medicare rebate fee of SA54.95 may be charged and the woman is not out ofpockcl. However. it is the c1inic'schakc whether to charge standard AMA fees or whatever fees tllCY consider to be reasonable . Fees charged by consulting clinic specialists are considerably h.igher than those charged by clinic general practitioners . However. the same systcm of rebate applies. This system of rees in private clinics stands in sharp contrast to the public clinics where no. or minimaL cost is incurred by women consumers . it should also be noted that Medicare rebate is not available or is limited on some services such as bone densitometry . 79 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic Locating current menopause clinics In 1967, the first menopause clinic was established with clearly defined aims and objectives . This clinic, located in a tertiary hospital, attempted to set a model for the establishment of further clinics. Almost three decades later, the public hospital clinics re-affinn the same aims and objectives -service and information provision in an interdisciplinary network, education, research, and specialist referral. In addition to these aims, the public hospital clinics in this study also specify particular objectives - opportunity to provide interprete r services to enable a larger population of women to seek help, fostering community debate about controversial issues related to menopause , and education directed to both general practitioners and medical specialists who manage midlife women. In the 1990s. private menopause clinics were established. The staff at these clinics see their role as bridging the gap between what can be offered by the community general practitioner and the specialist public clinics. Service and information provision are high priorities of these clinics. However, un1ike the public clinics. private clinics add ongoing primary health care to their role. According to private clinic practitioners and managers. in their favour is the ability to provide convenience -short waiting times and centralised services. Unlike busy general practitioners in the community , general practitioners in menopause clinics feel that they are able to spend more time with women, a factor they (and the women) claim is of utmost importance . In addition is their expertise in the menopause area, with many of the practitioners having completed further studies in menopausal health. Summary The aims of this chapter were two fold. First, I examined the establishme m of menopause clinics both internationally and in Australia. The setting up of menopause clinics and the administration ofHRT as a solution to the problem of poor services in the management of menopause follows a simple linear progress trajectory . This type of trajectory obscures influencing factors and deletes the possibility that this outcome was onJy one of many possible outcomes . I drew attention to the questioning and reluctance of general practitioners during the 1970s with regard to prescribing hormone therapies , the influence of the Women's Health Movement in providing 80 Ch. 4: Situating the menopause clinic alternative management strategies for the management of menopause , and the different kinds of understanding of menopause put forward by feminists. Despite the intense promotional campaign for HRT and an initial widespread use, its uptake was thwarted by associated cancer risks, concerns with long term effects on the part of both practitioners and women consumers, and the growing apprehension voiced by many feminists in constructing menopause as a problem of harm one deficiency . Writing these factors back into the text of how menopause clinics have come to be established muddies the clear linear trajectory. The second aim of this chapter was to provide a sketch of menopause clinics. A picture of both private and public menopause clinics has been painted to give context to the arguments which follow in subsequent chapters. These descriptive accounts not onJy set the scene, but act as a reminder that this is a study grounded in empirical data, dealing with interactions and processes of the people and things which constitute the menopause clinic. Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency Chapter 5 -Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency Introduction &1 The 'official' account of menopause, with which I began this thesis, tells the story of menopause as a problem ofhonnone deficiency with HRT as the solution. Despite the widespread prevalence of this account and its current taken for grantedness, this particular notion of menopause is not pre existing, not is it the onJy possible understanding of menopause. Historically, there have been many competing constructions of menopause. In this chapter, I trace these different constructions of menopause over various historical periods and follow how they have come to shape the current understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . In tracing these different constructions of menopause, I am indebted to the conceptual work of Ludwik Fleck (1979). In Genesis and developmel1l oj a scientific/act, Fleck outlined how the modem concept of SpirochaeJa pa/lida originated as the causative agent of syphilis. Fleck described the different historical understandings of the concept of syphilis and uses this analysis to suggest how older ideas about syphilis shaped the new conceptualisation of syphilis as an infectious disease caused by this particular spirochaete . Fleck's thesis was that the current concept of syphilis is attainable through a study of its history, and that within new conceptions are pre-existing notions which act as continuities. Although these links do not explain the success of a particular concept or why it was taken up, they do provide a means of understanding how old ideas facilitate the acceptance of new concepts. Tracing the history of syphilis, Fleck showed the historical development of \"thought styles',)] through which previous ideas shape the uptake of new ideas. 11 Ficek introduced the concept of collective knowledge through the idea or \"thought collectives\". which he defined as a \"community of persons mutually cxclmnging ideas or maintaining intellectual interaction\" (Fleck. 1979. p.J9). For Fleck, 'truth' in science was what has been collectively accepted by the thought collective: facts are collectively created. \u00b7'Thoughl styles\" arc thcrefore the particular style of thinking that has been collectively accepted by the thought collective. Fleck's theory of knowledge suggests that pre-ideas can become scientific facts as they arc transmitted and modified through various thought collectives. 82 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency Using Fleck's notion, I study the history of how the concept of menopause as hormone deficiency has come to be stabilised. In particular, I examine the competing concepts of menopause over historical periods, together with the prevailing social attitudes, professional forces and economic considerations of the time. Analysing these different historical conceptualisations of menopause highlights any continuities which have shaped our current understanding of menopause. However , in performing this analysis my aim is not to give a history of ideas account. I am not suggesting that following the development of these different concepts will show that HRT has come to be used because it was deemed to be the best solution for the treatment of menopause . Rather, I trace the changes in knowledge systems about menopause and examine how these influenced the taking up of the particular understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . The different conceptualisations of menopause do not follow a single linear process unfolding along a predetennined pathway, nor is there a clear delineation of one concept superseding another. 32 Rather, the emergence and decline of these different accounts are historically contingent. Fleck (1979) reminds us that as technologies and developments become stabilised . the course of their development becomes rationalised and schematised based on earlier work. In the current seamless account of menopause as honnone deficiency , the messiness of this developmental process is erased. Writing the messiness back in enables an analysis of how technologies and ways of understanding menopause have come to be established . In this chapter, I emphasise two key points. The first point is that menopause has not always been understood in terms of harm one deficiency . To highlight this, I trace competing understandings of menopause through different historical periods. There are many different discourses through which menopause was constituted as a problem, not just of hormone deficiency , but as a problem of stagnating bodily fluids, as a gynaecological disorder and as a psychological disturbance . Contemporary understandings of menopause as a social phenomenon add to these competing .12 Berg (1995b), in his study of medical discourses in the postwar medicalliteralure, traces different historical conceptualisations of medical practice. Berg makes the point that these different discourses do not follow a linear process of gradual enlightenment but rather are a set of disparate and often conflicting conceptualisations . R) Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency conceptualisations. My second point is that the conceptualisation of menopause as a problem acts as a continuous link through these different notions of menopause. 1 suggest that this link has shaped the current understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . Tracing these disparate notions of menopause highlights that the current understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency was not an inevitable outcome, but rather, one of many possible outcomes . Constructing menopause as a problem The discursive production of menopause as a disease spans at least two centuries. Consistent over this period is the negative portrayal of menopause as a disorder. a problem of biological origin and later a deficiency. Concurrent with the construction of menopause as a disease has been the reciprocal development of remedies -purging practices, surgical interventions and hormonal therapies . These different ways of understanding menopause were heavily influenced by prevailing sociaJ and cultural attitudes as well as competing professionaJ forces. As I illustrate in the following sections, knowledge construction about menopause was, and remains, an active, dynamic process with competing ways of understanding jostling one another. Menopause as 'stagnation of the monthly flow' Descriptions of Western women's menopausal experiences date back to the \u00b71 8th century. Although use of the term 'menopause' did not occur until the early 1800's, experiences associated with menopause were described in texts dating from the 1700's. Accounts from the early 18th century portrayed the body as a surface on which signs must be read. As Duden points out, the 18th century body was opaque, a \"place of hidden activities\" (Duden, 1991, p. 106). The body's internal activity was read from signs either appearing on the body or emanating from within it. It was not until the \"opening up of a few corpses\" (Foucault, 1973) and the advent of routine autopsies that there came to be a new type of medical gaze requiring a different kind of reading of the body's signs. Medicine of the early 18th century was characterised by the internal body's unlimited transformations and metamorphoses . 84 Ch, 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency In this corporal space in wruch it circulates freely, disease undergoes metastases and metamorphoses . Nothing confines it to a particular course. A nosebleed may become haemoptysis (spitting of blood) or cerebral haemorrhage; the only thing that must remain is the specific form of blood discharge. This is why the medicine of spaces has, throughout its history, been linked to the doctrine of sympathies-each notion being compelled to reinforce the other for the correct balance of the system. (Foucault, 1973, p. II) This notion of the metamorphosing body explained the interpretation of how fluids could assume different fonus, yet retain some essential quality. Duden (1991). in her accounts ofa doctor's patients during 18th century Germany. reports on the complaints of women patients of the time. Women complained of loose bowels if their periods ceased, or of bloody sputum if their menses was irregular; other reports include breastfeeding women who, when their milk had dried up, suffered from diarrhoea \"that looked whitish like milk\" (Duden, 1991, p.1 08). The monthly menses were seen as a necessary and healthy means of the body to rid itself of any disorder, including evil humours (Greer, 1991). With the cessation of the menses, this means of excretion stopped and instead it was thought that the blood was retained and stagnated within the body. Duden reports on a case in which there was \"stagnation of the monthly flow\" (Duden, 1991, p. 139). The blood was thought to have collected and clotted inside the uterus, with the possibility of this \u00abclot\" developing into a hardening or growth which could then spread throughout the body. Consistent with this understanding , the remedies used included \u00abluring the blood; showing it the proper paths from the outside\" (Duden, 1991, p.112) To enable this excretion, remedies such as leeches applied to the genitalia were used, together with directional phlebotomies (letting of blood from a woman's ann), or the use of emmenagogues (substances used to promote menstrual flow) (Wilbush, 1988). During this period, women's menopausal experiences were clearly positioned as problems requiring remedies. Wilbush (1988) cites from a guide produced for women during the 18th century, The Ladies' Physical Directory or a Treatise oj all the Weakne.\\ses, lndi.\\positions alld Diseases peculiar to the Female Sex from Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficienc y Elevell Years oj Age 10 Fifty or Upward,. The following quote describes women's experiences of menopause : 85 And here it will not be amiss to touch upon the Disorders that most Women labour under, when being between forty and fifty years of Age, their Courses begin first to dodgeB and at last to leave them; for then they are frequently troubled with a Severe Pain in the Head and Back, and about the Loins; oftimes also with Cholick Pains, Gripes, and Looseness , at other Times with Vapours to a Violent Degree; likewise feverish Heats, wandering Rheumatick Pains and general Uneasiness. (A Physician 1739, p. 21 cited in Wilbush, 1988, p. I) This quote from an anonymous 'physician' defined the experiences of menopause first as symptoms located within a medical context, and second as problems - 'disorders that most women labour under'. Displaying a sense of medical entrepreneurship, this same 'physician ' offered treatment for these disorders by way or \"letting\" eight Qunces of blood, fcHowed and \"Consolidating the costly sum of fifteen shillings and sixpence (Greer, 1991, p. 228). Wilbush (1988) goes on to suggest that women during this period increasingly sought the help of physicians for their \"female ills\". This is consistent with the Enlightenment project of this period which advocated trust in science and medicine . The increasing number of women who sought medical help should also be framed against the increased longevity of European women during this period. During the period 1480-1479 , women at 20 years of age were only expected to live until 49 years of age. This is in contrast to the period in question, 1730-1779, where the life expectancy of women was 64 years and was to later increase to 74 years for the period 1880-1949 (Hollingsworth , 1965 cited in Wilbush, 1988, p.2). Although the concept of menopause was not yet named, the description of complaints associated with menopause s ituated menopause as a medical problem. This condition was read as a problem in which the nomaJ order of regular menses 11 Wilbush (]988) claims that the term \"dodge\" was used widely during the late 17th to early I Yth centulJ'. The pre-menopause was known as the \"dodging time\"\" referring to the irregularity of menses. Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency was halted, resulting in the possible metamorphosis of menstrua l blood into a stagnant mass. This historical period advocated 'solutions' by way of blood letting and herbal substances to induce the menstrual flow. This conceptua lisation of menopause as a problem was to continue well into the next century. Menopause as gynaecological disorder The early 19th century saw a burgeoning interest in the climacteric . Thirty theses on the climacteric were presented in French universities34 during this time. and the tenn 'menopause ' was coined (Wilbush, 1988). De Gardanne submitted a doctoral dissertation in 1812 titled Dissertation sur les avis a donner aux femmes qui entretll dans I 'age critique (Dissertation on the advice to give to women entering the critical phase))~. It was in this work that the term cmenespausie' was first used and later shortened to 'menopause '\" (Wilbush, 1988). Throughout the 19th century, interest in menopause continued to grow. The portrayal of menopause and the c1imacteric37 as a problem was maintained. as was its location within the medical domain. This positioning of menopausal management and treatment within the province of medicine is a continuous thread which runs through the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries . The practice of medical interventions for the 14 Medical interest and awareness of the climacteric was considerably higher in Fnmcc tlmn in other parts of Europe. This is evidenced by the number of works on the climacteri c which arose from France. It was also common for British and US physicians to complete postgraduat e study in France where they were presented with studies on the climacteri c (Greer. 1991). l~ de Gardannc was also nOled to have written the first book entirely dedicated to the menopausc in IRI6. in which he fully described the syndrome he called 'Ia mcnespausie' (Wilbush, I ()KK). :v; of the tenn 'menopau sc' was derived from the Greek 'mcno' meaning month. relating to periods and the Greek 'pause' meaning cessation (Wilbush . 19KR). 1\" The tenn 'climacteric' dated the use of the tcrm . menopause , and was used by de Gardanne in his original thesis title 'I'age critique'. 'Climacter ic' is derived fTom the Greek work referring to the critiC<l1 period (Greer. 1991, p.2.5). 'Climacteric' was used. and continues to be . used. imerchangeabl} ' with 'menopause '. Technically . the climacleric is a morc general term meaning the period before the menopause and spanning alleast until the first year after the menopause (peri menopause) . This contrasts with the more specific 'menopausc', defined as \"the pcmlanent cessation of menstruation resulting from loss of ovarian fOllicular activity\" and the 'post menopause', which covers the time frame of 12 months after the last period (Khaw. 11)92, p.250). Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of homlone deficient:) ' treatment of menopause, albeit very different kinds of interventions, became increasingly normalised over this time. 87 Medical theory of the 19th century was based on the physiological law of 'conservation ofenergy '(Ehrenreich & English, 1973; Martin, 1987}. This law comprised two postulates , both significant not only in the treatment of women's health problems but also in advocating women's social roles. The first of these postulates referred to the fixed amount of energy within the body which was transferred between different organs or functions. Development of one organ was done at the expense of another as the organs competed for the body's vital energy. The second postulate was that reproduction was central to a woman's life and the sexual organs could control the woman's body (Ehrenreich & English, 1973). This conservation of energy theory had major implications for women's social role as well as the medical treatments women received. Women pursuing intellectual interests were thought to be jeopardising their reproductive capabilities , with obvious implications for the lack of opportunities for women in higher education (Ehrenreich & English, 1973). Against this central focus on women's reproductive organs was a barrage of competing medical opinions regarding treatments and remedies (Greer, 1991). Traditional remedies competed with the tools and practices of the growing gynaecological profession . Women's <nature' and psychology were thought to be detennined by her reproductive organs. Hysteria and insanity were therefore thought to be the result ofan abnonnality ofa woman's reproductive organs. Interlaced with this were the social mores of the times with regard to sexuality and the association of menstrua l disorders with sexual practices considered inappropriate for women. A prominent ' ladies' doctor of the mid 19th century, Edward john Tilt, was a British physician who also completed postgraduate study in Paris with many of the principal medical climacteric authorities . Tilt authored many texts on women's reproductive health and was much sought after by women who could afford his expertise (Delaney , Lupton, & Toth, 1988; Greer, of 88 Ch. 5: ConstrucLing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency remedies for \"female ills\" included reduced dietary intake, iron and potassium syrups, and abdominal belts. However, Tilt preferred the remedies of the 18th century for the treatment of climacteric problems . Common practices were bleeding either by venesection, when up to 12 ounces of blood were let from the arm of the woman patient, or through the application of leeches either behind the ears Of at the nape of the neck (Delaney , Lupton, & roth, 1988, p.216). More pleasant remedies were visits to mineral springs of fashionable foreign resorts which \"combined varied medicated waters with good society and a country abounding in beautiful scenery\" (Greer, 1991, p.237). These remedies were obviously reserved for the more wealthy members of society. Competing with the traditional remedies of physicians such as Tilt, were the tools and expertise of the gynaecologists, whose profession was rapidly expanding . Ripper (1994), p. 108) argues that the gynaecological profession became the gatekeepers of knowledge in relation to women's reproductive health during this period. Delaney. Lupton, & T oth (1988, p.216) discuss the treatments used by Andrew Currier, a prominent American gynaecologist , who accused physicians , such as Tilt, of being \"bleeders, pukers and purgers\". Gynaecologists such as Currier were avid proponent s of surgical techniques and advocated total removal of women's reproductive organs. In 1801, the speculum was introduced as a diagnostic tool to visualise the cervix (Wilbush , 1988, p. 5). The development of other gynaecological technique s together with the introduction of anaesthesia in the mid 19th century (Arney, 1982, pp. 4-5) ensured the continued involvement of the b'Ynaecological profession in the menopause arena. The use of these diagnostic tools were instrumental in the provision of 'menopau sal checkups' by gynaecologists (Wilbush , 1988, p.S). Menopause -sexuality suppressed Despite the importance placed on women's reproductive organs as the essence of women's nature during the 19th century, clear distinctions were made between reproduction and sexuality . Women were urged to focus on reproduction and 89 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency femininity and to repel any notion of sexuality. It was widely believed that \"sexual disorders\" resulted in disease, exemplified by the supposed association between tuberculosis and prostitution. In particular~ masturbation was noted be harmful, pathological and detrimental to women's health (Ehrenreich & English, 1973, p.31). Women going through the menopause who experienced sexual desires were considered <unnatural' and were urged to refrain from any sexual activity. Advice about menopause given to Australian women of the period states:, There are undoubtedly cases in which the perturbed stale of the sexual as well as the nervous system gives rise to an unnatural excitement of the sexual desires at this epoch, but that such is rarely the case is the uniform testimony of those whose experience qualifies them to testify on the subject .... It is evidently the design of Nature to protect the nervous system of the woman from the tempestuous excitements which she is unqualified to endure without damage not only to the system as a whole, but to that portion of the vital economy chiefly involved in the act. There is no doubt but that sexual congress at this time is a very common cause of intensifying all the numerous inconveniences and physical, mental and nervous ailments which are attendant upon this period, and hence continence is to be not only recommended but enjoined as one of the most essential hygienic measures by which as safe and rapid transit through the turbulent period of sexual decline may be insured. (Kellogg, 1908, p. 380) Women of the 19th century were urged to surrender any sexual inclinations and submit to <the call of Nature' to enable their passage through this period (Wilbush, 1988, p.6). Any deviation from this would not only be unnatural and abnormal but would lead to some pathology. On a wider social scale, it was believed uncontrolled female sexuality would lead to the de-stabilisation of the family and thus the social order (Nathanson , 1991, p. 216). Female sexuality was seen to detract from reproduction , regarded as women's primary function. Women's reproductive role was considered to be the basis of the family structure which in turn was the foundation of society itself In this regard, giving in to one's sexuality had implication s not only for the individual woman and her health, but for society as a whole. 90 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency Menopause as psychoses Consistent with the emphasis placed on women's reproductive organs was the explanation that women's psychological and emotional disturbances were also under the control of the reproductive organs. As Barker-Benfield (1975) notes in his analysis of gynaecology in late 19th century America, \u00abIt was woman's ofwomen's mental disorders\" (p.283), Conditions ranging from irritability to hysteria were attributed to gynaecological disease (Ehrenreich & English, 1973, p.30). Women's sexual transgressions were constructed as the source of society's ills. Gynaecologists were therefore positioned not just as physicians, but also as restorers of society's morals through their treatment of women's sexual disorders. Such was the authority of the gynaecological profession that they enrolled cases of psycholohrical disorders under their umbrella of surgical treatment s. Initially used in 1858 in the United States. clitoridectomies were the first surgical operation developed to treat women's mental disorders (Barker-Benfield, 1975, p.285). However, oophorectomies (surgical removal of the ovaries) were a far more widespread intervention. First used in 1872, female castration continued to be used in the US for psychological disorders until 1946 (Barker-Benfield, 1975, p. 285). Hysterectomies were used from 1895 and were used as an alternative or in addition to female castration for the treatment of psychoses (Barker-Benfield, 1975, p. 286)\"'1'1. The association of menopause and mental disorders was reported in many of the earlier texts on the climacteric dating back to the mid 1800s. It was not uncommon for women diagnosed as insane due to the climacteric to be institutionalised and, as Greer (1991) notes, '\"their temporary aberration forever complicated by institutional IX Barker-Benfield points OUllhat during this period of devc!opment in gynaecological surgery. it was the wives and daughters of rich. or at least middle class. men who could afford this surgery. However. poor women were used as guinea pigs in the development of [his surgery. Destitute immigrant women and black women in the US were treated free on the proviso that they be subject [0 surgical experimentation . Cases of poor women enduring up to 30 operations over a three year period were reponed in the development of these surgical techniques (Barker-Benfield. 1975. p. 288-89). 91 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem ofhonnonc deficiency psychosis\" (p.273). Psychiatrists in the early 1900s described the condition of involutional melancholia (Rosenthal, 1968). This psychotic condition associated with the climacteric continued to be included in the official American Psychiatric Association 1968 edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Memal Disorders, edition 2 (DSM-II) and was described as \u00ab,.a disorder in the involutional period and characterized by worry, anxiety, agitation, and severe insomnia . Feelings of guilt and somatic preoccupation are frequently present and may be of delusional proportions\" (American Psychiatric Association , 1968, p.J6). It was not until 1979 that involutional melancholia was officially removed from the American Psychiatric Association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders with the recognition that the incidence of depression in women was no higher during the climacteric than at other periods of their life39 (Weissman, 1979). Menopause as a psychoanalytic disorder Adding to the cacophony of voices in the menopause arena of the early 1900s was the contribution ofpsychoana1ysts. Following the lead of Freud, Helene Deutsch, a German psychoanalyst working from the 1920s onwards, further developed the construct ion of menopause as a psychoanalytic disorder (Delaney, Lupton, & Toth, 1988, p.220). Using the framework of psychoanalysis, Deutsch read the depressive signs of menopause as a symbol of grief and 1055.40 Women were said to be grieving over the loss of reproduction with the cessation of menstruation . Having lost the capability of producing life, they were left only with their impending death. Tantamount to their loss ofreproduct ion was women's loss of femininity (Swartzman & Leiblum, 1987). Deutsch saw menopause as a fate which women must endure. With the loss of femininity and reproductive capability, Deutsch likened I') The association of dc:pression and menopause is discussed in later chapters. A high proportion of women participating in this study spoke about depression and claimed to be depressed: this is in contrast to the medical reports which suggest thm depression is no higher during menopause than at Olher periods of a woman's life. -1<' I suggest that the notion of the \"empty nest S)'ndrome\" stems from this psychoanalytic conceptua lisation of menopause and rnidlife. The term, still used today to refer to women's feelings of loss and grief when their years of nurturing children are over. characterises the grief and loss which Deutsch made the focus of her work. Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency the complaints of menopause to those of puberty and used puberty as an analogy to the climacteric, orthe 'dangerous age' (Greer, 1991, p.276). 92 The social and political forces of this period are clearly exemplified by the responses to a book, titled The Dangerolls Age, which was written in 1910 by Karin Michaelis , a Danish author. The book narrated the reflections and letters of Elsie, a 42 year old woman, as she approaches menopause . In her analysis of the book and its responses, Eddy (1992) outlines the social and political concerns of the period. The narrative of The Dangerolls Age described Elsie's retreat into isolation and despair as she faced the loss of her sexual appeal. Elsie's letters to her friends revealed the emotional upheavals she was undergoing. as well as that of her friends. The book became a best seller and was translated into a dozen languages . The release of the book provoked major criticisms and caused great controversy throughout Europe. Michaelis was accused of portraying women as hysterical and irresponsible. Claims were made that the book spoke only to the bourgeoisie and was not representative of the working woman going through menopause. Eddy (1992) writes of the vocal opposition towards Michaelis and her book from the suffragette movement who were campaigning for women's right to vote. The book, the movement felt, gave their opponents ammunition to support the contention that women were emotionally weak, were unable to cope and at certain periods, were incapable of making responsible decisions . Michaelis responded that both physical and emotiona1 symptoms of menopause should be acknowledged and help sought from both the family and the medical profession . Michaelis's plea for tolerance for women who do suffer emotional disturbances during menopause was largely ignored, except for a small number of supporters from the medical community (Eddy, 1992). Nonetheless , the term The Dangerous Age continued to be used, reappearing again in 1949 in Simone de Beauvoir 's The Second Sex (Beau voir, 1984), the narrative of which described de Beauvoir's intense anxiety as she confronted the ageing process. 9) Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency Menopause as hormone deficiency In discussing the disparate historical conceptualisations of menopause, I stress that these were all possible potential alternatives to our current understanding of menopause . The notion of menopause as hormone deficiency was not an inevitable process. The following section is therefore notably detailed to highlight the contingent nature of this particular understanding of menopause which was to become so widespread. Despite its growth in popularity. the development of the concept of menopause as hormone deficiency is not unilinear but is fraught with uncertainties, challenges and ambiguities . I emphasise this point in highlighting the influences of the many social, material, and professional forces which come together to shape this particular understanding of menopau se. Df!Velopment o//emale sex hormones The work of Vir chow in 1848 challenged the claim that the source of feminine essence resided in the uteri of women. Virchow advocated that the uterus was only of secondary importan ce to the ovaries, which he claimed was the site of feminine essence (Oudshoom, 1994, p.8). In 1905, a physiologist, Ernest H. Starling, introduced the theory ofhonnones (Oudshoom, 1990, p.244). The introduction of the concept of honnones resulted in a paradigmatic knowledge shift from the organistic model (uterine or ovarian organs) to a biochemical model (Ripper, 1994). However , this shift should not be understood as a sequential step towards gradual enlightenment. Rather, as Oudshoorn (1994) demonstrates in her tracing of the social history of the development of sex hormones , the shift was a result of the collective actions and interplay of many different social b'TOUps. Oudshoorn identifies the major actors involved in the development offemale~ ' sex hormones and the processes used in creating networks which led to the widespread marketing and sale of hormones worldwide . \u00b711 See Oudshoorn (1993) for an explanation for the lack of success in the development and promotion of male se:-.: hormones . Ch. 5: Construcling menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency The period 1925 -1940 came to be known as the \"heroic age of reproductive endocrinology\" (Clarke, 1989). Despite this period being characterised by the growth of sex endocrinology, the therapeutic use of organ hormonal extracts dated back to the 1890, (Oudshoom, 1993). Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard was renowned during the 18905 for his claim of physical and sexual rejuvenation after injecting himself with extracts of guinea pigs' and dogs' testicles. Organotherapy increased in popularity in the late 1800s -early 1900s, with the medical use of extracts from a wide variety of animal organs. However. the use of these extracts remained controversial, with many charges of quackery made against those who practised organotherapy (Oudshoom, 1994, p.84-84). 94 Oudshoorn (1994) traces the development of Organon, a Dutch pharmaceutical company which was, and remains, a leading producer ofhormanal drugs. In order to divorce itself from previous accusations of quackery with regard to organ extracts, Organon went to great lengths to establish itself as a scientific company. [n its effort to legitimate itself and its products, Organon actively promoted and emphasised the scientific character of its products. The company directly addressed the medical profession rather than the public, producing a scientific journal (\"The Hormone'), as well as establishing close professional links with medical practitioners and university scientists (Oudshoorn , 1994, p.85-87). In sharp contrast to the current understanding ofHRT as a specific solution for the problems of menopause, the first female sex hormones released in 1925 had no known therapeutic value; they were fundamentally \u00abdrugs looking for diseases\" (Oudshoorn, 1994, pp.89, 108). The links Organon forged with medical practitioners were put to good use as the phannaceutical company attempted to set up clinical trials to establish the therapeutic utility of their female sex hormones . Clinical testing of the honnones continued concurrently with their marketing . Gynaecological clinics provided a beneficial institutional context with which to perform clinical trials. Not only did the clinics provide gynaecological expertise and a ready supply of women patients with a variety of gynaecological disorders but, more importantly, the clinics were a ready source of raw material for hormone production . Female urine was used 95 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency during this time as the source of hormonal extracts, and Organon provided the clinics with free hormones in exchange for raw material and continued co-operation (Oudshoom, 1994). With very limited information available regarding the therapeutic value of hormonal drugs, these products were promoted as universal drugs. Not only were they promoted fOT the use of menstrual disorders and menopausal complaints, but they were also indicated for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and melancholia as well as dermatological diseases, all thought to be related to ovanan dysfunction (Oudshoom, 1994, pp. 92-93). Widespread use of hormones in the 1920s and early 1930s was limited due to their expense and lack of availability. It was not until the late 1930s that a synthetic fonn of oestrogen, diethylstilboestrol (DES)\", was produced (Bell, 1987, p.S36). This alternative was cheaper and more readily available than its non synthetic counterpart , and also initiated the development of the contraceptive pill (McCrea, 1983). In 1943, an oestrogen extract was isolated from the urine of pregnant mares. This substance was duly marketed under the trade name ofPremarin43 and was to become one of the best selling drugs for its parent company, Ayerst (Ross, Paganini-Hill , Subir, Chao, & Henderson , 1988). Competing conceptualisations The period ranging from the 1920s-40s saw the introduction of the concept of hormone deficiency diseases. Oudshoom (1993, p.16) remarks that in the 1930s an increasing number of diseases of older women were attributed to low levels of sex \u00b7I~ First introduced in 11)38, DES was widely used until 1971 for menopausal complaints and complications of pregnancy (Oudshoorn, 11)9~, p.I07). In 1971 reports of associations with cancer led to its decline (Bell, 1989). on The trade name, Premarin . was derived from its source (II regnant mares' urine). Although this source of oestrogen was not as potent as synthesised oestrogen, it was found to have less side effects. Prcmarin continues to be used. today_ and is widely marketed as a natural oestrogen . CurrenLly. many fonnulations of HRT are promoted on the basis of their being ~natural \", thus more rc..1d.ily accepted in our Western nature-conscious sociely. The term \u00b7'natural\" is an ambiguous onc as many of the \"'natural'\" fonnulations currently available are laboratory synthesised replicas of the body's hormones (Westmore. 1994). Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem ofhonnone deficiency hormones during menopause. The concept ofhonnone deficiency resulted in many complaints being treated with hormonal drugs, although these ailments had not previously been considered as symptoms of illness. This notion of hormone deficiency was not restricted to menopause. Organon's first product, released in 1923, was the pancreatic honnone, insulin, used for the treatment of diabetes. The concept of diabetes as a hormone deficiency disease was generally well accepted, creating a precedent for the eventual acceptance of menopause as hormone deficiency (Oudshoom, 1993)\"'. 96 There was no clear delineation of the notion of menopause as a hormone deficiency disease superseding previous conceptualisations of menopause. The understanding of menopause as psychosis continued well into the 19705. Rosenthal documents the success of electroconvulsive therapy (EeT) in the treatment of involutional melancholia; he comments on the duration of this illness being shortened from 1-4 years to 3-6 weeks with the use ofECT (Rosenthal, 1968, p.23). Oestrogen therapy was also used for involutional melancholia during the 19205-305. However, Rosenthal , in sununarising reports of this period, suggests that there was no significant improvement of the depressive symptoms with oestrogen therapy. Despite the initial enthusiasm of psychiatrists for this endocrino logical therapy. review of the available evidence showed no foundation for an explanation of honnone deficiency for involutional melancholia (Rosenthal , 1968, p.26). Of interest was a report in 1948, documenting the value of a combined gynaecological and psychiatric clinic for the treatment of gynaecological disorders considered to have a psychoneurotic aetiology (Snaith & Ridley, 1948). The proponents of this clinic advocated that in addition to a gynaecologist , such clinics should also include a psychiatrist and a psychiatric social worker. The coming together of seemingly disparate groups of psychotherapists , psychiatrists and gynaecologists served not only as a predecessor for the interdisciplinary model of the menopause clinic, but also reflected the ambiguities in the conceptua lisation of women's menstrual disorders. Although the \u00b71\u00b71 It is interesting that during my interviews with menopause clinic practitioners. rererence was often made to diabetes. These practitioners often used diabetes as an analogy to menopause. linking them both as honnone deficiency diseases \\.\\-ith well r(X;ognised honnonc replacement therapies . . l I ! , 97 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency concept of menopause as hormone deficiency was to become the dominant understanding of menopause . I stress that this was not an inevitable, logical outcome. Competitive and merging professional forces, ambiguities in the use ofhonnonal drugs and prevailing social attitudes all influenced the different notions of menopause I have outlined. Concerns, cancer and controversies [fthe 1920s and 30s was the era of hormonal drugs searching for a disease, then the search ended in the 19605. Using great entrepreneurial panache, Robert Wilson, a leading American gynaecologist. engineered the widespread promotion and sales of oestrogen therapy. Aptly fitting the description of ' heterogeneous engineer', Wilson successfu lly enrolled the support of pharmaceutical companies, fellow gynaecologists, reputable scientists as well as the media in his promotional campaign (Wi [son, 1966). Wilson persuaded the pharmaceutical industry to grant him $1.3 million to establish the Wilson Foundation in ] 963 for the purpose of promoting the use of oestrogens (McCrea, 1983), Wilson and his wife and frequent co\u00b7author, Thelma, wrote prolifically on the merits of using oestrogen. Sensing the need to gain popular acceptance, Wilson published the widely read book Feminine Forever in 1966 (Wilson, 1966). Wilson supported the claim that oestrogen could restore women's feminine essence which slowly declined during menopause . Wilson advocated the use of life long oestrogen replacement therapy to avert the symptoms of ageing which included physiological symptoms, osteoporosis, hypertension. depression, \u00abmenopausal negativism \", and imbalances to the nervous system (Wilson, 1966; Wilson & Wilson, 1963). This pro-oestrogen campaign enrolled many supporters who in the words of Sandra Coney were \"missionaries for oestrogen\" (Coney, 1991, p.161). In Britain for example, was Wendy Cooper, an avid lay supporter of Wilson. Cooper (1975), in her very successful book No Change, discussed her personal use of oestrogen 'as insurance against future trouble'. Support was also received from the budding profession of sex therapy. In his popular book. Everything you always wanled to know ahoUl sex, Reuben (1969) reinforced Wilson's portrayal of the decaying menopausal woman requiring the forces of 98 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency oestrogen therapy to rescue her from disease and decay. Wilson's entrepreneurial efforts, together with widespread promotion by the pharmaceutical companies, were doubly rewarded with remarkable sales of his book together with sales of oestrogen dramatically increasing by 187% from 1965-75 \"Premarin, the most widely used form ofERT, was ranked as the fifth most widely prescribed medication during 1970-1974 and was ranked second, behind Valium, in 1975\" (Swanzman & Leiblum, 1987, p.16). The rise of oestrogen use and sales was to suddenJy plummet in 1975. There were many factors which contributed to this drop in oestrogen use. Paramoun t in the decline was the release in 1975 of two major epidemiolo gical studies linking oestrogen therapy and endometrial cancer Thompson , & Hennann, 1975; Ziel & Finkle, 1975). It is interesting to note that animal studies performed in the 1930s had reported a link between female sex hormones and cancer (Oudshoom, 1994, p.l 07). However , these early warnings were largely ignored on grounds that these studies lacked scientific soundness and were not applicable to humans (McCrea, 1983. p.IIS). Wilson, in his book Feminine Forever, actively discredited these reports from the 1930s, referring to the research scientists involved in these studies as \"inept\" and \"naive\" (Wilson, 1966, p. 135). The release of each new study on honnones and cancer reignited the medical disputes. Epidemiologists during this period became enrolled as authorities in the controversy . The debate in the late 19705 about the association of oestrogen use with endometrial cancer was fuelled by the controversial and alarming publications linking the use of other honnonal drugs with increased mortality and cancer. In 197], a link was reported between the use of the synthetic oestrogen, diethylstilboestrol (DES). and adenocarcinoma .4~ The reports showed an increased risk of cancer in both women who had taken the drug during pregnancy and their daughters (Bell, 1989, p.245). Adding to the debate were the numerous reports in the late 19705 concerning the .,~ As with the animal studies perfonned in the 11}30s linking oestrogen and cancer, Oudshoom (199'*. p.I07) documents reports from 1939 linking DES with breast cancer. These studies were also largely ignored. 99 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency association between increased mortality due to circulatory diseases with the use of oral contraceptives. Reports indicated that women who were current users or had previously taken oral contraceptives were at a much higher risk of dying from cardiovascular disease than non users of the pill (Bera!, 1976; Beral, 1977; Vessey, McPherson, & Johnson, 1977). The combined effects of these alanning findings alerted general practitioners and the women to whom these honnonal products had been prescribed. This resulted in the reluctance of general practitioners to prescribe hormonal drugs as well as a loss of confidence in the drugs by potentiaJ women llsers,46 Another major influence on the declining use of oestrogen during the late 19705 was the increased involvement of the Women' 5 Health Movement and the feminist movement around issues of women's health. As I discussed in Chapter I. the Women's Health Movement and their strong critique of oestrogen therapy contributed to the decreased use and sales of oestrogen during this period. The debates resulting from the release of these alarming reports called for mOTe carefully designed studies on the long term effects of oestrogen therapy. In response to this, research into the use of hormones and its association with cancer continued. Kaufen and Me Kinlay (1985) give a thorough coverage of the debate, highlighting that the primary purpose of the research of this period was to investigate the effects of oestrogen on diseases such as endometrial cancer, breast cancer and heart disease. The study of menopause was secondary to these concerns. In the late 1970s and early 1980s came reports advocating the use of progesterone in combination with oestrogen (combined therapy -HR. T) to oppose the effects of oestrogen on the lining of the uterus (Studd & Whitehead , 1988). However , this solution was to present a new set of problems . The new combined therapy was found to be associated with increased risks of breast cancer (Grady, Rubin, Petitti, Fox, Black, Ettinger. Ernster. & Cummings , 1992). In addition, the added progesterone was noted to result in adverse side effects for many women. As progesterone induces regular bleeding, ~(, This point is elaborated in later chapters. I discuss the continued reluctance of many general practitioners today to prescribe long term HRT, due to their concerns about its unknown long term effects. Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem ofhonnone deficiency women complained not only about once again having periods but also about being subject to new complaints from that which they had initially sought help. 100 As new findings were released about the risks an<;l benefits of HR T, deciding whether to take HR T was akin to adjusting a finely tuned balance. The use of oestrogen alone was associated with increased risks of endometrial cancer. The addition of progesterone to the regimen was thought to increase the risks of breast cancer. Counteracting these effects was the finding that oestrogen conferred some protection against heart disease. However. this was thought to be reversed by the action of the progesterone . The risks-benefits balance was again skewed with the association of HRT with the prevention ofosteopoTOsis (Grady, Rubin, et a!., 1992). Although this association had been acknowledged in the 19305 it was not until the early 19805 that interest in osteoporosis was renewed (Coney, 1991> p.169). Interest in osteoporosis has since soared. This has been largely influenced by many interested allies, including the dairy industry in its promotion of dairy foods to improve bone density, exercise and fitness industries to prevent bone fractures, as well as the heavy promotion of HRT by the pharrnaceuticaJ industry to prevent further bone loss. Menopause as a medical event A continuou s link between this understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency and previous notions of menopause is the reading of menopause as a problem, specificall y a medical problem. The historical conceptualisations I have outlined each viewed menopause as a problem, albeit in quite distinct ways. Additionally . this problem was located in a medical domain, shaping the development and use of medical intervention s for the treatment and management of menopause . These continuities have influenced the current location of menopausal management within the province of the menopause clinic -a medical site providing primarily medical interventi ons as solutions to the problem of menopause . My detailed elaboration in this section was to emphasise the contradictions and uncertaintie s in the introduction and development of the concept of menopause as 101 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency hormone deficiency. I stress that the development ofHR T was not just a clever solution to the problems of menopause . The discovery and dispersal of oestrogen was not a smooth path of gradual enlightenment. In introducing oestrogen on to the market, Organon released a drug with no known therapeutic value. Oestrogen was marketed as a universal drug with no specific purpose. It was the work of many different collectives which led to its eventual widespread use and its specification into a drug for the treatment of acute menopausal complaints and a preventive agent for osteoporosis and heart disease. This process was neither directed nor seamless. Controversies abounded with the release of reports of increased cancer risks and prevailing concerns about the use of hormonal therapies; professional forces were in active competition as challenges were made to their authority~ ambiguities became evident as the legitimate signs and symptoms of menopause were contested. What this process highlights is the precariousness of the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency and the use ofHRT as a solution. Neither HR.T nor the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency are pre given entities. Rather, they are the outcome of a dynamic co-construction . An artefact of concentrating my analysis on medical texts and its secondary sources is the impression that it is only through a medical discourse that menopause was constituted as a problem. The medical discourse certainly did construct menopause as a problem requiring medical intervention . However , as many feminist scholars have pointed out, what is omitted from these texts are women's lived experiences of menopause . What is ibJtlOred in this medical discourse is that for many women of different historical periods, menopause was, and remains, a nonnallife event associated with some discomforts which are just endured. [ stress that not all women going through menopause used or sought medical interventions , nor did all medical practitioners advocate the use of these therapies . Many women and practitioners insist that menopause is a nonnal life event, a rite of passage which all women go through. However , as I elaborate in Chapter 8, this notion of menopause as a life passage is not entirely divorced from the concept of menopause as a medical problem. Women's lives are organised around reproducti ve heaJth -pre-menarche, menarche, menopause , post menopause . This system of organisation draws on a 102 Ch. 5: ConslI'Ucting menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency different type of medicalisation -not necessarily a system advocating the use of medical therapies and interventions but a notion of a life cycle viewed in tenns of hormonal production and loss. It is not just the employment ofHRT, medical practitioners or other medical technologies that makes menopause a medicalised event. I suggest that even when menopause is seen as a normal life passage, the positioning of menopause in relation to other aspects of women's reproduction and hormonal production constitutes it as a problematic medical event. Contemporary constructions of menopause My aims in this chapter were two fold -to illustrate the contested conceptualisations of menopause and to show that within new conceptions are pre-existing notions which act as continuities through which new ideas are shaped. Using historical accounts of menopause, I have shown how the construction of menopause as a medical problem has shaped the current prevailing notion of menopause as honnone deficiency . This notion of menopause as a medical disease worked to link the disparate conceptualisations of menopause -the notions of menopause as a problem of metamorphosing bodily fluids, of gynaecological disorders, of psychosis and of honnone deficiency . However, these are not the only discourses through which menopause is constituted as a problem. Much of the feminist analysis of menopause, together with the lay literature on menopause , offer alternative discourses which construct menopause as a problematic event. As I discussed in Chapter 1, feminists of the 19705 were prominent in introducing and developing the constructivist notion of menopause. Feminists argued for the explanation that women's menopausal complaints were the result of societal devaluing of older women. Using a social constructivist discourse , menopausal women were positioned as victims of a patriarcha l medical and social system. The prevalence of a youth oriented society was thought to undermine the value and importance of the ageing woman. Menopause was constructed as a social problem, with menopau sal women as the victims of negative cultural assumptions about older women. 103 Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency In addition, there have been serious attempts to reclaim women's reproductive life cycle from medicine and reposition it in an arena of spirituality and conununity. Anthropological discourses emphasise menopause in relation to the community within which women live. This discourse challenges the Western medical emphasis on physiological symptoms during menopause. In studies of Japanese women, Lock (1991) and Rosenberger (1986) challenge the naturalness of Western meanings associated with menopause. The nearest Japanese equivalent term konenki does not translate into the somatic symptoms Western medicine has come to associate with menopause. Rather, it is more akin to a life cycle transition associated with ageing (Lock, 1991). In this regard, the characteristic Western medical markers used to identify menopause, such as hot flushes and night sweats, become meaningless. In studies of both Indonesian women and Mayan women in Mexico, menopause is predominantly characterised by the end of the cycle of child bearing rather than by somatic menopausal complaints (Beyene, 1986; Flint & Suprapti, 1990). Consistent among many studies of non Western cultures are the positive facets of reaching menopause . Amongst many cultures, including the Rajput women of India, Qemant women of Ethiopia, Bantu women of South Africa, village Thai women in the Khan Kaen province, menopause is seen as a 'reward' (Beyene, 1986; Chirawatkul, 1992; Flint, 1975; Toit, 1990). restricted by cultural taboos associated with menstruation , these women are free to partake in cultural activities. For many of these women, menopause and ageing are associated with prestige and esteemed status and this period of life is therefore welcomed . Cross cultural accounts are used to reinforce the social constructivist discourse, which positions menopause as a social problem. Studies of communities in which older women are valued and held in high esteem are used to advocate the repositioning and increased valuing of older women in Western societie~ . The current lay literature on menopause includes many attempts to situate menopause within a spiritual and psychoanalytic discourse. Women are urged to reassess their lives, to undergo a \"process of emptying and refilling that requires a new companionship between mind and body\" (Sheehy, 1992, p.149). This discourse Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency encourages women to find positive role models of ageing women whom they can emulate. Greer, in The Change, suggests role models for the ageing woman, 104 ... role models who are not simply glittering threads, some bones, some silastic and hanks of hand-knotted bought hair. If the world has dubbed you a crone, you might as well be one. There is no point in growing old unless you can be a witch, and accumulate spiritual power in place of the political and economic power that has been denied you as a woman. (Greer, 1991, p.8) Many proponents of this discourse argue that psychoanalysis is the key towards a menopausal woman's self -knowledge and wholeness . ]t is suggested that women can identify their behaviour patterns in terms of ruling goddesses. Having identified these patterns, women can cultivate and tap into the power of particular archetypes to enable them to gain spiritual power and take charge of their lives (Bolen, 1984; Downing, 1987). The hegemonic medical discourse is not the only one to construct menopause as problematic . The alternative discourses that I have outlined also constitute menopause as a problem. However, as I discussed in Chapter I. a common tendency of these discourses is to promote the idea of the menopausal body as separate from cultural values. social influences and material practices. A construction of menopause as an outcome of social, cultural or spiritUal forces leaves any notion of underlying biology untouched . This separation of corporeality and culture has been the subject of an increasing number of feminist critiques and analyses.47 Grosz (1990) argues against an automatic attribution of the biological body as naturaL Furthennore , Grosz proposes a textured body which interacts with cultural, social and psychological factors. Bioloh,), provides a bedrock for social inscription but is not a fixed or static substratum; it interacts with and is overlaid by psychic, social and signifying relations. The body can thus be seen not as a blank, passive page, a neutral ground of meaning, but as an active, productive , <whiteness ' that constitutes the writing surface as resistant to the imposition of any or all patterned \u00b71\u00b7 See Butler (191)0). Gatens (1988) and Grosz (1990) for an ex1ensive discussion of the body, panicu1arl y in relation to the social inscriptions of sexed bodies. lOS Ch. 5: Constructing menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency arrangements . It has a texture, a tonus, a materiality that is an active ingredient in the messages produced. It is less like a blank, smooth, frictionless surface, a page, and more like a copperplate to be etched. (Grosz, 1990, p.72) Tht:! type of analysis Grosz advocates refust:!s to separate social and cultural forces from the biological concerns of women's menopausal complaints. I argue that it is this type of analysis which is required to understand how knowledge about menopause has come to be produced. I am interested in the ways that material practices, social concerns and cultural influences act together with women's active, productive and textured bodies to generate knowledge about menopause. The employment of a feminist interactionist science studies type of analysis begins to engage with these issues and highlights the gaps left by other kinds of analyses. Summary Conventional historical accounts of menopause reduce and simplify the complexities of menopause into a standardised chronicle . This standardised account tells of the findings in the 1920s which identified honnonal decline as the underlying basis for menopause . In this account, HRT is heroically discovered to be the clever solution to this disease of deficient honnones. Despite its problems with associated cancer risks and serious side effects, HRT is nonetheless found to have beneficial effects which balance out such concerns. This type of account deletes the contestations and controversies which mar the picture ofHRT as the smart solution to the problem of menopause . It works to stabilise the notion of menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency and closes off any controversy about the hegemony of this understandin g and the use ofHRT as the solution. This type of reading does not seek to understand how this particular concept of menopause has come to be, nor does it attempt to investigate other possibilities for understanding menopause. Using Fleck's thesis, I suggest a different kind of historical reading -a reading which engages with competing conceptualisations of menopause, and with the contestations and controversies which stain the standardised account. 106 Ch. 5: Construcling menopause as a problem of honnone deficiency I have discussed different kinds of ways that menopause was conceptualised over various historical periods, as metamorphosing bodily fluids, as gynaecological disease, as psychological and psychoanalytic disorders as well as the prevailing understanding of hormone deficiency. What is evjdent from these notions are their historical and social contingencies . Clear delineations do not exist between these different conceptualisations; one type of knowledge system does not supersede another in clearly defined ways. Apparent are the challenges of different professional forces as they compete for legitimacy and authority~ the influence of social mores on the medical system are outlined; and the effects of scientific controversies and social concerns are illustrated. Despite these contradictions and ambiguities , continuous throughout these different conceptualisations of menopause are the notions of menopause as a problem, and the location of this problem within a medical domain, thus shaping the production of medical solutions as remedies to the problem. This is important in understanding how the management of menopause has come to be located within the highly specialised , medical site of the menopause clinic. This concept of menopause as a medical problem shapes the current location of menopausal management within a medical framework. Within this new configuration of the menopause clinic exists a grain of the previous conceptualisations of menopause and menopausal management . In addition to medical discourses , I examined alternative discourses of menopause. Feminist social constructivist readings of menopause look to social forces which they claim contribute to society's devaluing of older women, their low self esteem and experience of problems around menopause . Menopause is also constituted through alternative discourses , exemplified through cross cultural, spiritual and psychoanalytic accounts. Accounts of menopause , other than hormone deficiency do exist. However , these alternative readings of menopause are limited in their failure to engage with the materiality of women's bodies. with technologies and with the social-material practices of menopausal management. In the following chapters I turn specifically to these social-material practices and interactions and offer a different kind of analysis of menopause and its management within the menopause clinic. Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause cli~c Chapter 6 -Co-constructing the menopause clinic Introduction 107 The framing of menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency is co-constructed together with HRT as a solution to this problem. Both problem and solution are made relative to one another and in relation to a prevailing network of Social and material relations. The evidence for understanding menopause as hormone deficiency and HRT as unambiguously efficacious is not pre given, nor is their relationship pre determined. It is the work of the many different technosocial collectives ofthe clinic and the constructed understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency by other elements in the network that shape this particular understanding of menopause. In the previous chapter, I pointed to the continuities running through the different historical conceptualisations of menopause -the construction of menopause as a problem and its positioning within a medical domain. These continuities shape the construction of the menopause clinic as a site for the medical management of menopause. Just as the concept of menopause as honnone deficiency and HRT are not inevitable consequences of progress, the setting up of the menopause clinic is also not a pre given occurrence . The establishme nt of the menopause clinic is the result of the coming together and active construct ion work of disparate groups. Through heterogenolls and contingent processes of engineering , the menopause clinic is manufactured as the logical and rational site for menopausa l management . This is not because the menopause clinic measures up to pre given aims and criteria of success but because such objectives are built in conjunction with the clinic, thus becoming part of the naturalisation of the menopause clinic. The menopause clinic is constructed into a place where women go to have their menopausa l complaints managed, and relational1y , women's experiences are made into symptoms of hormone deficiency . In this chapter I use the conceptual tools of feminist interactionist science studies to identify the various disparate collectives of the menopause clinic and examine how these groups come together in the establishment of this network. Actor network theory 108 Ch. 6; Co-constructing the menopause clinic offers a conceptual language with which to decode the tacit patterns of network formation. Actor network theory's 'moments of translation ' act as conceptual signposts and offer a way of decoding the network of relations within the menopause clinic (CalIon, 1985). These phases are neither mutually exclusive nor temporally distinct: the phases overlap and are not distinguished by any clear boundaries . More important however in this analysis, is actor network theory' 5 use of semiotics. This semiotic approach is about how signs, entities and meanings are co-constituted . and about how actions are network effects. Using these tools, I explore the network of the menopause clinic. The menopause clinic comprises a web-like series of interrelations in which the various technosocial collectives act as nodes. The positions held by the women, physicians, HR T and other material technologies are not predetennined or inherently more or less powerful. I argue that the capacity of each of these groups to act within the menopause clinic is an effect of the network in which they are operating. The positions of each group are co-constructed and are constitutive of the set of interrelations in which they are positioned. My focus here is on how this system of relations has corne to be produced . In addition to the tools of actor network theory, I employ the concept of <boundary objects' (Star & Griesemer, 1989). I use the notion of menopause as honnone deficiency as an instrumental boundary object with which to examine how the various technosocial collectives, despite having very different interests and requirements , corne together and collectively establish the menopause clinic. The concept of menopause as honnone deficiency is imbued with a certain plasticity which enables it to be understood and adapted to the local needs of different technosocial collectives . This is of particular importance in allowing the coming together of very disparate groups. Despite its plasticity, this particular understanding of menopause is robust enough that it is able to act as a common interface enabling these groups to interact and work together. The understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency not onJy serves to fuse together the boundaries of the various disparate technosocial collectives but continues to act as a common link which binds these groups. However , lest I portray the menopause clinic as a coherent , seamless network, I hasten to add that this arena is fraught with ambivalence, contradictions and resistances . The menopause clinic arena 109 Ch. 6: Co-construcling the menopause clinic is in constant flux, with the many technosocial collectives operating within it abutting against one another, causing friction and much abrasion. These abrasions and abuttals are the focus of Chapter 8 where I explore the challenges . to the operation and the knowledge production of the menopause clinic. I begin with Nina's story. In telling Nina's story\", I explore and identify the heterogeneous groups of actors who together co~construct the menopause clinic arena. Nina's story brings into focus the relations of the various technosocial collectives of the menopause clinic and provides a starting point from which to explore how these different groups came together to collectively establish the menopause clinic. Telling Nina's story When f first approach Nina in the waiting room of the menopause clinic regarding her participation in the study, she hesitates and wonders whether she really has anything interesting to say. However, upon reflection, she thinks that if her parlicipation can help other women, then maybe yes, she will participate . We meet the following week on her day off work, at her home in an average middle class urban area. Photos of her three children fill the room. Nina is married, although , as she reveals later in the interview , her marriage is not as happy as it once was. Her husband doesn't understand what is happening to her -her mood swings, bouts of crying for seemingly nothing, not coping when once she did. He says she's not the same person she used to be and she agrees. Nina works as a receptionist in a large telecommun ications firm -a job she says she used to enjoy but now finds quite stressful because of her problems. Nina first started experiencing problems when she was 44, about 5 years ago. At first it was the occasional hot flush and heavy period. This was of no real consequence to her, not really interfering with her daily life. Then came the bouts of crying. She would find herself bursting into tears while walking down the street. She was moody, found it difficult to concentrate and would forget things -people at work 4~ Although Nina is a fictitious character. hcr story is based on. and is typical of, the many women with whom r spoke regarding their cX]Xrienees ofmcnopausc and.. more specifically. of the menopaus e clinic. 1I0 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic started to notice and ask what was wrong. It was also at this time that her mother died of breast cancer leaving Nina to manage her ailing father. Her three teenage boys were sUI/living at home then and bringing home their share of teenage anxieties and concerns . Nina put the depression down to the death of her mother\u00ad she had never been depressed before nor had any other member of her famify. This went on for several months, then stretched to a number of years. Nina first consulted her local general practitioner who assured her that she was worrying unnecessarily; a Jot of women her age go through this sort of thing, and she should just put up with it as it would soon pass. The onset of irregular heavy bleeding did not ease her worry nor her constant tiredness. She would wake in the middle of the night drenched with sweat and would have to change nightclothes sometimes two or three times a night. It reached the stage where her husband started to sleep in the spare bed. When she returned to her local general practitioner he had been replaced with another doctor, who told her that she was menopausal and needed HRT. She was prescribed oral HRT and leff feeling reassured that at least she now knew what was wrong with her and perhaps her problems could be resolved. However, she was disappointed to find that her bleeding worsened and she began to develop headaches and pain in her breasts - problems she had never had before. A different dosage of HRT prescribed to her still did not relieve her symptoms and she was referred to a gynaecologist for further investigation . Nina's gynaecologist changed her hormonal therapy from oral tablets to patches affixed to her skin through which the hormones were absorbed . Nina persisted with this form of therapy as it provided some relief. However , she developed serious skin reactions to the patches, resulting in raised welts on her buttocks where the patches were applied. Feeling close to despair, she was relieved when a friend recommended that she attend a menopause clinic. Nina's initial consultation at the menopause clinic was with a specialist gynaecologist. Although Nina's primary concern at this time was to investigate the abnormal bleeding following the commencement of HRT, a thorough history and examination of Nina's health status and lifestyle was camed out. With Nina's family history of breast cancer, and the association of HRT and breast cancer, a mammogram was performed. A pap smear was done to rule out cervical cancer and III Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic a hysteroscopy , an examination of the uterus using an endoscope , was performed to investigate the abnormal bleeding . Nina was prescribed a different formulation of HRT. However, this did not fead to much improvement in her symptoms . As Nina indicated to me in the interview , when things start to go wrong and you're feeling depressed anyway, everything gets worse and \"you don't know where you are\", The endocrinologist at the clinic who saw Nina at her next visit attempted to fine tune her hormonal balance by altering the dosages and composition of the hormonal therapy. Although somewhat more successful in alleviating her symptoms , this fine tuning took several months -months of anticipation and anxiety over whether or when she was going to get a period, monitoring mood changes, hot flushes, and night sweats, and recording any breakthrough bleeding. Nina's physiological problems began to improve but she still felt depressed and moody. Noting this at her next appOintment at the menopause clinic it was suggested she see the clinic psychologist to address her emotional problems. Nina didn't even know there was a psychologist at the clinic and felt a little uncomfortable seeing one. She was tired of being told for the last few years by both her husband and general practitioners that ''it was all in her head\" and felt that by seeing a psychologist , this notion would only be reinforced . However , she had one consultation with the psychologist. By this time her family's social problems were starting to be resolved and her anxieties began to lift. When I spoke to Nina, she was still attending the menopause clinic at regular 6 monthly intervals to monitor her health. Her physical and emotional health had improved and she now faced the dilemma of whether to remain on HRT. Nina's concern about the increased risks of cancer, in particular breast cancer due to her family history, were balanced against the relief of her menopausal complaints. She was reluctant to come off HRT in case the problems retumed. Nina was also acutely aware of the preventive benefits of HRT, particularly against osteoporosis . Fear of having osteoporosis was a major consideration in her weighing up of HRT. Nina continues to have regular pap smears, bone dens;tometries and mammograms and uses these surveillance technologies in her decision making of whether to remain on HRT. Nina talked to me about yet another consideration -weaning herself off HRT llZ Ch. 6: Co<onstructing the menopau se clinic with the use of naturopathic treatments and phytoestrogens .49 Nina intended to ask for a referral to see a naturopath on her next visit to the clinic as she had recently read about maintaining oestrogen balance with oestrogen containing foods. Nina anticipated using this as a means of weaning herseff off HRT and evenfuafly not having to use oestrogen at all. Identifying the technosocial collectives of the menopause clinic The menopause clinic arena has brought together many disparate technosocial collectives -their subgroups, practices/knowledge. tools and ideologies . Nina's story brings into focus some of the collectives operating within the menopause clinic. These include the professional groups of gynaecologists, endocrino logists, menopause physicians and psychologists. Menopausal women and the general practitioners who often refer women to the clinic are also central to the operation of the menopause clinic. Social-material practices have been vital in the establishment and maintenance of the clinic. Key material entities include HR.T, bone densitometry, manunography. various pathological diagnostic tests as well as investigative procedures such as ultrasound and hysteroscopy (endoscopic examination of the uterus). Technicians and operators of these various technologies, together with pharmaceutical companies funding research on HR T within the clinic, naturopaths and other alternative practitioners also hold membership within the menopause clinic arena. Clarke and Montini (1993) remind us that in the analysis of an arena, the concept of actors and technosocial collectives must be extended to incorporate those implicated by the actions of the arena but who may not be \u00abpresent\" or obviously visible within the particular site. In the case of the menopause clinic, such implicated actors include friends and family of the women attending the clinic, the media active in much of the community discussion ofHRT, health promotion campaigns, as well as the health care system urging women to take greater responsibilit y for their own health. In addition, there are various professional bodies which regulate medical practices, as well as the 4') PhY1.ocstrogcns arc plant and food producls found LO be high in oestrogen . These food sources include soy products. legumes. slone fruit liquorice. sage. basil and garlic, amongsl many olhers. II J Ch. 6: Co-conslructing the menopause clinic groups which govern the infrastructure of the institutions in which the clinics both , private and public, are located. Identitying the various technosocial collectives of the clinic highlights two primary features -heterogeneit y and fluidity. I have previously discussed the characteristic of heterogeneity within these collectives and the incorporation of human, non human and hybrid elements in my analysis. I return to this point in greater det~l in the following chapter. A notable feature of the technosocial collectives of the menopause clinic is their fluidity. First, the membership of the collectives are fluid in that multiple membership, participation and positioning is frequent~ an individual member of a technosocial group can participate in more than one group at any given time and can hold mUltiple positions within any given group/so Second, technosocial collectives are characterised by a fluidity of their boundaries. Technosocial collectives are formed through their commitment to action out of which shared perspectives emerge. [n the process of collective action, alliances are forged, intersections occur, and divisions transpire. Subgroups are formed, new technosocial collectives enrolled and others disbanded -all characteristic of a fluidity of movement and action. This point highlights the third understanding of the fluidity oftechnosocial collectives. The integral focus on action and practice of the technosocial collectives is the leitmotif of interactionist science studies, appropriate ly illustrated by the notion of fluidity, movement and flux. As I trace the processes in which the various tecbnosocial collectives have come together to establish the menopause clinic, I reflect on both the fluidity and heterogeneity of these assemblages . My overall focus in this thesis is on how menopause clinics have come to be established and made into robust interpolators of menopausal women. Specifically, this section concentrates on the articulation between the various technosocial collectives in the locale of the menopause clinic. As Nina's story exemplified, the technosocial collectives of the menopause clinic are a disparate and heterogenous collection - professional groups with very different investments and specialist expertise, material technologies serving varying purposes of diagnosis, surveillance and monitoring, women with very different needs and requirements , and organisations with commercial 114 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic as well as professiona l interests. The question I address here is how is it that these very different groups have come to work together to establish and maintain the menopause clinic? Tracing the establishment of the menopause clinic\" Making menopause into an endocrine problem The problematisation of menopause as an endocrine problem is paramount in understanding how the menopause clinic and HRT have come to be seen as its logical solution. In the previous chapter I explored how menopause came to be made into a problem of honnone deficiency. Here, I examine how menopause clinics were engineered to become the site in which to manage this endocrine problem. The building of the menopause clinic network was not straightforward but involved a complex series of negotiations and articulations. Callan (1985) reminds us that the phase of problematisation in network building is not a process of simplification which reduces the problem to a single investigat ion. Rather, this process brings in actors, both human and non human, defines their identities and positions within the network and establishes a series of potential linkages to enable the functioning of the network. Menopause clinics in Australia were not pre given entities. Indeed, AustraJia's first menopause clinics began not as menopause clinics but as endocrine clinics. During the I 960s-70s , both the Prince Henry's Hospital (PHH) in Melbourne (where Australia 's first menopause clinic was established in 1971) and the Royal Women's Hospital (RWH) had well patronised endocrine clinics which operated as outpatient clinics. As I discussed previously, this period in particular saw the widespread promotion of menopause as an endocrine deficiency disease, Medicine clearly positioned menopause as a disease of the endocrine system, together with diabetes, hyperthyroidism and other endocrine disorder s.~Q Situated within this endocrine .'i(' This classification of menopause under the rubric of endocrine disorders is clearly illustrated by medical textbooks from this period. For example. Davidson & Macleod (1973). a widely used medical tex1book in Australia during the 1970s. situated \"Disorders of the disorders . Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic framework, menopause was thus managed during this period alongside other hannana! disorders in Australian public hospital endocrine clinics. Sally, a long standing menopause clinic practitioner. comments on the origins of menopause clinics. At RWH, the menopause clinic started out of the endocrine clinic. They 115 already had an endocrine clinic. Henry Burger and Jean Hailes got together and initiated the clinic at PHH, because of their interest in the area. As far as R WH is concerned, there was a pre-existing endocrine clinic and menopause was becoming an increasing area in that endocrine clinic and they got more doctors involved purely for menopause. Now it's technically all the same clinic but the menopause clinic is busier than the endocrine side of the clinic. That's why the signs say endocrine clinic. The menopause area grew out as a subgroup of the endocrine clinic. (Sally, menopause clinic practitionersl) Women seeking help for menopausal complaints in the late 60s faced considerable difficulties. Medical practitioners were generally uninformed about menopause and its management options, or were reluctant to prescribe HR.T due to concerns about its associated cancer risks and unknown long teml effects. Many women I interviewed who had been attending menopause clinics since they were first established spoke of their fiustration when first seeking help for menopausal problems in the early 1970s in Australia. I came when I was first menopausal and I started menopause at 50, perhaps a little bit later, 52, and the menopause clinic was very new. In fact HR.T was not being given out to women and if you went to the doctor for it, he vetoed it. I went to one doctor, and he didn't think it was a good idea because it caused cancer. But I felt that my quality of life was more important than the quantity, so that's why 1 insisted. I had read that Jean Hailes had opened up a menopause clinic and I just rang up and said I wanted to come. So that's how I arrived to the menopause clinic in the early 70s. (Sarah) I had not told anyone how I was feeling except for one very close male friend and he said he thought it was menopause and that 1 should do something about it. So that's how I went to the doctor and the doctor virtually refused to put me on HRT. I had read about HRT being used in America and my friend had a friend who was a doctor. So he got a prescription from him and I got it filled. 1 'il Like Sally. many of the menopause clinic practitioners participating in this study had Lrained or worked with Jean Hailes who first established the menopause clinics at PHH and RWH. or were themselves actively involved in the setting up of these and subsequent menopause clinics. Following the regulation s of the etltics committees which approved this study, these participants cannot be named and Lhus pseudonyms are used for all participants . Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic 116 thought I had read about Jean Hailes and I thought if! was going to take this I want to have some supervision. I thought I can't get it second hand from a doctor] don't even know. So that's why I went to the menopause clinic. (Rebecca) Women and clinic practitioners alike testified to the lack of services available for menopausal women up until the 1970s. Rose, one of the clinic practitioners, comments on the paucity of menopausal services. It was regarded as somewhat mundane because after all everybody knew what menopause was, the periods stopped and the ovaries stopped working so what more was there to know. Initially menopause was not very well treated by general practitioners so there were a lot of women who felt they were not being very well served. They were looking for specialist attention. (Rose, menopause clinic practitioner) Women with menopausal complaints attempted to seek help within the existing endocrine clinics of public hospitals. Characteristically, menopausal women were referred to the women medical practitioners, such as Jean Hailes, who were working within these clinics. As demands from menopausal women grew and waiting lists lengthened, the hospitals responded by establishing specific menopausal services in the form of menopause clinics. Menopause clinics were all established by women doctors who saw a need. Jean HaiJes started off at the endocrine unit at PHIl. Women would come with what were patently endocrine problems to the endocrine clinic; they would be siphoned off, because the fellows were not frightfully interested , to Jean who was interested . it became a full time clinic. And then one was established at the R WH which Jean also established . The R WH had a 100% female board at that time, despite the fact that they had a predominance of male staff, and the female board was interested in establishing a menopause clinic. (Rose, menopause clinic practitioner) . The early menopause clinics were advertised widely in the media and through public seminars. The clinics were promoted as being directly accessible to menopausal women with general practitioner referral unnecessary (Notelovitz , 1981). Menopausal women responded enthusiastically and word spread in the community about the existence of menopause clinics. As women's demands became recognised , more clinical staff' were appointed to menopause clinics, many of which were made at senior levels. 117 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic As the patient demand on that menopause subgroup got bigger and bigger, more staff were appointed who were purely devoted to menopause. The hospital decided 5 years ago to create a position in charge of the menopause service under the endocrine clinic, which is a senior level hospital appointment. So they raised the level of the clinic by creating this senior level appointment. Because of the long waiting lists, more staff were appointed to cope with the demand. (Sally, menopause clinic practitioner) These senior positions are still in existence within the current menopause clinics, despite threats of budget cuts and potential closure of the clinics. Reworking menopause clinics as specialist sites In the early 70s, menopause clinics were established as sites to manage women's acute menopausal complaints. Responding to a paucity of services and a demand from women for menopausal management, the menopause clinic became the site in which these services were provided . In the intervening period from when menopause clinics were first established, there has been a shift in the problematisatio n of menopause and menopause clinics. Menopause clinics have been reworked from a solution to the problem of inadequate services. Currently. menopause clinics are sites for menopausal preventive care, information and education provision, specialist menopausa l management as well as meeting the 90s demand for convenience and efficiency. The enrolment of osteoporosis and heart disease, together with the promotion of HRT for the prevention of these diseases, has translated menopause clinics from sites of acute care to locales for prevention. In later sections of this chapter. I elaborate on the enrolment of both osteoporosis and heart disease into the menopause arena. For women seeking help for menopausal complaints in the 1970s, menopause clinics were one of the few options available for therapeutic menopausal management. Since then, general practitioners have become increasing ly aware and willing to manage menopausal complaints , providing additional sites for the management of menopause . The increased participation of general practitioners , together with the increased emphasis on preventive care and the promotion ofHRT as a prophylactic agent for osteoporosis and heart disease. has contributed to the reshaping of menopause and 11\" Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic menopause clinics. Menopause is no longer just a disease of deficient honnones characterised by hot flushes and night sweats. Menopause has been reworked into a period where women become increasingly prone to the dangers of osteoporosis. heart disease and breast cancer. This shift in the way m~nopause has been problematised has shaped both private and public menopause clinics into sites where women are offered management of these risks through preventive care. I think it is important about this age to do things like bone density. It's a good opportunity when their periods finish to come in here and say what do I do now to make myselfheaIthy for the rest of my life. It's a very good opportunity to try and put people on the right track about general health measures and I think bone density is something that is worth doing at that time. So if you find someone who is really low then you can say it might be a good idea to take oestrogen for 5 years so you don't fracture your femur at 75 but fracture it at 80. (Nancy. public menopause clinic practitioner) . This clinic is more along a preventive line~ most women want to know their health risks and their chance of getting osteoporosis which we can measure nowadays ~ the facilities are here. The service here is when they come, they can do everything on the same day which attracts a lot of people because they don't need to go anywhere else and people don't have the time to do things for themselves . The time is an important factor for them, (Sandra, private menopause clinic practitioner). The enrolment of new groups and their collective working of the menopause arena hus resulted not only in the translation of menopause into different kinds of problems, but has also shaped the practices and work of the menopause clinic. Women attending the early menopause clinic in the 19705 spoke of the delays in getting appointments to attend the clinics as well as the long waiting times once therc. Despite these difficulties , women flocked to the menopause clinics. The late 19HOs and 19905 has seen the privatisation of menopausal management and the commercialisation of the menopause market. Menopausal women are perceived as an eager and responsive market by private menopause c1imcs and phannaceutical companies . Rod, a manager of a private menopause clinic, makes clear that menopause has become a commercial enterprise . The phannaceutical companies in Australia are receiving more medication, fbr example the patch. The phannaceutical companies are spending money raising 119 Ch. 6: Co-conslrucling the menopallSe clinic profile. For example, eiba Geigy did it via specialists and general practitioners, pushing the doctors to actually use the patch. Now Ciba Geigy have changed their tack and they're marketing 10 women and putting ads in papers etc. Women themselves are becoming more aware, medical practitioners are also becoming more aware and they're speaking Qut, obviously for financial reasons and also for profile reasons to provide society with information on menopause. Menopause is a very large market QuI there~ there's a lot of women wanting to find out~ there's a lot of women who have had problems and 90% of them have probably sat at home and had nothing done, (Rod, private menopause clinic commercial manager) In parallel with the increasing numbers of private menopause clinics currently operating in Australia, menopause services are being remodelled along commercial lines. Private menopause clinics characteristically employ commercial managers whose role is to promote, liaise and optimise the viability of the clinic. The discourse of these clinic managers centre around '\"'maintaining a competitive an image\". For one private clinic, convenience is offered to busy 90s menopausal women with a same day service, while maintaining high quality management. Our competitive edge is that women can receive a high quality service that provides them with extended consultation times that enables them to clearly identify with the medical practitioner what their problems are, or what their potential problems might be and to receive a solution on the same day. Whether the solution is actually put into train on that day or the woman comes back having thought about the recommendation or suggestion is neither here nor there but it is available on the same day. So they can actually see a general practitioner and a specialist is available in the afternoon with all the results. They are making a complete assessment on the same day. No other centre provides that ability. (Rod, private menopause clinic commercial manager) Through this commercialist discourse and move towards privatisation , menopausal management has become more than just the provision of appropriate services. Menopausal management for many private (and public) clinics has been remade into the selling of a product, attracting the market, and maintaining that market by offering not only high quality services, but convenience and efficiency . The paucity of available services for the management of menopause during the 1970s was largely attributed to a lack of infonnation and education about menopause on the 12U Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic part of both women and general practitioners. There was a demand for information from women and medical practitioners alike. During the 19705 there was a great deal of concern and uncertainty about the use ofHRT and its associated long term risks. As feminists made clear, there was a lack ofinfonnation about menopause generally, as well as its management options. In response to this, menopause clinics became not just providers of menopausal care, but also providers of infonnation about menopause . From providers of primary menopausal care, menopause clinics were reworked into sites of specialist expertise. As authorities on the management of menopause, clime practitioners targeted not anJy menopausal women but also local general practitioners. This strategy served a dual purpose -not only did it provide education, but it also served to enrol groups of menopausal women directly. as well as enrolling local general practitioners who could refer women into the clinic network. This education and training provision by menopause clinic practitioners influenced the growing status of menopause clinics as sites of specialist expertise. Menopause clinics were not an inevitable nor an obvious outcome, but were constructed as an offshoot of endocrine clinics. The necessary articulation of women demanding menopausal services, the availability of interested and informed medical practitioners , responding institutional structures, together with the social climate promoting increased women's health care provision all contributed to the establishment of the first menopause clinics. Menopause was clearly perceived as an endocrine problem during this period. Since then, this problematisation of menopause has been translated into many different kinds of problems. Different groups with disparate needs and interests have come together in the construction and stabilisation of the menopause clinic. The ways these collectives have worked these differences has resulted in shifts in the way that menopaus e has become problematised. Menopause is not just a problem of hot flushes and dry vaginas. The continued reconstruct ion of the menopause clinic network has reshaped and translated menopau se into problems of prevention, education provision and specialist care. Relationall y, menopause clinics are no longer just sites of primary menopausal care. Menopause clinics have become specialist locales where prevention and risk management are promoted, and commercial 121 Ch. 6: Co-construcling the menopause clinic enterprises which service the menopause market, as well as sites of expertise providing education and training to both the general and medical community . Interest-ing general practitioners as allies in network building The successful establishment of menopau se clinics has required the enrolment of alliances in the fannatian of the network as well as a resilience of the network to competing forces -a process of 'interessement'. The interactions of local general practitioners with menopause clinics illustrate both how alliances are forged and competing forces resisted in the process of network building. Acting as an imerface in these interactions is the work of the boundary object of menopau se as hormone deficiency. Not only does this notion of menopause work to bring together groups of local general practitioners and menopause clinic participants, but it also works to extend and stabilise the problematisation of menopause as hormone deficiency. In Australia, the first pOI1 of call for women experiencing pro blems with menopause is their local general practitioner. As was exemplified in Nina's story, most women pal1icipating in this study expressed dissatisfaction with their general practitioners in relation to seeking help for menopausal problems. Most women commented that their general practitioners were not interested in their problems , did not take them seriously or lacked the expertise to manage their problems . General practitioners , I firmly believe, just don't know enough, even now, they still don't know enough to treat women who have got hormone replacement problems . (Mirna) I think I started menopause when I was 42, 8 years ago. My periods became very irregular and I went to my general practitioner, the ones I had taken my kids to for years and he suggested that I was pregnant and I said 1 wasn't. He insisted I have a pregnancy test and of course I wasn't pregnant and his attitude was, \"oh these things happen\". I went back to him when I was 45 with the same sort of symptoms, these things have stuck in my mind, he was a male doctor, and he said, \"oh you're going through menopause\" . At 42 he said J was pregnant and these things happen, at 45 it was menopause and yet it was the same sort of things happening . (Rita) 122 Ch. 6: Co-construcling the menopause clinic Most women attending menopause clinics had previously been seen and initially treated by their local general practitioner. Despite the women's lack of satisfaction with their general practitioners in tenns of menopausal management, the specialist menopause clinic practitioners insisted that primary menopausal care should be managed within the domain of general practice. The specialist practitioners52 in the menopause clinic were consistent in their view that their role is to act as a specialist referral centre to manage difficult and complex cases which cannot be appropriately managed by local general practitioners. Once a woman has been appropriately managed and her problems stabilised, most specialist practitioners in public hospital based menopause clinics choose to refer the women back to their local general practitioner for continuing care. This setting up of the general practitioner as primary care giver, and menopause clinic practitioner as specialist practitioner , results from a series of negotiations and transactions . A system exists in most menopause clinics where women are required to have a referral from their local general practitioner before they can attend the clinic.,B Women attending menopause clinics told differing stories about obtaining referrals from their general practitioners. Some general practitioners were happy to refer women because either they felt that the women did need specialist help or because the women perceived the general practitioners not to be interested in dealing with the problem. He (general practitioner) just didn't know anything about it. He was not interested at all. He doesn't know. He was so pleased when he heard I was going to see someone else. I think he was pleased that he didn't have to deal with me any more. I think there are a lot of doctors and general practitioners around who just don 't care ~ they really don't care. (Moira) .~~ I usc the term 'specialist practitioners ' here to indicate the combined groups of specialist gynaecolog ists. endocrinologists. physicians. psychologists and medical practitioners with an interest in women's heahh who work within the menopause clinic. I do this 10 distinguish them from the local community general practitioner whose main role is primary health care . . ~.l In Australia . this system of referral is a necessary procedure to enable the payment of Medicare benefits. To obLain the services of a specialist or a consultant physician. a referral must first be obtained fTom either a general practitioner or another specialist medical practitioner . (Commonwealth Department of Hwnan Services and Heahh. 1995. p.5). 123 Ch. 6: CO-conslrucling the menopause clinic However, some women told of the displeasure of their general practitioners when asked to write a referra1 to a menopause clinic, as they felt that their competence and expertise were under question. These women usuaUy sought a more compliant general practitioner. Alliances therefore needed to be established between local general practitioners and menopause clinics to enable this referral process. This system is surpassed in certain clinics where general practitioners with an interest in women's health are employed who can then provide the necessary referral for the women to see a specialist practitioner within the same clinic. General practitioners and menopause clinic practitioners are both integral within the menopause arena. Both kinds of practitioners provide menopausal management but do so in different ways, in different sites and often to different groups of women. A gradient of ab/normality of menopause is established in tenns of the type of management deemed to be required. 'Normal' or straightforward menopause becomes the baseline with increasing degrees of abnormality or complexity as the gradient inclines.s4 Currently, general practitioners manage 'straightforward ' menopausal problems and menopause clinics manage more complex cases. These two groups have particular kinds of interests and foci. General practitioners manage, advise and treat a wide variety of health problems . In general practice, presenting health complaints are seen in relation to lifestyle habits, personal responsibilities and previous health concerns . Women's menopausal complaints are thus positioned in the context of other considerations and concerns. Specialist menopause clinic practitioner s however, have a much more narrow focus of specialist interest, articulated in tenns of therapeutic management , research and teaching. Despite these differences , what each is managing is still a notion of menopause in terms of deficient hormones . It is the malleability of the boundary object of menopause as hormone deficiency which enables these two groups to come together and interact, and maintain a commonality despite tangential interests. This concept of menopause is not fixed, but is worked and moulded in different kinds of ways, in different circumstances by different groups . . ~4 A similar gradient of normal/abnom131 in !.erms of pregnancy and childbirth is extensively discussed. in Arney (1982). 124 Ch. 6: Co-construcling the menopause clinic How then do these two disparate collectives work this notion of menopause, and how does this work enable alliances to be forged within the clinic network? I have aJready noted the shift from when the first menopause clinics were established in the 19705 and menopause clinic practitioners were the main proyiders of primary menopausal management, to the current situation in which general practitioners have taken over the role of primary menopausal care providers. S5 In the intervening period, menopause clime practitioners have constructed themselves as authorities within the menopause arena. The links between menopausal research and menopausal practice have contributed to this construction of clinic practitioners as respected knowers in the field. Positioned within established hospital networks, menopause clinics have been able to conduct research into various aspects of menopausal management. The hospital network not only enabled this research process but also provided the necessary status towards the clinics' authority and legitimacy . In providing education and training to local general practitioners, menopause climc practitioners have constructed themselves as \"knowers\" within the menopause arena. A number of menopause clinic practitioners continue to conduct specialist education programmes on menopause, specifically targeted towards general practitioners. These programmes, which are generally well attended by general practitioners, comprise both informal seminars and more fonnal courses leading to further qualifications in menopau sal management and women's health. A menopause clinic practitioner commented on the increased accessibility and success of these programmes . I think community education is more important. The Jean Hailes Foundation.'i 6 provides an avenue for general practitioners to learn; there's a certificate course in menopause medicine that started up last year. The general practitioner who wants to know can find it. We had this forum; there were 300 general practitioners at the forum at the Radisson . Almost every scientific meeting of the College ofObstelrics & Gynaecology has something on menopause and the ~.\\ This is a similar shift to the one I alluded to in Chapter 4 with respect to general practitioners, Family Planning Clinics and contraception management. Family Planning Clinics were the primary providers of the oral contraceptive pill when it was first introduced. As general practitioners became more familiar and became more convinced of the benefits of lhis means of contraception. the contracep tive pill became readily available wilhin general practice. $(, The Jean Hailes Foundation is the education ann of a private menopause clinic which aims to provide community education about aspects of women's health, as weI! as medical educalion to practitioners about menopause and its management (Jean Hailes Foundation Newsletler, Sept. 1994). 125 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause c1i~c Australian Menopause Society has meetings. There are opportunities for general practitioners to attend meetings . (Mary, director of public menopause clinic) Such programmes consolidate the alliances fenned between general practitioners and menopause clinic practitioners, and furthermore, reinforce their identification and respective positions within the network as providers of primary menopausal care and specialist menopausal management. The ways that HRT has been remodelled and promoted since the 1970s have also contributed to the construction of the ab/nonnal menopause gradient and the respective positions of medical menopause practitioners. Since the 1970s, there has been a shift in the routine prescribing ofHRT by genera1 practitioners. I have already discussed the reluctance of general practitioners in the 1970s to prescribe HR.T due to concerns about its long term effects and a lack of familiarity and information about this technology. Since then, both pharmaceutical companies and the specialist menopause community have worked hard at reassuring general practitioners that the risks associated with HRT can be appropriately managed and that HRT does offer many benefits to the menopausal and post menopausal woman. Educational seminars, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies, and specifically targeting general practitioners are geared towards educating and reassuring general practitioners , while at the same time promoting the technology. There is an increasing number of articles on menopause in the Australian medical literature which specifically targets general practitioners (Murkies , 1992; Traynor, Britl, & Sayer, 1995; Wren, 1993). These articles, often written by well known menopause clinic practitioners , aim to address and answer the common problems encountered with HRT in general practice. In discussing commonly encountered problems through case studies and suggesting appropriate management strategies , such articles aim to simplify the exhaustive infonnation available on HR T and its different regimens (Murkies , 1992). In addition, pharmaceutical companies have developed fonnulations ofHRT which simplifY management for general practitioners . as well as women consumers . Newly developed fonns of HR.T do not only purport to be more efficacious and better tolerated, but also offer easier prescribing . For example, the pharmaceutica1 company , Rhone Poulenc Rorer recently released a new series of hormonal patches on the market. These patches 126 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic are available in 37.5, 50 and 75~g doses and, as the accompanying promotional material states, these patches \"makes it easier to give a dose that is neither too high nor too low\" and offer a \u00abrefined dose range to meet individual needs\" (The patch to match, 1995). The development of new dosages and combinations ofhonnonal formulations to enable easier prescribing is a growing trend adopted by many pharmaceutical companies. When oestrogen was first released, choice of administration was restricted to the oral form with limited dosage combinations . Non-oral delivery systems have since been introduced in various dosages and oestrogen-progesterone combinations , making it easier for the prescribing practitioner to balance the honnonal dosage required for the individual woman. Packaging of many ofthe oral forms of HRT closely resembles the packaging of the oral contraceptive pill, making the product familiar to both women users and prescribing practitioners of the contraceptive piu. The employment of these various strategies work to enable the local general practitioner to become a routine prescriber ofHRT and thus a provider of primary menopausal care. Alliances forged between general practitioners and menopause clinic practitioners are reinforced through continuing education provision to general practitioners by specialist clinic practitioners . Together with the phannaceutical industry's strategies , resistance from general practitioners in tenns of reluctance to prescribe HRT is suppressed by reassuring general practitioners that their concerns can be managed , and that the benefits ofHRT far outweigh its risks. Over the last two decades there has been an increased emphasis on preventive heaJth care. Strategies are advocated which will reduce the ever increasing economic and social burden on the health care system. General practice is seen as an appropriate avenue within which to promote preventive health care and risk management. This general phenomenon has had specific implication s for menopause . Together with the shift in the role of general practitioners towards primary menopausal care and prevention , there has been the reconstruction ofHRT into a preventive agent for osteoporosi s and heart disease. These moves have contributed to the positioning of general practitioners as responsible for managing \"normal\" menopause as well as preventing its implicated associated diseases. These alliances have forged the primary role of menopause clinics as specialist centres, responsible for the management of Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic 127 complex, abnonnal cases of menopause. Menopause has been constructed into different things for these two groups of practitioners, yet tros understanding of menopause is still sufficiently flexible that it can act as a common interface. Despite these two groups working different kinds of menopause, the common language of hormone deficiency serves as a bridge which forges the relations constructed within this section of the menopause arena. In addition to the alliances forged between general practitioners and the menopause clinic are those fanned within the clinic itself between the various medical specialist groups. In discussing the competing conceptualisations of menopause in Chapter 5, I traced the emerging relations between gynaecology, endocrinology and psychology. Within the menopause clinic, these interrelations have been transformed and yet continue to be enacted. Women's gynaecological problems are managed by gynaecologists, hormonal fine tuning performed by endocrinologists, and psychological problems are handled by psychologists. As Nina found during her attendance at the menopause clinic, her bleeding was investigated and managed by the clinic gynaecologist, the dosage of her HRT was regulated by an endocrinologist and her emotional problems were dealt with by the psychologist. Akin to the interdisciplinarity of the !\"Y'1aecology and psychiatry clinic of the late 1940s (Snaith & Ridley, 1948) discussed in Chapter 5, the contemporary menopause clinic has constructed and maintained a network of interrelation s between these and other professional groups. In the following sections I show how the bringing together of these different groups and their heterogeneous assemblages has worked to fonn alliances and to strengthen the web of interactions of the clinic. It is this strengthening and stabilisation of relations that gives the network its resilience and its ability to oppose competing forces. Enrolling new technosocial collectives in the network The process of' interessement' is essential in the establishment of a network. Within the menopause clinic, it was, and continues to be, necessary to build a network of relations between general practitioners and menopause clinic practitioners to enable women to initially attend the clinic. As this occurs, the enrolment of new technosocial 128 Ch. 6: Co--conslructing lhe menopause clinic collectives is required to stabilise the developing network. Enrolment of these groups results in the forging of new alliances, thus expanding and strengthening the existing web of interrelations. To illustrate the process of enrolment in the menopause clinic, I focus on three technosocial collectives, namely, bone densitometry , cardiology and breast cancer screening. These three collectives are characterised by their heterogenous membership , comprising not just the human operators and service providers but also the tools and technologies which, as I elaborate further in the next chapter, play such a vital role in the stabilisation of the clinic network. Buildi1lg b01les Osteoporosis is a decrease of bone mass throughout the skeleton (American College of Physicians , 1984). With this condition, bone fonnation does not keep pace with bone resorption , leading to the thinning of bone structures and loss of bone strength (Melton, 1990). Prior to the early 1940s, osteoporosis was considered to be a condition of old age. ~7 It was thought that the stimulus required for the fonnation of the organic bone matrix was mechanical stress and a lack of these mechanical stresses led to \"atrophy of disuse\" (Albright , Bloomberg , & Smith, 1940, p. 298). As Albright et aJ. (1940, p. 299) go on to elaborate, \"just as very elderly people have atrophy of their hair, skin and tissues in general so do they have atrophy of their bones\". Osteoporosis was seen during this period as an atrophic condition associated with old age which could be observed in both men and women. Since then, osteoporosis has been reworked from a condition of old age to a disease associated with women, specifically menopausal women. This phenomenon has seen osteoporosis made into a gendered disease through its reconstruction into a complication of menopause . Although the association between osteoporosis and loss of oestrogen had been known since the 1930s, it was the work of AJbright which contributed to the increased association between osteoporosis and menopause . In a keynote address to the 5\" This understanding of osteoporosis refers specifically to primary osteoporosis. and not the secondary classification of osteoporosis . associated wiLh conditions such as hyperparath yroidism (increased activity of the parathyroid glands). steroid therapy. acromegaly (hyper secretion of pituitary growth honnone) and prolonged calcium deficiency. (Bentley, 1967. p. 155) 129 Ch. 6: Co-conslructing the menopause clinic Association of American Physicians in 1940, Fuller Albright differentiated between senile osteoporosis and the condition of \"post menopausal osteoporosis',ss (Albright, Bloomberg , & Smith, 1940, p.299). During this address, Albright gave preliminary findings about the possiblt:: use of oestrogen, or estrin, to restore calcium and phosphorus balance in post menopausal women. However , Albright was cautious in his advice to the Association 's physicians, \u00abWhether the effect of estrin on the calcium balance in post-menopausal osteoporosis is sufficient to make its administration of practical clinical value, it is as yet too soon to say\" (Albright , Bloomberg , & Smith, 1940, p.30S). In the early I 980s, researchers of oestrogen and honnones once again followed Albright's lead. Studies published during this period reiterated the association between oestrogen and prevention of osteoporosis (Shoemaker, Forney & MacDonald, 1977 ~ Weinstein, 1980). Of significance here is not only that osteoporosis was being reworked from a disease of old age to a gendered disease of a small number of high risk women during menopause, but that it was being made into a concern for all menopausal women. Paramount in this reshaping of osteoporosis was the development of visualisation and screening technologies for osteoporosis . Radiologists in the 1960s concentrated on the development of various radiographic methods to detect osteoporosis (Bentley, 1967; Cameron & Sorensen , 1963; Selle & Jurist, 1966). This early work on radiographic methods served to secure the place of osteoporosis as a disease and not just a condition of old age. The focus ofthe early developers of these techniques centred on investigation of aetiology and therapeutic evaluation of osteoporosis using bone densitometry (Selie & Jurist, 1966). It is not until later that the development and assessment of bone densitometry techniques shifted to the early detection and diagnosis of osteoporosis , for the specific purpose of preventing the condition . During the 1980s, different radiographic techniques were undergoing development. Although the aim of these techniques was to measure bone mineral density and thus ~~ Albright presented work from a study of 40 post menopausal women under the age of 65 years, who had either undergone surgical menopause or natural menopause (Albright. Bloomberg, & Smith. 1940). 130 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic assess the rate of bone loss as a measure of osteoporosis, what is evident is a move towards the use of these techniques for the purpose of screening and monitoring of osteoporosis . The shift in the use ofthis technology from detection to prevention of osteoporosis is clearly illustrated by the position paper on bone densitometry issued by the American College of Physicians in 1987 (American College of Physicians, 1987). This paper begins with the increasing incidence of fractures in the US and the ascending health care costs attributed to osteoporosis. In promoting bone densitometry as a valuable tool, the paper goes on to outline its uses: The primary potential clinica1 uses of densitometry are screening asymptomatic persons to assess the risk for future fractures, measuring bone density of persons with conditions associated with osteopenia, and monitoring changes to assess response to treatment.(American College of Physicians, 1987, p.932, my italics) Although the 1987 position paper concludes that bone densitometry \"should not yet be used routinely for general screening of the female population to assess the risk for future fractures\" (American College of Physicians, 1987, p.935), this potential move is clearly flagged. The development of radiographic techniques for the detection and screening of osteoporosis was not however a straightforward progression. Studies from the 1960s outlined the many technical problems faced by the developers of these methods (Bentley, 1967 ~ Cameron & Sorensen, 1963). A recent review of the various bone densitometry technologicaJ approaches suggests continuing problems with the performance and precision of the technology (Sartoris, Moscona., & Resnick, 1990). A major problem encountered is the resilience of the bones themselves. Bone loss varies at different skeletal sites and while some bones of an individual may be considered osteoporotic , others are not. Measurement of bone mass at one skeletal site cannot be used to predict bone mass at another site of the same individual . In addition, is the problem of considering bone loss as a disease state, as loss of bone mass occurs in everyone at some stage. Further complications are safety concerns with the use of radiation techniques , the cost of the bone scans and the time taken for the test to be carried out (some taking an unacceptably long 20-60 mins) (Melton, Eddy, & Johnston , 1990). Bone densitometry is a technology under construction ; it continues to 13l Ch. 6: Co-construcling the menopause clinic be worked and reworked. It is this lack of closure which has enabled its enrolment into the menopause clinic arena and has shaped the building of alliances between the bone densitometry collective and that of the menopause clinic. The enrolment of bone densitometry into the menopause climc arena aptly illustrates the working of menopause as hormone deficiency as a boundary object. The shift in bone densitometry from detection to prevention of osteoporosis is consistent with the increased emphasis on HR T as a preventive agent against osteoporosis. For bone densitometrists, the menopause clinic presents not only as a place where bone loss in symptomatic women can be detected but it provides an ongoing site for screening of asymptomatic women. Within the menopause clinic, bone densitometry is now used as a powerful enticement to potential women clients. Furthermore, the authority of the menopause clinic as a specialist centre with particular expertise is extended in its recommendations to women regarding the most appropriate type of hone densitometry techniques . Women are urged to seek the latest and most efficient bone densitometry methods provided by the clinic, and resist the promotion of less accurate (and cheaper) alternatives . It is important you are tested correctly by a DEXA machine which measures bone density (loss of calcium) in the spine and hip. U1trasound of the heel is an experimental technology and not recognised by Medicare as the correct test for osteoporosis . This is where you discover the first signs of osteoporosis, not areas like the heel. It's often impossible to provide an accurate diagnosis when testing the heel. Women who have had an ultrasound testing of the heel are strongly advised to re-test correctly as soon as possible. Testing with the DEXA machine is simple, safe, fast, accurate and completely painless. (Victorian Centre for Women's Health, 1995) In addition to the potential economic market for the use of this technology , the menopause clinic also offers an avenue (and available subjects) for further research and development in the use of radiographic techniques . For a technology undergoing continual reworking and further development , provision of a potential research site and available subjects is attractive . Bone densitometry, HRT and menopausal women have become important elements in the increasing number of cost effectiveness analyses conducted for the prevention of osteoporosis . Weinstein (1980) performed the first of 132 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic the analyses of this kind. Further studies, reviewed by Johanesson & Jonsson (1993), have expanded on Weinstein 's model to evaluate, in economic tenns, the costs, risks and benefits of osteoporosis prevention. Such studies are used to provide infonnation on the feasibility of mass screening of osteoporosis in asymptomatic women (M\"elton, Eddy, & Johnston, 1990). Together with clinical trials into the efficacy ofHRT as a prophylactic, these cost effectiveness analyses work to reinforce and strengthen the relations between bone densit.ometry , HRT, menopausal women and practitioners -all participants of the menopause clinic network. Different collectives of the menopause clinic each come with a different focus on menopause, bones and osteoporosis . Despite these different local interpretation s and investments, these groups are able to interact, fonn alliances and make robust a network of relations. For menopause clinic physicians , the alliance of bone densitometry provides what is assumed to be a ready means of diagnosing and monitoring bone toss in menopausal women. Prior to the implementation of these radiological technique s, osteoporosis was diagnosed retrospectively following fractures. Bone densitometry provides a means by which bone loss can be measured earty. Early bone loss is made to show itself in the clinic where it is construed as a symptom of hormone deficiency , remaking HRT as a prophylactic treatment for osteoporosis . After commencement of preventive therapy. bone loss can then be monitored and the appropriate therapy rehrulated . For menopause clinic physicians then, the concept of menopause as hormone deficiency takes on a different focus to that of the bone densitometrists ; the clinic practitioners' concerns centre on diagnosis, prevention and monitoring . Feminists have drawn attention to the playing on women's fear by the osteoporosis prevention campaigns . These feminists claim that such promotional campaigns play on women's dread of osteoporosis and associated susceptibility to fractures, as well as their dismay about ageing (Worcester & Whatley, 1992). An advertising brochure from the Osteoporosis Foundation of Australia59 illustrates this point: ~'I Thc Ostcoporosis Foundalion or Auslralia claims to be an infonnation and support group which assists medical research into osteoporosis . This organisation is sponsored by Abbott Australasia. a 133 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic Hip fractures are probably the most serious and dangerous of osteoporosis fractures. The number of women who die from complications ofa hip fracture exceeds that of the number who die of cancer of the breast, uterus and cervix. Of those who are discharged from hospital, 70% are seriously debilitated and many are dependent on a walker or wheelchair for life. It is important that the community becomes aware oftbis crippling) silent disease. (Osteoporosis Foundation of Australia . no date) This message is combined with an illustration on the cover of the brochure of three women showing progressive ageing, dowdiness. frailty and developing dowager's hump; the discourse is clearly one affear and dread. To prevent this \"crippling, silent disease\"> women are urged to take HR T> and remain on the therapy long tenn. As Donna noted, fear is instilled in women by both the phannaceutica1 industry and the medical profession. Donna had been prescribed HR.T by her local general practitioner for hot flushes, night sweats and constant tiredness. After being on HR.T for 5 years, Donna considered going off the therapy. She was not in a high risk category for osteoporosis . Donna recalled to me the response she received from her local genera1 practitioner: I had been to a general practitioner and asked whether I should stop taking HR.T and he showed me this advertisement which was in his surgery of a woman with a dowager's hump. He said to me, \u00abdo you want to look like that?\". I thought \"oh no\" and I continued taking it. (Donna, 45 years) Women like Donna and Nina, although suffering from acute menopausal problems were not necessarily in a high risk category for osteoporo sis. Donna's bone densitometry showed that her bones were healthy. However , she was still urged to remain on I-ffi. T for its potential benefits. Osteoporosi s prevention urges women to take responsibility for their own health. Publication of national hea1th costs related to osteoporosis and the reduction to these costs by the implementation of prevention strategies , such as those published by Johanesson & Jonsson (1993), indirectly urge women to reduce the health care budget leading supplier of HRT in Australia . These links clearly exemplify the interdependencies of the network. 134 Ch. 6: Co-construcLing the menopause clinic by taking preventive measures. Women interviewed in this study also discussed taking HR.T as a preventive measure against osteoporosis to avoid \u00abbecoming a burden on their families\", My fear is that I'm on my own. I have a marvellous family -three brothers and a sister, and nieces and nephews who are most supportive . I know if there was a problem they would rally. But I'm also very independent and I would hate to be a burden to anyone. The thought of ending up a cripple or something, in a wheelchair or in a home. I'd rather be in the big garden in the sky or wherever. I would hate that, and therefore I hope that with my osteoporosis, that the HRT will help the bone density. (Gay, 68 years with diagnosed osteoporosis) No differentiation is made between asymptomat ic menopausal women, women at low risk of osteoporosis and those at high risk of osteoporosis . For all menopausal women, osteoporosis is constructed as part of the equation, and algorithmically , HRT is inserted as the solution. Osteoporosis is made into the system of orderings for menopausal women. Women are urged to consider osteoporosis in their decision making on whether to commence on HRT, or whether to remain on HRT after their acute complaints are under control. Women's understanding of menopause and osteoporosis thus differs from that of bone densitometrists and clinic practitioners . For women, osteoporosis presents with the possibility of fractures, of requiring long term care, and fear of a potentially disabling or life threatening condition. For women at risk of osteoporosis . the menopause clinic provides a means to detect and monitor this condition and an opportunit y to take preventive measures and ensure a sense of responsibility for your own health. In the orderings of the menopause clinic network, pharmaceutical companies play an influential and vital role. Pharmaceuti cal companies have an obvious corrunercia l interest in the promotion ofHRT for prevention of osteoporosis . Medical recommendations advocate that for maximum benefit in reducing the risks of osteoporosi s, HRT should be taken for 10-20 years or more (Grady, Cummings , Petitti, Rubin, & Audet, 1992, p.l 038). Pharmaceutical companies financed massive promotional campaigns in the 1980s and 90s to increase awareness about osteoporosis and the role ofHRT in its prevention. The advertisements for HRT from this period highlight the emerging links between HRT and osteoporosis , with wheelchairs 135 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic becoming the new symbol for osteoporosis . Directly targeting potential medical prescribers ofHRT, one advenisement read: \"Which would you rather prescribe to a potential osteoporosis sufferer? ..... Take a course ofPrempak (positioned beneath a photo of a packet ofHR T tablets) or let nature take its course? (beneath a photo of a wheelchair) (Ayerst Wyeth, no date). Many pharmaceutical companies, such as Ayerst Wyeth, hired public relations companies to enlist leading expens in the field to increase community awareness of osteoporosis , particularly targeting women consumers (Coney, 1991, p.170). In contributing to the massive promotion ofHRT and osteoporosis prevention, phannaceutica1 companies remain a major influence in the menopause clinic arena. In addition to advertising and promotion, many phannaceutical companies fund research conducted in menopause clinics and offer subsidies to the clinic practitioners for attendance at conferences and seminars. In terms of prevention, osteoporosis has yet another focus. During the 1980s, public awareness of osteoporosis increased markedly . The media featured numerous articles on osteoporosis and its prevention , the phannaceutical industry launched massive campaigns on the use ofHRT to prevent osteoporosis. and osteoporosis screening centres became more widespread (Napoli, 1988). In their promotion of dairy foods to prevent osteoporo sis, the dairy industry particularly targeted, and continue to target. women in the community. Although osteoporosis occurs in both men and women, the problem is exacerbated in women due to the decline in oestrogen levels associated with increased bone loss (Lindsay & Cosman, 1990). The dairy industry uses this in targeting both young and older women to increase their daily calcium intake through dairy foods. In 1989, the British dairy industry spent 10 million pounds on targeting various groups of women -pregnant and lactating women, dieters and older women (Coney, 1991, p.1 06). The dairy industry, having been faced with falling sales due to the community 's concerns with saturated fats in dairy products, stepped up their promotional campaigns to promote dairy products as a healthy preventive against osteoporosis . The message of the dairy industry was given additional boost by public health campaigns about measures to prevent osteoporosis. In 1985, the US National Institute of Health announced a recommendation that women increase their daily ca1cium allowance to prevent osteoporosis (Coney, ] 991, p. 106). The alliance 136 Ch. 6: CO-construcling the menopause clinic between the dairy industry and menopause clinics is clear in the integrated clinic advertising and promotion advocating maintenance of dietary calcium with dairy foods. Recipes promoting the use of dairy foods, charts outlining food sources containing calcium, tables displaying daily calcium requirem~nts are prominently displayed and made available to women attending menopause clinics. In this way, milk, yoghurt, cheese and other dairy products are constituted into important entities in the menopause network . Osteoporosis is a multiple, flexible entity. Its meanings are produced in relation to other elements, or in semiotic terms, it is co-constituted in relation to other signs. For women, osteoporosis is to be feared, for clinicians it must be diagnosed and managed, for bone densitometry machines it is subject to measurement and calculation. Osteoporosis is read relationally to milk and dairy foods in terms of building bones, while with HRT it becomes something to be prevented. In the building of the menopause clinic, particular relations are co-constituted between these entities. These entities are incorporated in the network by their ability to work menopause~ in this case, in tenns of osteoporosis . However, there are certain elements left out of the ordering of the menopause clinic. Particular readings and entities are differentiated as <noise,60 and are omitted from the network. Despite the association of osteoporosis with fractures , usually caused by falls, infonnation relating to reducing the incidence of falls in later life is read as extraneous and does not get incorporated into the network. Exercise programs that focus on improving balance and strength which could be helpful in reducing the risk of falls in the elderly have been proposed elsewhere (Melton, 1990). However , these efforts have not been actively pursued in relation to the efforts devoted to the use ofHRT as a preventive measure. Clogging arteries Akin to the interdependencies with osteoporosis in the clinic network are the interrelations with heart disease. Heart disease results from the blockage and hardening I>l! Mol and Mcsman (11)96) provide an interesting discussion on the exclusion or \"noise\", which they differentiate from order. 137 Ch. 6: Co-conslructing the menopause clinic of the arteries ~ it is a disease of the cardiovascular system. However, as with osteoporosis , heart disease has been constructed into a complication of menopause . Saturated fats and cholesterol in the diet are thought to increase the risk of heart disease. Cholesterol from the gut becomes attached to lipoproteins in the bloodstream which work to transport the cholesterol around the body. There are two types of lipoproteins -high density lipoproteins (HDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) which work antagonistically in the body. High levels of LDL are thought to increase the risk of heart disease while high levels ofHDL are thought to lessen the risks. Oestrogen is believed to increase levels ofHDL and reduce (Cabot, 1991; Coney, 1991; Farrell Westmore , 1993). It is this function of oestrogen which is taken up and reworked in the promotion of oestrogen for preventing heart disease. With the association of oestrogen as preventive agent of cardiovascular disease, heart disease is shaped into a complication of menopause . The medical literature abounds with reports that coronary heart disease is the leading cause of death in post menopausal women (Grady, Rubin, et aI., 1992, p.l020). Prior to menopause , women have only one fifth the risk of heart disease compared to men of the same age. However, with the decline of oestrogen during menopause , the prevention of heart disease conferred by oestrogen diminishes (Farrell & Westmore, 1993, p.86). Replacement of this declining oestrogen is therefore thought to counteract the risks of heart disease. Detection and treatment of heart disease remain the primary concerns of the cardiology profession . However, reworking the boundaries of menopause enables the enrolment of cardiology into the menopause clinic arena. This process of enrolment has established preliminary links and interactions between the menopause clinic and cardiology . However , in contrast to osteoporosis , these interactions appear far more tenuous. The links made between heart disease and the preventive effects of oestrogen face considerable challenges, contributing to the vulnerability of the relations established . Medical researchers generally concur that oestrogen therapy alone is thought to reduce the risk of heart disease by about 35%. However, the findings become muddied when oestrogen combined with progesterone are examined . Progesterones appear to counteract the benefits of oestrogen in reducing 138 Ch. 6: Co-conslructing the menopause clinic the risk of heart disease but the research to date with combined oestrogen and progesterone is inconclusive (Grady, Rubin, et aI., 1992). These unconvincing findings weaken the links formed within the menopause network, adding doubt to the value of oestrogen as a preventive agent against heart disease. This ambivalence in the association between HRT and prevention of coronary heart disease is also influenced by the portrayal of coronary heart disease as a men's disease (Broom, 1995). The 1992 Annual Report of the Baker Medical Research Institute, a leading Australian heart disease research centre, comments on the sexed image of coronary heart disease (Baker Medical Research Institute, 1992). The emphasis on the association between men and coronary heart disease has resulted in a diminished focus on women and coronary heart disease, particularly regarding the exclusion of women as participants in research on coronary heart disease. The tenuousness of the links between menopause and heart disease is further supported by the women in this study. For most women, osteoporosis was the predominant factor considered in their evaluation of whether to take HRT. Heart disease was rarely mentioned by the women and did not appear to be a serious consideration in their decision making in regard to HRT. Even for women like Cate, with a family history of heart disease, and Nancy, who had high blood pressure, the prospect oftaking HRT for prevention of this condition remained unconvincing . I think that my general practitioner did not discuss with me the pros and cons of HRT. She said that my father had died of a heart attack and this is protecting me. Is that a good enough reason to take it? I don't think so. (Cate) Yes, when they told me you better take these hormones after my hysterectomy , I thought, \"is it that bad that I have to take it?\". They told me about the bone density, not a lot about heart disease, because I wasn't concerned about it, because 1 didn't have high blood pressure at that time. That's a bit worrying now I think. 1fT stop taking the hormones and I still have this high blood pressure, I don't know ... (Nancy) Most women interviewed did not mention heart disease. For those that did, having a healthy diet was considered more important in circumventing the possibility of heart disease than the use of HR T. 139 Ch. 6: Co-cons(ructing the menopause clinic The process of enrolling hean disease in the menopause clinic network exemplifies the flexibility ofthe HRT concept. This flexibility enables oestrogen deficiency to be reworked as a contributing factor of heart disease. Emphasis is thus placed on oestrogen replacement as a preventive agent. Ho~ever, unlike the robustness of the osteoporosis links, the connections between heart disease and menopause are thus far more tenuous and susceptible to challenge. Despite the findings which advocate the use ofHRT for heart disease prevention and the work ofHRT proponents to promote oestrogen, this position remains susceptible to opposition and continues to be a weak link within the network. Within menopause clinics, practitioners, although aware of the claims ofHRT in prevention of heart disease, retained a degree of ambivalence about its promotion for this purpose, Like the women interviewed, the clinic practitioners did not talk about heart disease, in relation to their obvious interest in osteoporosis. Despite both osteoporosis and heart disease being constructed as complications of menopause, it is clearly osteoporosis which is prominent in the orderings of the clinic. Screening breasts The enrolment of breast cancer screening within menopause clinics differs from that of osteoporosis and heart disease. With osteoporosis and heart disease, the use of hormone replacement is constructed as a preventive strategy. Menopause is made into an experience where women can opt to take responsibility for their health by taking preventive measures against possible long term diseases. Breast cancer screening is constructed primarily as a strategy for managing the increased risk of breast cancer associated with the use of HR T. Since the late 1970s, with the disintegration of Wilson's technosocial world of Feminine Forever and the release of studies showing an association between HR T and breast cancer, combating the risk of breast cancer has become an important consideration . Since the 1980s, strategies have been carried out to both investigate risk factors and stabilise these risks within acceptable levels. Considerable research has been carried out to investigate the risks of developing breast cancer with the use of HR T. Despite the large amount of data collected. the results have been inconsistent 140 Ch. 6: Co-constructing Jones, Ingram, Mattes, & Hahnel, (994). In a noted review of the current research, Grady, Rubin, et a1. (1992) conclude that there is no increased risk of breast cancer amongst short tenn users of oestrogen alone (less than 5 years). However, there may be an increased risk ofabaut 25% among long term users of oestrogen (greater than 10 years), with a questionable period between 5- 10 years. The findings with the combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy are even Jess conclusive due to the small amount of data available. These concerns with breast cancer and HR.T have led to the strong recommendations that women taking HRT should undergo regular breast cancer surveillance , using breast self examination, clinical breast examination andlor mammography (Grady, Cummings , et aI., 1992, p.1040). Many specialist physicians in menopause clinics routinely perfonn breast examinations on all women every 12-18 months (Marsh & Whitehead , 1992). This routine practice for all women of menopausal age, irrespective of whether they are on HRT. is supported by the findings of an increased incidence of breast cancer with increasing age. In addition, increased concern with medica/litigation has contributed to the adoption of such practices (Marsh & Whitehead , 1992, p.448). Nina's experience s typified those of the many women I interviewed . Most women had personal experiences with breast cancer, either having had breast cancer themselves, or like Nina, had mothers, or other female relatives or friends who had died of breast cancer. For these women, breast cancer was a real concern. Terri told afher anguish on discovering that she had abnormal breast lumps after her mammogram at the menopause clinic. I went to have my first mammogram and had the biggest shock of my life. I had the mammogram, walked out and forgot all about it, until I was called back. My legs turned to jelly -I thought they had found something. I saw a breast surgeon and was told it was benign, a laterally stretched patch in the left breast. Until last year I forgot to have another mammogram , I thought nothing was wrong with me. I do feel my breast in the shower with soap with my arm extended and J thought, 1 can't feel a thing. Again, it's a strange thing, every time I ask my husband (himself a medical practitioner) to feel it for me in case J miss something because I was told it can be very, very small, he doesn't seem to be very interested to do it correctly, the way I was taught. When he did, he couldn't find anything either so that helped strengthen my thought that there was nothing wrong with me. I had another mammogram done and they called 141 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic me back because of my right breast. I had to have surgery then -quite a big chunk afmy right breast taken out and thank goodness it's benign. It seems so serious -the incidence of breast cancer. I have lost a few mends. I've lost three very close friends and the last one was only 18 months ago. She only lasted 18 months since the day she found Ollt. It had a very bad impact on me. (Terri) In light of these events, Terri was fe-evaluating whether she should remain on HRT. Following discussions with her menopause clinic practitioner, Terri had stopped taking HR T, after having been on the therapy for 5 years. I started discussing with Dr. L (menopause clinic physician) that perhaps I should stop the HRT. He said the chances of getting more lumps would be more significant if! kept on the HRT. I don't think it's easy to have another setback, it's shocking to be told and have that surgery and to wait for the result. I had thought about the risks of breast cancer when I first started on HRT. In the literature you seem to hear that. It seems to be indicated that breast cancer is not reruly proven so I thought wen, the risk was worth taking. But until you experience it yourself when you're called up after a mammogram, it's quite a different thing, you're quite shocked .... My main wony is my breasts -the risk of having more lumps. If one day one of the lumps is malignant.. (Terri) For most women like Terri, the risks of contracting breast cancer are a serious considerat ion in their decision to whether commence or remain on HRT. The treatment of women's menopausal symptoms add to their chances of developing breast cancer. For those women who choose to take HRT, particularly long tenn HRT, the increased risks of breast cancer become an important concern. Thus, breast cancer screening becomes a strategy for managing this risk and uncertainty . Terri's experiences illustrate how women's experiences of menopause , together with their interactions with the technology of the clinic, rework not only the way they understand menopause but how this shapes their practices. T em was referred to the menopause clinic by her general practitioner for a combination of problems -emotional difficulties , concern with osteoporosis as well as minor symptoms. She was commenced on HR T for treatment of her hot flushes and prevention of possible osteoporosis . For Terri, the mammography findings of breast lumps, together with subsequent surgery and death of her friends with breast cancer, served to reshape menopause and HRT as significant risk factors for breast cancer. Terri's menopause, 142 Ch. 6: Co-conslrucling the menopause clinic previously characterised by a concern with osteoporosis and hot flushes, were reworked into a constant focus on the risk of developing breast cancer, thus requiring vigilant monitoring . One of the aims in setting up the first menopause clinic in 1967 and menopause clinics since, has been the opportunity to routinely screen large popUlations of women for diseases such as breast and cervical cancer. The enrolment of mammography in the menopause clinic not only provides screening for women at increased risk after taking BRI, but also provides routine screening of \"well women\". Simultaneous with the recent health promotion campaigns on osteoporosis, Australia has consolidated and politically emphasised campaigns to prevent breast cancer. The women interviewed in this study were, not surprisingly, very concerned about being at risk of developing breast cancer. Researchers, including those from the US National Institute of Health study, have found that more than 50% of people surveyed report breast cancer as women's greatest health concern (cited in Worcester & Whatley, 1992). Despite many critiques of the mammography screening programmes (Short, 1992; Worcester & Whatley, 1992), concern about breast cancer is still prevalent, with women taking HRT being doubly co ncerned. This anxiety is reflected by the increasing use of mammograms by women of menopausal age. A recent British study reported an increasing number of manunograms being perfonned outside the routine national screening programme . In this British programme , the increased number of mammograms was attributed to a 1.8 fold increase in the number ofreferrals from menopause clinics (Garstin, et aI., 1993). With breast cancer, menopause becomes an increased risk factor, both in terms of age and possible use ofHRT. The increased risk of breast cancer with HR.T deter many women, like Terri, from continuing to take HRT. Breast cancer is an obstacle to be overcome , or at least managed, in the stabilisation ofHRT. Mammography and breast screening is thus construed as a strategy for managing this risk. In the menopause clinic, with its high use ofHRT, mammography takes on particular significance . Mammography provides a means to manage the uncertainty of breast cancer, as well as providing routine breast screening ofuwell women\". The association ofHRT with Ch. 6: Co-construcling the menopause clinic breast cancer thus works to establish and secure links between the technosociaI collectives of breast screening and the menopause clinic. Summary 143 The aim of this chapter has been to examine how the various technosocial collectives of the menopause clinic come together to establish this elaborate and complex system of interactions. Menopause clinics are not an inevitable consequence of service provision for menopausal women, but are the product of extensive social and material engineering . The conceptual tools of actor network theory have served as useful guideposts with which to examine the building and establishment of the menopause clinic network. Using these tools, I have traced the ways in which the various technosociaJ collectives have corne together to build a system of relations. The strength and credibility of the process of establishing the menopause clinic has been through its ability to build a series of relations in which allies are enrolled and potential competing forces are negated. In addition, actor network theory's semiotic approach has proved useful in decoding the ways the entities of the menopause clinic co-construct each other. In so doing, the orderings of the clinic are exposed and the ways these orderings are generated become visible. In addition to these decoding tools, the notion of menopause as honnone deficiency as a boundary object is a useful instrument to examine how the various technosocial collectives have been enrolled into the menopause clinic arena. This understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency is a flexible concept allowing various translations . It is the malleability of this boundary object that allows different groups with local interests and investments to share in the practices of the clinic, despite each having different foci of interests within the menopause arena. The fluidity of the notion of menopau se as hormone deficiency allows the translation work of menopausal management trom primary care to specialist care between local general practitioners and specialist clinic practitioners . Similarly, it allows the co-construction of osteoporosis and heart disease into complications of menopause , requiring the use of HR.T as preventive agent. It is this flexibility that enables the reworking of bone 144 Ch. 6: Co-constructing the menopause clinic densitometry machines, dairy foods, women's bones, arteries and breasts into entities of the menopause clinic network. In this chapter, I have examined how the technosocial collectives of the menopause clinic have come together to establish the system of relations that make up the clinic network. I have traced how these interactions are strengthened through the enrolment of new collectives and the reshaping of entities within the menopause as hormone deficiency framework. The next chapter explores how this network of relations is stabilised and maintained against the resistances and abrasions which continually challenge the menopause clinic arena. Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic Chapter 7 -Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic Introduction 145 In examining the establishment of the menopau se clinic r have explored how the different technosocial collectives within the menopause clinic come together in shared work. I now focus on how the orderings constructed between the various technosocial collectives are maintained and attempts made at their stabilisation. More specifically, I want to ask two questions. First, how is the collective work of the menopause clinic stabilised, and second, what are the power relations generated through these processes of stabilisation? In addressing the process of stabilisation in the menopause clinic, ] am reminded by Fujimura (1992) to be aware of my focus for stabilisation. Taking Latour's The Pasteurisation <!f France (1988a) as an example of actor network theory approach, Fujimura suggests that Latour's focus in this text is on 'fact' stabilisation. Latour traces the network of negotiations and translations made by Pasteur in his attempt to convince the many groups around him about microbial theory and thus stabilise this theoretical concept as fact. My focus follows that of many recent interactionist science studies scholars61 who trace the actions oftechnosocia l collectives (or social worlds) working within a particular arena. Although I argue that knowledge systems come out of collective work, my focus here is not primarily on how particular facts about menopause have come to be stabilised or black boxed. but rather how the practices operating within the menopause clinic have come to be stabilised. I suggest that it is through examining the stabilisation processes of the practices of this site that an exploration of knowledge making and fact making can occur. ~I For example. see Clarke & Fujimura (J 992). Clarke & Montini (1 ()93). Clarke (19M9). Fujimura (1992) and Star (1992). l46 Ch. 7: orderings of the menopause clinic Employing \"standardised packages\" In the previous chapter I employed the boundary object of menopause as hormone deficiency to analyse how different technosocial collectives come together in the menopause clinic arena to participate in shared work. Fujimura (1992) proposes the concept of \u00abstandardised packages\" for examining both collective work and fact stabilisation . \"Standardised packages \" combines boundary objects with standardised technologies -a theory/methods analytical unit. In examining how, particular collectives come together and participate in shared work, the conceptual theory/methods tool of \"standardised packages\" offers particular benefits as it explores how interrelations become stable and how, from a wide range of possible actions, particular practices ensue, \"Standardised packages \" is a useful analytical tool with which to explore both the interrelations which exist between divergent technosocial collectives and the standardisation work of these collectives . My employment of \"standardised packages\" is not as an explanatory device but rather as an analytical one. I do not purport that the concept of \"standardised packagesn explains the origins of the stabilisation of the menopause clinic. Rather, it is one of many possible tools available to analyse the stabilisation processes in operation . With my focus on the practices of the clinic. the analytic lens of \"'standardised packages \" is used to examine how menopause as hormone deficienc y becomes clotted with the standardisation technologies of the clinic, Together . this \"'package\" shapes the stabilisation of this site and its network of relations. Encompassed within \"\"standardised packages\" is the work of standardising technologies. Unpacking these standardising technologie s, I am forced to consider their forms, production and linkages. I take the lead of Law and Mol (1995) as they explore notions of social-material production and suggest how these relations work both towards and against stability. Perhaps materialit y and sociality produce themselves together.. .. Perhaps, then. when we look at the social. we are also looking at the production of materiality . And when we look at materials, we are witnessing the production of the social. (Law & Mol, 1995, p.274) 147 Ch. 7; Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic The menopause clinic is a site of material and social co-production. I suggest that the standardising technologies operating within the menopause clinic are social-material technologies . As Mol and Law (1994) further suggest, these technologies operate in a fluid space. As with fluid elements, the composition of the elements of the clinic are not stable nor are their bonds with neighbourin g elements fixed. The nature of these technologies is contingent on the space and elements with which they interact. It is these interactions which are my primary interest. Generating power relations One of the questions that I want to tackle in this chapter is how conditions of power are generated through this process of stabilisation in the menopau se clinic. Following Fujimura (1991, p.222-223), I want to understand why certain groups are more or less powerful than others, why some actors resist being errrolled, and why some knowledge construct ions win over others. The menopause clinic arena is a political site, active in its co-construction of practices and knowledge making. I am interested in the power relations operating within the menopause clinic and how these power relations have, and are still, being generated. In Chapter 2 I discussed the analytical work in asking how and why questions. I emphasised the common g round shared by both the symbolic interactioni sts and recent social studies of science scholars in their attention to how questions over why questions . However , Fujimura (1992), typical of the many contemporary interactionist sciences studies scholars, feels compelled to ask both how and why questions in her work. Although my focus is on asking how menopause as hormone deficienc y and menopause clinics have come to be established, I argue that persevering with how questions inevitably answers why questions .G2 I suggest that the distinction between how and why questions is primarily methodological rather than one of principle. This methodological distinction tends to create an artificial division. I argue that how and why questions are perhaps more integrated than first appears. Dictionary definitions are interesting here with 'how' defined as \"for what reason; why\" (Macquarie, 1985), Ii: J am grmefuJ to John bringing lhis point to myattemion. 148 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic illustratin g the overlap between the two terms. How questions focus on practices and processes and are commonly action oriented -How does this work? Why questions , on the other hand, are those which ponder the reasons behiQ.d the actions, and which seek the cause or explanation for an act -Why is the work being done? My argument is that why questions arise from how questions. Specific to the menopause clinic, my persevering with practices and how the work of the clinic is done reveals the power relations of the clinic -the why questions. In examining the generation of power relations in the menopause clinic, I adopt a relational view of power rather than one based on hierarchies or professional authority. As Law (1994, p. 107) aptly states, \"power isn't a fluid that slops around, concentrating in particular places\", Rather, I view power relations in the menopause clinic as socially and materially constitutive. It is the interrelations between the various heterogeneous elements within the menopause clinic arena which give the capacity for agency. Importantly, just as agency is shaped, agency can also be unshaped . Agency is not fixed or detennined or necessarily stable over a long term, Like Foucault, I argue that power is not something that sovereigns , states, classes or professions possess in unequal quantities enabling some to exercise 'power over,63 others. Instead I take seriously the Foucauldian concept of capillary power64 -power generated through micro practices . My interest is on the power relations embedded in the practices of the menopause clinic. The analytic tool of \"standardised packages\" provides me with the necessary apparatus to examine the effects of the work of the boundary object of menopause as hormone deficiency . and the effects of the sociaJ-material technologies which work in conjunction with it. Power is generated and circulated through this combined package. It is in order to explore how this power is produced and works that I examine the mundane . and so often ignored, artefacts of the clinic . ... 1 See Barnes ( I YSX) ror his discussion on the concepl or social power. \"'1 For discussion or capillary power, see in particular Foucault (1976), Foucault (11)77) and Rabinow (1984). 149 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic Translation processes as a means of stabilising Focussing on the everyday social-material technologies in operation in the menopause clinic provides a way of examining the stabilisation of this network. These technologies act as translation processes , and through these translations , an outcome is produced. This outcome is the maintenance and strengthening of the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency and the stabilisation of the menopause clinic network, in which this understanding is so integrally related. Stabilisation is achieved through the work of the clinic's social-material practices as they represent, translate and mobilise the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency within the network. Rendering these representations mobile enables their extension outside the network, thus encouraging new potentia] alliances. The seam1essness and apparent stability of the menopause clinic are effects of this translation and mobilisation work. As the menopause clinic becomes increasingly stable, this work is rendered less and less visible. In examining these social-material practices, not only does this work become more visible, but it also becomes apparent that this outcome, which is the stabilisation of the menopause clinic, is only one of many possible outcomes . Scoring symptoms I begin, as many women do when seeJcing help during menopause, with the practices of infonnation seeking. Specifically , I discuss the practices of self help score charts, information seminars and questionnaires administered by some menopause clinics. These are all processes a woman encounters before she actually enters the clinic. The work of the \"standardised package\" is not confined to the geographical boundary of the clinic network, but extends far beyond it. Particularly troubling for many of the women panicipating in this study was their lack of understanding about what was happening to them. Many women who were newcomer s to the menopause clinic often did not associate the often confusing problems they were experiencing with menopause . To help alleviate this confusion , these women actively sought information about menopause . Score charts work to ease women's confusion about whether or not they are menopausal. These self assessment 150 Ch, 7: Stabilising lhe orderings of lhe menopause clinic charts are printed in infonnation brochures and newsletters on menopause and are widely circulated in health centres, general practice surgeries and promotional literature on menopause . Generally sponsored by phannaceutical companies6S, these score charts are presented either alone or together with information on \"HRT and the optimum management of menopause\" (Lifetime Menopause Newsletter, 1993, p.2). In addition, these score charts afe included in the many handbooks or self help guides now available on menopause. A scan of the covers of these books revea1s alluring statements, such as -\"Bonus inside. Is your body lacking oestrogen? Find out with Dr. Cabot's oestrogen level score chart.\" (Cabot, 1991). Under the heading of 'Oestrogen deficiency symptoms ', this oestrogen level score chart lists \"acute symptoms that are characteristic of the oestrogen deficiency syndrome of the menopause\" . These include the following : depression and mood changes, anxiety, fatigue, muscle pain, new facial hair, vaginal dryness, hot flushes, headaches and un10ved or unwanted feelings (Figure I). (,~ Examples or the inclusion or score charts in pharmaceuti cal company sponsored brochure s are !.!/etime Menopause Newsletter (1993). produced with the assistance or Upjohn. a pharmaceutical company which produces HRT. and Presenti/t~ a Posilivl!

If your score is around 3D, your body is crying out for oestrogen, Ref.: Cabot, S. (1991). Menopause . Hormone replacementtherapyand its natural alternatives . Melbourne: Women's Service. 152 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings ofthe menopause clinic Women completing the score chart are asked to score themselves (0-3) according to the severity of their symptoms. Upon completion, the woman's score is totalled and interpreted. If your total score for all of these is 15 or more, then it is likely that you are suffering from a deficiency of oestrogen. lfyour score is around 30, your body is crying out for oestrogen . This can be confirmed or refuted with a simple blood test to check your level of oestrogen and Follicle Stimulating Hormone (Cabot, 1991, p. 25). The score chart, like many of the technologies I examine, is a mundane entity. This seemingly ordinary paper artefact is taken for granted as it has become increasingly stabilised. However, its effects are far from mundane. It works to translate a woman's often confused experiences of menopause into oestrogen deficiency symptoms. The effects of this paper technology are to refrarne women's experiences and general malaise into a set of concrete symptoms for which she is urged to seek help for confirmation and possible treatment . ]n this way, women's understanding of their menopause is being shaped to fit the honnone deficiency package. Such technologies work to shape, direct and strengthen the stabilisation process of the menopause clinic. Examining these mundane entities reveals that they have serious social effects. Standardised seminars One of the objectives of menopause clinics in Australia is education about menopause targeted to both the general and medical community . To fulfil this objective, most clinics regularly conduct public seminars to provide information to the general community about menopause . These information seminars are very popular and well attended.<>6 Mary, who heads a public menopause clinic, gives an account of her role in giving community based information seminars on menopause . We went out and talked about menopause . It was obvious that this was the growth area. The menopause woman, maybe not so much now but 5 \u00b76 years ago, the menopause woman was like a kindergarte n child -an absolute sponge. M Depending on the menopause clinic. the cost or these information seminars are either free or a fee or A$5-$1O is charged Lo cover additional running expenses. 153 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic All they wanted was information, infonnation. information. \"I want to learn about everything that is happening to me, I want to learn about what is available\" , They still do. The Jean Hailes Foundation had a medical seminar and a public seminar a few weekends ago at the Radisson with Malcolm Whitehead67; we had 700 men and women at the public forum and there were 200 on the waiting list Women are still interested, although not many men are. (Mary, director of public menopause clinic) Although primarily designed as information seminars, these seminars invariably also act as promotional seminars for the clinics or medical practitioners conducting the seminar. These seminars are held in the general community as well as being directed to specific groups which comprise large numbers of menopausal women, such as school teachers, service industry workers and clothing industry employees . Of particular interest is the targeting of rural women in these information/promotion exercises. Women living in rural areas participating in this study commented on the paucity of services available to them in their local communities.68 Aware of this lack of existing services and potential market niche, some clinics particularly targeted rural women, with many practitioners going to these communities to provide information seminars. Other strategies employed by one private clinic included locaJ information seminars followed by provision of buses to transport large groups of menopausal women to the menopause clinic for individual assessment and management of their menopausal complaints. This seminar/clinic package was offered to women as a group outing to the city which included same day menopausal assessment. The women] interviewed taking part in this 'package deal' gave mixed responses to the provision of such a service. The women's comments ranged from being grateful to having access to a service which would otherwise not be available to thelT\\ to feeling concerned about being exploited by the clinic. I would never have gone ifit hadn't been for my sister in Shepparton (rural town). It would never have occurred to me to go {to the clinic) ... .I said to her, \" The advertising for this seminar described Malcolm Whitehead . as the Director of the Menopause Clinic at King's College Hospital. London and ~one of the world's leading e:\\\"\"j)Crts on HRT'. The seminar's promotions finnly located it ,,;thin the framework of menopause as homlOne deficiency . This seminar was titled MakinK (he most oJmenopause in the 90s. An oJiernoon \"7th the experts. (Jean Hailes Foundation NewsleUer. Sept. 1994). 611 I discuss the paucity of menopausal services in rural areas in greater detail in the final chapter. 154 Ch. 7: Slabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic \"why are you going to a menopause clinic because you've got osteoporosis \". That was my question. I would never have gone. My sister was very impressed with this and they brought buses down to collect all the people and all the women that were interested and I sort of, as I say Lhave a very suspicious mind having worked in newspapers for so long and I thought, a con job, gathering them all up and taking them down but maybe I'm being overly cynical really. (Gay) The one negative thing I heard after K 's lecture in Swan Hill was that she's advertising her business so is everything that she is saying, well .... But we're all individuals, we're all different and we should all realise that what affects one may not affect another and she opened things up for us, gave us an alternative. (Betty) The doctors in our community aren't in favour of ladies coming down because they say they can do everything apart from the bone density. (Beth) J guess some people must say that we're being exploited . but you have to keep it in perspective. (Cynthia) Women participating in this package deal, although appreciative of having services available to them, retained a degree of scepticism about their role in what they perceived to be largely a commercial enterprise. AJthough some of these seminars were constructed as a commercial exercise by some women, the content of the information seminars were positioned within a clearly defined medical and clinical framework . Mary outlined a typical community seminar which she had recently conducted . What I generally do is give an overall view of the bioio&'Y of menopause and what symptoms can occur and the psychosocial influences . Then J talk about management and going to see the doctor and what the doctor should do and what the infonnation the women should give, what tests might be recommended and what the treatment options are. I talk about lifestyle, exercise and alternative therapies and talk about HRT. (Mary, director of public menopause clinic) The emphasis on this, and other seminars I attended, was on the disease state of menopause , the problems experienced by women and the types of therapies available to alleviate these complaints . Much of the promotional and infoll11ation literature produced and provided by many of the clinics conducting these seminars shared this problem-oriented focus. 155 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of lhe menopause clinic The emphasis on menopause as an endocrine disease state works to shape women's personal experiences into standardised hormone deficiency symptoms . Women, like Marg, spoke about their relief in having their confused and messy experiences named and acknowledged. Marg: Well, I suppose it's not a thing that women talk about, so you know you hear about the change and you think yes, it would be great to be free from periods and that sort of thing and you know that you're going to have hot flushes. I mean really you don't hear of any other things. I suppose that's what came clearly through with K's talk -the broad scope of symptoms that she brought up 50 you know you can identify with some of the symptoms and you think jeepers yes. For some time now I've been prone to vaginal infections which make you feel positively unclean and this is another symptom that she was saying -the dry, itchy feeling that sort of thing that can be menopausal. My hair, I've developed a dry sort of rash in my hair; I thought, oh god I've never had that before. I shampoo my hair 3 times per week and I've always looked after my hair and suddenly I've got this. There were several symptoms that K was saying in her talk that I could identify with and suddenly you think, gee is this what I've got? Maybe I'm not going senile; I've got menopause. Marilys: Had you given much thought to what menopause may be like? Marg: No, I hadn't really until that talk, then possibly afterwards; that would be 6-8 weeks since I heard K. It's been constantly on my mind wondering, let's hope this is it. I suppose 1 thought, gee maybe this is it, maybe trus is the answer, maybe this is what I've got. I suppose I was hoping that with HRT if it looks like my levels are down that I'm going to get back on an even keel again. (Marg) For many women like Marg, the seminars were often the first time they had associated what they were going through with menopause. However , these seminars do more than just provide a name for women's previously unidentified experiences . These seminars translate and shape women's often messy experiences into a standardised package of menopause as hormone deficiency. This package comprises not only the particular understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency but also the standardised tools and technologies which co-construct this notion of menopause. This package channels women's expectations and decision making towards HRT and the various investigative and monitoring tools which have become part of the hormone deficiency model of menopause . Nell, like Marg, lives in a rural community and when I spoke to her, was attending the menopause clinic for the first time following the clinic's seminar. 156 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic I hope that the blood tests will show whether I need HRT or not and if so, I'll have it. I've really been looking forward to coming down; a feeling of well being; it' 5 made me feel really easy about things and just to know that there'5 people here that you can come to for your health. (Nell) Women like Nell who then decide to attend the menopause clinic after the clinic's seminar are thus primed with a hormonal understanding of menopause . The information seminar is a standardised technology , co-constructing and channelling decisions , practices and relations in particular directions . This standardised technology is not a single artefact like the score chart, but works as an integration of social, paper and rhetorical technologies whose outcome is to maintain the \"standardised package\" of menopause . Completing questionnaires Before a woman even attends the menopause clinic for her first appointment , the menopause package into which she is interpolated is standardised as one of hormone deficiency. This is further reinforced by those clinics who administered a questionnaire to women when they first made an appointment . Women were asked to complete this pre-set questionnaire and bring it wlth them to their first medical appointment. A typical questionnaire of this type poses the following questions: Why have you come to Clinic X? Choice of answers are: o menopause o premenstrual syndrome o menstrual difficultie s o premature cessation of periods o an evaluation of your hOnTlonal status o problems which you believe may be honnonal related o other A woman experiencing a complex and self perceived interrelated set of physical and psychological problems must categorise herself into a neat tick box. Her messy problems and complaints are narrowly redefined into a set of predetermined categories . A prospective clinic anendee is then faced with questions regarding her menstrual periods, previous use of HR T, and symptom profile (hot flushes, sweats, tiredness, 157 Ch. 7: Slabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic decreased sexual interest, dry skin & hair, vaginal dryness and poor concentration). Following this are questions relating to a family history of disease with an emphasis on gynaecological and breast problems. Presented with this standard frame of menopause , women are asked to construct their experiences i.nto a set of symptoms, more specifically hormonal related symptoms. Like the seminars, women responded to these Questionnaires in different ways. Most women completed the questionnaire in a manner which indicated their familiarity with this standardised medical process. Other women, like Jane, were pleased with the opportunity to have their problems taken seriously. The questionnaire gave you an opportunity to write down things your own 10eaJ doctor doesn't ask or doesn't have time to ask. You go to the general practitioner because you have one particular problem as a rule and that's all they have time for or want to hear about. There's so many questions there (in the questiormaire) that I answered . It wasn't because I was looking for miracle cures or wanting to go home with a bag of pills. I just wanted to knOw. You think that if you go with a sore throat or something. you don't feel as if you can ask your doctor anything else. He thinks you're a bit of a hypochondriac if you start asking these other questions. (Jane) Jane's response was typical of the many women whose menopausal complaints had either not been listened to, or taken seriously by their local general practitioner. Jane therefore eagerly completed the questionnaire, appreciative of the opportunity to ask \"these other questions \". In completing these questionnaires , women's experiences are further shaped into a model of menopause based on hormone deficiency . The use of these questionnaires clearly illustrate the move towards consolidating this notion of menopause. This seemingly mundane paper technology works to translate and simplify women's often messy experiences. The neat boxes and categories of this technology limit the possible interpretations ofa woman's experiences and channel the options available into particular directions . 158 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic Before a woman even enters the menopause clinic, material technologies such as score charts and questionnaires prime women to reframe and redefine their individual experiences and understanding of menopause into a model of menopause as honnone deficiency . These technologies mobilise the concept of menopause as hormone deficiency and work to reconstruct women's understanding of their experiences. Women's approaches in seeking help for menopausal complaints are shaped by these material technologies to fit the standardised medical hormone deficiency package. Consultation By the time a woman enters a menopause clinic she is likely to have already decided that she needs help to manage her menopausal complaints.69 Most women go to the menopause clinic with certain expectations that they will receive help and that their complaints , if not completely alleviated, at least will be appropriately managed. Most menopause clinics in Australia are located within a medical site, usually within or associated with a hospital. Even the private clinics, with their corporatised image and setting are modelled with a medical flavour. Women, well rehearsed with regard to medical consultations, are familiar with what is expected of them in the medical consultation at the clinic -they are there to have their problems identified, diagnosed and treated. The medical consultation follows a standard pattern. Following an often perfunctory greeting, the doctor ascertains the reasons for the woman's visit. This may be aided in some clinics by the questionnaires which the women complete prior to their consultation. The woman, having by this time reframed her messy experiences into concise symptoms offers these, with her body, for examination. Depending on the woman's presenting symptoms , certain examinations and investigative procedures follow, as deemed appropriate by the consulting doctor. From these findings, appropriate management infonnation is offered and therapeuti c direction outlined. The consultation is drawn to a close and the woman is left to fo') 40 or the 45 women who participated in individual interviews in this study claimed that they attended the menopaus e c1inie to seck help ror menopausal complaints. The remainder went to the clinic to seek information only aoout menopause. 159 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic reprocess this new information into her existing framework of understandi ng and experiences. This diagnostic and consultative process, framed within a medical context, is a standard approach familiar to both women and their care givers. What is of interest here is the framing of menopause within this well rehearsed medical scenario. Menopause , otherwise deemed as a nannallife event through which all women pass, becomes associated and positioned within a medical context. The work of managing menopause is constructed as medical work by those participating in this interaction . Determining hormone levels The <fact' of menopause as honnone deficiency is in part stabilised through its integration into various diagnostic tests. Technologies, such as hormone level detennination , operate as standardised tools that move easily between the various collectives in the clinic, Links are thereby construct ed between women, their consulting practitioners, pathology technicians, women's blood, various diagnostic machines, statistical norms and so fOr1h. Diagnostic tests have been developed to indicate whether or not a woman is menopausal . Measurement of raised follicle-stimulating hormones (FSH) in a woman's blood was thought to indicate that a woman had reached menopause (Burger, 1994; Coney, 1991, p.22S). Women's complex and often interrelated complaints around the time of menopause were thought to be able to be accurately diagnosed with the use of this sophisticated technolob'Y . However , despite some practitioners continuing to rely on this test for purposes of diagnosing menopause, there is now general agreement that this technolob'Y is oflittle diagnostic value, as hormone levels have been shown to fluctuate markedly during this period (Burger, 1994). Interpretatio ns ofhonnone measurements at this time are notoriously misleading, which is why most doctors prefer to rely on symptoms as the most useful guide to the stage of menopause . In a world where we rely on tests in so many areas, this may seem unsatisfactory. But the fact is that despite sophisticated hormone measuring systems, there is still no test to show that menopause is occurring or to predict just when the last menstrual bleed will take place. (Farrell & West more, 1993, p.28) 160 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic Despite attempts to standardise this technology as a diagnostic tool for menopause, difficulties were encountered in stabilising the entities which make up this technological network. The hormones in women's blood fluctuate and r:esist standardisation. Although one test ofa woman's hormonal levels may indicate that she is post menopausal, the next test may suggest that she is pre menopausal. Of interest is the reworking oftffis failed diagnostic tool into a monitoring instrument. Having proved unsuccessful as a tool for diagnosing menopause, serum honnone level determination is used widely to monitor hormones in women with HR.T implants. For women using implants, regular monitoring of their blood hormone levels is required to assess when the honnones administered in the implant have been depleted, and a replacement is required (Farrell & Westmore , 1993, pp. 25, 56). Women users of hormonal implants who attend menopause clinics become familiar with the routine of having a regular hormone blood test before their next clinic appointment. The result of the test ascertains their hormone blood level and detennines when they require a replacement implant inserted. This reworked monitoring technology translates women's hormones into a series of tangible test measurements . These calculations are transformed into decisions to keep women's hormone levels topped up through administration ofa new implant. Women too, take part in this translation work. Women on hormonal implants recounted the ways they read their bodies and interpreted these readings in terms of hormone deficiency . I always think I know when they (implants) are running out when T want to murder my husband~ I think it's time for another implant. I get really uptight. thought I was ready for one a few weeks back and yet when they did the test they said no, it wasn't and I didn't get one until last week. (Elsie) I sometimes feel as if I'm drained down .. They say it (last hormone level tested) was 3.1 and the normal is 2.2. You sometimes think to yourself that you're just about that close that you need topping up again but they (clinic practitioners) say no~ I don't know, they are the experts I suppose. You can tell when you're going down. If I go shopping , I start to get tired and my back will bend right down and 1 say to B (husband) , J know I'm getting low. You know when it's coming. (Elisa) 161 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic Women, like Elsie and Elisa, translate their body's signals, their emotions and their interactions into signs of hormone deficiency. Women's hormones, blood testing machines, medical practitioners, and the women themselves all participate and interact in this complex translation work. The facticity of menopause as hormone deficiency is stabilised through the \"standardised package\" of hormone testing. Social and material technologies work toget her and become closely intertwined in the stabilising of the menopause package. As this stabilisation occurs, the processes of translation, simplification and co-construction are rendered less and less visible. In bringing these processes to the foreground, the ways the orderings of the menopause clinic are stabilised is featured. Bone densitometry The practices which maintain the relations between osteoporosis and the menopause clinic have also produced a standardised package which locks bone densitometry together with the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency. I am alerted to the significance of bone densitometry results after the fifth woman I interview, Myra, enthusiastically fished through her bag for a copy of her results to show me. Like many of the other women I have spoken to in this study, Myra explained the graphic results to me, highlighting how her bone density had improved after having been on HRi'\u00b0 . Myra was 51 when' spoke to her. She is fair, has a small build and has a fragile, delicate appearance71 . 80th her mother and her grandmother had osteoporosis . Myra clearly remembered their pronounced rounded backs. At the age of 47, Myra started to collect information about osteoporosis , its risks and associated problems. She felt that as she was approaching menopause , and because of her family history of osteoporosis she needed to act to prevent herself going down the same path as her mother and grandmother . Myra had no 7\" Not all women. like Myra. showed improvement of their oone density. Many women were diS<lppointed by the lack or improvement after having been on HRT. However. of significance was their interest in the test results and its importance in their decision making whelher to stay on HRT or not. \"I Risk factors for osteoporosis are race (Asian and Caucasian women being at increased risk), small OOdy build and increasing age (Melton. 1990). 162 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings or the menopause clinic major menopausal complaints; her periods were a little irregular and her jOints ached sometimes but these were only minor problems. Unsuccessful in obtaining adequate information on osteoporosis from her general practitioner, Myra went to a menopause clinic. There she hoped to obtain some informed opinions -this was after a1/ a clinic in a large public teaching hospital with the appropriate knowledge and expertise . Myra was advised to have her bone density measured to ascertain the state of her bones. The bone density centre associated with the menopause clinic prided itself on having the latest technology -dual energy X-ray absorptiometty or DEXA as it is known in the trade. The test was simple and painless -lying on a couch whUe a scanning mechanical arm passed over Myra's body, measuring the bone density of her spine and hip. The radiographer performing the test also measured Myra's height and weight, which she entered into the DEXA computer, together with Myra's name, age, sex and ethnic group. The print out of the results from Myra's first bone scan declared that her bones were 80% of what they should be. Myra explained to me in detail the brightly coloured graph showing the bone density of her hip and spine compared to that of other women matched for age, weight and race (Figure 2: Bone denSity computerised results (DEXA)). eh, 7: Slabilising the orderings or the menopause clinic 163 Figure Bt1D (g/clll2:)1 411 AGE HECK % Young Adult2 HECK % Age Matched 3 HECK 68 811 (!:Iears) II1AG[ HOT fOR DIAGHI515 8.112 3 3 : BMC' (grams) = 4.51 AREA S (em' ) = 5.25 BMCs Z ---------------- ------------------ ------------- NECK 0.860 88 -1. 00 107 0.812 89 -0.76 122 1.12 'I'ROCH 0.929 ll8 1. 26 130 1. 96 See alJDp.l1dix [ on precision antl accurac.y.

On the basis of the outcome of this diagnostic test, Myra was prescribed oral HRT and was advised that she would have to take it for at least 10-15 years to prevent further bone loss. Myra recalls feeling bewildered foJ/owing her second consultation at the clinic. She had initially gone there just for information and she found herself walking out the door with medication which she was a little dubious of, and facing the prospect of at least 10 years of therapy. When I spoke 10 Myra she had been faking HRT for just over 3 yea~ for prevention of osteoporosis. Never having been fond of dairy foods as a child, Myra was also frying to increase her dietary calcium intake. Myra had recently had another bone scan. This time there was a slight improvement in her bone density, not as much as she had hoped but at least there wasn't further bone loss. The test result convinced Myra to stay on HRT for a while longer. However, Myra had been thinking more about the cancer risks associated with HRT. The bone scan was a tangible sign for Myra that her osteoporosis was caused by her decreasing levels of oestrogen. After weighing up the risks and benefits of HRT, Myra was swayed by the obvious improvement indicated by her bone density results and decided to stay on HRT, not for the rest of her life but at/east for a few more years. As I discussed previously, the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency is sufficiently malleable that it is able to enrol different technosocial collectives with often disparate local needs and investments . The understanding of menopause held by groups orwomen differs from that held by bone densitometrists . Women, like Myra, come to the clinic with an understanding of menopause as a complex, interrelated set of problems . To bone densitometrists, menopause is something that can be measured in terms of bone loss. What brings these groups together is the work of the boundary object of menopause as hormone deficiency which is plastic enough to enable menopause to be worked in different local contexts and yet is robust enough to maintain a common interface. Both the women and bone densitometrists are enrolled into the clinic arena through the reshaping of their understanding of menopause into one of menopause as hormone deficiency . For women, this reworking is enabled through the use of social-material technologies including seminars, score charts and 165 Ch. 7: Stabilising thcordcrings of the menopause clinic blood hormone tests. However , it is the bone density chart72 with its graphic representation of a woman's spatial position in relation to a set of norms that provided many women with a visual sign of their lacking oestrogen. For the bone densitometrists, bone loss is constructed as an e~ect of menopause . The linkage of HRT as a preventive agent of bone loss extends this construction of menopause . Menopause is remodelled from a condition of bone loss to one of hormone deficiency. This remodelling of menopause thus engineers hormone replacement as the solution to the problem of hormone deficiency. Recall Myra's story -her family history of osteoporosis and her concern that she, like her mother and grandmother, may also suffer from it. It was for this which Myra first sought help. In the menopause clinic the material and the social are continually being worked and reworked. Myra's fragmented menopause undergoes reshaping and remodelling into a menopause characterised by hormone deficiency . The bone density scan becomes a material sign of hormone deficiency . The coloured paper chart issued from the bone scanner is not restricted to whether Myra's bones are healthy or poor; rather it is used to indicate whether HR T is required or not. Having become the material sign of hormone deficiency, bone loss becomes a new focus of Myra's decision making about the management of her menopause . Having initially entered the menopause clinic solely for the purpose of seeking information about osteoporosis, Myra, through the use of the bone density technology. is constructed as \"at risk\" of developing osteoporosis. Myra recalled her surprise in leaving the menopause clinic with a prescriptiun of HR T when she had injtially gone there just for information. I had gone to the menopause clinic wanting to get more information and I was virtually put straight on HRT, or after the first visit when I had tests and things. In a way I was a bit shocked because they seem to have taken it for granted that's what I wanted and didn't really tell me if there were any alternatives . But from what I've read, I sort offeh that it probably was inevitable but they didn't seem to tell me of anything else that J might have ': The colours of the bone density chart arc carcrully chosen to indicate the danger of low bonc mass. Red is used for the lowest bone density range, moving towards the speclrum of cool blues and greens of the \"nonnal\" and high bone density range, I am grateful to Peter Shorl for pointing this oulto mc. 166 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings oflhe menopause clinic done and not gone on to HRT. They just seemed to take it for granted that was to happen. (Myra) This co-constructed association between bone densitometry and hormone deficiency results in the routinisation of bane density scans for the management ofmenopausaJ women. In many menopause clinics, bone density scans have become standard, routine practice for the screening of women before they commence therapy, and for monitoring once hormonal therapy is commenced. The apparent acceptance and lack of questioning of this practice highlights the stabilisation of the relations which have been constructed within the menopause clinic. Despite the precariousness in the development of this technology, screening and monitoring of osteoporosis in the menopause clinic has become standardised . The social-material working of women's bones, bone scans and HRT stabilises the network of relations within the menopause clinic. In this process of stabilisation, the reading of women's bones is restricted to their relation to hormone deficiency . Other readings, such as their association with prevention of fractures rather than with the use of hormonal therapy are deleted, as the network of relations becomes more and more stable. Naturalising hormone replacement The use of hormone replac:emellf therapy for either treatment or prevention requires reconceptualising HRT from an intervention to a form ofrestoration .13 The use of fiR T for the management of menopausal complaints or the prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease is an intervention in the process of menopause . Naming this intervention as hormone replacemellf transforms the action into a process of reslOration back to a state of normality . Replacement implies replenishing something deficient -in this case, hormones . Reconceptualising hormonal therapy from intervention to restoration erases the articulation work involved in this transformation, as well as its associated outcomes . ,~ I was interested to rend or\\\"an der Ploeg's (1995) examinalion or rcconceptualising various medical in relation to reproductive technolo~,'y. 167 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic Tessa, a woman concerned with having to remain on HRT, articulated this reworking ofHRT. Tessa: 1 am concerned The thought of taking any drug long term does worry me. I guess when I first started treatment because it's called HRT you don't think of it as a drug; it's only when you look into it more and I suppose after talking to the naturopath too about the symptoms, yOll think there's a drug going through your body constantly and I thought yes, that's what I don't like. MarHys: I'm interested in you not thinking ofHRT as a drug. Tessa: Yes, it's stupid, isn't it. r don't know what I thought of it as. I knew that it was replacing a hormone that I'm obviously not producing enough of\u00ad oestrogen . I don't know; it wasn't until I bought the first box that I thought this is a drug that I'm putting into myself every day slowly -slow release. (Tessa) For some women, this notion ofHRT as a replacement device towards a normal state served to de-emphasise the idea ofHRT as a drug with side effects. Marg was surprised that she had not considered that HR.T was associated with side effects. I hadn't really thought that there were side effects really. I just naturally thought that it fitted in and it was replacing something in your body that you were losing at a fast rate. I never thought there were side effects. I guess that's something that I hadn't really thought of. (Marg) With HR T, the rhetoric of replacement works to naturalise the use of an intervention therapy. As Tessa stated, when she first commenced fIRT she did not think of it as a drug, but rather as a replacement of her deficient hormones . This kind of conceptuali sation exemplifie s the simplifying practices integral to the process of stabilisation . Naming hormonal therapy as a replacement maintains the model of menopau se as deJicil!m..:y. The use of hormonal therapy as replacement is imbued with a certain taken for granted ness. Such rhetorical technologies move these practices beyond question, a necessary move for the stabilisation of relations in the menopause clinic. 'Natural' HRT \"Ogen is a \"natural\" way of giving her back what nature's taken away.\" (Abbott Australasia) \"Estrogen as natural to her body as the estrone it restores.\" (Advertisement for Ogen, Abbott orderings of the menopau se clinic UEstraderm patches release the natural human hormone oestradiol directly into the blood stream in much the same way as premenopausal ovaries,\" (Ciba Geigy) Recent advertisements for HRT appearing in the medical literature characteristically promote the 'naturalness' of hormonal therapy. Targeting the medical community who prescribe these agents, HRT is portrayed in these advertising campaigns as <natural' replacement s to women's own depleted hormones. The characterisation ofHRT as 'natural' is both questionable and problematic . The contentious classificatio n of hormones as natural by the phannaceutical industry14 is further discussed by Westmore (1994, p.36), where she suggests that the industry's use of 'natural' is a synonym for safe. Coward (1989, p. 18) adds to this in her discussion of the construction of natural as wholesome and pure and standing in sharp contrast to 'synthetic'. In their bid to improve sales of honnona1 therapy following the depleted sales resulting from the associatio n of oestrogen and cancer, the marketing ofHRT as 'natural' attempted to link the concepts of 'natural' with good health and safety. RecaU Tessa's concern about using oestrogen patches on a long term basis: I'm still not keen on staying on these patches; the fact that it's a drug and it's fake oestrogen going into your body .... Eventually, my hope is to get off the patches altogether and stick to the natural and take the natural on its own. (Tessa) Tessa, along with two thirds of the women in the study15 had tried or were currently using some form of alternative 'natural' therapy, either alone or with combination with HRT These women were seeking a 'natural' form of therapy to alleviate their '1 Although oestrogen lhcrap~ was derived from organic sources in its carly development. first from the urine of prcgnant women. then from the urinc of pregnant mares. the oestrogen component of HRT in its currcnt form is chemically s~\"thcsi5Cd . Thcjustifica lion of the 'natural' label ofHRT by the medical and pharmaceutical industry is due to the synthesised product having a structure similar to the oestrogcns found in the body. E.'\\.i1mples of 'natural pA2), Weslmore (1994) notes. the construction and characterisation of HRT as 'natural' is an uncommon phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry. For example. insulin which is derived from recombinant DNA tcchnology using organic matcrial as its !lasc. is not promoted as 'natural' insulin. but rather is known as 'human' insulin. H ]() of the *5 women inten'iewcd in the stud:'o\u00b7 had used or were currently using one or a combination of naturopathic remedies. massage. vitamins. yoga. acupuncture. meditatio n. or chiropraclic. This use of alternative therapies to manage menopause is discussed further in Chapler R. Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic menopausal complaints which would not jeopardise their long term health. The promotion ofHRT as 'natural' attempts to naturalise or make normal the use of hormonal therapies in the management of menopause. Cathy commented on her response to the promotion ofHRT as a 'natural' therapy. 169 They say the natural hormone is better -Premarin. It's the hormone from the horse; I thought 1'd be racing around. Natural has to be best. (Cathy) The rhetorica l technolog ies construct ing HR.T as a natural replacement to women's depleted hormones attempt to naturalise the use of honnonal therapy in the management of menopause . Naturalising these practices reities both the practices and the particular understanding of menopause within which these practices are co\u00ad constituted. Individualising HRT In the previous chapter, I discussed the development of new dosages and formulations ofHRT to simplify the prescribing ofHRT for medical practitioners. This strategy however is a double move on the part of the pharmaceut ical industry. The availability of these new dose combinations not only makes it easier for prescribing practitioners, but it also appeals to the individualisation of menopausal women. Women going through a 'natural' menopause are perceived to have individual problems, responses and oulcomes . Similarly. women are noted to have individual responses to HRT. As the promotion for the new Menorest patches states, \u00abThis woman says it feels funny .. .This woman thinks it's too big ... This woman needs a different dose .... \" (the patch 10 match, 1995). In providing this new range of hormone formulations , the side effects resulting from inappropriate dosages are overcome. HRT is constructed as more able to meet women's individual needs. Many women commented on these new formulations and expressed a desire for a \"tailor made,,16 version ofHRT. 7,. Although women panicipating in the study lalked about \"tailor made\" HRT, this description is a misnomer. B~' supplying an increased number or hormone dosages than previously (4 concentrations rather than one). lhe pharmaceutical industry provides greater De.,ibility in altering dosages. However. the honnonc dosage is not tOlally individualised to the panicular 170 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic r hope they can help me because I was on HR T and it didn't agree with me. I just hope they can find a tailor made version. (Gwen) I've been on HRT and Ijust can't take it. There must be something to suit me. If! go back (to my general practitioner), he says too bad. I want one (HRT) tailor made for myself I had very sore breasts and I couldn't put up with it any longer, sore nipples, I couldn't even ron over in bed. It was the smallest dose possible. I didn't even go back because I didn't know any different but now I do know that you can get different ones. K (in clinic seminar) said about patches so I'm going to be so rapt if I can have something like that because I really want to go on them because I don't want to grow old. I don't want to get dry skin which I've got now, dry hair. I'd love to be able to take them. (Marion) In administering these new HRT formulations, it is claimed that side effects resulting from inappropriate dosages, such as Marion's sore breasts, can be overcome. As 1 discuss later, one of the reasons women fail to comply with the recommended prescription of fIR T is because of side effects. The individualisation ofHRT by the pharmaceutical industry is an attempt to surpass women's lack of compliance to HRT and resist opposition to its use. HR T is constructed as an individual solution to a woman's individual problems. In so doing, this strategy works to maintain and strengthen the position of this form of therapy within the menopause network. Surveillance Due to the associated risks of endometrial and breast cancer with HRT, it is strongly recommended that women on this therapy are monitored periodically for these diseases. Monitoring for endometrial cancer is perfonned using one or more of the following types of technologies : endometrial biopsy, trans vaginal ultrasound and/or dilatation and curettage. For breast cancer, clinical and self breast examination are recommended together with periodic mammography (Grady, Cummings, et aI., 1992, p.I039_40)77. In addition to the surveillance technologies used primarily for purposes These surveillance tcchnologies arc recommended to be performed regularly for bolh women on HRT as well as menopausal women generally_ as the incidence of breast cancer increases with age. M:nsh & Whitehead (1992) in UK describe the protocol in their menopause clinic as breast and pchic examinations e\\\u00b7ery 12-18 months. a mammogram every J years in low risk women and more frequently for women in high risk categories. and bone density measurements. 171 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic of monitoring , are the various technologies used to diagnose abnonna1ities, such as bleeding or pelvic pain, which may result from the use ofHRT. Technologie s such as mammography and ultraso~nd are visual technologies . A woman's breast, uterus and ovaries are transformed into visual images using this type of technology. As Petchesky (1987) notes in her account offoetal imagery, the constructed cultural nature of these images is often overlooked as focus is placed on the overwhelming scientific guise of these technologies . These technologies are performed for purposes of medical diagnosis or monitoring, the material result used to determine future management. However, the visual images arising from technologies such as mammograph y and ultrasound work to reconstruct women's view of their bodies. Kay spoke of the shock she feft when she viewed the ultrasound of her ovaries. Being infertile and wanting to have a child, Kay had been on the In Vitro Fertilisation (fVF) programme for many years and been on \"masses of hormones\" as part of this programme. At the age of 38, Kay was surprised to find herself experiencing signs of menopause. Although she was not convinced that what she was experiencing was menopause, she agreed to start therapy. She was prescribed more hormones, this time to alleviate her menopausal complaints. As a result of HRT, Kay began to experience \"side effects\" -breast soreness and pelvic pain for which it was suggested she have a pelvic ultrasound and mammogram. I spoke with Kay fol/owing her ultrasound. This scan this morning, they could hardly see my ovaries at all. J know that your ovaries shrink of course. That was quite a shock for me too to find that my ovaries have shrunk so much. I've had loads of ultrasound while J was going through IVf. That was another realisation that here you are, 10 years since I had one, but 10 years ago my ovaries were showing up pretty well, but now today they could hardly find the darn things. I was aware that your ovaries do shrink, J knew that but it's not something that you consciously thinking about until it's pointed out. (Kay) For Kay, viewing her 'shrunken' ovaries was a confirmation that she was menopausaL This visual technology becomes a material sign of menopause , signified by the shrunken ovaries. The ultrasound, perfonned for purposes of investigating Kay's 172 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the me~opause clinic pain, is reconstructed as evidence of menopause represented by the shrunken ovaries. The shrunken ovaries with their association of shrinking hormone production thus reaffinns the menopause as hormone deficiency package. For women like Kay, uncertain whether their experiences are associated with menopause , visual technologies such as ultrasound scans are used as confirmation of menopausal status. In addition, these visual technologies work to co-construct women's identity as menopausal. Shrinking ovaries, bone loss, possib1e breast tumours -all visualised with these various technologies, construct a picture of the menopausal woman as the stereotypical aging woman complete with dowager's hump, so often portrayed in the promotional literature of the 1960s7H. Visual technologies, such as ultrasound , mammography and bone scans all work together with the hormone deficiency model of menopause to stabilise the \"standardised package\" of menopause . These visual material technologies work to represent the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency , and furthermore . to enable its mobilisation both within and outside the clinic network. These technologies are not restricted to diagnosis or monitoring for which they are primarily performed , but result in social effects which act to reinforce the menopause package. Generating power relations In the previous sections r have discussed how the collective work of the menopause clinic becomes stabilised. Using the conceptual tool of \"standardised packages\" my focus has been on the standardis ing technologies and practices of the clinic which work in conjunctio n with the understanding of menopause as honnone deficiency. I have shown how this theory/practice combination maintains and strengthens the interrelations of the clinic. I tum now to the second issue addressed in this chapter, namely. the power relations generated in the menopause clinic. There are three key points on which I will elaborate. First, that power relations are generated through practices and that it is through the examination of practices that an understanding of power relations is realised. Second. practices occur from the interrelations of 71:1 For examples of these stereotypical images, see Wilson (1966) and Wilson & Wilson (11J6J). 173 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic heterogeneous elements; these are social-material interrelations involving often mundane artefacts and entities. My last point concerns the lack of stability of power relations. Just as agency can be shaped through the interrelations between heterogeneous elements, it can also be unshaped through these same interrelations . It is these processes of destabilisation that I make the focus of the following chapter. Generating power through practice Issues of social power have been of major concern to sociologists. Sociological debates around the issue of power have primarily centred around the role of macro sociologica l structures versus micro processes and agency. Law (1991), in his use of the term 'power over', refers to the structural distribution of power which has been the focus of much ofsociolo!;,>y. In contrast. Law centres his interest on 'power to' as an enabling phenomenon. Law draws on the works of Foucault (1976, 1977) and Barnes (1988) in his elaboration of power as an \"added capacity for action\" (Law, 1991, p.167). As I have argued previously, I do not wish to exclude considerations of macro structural power or 'power over' from my analysis. For example, I do not wish to totally dismiss accounts of professio naJ authority or economic privileging to analyse issues of medical dominance, as such accounts offer useful insights. However , my interest is on notions of capillary power and power generated through practice. The examples discussed in the previous sections illustrate the power relations which are generated through these practices . My argument is that power and agency are relational , arising oul of sets of interrelations. These interrelations generate power effects, effects often very different from those strategically intended. This is clearly exemplified by the bone density scan used to assess the degree of bone loss in a woman's hip or spine. The use of this technolog y in the menopause clinic does much more than assess the density of women's bones; it becomes the focus ofa woman's decision whether to remain on HRT or not. Women's use of the menopause score charts to seek infonnation about menopause is transformed into the degree to which her body is <'crying out for oestrogen \". These practices work in conjunction with the Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic notion of menopause as hormone deficiency, resulting in important power effects. Placing the focus on practice reveals the power effects generated. Heterogeneity and power relations 174 \"Agency is the ability of human heings to make a difference in the world\" (my italics) (Layder, 1994, p. 5). As Latour (1988b) points out, for much of sociology, agency has only been an issue for human actors. My focus is on the interrelations of the heterogenous elements of the menopause clinic. As J argued earlier. I am interested not only in social interactions but also in the effects of mundane entities which work relationally with social elements. Law (1991, p.166) claims that \"what we call 'social' relations is never purely social\". The social works in relation with the material, the rhetorical, the technological . the textual and so forth. The issue of attributing agency to non humans has been a concern in science studies in recent years.79 Recently . Casper (1994) added to this debate in her discussion of foetal surgery. She asks how do entities become socially configured as human, non human or other, and how do we, as humans. seriously take up the issue of non human agency, without relying on human-centred conceptions of power. I am aware of attributing the various technologies of the menopause clinic categories of human or non human. all in relation to my own situated ness as human. Despite this constraint on my analysis, I pursue the interaction s of the human, non human, and cyborg elements occupying the clinic. In this way, I do not wish to grant agency to non human elements, nor do I want to privilege the agency of humans. My primary interest is not on the categorisation of whether something is human, non human or other, or whether each of these categories is necessarily granted agency. As many scholars have shown, this system of categorisat ion becomes increasingly problematic in our socio technological world as boundarie s between these various categories become notably blurred.80 My focus therefore is on the interactions between these various elements. I do not limit my focus 1'> For c.\"'tcndcd discussion on this. (1992b, the catcgories of human. nonhuman :.md other. sec Haraway 7: Stabilising the orderings ofthc menopause clinic only to social interactions but include a spectrum of social-material interrelations. It is through the interrelations of these heterogeneou s elements I suggest, that meanings are constructed and agency is shaped. The example of the ultrasound illustrates this point. The visual technology of the ultrasound with its graphic representation of a woman' 5 ovaries is read as shnmkell ovaries - a construction of menopause as hormone deficiency . It is not the categorisation of Kay as human and the ultrasound as non human81 which is of interest to me here, but rather, that the interactions between these two elements produces a particular kind of meaning about menopause . Kay reads her ultrasound picture in terms of'shrunken ovaries' and constructs herself not only as menopausal , but as suffering from failing ovarian function. The ultrasound picture becomes a material sign of Kay's hormone deficiency . This construct ion of Kay's ovaries as shrunken and deficient shapes and directs the flow of decisions which Kay and her physicians make regarding the management of her menopause. It is through the interactions between artefacts such as ultrasound and other kinds of elements, human and non human, that meanings are produced and agency generated. Shaping and unshaping agency In his analysis of how power effects are generated , Law (1991) proposes that relations must be stabilised, even momentarily , for power to be generated . This stability of relations results in storage of power - a storage of power to act (Law uses money as an obvious example of power storage). r would agree that stability of relations does result in a degree of power storage. However, it is the destabilising of relations which is of interest to me. J have suggested that agency is shaped through the interrelations of the various heterogenous elements of the menopause clinic. Furthermore , I argue that it is also ~I The gmnting or personhood to the ultrasound scan picture is raised by Casper (I ()()4) as she discusses the usc or this technology in constructing foetuses as humans and specifically gcndcrcd persons. 176 Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic through interactions and practice that agency is unshaped . My focus in this chapter has been on the stabilisation of the menopause clinic. In the following chapter I argue that despite a certain degree of stability (and power storage), the network of relations of the menopause clinic is not fixed but exists in a state of flux. Using examples of destabilising practices operating in the clinic, the next chapter will elaborate these points. Summary Fundamentally , my thesis is on how it is when we consider an understanding of menopause as a nonnallife event, that we have come to have specialised, medical sites such as menopause clinics. How have menopause clinics come to be, and how has the work of the menopause clinic come to be stabilised? These are the questions tackled in this and the previous chapter. In addressing these questions , I have focussed on the practices and interactions of the various heterogenous elements of the menopause clinic. This examination of the clinic's practices has demonstrated how the various standardisation technologies of the clinic work in conjunction with the understanding of menopause as honnone deficiency. These practices show how the \"standardised package\" of menopause hangs together, resulting in a stable network of relations . Stabilisation processes are commitment processes. reflecting a flow of decisions toward the usage of particular tools in particular ways in particular situations' (Clarke & Fujimura , 1992, p. 13). The network of relatiolls oflhe menopause clinic has become increasingly stabilised as certain practices and decisions are shaped along panicular directions The stabilisation process has resulted in the possible range of actions and decisions being narrowed and restricted to particular directions . The stabilisation of the menopause clinic is a power effect of a highly politicised arena. Examination of (he practices from which these power effects are generated makes visible this flow of decisions and this process of simplification and reification. My focus on the clinic's practices have shown how agency is generated through the interrelat ions between the heterogeneous entities of the clinic. Agency is shaped relationally. However, this shaping is not fixed, nor inherently stable. In the same Ch. 7: Stabilising the orderings of the menopause clinic way that agency can be shaped, it can also be unshaped . It is this unshaping that offers potential for change in the menopause clinic and provides opportunities for different practices and different ways of knowing. It is to this unshaping and destabilising that I tum in the next chapter. 177 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions lo the standardised menopause package Chapter 8 -Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package And that what we thought were stabilities are -!Instable. What we thought had direcliol1-shakes and quivers. (Law & Mol, 1995, p.275) Introduction 178 In the two preceding chapters I have outlined the ways in which a'number of very disparate collectives come together to construct and maintain the menopause clinic. Despite their very different local needs, sets of practices and investments , these groups work collectively to build a set of relations within the clinic locale. T have argued that it is the socio-material practices and interactions between these sets of disparate groups that leads to the stabilisation of the clinic network. This stabilisation process results in the standardisation, reinforcement and reification of the menopause as hormone deficienc y package. The clinic practices I have described work to standardise this package and stabilise the network of relations of the clinic. The operations and nested routines of the menopause clinic attempt to channel the flow of commitments and decisions of the clinic's network of relations. Despite these concentrated efforts to stabilise the menopause clinic, this network nonetheless \"shakes and quivers\". Through the examination of the everyday local practices of the clinic network, disruptions to the stabilisation process become visible. At each local point within the network, the standardised menopause package is worked and reworked. New practices and elements are inserted and existing ones reshaped , modified and possibly erased. [nterruption s and disruptions occur to the general flow of events and commitment processes of the menopau se clinic. As Law and Mol (1995) suggest, it is in being aware of local links and partial connection s that different imagining s become possible. It is to ask about the possibility that there are partial connections . Partial and varied connection s between sites, situations, and stories. This, then, is the patchwork option. ]t's to imagine that materials and social-and stories too-are like bits of cloth that have been sewn together. It's to imagine that there are many ways of sewing. It's to imagine that there are many kinds of thread. It's to attend to the specifics of the sewing and the thread. It's to attend to the 179 Ch. 8: Tracing disruption s to the: standardised menopause package local links. And it's to remember that a heap of pieces of cloth can be turned into a whole variety of patchworks. By dint oflacal sewing. ICsjust a matter of making them. (Law & Mol, 1995, p. 290) An interactionist science studies approach with its focus on practice and collective work draws attention to the local links and connections. In tracing how the menopause clinic has come to be established, I have followed its construction and stabilisation through the everyday practices of the clinic. I maintain that it is also through the examination of these practices and processes that interruptions and abrasions can be traced and possibilities for change can emerge. Unlike the employment of macro sociological theoretical perspectives in which fonnulating strategies for change often appear far removed from the concrete tasks and activities of actual practice, an interactionist approach is rooted in pragmatism and the processes in action. Blurring the boundaries of knowledge and practice, an interactionist approach sets as its focus the practices with which knowledge claims are inextricably linked (Clarke & Fujimura, 1992). Seeing both the notion of menopause as a hormone deficiency and menopause clinics as constructions highlights that they are only one of many possible outcomes of collective work. Other ways of imagining menopause are possible and being attentive to partial connections enables these different imaginings. Fox (] 993), writing about a postmodemist organisation of health, alerts us to the point that resistance i s ubiquitous , occurring in everyday practices and narratives . Examining the everyday practices of the menopause clinic reveals the ambiguities of these practices ; they are simultaneously resistant and compliant. Practices such as women's very attendance at menopaus e clinics appears as an act of compliance . However, closer focus on women's discourse, their multiple understandings and their particular practices reveal challenges and resistance to the \u00abstandardised package\". Berg (1995a) makes the point that different tools/practices carry different rationalitie s. Denouncing any sense of essentialism in the design and use of tools and practices , Berg suggests that within practices are many different rationalities and considerations, leading to multiple paths of action. It is by being attentive to these multiple rationalities of practices that different readings become possible. 180 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package The menopause clinic arena is a highly politicised site. I argued earlier that persevering with how questions, such as how menopause clinics have come to be, also reveals why they have come to be. The power relations of the menopau se clinic are of interest and importance to me as an analyst I am interested that certain groups, certain decisions and certain ways of understanding are employed over others. I have suggested that it is the interrelations between the various heterogeneou s elements of the clinic which give the capacity for agency and that agency is shaped and generated thIough practices. Just as agency is shaped, it can also be unshaped. It is through the practices of the clinic that this unshaping and reshaping of agency can be traced, and other ways of doing, seeing and knowledge making can follow. The local disruptions not only jeopardise the stabilisation of the clinic and threaten the power relations generated, but also challenge the authority of the standardised menopause package. This type of analysis which attends to these local links also has ramifications for power relations at a macro level. Although my analysis centres on interruptions to local practices and connections, it has implications for wider women's health policy concerns. 1 have demonstrated how the standardised technologies of the menopause clinic, together with the understanding of menopause as hOnTIone deficiency, enable the menopause \"standardised package\" to hang together. I now change tack and suggest that both the boundary objects and the standardised technologie s which make up the menopause package are susceptib le to challenges and disruptions . I have argued previously that the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency as a boundary object enabled the coming together of the various technosocial collectives of the clinic as well as acting as a translating device between these various groups. However , Fujimura (1992) reminds us that meanings are not embodied in boundary objects. Characteristic of boundary objects are their elasticity and ability to be reshaped and reworked in local contexts. Thus, because of this elasticity, boundary objects have a \"wide margin of negotiation \" (Fujimura , 1992, p. 175). r will show how the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency in the menopause clinic is taken up by marginal groups, such as naturopaths and psychologists, and worked and reshaped within their local contexts and framework . In addition, I address the local lSI Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package clinic practices and attend to their ambiguities, contradictions and multiple potentialities . I focus on how the menopause package is reworked locally and how power relations are renegotiated . Specifically, I examine the tensions in women's constructions of menopause, the ambiguities involving the use ofHRT and finally, I focus on groups which occupy the margins of the clinic arena and the ways they interrupt the flow of operations and decision making within the clinic network. Embodying tensions in the construction of menopause Although the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency works to bring together different technosocial collectives in the menopause clinic, this particular understanding of menopause is itself fraught with tensions and ambiguities. Boundary objects are not fix.ed but are reworked in local contexts and situations . In this section, I explore women's constructions of menopause and the juxtaposition of the standardised menopause account to the messiness and complexity of women's lives during menopause. Within the menopause clinic, practices and places are remodelled by women and physicians alike. Women's ambivalence towards the standardised technologies of the clinic becomes apparent- women question, ponder and challenge the use of these technologies as they seek to manage their menopause. In my discussion of women's experiences of menopause , I am reminded of the historical and cultural constructions of 'experience ' (Scott, 1992). This feminist critique of , experience ' highlights the problems in using experiential accounts, in this case women's accounts, as a basis for distinguishing what is real and true. S2 In my use of women's stories and experiences, I do not grant these accounts more or less authority and authenticity than any other accounts. I acknowledge that women's experiences are also constructions , are not homogeneous and not imbued with any essential feminine characteristics . Given these limitations, these accounts are nonetheles s useful in emphasising how women's understanding about menopause is I<~ Jennircr Harding (11)1)1) clearly articutates this point in hcr usc of stories of post menopausal women discussing their views of ageing and HRT. Harding emphasises that the inclusion or women\u00b7s voices in her work is not only to give women a chance [0 speak ror themselves . but also to use these accounts to examine how women\u00b7s subjectivity , together with their experiences. are constructed and under what circumstances these posilions are made. 182 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions 10 the standardised menopause package reworked within a local context. The following accounts of women and workers of the menopause clinic highlight the ambiguities and multiple rationalities within the clinic and suggest sites of social and material resistance within the clinic network. Messiness of menopause The < official' account of menopause as a period characterised by hormone deficiency is seamless, neat and ordered. Women's accounts of menopause suggest another type of understanding -an understanding of menopause as complex, messy and confused. Women's stories speak of juggling multiple demands and concerns -caring for elderly parents, managing teenage children and partners' midlife crises, maintaining work careers, working through changes in identity and life direction -all compounded by the physical and emotional stresses of menopause . Assigning a cause for these problems is difficult. Women question which, if any, of their problems is menopause related. Equally difficult is neatly categorising these experiences and problems within the confines of particular organ systems. Tensions arise in designating these complex problems as physiological, psychological or emotional. The following quotes are from women describing their experiences of menopause. Marian, having experienced serious problems associated with menopause for the last ten years, expressed her inability to conveniently separate her problems into neat categories . The problem is that part of the symptoms are depressive anyway~ the vagueness, the emotiona l state and all that, the lack of self esteem, the lack of confidence -they're part of it. Where is the depressive state and where is the symptom state\" It's written down as part of the symptoms so where is the fine line\" (Marian) Carol voiced the stresses she faced during menopause and questions how, and if, they all fit together. Around that time (ten years ago) things were really bad and I was in a rocky slate anyway. But I think definitely those signs (of menopause) were there ~ that long ago; I was 45. I was also looking after my husband's mother who was very badly demented . That was quite heavy going so there was a lot of other emotional stuff as well ... Amid all that there was all this trouble with my 183 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package husband and I wasn't really coping very well. I had mentioned this to K (menopause clinic physician) a few times that I'm still going to therapy; I've been going for three years. Amidst all that 1 rediscovered an incest problem. It's been quite devastating actually and so I'm still dealing with all that as well. I often wonder how much is ... if all that was over if every1hing would be ... I don't know. The emotional stress during that period of time, cbangingjobs and moving to Melbourne. With all this going on at the same time, it's very hard to tell. There is a direct connection with my emotional state. (Carol) Carol's experience of revisiting past episodes of abuse was not uncommon in my interviews with women in this study. A number of women volunteered infonnation to me regarding past incidents of emotional , physical and sexual abuse. often experienced as children, which they claimed they were unable or unwilling to deal with at the time. The burden of child rearing, work and partnerships were reasons these women cited for not having previously dealt with these issues. Now facing menopause, these women found they needed to address these problems before they were able to move on in their lives. Kate and Tess described the messiness of menopause and its impact on their lives. Apparent is the frustration felt by these, and other women, as they attempted to seek help to resolve the problems they were experiencing . I see it as being chaotic and messy and it's not been for me an easy stage of my life. It's been fraught with being put off by doctors and being dismissed and causing me to go around and around looking and seeking information and treatment for myself. So I see it as being something which has been quite chaotic and messy. That's what that means to me -chaotic, confusing, messy time that should not be like that. (Kate) I don 'I think they (male doctors) understand. The permutations and combinations of how you feel, like how can you explain this to almost anybody, like right now my insides are in a tenible mess and I don't know ifI ha~e something terminally wrong with me or whether I'm just absolutely exhausted and how much oflhat is due to the menopause thing, I don't know. I suspect it might be. You go to a gynaecologist, especi~ly a .male . . . gynaecologist , and try and explain all of this, you sound Just like an IdIOt ravmg on, so you tend to not even open up the conversation ..... Probably the best thing for me would be to go and have a six month cruise on the Carribean , no kidding. I do think that the menopause thing accentuates all of the problems and stresses that you are otherwise hav1ng in life, so the less stress you have, Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to thc standardised menopause package the less impact the menopause thing is going to have, but if you lead the sort of life that I do ... (Tess) The standardised menopause package works by simplifying and reducing menopause to a formulaic series of symptoms and signs which can be satisfactorily managed with hormone replacement therapy. This simplified package has been successful in maintaining the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency and its related system of management. However , women's experiences of menopause are far from simple. Women speak about confusion, complexities and messiness in relation to menopause . The ways in which women live menopause seems far removed from the orderly, logical, and rational processes of the clinic. The chaotic ways which many women experience menopause interrupts the standardised package of menopause . For these women, menopause is much more than hot flushes and night sweats for which a clever remedy is available. Tensions are apparent as women piece together their standardised clinic experiences in the bigger picture of their lives. It is in these tensions that doubts and uncertainties are shaped, and women begin to question the apparent incongruities. Menopause as a life passage The lack of consistency between women's lived experiences of menopause and the processes of the clinic are further exemplified in women's drawings ofmenopause.l!J The drawings women produced to represent menopause focused on three themes (Figures 3a, 3b, 3c: Women's graphic representations of menopause) . ~, At the close of intcrvicws with each of the women participating in Olis study, I gave each woman a blank C;lrd and coloured felt pens and asked them 10 draw whal came into their heads when they thought of \u00b7menop<lusc\u00b7. Women could choose to draw. write or verbally describe their thoughts. 185 Ch. 8: Tracing, dismptions to the standardised menopause package Figure 3a: Examples of women's graphic representations of menopause -Menopause as a life passage - .' . .' - ... .r r J,._\"-\" ..-_.r ! the standardised menopause package 186 Figure 3b: Examples of women's graphic representations of menopause -Menopause as symptoms and signs \" ! ~\"~ .. .. .,~\\. ..... ...' # dismplions to the standardised menopause package Figure 3c: Examples of women's graphic representations of menopause -Menopause as loss and ageing t... o:;,s 0\"> 188 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package The dominant theme in the women's drawings was menopause as a life transition . 84 Women who focussed on the theme of menopause as life passage typically drew trees or flowers, symbolic oflife growth, seasonal changes and ecological harmony. Phrases used by the women, such as \u00abautumn of my life\", \"three quarter point of my life\" or \u00abbeginning of the end\", all conjured up representations oflife transitions . Women drew their lives as a series of steps with menopause being just one phase of their overall lives. In addition to these symbolic representations, women discussed other significant life stages -their own puberty, child bearing, or their mother's menopause. These representations are indicative of the organisation of women's lives in terms of reproductive stages_ Women's understanding of menopause as a life passage at first contrasts the medicalised, standardised account of menopause as hormone deficiency . However, the notion of menopause as a life passage draws on a different type of medical is at ion. Women's lives are constructed in terms of reproduction and relationalIy , to hormone production -for example, puberty, childbearing and menopause . The experiences of puberty and childbearing are constructed as important and significant events for women. Menopause too becomes a life stage that many women want to be able to experience. Women on long term HRT expressed some ambivalence about the therapy as it denied them the experience of this phase of their life cycle. Many women, like Bella, on long term HRT following a total hysterectomy, wondered about the experience of menopause. For these women, HRT masks many of the signs of menopause and the usual signifiers marking the beginning of this period. !!1 Almost half lhe women responded b .... dmwing or wriLing about menopause as u life transition.

I want to know. For ten months now, I haven't had any hormones implanted. I don't know why I'd like to know. I can't explain why. Maybe I want to see what other women who haven't had a hysterectomy are going through. (Bella) The effects ofHRT in masking menopause was a common question posed by women during my observation of the public seminars conducted by clinic practitioners . Women expressed concern that if they took long tenn HR.T they would not know at what time they were actually going through menopause and when menopause had ceased. More often than not, the clinic practitioners responded that it was not important to know at what age you go through menopause and reinforced the preventive benefits of long tenn HRT. As one practitioner stated, \"You don't have to be menopausal to earn your HRT\". Other women on long term therapy pondered whether menopause was over for them and whether they needed to remain on HR.T. I'm not sure how you know when you've come to the end, if I'm through menopause . I seem to have stabilised. I wear the patch. rve had an implant over a period of time and now I put the patch on twice a week ... ! don't know ifT'm through or not because I don't know what's happening . I just have to go by Dr. M. (Kara) Rips (1993) distinguishes between menopause and midlife. She claims that 'menopause' has strong biological or physiological connotations while 'midlife' is suggestive of a life passage. I suggest that the boundaries between these terms are not so clear cut. As with the biolobT)'1 culture dichotomy, the rnidlifel menopause distinction is equally problematic. Women's lives are constructed in tenos of hormonal production , reproduction and loss of reproduction . These categories are intertwined with women's social responsibilities, work demands, and personal and financial commitment s. As women's accounts from this study showed, the women were unable to neatly designate their experiences as menopause related. Even if their experiences were deemed to be menopausa l, women found it difficult to delineate these into physical or emotional categories. Just as I have argued for the interrelation of the social and material, the biologica l and cultural are similarly intertwined . What is of interest here is the prevalence of the seamless, standardised menopause package in contrast to the messiness ofwome n's lived experiences and the ways women understand menopause . I am not suggesting that the standardised account is 190 Ch. 8: Tracing disruplions to the standardised menopause package medicalised in contrast to women's lived accounts as a non-medica lised life transition. Both accounts are constructed and both accounts draw on a system of medicalisation of hormone production. What I emphasise is that the official account has been increasingly stabilised as a result of standardisation practices and processes. Within the locale of the menopause clinic, the messiness of women's menopause is deleted as particular understandings of menopause win out over others. Women's accounts of menopause as a life passage paradoxically both resists and complies with the standardised account. It both challenges the hormone deficiency understanding of menopause and yet, in the organisation of women's lives in tenns of reproduction, to an extent complies with it. It is the ambiguities and contradictions which are of interest to me here, and the ways that understandings about menopause are not fixed but are constantly reworked and shaped. Claiming a space Women who attend menopause clinics, in particular those in large public hospitals, become very familiar with the physical and social architecture of the waiting room of the clinic. Waiting times may range from half an hour to 2 hours. As I described in Chapter 4, the waiting area is functional and fairly standard. Its purpose is a mundane one -to provide a space for women to wait prior to their consultations. However, the women who use this space renegotiate its purpose. Akin to women attending prenatal clinics for pregnancy checks, women in menopause clinics come to recognise the other women also waiting at each visit. The women use the waiting time as an opportunity to discuss their experiences and concerns with other women sharing similar problems . For many women, this is often their only opportunjty to talk about their experiences , in relative anonymity , with someone sharing a bank of similar experiences . Women not only share experiences and associated life events, but they also discuss their management strategies and use of different therapies . Consulting doctors and practitioners are compared and recommendations made as to who is a good listener or adviser. During my interviews with women attending clinics, the women made clear the claim they placed over the 191 Ch. 8: Tracing disruplions to the standardised menopause package waiting area. As I discussed previously. they talked about how the area could be improved with the addition of tea and coffee making facilities and more comfortable chairs which can be moved around. During their time there, the women reconstruct the otherwise sterile waiting area into a social space conducive to shared talk. They move the chairs around, initiate conversat ions and panake in personal and often revealing discussion . The space devoted to the mundane practical purpose of waiting is reworked by the women into a space for constructing knowledge about menopause . The waiting area I suggest becomes an important site for knowledge construction . Within this site, women, together with other women in similar circumstances, negotiate understandings about menopause. Juxtaposed against the standardised information provided from seminars. books and much of the promotional literature, is the information gained through collective participation . The waiting area provides a space for discussion and negotiation. Women's presence in the waiting area ofa menopause clinic could be read as an act of compliance and reinforcement of the standardised menopause package. However, this practice is simultaneou sly accommodating and resisting. Although women readily attend menopause clinics, examination of the ways women occupy this space indicates that they are not passive recipients but are actively construct ing and redefining this space for their own purpose. Women transform and rework this local space into a place where they can talk, share problems and process their understanding of menopause . Telling what's going on in your life Within the menopause clinic, it is not only women who negotiate the menopause package and translate it for their own use. The practices of some medicaJ practitioners also point to local interruptions to the standardised package. I have previously described how women are well rehearsed in the medical consultation process. Kevin, a clinic medical practitioner, exemplified how this standardised process can be disrupted . During initial consultations with women, Kevin makes a point of asking women to tell him about their lives, not their symptoms, but their lives in general. The women, well practised in translating their experiences into the 192 Ch. 8: Tracing dismptions to the standardised menopause package appropriate medical categories, usually respond by talking about their symptoms . Kevin's persistence is evident as he described how it often takes 20-30 minutes for women to stop talking about their symptoms and start talking about their lives. This practice disrupts the standard process of the medical consultation. The way the consultation proceeds is reworked . The consultation room is transformed from a place where women just recite their symptoms to a place where they are listened to, and their problems are positioned in context of their entangled lives. This reworking is not only a local translation of the place and the practices of the consulting room, but more importantly, this practice reworks power relations. I have argued how the processes which stabilise the standardised menopause package generate particular power relations which reinforce this package. Local disruptions to these processes work to renegotiate power relations, enabling women to actively participate in the management of their menopause. These interruptions to the standardised practices of the menopause clinic act as possible points of destabilisation, as different groups renegotiate the network in attempting to meet their particular needs. Contradicting HRT r have argued that fundamental to the working of the menopause clinic is the construction of menopause as a problem of hormone deficiency and HRT as the solution. Women's signs and experiences are made into symptoms ofa hormone deficiency disease. These symptoms are standardised and the ways they are managed and treated prescribed . Practitioners adopt a standardised tool kit from which they can draw out the relevant tool to fix the problems of menopause . These processes of standardisation ensure particular lines of authority and power. However , the local practices of women and practitioners alike create ruptures in the consolidation of the standardised menopause package. Women's use of alternative therapies, their challenging ofhonnone level testing, their 'lack of compliance' with regard to HRT and the concern of general practitioners in prescribing long tenn use ofHRT each disrupts, on a local level, the standardisation of the menopause package. These disruptions work on a multiplicit y of levels. They offer a difft:rent st:L Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopau se package in the decision making process in the management of menopau se. In so doing, professional authority is challenged and power relations are renegotiated . \"It's fake oestrogen going into your body\" ]93 It is understandable that women have serious concerns about the long term effects of fffi..T. Many of the women currently going through menopause are of the same generation of women who lived through the controversies surrou~ding the oral contraceptive pill, thalidomide, DES and other hormonal drugs. These 'clever' drugs of the 60s and 70s resulted in dire consequences with many women subject to disastrous outcomes . These grave concerns and the desire for more 'natural' therapies leads many women attending menopause clinics to seek alternative management of their problems. Such alternative strategies commonly include naturopathy. meditation, massage and chiropractic. These women have either used these forms of alternative management alone or in conjunction with more traditional allopathic hormonal therapy for the management of their menopausal complaints . The women's perception of these alternative fonus of therapy as 'natural' is in contrast with their notions ofHRT as hormonal drug replacement. This, together with the women's use ofaltemative forms of management, presents discord and conflict in the interactions of the clinic. I am seeing a naturopath as well. To be totally honest, after saying all those good things (about the hormone patches) I've found some of the natural things to be more helpful. I'm still not keen on staying on these patches~ the jaclthat if'S a dru~ and if .... -jake oestrogen going ifllo your body. I've been trying the two together and it seems to be helping a lot more and I'm hoping to slowly wean off the patches if I can. The naturopath has put me onto dong kai capsules mainly for hormonal replacement. Just because ofa couple of the symptoms that I've had~ skin break out~ that's probably the other negative side I've had from the clinic. As much as I would recommend them (the clinic practitioners) , as soon as you mention (to them) that you're seeing a naturopath , you sort of feel that they think they can't help you, because a couple of things one has said the other one has conflicted . When I said about my skin breaking out, it was denied that it had to do with the patches, J think I've proved that it is, and the weight gain as well. I'm hoping one can support the other. Eventual1y, my hope is to get off the patches altogether and stick to the natural and take the natural on its own. 1ft find that doesn't work then I'll have to find a happy balance. (Tania) t9. Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package Here Tania notes the contradictions in the management of her complaints and speaks of the conflicting views and actions of her two practitioners. Tania, like many women who combine HRT with alternative therapies, is reworking the standardised menopause package. The package is being remade locally as alternative therapies are inserted into the network, and HR.T is being reconfigured with other forms of therapy, Alternative therapies, like phytoestrogens and other naturopathic treatments , are introduced into the clinic's network of relations. Women, like Tania, combine and reconfigure the ways these therapies get used. Tania supplements her HRT dosage with alternative treatments with the aim of weaning herself off HRT altogether. Tania is taking charge of the management of her menopaus e, and, in so doing, is reworking the power relations she shares with both her medical practitioner and alternative therapist. The practice of seeking alternative therapies for the management of menopause is, like many of the other practices described, both compliant and resistant. As I go on to discuss later in this chapter, the promotion of naturopathic products fits neatly in the hormone deficiency model. Use of products, such as phytoestrogens (plant oestrogens), still serve to replace deficient hormones, only this time involving the use of alternative hormonal substances. In addition, naturopathy and other such practices for the management of menopause do not necessarily conflict with the operation of the menopause clinic, with many clinic practitioners referring women to naturopaths for alternative therapy. In this way the use of alternative management practices complies with the stabilisation processes of the menopause clinic. However , as exemplified by Tania's comments, these alternative avenues require redirection of the flow of decisions arising from the standardised clinic practices and, in so doing, are potential sources of tension and conflict. This redirection and questioning of the standardised practices results in certain disruptions. It is these disruptions that work to destabilise the operation and standardisation of the menopause clinic. 195 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package \"I know when 1 need hormones\" I have previously described the practice of blood honnone testing to either diagnose menopause, or to monitor hormone levels in women with HRT implants. This practice works to transform a woman~s menopause into a series of tangible test measurements; women's menopausal experience are translated into whether their hormone levels need topping up. These diagnostic tests, with their claim of scientific validity and legitimacy, work together with the other social-material technologies of the clinic to reinforce the package of menopause as hormone deficiency. However, some women challenge the validity of these test results and question the interpretations and decisions based on these results. Many women, including Lorna quoted below, challenge discordant hormone levels with their claim that they can read their body's hormone levels. Lorna spoke about her ex.perience of having had her blood hormone levels tested by her local general practitioner to diagnose whether or not she was menopausal. I had the tests done to see if J was menopausal and the hormone levels were normal. With my second child I went and had a pregnancy test and it came back negative and I said to my doctor that I am pregnant, I don't care what the test said, I'm pregnant. He said yes I think you are too, and 1 was of course. 1 knew, I already had one and I knew I was. T (menopause clinic practitioner) was saying that a lot of these tests -it's on a given day, how much can you rely on them: How does that explain when somebody has had a period every 28 days and suddenly it's 45 days and you might bleed for 2 weeks and it might start again J days later. It's not normal, so how much do you rely on the tests? (Lorna) Some women claimed to be able to read when their body was telling them that their hormone levels were too low or high but, like Maria quoted below, felt unable to contradict their doctors or the authority of the hormone test results. It's hard to explain because 1 can feel it. My kidney doesn't work properly .. I don't understand that medical thing. I know it's like before. I know when I need hormones -the same signs .... But I don't want to tell this to the doctor when I think I need hormones. Because obviously she's right; she knows what she's doing; she does the blood tests and she knows. (Maria) '96 Ch. 8: Tracing disruPlions to the standardised menopause package Contradictions and tensions arise as the standardised technologies are brought into question and cha11enged. In each rendering, hormone deficiency is constructed differently . With the blood hormone tests, hormone deficiency is read as a tangible hormone ratio standardised to a given set of measurements . For women, hormone deficiency is also rendered in terms ofa scale, this time a 'feeling' scale. Although women are still using the same hormone deficiency framework to read their own bodies, the translation afhannone deficiency between test measurements and women's feelings is not necessarily a smooth one. In this way, women present alternative and often contradictory interpretations to that of the standardised tests. Thus, what was otherwise a smooth path of decision making becomes riddled with inconsistencies . Not complying with regard to HRT Vital to the stabilisation of the menopause package in the menopause clinic is the use of HRT. The notion of menopause as hormone deficiency is co-constituted with the use of hormone replacement as the solution to this deficiency problem. HR.T is used either on a short term basis (less than 5 years) for treatment of acute symptoms of menopause. or long term (10 years or moreu) for the prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease. A major concern in the medical literature in the last few years has been 'he 'lack of compliance' of women taking HRT, particularly HRT (Coope & Marsh, & I-Iubennan, 1990; Wren & Brown, 1991). Recent studies indicate that the current usage rate of HR T amongst peri menopausal women in the general Australian community is 14-21% (Shelley. Smith. Dudley & Dennerstein , 1995~ MacLennan , II' The length of time a woman should remain on therapy to benefit from the prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease has been a source of uncertainty in the medical literature . Most authors suggest that the grc<ltest benefit oceurs if therapy is administered for 10-.15 years or longer (Wren. 11)1)1. Grady. Cummings. ei al.. 1992). As there h::we been very few studies on the long term use of combined oestrogen and progesterone therapy. little infonnation is available as to the side c[Tects associated with prolonged use of the combined honnone therapy. Sec Grady. Rubin. et al.. (I t)92) for a review of the English language medica! literature on the effects of hormone therapy since 1970. 197 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions 10 the standardised menopause package MacLennan & Wilson, 1993).86 However. current usage rate afHRT in menopause clinics is much higher. This study found that 71% of women interviewed were currently using HRT. This figure is validated by an earlier Australian study which showed that of 79 women attending a Sydney menopause clinic, 73% were currently usingHRT (Wren & Brown, 1991). The concerns voiced in the medical literature centre around the number of women who commence hormonal therapy and then cease taking it after what the medical community considers to be a short length oftime. Although there is some variation in figures, most studies indicate that many women in the general community cease to take HRT after a few months of commencing treatment. The Massachusetts Women's Health Survey of2500 women showed that 20% of women prescribed HRT stopped taking the drug after 9 months. Of greater interest, 20%-30% of the 2500 women surveyed never had their prescriptions filled because they were either not convinced of the benefits of the therapy or were concerned about the risks associated wilh the therapy (Ravnikar, 1987). The Melbourne Women's Midlife Health Project involving 2000 Australian women indicates that 50% of women stop taking HRT after 12 months (Shelley, et aI., 1995). Australian studies show that of 79 women attending menopause clinics, 27% had ceased therapy after 12 months (Wren & Brown, 1991). US studies indicate that of 100 women attending menopause clinics, 64% had taken oestrogen at some stage in the past but had discontinued therapy because of concerns with HR T and increased cancer risks, and side effects which they had not been told about by their physicians (Rebar, Thomas, Gass, & Liu, 1990). A recent European study states that of 331 women attending a menopause clinic, 37% had either discontinued or never commenced the hormone therapy prescribedH7: of those women who stopped therapy. the majority ceased ~h Recent studies or European peri mcnoJXLusal women show a wide variation in the current usage rate or HRT.

Only 27 (less than 10%) of the initial 331 women surveyed remained on HRT for 5 years or more (Cano, 1995). 19R The discourse evident in this literature constructs women as \"at risk\" of chronic diseases such as osteoporosis and heart disease, and in logical steps, constructs HRT and the medical community as the solution. To quote a well known medical practitioner in the menopause field, ~<HR Twill aHow us to practise preventive medicine as well as improving the quality oflife for a large number of post\u00ad menopausal women\" (Wren & Brown, 1991, p.B). HRT and medical practitioners are thus constructed as saving women from possible risks of disease, and women ceasing to take HR T are constructed as non compliant. The reasons 'non-complian t' women give for ceasing therapy vary. However , the main reasons include, first, side effects, such as bleeding, depression, weight gain and breast soreness, second, concern about long tenn effects, in particular the likelihood of cancer, third, no further need for therapy, fourth, the high cost of therapy, and finally, dissuasion by the media (Wren & Brown, 1991; Coope & Marsh, 1992; MacLennan , et aI., 1993; Shelley, et a1,. 1995; Rebar, et aI., 1990; Cano, 1995). Women in this study also reported a similar range of reasons as to why they stopped honnone therapy. For women like Kay, taking HRT has resulted in serious side effects which have required further investigations and therapy. That ultrasound is a result of my being on HRT. T was thinking about it this morning and 1 don't like that side. The two side effects rm having are that I have a lot of trouble with my breasts and I'm going for a mammogram tomorrow and I have a lot of pelvic pain (being investigated using ultrasound). J don't like having to go through this. I'm not happy about having to have a mammogram tomorrow although I realise it's in my best interest to do so. You have to weigh it up once again. T would have been happy ifT could have remained on natural therapy and not having to go through these tests. (Kay) The side effects following hormone therapy greatly influence women's decision to cease therapy. Women's pelvic pain and breast soreness are transfonned into sites of material resistance . Many women's bodies do not comply physiologically to HRT resulting in their decision to discontinue taking HRT. The high financial cost of 199 Ch. &: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package managing menopause and taking HRT becomes another form of material resistance. Many women expressed concern about the high cost ofHRT, in addition to the expense of monitoring tests such as bone densitometry, for which there is only limited financial rebate.ss These fonns of material resistance add to the ruptures and destabilising effects of the standardised menopause package. Although it is menopausal women who are constructed as nan compliant in terms of HR.T, further probing of the literature suggests that medical prescribers ofHRT are also concerned about its effects. Most medical practitioners show little concern regarding the short term use (less than 5 years) ofHRT for the alleviation of menopausal complaints (Bryce & Lilford, 1990; Nonnan & Studd, 1994). However , the long tenn use ofHRT for preventive reasons provokes considerable uncertainty and concern among general practitioners who prescribe HR.T. In a recent study of 310 general practitioners in UK. only 29% were prepared to prescribe HR.T for longer than 5 years (Bryce & Lilford, 1990). Other studies involving larger groups of general practitioners and specialist consultants also conclude that many practitioners have doubts about the long tenn prescribing ofliRT (Norman & Studd, 1994; Wilkes & Meade, 1991). The reasons given by the medical practitioners for their disquiet over the long term use ofHRT are: concern over the long tenn effects of therapy with insufficient data available about these effects, financial cost of therapy. poor patient compliance, time required to supervise treatment and necessary monitoring and a <'strong general concern about a pharmacological approach to what is seen as a natural process in humans\" (Bryce & Lilford, 1990, p. 60). Some menopaus e clinic practitioners also expressed concern over the long term use of HRT. Elaine, a gynaecologist working in a public menopause clinic, remarked on her ~ DUring thc period or the flcldwork (1994). women were charged between SA 75-SA 110 for a bone densilOlllctl!

Thc cost of ffRT is now subsidised by the National Health Scheme. with oral preparations and transdermal p.1tches costing women between SA 13-$A25 depending on the dosage of the preparation . The cost of implants however remains high. Many women attending publie menopause clinics claim that their primary reason for returning to these clinics is to obtain hospital subsidies for their implants. which they othemisc could not alford. Ch. 8; Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause packagc practice of not promoting HRT and adopting what she considered to be a less medical approach to menopause . 2()() I don't believe menopause needs treating because HR.T is there. My perception is that I have less ofa medical approach to the problem, I shouldn't use the word \u00b7problem', less of a medical approach to the situation than other people do. I certainly don't promote HRT. I seem to spend more time taking people off it than putting them on it. It's an interesting reflection on where the clinic's gone. We often get people in because they're having problems with their HRT and I seem to stop it more often than I start it. I see women in midlife as needing infonnation and education primarily, perhaps medical management of some problems , but usually not. That's where I start. (Elaine, menopause clinic practitioner) Although Elaine thought that her approach was perhaps different to some of her medical colleagues, she was finn in her resolve that her primary role was to help women make an informed decision rather than seeing herself essentially as a medical prescriber ofHRT. Recent medical articles entitled Can we impruve cumpliance with long-term HRT? (Ccope & Marsh, 1992) and Compliance with hormonal replacement therapy (Wren & Brown, 1991), clearly construct menopausal women as non compliant rather than as serious resistors with regard to HRT. Many of these articles conclude with strategies which will encourage women to remain on long term HRT. Such strategies include greater provision of information about menopause to medical practitioners, more counselling on the part of medical practitioners to alleviate women's fears, reassurance to women and constant monitoring (Wren & Brown, 1991), as well as giving women advice \"in a friendly, accessible way\" (Coope & Marsh, 1992, p.l 57). Of particular interest, these latter authors propose setting up a specialised menopause clinic within a general practice as a means of improving women's compliance (Coope & Marsh, 1992). Their experience indicates that the employment of this strategy improved the rate of compliance in women remaining on HR T. Recall the provision of education seminars directed to general practitioners by menopause clinic practitioners discussed earlier. These infonnation seminars are centred around providing general practitioners with the latest information about the appropriate use of HR T for both treatment of acute symptoms of menopause and its preventive Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to thc standardised menopause package benefits. These seminars can be read as not only providing infonnation to general practitioners , but also offering reassurance and allaying the fears of those general practitioners concerned about the use ofHRT. This use Qf general practitioner education serves a double purpose~ by ensuring general practitioner compliance in prescribing HRT, it also works to increase women's compliance in actually taking HRT. 20] This medical literature is interesting in its construction of menopausal women as non compliant . Without addressing the legitimacy and seriousness of women's choice to stop HRT. strategies are proposed to alleviate women's concerns and fears. HR.T and the medical community are constructed as saving women from the risks of \"asympto matic and silently prOb'fessive diseases\" (Co ope & Marsh, 1992, p.157) and women are deemed to be irresponsible if they choose not to take up this option. Increasingly, the focus has shifted to women being responsible for the prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease. This reading of women as non compliant fails to acknowledge that women's decision making is operating in a different kind of system to that used by the HRT prescribers. In considering whether to take or remain on BRT, women actively work multiple rationalities and considerations in their decision making process. Similarly. those practitioners who choose not to prescribe long term HRT disrupt the flow in the standardised decision making process. In contrast. for those practitioners for whom the prescription of long term HRT is not problematic, decision making is narrowly channelled, resulting in very directed and specific paths of action. In working multiple rationalities. the power relations of the standardised menopau se package are reshaped. In disrupting the prescribing and therapeutic practices . the lines of authority are challenged and alternatives made possible. It is intriguing that despite women's concerns about the long tenn effects ofHRT being shared by many medical practitioners , it is only menopausal women who are constructed as non compliant. General practitioners choosing not to prescribe HRT for long term use are not constructed as non compliant, but rather as lacking adequate information about the benefits ofHRT (Bryce & Lilford, 1990). Although the data presented on refusal to prescribe HRT is based on community practitioners rather than those in menopause clinics, such ambiguities in practices seep into the 202 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package menopause clinic arena, evidenced by Elaine's comments. Women in this study expressed grave concerns about the long term effects ofHRT and cite this and other reasons for ceasing therapy. These concerns and their \"failure to comply\" with regard to HRT undennines the stability of the existing network of relations within the menopause clinic. Although the use ofHRT is a necessary and vital component in the current working of the clime. the ambiguities which I have highlighted alert us to other possibilities. For example, Elaine's comments provide us with a glimpse of such alternatives. Elaine sees her role primarily in terms ofinfonning and educating menopausal women about their condition, thus enabling them to become managers of their menopause. With this type of approach, medical management and HR.T assume a peripheral role, displaced from its central position by information provision on menopause and other ways of managing menopausal complaints . Disruptions to the clinic's network of relations can be enabling processes, on more than just the local level. Power relations are translated and in some cases reversed, as women opt not to take HRT despite their physicians' advice, and general practitioners refuse to prescribe long term HRT, despite its claimed benefits. Such moves have potentially far reaching ramifications in terms of health care provision and policy.39 The use ofHRT as primary intervention in the management of menopause is key to the stabilisation of the menopause clinic. Although practices such as questioning hormone level testing and the use of alternative therapies contribute to the stabilisation of the clinic in one sense, they also disrupt the standardised processes which operate to maintain the clinic. Women choosing to stop honnonal treatment, together with general practitioners ' refusal to prescribe long term I-IRT, lead to ambiguities and concerns over the use ofHRT. These practices are not intended to disrupt and resist the running of menopause clinics. However. 1 arb'1le that being attentive to these everyday practices denotes the ways the standardised menopause package is negotiated at the local level. These local practices act as sites of social and material resistance to the standardisation and stabilisation of the menopause 1<') The final chapter is dcvoted to c:\",:ploring the wider implications and ramificat ions of these moves in temlS of menopausal management and health policy. 2()~ Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package package. Power relations generated from these practices are transformed and lines of authority undermined, leading to new kinds of relations. Linking marginal collectives Many groups, including naturopaths and psychologists, occupy the margins of the menopause clinic arena. These groups participate in the interactions of the clinic but often only in a peripheral way. Such groups do not share the standardised practices and technologies of the menopause clinic. nor are their approaches and understanding of menopause necessarily those of hormone deficiency. However , their interactions within the clinic's orderings are important in rughlighting both alternative ways of managing menopause and other understandings of this phenomenon . The strategies and practices employed by these different groups both reshape the current configuration of the menopause package and put into question the professional autonomy granted to particular groups within the network. In the following section, I focus on the manoeuvres of two groups, namely naturopaths and psychologists, and examine their operation and effects on the clinic network. Naturopaths The use of alternative therapies has increased considerably over the last decade. British surveys conducted between 1984 and 1987 suggest that 34% of the population had tried an alternative therapy (Coward, 1989, p.3). Surveys conducted in Australia claim that 22% of 1202 respondents had used the services of an alternative therapist (Weisner, 1989, p.23). Naturopaths are amongst a large group of alternative practitioners to whom women turn to seek help for managing their menopause . I have chosen to discuss naturopath y more specifically as many women in this study commonly sought out this practice amongst other potential alternative practices. Approximately two thirds of women participating in this study had tried or were currently using some form of alternative therapy (most commonly naturopathy) either on its own or in combination with HRT. Earlier, I discussed the reasons women sought alternative therapies -concern about long term effects of HR T and a desire to use a more \"natural\" therapy. Women attending menopause clinics often 20\"' Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package asked to be referred to a naturopath, or sought naturopathic remedies independently of the clinic?) Naturopathy covers a wide range of therapies inc!uding nutritional , lifestyle and herbal remedies. Naturopathy is well established and its application is being used increasingly in many different kinds of disorders. Ideologicall y, naturopathy operates on the basis of restoring balance between mind and body, focussing initially on restoring internal equilibrium using diet and nutrition (Weisner, 1989, pp. 87-91). Naturopathy , in the management of menopause, uses a variety of vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, herbs and phytoestrogens (Cabot, 1991; Nissim, 1986). Phytoestrogens have been increasingly promoted as a therapeutic means to replace deficient hormones and relieve menopausal problems. Phytoestrogens are plant oestrogens found in many different herbs and plant foods, including soy products, rice, oats, linseed, liquorice, alfalfa and sage (Cabot, 1991; Nissim, 1986) Although these phytoestrogens contain far less oestrogen concentrations than is found in HRT, they have none of the associated risks and side effects ofHRT (Farrell & Westmore, 1993). The aim in using these substances is to reduce and manage menopausal symptoms by replacing depleted hormone s or by stimulating the production of the body's own hormones . Naturopathy and its associated use of phytoestrogens occupies a curious position in the menopause clinic's network of relations. The use ofphytoestrogens could be read as a simple translation device for HRT. In other words, HRT as a solution to the problem of menopause is being substituted with alternative hormonal replacements or stimulants. This strategy is currently in operation . Several Australian trials are under way to test the effects ofphytoestrogens on menopausal symptoms in women. A number of research groups in Sydney and Melbourne menopause clinics are presently running controlled clinical trials to evaluate the effects of 'XI Although a large number orwomcn had tried alternative therapies, most only used this type of therapy for a short period of time before stopping. Reasons women gave for stopping these alternative them pies were that the therapy did not alleviate their symptoms. or alleviated them initiall~ ' butlhcn stopped working: these therapies took too long to work: the high cost or altcmmivc therapies: the necessity to take many tablets: and also the women '5 desire for a more controlled procedure rather than having to try many different strategies in a seemingly haphazard wa.v. Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package phytoestrogens, such as soya compounds and red clover extracts, on menopausal complaints (Smith, 1995). 205 Although such trials may confirm the role of phytoestrogens as a potential substitute for HR T, this translation is not so simple or straightforward. Phytoestrogens belong to a set of orderings different from HRT. The network from which phytoestrogens stems operates within a different philosophical base to that ofHRT -an approach based on restoring balance to the mind-body equilibrium, as disthict from a fonn of management centred on replacing deficient honnones. Furthermore , the use ofHR.T far supersedes alternative therapies in the management of menopause and for most practitioners the first line therapy remains HR.T. Although most clinic practitioners were quick to discuss the benefits of some naturopathic remedies, this line of treatment still remains an \"alternative to HR.T\". Tania's quote, earlier in this chapter, showed that although clinic practitioners may acknowledge the work ofnaturopaths, the management decisions of the two groups are not necessarily complementary. and in her case, were contradictory and conflicting. Like many of the practices already discussed , naturopathic practices both agree with the menopause as honnone deficiency package and yet oppose it. Naturopaths are not physically located in any of the clinics, although most clinic practitioners if requested to do so, will refer women to naturopaths. Naturopaths are thus positioned within the menopause clinic network, albeit occupying a marginal position. The promotion and use of alternative sources of hormones and hormonal stimulants works to reinforce and stabilise the particular understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency . However, there is more than this at work. Although tenuously complicit to the homlOne deficiency model ofrnenopause, naturopaths present as potential competitors in the struggle for professional authority within the menopause arena. J have shown how women are resisting the authority of the medical practitioners as they question test results, fail to comply with the therapies prescribed to them by their physicians , seek alternative therapeutic sources and negotiate strategies in managing their menopause . Many authors have pointed to the extraordinary proliferation of alternative therapies (Coward , 1989; Crawford. 1980; Weisner, 1989). Tempted by the alluring messages of these various therapies toward 206 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions 10 the standardised menopause package a more caring, integrated and natural form of management, an increasing number of people are turning away from orthodox medicine. As Coward notes, the perception of alternative therapies as 'fringe' groups is being replaced by an increasing respectability, and with this, a push for self regulation, professiona l registration and authorisation of these groups (Coward, 1989). Issues of professional authority arise as clinic practitioners and alternative therapists come together in the management of menopause . I proceed to explore these issues in more detail, linking in similar problems faced by psychologists within the menopause arena. Psychologists Those clinics adopting an interdisciplinary team approach often employed the services of a psychologist in addition to medical practitioners.91 Analogous to the naturopaths, psychologists operate within a different ideological and philosophical base to that of medical practitioners . Within the menopause clinic, psychologists manage women' s emotional well being, address their self esteem and sense of self during menopause . Psychologists occupy a physical space in the menopause clinic and women are referred to them if considered to have problems which would benefit from psychological management.92 Women's psychological problems are managed either by individual consultation or women may choose to attend a group session with other menopausal women or with their partners. The inclusion of psychologists as part of the menopause clinic network is based on an increasing awareness of the interrelation of both physical and psychological problems during menopause . It is the same awareness shared by women about the complex messiness and interconnectedness of their menopause . Unlike naturopaths , psychologists are ')1 .,/5 of the clinics in this sludy cmployed a psychologist as pan of their tcarn.

They are recognised by many medical practitioners as having an important part to play in the overa11 management of women's menopausal problems and they form part oft.he interdisciplinarity of the menopause clinic, Various psychological approaches are available to psychologists and different management practices are used in different clinics by different practitioners. However, what these approaches share is an attempt to look holistically at a woman's life -her sense of self, past problems, current responsibilities and difficulties, and the resources available to her to deal with these difficulties . A woman' 5 mental well being during menopause is thought to play an important part in her overall management of her menopause. Psychologists support women in acknowledging and addressing stressful and difficult aspects of their lives which impinge on their menopausal experiences. Teresa, a clinic psychologist, sees her work as making links between the psychological and the somatic in terms of menopausal management and furthermore, to make the clinic's medical practitioners aware of these connections . Despite attempts by psychologists to make their fellow clinic practitioners aware of these connections , the everyday practices of the clinic indicate that managing a woman's emotional well being is considered to be the domain of the clinic psychologist . The construction of a mind-body division becomes apparent in managing women's menopausal problems. Interaction s between psychologists and medical clinic practitioners pose particular difficulties as women's problems are categorised as either somatic or psychologicaL As Teresa claimed, The links between the somatic and psychological are often not made by doctors. Women may be referred to me without knowing why. The links between a woman's emotional factors and her physical problems are often not made for women by the doctors. The clinic doesn't help warneD say what they want; it doesn't give women a choice in how they want their menopause to be managed. (Teresa, clinic psychologist93) ')1 Permission was not granted to tape the interview :md therefore interview tr:mscript not available . Quote taken rrom field nOles. 208 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package A woman's emotional problems becomes the domain of the clinic psychologist, just as her uterus and ovaries are made the province of the gynaecologist and her honnonal balance the territory of the endocrinologist. This separation of body parts into specialties (and mind and body in the case of the psychologists) contradicts the holistic approach to the psychological management of menopause . Attempts at interdiscipiinarity between different professional groups within the menopause clinic becomes merely a physical convenience rather than one of positive interactions . The position of psychologists is problematic within the clinic network. The use of HRT remains the primary mode of management, thus placing the use of counselling and psychological support on the periphery. Teresa commented on the disjointed forms of management in the clinic: Doctors feel pressured in some cases where hormonal therapy doesn't work. For women who are in adverse circumstances, or women who are difficult and demanding , there is often pressure on doctors to 'do something'. If doctors can't, they often feel frustrated and pass the woman, or the problem, on to the psychologist. (Teresa, clinic psychologist94) This suggests, as with naturopathy , that alternative therapies are only considered if the conventional forms of therapy fail. This again becomes a case of \u00abaltemative to HRT\", rather than as a first line approach . Menopause as hormone deficiency is still primary, and only when this does not produce successful outcomes are alternatives considered This passing on of women to psychologists only wheTI HRT has failed is interesting in light of the large numbers of women interviewed who talked about the high level of reassurance and support they received from being able to talk to other women about their experiences .95 Most women found this source of support to be ').1 Permission was not granted to tape the interview and therefore inlerview transcript not available.

Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package highly beneficial, enabling them to better cope with the difficulties they were expenencmg . 209 As with naturopathy, the practices and approaches of psychologists are both allied to and oppose the standardised menopause package. Psychologists, in their physical positioning within the clinic, have appropriated a place in the clinic's network of relations. The inclusion of psychologists in this network enables and maintains the interdisciplinary nature of the menopause clinic. However, examination of the everyday interactions between psychologists and clinic practitioners suggests some friction. Psychologist s, in working the links between the somatic and the psychological, pose a challenge to the menopause as hormone deficiency package. These local practices are a potential source of destabilisation in the smooth running of the menopause clinic network. On a wider scale, the presence of the psychologist s also threaten the existing power relations within the clinic network. The professional autonomy of the medical practitioners is no longer taken for granted as the struggle for authority is played out. Competing/complementary professions Much scholarly space has been devoted to the study of professions , in particular the medical profession, widely considered as an archetype.% It is not my aim to consider the sociology of professions in detail here but rather to reflect on some of this literature in considering the actions and outcomes of the different professiona l groups of the menopause clinic in their attempts to stabilise their respective positions . I raise three points. First, I examine the struggle for legitimation of many alternative practitioners, and the positioning of this struggle within the menopause clinic. Second, I explore the differences between interdisciplinarity and complementarit y between the professions in the provision of menopau sal 'It> I have greatly benefited from my reading ofthc following in regard to the study of professions: Abbott (1988), Arncv (1982). Frcidson (1987) and Waddell & Peterscn (1994). Particul~rly useful in addressing the role of medical professions in Australia are Daniel (1990). Petersen ([99..\\.) and Willis (1989). 210 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package management in the menopause clinic. Finally. I introduce a point which 1 take up in more detail in the next chapter, namely the interactions between general practitioners and specialist clinic practitioners with regard to the most appropriate domain for management of menopause . AJternative practitioners have struggled, and continue to struggle, for legitimation of their practices. Standardisation procedures, self regulation and licensing are currently being introduced (Lupton, 1994; Weisner, 1989; Willis, 1989). Orthodox medicine has gained its legitimacy under the rubric of its scientific basis and its claims of abstract, complex and specialised knowledge. The system of professions and structural base which exists in controlling medical skills and knowledge has led to the rise of medical dominance in our society (Abbott, 1988). Alternative practitioners have attempted to acquire a similar credential base in their attempts to regulate themselves, and at the same time, promote various aspects of their professionalism . The menopause clinic, with its established medical base, is already conferred a sense of professional legitimacy . Alternative practices, such as naturopathy, can cash in on this established legitimacy by consolidating their position within the menopause clinic network. By establishing a strong web of relations with the other collectives of the network, alternative practitioners can strengthen not only their position within the local network, but confirm their professional legitimacy and authority on a global level. Ironically, critics have suggested that acquisition of this professional status by altemative practitioners will move these groups closer ideologically to the prevailing doctor-patient model of biomedicine and thus compromise the holistic and caring model which has attracted so many their followers (Lupton, 1994, p.127). Despite this paradox, alternative practitioners continue to build their professional legitimacy. and the menopause clinic provides a convenient and apt site for this work. Within the menopause clinic, women select practitioners, such as naturopaths and psychologists, based on the different kinds of approaches these groups offer. As I have already outlined, these groups operate from a different ideological and philosophical base than many of the medical clinic practitioners . Women perceive their menopause as complex and intertwined and seek management strategies which 211 Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standar\u00a34scd menopause package complement their use ofHRT with alternative therapies and practices. As Tania commented regarding her use of HR T in combination with naturopathic remedies, \"I'm hoping one can support the other ... I'll have to find a happy balance\". Tania, like many menopausal women, is seeking management strategies which complement each other. HRT, alternative therapies, counselling, support from friends and family are al\\ strategies women employ in balance with one another to provide a holistic management approach. What women seek is complementary management of their menopause. However, what menopause clinics provide is a convenient base for different disciplinary strategies. Menopause clinics bring together different professiona l groups in one location and construct a set of relations between these various collectives. However, as I have shown, women's management within the clinic becomes divided into mind-body divisions, or is fragmented into a series of organ parts which are managed by different specialist practitioners using specialist approaches. The resulting management is neither complementary nor holistic. but is segmented. Within this melange, HRT and the standardised menopause package dominate and remain the first line approach. Other practices are positioned as secondary to this standardised approach. Menopause clinics stemmed from endocrine clinics. As an offshoot of this endocrine model, the notion of menopause as honnone deficiency and its associated use ofHRT was, and remains} primary in menopausal management. Menopausal management in clinics is fragmented with the marbrinal position of alternative practitioners being reinforced. A1though the connections are being established with alternative practitioner groups, the notion of complementary menopausa l management remains a semblance. Within the menopause clinic network, the struggle for professional authority within the medical profession itselfis also evident. I have described the tenuous relationship between general practitioners and menopause climc practitioners.97 Genera] practitioners are constructed as allies and necessary elements within the clinic network.

Underlying these issues of professional authority is the question as to whether general practice or the specialist menopause clinic is the most appropriate domain for the management of menopause, taking into consideration the existing structural and systemic limitation s of the Australian medical system ofeare. This question raises many interesting and important considerat ions which I take up in the next chapter. The local struggles for professional authority and legitimacy have consequences both within the specific locale of the menopause c1iruc and on a wider sca1e. These professional conflicts maintain the state afflux of the clinic network. The dominance of the standardised menopause package is brought to question. The outcomes of these local struggles can potentially provide greater options for women seeking help during menopause. As the standardised package is displaced, new elements and practices are inserted and possible changes result. Women are seeking complementary approaches in their menopausaJ management. The struggles for professional authority have the potential of providing a system closer to that which women seem to be seeking. These local practices also have ramifications on a wider level. Alternative practitioners are actively seeking professional legitimacy and the menopause clinic provides yet another site from which this work can be based. As different practices and management philosophies are introduced both locally and globally, the standardi sed practices and ideologies of orthodox medicine are questioned and subject to destabilisation . As local practices are reworked and reshaped, points of destabilisation develop with potential effects at both local and macro levels. Summary The menopause clinic, despite its appearance of stability, is in flux. Practices which act to stabilise the intricate network of relations of the clinic are counterbalanced by practices which challenge these stabilisatio n processes . The primary aim of these 2D Ch. 8: Tracing disruptions to the standardised menopause package counteracting practices is not necessarily to destabilise the menopause clinic. However, the local actions and interrelations of the clinic work to question, challenge and disrupt the standardised. flow of actions anc~ decision making processes currently in operation. \"What we thought had direction -shakes and quivers.\"(Law & Mol, 1995, p.275). Boundary objects similarly shake and quiver. The employment ofthe conceptual tool of boundary objects with which to analyse the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency continues to be useful here. As the different techno social collectives of the clinic jostle one another, the wide margin of negotiation of this boundary object becomes visible. Women's alternative readings of their hormone levels, the insertion of new elements and the reworking of existing practices all reshape the standardised menopause package. Being attentive to the local practices and connections of the clinic network makes apparent this reworking and negotiating. These local practices do not specifically aim to dismantle the menopause clinic. In many ways these practices comply with the construction and stabilisation of the clinic's network of relations. However, simultaneous to their compliance, these practices are also resisting the package of menopause as hormone deficiency. Practices have multiple rationalities. What appears as compliance may also be resistance . As long as these interrelations between the various technosocial col1ectives exist, new possibilities remain. It is through these different practices that we can catch glimpses of other ways of understanding menopause. Points of leverage are identified which can be worked and used as points of action. J argue that the mundane and seemingly insignificant local practices have impact. Women's questioning of hormone levels, their insistence on seeing their menopause as a complex integration of the physical and emotional, and their <non compliance' are all local practices, as is the refusal of general practitioners to prescribe long term HRT. Similarly the manoeuvres and negotiations ofaltemative practitioners work locally. However , these local effects also have wider implications . Local struggles for professional authority and legitimacy have global ramifications, as does the social and material resistance of women and general practitioners . In this way, challenges are made and possible changes emerge. 214 Ch. 9: Conclusion Chapter 9 -Conclusion Introduction This has been a story about women, practitioners, technologies, practices and a particular notion of menopause which enable them to all come together. In telling this story, my aim has been to show how menopause clinics have come to be established. My primary interest is not the 'official' account of menopause clinics\u00ad the account that tells of the development of menopause clinics and HRT as clever solutions to the problems of menopause. My focus centres on how collectives cfvery disparate people, technologies and practices have come to work together in the somewhat curious site of the menopause clinic -a curious site because of the obvious contradiction between the common understanding of menopause as a normal life event and the establishment of a specialised, medical site in which to manage this otherwise normal life transition. Informed predominantly by interactionist science studies, ] have focussed on the practices and interrelations of the menopause clinic. Interactionist science studies, rooted in the pragmatist tradition, has, as one of its major tenets, an emphasis on collective work and the interrelations of the members who participate in this work. Blurring the divisions between knowledge and practice, interactionist science studies looks to the practices and interrelations through which knowledge claims are made. In the menopause clinic, my focus has been on the socio-materia l practices and interactions of the technosocial collectives which make up the clinic network. It is through these practices and interactions, I have argued, that we can come to understand how knowledge claims about menopause are constructed and stabilised . In tracing this construction 1 have concentrated on the 'downstream phase' of this process. My employment ofa feminist framework together with an interactionist science studies approach has influenced this particular emphasis. Social studies of science, whose tools I also employ, has been criticised for focussing largely on the 'discovery phase' in scientific knowledge constructio n. Much of social studies of 215 Ch. 9: Conclusion science centres on laboratory studies of technological developments, with the analysis terminating at the stage when the technology emerges from the laboratory. In contrast, this study examines how particular technologies are taken up, used and shaped by users and consumers. The practices of these material technologies, in combinat ion with their users, are traced, and from these socia-material practices, particular meanings about menopause are generated. I argue that this kind of analysis which examines the <downstream action' is vital if we are to grasp science not as knowledge or beliefs that float above practices but rather as instantiated in everyday life through relays of practice. This focus on practice offers particular benefits to my analysis. The use of this analytical frame makes visible not only the standardising practices which work to construct and stabilise the menopause clinic. but also the ambiguous practices which both comply with this stabilisation process and yet resist it. Jt is these ambiguities that keep the menopause clinic in a state of flux and perpetual movement. Just as a microscope is used to resolve otherwise invisible images, so does this analytical frame make visible the tensions and contradictions of the menopause clinic. It is these tensions and abrasions between the various technosocial collectives ofthe clinic that opens up possibilitie s for change. In this concluding chapter I turn my attention to this potential for change. My commitment to research praxis underlies my reliance on narratives throughout this thesis. All hough I do not privilege these narratives over other fonns of data used, they provide not only an opportunity to hear the voices of the participants of this study, but they enable a solid grounding of the theory in data. The theory I employ is grounded not only in the stories of women going through menopause and the clinicians managing menopause in the clinics, but also in my observations of the practices, processes and interactions of the various social-material technologies operating in the clinic. Both the data and theory are worked reciprocally to produce an analysis grounded in empirical material. Following a review of the previous chapters. I turn, in this concluding chapter, to the implications of this research. In earlier sections I discussed in more detail the notion 216 Ch. 9: Conclusion of research praxis in thls study -the reciprocal integration of methodological practice and theory and how one informs, and is informed by the other. In discussing the implications of this research, I wish to emphasise this notion of praxis within which it is embedded. The issues, concerns and implication,s of this research are informed by the theoretical framework within which I work. Reciprocally, the analytical tools of interactionist science studies, feminism and actor network theory channel the issues I will raise. Analysts working with different theoretical registers would point to very different concerns arising out of this research. However, the concrete pragmatism and everyday concerns of my theoretical registers offer particular benefits in highlighting the implications of this study. Menopause, its management and menopause clinics are entrenched firmly in politics. This is an arena where, as a researcher, I am regularly asked to clarify my political position. Like most workers in this field, I am constantly urged 10 take sides. I am intrigued by the political controversies within this arena. These controversies centre around the long term use ofHRT, the most appropriate domain for the management of menopause, the availability of services for women, the privatisation of medical services and the use of alternative therapies in the management of menopause. ram similarly interested in how particular groups benefit over others, how certain practices are normalised and how the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency becomes dominant and other understandings of menopause are deleted. In Chapter 3 ( discussed the importance of breaking down the divide between community work and the academy. Increasingly , many scholars in social studies of science and interactionist science studies are suggesting that academic work should cease to shelter within the confines of the academy and be integrated and accessible to the communilY (Addelson, 1994; Manin, B., 1993; Manin, E.,1992). This study exemplifies my commitment to doing research which is both relevant and useful to the community in question. In my discussion of the political implications of this study, I address the direct concerns of those who work within the menopause arena. This study has involved the active participation of women attending menopause clinics, staff working within the clinics, as well as many others, who, although on the periphery of the menopause clinic arena, have shown a keen interest in the outcomes 217 Ch. 9: Conclusion and implications of this study. Menopause clinics in public hospitals currently occupy a tenuous position. With increased economic cutbacks to Australian health care , centres such as menopause clinics are targeted for budget reductions and possible closures. Menopause clinics are having to legitimate their continued funding and justify their position in serving community needs. Women seeking help for menopausal complaints are understandably concerned about the services available to them. Other groups implicated by the collective work of menopause clinics are similarly interested in the analysis of studies such as this one. In pursuing this work, 1 am therefore often asked about the political implications of this study for the management of menopause , Wary of \"'bottom line\" responses, I nonetheless appreciate the difficult political positions facing many of the collectives in the menopause arena and the necessity for reaching empirical conclusions. In this chapter I therefore outline, albeit tentatively , some implications arising from this study with regard to the management of menopause and offer suggestions for consideration. Reviewing preceding chapters As an introduction to my choice of analytica l framework , Chapter 2 reviewed the theoretical threads that infonned this study. Drawing particularly on interactionist science studies, I purposely crossed boundaries to also incorporate aspects of actor network theory and feminist theory into my theoretical framework. Key in my analysis of the menopau se clinic has been my inclusion of material and technological entities integral within this site. In my use of a theoretica l approach which bridges symbolic inleractioni sm and actor network theory, I take the work of these non human entities seriously My employment of symbolic interactionism with its humanist orientations may appear 10 be contradictory to actor network theolY's focus on the non human However. viewing actor network theory as a semiotic approach dispels some orchis contradiction . In a recent article, Mol and Mesman (1996) parallel the politics of symbolic interactionism and semiotic approaches (including actor network theory). In this paper, Mol and Mesman clarify how actor network theory conceive s material things as semiotic.: actors rather than as actors in the humanist sense. Mol and Mesman argue that for symbo lic interactionists , language is used to give meaning to things, With a semiotic approach, things and 218 eh. 9: Conclusion people are given meaning through interactions ~ entities co-construct each other. The emphasis placed by actor network theory on heterogeneous elements and the way these entities interact is of particular importance to this study. The menopause clinic is a site of collective work of social and material technologies. My use of the term 'technosocial collectives' is to emphasise the heterogeneity of the groups which make up the menopause clinic network. In addition, actor network theory's attention to action as network effects, and agency being generated from social-material interactions is also crucial to my analysis. Recently . an increasing number of feminist scholars have made insightful and significant contributions within interactionist science studies (Casper, 1994; Clarke & Fujimura, 1992; Fujimura, 1992; Star, 1992). The contribution of these scholars is to inject interactionist science studies with feminist concerns. In addition to addressing issues which concern and affect women, these scholars also emphasise the multiplicity of the groups being examined. Particular attention is drawn by these scholars to those collectives which occupy the periphery of the site under scrutiny as well as offering a political tenor to the issues addressed . It is these facets of feminist theory which are most pertinent to this study and its inclusion in my theoretical melange benefits my analysis. Chapter 3 outlined the method and methodol ogy employed in this research. As I have already discussed , key in this study is the notion of research as praxis and the reciprocal relationship between theory and methodologi cal practice. The methodology employed in this study is informed by my choice of theoretical registers, as is my theoretical analysis informed by my practice. Providing backdrop and empirical context, the historical discussion in Chapter 4 focused on the establishment of menopause clinics. In addition, this chapter broadly sketched the terrain of the menopauseciinics, their location and the general texture of the experiences taking place within them. The concept of menopause as hormone deficiency is not a pre-given natural entity but rather is a social construction imbued with cultural and political forces. The , purpose of Chapter 5 was not only to emphasise this point but also to make clear that other understandings of menopause are similarly social constructions. In 21<) Ch. 9: Conclusion reviewing the different constructions of menopause which have historically found favour in our social discourse, I stressed that the notion of menopause as hormone deficiency is only one of many possible ways to understand menopause. It is not by mere chance that menopause as hormone deficiency is the particular notion of menopause which has been taken up in menopause clinics and won such prevalence. It is pan of the social engineering of the menopause clinic that this particular understanding of menopause has been stabilised and come to dominate the medical arena and the day to day rmmopausal experiences of women. In discussing how menopause clinics have come to be robust institutions, the sanitised account tells of filling the gap in the lack of available services for the management of menopause. The reason for establishing menopause clinics is made to appear commonsensical, and thus becomes imbued with a certain taken for granted ness. The promotion of this sanitised account functions to quash any attempts to explore and expose the system of orderings within the menopause clinic. The retrospective story about the setting up of menopause clinics works to 'black box' this arena. I emphasise that the official story does not tell how the clinic in its current form has come to be. It does not tell how so many very disparate groups with very different sets of interests, needs, and understandings of menopause came to be collectively working together in a specialised, medical site which has become the menopause clinic. It also omits the constellation of social and political interests in which this coming together is embedded. In Chapter 6, I discussed how the technosocial collectives of the menopause clinic have come to be bound together and panicipate in the co-construction of the menopause clinic. J examined how the menopause clinic became the logical site for the management of menopause and menopause as hormone deficiency was made into a dominant belief across society. In this section, I attempted to reinsert the aniculation work which is deleted from the sanitised account of the establishment of the clinic. Employing the concept of \"boundary objects\", I showed how the notion of menopause as honnone deficiency acts as a useful translation device to bridge the different technosocia l collectives and to maintain a common interface to enable their continued collective work in the clinic. 220 Ch. 9: Conclusion An underlying theme oftrus thesis is that of practice and collective work. In Chapter 7 I drew on the nested routines and practices of the clinic to show how these work to stabilise the menopause clinic. Using the concept ofUstandardised packages\", I showed how stabilisation is an effect of the standardised practices and technologies of the clinic which are clotted together with the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency. The combination of these standardised technologies and this particular understanding of menopause enable the menopause! hormone deficiency package to hang together in the menopause clinic. Maintaining my focus on the social-material practices of the clinic, I also made a double move in showing how power relations are generated through the operation of these practices. I argued that agency in the menopause clinic is generated relationally through the interactions between the heterogeneous entities of the clinic. I emphasised the participation of material technologies in the way agency is generated in the clinic. The practices of the menopause clinic clearly exemplify that agency is not reserved to social relations, but operates also through material technologies . The crucial point here is not about agency per se, but about how agency is relational and the importance of including the material in our study of orderings. Despite the attempts of the clinic's practices towards stabilisation, I argued in Chapter 8 that the menopause clinic is fraught with tensions and abrasions. The construction work of the menopause clinic is counterba lanced with practices whose effects are destabilising . I suggested that these counteracting practices do not necessarily aim to destabilise the menopause clinic. Many of these practices both comply with the standardised menopause package and simultaneously disrupt it. Just as I havc argued that agency is shaped through the relations of the heterogenous elements of the clinic, it is these same relations which result in its unshaping . These counter practices offer us glimpses ofaltemative ways of managing menopause and possible different constructions of menopause . It is towards some of these possibilities which the remainder of this chapter is devoted. 221 Ch. 9: Conclusion Po/iticising menopause Menopause is highly politicised . Either as participant , analyst or observer in this arena, one is confronted with political decisions and urged to take sides. The power relations in this arena are palpable, My analysis has centred on the ways in which local practices. technologies and interactions of the clinic produce and shape power relations . Positioning my focus at this local level has enabled my examination of how particular knowledge claims, decisions and cOmrnltments have come to be so prevalent. Maintaining my analysis at the local level, I have examined the disruptions and tensions within the standardised menopause package. These interruption s impact not only at the local level but also have ramifications on a much wider scale. This type of analysis, although centred in local practices, is also significant in examining the macro structural forces which impinge on the menopause arena. This movement between micro and macro levels is essential in exploring the implications of this type of study and I take advantage of this in the following discussion of the politics of menopause . In the political arena of menopause certain issues have become highly controversial, specifically issues centring on menopausal management and the use ofHRT. (tum my attention in the following sections to addressing these issues, many of which are implicated in this study. In exploring these issues, I use the feminist interactionist science studies theoretical frame within which I am operating and ask about possibilities. It is not my aim to produce a list of objectives to solve these problems. Rather, I make use of the analytical framework employed in this thesis and examine, as Law and Mol (1995) suggest, the \"partial connections\" which arise trom this type of patchwork exploration. Domain for managing menopause? In previous discussions, I have made it clear that menopause clinics only playa small part in the management of menopause across the Australian community . With the advent of menopause clinics, questions are being posed regarding the most appropriate domain for the management of menopause . Should menopause clinics be 222 Ch. 9: Conclusion fostered or should general practitioners remain the primary providers of menopausal management?9& Hospital based menopause clinics see their role a~ specialist referral centres for the management ofmenopause9'}. Most menopause clinic practitioners advocate that menopause generally should be managed at a local community level by general practitioners, and menopause clinics be reserved for the management of difficult or complex cases of menopause. teaching and research.1OO The reasoning given for this is that menopause should be seen as a nonnallife transition and therefore is most appropriately managed by a practitioner who is familiar with the context of the woman's life. In an interesting analogy to obstetrics, one clinic practitioner described the distinction: It (menopause clinic) should be a tertiary referral centre. It's all too easy for us if we have someone who comes in and is having a normal menopause. That's not why we're here. We're supposed to be experts in a special area. It's like the whole concept of obstetrics where for many obstetricians their bread and butter economically is to do normal deliveries. Obstetricians weren't trained to do normal deliveries; they were trained to do difficult deliveries, deliveries that were not normal. Midwives are trained to do normal obstetrics. That's how I see us. We don't have to work at the grassroots level; that's not what we're trained for. (Mary, public menopause clinic practitioner) As 1 discussed previously. different categories of menopause are produced . Menopause is experienced along a gradient with <nonnal' menopause as the base. Only requiring \"grassroots\" management, 'normal' menopause becomes the province ,~ I limit my discussion to these two options. Thc types of management sites currently available to women arc limited b~' structural constraints. including the Medicare scheme.

'J'I Although public and private menopause clinics differ in the type of management provided. both sec thcmselvcs as having special expcnisc in menopausal managcment. I go on Lo discuss this funher in the next seclion on priv<Jlising menopause. IIKI The current consensus view or the Australian Menopause Socicty concurs with lhe opinion that the optimal person to manage menopause is the local general practitioner. with menopause clinics reserved for specialised management (Maclennan. 1991). Ch. 9: Conclusion of gene raj practitioner s. Further along the degrees of inclination of this gradient, however, is positioned the category of 'abnormal ' menopause which requires the specialised services of the menopause clinic. 223 The construction of these categories works t.o support the network of relations of the menopause clinic. This creation of a menopause gradient with categories of normal and abnormal menopause reinforces the menopause clinic as a specialist site and justifies the connecting links between the different technosocial collectives within this site. In addition, this works to reinforce the relations between menopause clinic practitioner s and community general practitioners . In most cases, women wanting to attend menopause clinics must first obtain a referral from their general practitioners . Categorising menopause as a gradient of normality supports this system of referral whilst maintaining the respective domains of clinic and general practitioners into \"grassroots\" and specialised menopausal managem ent. I want to pursue a little more the claim by menopause clinic practitioners that menopau se, in a general sense, should be managed in general practice. Problemati sing this claim reveals some inconsistencies . Women participating in this study overwhelmingly express much dissatisfaction with the help they had received fi . 1 .. IIJlAlh hh\u00b7\u00b7 their practitIOners . t aug t IS IS 0 VIOUS Y a las samp e , these women's claims still raise some important issues. The women in this study are clear about what they want in terms of menopau sal management: someone who will listen and is willing to spend time to listen to them expertise in the area of menopausal management support and understanding with regard to the complexity of menopause provision of information 1\"1 Logothetis ( 11)1):;) :1150 repons on the practitioners in temlS of menop<Hlsal nmnagcmenl. I!I~ Thc women in this study arc only a small proportion ofwollien going through menopause. 11 could also be assumcd that women who had receivcd satisractory help from their general practilioners would not be secking help from a menopau se clinic. 224 Ch. 9: Conclusion With these factors in mind, the reasons for women's dissatisfaction with their general practitioners become clear. First, menopausal management in general practice is a costly exercise. The practice in menopause clinics is to allocate a consultation time for first visits of at least 45 minutes, often extended to one hour. In the current Australian health care system, there are no financial incentives for general practitioners to conduct long consultations. 103 Women require an often long length of time to tell their stories, ask questions, receive support and gain information. The current health care system financially disadvantages general practitioners who allocate this time to the management of menopause and at the same time is disadvantaging women who require help for their menopausal complaints. General practitioners in Australia are the uJiIl/Jack of al1 trades of medicine\". General practitioners are faced with a variety of different medical (and non medical) problems and are expected to recognise, diagnose. and in straightforward cases, manage and treat the problem. With advances in clinical medicine, problems that were once managed by specialist practitioners have become the domain of general practitioners. An example of this is evident with the management of asthma in Australia. What was once the province of specialist respiratory physicians is now commonly managed by general practitioners . General practitioners are expected to gain the necessary expertise and skills in the management of an increasing number of problems, menopause being one of them. As I have made clear, the management of menopause is not simply a case of prescribing HRT, but also involves provision of information and suppon, understanding the complexity of problems faced by women and awareness of the resources available for women facing particular difficulties. The 1,,1 Under the turrent Medicare benefits schedulc, thc maximum schedule ree a general practitioner can carn ror a consultation oratleast40 minutes duralion is $A65.20. Both practitioncrs and women ilgrec thilt this is the minimum time required for managing menopausal concerns. with one hour consultations being the nomI. Taking a onc hour consultation as an cxample. a general practitioner can only cam $A65.20. However. the practitioner could reasonably see rour patients ror 15 minutes each during this timc. earning a total fee of$A98 ($A24.50 x 4) (Commonwealth Dcp..1rtmenl or Human Services and Health. 1995. p.27~29). Unless the general practitioner charges above the schedule fcc. there is liUle economic incentive in having long consultations. The situation in public menopau$C clinics differs in that medical practitioners arc paid a sessional fee for thc duration or the clinic session lime. The fees paid arc in accordance 10 the practitioners ' level or cxpertise and experience . Private menopause clinics work in a similar principle to general practice. However. many pmrate menopausc clinics charge a higher rate than the Medicare rcc and often cmploy private specialist practitioners who charge ol higher rate thiln general practitioners. 225 Ch. 9: Conclusion prescribing of HR T is itself often difficult, as dosages, routes of administration, women's tolerance and responses all need to be carefully balanced. To suggest that the most appropriate domain for the management ofmen9pause is general practice is to have high expectations of general practitioners. These practitioners are expected to have the appropriate expertise, skills and knowledge about menopause and its management (both in terms ofHRT and alternative therapies), an interest in menopause and aspects of women's health which impinge on menopausal management, as well as the time required to listen, provide support, infonnation and management advice. For many women taking HRT for menopausal complaints, or requiring regular bone scans for monitoring bone loss or other types of surveillance technologies, the high cost of these technologies often prohibit their continued use. For women not attending menopause clinics and seeking help from their general practitioners for menopausal complaints, the high cost ofHRT implants and bone scans to monitor osteoporosis is prohibitive. Many women who could benefit from these technologies find that they cannot afford them. Many public menopause clinics subsidise the cost of expensive hormona l implants, as well as bone scans, mammograms, and diagnostic tests. Women attending public menopause clinics value this subsidised care and claim they would be forced to cease their menopausal management if these subsidies were no longer available. Offering subsidies ensures women's return to menopause clinics and guarantees menopausal management for those women who could not otherwise afford it. This in turn safeguards the continued operation and maintenance of the clinic's network of relations. Despite the problems oflocating menopausal management in general practice, this domain does offer some benefits. Women in this study emphasised their sense of menopause as a life passage, as messy, and interrelated with other problems and life issues. Most women refused, or were unable, to divorce their menopause into a system of organ parts and saw their menopause as a complex interrelation. General practitioners , in their role as general managers of health problems, are, or should be, familiar with a woman's life circumstances -past health problems, responsibilities, family related difficulties and available resources. In many ways, general practice is 226 Ch. 9: Conclusion the most appropriate site for a woman to receive help for what is a life transition. However, lest this picture appears too rosy. in Australia we are seeing a decline of what is becoming the mythical family practitioner. This situation is particularly serious in rural areas where communities often lack any medical practitioners. With the advent of 24 hour medical clinics, increased use of locum practitioners, and diminishing economic incentives, the traditional family community practitioner who looks after you and your family during a life time is slowly disappearing. Increasingly we are moving away from a holistic medical model towards one of \u00abfractured medicine\" , Women seeking help during menopause may solicit specific menopausal advice at a menopause clinic, see their general practitioner for coughs and colds. and a naturopath for alternative therapy. This fractured care contradicts the holistic management of health related problems. In considering these issues, I concur with the menopause clinic practitioners in their view that the most appropriate province in which to manage menopause is general practice. Menopause clinics should therefore be reserved for managing difficult or complex problems. and for teaching and research where an institutional infrastructure is required. Menopause, as expressed by the many women participating in this study, is a normal life event, a life passage which should be managed in the context of other life transitions . Women expressed a desire that their integrated menopausal complaints be managed in a holistic manner, with the complexities which they face treated as a whole. Professional and private responsibilities all impinge on a woman's menopause , as do other health problems . In general practice, the totality of these responsibilities and problems can be addressed in the context ofa woman's current menopausal complaints. Management strategies can be proposed which take into account a woman '5 responsibi lities, obligations and available resources . However, I hasten 10 add that the current situaLion in general practice is far from ideal and many of the problems I have raised need to be addressed . In discussions with general practitioner s, it is clear that the major difficulty they face is the economics of long consultations with women who need time to discuss problems and options around menopause . 104 To address this problem, both macro structural and 1\"\u00b71 In the feedback process of conducting Uus study, formal and informal seminars and talks were organised with both menopause clinic practitioners as well as general practitioners involved in the 227 eh. 9: Conclusion micro reforms are necessary . Clearly the current Australian Medicare system does not offer financial incentives to general practitioners to spend time with patients who require long consultations for the management of their problems. Structural adjustments are required to assess and rectify these discrepancies . The employment of general practitioners in the primary management of menopause must be made cost effective over hospital services. However, it is also clear that the focus needs to be shifted from primary economic concerns to professional and personal incentives. As many practitioners pointed Qut to me. they have much to gain both personally and professionally in supporting women through the management of their menopause . Dale, a menopause clinic practitioner, articulated this point: It's a great privilege to consult the climacteric woman. She brings the great richness of her life; her life seems to come to a particular quintessential focus. To take her history and to [earn a little bit about that woman's life is quite an awesome process. One's role as a medical practitioner takes on a whole different number of roles and one's listening skills have to improve daily. (Dale, menopause clinic practitioner) Together with economic discrepancies, education strategies also need to be addressed. To enable and improve the primary care of menopause in general practice, the expertise of general practitioners needs to be improved, together with a greater awareness of issues around menopause. Menopause education targeted towards general practitioners is carried out by a number of menopause clinic practitioners . In an effort to improve the expertise and awareness of general practitioners on menopause related issues, regular professional meetings are held, in addition to graduate and continuing education courses. lOS Women seeking help in general practice must also participate in improving this awareness of menopausal issues. In making clear their needs and requirements, women partake in the decision making and management of the menopause. management of menopause.

This is run as weekend courses or as a distance education programme to enable practitioners in rural areas to complete the coursc. 228 Ch. 9: Conclusion Privatising menopausal management The establishment of private menopause clinics has been an interesting phenomenon in the management of menopause . The role of most private menopause clinics is to fill the gap between inadequate or inappropriate local general practice services and the specialist services of public menopause clinics. Like public clinics, private menopaus e clinics claim special expertise in the management of menopause . However, in contrast to public clinics, private clinics also provide primary and preventive gynaecological related care (pap smears, treatment of vaginal infections etc). Women attending private clinics are able to return on a long term basis for ongoing care, unlike in public clinics where women are returned to their referring general practitioner once their menopausal complaints are under control. As well as this difference in roles. private menopause clinics are self funding, unlike public clinics which are funded from the public hospital health care budget. In establishing private menopause clinics, practitioners recognised the difficulties in managing menopause within general practice, such as the economic problems associated with long consultations. and the lack of expertise and interest in menopausal management from many general practitioner s. Private clinics thus currently act as an intermediary service between local general practitioners and public menopause clinics. in that they offer primary menopausal management within a specialist setting. Public clinics as I discussed previously, operate as specialist referral centres. This is exemplified in the proportional numbers of general and specialist medical practitioners in public and private clinics. 106 During the period of my fieldwork, in the 3 participati ng public clinics, there were 7 general practitioners (all female) and 9 medical specialist practitioners (6 female and 3 male)~ in the 2 private clinics. there were 17 general practitioners (all female) and 6 medical lIN, Specialisalion in lemlS of menopausal managemenl covers a \\\\ide spectrum. This specialisation ranges from the general practitioner working in the menopause clinic with special knowledge . inlerest and skills in managing menopause. to specialist pracLitioners. such as endocrinologists and gynaecologis ts. who. as part of their specialist trai.ning and additional qu.1Iifications. have gained specialisl expertise in the managemen t of menopause . 229 ell. 9: Conclusion specialist practitioners (2 female and 4 male). 107 The emphasis of public menopause clinics is on specialist care, with specialist practitioners in attendance at every session, and available for consultation. Private clinics on the other hand focus on primary menopausal management with specialist practitioners only working on a sessional basis. Women in private clinics who require specialised management are then referred to the relevant specialist practitioners within the clinic. Private menopause clinics are self funding, relying on consultations, and in some cases, private donations to survive. In the current economic climate, private clinics are increasing ly reliant on good marketing strategies and appropriate targeting of the market. Emphasis on convenience, in addition to specialist management , is used to attract busy women who cannot afford the often lengthy waiting times of the public menopause clinics. Appeals to women's sense of responsibility in looking after their own health, particularly in terms of prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease, are widely used. Menopausal women are not passive recipients of these marketing strategies . Although initially serving to enrol women to the clinic, this strategy aimed towards preventive care is often not long lasting. Many women who respond to this call for preventive health care only attend the clinic oncc. They attend the clinic to have the appropriate checks and receive the infonnation they require which then enables them to appropriately manage their menopause . Taking control of the management of their menopause , many women find that the clinic's recommended annual visits are unnecessa ry.lUH Many private menopause clinics are also widening their scope to avoid possible closure. In addition to menopausal management , private clinics are also now offering management of adolescent women's health, weight control, contraception , breast examination and infertility referral and treatment . Menopause clinics are currently in a vulnerable situation. Economic rationalism in public health funding has required public hospitals to reassess their services, and 1,,-These ligures only include medical practition crs: nurses, receptionists . managers and educators are omitLed. A1so omitted arc the medical registrars rotaling through the public hospital menopaus e clinic as part of their general training. II*' One of lhe two private clinics participating in the study has closed down since the period of my lieldwork due. in parL to financial difficulties from women choosing not to return to the clinic. 2)0 Ch. 9: Conclusion become more efficient whilst tightening their budgets. Current proposals to privatise outpatient services in public hospitals may see a change in the current structure of public menopause clinics. This restructuring is designed to shift costs from the state health budget to the Commonwealth budget via the Medicare rebate scheme. However , private clinics are also under financial pressure. Current economic uncertaintie s mean that women have to carefully assess and prioritise the financing of their health needs. Private menopause clinics currently have to work hard to enrol women. The use of marketing strategies by private clinics, such as the recruitment of women via seminars which emphasise the need for HR.T to maintain good health as women age, could result in a blowout of health costs for the treatment of menopau saJ women. As 1 have argued, the existing network of relations within the clinic is not static and is susceptible to disruptions , tensions and change. If public clinics are privati sed it is likely that they will move away from a tertiary only service provision. In order to maintain a sufficiently large patient base, it is likely that there will be an intensification of pressures by these clinics on women to enter experimental regimes. such as the long tenn use ofHRT for prevention offractures. Services for which menopausal women? All women experience menopause . However, not ail women who require help during menopause receive it. There is little demographic data available regarding which groups of women seek and receive help for menopau sal management. 109 However, the available data shows some inconsistenc ies in its findings. Studies of relatively small groups of women attending menopause clinics suggest that these women are largely well educated, self referred, and have an existing interest in their own health (Hamburger & Anderson, 1990). Studies oflarger groups of women in the community show no significant difference in levels of education, level of well being and health behaviour between groups of women who utilise health care services i'~J There is liule infonnation in the existing literature about the proportion of women who actually seck help for menopausal complaints. Current Australian dala suggest that from 50% (Wren & Brown. 191) I) to 73% of peri menopausal women (Abraham. L1ewellyn~Jo nes . & Perl. 11)95) seek help for menopausal concerns. However these figures are generated from only small samples of women. Logothetis (1993) suggests that although women may e:\\\"J>Crience some menopausal complainls. these complaints arc not sufficiently distressing for them to seek help. 231 Ch. 9: Conclusion compared to those women who choose not to seek health cafe services around the period of their menopause (Morse, Green, Hopper, & Burger, 1994). This paucity of information does not indicate ethnicity, socia economic s~atus or level of available health care resources fOT women around menopause. It was not the aim of this study to acquire such demographic statistical data on the women attending menopause clinics. However , from my observations and direct questioning of the menopause clinic staff regarding the demographic groups of women attending menopause clinics, the absence of various groups of women is clear. This absence highlights particular areas which require attention, particularly in tenns of women's ethnicity, disability, sexuality and locality. Menopausal women are not a homogeneous group. However , it appears that many groups of women who may require services are currently marginalised in the menopause arena. The needs of these marginalised groups are not being addressed and with few exceptions, specific services are not being provided. Notably, most women attending the five participating public and private menopause clinics were Anglo Saxon. Only a few other ethnic groups were represented despite many of the clinics being located in areas which have a large multicultural population . Anthropological and cross cultural literature clearly outline the different cultural interpretations of menopause . many of which stand in sharp contrast to the Western focus on medicalisation and hOffilone deficiency 1986~ Toil, 19(0). In light of these different cultural interpretations and understand ing or menopause, services provided in Australia largely conform to the Anglo model with respecl to knowledge claims and management practices of menopause . Many large public hospital menopause clinics provide interpreter services as part of their infrastructure. Although the provision of these services addresses language difficulties , they do not necessarily address cultural difficulties . As Giftard ( 1(94) points out in her study of Halo-Australian working class women, Lhese women's cultural beliefs about menopause are clearly linked to their belief abouL their social worth, which subsequently impinges on their use of health services either for problem-related or prevention-related reasons. 232 Ch. 9: Conclusion With one exception , no participating menopause clinics provided specialist services specifically designed to provide culturally appropriate menopause management. The sole exception to this was the provision of a Greek women's menopause clinic. This clinic was established to address the needs of the large Greek population in the locality in which the clinic is situated. The Greek women's clinic operates at the same site as the mainstream menopause clinic. However, special session times are organised at which a Greek-speaking medical practitioner is in attendance together with a non-Greek-speaking medical practitioner, with a Greek interpreter available if required. In addition to menopausal management, this clinic conducts research into the needs of the Greek women who attend the clinic and into the cultural appropriateness of the services provided. During the period of my fieldwork I was fortunate to experience two situations which served to sensitise me to the fact that menopause is an experience of all women. One of the experiences involved a conversation with Jean, a woman I met in the waiting area of a menopause clinic. Jean had a congenital physical disability which meant that much of her time was spent in a wheelchair. Jean's disability was compounded by a large number of other physiological problems, all exacerbated by the social difficulties she experienced in her daily personal and professional life. Jean was familiar with problems of access, lack of available resources , and levels of discrimination faced by many disabled people. However, in addition to these problems, Jean was now going through menopause and experiencing difficulties . Jean explained to me the obstacles she had faced in having her problems identified as menopausal and the lack of awareness and understanding of her consulting practitioners . Jean faced acute embarrassment from her physician in discussing issues around sexuality. Menopause , disability and sexuality were not a combination which many practitioners felt comfortable discussing , and Jean felt dispirited at not being able to find the heip she was seeking. The second incident involved an interview with Kyla, a woman who had enthusiastically agreed to participate in this study. Kyla and I met in her home as arranged . I soon realised as we proceeded with the interview that Kyla had a history 233 Ch. 9: Conclusion of episodic mental illness, for which she was still on medication . Throughout the interview, Kyla impressed me with her many insightful and articulate responses . However , these were interspersed with incidental delusory claims and referrals to what I later realised were false claims of persecution and harassment. Following this interview I was left confused and unsettled as to what to make of the data I had collected. Questions of the data's validity and reliability puzzled me. Overwhelming however, was the sense that women with psychiatric disabilities also experience menopause and I pondered the suitability of services available to them. I tell Jean's and Kyla's stories to highlight the heterogeneity of women going through menopause. Although I am not suggesting that separate specialist services should be made available for the multiple groups of women facing menopause, I would argue for greater awareness of differences amongst women. The image of the stereotypic menopausal woman -white, middle-aged and married with children needs to be challenged . Issues of sexual orientation and sexuality need to be openly acknowledged . 1 have earlier discussed the problems which many women going though menopause face regarding their sense of self and identity. Issues of sexuality impinge on identity and need to be addressed and discussed when dealing with the interrelated complexity of menopause. Women from rural areas who participated in this study confinned the problems of distribution of health care services widely reported in the local press and government reports. Specific to menopausal services, most women emphasised their preference for women practitioner s. The paucity of health care services in many rural areas makes this demand for women doctors impossible to fulfil. Some regional centres have no medical practitioner s in their area, least of all a female practitioner or specialist menopausal physician . This lack of services in rural areas means that women must travel to a major city to seek help, which in rural Australia often means travelling for many hours to reach the nearest large metropolitan centre. Focussing on the practices of the menopause clinic highJights issues of concern, one of these being for which groups of women are menopausal services provided. The Ch. 9: Conclusion experiences of the women participating in this study make clear that current services do not address the needs of the many different groups of women who require help during menopause. Women of non-Anglo cultures, women with disabilities, women living in rural areas, and women who do not fit the. menopause stereotype are all on the periphery of the menopause clinic network. This marginalised position is reinforced by a lack of awareness and understanding of these women's particular needs in terms of menopausal management. Just as general practitioners need to be aware of their local community needs and attempt to satisfy these, menopause clinic practitioners also need to be aware that their consulting population is not homogenous. Addressing these women's experiences of menopause, their requirements and expectations, can only lead to improved services and greater awareness of the heterogeneity of women. Using therapies For many, menopause has become synonymous with HRT. The strength of this link is indicative of the stability of the network of relations linking the two. Despite the robustness of this link, the use ofHRT remains highly controversial. Some feminists disparage the use ofHRT in (010 for the management of menopause, denouncing the pathologi sation of menopau se, the unknown long term effects ofHRT, and the effects of the patriarchal medical system on what should be a natural life event (Birnbaum , 1990; Dumble, 1992; Klein, 1 992a; Klein, I 992b). Others, however, see the use ofHRT for the short term management of acute menopausal complaints as overcoming medical neglect and lack of concern for the health of older women. The issue under most recent debate concerns the long term use of HR T for the prevention of osteoporosis and heart disease. Advocates oflong term hormone therapy suggest commencement ofHRT from the age of45-55 yrs when ovarian function begins to decline. For greatest benefit, it is recommended that therapy should continue for at least 10-15 years, and preferably be extended beyond the age 0[65 years (Wren, 1993). With an expected life expectancy of80 years, Australian women can anticIpate being on HRT for about 35 years (Wren, 1990). 235 Ch. 9: Conclusion I have previously discussed the issue of compliance with regard to HRT. Both women and general practitioners prescribing HRT show equal concern regarding the unknown long term effects of HR.T, its cost and need for constant monitoring, as well its associated serious side effects. Much of the rnedicalliterature has constructed menopausal women who cease HR T as 'non compliant' and strategies are proposed to alleviate this lack of compliance. It is therefore interesting to note the trajectory ofHRT development. Initially. HRT was available only orally. Recent developments have led to the increased use of vaginal hormonal creams, pessaries and rings. Hormonal transdermal patches are now in greater use. The means of administration of all these methods permit stopping when required. The development and use of subcutaneous hormonal implants however, circumvents the possibility of stopping therapy immediately . As a recent review ofHRT developments states, Hlmplants have one major advantage over other methods, namely guaranteed compliance .... they cannot be easily removed should this become necessary\" (Ellerinb'10n , Whitcroft , & Whitehead, 1992, p. 406). This strategy for ensured compliance parallels the use of hormonal implants, such as Norplant, developed to prevent conception . As many feminists have protested with the use of the contraceptive implants, any possibility of choice on the part of the woman once the implant is administered is removed (Helwig, 1994). As I have argued previously. HRT is a central actor in the standardised menopause package and its long term use ensures the stabilisation of the clinic's network of relations. Women seeking help in menopause clinics emphasised their requirement for multiple therapeutic and management options, with no HRT as an option. Synonymous with this, is the requirement for information on available management options. Women not only want to know what their choices are, but they also want to know the risks and benefits of each of these choices. 110 As an option to HRT, many women turn to the use of alternative therapies. This decision is largely governed by concerns with II\" Women in this stud .... also make clear lhallhcy want inronnation provided not only at the first consultation . but also at subsequent consultations . Many women. having cx-perienccd long term problems. arc desperate to get help and reel unable to weigh up their options unlil their complaints arc under control. For this reason. women often only begin 10 balance the risks and benefits ofHRT after their complaims have slabilised. at which time they require further information. Ch. 9: Conclusion the long term effects ofHRT, in particular the risks of cancer, and also a desire to use a more 'natural' product. 236 Increasingly, the use of these 'natural' therapies is also coming under close scrutiny . Critiques directed at alternative medicine are similar to those voiced by the women in this study who ceased taking alternative therapies after initially commencing them. Crawford (1980) criticised alternative therapies for alienating those who are financially disadvantaged and could perhaps most benefit from them. Women in this study concurred with this view as they denounced the high cost of alternative therapies with no subsidy or rebate available. The cost of these products is compounded by the necessity to often take large volumes for maximum benefit Further critiques centre on the symbolic representations of 'natural' therapies. Contradictions and ambiguities arise when some herbal therapies are defined as natural and non-synthetic. and yet can be toxic in high doses, while many chemical products, derived from naturally occurring substances are deemed not to be natural (Coward, 1989).111 In addition, are the concerns about the components and effects of naturopat hic and herbal therapies used to manage menopausal complaints. Women expressed concern about the little infonnation available regarding the basis of many of these preparations . The politics of menopause therefore is not centred solely on HRT and medical management. The use of alternative therapies is also political and remains a cause of concern within the menopause arena. Blurring boundaries I began this thesis acknowledging the valuable contributions of feminist critiques in analysing the constructio n of menopause. Feminists, from the late 19605 onwards, have heavily influenced the public debate about the medicalisation of menopause , the controve rsial use of HRT and the exploitation of women by the 'menopause industry'. Feminist scholars redressed the paucity of information about menopause , while challenging existing notions and contributing new conceptualisations of III These same ambiguities arise in the promOlion of HRT as 'nalUra]' oestrogcns; for example. the prommion Ogen natural human homlones. 217 Ch. 9: Conclusion menopause . However , I argue that within feminist critiques of menopause are existing gaps which need to be addressed . Many feminist critiques reinforce the dichotomy between the biological and social, and what is I).atural and unnatural. Much feminist debate about menopause refuses to look beyond menopause as ideology, with little attention given to the work of practices in the construction of meanings and ideologie s. Similarly. the technical and material are omitted from much offerninist analysis, with emphasis placed largely on the social. In this study, I have purposely attempted to blur the boundaries between the biological and social, the social and the material, and what is considered natural and unnatura1. Many feminist scholars denounce the use of unnaturaJ intervention s in what is thought to be a natural, nonnallife event. HR.T is heavily criticised for being an unnatural agent in a woman's natural experience of menopause. However , how is unnatural defined? If HR T is considered unnatural, what about phytoestrogen s? Both are interventions which replace deficient hormones and both have at one point been derived from \"natural\" sources. Yet, HRT is constructed as unnatural and phytoestrogens are considered a natural and safe alternative. Indeed, are women's experiences of menopau se natural? The women in this study make clear the messiness of menopause. and speak of the blurring of the social and the biological. In what categories do we place the depression some women experience , their mood swings and their loss of sexual libido? Are these social or biological signs, or, as the women themselves state, a complex interrelation of the two? The ways technologies such as score charts, bone scans and ultrasound shape the current understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency similarly dissolve the distinction between the social and the material. I suggest that we need more feminist work which is willing to open up these debates and is prepared to blur boundarie s and become entangled in the complexity to which this inevitably leads. In the final analysis, feminist critiques which stop at the level of ideology are not very useful to the woman confronted with the decision whether to take HR.T for her acute menopausal symptoms, or the woman at risk of osteoporosis who is deciding on her options for prevention. In practice, what do women do? What is clear is that women 23& Ch. 9: Conclusion require information and support to be able to decide on the most appropriate strateb'Y for them. Women are not passive recipients in the menopause arena. Menopausal women are active in their construction of menopause and their use of strategies to enable them to become managers of their menopause. Menopause is not a uniform experience, and menopausal women arc characterised by their multiplicity and heterogeneity . It is therefore inappropriate and unreasonable to advocate uniform recommendations for all menopausal women. As Singleton (1996) points out with respect to the use of routine smear tests for the detection of cervical cancer, advocating that women should take part in such a programme is based on an oppressive discourse which induces a sense of guilt in women who do not participate . In contrast, Singleton suggests that to incorporate the multiplicity of identities and the complexity ofwomen's responses and experiences. we need to talk about whether women could participate. For many women experiencing serious menopausal complaints, short term use ofHRT may be a viable and useful strategy, alone or in combination with other therapies. Long term use oflffi.T remains a contentious issue, but for women at high risk of osteoporosis and heart disease, this option may be beneficial. Women need to be equipped with the necessary information and services to make informed decisions about how to best manage their menopause . Just as it is inappropriate for some in the medical community to advocate uniform use ofHRT, it is similarty not reasonable for women to feel guilty about taking HR T. In practice, HR T is an option for some women experiencing difficulties , certainly not the only option and definitely not for all women. However , for those women for whom it could be beneficial, it deserves the appropriate recognition. Summary This has been a story about collective work -the work of many disparate collectives as they come together to establish the menopause clinic. Like all stories, this one is woven of many threads. One strand challenges the seamlessness of the official account of menopause as hormone deficiency . This account of menopause , together with the many other accounts used in social discourse , are not pre given but are the 239 Ch. 9: Conclusion outcomes of social and cultural constructions. This strand is securely interwoven with the second thread which examines the establishment of the menopause clinic. The menopause clinic offers an interesting and apt site in which to challenge and explore this particular construction of menopause. Situated in the locale of the clinic, I explored the collective constructio n work whose outcome is the stabilisation of the menopause clinic and its intricate network of relations. The establishment of the menopause clinic is an effect of the coming together of disparate technosocial collectives and the collective building of a network of nested practices and relations which work to hold it together. Having established the menopause clinic, its stability is not however secured. Together, the various technosocial collectives work hard at maintaining the network of relations within and beyond the clinic. The social-material practices of the clinic operate to stabilise the clinic's network, and through these practices, the concomitant conceptualisation of menopause as hormone deficiency is reinforced and strengthened. Despite these efforts at stabilisation, the clinic and the understanding of menopause as hormone deficiency is fraught with contradictions, disruptions and constant cha!1enges . It is through these interruptions that we realise that this particular outcome of the menopause clinic and this particular understanding of menopause are only one of many possible consequences -that it could have been otherwise. A feminist framework has greatly influenced my awareness of gender, and all its multiplicities , as an important analytical category. The focus of this analytical approach is on doing research which benefits women and ensures their visibility. In the menopause arena, women clients are crucial actors, not just as consumers but as important players in the construction of knowledge about menopause. Women construct different kinds of understanding about menopause and make possible new ways of seeing and knowing menopause . lnteractionist science studies, through its focus on collective work and practice, is also concerned with the construction of knowledge . This approach is levelled at the practices of users and consumers as they collectively construct links and connectio ns, through which meanings are generated. Together , these two approaches have contributed to my focus on the user phase of knowledge construction, often lacking in social studies of science. Increasingly, 24() Ch. 9: Conclusion feminist social studies of science scholars are pointing in this direction and calling for more work which emphasises this focus. As exemplified in this study. crossing theoretical boundaries has much to offer as gaps are addressed. different directions highlighted and new analytical approaches proposed . Although the story I have told is largely theoretical , I emphasise that this is research as praxis. My theoretical register is very much grounded in data and is informed by the data from which it originates . Much work is required if we are to take seriously the call to bridge the gap between the community and the academy. I have therefore concluded with a discussion of the social and political implication s of this study to illustrate my conviction to undertaking research which is socially useful to the community on which it is based. Menopause is a highly politicised arena. The provision of menopau sal services is under constant threat of reductions and possible closure. I am convinced of the value and importance of social reforms through changes to micro practices. The use of an interactionist theoretical framework provides a lens through which to analyse how, together with why. the menopause clinic has come to be. This focus is levelled at local practices and processes. However, my analysis moves beyond the local level and examines the global struggles emerging from this arena. The micro-macro distinction is dissolved as local practices are examined and used to suggest approaches on a wider scale. My employment of a feminist interactionist science studies approach blurs the boundaries between knowledge and practice. Through this focus, not only do potential new pracLict;!s become apparent but also new ways of making knowledge . It is therefore not only with alternative practices in the management of menopause that I conclude, but also with new ways of seeing and understanding menopause through the enactmcnt of these practices.
