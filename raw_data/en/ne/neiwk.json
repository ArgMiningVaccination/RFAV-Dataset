[Naturopathic physicians](https://aanmc.org/naturopathic-medicine/) are trained as primary care providers who diagnose, treat and manage patients with acute and chronic conditions, while addressing disease and dysfunction at the level of body, mind and spirit. NDs concentrate on whole-patient wellness through health promotion and disease prevention, finding the underlying cause of the patient's condition. They provide individualized, evidence-informed therapies that balance the least harmful and most effective approaches to help facilitate the body's inherent ability to restore and maintain optimal health. Naturopathic physicians care for patients of all ages and genders. NDs tailor treatment protocols for each patient, placing a strong emphasis on prevention, patient education and self-care. Naturopathic medicine is based upon six fundamental principles: - First, do no harm: Utilize the most natural, least invasive and least toxic therapies. - The healing power of nature: Trust in the body's inherent wisdom to heal itself. - Identify and treat the causes: Look beyond the symptoms to the underlying cause. - Physician as teacher: Educate patients in the steps to achieving and maintaining health. - Treat the whole person: View the body as an integrated whole in all its physical and spiritual dimensions. - Prevention: Focus on overall health, wellness and disease prevention. Naturopathic physicians collaborate with all other branches of the healthcare team, referring patients to other health care practitioners for diagnosis or treatment when appropriate.
