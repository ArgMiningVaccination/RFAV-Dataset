and 3 4 Whereas, The Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) standards for academic year 5 2019 -2020 outline the goals for education to build communication skills (Standard 7.8) and 6 interprofessional collaborative skills (Standard 7.9) that can be actualized through TBL3; and 7 8 Whereas, The American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) standards on medical 9 education include Entrustable Professional Activities (EPA), which have the goal of training 10 medical students as collaborative members of an interprofessional team (EPA 9), directly 11 aligning with TBL4; and 12 13 Whereas, TBL has been successfully implemented in a variety of contexts including courses in 14 preclinical physiology5, professionalism1, medical ethics6, and anatomy7 across all medical 15 student years; and 16 17 Whereas, TBL can also be integrated into existing courses and electives that review patient 18 cases, allowing students to gain exposure to solving cases as a clinical team and thereby 19 increase clinical preparedness in future physicians8; and 20 21 Whereas, While TBL may be implemented as a separate course, in the case of limited sp ace in 22 the medical school curriculum, TBL can also be implemented in practical lab -work sessions or 23 small group sessions that already take place in the curriculum5; and 24 25 Whereas, A number of medical schools across the nation have integrated TBL into their 26 curriculum and reported improvement as compared to traditional lecture -based curriculum in 27 students' preparation, quality of in -class discussions, critical thinking, academic performance, 28 and collaboration among faculty members9; and 29 30 Next Table of ContentsResolution 01 (A-19) Page 2 of 4 Whereas, Multiple stu dies on learning outcomes in health professional schools (including a 1 recent large meta -analysis) have demonstrated an improvement of knowledge of subject matter, 2 as measured by course examinations, standardized tests, and course grades, after 3 implementati on of TBL as compared to other instructional methods including traditional lecture - 4 based curriculum10, 11; and 5 6 Whereas, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Core 7 Competencies support the acquisition and maintenance of Interper sonal and Communication 8 Skills, which can be achieved through TBL12; and 9 10 Whereas, The successful integration of TBL into several graduate medical education (GME) 11 program curricula (including residency programs in internal medicine, psychiatry, and primary 12 care) has been well -received by residents and faculty educators, who reported statistically 13 significant increases in knowledge acquisition outcomes through team assessments and 14 increased learner engagement and interactivity as compared to traditional lect ure-based 15 teaching methods13-16; and 16 17 Whereas, Outside of formal GME program curricula, educational sessions/workshops at 18 national medical conferences could serve as opportunities to incorporate TBL into continuing 19 medical education17; therefore be it 20 21 RESOLVED, That the AMA -MSS support the integration of team -based learning 22 coursework/modules in medical school education, graduate medical education, and continuing 23 medical education . 24 25 Fiscal Note: Minimal, 4 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY H-295.995 Recommendations for Future Directions for Medical Education : (10) Medical school faculties should continue to exercise prudent judg ment in adjusting educational programs in response to social change and societal needs. H-295.868 Education in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness During Medical School and Residency Training : (2) Our AMA encourages medical schools and residency programs to utilize multiple methods, including simulation, disaster drills, interprofessional team -based learning, and other interactive formats for teaching disaster medicine and public health preparedness . 295.122 MSS Modernization of Medical Education Assessment and Medical School Accreditation: AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to: (1) vigorously work to establish medical education system reforms throughout the medical education continuum that demand evidence - based teaching methods that positively im pact patient safety or quality of patient care; and (2) work with the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) to perform frequent and Resolution 01 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 extensive educational outcomes assessment of specialized competencies in the medical school accreditation process at minimum every four years, requiring evidence showing the degree to which educational objectives impacting patient safety or quality of patient care are or are not being attained. (MSS Res 9, A -04) (AMA Res 818, I B, I-09) (Reaffirmed: MSS GC Report A, I -16) AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 02 (A-19) Introduced by: Regions 3, Region 4, Region 5, Region 7; Autumn Hargraves, Des Moines University; Asmi Panigrahi, Rutgers New Jersey Medical School , M. Us man Ahmad, University of South Florida Morsani College of M edicine l Subject: Health Impact of Per - and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Contamination in Drinking Water Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) determines whether a contaminant 1 should have an enforceable regulatory standard for water contamination based on three criteria 2 including: a) adverse effect on the health of persons, b) the contaminant is known to occur in 3 public water often enough at levels of concern, c) regulation provides a meaningful opportunity 4 for health risk reductions1; and 5 6 Whereas, Polyfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFAS) are chem icals used in the manufacturing of 7 thousands of industrial and consumer products and are recognized by the Center of Disease 8 Control (CDC) as substances toxic to human health2; and 9 10 Whereas, PFAS are non -biodegradable chemicals that accumulate in the human body with 11 elimination half -lives up to 12 years and as of July 2018 PFAS have been detected at 172 sites 12 in 40 states and have resulted in more than 3000 environmental and health related publications 13 since 20002-6; and 14 15 Whereas, PFAS' negative health effects include but are not limited to increased risk of 16 hypertension, pre -eclampsia, and low birth weight during pregnancy, endocrine disru ption, 17 increased risk of thyroid and kidney disease, and association with various cancers2,7,8; and 18 19 Whereas, PFAS cross the placental barrier, are detected in cord blood, are transmitted through 20 breast milk, and are negatively associated with fetal and postnatal growth, immune function, and 21 reproductive health9-12; and 22 23 Whereas, Children are particularly at risk due to differences in P FAS dosimetry , impact on 24 physical and cognitive development, and in particular, dose -dependent immunomodulatory 25 effects w hich dampen responses to vaccines9,13,14; and 26 27 Whereas, The EPA found PFAS in water and soil nationwide, labeled PFAS an \"emerging 28 contaminant,\" and in May 2016 released non -enforceable lifetime health advisories for two 29 specific PFAS chemicals: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane Table of Contents PreviousResolution 02 (A-19) Page 2 of 9 of 70 ppt, above this level the EPA recommends that drinking water systems takes steps to 1 assess contamination, inform consumers, and limit exposure15,16; and 2 3 Whereas, In November 2016, the American Public Health Association stated that all exposures 4 to PFAS should be reduced, and in June 2018, the CDC's Agency for Toxic Substances and 5 Disease Registry (ATSDR) recommended reducing the minimum risk levels of PFAS ten -fold, 6 from 70 ppt to 7 ppt due to the chemicals' significant negative health effects2,17; and 7 8 Whereas, The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the World Health 9 Organization (WHO) has classified PFOA as possibly carcinogenic to humans18; and 10 11 Where as, The EPA sets Maximum Contaminant Level Goals (MCLG) at zero for contaminants 12 that may cause cancer1, and 13 14 Whereas, T he EPA maintains the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS), an electronic 15 database that contains information on human health effects from exposure to various 16 substances in the environment, in which PFOA is not classifie d as to its carcinogenicity19,20; and 17 18 Whereas, In February 2019, the EPA published its PFAS Action Plan which included as 19 priorities initiating processes for listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous substances and 20 organizing efforts for water supply clean -up, but does not commit to setting maximum 21 contaminant levels (MCLs)21,22; and 22 23 Whereas, A Congressional PFAS Task F orce was established in January 2019 to educate and 24 draft policies on PFAS based on the latest research, and a Senate bill in March 2019, calls for 25 PFAS to be designated as a hazardous chemical within a year and require cleanup of 26 contaminated sites23,24; and 27 28 Whereas, Despite the CDC's recommendations, urging from various U.S. senators, and 29 examples from various states which have established their own PFAS water guidelines, no 30 federal PFAS drinking water standards have yet been implemented16,25 -28; and 31 32 Whereas, The CDC blood lead level limits ar e based on a reference blood lead level based on 33 the 97.5th percentile of the blood lead level distribution among children 1 -5 years old in the 34 United States, which is currently a 5 ug/dL lead level in children29; and 35 36 Whereas, A similar reference blood PFAS level to aim to reduce average PFAS blood levels in 37 US children to as low a level as possible could be based on the 95th percentile of total serum 38 concentration of PFAS in U.S. children, which as per th e most recent study of National Health 39 and Nutritional Examination Survey would be 11 ng/dL (0.11 \u00b5g/L) with a limit of detection is 0.1 40 ng/dL (0.001 \u00b5g/L) in children ages 3 -11 from 2013 -1430; and 41 42 Whereas, In 2006, the EPA announced a Product Stewardship agreement with 8 global 43 manufacturing companies who pledged to reduce PFOA emissions and product content by 95% 44 Resolution 02 (A-19) Page 3 of 9 in 2010 and work towards its elimination by 2015, and as of February 2017 all participating 1 companies state they met the PFOA Stewardship Program goals31,32; and 2 3 Whereas, The European Union has phased out contamination from PFAS by severely limiting 4 the use of PFAS and PFAS derivatives in manufacturing via the REACH Regulation33; and 5 6 Whereas, E xisting AMA policy addresses water contamination by lead ( -60.918, chlorine (H-135.956) , but does not address 8 contamination of drinking water by PFAS chem icals specifically; and 9 10 Whereas, Blood screening for water contamination is supported by H60.924, but no similar 11 policy exists for PF AS; therefore be it 12 13 RESOLVED, That o ur AMA call on the Environmental Protection Agency and the United States 14 government, with all due urgency, to 1.) establish national enforceable maximum contaminant 15 levels (MCL) for Per - and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in natio nal primary drinking water 16 and 2.) support legislation regarding the mitigation and regulation of P er- and Polyfluoroalkyl 17 Substances in drinking w ater; and be it further 18 19 RESOLVED, That our AMA call on the United States Government to establish national goals to 20 1.) ensure that there is blood level screening set at the 95th percentile based on the N ational 21 Health and Nutrition Examination S urveys and 2.) eliminate Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances 22 exposures to pregnant w omen and children; and be it further 23 24 RESOLVED, That o ur AMA call on the Environmental Protection Agency to 1.) officially classify 25 Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl by its carcinogenicity within their Integrated Risk Information System 26 (IRIS) electronic database and 2.) regulate manufacturers to limit the use of Per- and 27 Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and derivatives in all applications. 28 29 Fiscal Note: Significant, 12 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Safe Drinking Water H -135.928 Our AMA supports updates to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Lead and Copper Rule as well as other state and federal laws to eliminate exposure to lead through drinking water by: (1) Removing, in a timely manner, lead service lines and other leaded plumbing materials that come into contact with drinking water; (2) Requiring public water systems to establish a mechanism for consumers to access information on lead service line locations; (3) Informing consumers about the health -risks of partial lead service line replacement; (4) Requiring the inclusion of schools, lic ensed daycare, and health care settings among the sites routinely tested by municipal water quality assurance systems; (5) Creating and implementing standardized protocols and regulations pertaining to water quality testing, reporting and remediation to en sure the safety of water in schools and child care centers; (6) Improving public access to testing data on water lead levels by requiring testing results from public water systems to be posted on a publicly available website in a reasonable timeframe there by allowing consumers to take precautions to protect their health; (7) Establishing more robust and frequent public education efforts and outreach to consumers that have lead service lines, inc luding vulnerable populations; Resolution 02 (A-19) Page 6 of 9 (8) Requiring public water syste ms to notify public health agencies and health care providers when local water samples test above the action level for lead; (9) Seeking to shorten and streamline the compliance deadline requirements in the Safe Drinking Water Act; and (10) Actively pursuing changes to the federal lead and copper rules consistent with this policy. Chemical Analysis Report of Public and Commercial Water D -440.999 Our AMA: (1) requests the appropriate federal agency to require analysis and appropriate labeling of the chemical content, including fluoride, of commercially bottled water, as well as of the water supplies of cities or towns; (2) urges the FDA to require that annual water quality reports from bottled water manufacturers be publicly accessible in a readily av ailable format; and (3) urges the FDA to evaluate bottled water for changes in quality after typical storage conditions. Lead Contamination in Municipal Water Systems as Exemplified by Flint, Michigan H - 60.918 1. Our AMA will advocate for biologic (including hematological) and neurodevelopmental monitoring at established intervals for children exposed to lead contaminated water with resulting elevated blood lead levels (EBLL) so that they do not suffer delay in diagnosis of adverse consequences of t heir lead exposure. 2. Our AMA will urge existing federal and state -funded programs to evaluate at -risk children to expand services to provide automatic entry into early -intervention screening programs to assist in the neurodevelopmental monitoring of expo sed children with EBLL. 3. Our AMA will advocate for appropriate nutritional support for all people exposed to lead contaminated water with resulting elevated blood lead levels, but especially exposed pregnant women, lactating mothers and exposed children. Support should include Vitamin C, green leafy vegetables and other calcium resources so that their bodies will not be forced to substitute lead for missing calcium as the children grow. 4. Our AMA promotes screening, diagnosis and acceptable treatment of lead exposure and iron deficiency in all people exposed to lead contaminated water. The Health Risks of Hydraulic Fracturing H -135.931 1. Our AMA encourages appropriate agencies and organizations to study the potential human and environmental health risk s and impacts of hydraulic fracturing. 2. Our AMA: (A) supports the full disclosure of chemicals placed into the natural environment during the petroleum, oil and natural gas exploration and extraction process; and (B) supports the requirement that governm ent agencies record and monitor the chemicals placed into the natural environment for petroleum oil and natural gas extraction and the chemicals found in flowback fluids, to monitor for human exposures in well water and surface water, and to share this inf ormation with physicians and the public. 3. Our AMA supports research on the implementation of buffer zones or well set -backs between oil and gas development sites and residences, schools, hospitals, and religious institutions, to determine the distance ne cessary to ensure public health and safety. Contamination of Drinking Water by Pharmaceuticals and Personal Care Products D - 135.993 Our AMA supports the EPA and other federal agencies in engaging relevant stakeholders, which may include, but is not limit ed to the AMA, pharmaceutical companies, pharmaceutical retailers, state and specialty societies, and public health organizations in the development of Resolution 02 (A-19) Page 7 of 9 guidelines for physicians and the public for the proper disposal of pharmaceuticals and personal care pr oducts to prevent contamination of drinking water systems. Reducing Lead Poisoning H -60.924 1. Our AMA: (a) supports regulations and policies designed to protect young children from exposure to lead; (b) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Preventi on to give priority to examining the current weight of scientific evidence regarding the range of adverse health effects associated with blood lead concentrations below the current \"level of concern\" in order to provide appropriate guidance for physicians and public health policy, and encourage the identification of exposure pathways for children who have low blood lead concentrations, as well as effective and innovative strategies to reduce overall childhood lead exposure; (c) encourages physicians and pub lic health departments to screen children based on current recommendations and guidelines and to report all children with elevated blood levels to the appropriate health department in their state or community in order to fully assess the burden of lead exp osure in children. In some cases this will be done by the physician, and in other communities by the laboratories; (d) promotes community awareness of the hazard of lead -based paints; and (e) urges paint removal product manufacturers to print precautions a bout the removal of lead paint to be included with their products where and when sold. 2. Our AMA will call on the United States government to establish national goals to: (a) ensure that no child has a blood lead level >5 \u00b5g/dL (>50 ppb) by 2021, and (b) eliminate lead exposures to pregnant women and children, so that by 2030, no child would have a blood lead level >1 \u00b5g/dL (10 ppb). 3. Our AMA will call on the United States government in all its agencies to pursue the following strategies to achieve these goals: (a) adopt health -based standards and action levels for lead that rely on the most up -to-date scientific knowledge to prevent and reduce human exposure to lead, and assure prompt implementation of the strongest available measures to protect pregnant women and children from lead toxicity and neurodevelopmental impairment; (b) identify and remediate current and potential new sources of lead exposure (in dust, air, soil, water and consumer products) to protect children before they are exposed; (c) conti nue targeted screening of children to identify those who already have elevated blood lead levels for case management, as well as educational and other services; (d) eliminate new sources of lead introduced or released into the environment, which may entail banning or phasing out all remaining uses of lead in products (aviation gas, cosmetics, wheel weights, industrial paints, batteries, lubricants, and other sources), and the export of products containing lead, and setting more protective limits on emission s from battery recyclers and other sources of lead emissions; (e) provide a dedicated funding stream to enhance the resources available to identify and eliminate sources of lead exposure, and provide educational, social and clinical services to mitigate th e harms of lead toxicity, particularly to protect and improve the lives of children in communities that are disproportionately exposed to lead; and (f) establish an independent expert advisory committee to develop a long -term national strategy, including r ecommendations for funding and implementation, to achieve the national goal of eliminating lead toxicity in pregnant women and children, defined as blood lead levels above 1 \u00b5g/dL (10 ppb). 4. Our AMA supports requiring an environmental assessment of dwel lings, residential buildings, or child care facilities following the notification that a child occupant or frequent inhabitant has a confirmed elevated blood lead level, to determine the potential source of lead poisoning, including testing the water suppl y. Expansion of Hazardous Waste Landfills Over Aquifers H -135.943 (1) recognizes that the expansion of hazardous waste landfills or the construction of new hazardous waste landfills over principal aquifers represents a poten tial health risk for the publi c Resolution 02 (A-19) Page 8 of 9 water supply and is inconsistent with sound principles of public health policy, and therefore should be opposed; (2) will advocate for the continued monitoring of groundwater sources, including principal aquifers, that may be contaminated by hazardous waste landfill or other landfill leachate; and (3) supports efforts to improve hazardous waste treatment, recycling, and disposal methods in order to reduce the public health burden. Human and Environmental health impacts of chlorinated chemicals H -135.956 (1) Our AMA encourages the Environmental Protection Agency to base its evaluations of the potential public health and environmental risks posed by exposure to an individual chlorinated organic compound, other industrial compound, or manufacturing process on reliable data specific to that compound or process; (2) encourages the chemical industry to increase knowledge of the environmental behavior, bioaccumulation potential, and toxicology of their products and by -products; and (3) supports the implementation of risk reduction practices by the chemical and manufacturing industries. EPA and Green House Gas Regulation H-134.934 1. Our AMA supports the Environmental Protection Agency's authority to promulgate rules to regulate and control green house gas emissions in the United States. 2. Our AMA: (a) strongly supports evidence -based environmental statutes and regulation s intended to regulate air and water pollution and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; and (b) will advocate that environmental health regulations should only be modified or rescinded with scientific justification. Guidance for Worldwide Conservation of Po table Water H -135.947 Our AMA favors scientific and cultural development of a plan for worldwide potable water conservation, especially in countries affected by natural disasters or other events that disrupt the potable water supply. 440.057MSS Improving Detection, Awareness, and Prevention of Lead Contamination in Water: (1) Our AMA -MSS supports future research to improve water sampling techniques and protocols to better detect human exposure to lead at the point of consumption; (2) Our AMA -MSS supports improved open public access to testing data on health hazardous substance levels in public commodities, such as water; and (3) Our AMA -MSS supports legislation and efforts to reduce or eliminate lead from public and private water infrastructure 135.002MS S Environmental Protection: AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to support strong federal enforcement of environmental protection regulations. 150.013MSS Mercury in Food as a Human Health Hazard: (1) AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to (a) encourage that testing of mercu ry content in food, including fish, be continued by appropriate agencies, and laboratory reporting of results of mercury testing be updated and consistent with current Environmental Protection Agency and National Academy of Sciences standards; (b) encourag e the Food and Drug Administration to determine the most appropriate means of testing and labeling of all foods, including fish, Resolution 02 (A-19) Page 9 of 9 determine mercury content; and (c) encourage that the results and advisories of any mercury testing of fish should be readily a vailable where fish are sold, including labeling of packaged/canned fish. (2) AMA -MSS supports the AMA encouraging physicians to educate their patients about the potential dangers of mercury toxicity in some food and fish products, especially those that a re well documented to contain mercury, and to advise pregnant women to limit and parents to limit their children's consumption of such products. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 03 (A-19) Introduced by: Tristan Mackey, Haritha Pavuluri , and Rachel Michelle Shugart, University of South Carolina School of Medicine Greenville, SC; Anuradha Kanaparthi and Rachana Raghupathy, Northeast Ohio Clinic School of Medicine Subject: Amending H-490.913, Smoke -Free Environments and Workplaces, and H - 490.907, Tobacco Smoke Exposure of Children in Multi -Unit Housing , to include e -cigarettes Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Va zquez, Chair) Whereas, T he use of e -cigarettes, otherwise known as vaping, has become increasingly popular 1 for nicotine usage among youth, new smokers , and those seeking smoking cessation options1,2; 2 and 3 4 Whereas, A mong middle school students, current e -cigarette use increased by 48% during 5 2017 -20183; and 6 7 Whereas, A mong high school students, current e -cigarette use increased from 1.5% in 2011 to 8 20.8% in 20183; and 9 10 Whereas, In 2018, more than 3.6 million U.S. youth, including 1 in 5 high school students and 1 11 in 20 middle school students currently used e -cigarettes, resulting in a different population 12 exposed to the toxic effects of secondhand smoke due to e -cigarette use than due to cigarette 13 use3; and 14 15 Wherea s, College students who use e lectronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) are more than 16 twice as likely to initiate cigarette use4; and 17 18 Whereas, During an assessment of indoor air quality at an e -cigarette (vaping) convention, it 19 was found that e -cigarette use was a major source of particulate matter, air nicotine, and real - 20 time total volatile organic compounds, impairing indoor air quality5; and 21 22 Wherea s, E-cigarette use indoors increased particulate matter concentrations 160 -fold at 0.5m 23 and 103 -fold at 1m, showing that particulate matter increases as proximity to the e -cigarette 24 increases6; and 25 26 Whereas, W hen characterizing nicotine persistence on surf aces over a 72 -hr period, residual 27 nicotine concentrations persisted on both terry cloth and glass surfaces for 72 hours, and was 28 found to persist long enough to pose a potential third hand nicotine exposure risk7; and 29 Next Table of Contents Previous Resolution 03 (A-19) Page 2 of 11 Whereas, I t has been shown that vaping worsens indoor air quality by increasing the 30 concentration of nicotine, particulate matter, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and aluminum -- 31 all substances associated with increased risk for lung and cardiovascular disease and cancer8; 32 and 33 34 Whereas, Oxidants and reactive oxygen species reactivity in e -cigarette aerosols was similar to 35 that in traditional cigarette smoke, with copper levels being found at much higher levels in e - 36 cigarettes9; and 37 38 Whereas, A systematic review found that e -cigarette vap or may lead to adverse health effects , 39 such as an increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases and certain cancers10,11; 40 and 41 42 Whereas, T hese adverse h ealth effects may extend to non -users due to secondhand vapor 43 exposure , especially those who are pregnant or children11,12; and 44 45 Whereas, Nicotine exposure during adolescence can harm the developing brain, impacting 46 learning, memory, and attention as well as increasing risk for future addiction to other drugs2; 47 and 48 49 Whereas, S moke -free policies w ere designed to protect non -smokers from toxic irritants, 50 incentivize smoking cessation, and denormali ze smoking13; and 51 52 Whereas, T he use of e -cigarettes where smoke -free policies are implemented increases 53 exposure risk to non -user bystanders, reduces cessation initiatives, and may promote the 54 renormalization of smoking13; and 55 56 Whereas, Users who were not able to vape indoors would use less frequently and were less 57 dependent on e -cigarettes14; and 58 59 Whereas, 26.1% (n=1034) of users reported not being able to vape in places where smoking is 60 typically banned , while 73.9% (n=2926) reported being able vape in places where smoking is 61 typically banned14; and 62 63 Whereas, 15 states and 814 municipalities have currently prohibited the use of e -cigarettes in 64 the same places where cigarette smoking is prohibited, which means that approximately 70% of 65 states remain unprotected15,16; and 66 67 Whereas, O ur AM A recognizes the use of e -cigarettes and vaping as an urgent public health 68 epidemic and is actively working to counteract the marketing and use of addictive e -cigarette 69 and vaping devices (AMA policy H -495.986); therefore, be it 70 71 RESOLVED, T hat our AMA amend polic ies H-490.913, Smoke -Free Environments and 72 Workplaces, and H -490.907, Tobacco Smoke Exposure of Children in Multi -Unit Housing, to 73 include e -cigarettes and vaping by insertion and deletion as follows: 74 Resolution 03 (A-19) Page 3 of 11 Smoke -Free and Vape -Free Environme nts and Workplaces, H-490.913 75 On the issue of the health effects of environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and 76 passive smoke and vape exposure in the workplace and other public facilities, 77 our AMA: 78 79 (1) (a) supports classification of ETS as a known human carcin ogen;

(MSS Res 1, A -14) AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 04 (A-19) Introduced by: Region 3 Subject: Support for the Use of Psychiatric Advance Directives Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , Nearly 10 million US adults live with serious mental illness, defined as a mental 1 illness that \"result[s] in serious functional impairment\" and \"interferes with one or more major life 2 activities\"1-2; and 3 4 Whereas, A survey of 213 p atients who previously received coercive psychiatric treatment found 5 that they would like to engage in advance plannin g to determine their preferences for future care 6 during psychiatric crises3; and 7 8 Whereas, A psychiatric advance directive is a legal document written by a competent individual 9 with a mental illness, specifying their treatment preferences and/or granting t heir medical power 10 of attorney to a surrogate during a future psychiatric crisis that impairs the individual's capacity4-11 6; and 12 13 Whereas, A psychiatric advance directive differs from generic advance directives due to the 14 unique nature of psychiatric illnes s and treatment5-7; and 15 16 Whereas, While m ost states enable psychiatric advance directive creation under broader 17 advance directive statues , only 25 states have legislation pertaining specifically to the use of 18 psychiatric advance directives4-6; and 19 20 Whereas, In Nevada and New Hampshire, while a patient may designate an agent to make 21 healthcare decisions for them should they become incompetent, they may only specify in writing 22 advance instructions on non -psychiatric life -sustaining care4-6 ; and 23 24 Where as, The Patient Self -Determination Act of 1990 states that Medicare and Medicaid 25 patients should be advised on opportunities to specify treatment preferences prior to the loss of 26 decision -making capacity when possible8; and 27 28 Whereas, The Centers for Medic are & Medicaid Services Inpatient Psychiatric Facility Quality 29 Reporting Program Manual specifies that a \"patient should be allowed the opportunity to appoint 30 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 04 (A-19) Page 2 of 9 a surrogate decision maker or complete non -psychiatric and psychiatric advance directives\"9; 1 and 2 3 Whereas, The use of psychiatric advance directives can help improve patient autonomy, 4 treatment adherence, and the physician -patient relationship and reduce the need for coercive 5 interventions such as involuntary commitment, seclusion, restraints, police transport, and 6 involuntary medications10-12; and 7 8 Whereas, In the first 6 months following psychiatric advance directive completion, 6.5 percent of 9 patients experienced a coherence crisis intervention compared to 19.7 percent of non - 10 completers10; and 11 12 Wher eas, Patients with serious mental illness who participated in a facilitated psychiatric 13 advance directive completion session were 1.57 times more likely to experience an increase in 14 working alliance between themselves and clinicians after 1 month compared to patients who did 15 not experience the session11; and 16 17 Whereas, Psychiatric advance directive completers were 7.8 times more likely to be adherent to 18 their psychiatric mediation after 1 years compared to non -completers12; and 19 20 Whereas, In the largest study of psychiatric advance directive usage to date, in over 1,000 21 patients with mental illness, only 7 percent of respondents had completed a psychiatric AD or 22 designated a surrogate for future psychiatric crises, while 68 percent of respondents expresse d 23 interest in completing one13; and 24 25 Whereas, A survey of over 400 psychiatrists and psychologists showed that only 37 percent of 26 respondents demonstrated sufficient legal knowledge regarding psychiatric advance 27 directives14; and 28 29 Whereas, The use of facil itated psychiatric advance directive, an intervention in which a 30 psychiatric advance directive is completed by a patient with the assistance of a trained 31 individual, can reduce most barriers to psychiatric advance directive completion10,15; and 32 33 Whereas, L ow usage of psychiatric advance directive has led several states and organizations 34 to take steps to increase awareness and utilization of psychiatric advance directives, such as 35 establishing psychiatric advance directive completion clinics16-19; and 36 37 Where as, Existing AMA policy \"encourage[es] the use of advance directives and health care 38 powers of attorney\" ( H-140.845, Encouraging the Use of Advance Directives and Health Care 39 Powers of Attorney), \"educating physicians about advance care planning\" ( H-85.956 , Educating 40 Physicians About Advance Care Planning), and \"promotes awareness and understanding of\" 41 advance care planning in the unique situation of pregnancy ( H-85.952, Advance Directives 42 During Pregnancy) ; and 43 44 Resolution 04 (A-19) Page 3 of 9 Whereas, As with pregnant women, individua ls with serious mental illness constitute a special 1 population with unique considerations that warrants additional attention in the area of advance 2 directive usage3-6; therefore be it 3 4 RESOLVED, That our AMA will support efforts to increase awareness and appropriate utilization 5 of psychiatric advance directives; and be it further 6 7 RESOLVED, That our AMA will support the education of medical students and residents on 8 psychiatric advance directives. 9 10 Fiscal Note: Moderate, 9 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

Res 116, A -12; Reaff: A -15 E-5.1 Advance Care Planning The process of advance care planning is wid ely recognized as a way to support patient self - determination, facilitate decision making, and promote better care at the end of life. Although often thought of primarily for terminally ill patients or those with chronic medical conditions, advance care p lanning is valuable for everyone, regardless of age or current health status. Planning in advance for decisions about care in the event of a life -threatening illness or injury gives individuals the opportunity to reflect on and express the values they want to have govern their care, to articulate the factors that are important to them for quality of life, and to make clear any preferences they have with respect to specific interventions. Importantly, these discussions also give individuals the opportunity t o identify who they would want to make decisions for them should they not have decision -making capacity. Proactively discussing with patients what they would or would not want if recovery from illness or injury is improbable also gives physicians opportu nity to address patients' concerns and expectations and clarify misunderstandings individuals may have about specific medical conditions or interventions. Encouraging patients to share their views with their families or other intimates and record them in a dvance directives, and to name a surrogate decision maker, helps to ensure that patients' own values, goals, and preferences will inform care decisions even when they cannot speak for themselves. Physicians must recognize, however that patients and famili es approach decision making in many different ways, informed by culture, faith traditions, and life experience, and should be sensitive to each patient's individual situations and preferences when broaching discussion of planning for care at the end of lif e. Physicians should routinely engage their patients in advance care planning in keeping with the following guidelines: (a) Regularly encourage all patients, regardless of age or health status, to: (i) think about their values and perspectives on quality of life and articulate what goals they would have for care if they faced a life -threatening illness or injury, including any preferences they may have about specific medical interventions (such as pain management, medically administered nutrition a nd hydration, mechanical ventilation, use of antibiotics, dialysis, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation); (ii) identify someone they would want to have make decisions on their behalf if they did not have decision -making capacity; (iii) make their views know n to their designated surrogate and to (other) family members or intimates. (b) Be prepared to answer questions about advance care planning, to help patients formulate their views, and to help them articulate their preferences for care (including their wi shes regarding time -limited trials of interventions and surrogate decision maker). Physicians should also be prepared to refer patients to additional resources for further information and guidance if appropriate. Resolution 04 (A-19) Page 7 of 9 (c) Explain how advance directives, as wri tten articulations of patients' preferences, are used as tools to help guide treatment decisions in collaboration with patients themselves when they have decision -making capacity, or with surrogates when they do not, and explain the surrogate's responsibil ities in decision making. Involve the patient's surrogate in this conversation whenever possible. (d) Incorporate notes from the advance care planning discussion into the medical record. Patient values, preferences for treatment, and designation of surrog ate decision maker should be included in the notes to be used as guidance when the patient is unable to express his or her own decisions. If the patient has an advance directive document or written designation of proxy, include a copy (or note the existenc e of the directive) in the medical record and encourage the patient to give a copy to his or her surrogate and others to help ensure it will be available when needed. (e) Periodically review with the patient his or her goals, preferences, and chosen decis ion maker, which often change over time or with changes in health status. Update the patient's medical records accordingly when preferences have changed to ensure that these continue to reflect the individual's current wishes. If applicable, assist the pat ient with updating his or her advance directive or designation of proxy forms. Involve the patient's surrogate in these reviews whenever possible. AMA Principles of Medical Ethics I, IV; Issued: 2016; Mod: 2017. E-5.2 Advance Directives Respect for autono my and fidelity to the patient are widely acknowledged as core values in the professional ethics of medicine. For patients who lack decision -making capacity, these values are fulfilled through third -party decision making and the use of advance directives. Advance directives also support continuity of care for patients when they transition across care settings, physicians, or health care teams. Advance directives, whether oral or written, advisory or a formal statutory document, are tools that give patients of all ages and health status the opportunity to express their values, goals for care, and treatment preferences to guide future decisions about health care. Advance directives also allow patients to identify whom they want to make decisions on their beha lf when they cannot do so themselves. They enable physicians and surrogates to make good -faith efforts to respect the patient's goals and implement the patient's preferences when the patient does not have decision -making capacity. An advance directive nev er takes precedence over the contemporaneous wishes of a patient who has decision -making capacity. In emergency situations when a patient is not able to participate in treatment decisions and there is no surrogate or advance directive available to guide d ecisions, physicians should provide medically appropriate interventions when urgently needed to meet the patient's immediate clinical needs. Interventions may be withdrawn at a later time in keeping with the patient's preferences when they become known and in accordance with ethics guidance for withdrawing treatment. Before initiating or continuing treatment, including, but not limited to, life -sustaining interventions, the physician should: (a) Assess the patient's decision -making capacity in the current clinical circumstances. Resolution 04 (A-19) Page 8 of 9 (b) Ascertain whether the patient has an advance directive and if so, whether it accurately reflects his/her current values and preferences. Determine whether the patient's current clinical circumstances meet relevant thresholds s et out in the directive. (c) Ascertain whether the patient has named a health care proxy (e.g., orally or through a formal legal document). If the patient has not, ask who the patient would want to have make decisions should he or she become unable to do so. (d) Document the conversation, including the patient's goals for care, and specific preferences regarding interventions and surrogate decision maker, in the medical record; incorporate any written directives (as available) into the medical record to e nsure they are accessible to the health care team. (e) When treatment decisions must be made by the patient's surrogate, help the surrogate understand how to carry out the patient's wishes in keeping with the advance directive (when available), including whether the directive applies in the patient's current clinical circumstances and what medically appropriate interventions are available to achieve the patient's goals for care. When conflicts arise between the advance directive and the wishes of the pati ent's surrogate, the attending physician should seek assistance from an ethics committee or other appropriate institutional resource. (f) When a patient who lacks decision -making capacity has no advance directive and there is no surrogate available and w illing to make treatment decisions on the patient's behalf, or no surrogate can be identified, the attending physician should seek assistance from an ethics committee or other appropriate resource in ascertaining the patient's best interest. (g) Document physician orders to implement treatment decisions in the medical record, including both orders for specific, ongoing interventions (e.g., palliative interventions) and orders to forgo specific interventions (e.g., orders not to attempt resuscitation, not t o intubate, not to provide antibiotics or dialysis).

MSS Res 15, I -15 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 05 (A-19) Introduced by: Region 5, Krista Allen, Landin, Rocky Vista University; Natash a McGlaun, University of Nevada Reno School of Medicine; Ellena Popova, University of Pennsylvania; Ian Maynor, University of California San Francisco Subject: Improving the Health and Safety of Consensual Sex Workers Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , The World Health Organization, UNFPA, UNAIDS, the Global Network of Sex Work 1 Projects, Amnesty International , and Human Rights Watch all recommend decriminalization of 2 consensual sex work to improve access to health care for high risk populations, with the WHO 3 specifying that decriminalization would help reduce HIV incidence1-3; and 4 5 Whereas, Sex work is currently legal in the United Kingdom, Australia, Belgium, Argentina, 6 Denmark, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain, Switzerland, Singapore, and the US 7 state of Nevada4-11; and 8 9 Whereas, Legalization of sex work bestow s official legal status on the practice of prostitution, 10 allowing more regulatory control than mere decriminalization12; and 11 12 Whereas, Studies in Australia found statistically significant decreases in HIV and STI rates and 13 statistically significant increases in condom use with decriminalization13-15; and 14 15 Whereas, An Australian study revealed 50% of illegal sex workers were offered more mon ey to 16 have sex without a condom compared to 13% of legal sex workers , and 52% of illegal sex 17 workers had been raped by a client in the past year compared to 9% of legal sex workers16; 18 and 19 20 Whereas, In a study on the mental health of legal and illegal sex workers, illegal sex workers 21 were four times more likely to report mental health issues , possibly due to increased risks that 22 come with illegal sex work such as assault and arrest16; and 23 24 Whereas, In countries where sex work is criminalized, sex workers are less likely to seek 25 treatment if they get infected with an STI and less likely to disclose their profession to a 26 physician leading to decreased education and testing17,18; and 27 28 Whereas, Because sex work is illegal in the United States , many sex workers struggle to obtain 29 health insurance, leading to the majority being uninsured and paying out of pocket for healthcare18; 30 and 31 Whereas, A systematic review of the literature estimates that 15 -20% of men in the United 32 States have paid for sex at least once19; and 33 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 05 (A-19) Page 2 of 8 1 Whereas, Following the brief decriminalization of prostitution in Rhode Island in 2003, 2 gonorrhea rates declined by 39%, not only for sex workers, but for the general population20; and 3 4 Whereas, In 2016, 33,309 people, many of whom are parents, were arrested for prostitution and 5 commercial vices in the United States , putting their children at an increased risk for depression, 6 anxiety, antisocial behavior, drug use, and cognitive delays21,22; and 7 8 Whereas, A recent systematic review found lifetime prevalence of workplace -based violence 9 among sex workers to be 45 -75%, and a recent study of sex workers in Chicago who had a 10 pimp found that over half of them had experienced violence as coercion with increasing levels of 11 violence since original recruitment23; and 12 13 Whereas, A study of sex workers in New York City showed 27% had exp erienced violence and 14 17% reported sexual harassme nt, including rape, from police and interactions with the police 15 are commonplace because sex work is illegal24,25; and 16 17 Whereas, The threat of potential arrest forces sex workers to move their business into sparsely - 18 populated and poorly -patrolled areas such as rural or industrial settin gs, where pimps and 19 clients can perpetrate violence with impunity26; and 20 21 Whereas, The legalization of prostitution in the state of Nevada shows that legalization of sex 22 work reduces violence against sex workers, violence in the community and rates of sexu ally 23 transmitted diseases27; and 24 25 Whereas, In a nationwide study 12% of trans women reported earning income through sex 26 work, with higher rates among trans women of color, and 77% of these women reported intimate 27 partner violence, 72% reported sexual assault, and 86% reported police harassment28; and 28 29 Whereas Legalization of sex work could allow for sex worker union formation, a measure shown 30 to decrease income inequality, improve working conditions, and better the health of union and 31 non-union members, as was the case with the formation of the Exotic Dancers Union in 199329-32 31; and 33 34 Whereas, The 2018 Fi ght Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) prohibits solicitation of illegal, 35 consensual sex work online, despite internet -vetted sex work causing lower rates of STIs, less 36 reliance on exploitative pimps, and less violence by dangerous clients32,33; and 37 38 Whereas, A meta -analysis of 134 studies across 13 countries found that repressive policing of 39 sex workers, their clients , and sex work venues deprioritized the safety, health , and rights of sex 40 workers and hinders their access to due process of the law2; therefore be it 41 42 RESOLVED, That our AMA recognize the adverse health outcomes of criminalizing consensual 43 sex work ; and be it further 44 45 RESOLVED That our AMA support legislation that advances the sex work industry towards 46 decriminalization and legalization 47 48 49 Resolution 05 (A-19) Page 3 of 8 Fiscal Note: Significant, 11 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

Improving Medical Practice and Patient/Family Education to Reverse the Epidemic of Nonmedical Prescription Drug Use and Addiction D -95.981 1. Our AMA: a. will collaborate wit h relevant medical specialty societies to develop continuing medical education curricula aimed at reducing the epidemic of misuse of and addiction to prescription controlled substances, especially by youth; b. encourages medical specialty societies to de velop practice guidelines and performance measures that would increase the likelihood of safe and effective clinical use of prescription controlled substances, especially psychostimulants, benzodiazepines and benzodiazepines receptor agonists, and opioid a nalgesics; c. encourages physicians to become aware of resources on the nonmedical use of prescription controlled substances that can assist in actively engaging patients, and especially parents, on the benefits and risks of such treatment, and the need to safeguard and monitor prescriptions for controlled substances, with the intent of reducing access and diversion by family members and friends; d. will consult with relevant agencies on potential strategies to actively involve physicians in being a par t of the solution to the epidemic of unauthorized/nonmedical use of prescription controlled substances; and e. supports research on: (i) firmly identifying sources of diverted prescription controlled substances so that solutions can be advanced; and (ii) issues relevant to the long -term use of prescription controlled substances. 2. Our AMA, in conjunction with other Federation members, key public and private stakeholders, and pharmaceutical manufacturers, will pursue and intensify collaborative efforts in volving a public health approach in order to: a. reduce harm from the inappropriate use, misuse and diversion of controlled substances, including opioid analgesics and other potentially addictive medications; b. increase awareness that substance use dis orders are chronic diseases and must be treated accordingly; and Resolution 06 (A-19) Page 4 of 6 c. reduce the stigma associated with patients suffering from persistent pain and/or substance use disorders, including addiction. Medicaid Substance Use Disorder Coverage H -290.962 1. Our AMA will advocate that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services provide expanded Medicaid payment coverage for the medical management and treatment of all substance use disorders. 2. Our AMA will advocate for clear billing and coding processes rega rding the medical management and treatment of all substance use disorders. 3. Our AMA recognizes the expertise of addiction specialist physicians and the importance of improving access to management and treatment of addiction services with Medicaid paymen t for all physician specialties. Modernizing Privacy Regulations for Addiction Treatment Records H -315.965 Our AMA supports: (1) regulatory and legislative changes that better balance patients' privacy protections against the need for health professional s to be able to offer appropriate medical services to patients with substance use disorders; (2) regulatory and legislative changes that enable physicians to fully collaborate with all clinicians involved in providing health care services to patients with substance use disorders; and (3) continued protections against the unauthorized disclosure of substance use disorder treatment records outside the healthcare system. Support the Elimination of Barriers to Medication -Assisted Treatment for Substance Use Disorder D -95.968 Our AMA will: (1) advocate for legislation that eliminates barriers to, increases funding for, and requires access to all appropriate FDA -approved medications or therapies used by licensed drug treatment clinics or facilities; and (2) de velop a public awareness campaign to increase awareness that medical treatment of substance use disorder with medication -assisted treatment is a first -line treatment for this chronic medical disease. Substance Use Disorders During Pregnancy H -420.950 Our AMA will: (1) oppose any efforts to imply that the diagnosis of substance abuse disorder during pregnancy represents child abuse; and (2) support legislative and other appropriate efforts for the expansion and improved access to evidence -based treatment f or substance use disorders during pregnancy. Resolution 06 (A-19) Page 5 of 6 Survey of Addiction Treatment Centers' Availability H -95.926 Our AMA: (1) encourages the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to use its national surveys to increase the informat ion available on the type of insurance (e.g., Medicaid, Medicare, private insurance) accepted by substance use disorder treatment programs listed in SAMHSA's \"treatment locators\"; (2) encourages physicians who are authorized to provide medication assisted treatment to opt in to be listed publicly in SAMHSA's \"treatment locators\"; and (3) encourages SAMHSA to include private and group practice physicians in its online treatment locator for addiction treatment facilities. Role of Self -Help in Addiction Treat ment H -95.951 The AMA: (1) recognizes that (a) patients in need of treatment for alcohol or other substance use disorders should be treated for these medical conditions by qualified professionals in a manner consonant with accepted practice guidelines and patient placement criteria; and (b) self - help groups are valuable resources for many patients and their families and should be utilized by physicians as adjuncts to a treatment plan; and (2) urges managed care organizations and insurers to consider self -help as a complement to, not a substitute for, treatment directed by professionals, and to refrain from using their patient's involvement in self -help activities as a basis for denying authorization for payment for professional treatment of patients and the ir families who need such care. Federal Drug Policy in the United States H -95.981 The AMA, in an effort to reduce personal and public health risks of drug abuse, urges the formulation of a comprehensive national policy on drug abuse, specifically advising that the federal government and the nation should: (1) acknowledge that federal ef forts to address illicit drug use via supply reduction and enforcement have been ineffective (2) expand the availability and reduce the cost of treatment programs for substance use disorders, including addiction; (3) lead a coordinated approach to adolesce nt drug education; (4) develop community -based prevention programs for youth at risk; (5) continue to fund the Office of National Drug Control Policy to coordinate federal drug policy; (6) extend greater protection against discrimination in the employment and provision of services to drug abusers; (7) make a long -term commitment to expanded research and data collection; (8) broaden the focus of national and local policy from drug abuse to substance abuse; and (9) recognize the complexity of the problem of s ubstance abuse and oppose drug legalization. Perinatal Addiction - Issues in Care and Prevention H -420.962 Our AMA: (1) adopts the following statement: Transplacental drug transfer should not be subject to criminal sanctions or civil liability; (2) encou rages the federal government to expand the proportion of funds allocated to drug treatment, prevention, and education. In particular, support is crucial for establishing and making broadly available specialized treatment programs for drug - addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women wherever possible; (3) urges the federal government to fund additional research to further knowledge about and effective treatment programs for drug -addicted pregnant and breastfeeding women, encourages also the support of research that provides long -term follow -up data on the developmental consequences of perinatal drug exposure, and identifies appropriate methodologies for early intervention with perinatally exposed children; (4) reaffirms the following statement: Pregnant and bre astfeeding patients with substance use disorders should be provided with physician -led, team -based care that is evidence -based and offers the ancillary and supportive services that are necessary to support rehabilitation; and (5) through its communication vehicles, encourages all physicians to increase their knowledge regarding the effects of drug and alcohol use during pregnancy and breastfeeding and to routinely inquire about alcohol and drug use in the course of providing prenatal care. Promotion of Be tter Pain Care D -160.981 Resolution 06 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 1. Our AMA: (a) will express its strong commitment to better access and delivery of quality pain care through the promotion of enhanced research, education and clinical practice in the field of pain medicine; and (b) encourages re levant specialties to collaborate in studying the following: (i) the scope of practice and body of knowledge encompassed by the field of pain medicine; (ii) the adequacy of undergraduate, graduate and post graduate education in the principles and practice of the field of pain medicine, considering the current and anticipated medical need for the delivery of quality pain care; (iii) appropriate training and credentialing criteria for this multidisciplinary field of medical practice; and (iv) convening a meet ing of interested parties to review all pertinent matters scientific and socioeconomic. 2. Our AMA encourages relevant stakeholders to research the overall effects of opioid production cuts. 3. Our AMA strongly urges the US Drug Enforcement Administratio n to base any future reductions in aggregate production quotas for opioids on actual data from multiple sources, including prescribing data, and to proactively monitor opioid quotas and supply to prevent any shortages that might develop and to take immedia te action to correct any shortages. 4. Our AMA encourages the US Drug Enforcement Administration to be more transparent when developing medication production guidelines. 5. Our AMA and the physician community reaffirm their commitment to delivering compa ssionate and ethical pain management, promoting safe opioid prescribing, reducing opioid -related harm and the diversion of controlled substances, improving access to treatment for substance use disorders, and fostering a public health based -approach to add ressing opioid - related morbidity and mortality. Community -Based Treatment Centers H -160.963 Our AMA supports the use of community -based treatment centers for substance abuse, emotional disorders and developmental disabilities. Naloxone Administration an d Heroin Overdose - 100.007MSS AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to: (1) recognize the great burden that both prescription and non - prescription opiate addiction and abuse places on patients and society alike and reaffirm its support for the compassionate treatment of patients with opiate addiction; (2) monitor the progress of nasal naloxone studies and report back as needed; and (3) work to remove obstacles to physicians who wish to conduct ethical and needed research in the area of addiction medicine.

and 3 4 Whereas, Lack of insurance is associated with higher mortality rates in adult and pediatric 5 population s2,3; and 6 7 Whereas, Uninsured Americans are more than twice as likely to not have access to needed 8 medical care and prescription medicines compared to those with private i nsuranc e4; and 9 10 Whereas, The majority of uninsured people are from low income families, and people of color 11 are at a higher risk of being uninsured than non -Hispanic white s5; and 12 13 Whereas, The high cost of insurance is the most commonly reported barrier to obtaining 14 insuranc e5; and 15 16 Whereas, 45% of U.S. adults between the ages of 19 and 64 identified as inadequately insured 17 in 2018, many of whom also reported delaying seeking care and/or struggling to pay medical 18 debt6; and 19 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 07 (A-19) Page 2 of 12 1 Whereas, The United States spen ds more than twice as much per capita on healthcare 2 compared to other high -income countries, yet continues to rank poorly among its peers in many 3 markers of health outcomes, including infant mortality and mortality amenable to health car e7,8; 4 and 5 6 Whereas, Single -payer systems have been found to perform better than multi -payer systems in 7 terms of health equity, risk pooling, and negotiation, while boasting lower administrative cost s9; 8 and 9 10 Whereas, The United States has worse health outcomes, including shorter life expectancy, 11 higher infant mortality, and greater prevalence of chronic disease compared to high -income 12 countries with a single -payer healthcare syste m10,11; and 13 14 Whereas, In a recent survey, 56% of physicians strongly or somewhat supported the creation of 15 a national single -payer health care progra m12; and 16 17 Whereas, The American Medical Student Association, the American Public Health Association, 18 National Nurses United, the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, the National 19 Medical Asso ciation, and the American Medical Women's Association support creation of a 20 universal, national health progra m13-18; and 21 22 Whereas, A 2018 survey found that 70.1% of Americans now favor Medicare for All polic y19; and 23 24 Whereas, Greater than 25.3% of total US hospital expenditures are administrative costs, which 25 is more than double that of countries with single payer systems such as Canada (12.42%) and 26 Scotland (11.59% )20; and 27 28 Whereas, The ACA operates with 22.5 percent ($273.6 billion) administrative overhea d costs 29 with nearly two -thirds of the total ACA overhead costs attributed to private insurance due to the 30 complexity of managing a competitive marketplace with numerous insurer s21; and 31 32 Whereas, It is estimated that for every 10 physicians providing care, almost 7 additional people 33 are required to be engaged in billing activities, and these billing -related expenses are 34 continuously growin g22,23; and 35 36 Whereas, In the United States, the multi -payer health insurance industry adds about $350 billion 37 annually in billing and administrative costs, which would be eliminated by a single payer 38 reform24; and 39 40 Whereas, Private insurance companies have significant variation in the amount they pay to 41 providers/facilities, resulting in considerable variation in spending and complexity in healthcare 42 administration, while public insurance providers (e.g. Medicare) have a uniform process 43 contributing to administrative simplicit y25; and 44 45 Whereas, Physicians' practices in the U.S. spend roughly 4 times per capita what Canadian 46 practices spend on interacting with payers, with U.S. expenditures in this area expected to rise 47 without interventio n26,27; and 48 49 Resolution 07 (A-19) Page 3 of 12 Whereas, Expansion of access to government -sponsored health insurance in Oregon led to 1 higher health care utilization, lower o ut-of-pocket medical expenses, lower medical debt, and 2 better self -reported physical and mental healt h28; and 3 4 Whereas, Expanding access to care in the US through the ACA and through analogous state - 5 level programs such as Massachusetts ' health care reform has not worsened hospital outcomes 6 such as ICU mortality and length of stay and has not increased wait times for primary care 7 visits29,30; and 8 9 Whereas, The instability of the ACA marketplace is due to a small risk pool and the increasing 10 premiums are due to adverse selection caused by deregulating the ACA marketplace with the 11 individual mandate repeal and less -expensive short -term plans, while a regulated single payer 12 policy that includes all taxpayers into the risk pool would prevent adverse selection, im prove 13 stability, and lower premium s31,32; and 14 15 Whereas, A single payer system would allow the government to effectively negotiate drug and 16 device prices for all consumers, a process currently in practice within the VA system and 17 Department of Defense, allo wing them to pay roughly half as much paid by retail pharmacie s33; 18 and 19 20 Whereas, While the AMA currently opposes a single payer solution because it may limit patient 21 choice of provider (H -165.888), current private health insurance companies limit patients to 22 particular provider network s34; and 23 24 Whereas, A national single payer system would protect the patient -physician relationship from 25 interference by third -party, for -profit health insurance companies, which have caused 26 innumerable obstructions to care, for example, frustrating prior authorization rules, which would 27 not be profit -driven under a national single -payer syste m35; and 28 29 Whereas, The AMA lobbied against health care reform during the Roosevelt administration, and 30 spread propaganda about proposals for single -payer health insurance during the Truman 31 administration and proposals for Medicare during the Kennedy and Johnson administration s36; 32 and 33 34 Whereas, The AMA collaborated with other special interest groups during the mid -2000s as part 35 of the Healt h Coverage Coalition for the Uninsured (HCCU) to shift the emerging campaign for 36 health care reform away from single -payer health insurance and toward the market -based 37 solutions that were implemented as part of the AC A37; and 38 39 Whereas, The AMA currently participates in the Partnership for America's Health Care Future, a 40 conglomerate of private insurance companies, private hospitals, and PhRMA that actively 41 advocates against a national single payer health syste m38; and 42 43 Whereas, The AMA -MSS currently suppo rts a variety of iteratively progressive solutions to 44 expand access to care and reduce costs for patients which are all less effective than a national 45 single payer system in delivering equitable and accessible health care to all Americans 46 (165.007MSS, 165. 011MSS); and 47 48 Whereas, The AMA -MSS supports universal healthcare, the expansion of healthcare coverage, 49 reform that achieves universal healthcare, and has asked that universal healthcare be \"the 50 Resolution 07 (A-19) Page 4 of 12 number one priority of the American Medical Association\" (165 .009MSS, 165.012MSS, 1 165.017MSS); and 2 3 Whereas, The AMA -MSS supports the implementation of a national single payer system 4 (165.020MSS) ; therefore be it 5 6 RESOLVED, That our AMA support the creation of a national single payer system to expand 7 access to care and reduce costs for patients, providers, and healthcare systems; and be it 8 further 9 10 RESOLVED, That our AMA delete policies H -165.838 -12 and H -165.844, and amend poli cy H- 11 165.888 as follows: 12 13 Evaluating Health System Reform Proposals H -165.888 14 1. Our AMA will continue its efforts to ensure that health system reform proposals 15 adhere to the following principles: 16 A. Physicians maintain primary ethical responsibility to advocate for their patients' 17 interests and needs. 18 B. Unfair concentration of market power of payers is detrimental to patients and 19 physicians, if patient freedom of choice or physician ability to select mode of practice 20 is limited or denied. Single -payer systems clearly fall within such a definition and, 21 consequently, should continue to be opposed by the AMA. Reform proposals should 22 balance fairly the market power between payers and physicians or be opposed. 23 CB. All health system reform proposals should include a valid estimate of 24 implementation cost, based on all health care expenditures to be included in the 25 reform; and supports the concept that all health system reform proposals should 26 identify specifically what means of funding (including emplo yer-mandated funding, 27 general taxation, payroll or value -added taxation) will be used to pay for the reform 28 proposal and what the impact will be. 29 DC. All physicians participating in managed care plans and medical delivery systems 30 must be able without thr eat of punitive action to comment on and present their 31 positions on the plan's policies and procedures for medical review, quality 32 assurance, grievance procedures, credentialing criteria, and other financial and 33 administrative matters, including physician representation on the governing board 34 and key committees of the plan. 35 ED. Any national legislation for health system reform should include sufficient and 36 continuing financial support for inner -city and rural hospitals, community health 37 centers, clinics, special programs for special populations and other essential public 38 health facilities that serve underserved populations that otherwise lack the financial 39 means to pay for their health care. 40 FE. Health system reform proposals and ultimate legislation sho uld result in 41 adequate resources to enable medical schools and residency programs to produce 42 an adequate supply and appropriate generalist/specialist mix of physicians to deliver 43 patient care in a reformed health care system. 44 GF. All civilian federal gove rnment employees, including Congress and the 45 Administration, should be covered by any health care delivery system passed by 46 Congress and signed by the President. 47 HG. True health reform is impossible without true tort reform. 48 Resolution 07 (A-19) Page 5 of 12 2. Our AMA supports health care reform that meets the needs of all Americans 1 including people with injuries, congenital or acquired disabilities, and chronic 2 conditions, and as such values function and its improvement as key outcomes to be 3 specifically included in national health ca re reform legislation. 4 3. Our AMA supports health care reform that meets the needs of all Americans 5 including people with mental illness and substance use / addiction disorders and will 6 advocate for the inclusion of full parity for the treatment of mental illness and 7 substance use / addiction disorders in all national health care reform legislation. 8 4. Our AMA supports health system reform alternatives that are consistent with AMA 9 principles of pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, and univer sal access 10 for patients. 11 12 ; and be it further 13 14 RESOLVED, That our AMA end its participation in the Partnership for America's Health Care 15 Future and any other coalitions that exist to oppose a national single -payer system. 16 17 Fiscal Note: Significant, 12 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Health System Reform Legislation H -165.838 1. Our American Medical Association is committed to working with Congress, the Administration, and other stakeholders to achieve enactment of health system reforms that include the following seven critical components of AMA policy: a. Health insurance coverage for all Americans b. Insurance market reforms that expand choice of affordable coverage and eliminate denials for pre-existing conditions or due to arbitrary c aps c. Assurance that health care decisions will remain in the hands of patients and their physicians, not insurance companies or government officials d. Investments and incentives for quality improvement and prevention and wellness initiatives e. Repeal of the Medicare physician payment formula that triggers steep cuts and threaten seniors' access to care f. Implementation of medical liability reforms to reduce the cost of defensive medicine g. Streamline and standardize insurance claims processing requir ements to eliminate unnecessary costs and administrative burdens 2. Our American Medical Association advocates that elimination of denials due to pre -existing conditions is understood to include rescission of insurance coverage for reasons not related to fraudulent representation. 3. Our American Medical Association House of Delegates supports AMA leadership in their unwavering and bold efforts to promote AMA policies for health system reform in the United States. 4. Our American Medical Association supp orts health system reform alternatives that are consistent with AMA policies concerning pluralism, freedom of choice, freedom of practice, and universal access for patients. 5. AMA policy is that insurance coverage options offered in a health insurance ex change be self-supporting, have uniform solvency requirements; not receive special advantages from government subsidies; include payment rates established through meaningful negotiations and contracts; not require provider participation; and not restrict e nrollees' access to out -of-network physicians. 6. Our AMA will actively and publicly support the inclusion in health system reform legislation the right of patients and physicians to privately contract, without penalty to patient or physician. 7. Our AMA w ill actively and publicly oppose the Independent Medicare Commission (or other similar construct), which would take Medicare payment policy out of the hands of Congress and place it under the control of a group of unelected individuals. 8. Our AMA will act ively and publicly oppose, in accordance with AMA policy, inclusion of the following provisions in health system reform legislation: Resolution 07 (A-19) Page 9 of 12 a. Reduced payments to physicians for failing to report quality data when there is evidence that widespread operational pro blems still have not been corrected by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services b. Medicare payment rate cuts mandated by a commission that would create a double -jeopardy situation for physicians who are already subject to an expenditure target and p otential payment reductions under the Medicare physician payment system c. Medicare payments cuts for higher utilization with no operational mechanism to assure that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can report accurate information that is pro perly attributed and risk -adjusted d. Redistributed Medicare payments among providers based on outcomes, quality, and risk - adjustment measurements that are not scientifically valid, verifiable and accurate e. Medicare payment cuts for all physician service s to partially offset bonuses from one specialty to another f. Arbitrary restrictions on physicians who refer Medicare patients to high quality facilities in which they have an ownership interest 9. Our AMA will continue to actively engage grassroots phy sicians and physicians in training in collaboration with the state medical and national specialty societies to contact their Members of Congress, and that the grassroots message communicate our AMA's position based on AMA policy. 10. Our AMA will use the m ost effective media event or campaign to outline what physicians and patients need from health system reform. 11. AMA policy is that national health system reform must include replacing the sustainable growth rate (SGR) with a Medicare physician payment sy stem that automatically keeps pace with the cost of running a practice and is backed by a fair, stable funding formula, and that the AMA initiate a \"call to action\" with the Federation to advance this goal. 12. AMA policy is that creation of a new single p ayer, government -run health care system is not in the best interest of the country and must not be part of national health system reform. 13. AMA policy is that effective medical liability reform that will significantly lower health care costs by reducing defensive medicine and eliminating unnecessary litigation from the system should be part of any national health system reform . Res. 203, I -09 Educating the American People About Health System Reform H -165.844 Our AMA reaffirms support of pluralism, freedom of enterprise and strong opposition to a single payer system. Res 717, I -07 Evaluating Health System Reform Proposals H -165.888 1. Our AMA will continue its efforts to ensure that health system reform proposals adhere to the following principles: A. Physicians maintain primary ethical responsibility to advocate for their patients' interests and needs. B. Unfair concentration of market power of payers is detrimental to patients and physicians, if patient freedom of choice or physician ability to selec t mode of practice is limited or Resolution 07 (A-19) Page 10 of 12 denied. Single -payer systems clearly fall within such a definition and, consequently, should continue to be opposed by the AMA. Reform proposals should balance fairly the market power between payers and physicians or be opp osed. C. All health system reform proposals should include a valid estimate of implementation cost, based on all health care expenditures to be included in the reform; and supports the concept that all health system reform proposals should identify specif ically what means of funding (including employer -mandated funding, general taxation, payroll or value -added taxation) will be used to pay for the reform proposal and what the impact will be. D. All physicians participating in managed care plans and medical delivery systems must be able without threat of punitive action to comment on and present their positions on the plan's policies and procedures for medical review, quality assurance, grievance procedures, credentialing criteria, and other financial and administrative matters, including physician representation on the governing board and key committees of the plan. E. Any national legislation for health system reform should include sufficient and continuing financial support for inner -city and rural hospitals, community health centers, clinics, special programs for special populations and other essential public health facilities that serve underserved populations that otherwise lack the financial means to pay for their health care. F. Health system reform proposals and ultimate legislation should result in adequate resources to enable medical schools and residency programs to produce an adequate supply and appropriate generalist/specialist mix of physicians to deliver patient care in a reformed healt h care system. G. All civilian federal government employees, including Congress and the Administration, should be covered by any health care delivery system passed by Congress and signed by the President. H. True health reform is impossible without true to rt reform. 2. Our AMA supports health care reform that meets the needs of all Americans including people with injuries, congenital or acquired disabilities, and chronic conditions, and as such values function and its improvement as key outcomes to be speci fically included in national health care reform legislation. 3. Our AMA supports health care reform that meets the needs of all Americans including people with mental illness and substance use / addiction disorders and will advocate for the inclusion of fu ll parity for the treatment of mental illness and substance use / addiction disorders in all national health care reform legislation. 4. Our AMA supports health system reform alternatives that are consistent with AMA principles of pluralism, freedom of cho ice, freedom of practice, and universal access for patients.

(2) Where school -based services exis t, the AMA recommends that they meet the following minimum standards: (a) Health services in schools must be supervised by a physician, preferably one who is experienced in the care of children and adolescents. Additionally, a physician should be accessibl e to administer care on a regular basis. (b) On -site services should be provided by a professionally prepared school nurse or similarly qualified health professional. Expertise in child and adolescent development, psychosocial and behavioral problems, and emergency care is desirable. Responsibilities of this professional would include coordinating the health care of students with the student, the parents, the school and the student's personal physician and assisting with the development and presentation of health education programs in the classroom. (c) There should be a written policy to govern provision of health services in the school. Such a policy should be developed by a school health council consisting of school and community -based physicians, nurses, school faculty and administrators, parents, and (as appropriate) students, community leaders and others. Health services and curricula should be carefully designed to reflect community standards and values, while emphasizing positive health practices in t he school environment. (d) Before patient services begin, policies on confidentiality should be established with the advice of expert legal advisors and the school health council. (e) Policies for ongoing monitoring, quality assurance and evaluation should be established with the advice of expert legal advisors and the school health council. (f) Health care services should be available during school hours. During other hours, an appropriate referral system should be instituted. (g) School -based health progr ams should draw on outside resources for care, such as private practitioners, public health and mental health clinics, and mental health and neighborhood health programs. (h) Services should be coordinated to ensure comprehensive care.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Health Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Populations H -160.991 1. Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must als o be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out l ocal or national experts in Resolution 09 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better und erstand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexual ly transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. 3. Our AMA will co ntinue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up -to- date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people.

Disability Coverage a) Each health care worker shou ld consider the risks of exposure to infectious agents posed by his/her type of practice and the likely consequences of infection in terms of changes needed in that practice mode and select disability insurance coverage accordingly. The policy selected sho uld contain a reasonable definition of \"sickness\" or \"disability,\" an own - occupation clause, and guaranteed renewability, future insurability, and partial disability provisions; b) In making determinations of disability, carriers should take into conside ration the recommendations of the professional and institutional staff with whom an infected health care worker is associated, including the worker's own personal physician; c) Since there are a variety of disability insurance coverages available and a d iversity of practice modes, each health care professional should individually assess his/her risk of infection and that of his/her employees and select disability coverage accordingly. CSA Rep. 4, A -03; Reaffirmed: CMS Rep. 4, A -13 Principles of and Actions to Address Medical Education Costs and Student Debt H - 305.925 The costs of medical education should never be a barrier to the pursuit of a career in medicine nor to the decision to practice in a given specialty. To help address this issue, our Amer ican Medical Association (AMA) will: 1. Collaborate with members of the Federation and the medical education community, and with other interested organizations, to address the cost of medical education and medical student debt through public - and private -sector advocacy. 2. Vigorously advocate for and support expansion of and adequate funding for federal scholarship and loan repayment programs \u2014such as those from the National Health Service Corps, Indian Health Service, Armed Forces, and Department of Vetera ns Affairs, and for comparable programs from states and the private sector \u2014to promote practice in underserved areas, the military, and academic medicine or clinical research. 3. Encourage the expansion of National Institutes of Health programs that provide loan repayment in exchange for a commitment to conduct targeted research. Resolution 11 (A-19) Page 6 of 8 4. Advocate for increased funding for the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment Program to assure adequate funding of primary care within the National Health Service Corps, a s well as to permit: (a) inclusion of all medical specialties in need, and (b) service in clinical settings that care for the underserved but are not necessarily located in health professions shortage areas. 5. Encourage the National Health Service Corps t o have repayment policies that are consistent with other federal loan forgiveness programs, thereby decreasing the amount of loans in default and increasing the number of physicians practicing in underserved areas. 6. Work to reinstate the economic hardshi p deferment qualification criterion known as the \"20/220 pathway,\" and support alternate mechanisms that better address the financial needs of trainees with educational debt. 7. Advocate for federal legislation to support the creation of student loan savin gs accounts that allow for pre -tax dollars to be used to pay for student loans. 8. Work with other concerned organizations to advocate for legislation and regulation that would result in favorable terms and conditions for borrowing and for loan repayment, and would permit 100% tax deductibility of interest on student loans and elimination of taxes on aid from service -based programs. 9. Encourage the creation of private -sector financial aid programs with favorable interest rates or service obligations (such as community - or institution -based loan repayment programs or state medical society loan programs). 10. Support stable funding for medical education programs to limit excessive tuition increases, and collect and disseminate information on medical school pr ograms that cap medical education debt, including the types of debt management education that are provided. 11. Work with state medical societies to advocate for the creation of either tuition caps or, if caps are not feasible, pre -defined tuition increase s, so that medical students will be aware of their tuition and fee costs for the total period of their enrollment. 12. Encourage medical schools to (a) Study the costs and benefits associated with non - traditional instructional formats (such as online and d istance learning, and combined baccalaureate/MD or DO programs) to determine if cost savings to medical schools and to medical students could be realized without jeopardizing the quality of medical education; (b) Engage in fundraising activities to increas e the availability of scholarship support, with the support of the Federation, medical schools, and state and specialty medical societies, and develop or enhance financial aid opportunities for medical students, such as self -managed, low-interest loan prog rams; (c) Cooperate with postsecondary institutions to establish collaborative debt counseling for entering first -year medical students; (d) Allow for flexible scheduling for medical students who encounter financial difficulties that can be remedied only b y employment, and consider creating opportunities for paid employment for medical students; (e) Counsel individual medical student borrowers on the status of their indebtedness and payment schedules prior to their graduation; (f) Inform students of all government loan opportunities and disclose the reasons that preferred lenders were chosen; (g) Ensure that all medical student fees are earmarked for specific and well -defined purposes, and avoid charging any overly broad and ill -defined fees, such as but not limited to professional fees; (h) Use their collective purchasing power to obtain discounts for their Resolution 11 (A-19) Page 7 of 8 students on necessary medical equipment, textbooks, and other educational supplies; (i) Work to ensure stable funding, to eliminate the need for increase s in tuition and fees to compensate for unanticipated decreases in other sources of revenue; mid -year and retroactive tuition increases should be opposed. 13. Support and encourage state medical societies to support further expansion of state loan repaymen t programs, particularly those that encompass physicians in non -primary care specialties. 14. Take an active advocacy role during reauthorization of the Higher Education Act and similar legislation, to achieve the following goals: (a) Eliminating the singl e holder rule; (b) Making the availability of loan deferment more flexible, including broadening the definition of economic hardship and expanding the period for loan deferment to include the entire length of residency and fellowship training; (c) Retainin g the option of loan forbearance for residents ineligible for loan deferment; (d) Including, explicitly, dependent care expenses in the definition of the \"cost of attendance\"; (e) Including room and board expenses in the definition of tax -exempt scholarshi p income; (f) Continuing the federal Direct Loan Consolidation program, including the ability to \"lock in\" a fixed interest rate, and giving consideration to grace periods in renewals of federal loan programs; (g) Adding the ability to refinance Federal Co nsolidation Loans; (h) Eliminating the cap on the student loan interest deduction; (i) Increasing the income limits for taking the interest deduction; (j) Making permanent the education tax incentives that our AMA successfully lobbied for as part of Econom ic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001; (k) Ensuring that loan repayment programs do not place greater burdens upon married couples than for similarly situated couples who are cohabitating; (l) Increasing efforts to collect overdue debts from the present medical student loan programs in a manner that would not interfere with the provision of future loan funds to medical students. 15. Continue to work with state and county medical societies to advocate for adequate levels of medical school fundi ng and to oppose legislative or regulatory provisions that would result in significant or unplanned tuition increases. 16. Continue to study medical education financing, so as to identify long -term strategies to mitigate the debt burden of medical students , and monitor the short -and long -term impact of the economic environment on the availability of institutional and external sources of financial aid for medical students, as well as on choice of specialty and practice location. 17. Collect and disseminate i nformation on successful strategies used by medical schools to cap or reduce tuition. 18. Continue to monitor the availability of and encourage medical schools and residency/fellowship programs to (a) provide financial aid opportunities and financial plann ing/debt management counseling to medical students and resident/fellow physicians; (b) work with key stakeholders to develop and disseminate standardized information on these topics for use by medical students, resident/fellow physicians, and young physici ans; and (c) share innovative approaches with the medical education community. 19. Seek federal legislation or rule changes that would stop Medicare and Medicaid decertification of physicians due to unpaid student loan debt. The AMA believes that it is improper for physicians not to repay their educational loans, but assistance should be available to those physicians who are experiencing hardship in meeting their obligations. Resolution 11 (A-19) Page 8 of 8 20. Related to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, our AMA support s increased medical student and physician benefits the program, and will: (a) Advocate that all resident/fellow physicians have access to PSLF during their training years; (b) Advocate against a monetary cap on PSLF and other federal loan forgiveness progr ams; (c) Work with the United States Department of Education to ensure that any cap on loan forgiveness under PSLF be at least equal to the principal amount borrowed; (d) Ask the United States Department of Education to include all terms of PSLF in the con tractual obligations of the Master Promissory Note; (e) Encourage the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to require residency/fellowship programs to include within the terms, conditions, and benefits of program appointment informa tion on the PSLF program qualifying status of the employer; (f) Advocate that the profit status of a physician's training institution not be a factor for PSLF eligibility; (g) Encourage medical school financial advisors to counsel wise borrowing by medical students, in the event that the PSLF program is eliminated or severely curtailed; (h) Encourage medical school financial advisors to increase medical student engagement in service -based loan repayment options, and other federal and military programs, as a n attractive alternative to the PSLF in terms of financial prospects as well as providing the opportunity to provide care in medically underserved areas; (i) Strongly advocate that the terms of the PSLF that existed at the time of the agreement remain unch anged for any program participant in the event of any future restrictive changes. 21. Advocate for continued funding of programs including Income -Driven Repayment plans for the benefit of reducing medical student load burden.

Res. 923, I -15; Appended: Res. 220, I -18 Statement of Principles on Mental Health H-345.999 (1) Tremendous strides have already been made in improving the care and treatment of t he emotionally disturbed, but much remains to be done. The mental health field is vast and includes a network of factors involving the life of the individual, the community and the nation. Any program designed to combat mental illness and promote mental health must, by the nature of the problems to be solved, be both ambitious and comprehensive. (2) The AMA recognizes the important stake every physician, regardless of type of practice, has in improving our mental health knowledge and resources. The physic ian participates in the mental health field on two levels, as an individual of science and as a citizen. The physician has much to gain from a knowledge of modern psychiatric principles and techniques, and much to contribute to the prevention, handling and management of emotional disturbances. Furthermore, as a natural community leader, the physician is in an excellent position to work for and guide effective mental health programs. (3) The AMA will be more active in encouraging physicians to become leaders in community planning for mental health . (4) The AMA has a deep interest in fostering a general attitude within the profession and among the lay public more conducive to solving the many problems existing in the mental health field. Res.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Redefining AMA's Position on ACA and Healthcare Reform D -165.93 8 1. Our AMA will develop a policy statement clearly stating this organization's policies on the following aspects of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and healthcare reform: A. Opposition to all P4P or VBP that fail to comply with the AMA's Principles and Guidelines; B. Repeal and appropriate replacement of the SGR; C. Repeal and replace the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) with a payment mechanism that complies with AMA principles and guidelines; D. Support for Medical Savings Accounts, Flexible Spending Accounts, and the Medicare Patient Empowerment Act (\"private contracting\"); E. Support step s that will likely produce reduced health care costs, lower health insurance premiums, provide for a sustainable expansion of healthcare coverage, and protect Medicare for future generations; F. Repeal the non -physician provider non -discrimination provis ions of the ACA. 2. Our AMA will immediately direct sufficient funds toward a multi -pronged campaign to accomplish these goals. 3. There will be a report back at each meeting of the AMA HOD. Strategies to Address Rising Health Care Costs H -155.960 Our AMA: (1) recognizes that successful cost -containment and quality -improvement initiatives must involve physician leadership, as well as collaboration among physicians, patients, insurers, employers, unions, and government; (2) supports the following broad strategies for addressing rising health care costs: (a) reduce the burden of preventable disease; (b) make health care delivery more efficient; (c) reduce non - clinical health system costs that do not contribute value to patient care; and (d) promote \"value -based decision -making\" at all levels; (3) will continue to advocate that physicians be supported in routinely providing lifestyle counseling to patients through: adequate third -party reimbursement; inclusion of lifestyle counseling in quality measurement a nd pay -for-performance incentives; and medical education and training; (4) will continue to advocate that sources of medical research funding give priority to studies that collect both clinical and cost data; use evaluation criteria that take into account cost impacts as well as clinical outcomes; translate research findings into useable information on the relative cost -effectiveness of alternative diagnostic services Resolution 15 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 and treatments; and widely disseminate cost -effectiveness information to physicians and other health care decision -makers; (5) will continue to advocate that health information systems be designed to provide physicians and other health care decision -makers with relevant, timely, actionable information, automatically at the point of care and wit hout imposing undue administrative burden, including: clinical guidelines and protocols; relative cost -effectiveness of alternative diagnostic services and treatments; quality measurement and pay -for- performance criteria; patient -specific clinical and insu rance information; prompts and other functionality to support lifestyle counseling, disease management, and case management; and alerts to flag and avert potential medical errors; (6) encourages the development and adoption of clinical performance and qual ity measures aimed at reducing overuse of clinically unwarranted services and increasing the use of recommended services known to yield cost savings; (7) encourages third -party payers to use targeted benefit design, whereby patient cost - sharing requirement s are determined based on the clinical value of a health care service or treatment. Consideration should be given to further tailoring cost -sharing requirements to patient income and other factors known to impact compliance; and (8) supports ongoing invest igation and cost -effectiveness analysis of non - clinical health system spending, to reduce costs that do not add value to patient care. (9) Our AMA will, in all reform efforts, continue to identify appropriate cost savings strategies for our patients and th e health care system. Voluntary Health Care Cost Containment H -155.998 (1) All physicians, including physicians in training, should become knowledgeable in all aspects of patient -related medical expenses, including hospital charges of both a service and p rofessional nature. (2) Physicians should be cost conscious and should exercise discretion, consistent with good medical care, in determining the medical necessity for hospitalization and the specific treatment, tests and ancillary medical services to be provided a patient. (3) Medical staffs, in cooperation with hospital administrators, should embark now upon a concerted effort to educate physicians, including house staff officers, on all aspects of hospital charges, including specific medical tests, proce dures, and all ancillary services. (4) Medical educators should be urged to include similar education for future physicians in the required medical school curriculum. (5) All physicians and medical staffs should join with hospital administrators and hospit al governing boards nationwide in a conjoint and across -the-board effort to voluntarily contain and control the escalation of health care costs, individually and collectively, to the greatest extent possible consistent with good medical care. (6) All physi cians, practicing solo or in groups, independently or in professional association, should review their professional charges and operating overhead with the objective of providing quality medical care at optimum reasonable patient cost through appropriatene ss of fees and efficient office management, thus favorably moderating the rate of escalation of health care costs. (7) The AMA should widely publicize and disseminate information on activities of the AMA and state, county and national medical specialty soc ieties which are designed to control or reduce the costs of health care.

Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition i s especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of th e medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientati on or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on an atomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmit ted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate pa rtner violence differs from their cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up -to- date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and cul turally competent care to LGBTQ people.

Available from: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK223632/ 1. RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Strategies for Enhancing Diversity in the Physician Workforce D -200.985 1. Our AMA, independently and in collaboration with other groups such as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC), will actively work and advocate for fun ding at the federal and state levels and in the private sector to support the following: a. Pipeline programs to prepare and motivate members of underrepresented groups to enter medical school; b. Diversity or minority affairs offices at medical schools; c . Financial aid programs for students from groups that are underrepresented in medicine; and d. Financial support programs to recruit and develop faculty members from underrepresented groups. 2. Our AMA will work to obtain full restoration and protection o f federal Title VII funding, and similar state funding programs, for the Centers of Excellence Program, Health Careers Opportunity Program, Area Health Education Centers, and other programs that support physician training, recruitment, and retention in geo graphically -underserved areas. 3. Our AMA will take a leadership role in efforts to enhance diversity in the physician workforce, including engaging in broad -based efforts that involve partners within and beyond the medical profession and medical education community. 4. Our AMA will encourage the Liaison Committee on Medical Education to assure that medical schools demonstrate compliance with its requirements for a diverse student body and faculty. 5. Our AMA will develop an internal education program for its members on the issues and possibilities involved in creating a diverse physician population. 6. Our AMA will provide on -line educational materials for its membership that address diversity issues in patient care including, but not limited to, culture, religion, race and ethnicity. 7. Our AMA will create and support programs that introduce elementary through high school students, especially those from groups that are underrepresented in medicine (URM), to healthcare careers. 8. Our AMA will create and su pport pipeline programs and encourage support services for URM college students that will support them as they move through college, medical school and residency programs. 9. Our AMA will recommend that medical school admissions committees use holistic assessments of admission applicants that take into account the diversity of preparation and the variety of talents that applicants bring to their education. Resolution 19 (A-19) Page 4 of 5 10. Our AMA will advocate for the tracking and reporting to interested stakeholders of demographic inf ormation pertaining to URM status collected from Electronic Residency Application Service (ERAS) applications through the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP). 11. Our AMA will continue the research, advocacy, collaborative partnerships and other work that was initiated by the Commission to End Health Care Disparities. 12. Our AMA opposes legislation that would undermine institutions' ability to properly employ affirmative action to promote a diverse student population.

Our AMA will develop publicatio ns, assessment tools, and a survey instrument to assist physicians and the federation with minority issues. The AMA will continue to strengthen relationships with minority physician organizations, will communicate its policies on the health care needs of m inorities, and will monitor and report on progress being made to address racial and ethnic disparities in care. It is the policy of our AMA to establish a mechanism to facilitate the development and implementation of a comprehensive, long -range, coordinate d strategy to address issues and concerns affecting minorities, including minority health, minority medical education, and minority membership in the AMA. Such an effort should include the following components: (1) Development, coordination, and strengthe ning of AMA resources devoted to minority health issues and recruitment of minorities into medicine; (2) Increased awareness and representation of minority physician perspectives in the Association's policy development, advocacy, and scientific activities ; (3) Collection, dissemination, and analysis of data on minority physicians and medical students, including AMA membership status, and on the health status of minorities; (4) Response to inquiries and concerns of minority physicians and medical students ; and (5) Outreach to minority physicians and minority medical students on issues involving minority health status, medical education, and participation in organized medicine. 2008. CLRPD Rep. 3, I -98, Reaffirmed: CLRPD Rep. 1, A -08 Reducing Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care D -350.995 Our AMA's initiative on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in health care will include the following recommendations: (1) Studying health system opportunities and barriers to eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care. (2) Working with public health and other appropriate agencies to increase medical student, resident physician, and practicing physician awareness of racial and ethnic disparities in health care and the role of professionalism and p rofessional obligations in efforts to reduce health care disparities. (3) Promoting diversity within the profession by encouraging publication of successful outreach programs that increase minority applicants to medical schools, and take Resolution 19 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 appropriate action to support such programs, for example, by expanding the \"Doctors Back to School\" program into secondary schools in minority communities. BOT Rep. 4, A -03; Reaffirmation: A -11; Reaffirmation: A -16 Youth Health Pipeline Programs Initiative 350.014MSS AMA -MSS (1) supports the establishment of a Medical Education Outreach Subcommittee for Disadvantaged Students, i.e., defined socially, economically, and/or educationally, under the umbrella of the Minority Issues Committee and under mentorship of the Mino rity Affairs Section, with the mission of forming long -term partnerships with local medical societies to develop pipeline programs that increase underrepresented in medicine (UIM) medical student enrollment, as defined by the AAMC and (2) will collaborate with medical school AMA Sections to partner with, but not limited to, the Student National Medical Association, the Latino Medical Student Association, the Asian Pacific American Medical Student Association, and other concerned organizations to support the development of medical career exposure and hands -on educational internship programs for underrepresented in medicine (UIM) and disadvantaged students. MSS Res 27, I -15 Availability of Medical Education 295.005MSS AMA -MSS supports the following principles: (1) A determined, conscientious effort to accept, matriculate, and graduate minority physicians must be undertaken. (2) Support for programs with a commitment to the training of minority medical professionals, particularly the three predominant ly black medical schools (Howard, Meharry, Morehouse) must be increased as necessary and maintained. (3) Adequate financial aid packages for minority students must be provided. These may include combinations of grants, loans, scholarships, or service oblig ated programs. (4) Efforts should be made to increase the proportion of minorities in medical school faculties and administrative positions. (5) Efforts must be made to improve retention rates of minority students in medical schools.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Code of Medical Ethics: 2.1.1 Informed Consent Informed consent to medical treatment is fundamental in both ethics and law. Patients have t he right to receive information and ask questions about recommended treatments so that they can make well -considered decisions about care. Successful communication in the patient -physician relationship fosters trust and supports shared decision making. Resolution 20 (A-19) Page 4 of 6 The process of informed consent occurs when communication between a patient and physician results in the patient's authorization or agreement to undergo a specific medical intervention. In seeking a patient's informed consent (or the consent of the patient's surrogate if the patient lacks decision -making capacity or declines to participate in making decisions), physicians should: (a) Assess the patient's ability to understand relevant medical information and the implications of treatment alternatives and to make an independent, voluntary decision. (b) Present relevant information accurately and sensitively, in keeping with the patient's preferences for receiving medical information. The physician should include information about: (i) the diagnosis (when known); (ii) the nature and purpose of recommended interventions; (iii) the burdens, risks, and expected benefits of all options, including forgoing treatment. (c) Document the informed consent conversation and the patient's (or surrogate's) decision i n the medical record in some manner. When the patient/surrogate has provided specific written consent, the consent form should be included in the record. In emergencies, when a decision must be made urgently, the patient is not able to participate in decision making, and the patient's surrogate is not available, physicians may initiate treatment without prior informed consent. In such situations, the physician should inform the patient/surrogate at the earliest opportunity and obtain consent for ongoing tr eatment in keeping with these guidelines. Code of Medical Ethics: 6.1.4 Presumed Consent & Mandated Choice for Organs from Deceased Donors Organ transplantation offers hope for patients suffering end -stage organ failure. However, the supply of organs for transplantation is inadequate to meet the clinical need. Proposals to increase donation have included studying possible financial incentives for donation and changing the approach to consent for cadaveric donation through \"presumed consent\" and \"mandated c hoice.\" Both presumed consent and mandated choice models contrast with the prevailing traditional model of voluntary consent to donation, in which prospective donors indicate their preferences, but the models raise distinct ethical concerns. Under presume d consent, deceased individuals are presumed to be organ donors unless they have indicated their refusal to donate. Donations under presumed consent would be ethically appropriate only if it could be determined that individuals were aware of the presumptio n that they were willing to donate organs and if effective and easily accessible mechanisms for documenting and honoring refusals to donate had been established. Physicians could proceed with organ procurement based on presumed consent only after verifying that there was no documented prior refusal and that the family was not aware of any objection to donation by the deceased. Under mandated choice, individuals are required to express their preferences regarding donation at the time they execute a state -regulated task. Donations under mandated choice would be ethically appropriate only if an individual's choice was made on the b asis of a meaningful exchange of information about organ donation in keeping with the principles of informed consent. Physicians could proceed with organ procurement based on mandated choice only after verifying that the individual's consent to donate was documented. Resolution 20 (A-19) Page 5 of 6 These models merit further study to determine whether either or both can be implemented in a way that meets fundamental ethical criteria for informed consent and provides clear evidence that their benefits outweigh ethical concerns. Physician s who propose to develop or participate in pilot studies of presumed consent or mandated choice should ensure that the study adheres to the following guidelines: (a) Is scientifically well designed and defines clear, measurable outcomes in a written proto col. (b) Has been developed in consultation with the population among whom it is to be carried out. (c) Has been reviewed and approved by an appropriate oversight body and is carried out in keeping with guidelines for ethical research. Unless there are da ta that suggest a positive effect on donation, neither presumed consent nor mandated choice for cadaveric organ donation should be widely implemented. Code of Medical Ethics: 6.1.3 Studying Financial Incentives for Cadaveric Organ Donation Physicians' eth ical obligations to contribute to the health of the public and to support access to medical care extend to participating in efforts to increase the supply of organs for transplantation. However, offering financial incentives for donation raises ethical con cerns about potential coercion, the voluntariness of decisions to donate, and possible adverse consequences, including reducing the rate of altruistic organ donation and unduly encouraging perception of the human body as a source of profit. These concerns merit further study to determine whether, overall, the benefits of financial incentives for organ donation outweigh their potential harms. It would be appropriate to carry out pilot studies among limited populations to investigate the effects of such fina ncial incentives for the purpose of examining and possibly revising current policies in the light of scientific evidence. Physicians who develop or participate in pilot studies of financial incentives to increase donation of cadaveric organs should ensure that the study: (a) Is strictly limited to circumstances of voluntary cadaveric donation with an explicit prohibition of the selling of organs. (b) Is scientifically well designed and clearly defines measurable outcomes and time frames in a written protoc ol. (c) Has been developed in consultation with the population among whom it is to be carried out. (d) Has been reviewed and approved by an appropriate oversight body, such as an institutional review board, and is carried out in keeping with guidelines fo r ethical research. (e) Offers incentives of only modest value and at the lowest level that can reasonably be expected to increase organ donation. Organ Donation and Honoring Organ Donor Wishes H -370.998 Our AMA: (1) continues to urge the citizenry to sign donor cards and supports continued efforts to educate the public on the desirability of, and the need for, organ donations, as well as the importance of discussing personal wishes regarding organ donation with appropriate family members; and (2) when a good faith effort has been made to contact the family, actively encourage Organ Procurement Organizations and physicians to adhere to provisions of the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act which allows for the procurement of organs when the family is absent and t here is a signed organ donor card or advanced directive stating the decedent's desire to donate the organs. Resolution 20 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 Organ Donation and Transplant s 370.003MSS AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to: (1) use public service announcements to enhance the general public's understanding of the procedures surrounding organ donation and transplant and increase the number of people who consent to be organ donors; and (2) research other ways of increasing the organ donor pool.

Attitudes and Counseling Practices of Pediatricians Regarding Youth Sports Participation and Concussion Risks, National Center for Biotechnology Information . May 2017. RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Reducing the Risk of Concussion and Other Injuries in Youth Sports H -470.959 (1) Our American Medical Association promotes the adoption of requirements that athletes participating in school or othe r organized youth sports and who are suspected by a coach, trainer, administrator, or other individual responsible for the health and well -being of athletes of Resolution 21 (A-19) Page 4 of 5 having sustained a concussion be removed immediately from the activity in which they are engaged and not return to competitive play, practice, or other sports -related activity without the written approval of a physician (MD or DO) or a designated member of the physician -led care team who has been properly trained in the evaluation and management of c oncussion. When evaluating individuals for return -to-play, physicians (MD or DO) or the designated member of the physician -led care team should be mindful of the potential for other occult injuries. (2) Our AMA encourages physicians to: (a) assess the deve lopmental readiness and medical suitability of children and adolescents to participate in organized sports and assist in matching a child's physical, social, and cognitive maturity with appropriate sports activities; (b) counsel young patients and their pa rents or caregivers about the risks and potential consequences of sports - related injuries, including concussion and recurrent concussions; (c) assist in state and local efforts to evaluate, implement, and promote measures to prevent or reduce the consequen ces of concussions, repetitive head impacts, and other injuries in youth sports; and (d) support preseason testing to collect baseline data for each individual.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 22 (A-19) Introduced by: Eleanor Burton, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Subject: Reducing Unnecessary Postoperative Labs Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez, Chair) Whereas, Patients commonly undergo postoperative lab testing in order to identify the need for 1 transfusions or alterations to their treatment plan1; and 2 3 Whereas, Many physicians believe postoperative lab tests to be a routine part of care, and 4 habitual lab ordering is often perpetuated by senior residents demanding lab results from their 5 junior counterparts without consideration or instruction as to when these labs are actually 6 indicated1,2; and 7 8 Whereas, The tendency to order postoperative labs for low -risk patients varies significantly 9 between attending physicians, fellows, and frontline physicians1; and 10 11 Whereas, Numerous studies have shown that postoperative labs are frequently unnecessary 12 and can have unintended negative consequences, such as hospital -acquired anemia, increased 13 length of hospital stay, hospital overcrowding, and needless follow -up testing for false positive 14 lab results1,3-5; and 15 16 Whereas, Despite 0% of patients in the pediatric intensive care unit at the Children's Hospital of 17 Philadelphia requir ing postoperative transfusions following endoscopic third ventriculostomy or 18 laryngotracheal reconstruction, greater than 80% and 65% of fellows co nsider postoperative 19 labs necessary to assess for the need for transfusion in these respective patient populations1; 20 and 21 22 Whereas, 73% of daily blood loss in the pediatric intensive care unit may be attributed to 23 phlebotomy , and many patients subsequently require blood transfusion as a result of hospital - 24 acquired anemia1,6; and 25 26 Whereas, The Society of Hospital Medicine urges against \"repetitive CBC and chemistry testing 27 in the face of clinical and lab stability\" on the basis that such procedures are positively 28 associated with dangerous declines in patient hemoglobin and hematocrit2,7,8; and 29 30 Wher eas, Studies have shown that as high as 6 8% of inpatient labs are either not indicated 31 given the patient's clinical presentation or do not alter the clinician's diagnostic approach or 32 management of patient care1,9; and 33 34 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 22 (A-19) Page 2 of 6 Whereas, The United States spends more on healthc are per capita than any other country 1 worldwide and, as of 2010, wasted an estimated $21 0 billion on unnecessary services10,11; and 2 3 Whereas, Phlebotomy costs for non -intensive care unit patients are estimated at $147.73 per 4 patient per day2; and 5 6 Whereas, Education of healthcare providers regarding lab test costs and unintended 7 consequences of redundant laboratory procedures, such as hospital -acquired anemia, has been 8 shown to reduce postoperative lab overutilization without any subsequent decline in patient 9 outcomes2,9; and 10 11 Whereas, A survey of over 1400 physicians in the United States found that a majority estimated 12 that 25% of medical tests are unnecessary and suggested implementing additional guidelines to 13 combat this issue10; and 14 15 Whereas , One intervention aimed at reducing unnecessary postoperative labs in the pediatric 16 intensive care unit setting through physician education and auditing succeeded in reducing 17 costs due to postoperative C omplete Blood Counts by 87% over a 6 -month period1; and 18 19 Whereas, High value care refers to care that maximizes patient outcomes and experience, while 20 minimizing costs and waste12,13; and 21 22 Whereas, Healthcare providers nationwide are making an effort to improve the value of care for 23 patients in the surgical setting, as indicated by the adoption of enhanced recovery after surgery 24 (ERAS) protocols by over 750 hospitals14,15; and 25 26 Whereas, ERAS protocols outline pathways to guide evidence -based care in the perioperative 27 setting and have effectively improved patient outcomes, while reducing length of hospital stay 28 and costs of care13,16,17; and 29 30 Whereas, Implementation of scoring algorithms for evidence -based care have improved patient 31 outcomes in numerous healthcare settings5,18-20; and 32 33 Whereas, Existing AMA policy H-410.971 provides that a lgorithms for evidence -based care 34 should allow room for continuous monitoring and improvement to inform clinical practices 35 without restricting physicians' autonomy to care for their patients to the best of their ability; and 36 37 Whereas, Existing AMA policy advocates for continuous efforts to improv e value of care through 38 \"quality comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER) \" (H-460.909); and 39 40 Whereas, Existing AMA policy H-410.971 delineates steps regarding the development, 41 implementation, and evaluation of clinical algorithms ; therefore be it 42 43 RESOLVED, That our AMA ask relevant stakeholders to develop an evidence -based algorithm 44 to guide orders of postoperative labs and urge ongoing evaluation and improvement of this 45 algorithm based on outc omes data ; and be it further 46 47 RESOLVED, That our AMA promote the education of healthcare providers regarding costs of 48 lab services, populations at low -risk for postoperative complications, and potential negative 49 consequences for repetitive lab procedures in the inpatient setting . 50 Fiscal Note: Significant, 12 Date Received: 0 4/21/2019 References: 1.

Kidney Int . 2015. doi:10.1038/ki.2015.245 RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Compara tive Effectiveness Research H -460.909 The following Principles for Creating a Centralized Comparative Effectiveness Research Entity are the official policy of our AMA: PRINCIPLES FOR CREATING A CENTRALIZED COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS RESEARCH ENTITY: A. Value . Value can be thought of as the best balance between benefits and costs, and better value as improved clinical outcomes, quality, and/or patient satisfaction per dollar spent. Improving value in the US health care system will require both clinical an d cost information. Quality comparative clinical effectiveness research (CER) will improve health care value by enhancing physician clinical judgment and fostering the delivery of patient -centered care. B. Independence. A federally sponsored CER entity sh ould be an objective, independent authority that produces valid, scientifically rigorous research. C. Stable Funding. The entity should have secure and sufficient funding in order to maintain the necessary infrastructure and resources to produce quality C ER. Funding source(s) must safeguard the independence of a federally sponsored CER entity. D. Rigorous Scientifically Sound Methodology. CER should be conducted using rigorous scientific methods to ensure that conclusions from such research are evidence -based and valid for the population studied. The primary responsibility for the conduct of CER and selection of CER methodologies must rest with physicians and researchers. E. Transparent Process. The processes for setting research priorities, establishing accepted methodologies, selecting researchers or research organizations, and disseminating findings must be transparent and provide physicians and researchers a central and significant role. F. Significant Patient and Physician Oversight Role. The oversig ht body of the CER entity must provide patients, physicians (MD, DO), including clinical practice physicians, and independent scientific researchers with substantial representation and a central decision -making role(s). Both physicians and patients are uni quely motivated to provide/receive quality care while maximizing value . Resolution 22 (A-19) Page 5 of 6 G. Conflicts of Interest Disclosed and Minimized. All conflicts of interest must be disclosed and safeguards developed to minimize actual, potential and perceived conflicts of interes t to ensure that stakeholders with such conflicts of interest do not undermine the integrity and legitimacy of the research findings and conclusions. H. Scope of Research. CER should include long term and short term assessments of diagnostic and treatment modalities for a given disease or condition in a defined population of patients. Diagnostic and treatment modalities should include drugs, biologics, imaging and laboratory tests, medical devices, health services, or combinations. It should not be limited to new treatments. In addition, the findings should be re -evaluated periodically, as needed, based on the development of new alternatives and the emergence of new safety or efficacy data. The priority areas of CER should be on high volume, high cost diagn osis, treatment, and health services for which there is significant variation in practice. Research priorities and methodology should factor in any systematic variations in disease prevalence or response across groups by race, ethnicity, gender, age, geogr aphy, and economic status. I. Dissemination of Research. The CER entity must work with health care professionals and health care professional organizations to effectively disseminate the results in a timely manner by significantly expanding dissemination capacity and intensifying efforts to communicate to physicians utilizing a variety of strategies and methods. All research findings must be readily and easily accessible to physicians as well as the public without limits imposed by the federally supported CER entity. The highest priority should be placed on targeting health care professionals and their organizations to ensure rapid dissemination to those who develop diagnostic and treatment plans. J. Coverage and Payment. The CER entity must not have a rol e in making or recommending coverage or payment decisions for payers. K. Patient Variation and Physician Discretion. Physician discretion in the treatment of individual patients remains central to the practice of medicine. CER evidence cannot adequately a ddress the wide array of patients with their unique clinical characteristics, co -morbidities and certain genetic characteristics. In addition, patient autonomy and choice may play a significant role in both CER findings and diagnostic/treatment planning in the clinical setting. As a result, sufficient information should be made available on the limitations and exceptions of CER studies so that physicians who are making individualized treatment plans will be able to differentiate patients to whom the study f indings apply from those for whom the study is not representative. Clinical Algorithm Impact on Patient Care H -410.971 The AMA has established the following policy that incorporates provisions regarding the use and development of clinical algorithms, which may include the following: (1) Clinical algorithms are guidelines established to aid a physician in the diagnosis and treatment of patients. As such, they should be used by the physicians as guidelines, but recognizing that each patient is an individual and has unique needs and problems, the physician should use his or her best judgment in the use of the guidelines and sh ould never be forced to specifically follow these guidelines rigidly. (2) Clinical algorithms should include suggested tests and procedures to arrive at a correct diagnosis in the most direct and expeditious manner. These guidelines should suggest criteria as to when referrals to the correct specialist/subspecialist are appropriate and in the best interest of the patient. (3) The treating physicians should always have the option of ordering the suggested tests, procedures and referrals at their discretion, and may opt to make these choices earlier or later than is suggested, and is not mandated to make any of these choices, depending on their clinical assessment of the patient and their needs. (4) When the Resolution 22 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 algorithms are created, physicians from the specialt y(ies)/subspecialty(ies) who diagnose and treat the condition should participate in their creation. These physicians should be representatives from their official specialty society(ies). (5) The validity of any clinical algorithms should be under constant review and evaluation by the appropriate specialty/subspecialty society(ies). (6) Whenever possible consensus clinical data from peer review journals will be used. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 23 (A-19) Introduced by: Andrew Huang, Nick Horswill, Samantha Prince, University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health Subject: Transparency Improving Informed Consent for Reproductive Health Services Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas, Federal regulations passed by Health and Human Services in 2018 and state laws 1 allow organizations to refuse coverage and services for contraceptives and infertility care 2 mandated in the Affordable Care Act;1,2 and 3 4 Whereas, Institutional obligati ons under those refusals impinge on a physician's ability to follow 5 standard of care in consulting and providing reproductive health services3; and 6 7 Whereas, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecology (ACOG) guidelines state that 8 physicians are obligated to inform patients of their prior personal moral commitments and refer 9 patients to other providers in cases of moral or religious objection for management, medication, 10 or surgical evacuation4,5; and 11 12 Whereas, The American Medical Association advo cates for transparency when best practice 13 medical care may conflict with a physician's or their institution's commitments;7 which is not 14 currently occurring according to a recent national survey of obstetricians and gynecologists 15 showing that 35% of non -abortion providers would not provide a referral to a different institution 16 for the service7; and 17 18 Whereas, Reproductive healthcare access is vital to the health and wellbeing of both the mother 19 and her child given that mistimed pregnancies are associated wit h poor or delayed prenatal 20 care, negative birth outcomes, Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs) and cervical cancer of the 21 mother8,9; and 22 23 Whereas, Contraceptive care has applications beyond family planning: improving patient safety 24 when given in conjunct ion with teratogenic medications, protecting women who have significant 25 likelihood of mortality with pregnancy, or during teratogenic disease outbreaks like the 2016 26 Zika Virus 10, 11; and 27 28 Whereas, Emergency contraception is widely utilized as 28.4% of wo men of reproductive age in 29 the United States have used emergency contraceptives12; and 30 31 Whereas, Public expenditures on family planning services save seven dollars on future 32 expenditures for each dollar spent on these measures by reducing the incidence of preterm and 33 low birth weight births, STIs, infertility, and cervical cancer13; and 34 35 Next Table of Contents Previous Resolution 23 (A-19) Page 2 of 11 Whereas, Infertility services including I n-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and ova/sperm retrieval service 1 availability varies significantly between state s, insurance policies, a nd hospital systems14; and 2 3 Whereas, Studies have shown patients are, \"in dire need of positive rights to information about 4 and services to avoid the potential gap in care\" which non -transparent clinical policies present,9 5 similar to the Medicare overhaul s currently underway for price transparency15; therefore, be it, 6 7 RESOLVED, That our AMA will work with relevant stakeholders (A merican College of 8 Obstetricians and Gynecologists , American Academy of Family Physicians , and United Nations 9 Population Fund (UNFPA) ) to establish a list of Essential Reproductive Health Services, 10 including but not limited to: 11 Full contraception counseling including: 12 o Medication and device related contraceptives 13 o Prescription/provision of contraception including oral/topical medications 14 o Insertion and removal of IUDs, implanted devices 15 o Emergency contraception medication prescription in any circumstance 16 o Full spectrum sexual assault evaluation including STI testing and treatment and 17 emergency contraception provision 18 o Miscarriage a nd ectopic pregnancy treatment 19 Postpartum and interval sterilization 20 Infertility treatments that include ovulation medications 21 Intrauterine insemination 22 In vitro fertilization 23 Ova and sperm retrieval and storage for future reproduction needs, and be it fur ther 24 25 RESOLVED, That our AMA will advocate for legislation requiring healthcare organizations to 26 clearly publish online and in points of service which of these Essential Reproductive Health 27 Services are available at the organization along with any restrict ions on any of these services at 28 this institution. 29 Fiscal Note: Significant, 12 Date Received: 04/21/2019 References : 1. \"Insurance Coverage of yCGJ2o785GHd4SlL6WRj7ew - 6eG68kNhILeAOaBRdO_7Ukljhrotg .

AMA Principles for Physician Employment H -225.950 1. Addressing Conflicts of Interest a) A physician's paramount responsibility is to his or her patients. Additionally, given that an employed physician occupies a position of significant trust, he or she owes a duty of loyalty to his or her employer. This divided loyalty can create conflicts of interest, such as financial incentives to over - or under -treat patients, which employed physi cians should strive to recognize and address. b) Employed physicians should be free to exercise their personal and professional judgment in voting, speaking, and advocating on any matter regarding patient care interests, the profession, health care in the community, and the independent exercise of medical judgment. Employed physicians should not be deemed in breach of their employment agreements, nor be retaliated against by their employers, for asserting these interests. c) In any situation where the econo mic or other interests of the employer are in conflict with patient welfare, patient welfare must take priority. d) Physicians should always make treatment and referral decisions based on the best interests of their patients. Employers and the physicians t hey employ must assure that agreements or understandings (explicit or implicit) restricting, discouraging, or encouraging particular treatment or referral options are disclosed to patients. (i) No physician should be required or coerced to perform or assis t in any non -emergent procedure that would be contrary to his/her religious beliefs or moral convictions; and (ii) No physician should be discriminated against in employment, promotion, or the extension of staff or other privileges because he/she either pe rformed or assisted in a lawful, non -emergent procedure, or refused to do so on the grounds that it violates his/her religious beliefs or moral Convictions. Resolution 23 (A-19) Page 5 of 11 6. Increasing Availability and Coverage for Immediate Postpartum Long -Acting Reversible Contracept ive Placement H -75.984 \"Our AMA: (a) recognizes the practice of immediate postpartum and post pregnancy long -acting reversible contraception placement to be a safe and cost effective way of reducing future unintended pregnancies; and (b) supports the cover age by Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurers for immediate postpartum long -acting reversible contraception devices and placement, and that these be billed separately from the obstetrical global fee.\" 7. Abortion H -5.995 Our AMA reaffirms that: (1) abor tion is a medical procedure and should be performed only by a duly licensed physician and surgeon in conformance with standards of good medical practice and the Medical Practice Act of his state; and (2) no physician or other professional personnel shall b e required to perform an act violative of good medical judgment. Neither physician, hospital, nor hospital personnel shall be required to perform any act violative of personally held moral principles. In these circumstances, good medical practice requires only that the physician or other professional withdraw from the case, so long as the withdrawal is consistent with good medical practice. 8. Policy on Abortion H -5.990 The issue of support of or opposition to abortion is a matter for members of the AMA to decide individually, based on personal values or beliefs. The AMA will take no action which may be construed as an attempt to alter or influence the personal views of individual physicians regarding abortion procedures. 9.

Our AMA encourage hospitals to publicly disclose the following parameters of their contracts for the delivery of clinical and non -clinical services: (a) The entity with which the hospital h as contracted; (b) The ownership of the entity with which the hospital has contracted; (c) What services are being provided in accordance with the contract; (d) Which entity owners, if any, serve on any of the hospital's boards or its affiliates' boards; a nd (e) Whether the hospital requires exclusive physician referrals to hospital subsidiaries for services. 2. AMA policy is that the organized medical staffs have an opportunity to be involved in the selection of clinical and non -clinical service providers in hospitals with adherence to appropriate conflict of interest policies. 10. Price Transparency D -155.987 1. Our AMA encourages physicians to communicate information about the cost of their professional services to individual patients, taking into consid eration the insurance status (e.g., self-pay, in -network insured, out -of-network insured) of the patient or other relevant information where possible. 2. Our AMA advocates that health plans provide plan enrollees or their designees with complete informatio n regarding plan benefits and real time cost -sharing information associated with both in-network and out -of-network provider services or other plan designs that may affect patient out-of-pocket costs. Resolution 23 (A-19) Page 6 of 11 3. Our AMA will actively engage with health plans, publ ic and private entities, and other stakeholder groups in their efforts to facilitate price and quality transparency for patients and physicians, and help ensure that entities promoting price transparency tools have processes in place to ensure the accuracy and relevance of the information they provide. 4. Our AMA will work with states to support and strengthen the development of all -payer claims databases. 5. Our AMA encourages electronic health records vendors to include features that assist in facilitating price transparency for physicians and patients. 6. Our AMA encourages efforts to educate patients in health economics literacy, including the development of resources that help patients understand the complexities of health care pricing and en courage them to seek information regarding the cost of health -care services they receive or anticipate receiving. 7. Our AMA will request that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expand its Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Look -up Tool to include hospital outpatient payments. 11. 75.005MSS Promotion of Emergency Contraception Pills AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to: (1) support public health education relating to emergency contraception pills (ECPs) by working in conjunction with the appropriate specia lty societies and organizations to encourage the widespread dissemination of information on ECPs to the medical community, women's groups, health groups, clinics, the public and the media; and (2) advocate programs that provide improved access to emergency contraception pills for women during after -hours need.

(MSS Rep B, A -04) 16. AMA statement on Title X gag rule and funding restrictions \"This rule interferes with and imposes restrictions on the patient -physician relationship. For all intents and purposes, it imposes a gag rule on what information physicians can provide to their patients. The patient -physician rel ationship relies on trust, open conversation and informed decision making and the government should not be telling physicians what they can and cannot say to their patients. \"Protecting the sanctity of the patient -physician relationship and defending the freedom of communication between patients and their physicians is a fundamental priority for the AMA. With this action, the administration wants to block physicians from counseling patients about all of their healthcare options and from providing appropria te referrals for care. This is a clear violation of patients' rights in the Code of Medical Ethics . \"The AMA also strongly objects to the administration's plan to withhold fe deral family planning funding from entities that provide critical medical services to vulnerable populations. Millions of women depend on the Title X program for access to much -needed healthcare including cancer screenings, birth control, STI testing and t reatment, and other exams. This is the wrong prescription and threatens to compound a health equity deficit in this nation. Women should have access to these medical services regardless of where they live, how much money they make, their background, or whe ther they have health insurance. \"Title X is popular, successful, and has had bipartisan support for decades. Our country is at a 30-year low for unintended pregnancy and an historic low for pregnancy among teenagers \u2014 largely because of expanded access to birth control. We should not be walking back from that progress.\" 17. Preconception Care H -425.976 1. Our AMA supports the 10 recommendations developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for improving preconception health care that state: (1) Individual responsibility across the lifespan --each woman, man, and couple should be encouraged to have a reproductive life plan; (2) Consumer awareness --increase public awareness of the importance of preconception health behaviors and preconception care services by using information and tools appropriate across various ages; literacy, including health literacy; and cultural/linguistic contexts; Resolution 23 (A-19) Page 8 of 11 (3) Preventive visits --as a part of primary care visits, provide risk assessment and educational and health p romotion counseling to all women of childbearing age to reduce reproductive risks and improve pregnancy outcomes; (4) Interventions for identified risks --increase the proportion of women who receive interventions as follow -up to preconception risk screenin g, focusing on high priority interventions (i.e., those with evidence of effectiveness and greatest potential impact); (5) Inter -conception care--use the inter -conception period to provide additional intensive interventions to women who have had a previous pregnancy that ended in an adverse outcome (i.e., infant death, fetal loss, birth defects, low birth weight, or preterm birth); (6) Pre -pregnancy checkup --offer, as a component of maternity care, one pre -pregnancy visit for couples and persons planning pr egnancy; (7) Health insurance coverage for women with low incomes --increase public and private health insurance coverage for women with low incomes to improve access to preventive women's health and pre -conception and inter -conception care; (8) Public health programs and strategies --integrate components of pre -conception health into existing local public health and related programs, including emphasis on inter-conception interventions for women with previous adverse outcomes; (9) Research --increase the evidence base and promote the use of the evidence to improve preconception health; and (10) Monitoring improvements --maximize public health surveillance and related research mechanisms to monitor preconception health. 2. Our AMA supports the education of physicians and the public about the importance of preconception care as a vital component of a woman's reproductive health.

Sub. Res. 224, I -15; Reaffirmation: I -17 20. 4.2.1 Assisted Reproductive Technology Assisted reproduction offers hope to patients who want children but are unable to have a child without medical assistance. In many cases, patients who seek assistance have been repeatedly frustrated in their attempts to have a child and are psychologically very vulnerable. Patients whose health insurance does not cover assisted reproductive services may also be financially vulnerable. Candor and respect are thus essential for ethical practice. \"Assisted reproductive technology \" is understood as all treatments or procedures that include the handling of human oocytes or embryos. It encompasses an increasingly complex range of interventions \u2014such as therapeutic donor insemination, ovarian stimulation, ova and sperm retrieval, in vitro fertilization, gamete intrafallopian transfer \u2014and may involve multiple participants. Physicians should increase their awareness of infertility treatments and options for their patients. Physicians who offer assisted reproductive services should: (a) Value the well -being of the patient and potential offspring as paramount. (b) Ensure that all advertising for services and promotional materials are accurate and not misleading. (c) Provide patients with all of the information they need to make an informed decision, including investigational techniques to be used (if any); risks, benefits, and limitations of treatment options and alternatives, for the patient and p otential offspring; accurate, clinic - specific success rates; and costs. (d) Provide patients with psychological assessment, support and counseling or a referral to such services. (e) Base fees on the value of the service provided. Physicians may ente r into agreements with patients to refund all or a portion of fees if the patient does not conceive where such agreements are legally permitted. (f) Not discriminate against patients who have difficult -to-treat conditions, whose infertility has multiple causes, or on the basis of race, socioeconomic status, or sexual orientation or gender identity. (g) Participate in the development of peer -established guidelines and self -regulation.

Patient Information and Choice H -373.998 Our AMA supports the following principles: 1. Greater reliance on market forces, with patients empowered with understandable fee/price information and incentives to make prudent choices, and with the medical profession empowered to enforce ethical and clinical standards which continue to place patients' interests first, is clearly a more effective and preferable approach to cost containment than is a government -run, budget -driven, centrally controlled health care system. 2. Individuals sho uld have freedom of choice of physician and/or system of health care delivery. Where the system of care places restrictions on patient choice , such restrictions must be clearly identified to the individual prior to their selection of that system . 3. In order to facilitate cost -conscious, informed market -based decision -making in health care, physicians, hospitals, pharmacies, durable medical equipment suppliers, and other health care providers should be required to make information readily available to co nsumers on fees/prices charged for frequently provided services, procedures, and products, prior to the provision of such services, procedures, and products. There should be a similar requirement that insurers make available in a standard format to enrolle es andprospective enrollees information on the amount of payment provided toward each type of service identified as a covered benefit. 4. Federal and/or state legislation should authorize medical societies to operate programs for the review of patient complaints about fees, services, etc. Such programs would be specifically authorized to arbitrate a fee or portion thereof as appropriate and to mediate voluntary agreements, and could include the input of the state medical society and the AMA Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. 5. Physicians are the patient advocates in the current health system reform debate. Efforts should continue to seek development of a plan that will effectively provide universal access to an affordable and adequate spectrum of health care services, maintain the quality of such services, and preserve patients' freedom to select physicians and/or health plans of their choice . 6. Efforts should continue to vigorously pursue with Congress and the Administration the strengthening of our health care system for the benefit of all patients and physicians by advocating policies that put patients, and the patient /physician relationships, at the forefront.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Support for Drug Courts H -100.955 Our AMA: (1) supports the establishment of drug courts as an effective method of intervention for individuals with addictive disease who ar e convicted of nonviolent crimes; and (2) encourages legislators to establish drug courts at the state and local level in the United States. Res 201, A -12 Court -Initiated Medical Treatments in Criminal Cases E -9.7.2 Court -initiated medical treatments rais e important questions as to the rights of prisoners, the powers of judges, and the ethical obligations of physicians. Although convicted criminals have fewer rights and protections than other citizens, being convicted of a crime does not deprive an offende r of all protections under the law. Court -ordered medical treatments raise the question whether professional ethics permits physicians to cooperate in administering and overseeing such treatment. Physicians have civic duties, but medical ethics do not requ ire a physician to carry out civic duties that contradict fundamental principles of medical ethics, such as the duty to avoid doing harm. In limited circumstances physicians can ethically participate in court -initiated medical treatments. Individual physic ians who provide care under court order should: (a) Participate only if the procedure being mandated is therapeutically efficacious and is therefore undoubtedly not a form of punishment or solely a mechanism of social control. (b) Treat patients based on s ound medical diagnoses, not court -defined behaviors. While a court has the authority to identify criminal behavior, a court does not have the ability to make a medical diagnosis or to determine the type of treatment that will be administered. When the treatment involves in -patient therapy, surgical intervention, or pharmacological treatment, the physician's diagnosis must be confirmed by an independent physician or a panel of physicians not responsible to the state. A second opinion is not necessary in case s of court -ordered counseling or referrals for psychiatric evaluations. (c) Decline to provide treatment that is not scientifically validated and consistent with nationally accepted guidelines for clinical practice.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY AMA Advocacy for Environmental Sustainability and Climate H -135.923 Our AMA (1) supports initiatives to promote environmental sustainability and other efforts to halt global climate change; (2) will incorporate principles of environmental sustainability within its business operations; and (3) supports physicians in adopting programs for environmental sustainability in their practices and help physicians to share these concepts with their patients and with their c ommunities. Res. 924, I -16 Global Climate Change and Human Health H -135.938 Resolution 25 (A-19) Page 6 of 7 Our AMA: 1. Supports the findings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's fourth assessment report and concurs with the scientific consensus that the Earth is undergoin g adverse global climate change and that anthropogenic contributions are significant. These climate changes will create conditions that affect public health, with disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and the poor. 2. Supports educating the medical community on the potential adverse public health effects of global climate change and incorporating the health implications of climate change into the spectrum of medical education, including topics such as populatio n displacement, heat waves and drought, flooding, infectious and vector -borne diseases, and potable water supplies. 3. (a) Recognizes the importance of physician involvement in policymaking at the state, national, and global level and supports efforts to s earch for novel, comprehensive, and economically sensitive approaches to mitigating climate change to protect the health of the public; and (b) recognizes that whatever the etiology of global climate change, policymakers should work to reduce human contrib utions to such changes. 4. Encourages physicians to assist in educating patients and the public on environmentally sustainable practices, and to serve as role models for promoting environmental sustainability. 5. Encourages physicians to work with local and state health departments to strengthen the public health infrastructure to ensure that the global health effects of climate change can be anticipated and responded to more efficiently, and that the AMA's Center for Public Health Preparedness and Disast er Response assist in this effort. 6.

Nutrition Labeling and Nutritionally Improved Menu Offerings in Fast -Food and Other Chain Restaurants H -150.945 Our AMA: 1. supports federal, state, and local policies to require fast -food and other chain restaurants with 10 or more units (smaller, neighborhood restaurants could be exempt) to provide consumers with nutrition information on menus and menu boards; 2. recommen ds that nutrition information in fast -food and other chain restaurants include calorie, fat, saturated fat and trans fat, and sodium labeling on printed menus, and, at a minimum, calories on menu boards, since they have limited space, and that all nutritio n information be conspicuous and easily legible; 3. urges federal, state, and local health agencies, health organizations, and physicians and other health professionals to educate people how to use the nutrition information provided in restaurants to make healthier food choices for themselves and their families; and 4. urges restaurants to improve the nutritional quality of their menu offerings --for example, by reducing caloric content; offering smaller portions; offering more fruits, vegetables, and whol e- grain items; using less sodium; using cooking fats lower in saturated and trans fats; and using less added sugars/sweeteners. H-150.944 (MSS Endorsed - Res 33, I -13) Increasing Healthy Food Options in School Lunches for Elementary and Middle School Students The MSS formally establishes support for the following HOD policies: H-150.944 Combating Obesity and Health Disparities Our AMA supports efforts to: (1) reduce health disparities by basing food assistance programs on the health needs of their co nstituents; (2) provide vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, vegetarian foods, and healthful nondairy beverages in school lunches and food assistance programs; and (3) ensure that federal subsidies encourage the consumption of products low in fat and chole sterol. (Res. 413, A -07; Reaffirmation A -12; Reaffirmation A -13) H-150.962 Quality of School Lunch Program The AMA recommends to the National School Lunch Program that school meals be congruent with current U.S. Department of Agriculture/Department of HHS Dietary Guidelines.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Methadone Maintenance and Transplantation H -370.973 Our AMA: (1) urges transplant centers across the nation to abrogate any policies that automatically exclude patients maintained on methadone from liver transplant recipient waiting lists; and (2) encourages transplant centers to assess patients maintained on methadone on a case-by-case basis using medically appropriate criteria supportable by peer -reviewed and published research. Ethical Considerations in the Allocation of Organs and Other Scarce Medical Resources Among Patients H -370.982 Our AMA has adopted the following gu idelines as policy: (1) Decisions regarding the allocation of scarce medical resources among patients should consider only ethically appropriate criteria relating to medical need. (a) These criteria include likelihood of benefit, urgency of need, change in quality of life, duration of benefit, and, in some cases, the amount of resources required for successful treatment. In general, only very substantial differences among patients are ethically relevant; the greater the disparities, the more justified the u se of these criteria becomes. In making quality of life judgments, patients should first be prioritized so that death or extremely poor outcomes are avoided; then, patients should be prioritized according to change in quality of life, but only when there a re very substantial differences among patients. (b) Research should be pursued to increase knowledge of outcomes and thereby improve the accuracy of these criteria. (c) Non -medical criteria, such as ability to pay, social worth, perceived obstacles to trea tment, patient contribution to illness, or past use of resources should not be considered. (2) Allocation decisions should respect the individuality of patients and the particulars of individual cases as much as possible. (a) All candidates for treatment must be fully considered according to ethically appropriate criteria relating to medical need, as defined in Guideline 1. (b) Resolution 27 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 When very substantial differences do not exist among potential recipients of treatment on the basis of these criteria, a \"first -come-first-served\" approach or some other equal opportunity mechanism should be employed to make final allocation decisions. (c) Though there are several ethically acceptable strategies for implementing these criteria, no single strategy is ethically mandate d. Acceptable approaches include a three -tiered system, a minimal threshold approach, and a weighted formula. (3) Decision making mechanisms should be objective, flexible, and consistent to ensure that all patients are treated equally. The nature of the p hysician -patient relationship entails that physicians of patients competing for a scarce resource must remain advocates for their patients, and therefore should not make the actual allocation decisions. (4) Patients must be informed by their physicians of allocation criteria and procedures, as well as their chances of receiving access to scarce resources. This information should be in addition to all the customary information regarding the risks, benefits, and alternatives to any medical procedure. Patient s denied access to resources have the right to be informed of the reasoning behind the decision. (5) The allocation procedures of institutions controlling scarce resources should be disclosed to the public as well as subject to regular peer review from th e medical profession. (6) Physicians should continue to look for innovative ways to increase the availability of and access to scarce medical resources so that, as much as possible, beneficial treatments can be provided to all who need them. (7) Physicia ns should accept their responsibility to promote awareness of the importance of an increase in the organ donor pool using all available means. Equal Access to Organ Transplantation for Medicaid Beneficiaries H -370.962 Our AMA supports federal funding of o rgan transplants for Medicaid patients. Methadone Maintenance and Transplantation H -370.973 Our AMA: (1) urges transplant centers across the nation to abrogate any policies that automatically exclude patients maintained on methadone from liver transplant recipient waiting lists; and (2) encourages transplant centers to assess patients maintained on methadone on a case -by-case basis using medically appropriate criteria supportable by peer -reviewed and published research. Teen and Young Adult Suicide in the United States H -60.937 Our AMA recognizes teen and young -adult suicide as a serious health concern in the US. Support for the Use of Evidence -Based Guidelines for Determining Liver Transplant Waiting Periods in Alcohol -Related Liver Disease 370.019MSS Our AMA -MSS supports the use of evidence -based guidelines for determining liver transplant waiting periods in alcohol -related liver disease (MSS Res 08, A -18) Removal of Cannabis as a Relative Contraindication for Potential Organ Transplant 370.014MSS AMA -MSS opposes utilization of 1) reported marijuana use; and 2) positive cannabis toxicology tests as a relative contraindication for potential organ transplant recipients.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Protecting the Public from Dangers of Ultraviolet Radiation H -440.839 1. Our AMA encourages physicians to counsel their patients on sun -protective behavior. 2. Tanning Parlors: Our AMA supports: (1) educational campaigns on the hazards of tanning parlors, as well as the development of local tanning parlor ordinances to protect our patients and the general public from improper and dangerous exposure to ultravio let radiation; (2) legislation to strengthen state laws to make the consumer as informed and safe as possible; (3) dissemination of information to physicians and the public about the dangers of ultraviolet light from sun exposure and the possible harmful e ffects of the ultraviolet light used in commercial tanning centers; (4) collaboration between medical societies and schools to achieve the inclusion of information in the health curricula on the hazards of exposure to tanning rays; (5) the enactment of fed eral legislation to: (a) prohibit access to the use of indoor tanning equipment (as defined in 21 CFR ?1040.20 [a][9]) by anyone under the age of 18; and (b) require a United States Surgeon General warning be prominently posted, detailing the positive correlation between ultraviolet radiation, the use of indoor tanning equipment, and the incidence of skin cancer; (6) warning the public of the risks of ultraviolet A radiation (UVA) exposure by skin tanning units, particularly the FDA's findings warning Ameri cans that the use of UVA tanning booths and sun beds pose potentially significant health risks to users and should be discouraged; (7) working with the FDA to ensure that state and local authorities implement legislation, rules, and regulations regarding U VA exposure, including posted warnings in commercial tanning salons and spas; (8) an educational campaign in conjunction with various concerned national specialty societies to secure appropriate state regulatory and oversight activities for tanning parlor facilities, to reduce improper and dangerous exposure to ultraviolet light by patients and general public consumers; and (9) intensified efforts to enforce current regulations. 3. Sunscreens. Our AMA supports: (1) the development of sunscreens that will protect the skin from a broad spectrum of ultraviolet radiation, including both UVA and UVB; and (2) the labeling Resolution 28 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 of sunscreen products with a standardized ultraviolet (UV) logo, inclusive of ratings for UVA and UVB, so that consumers will know whether the se products protect against both types of UV radiation. Terms such as low, medium, high and very high protection should be defined depending on standardized sun protection factor level. Permitting Sunscreen in Schools H -440.841 1. Our AMA supports the exe mption of sunscreen from over -the-counter medication possession bans in schools and encourages all schools to allow students to bring and possess sunscreen at school without restriction and without requiring physician authorization. 2. Our AMA will work w ith state and specialty medical societies and patient advocacy groups to provide advocacy resources and model legislation for use in state advocacy campaigns seeking the removal of sunscreen -related bans at schools and summer camp programs. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 29 (A-19) Introduced by: Region 2; Region 6 Subject: Accurate Collection of Preferred Language and Disaggregated Race & Ethnicity to Characterize Health Disparities Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez, Chair) _________ ____________________________ _______________________________________ Whereas, The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is 1 the principal federal entity coordinating the electronic exchange of health information1; and 2 3 Whereas, The U.S. Census collects data based on racial self -identification as White, Black or 4 African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, Asian, and Native Hawaiian or Other 5 Pacific Islander2; and 6 7 Whereas, In addition to existing between racial and ethnic groups, health disparities exist within 8 U.S. Census -defined racial and ethnic groups3,4; and 9 10 Whereas, \"Disaggregating racial and ethnic data\" is defined for the purpose of this resolution as 11 subdividing U.S. Census -defined racial or ethnic (i.e. Hispanic and non -Hispanic) designations 12 into ethnic subg roups (i.e. by splitting \"Asian\" into Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Laotian, 13 Burmese, Pakistani, Indian, etc.)4; and 14 15 Whereas, A series of systematic literature reviews reported to the Robert W ood Johnson 16 Foundation identified that within -group disparities were more accurately accounted for by 17 research methodologies that used disaggregated racial and ethnic data among American 18 Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN); Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pac ific Islander (AANHPI); 19 Latinx; non -Hispanic White Americans; and Black/African American populations4; and 20 21 Whereas, Despite being classified as \"White\" by the U.S. Census and other registries, several 22 population -level disparities exist between Arab Ameri cans and other \"White\" ethnic groups5; and 23 24 Whereas, Health behaviors, such as dietary practices, vary within Asian and Latino subgroups 25 and thus require different interventions and may lead to different health outcomes6,7; and 26 27 Whereas, Accurate preferred language data can help identify \"hot-spot\" geographic areas with a 28 high density of morbidity and could facilitate addressing soci al determinants of health8; and 29 30 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 29 (A-19) Page 2 of 7 Whereas, A 2017 randomized controlled trial and retrospective study at an inner -city pain clinic 1 demonstrated improved adherence to treatment and attendance at scheduled appointments 2 after an intervention was deployed that utilized accurate preferred language data9,10; and 3 4 Whereas, Race, ethnicity, and language (REL) and other socio -demographic data c ould be 5 used to identify targeted interventions for high -risk patients or areas for quality improvement11,12; 6 and 7 8 Whereas, Despite recognition that such data can improve care, reliable collecti on of REL is 9 uncommon, even in settings that treat large minority and immigrant populations8,11-13; and 10 11 Whereas, Several successful systems -level interventions with evidence of improved screening 12 for accurate REL data have been published to date12,14; and 13 14 Whereas, Existing guidelines for electronic health record (EHR) collection of REL data have led 15 to inaccuracies that could reduce the effectiveness of interventions based on this data13; and 16 17 Whereas, Our AMA has supported reducing racial and ethnic disparities in health care by 18 studying health system opportunities and barriers to eliminating disparities (D-350.995); and 19 20 Whereas, Our AMA has advocated for precision in racial, ethnic, and religious designations in 21 medical records, but has not done so for preferred language (H -315.996); and 22 23 Whereas, Our AMA has supported the collection of disaggregated racial data, but current policy 24 lacks actionable language to engage stakeholders (H -350.954); therefore, be it 25 26 RESOLVED, T hat our AMA amend policy H -315.996 by insertion as follows: 27 28 Accuracy in Racial, Ethnic , Lingual, and Religious Designations in Medical 29 Records, H -315.996 30 The AMA advocates precision in racial, ethnic , preferred language, and religious 31 designations in me dical records, with information obtained from the patient, always 32 respecting the personal privacy of the patient. 33 34 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H-350.954 by deletion and insertion as follows: 35 36 Disaggregation of Demographic Data Within Racial and Ethnic Groups, H -350.954 37 Our AMA supports encourages the disaggregation of demographic data regarding : (1) 38 Asian -Americans and Pacific Islanders in order to reveal the within -group disparities that 39 exist in health outcomes and representation in medicine; and (2) racial and ethnic 40 groups , including but not limited to American Indian/Alaska Native (AIAN); Asian, Native 41 Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI); Latinx; Hispanic White; non -Hispanic White; 42 and Black/African American populations in order to reveal t he disparities in health 43 Resolution 29 (A-19) Page 3 of 7 outcomes and representation in medicine that exist within current classifications of racial 1 and ethnic groups. that exist in health outcomes and representation in medicine . 2 3 RESOLVED, That our AMA will encourage the Office of the National Coordinator for Health 4 Information Technology (ONC) to expand their data collection requirements, such that electronic 5 health record (EHR) vendors include options for disaggregated coding of race and ethnicity. 6 Fiscal note: Date received: 04/21/19 UC.

Improving the provision of language services at an academic medical center: ensuring high -quality health communication for limited -English -proficient Disaggregation of Demographic Data Within Ethnic Groups H -350.954 Our AMA supports the disaggregation of demographic data regarding: (1) Asian -Americans and Pacific Islanders in order to reveal the within -group di sparities that exist in health outcomes and representation in medicine; and (2) ethnic groups in order to reveal the within -group disparities that exist in health outcomes and representation in medicine. National Health Information Technology D -478.995 1. Our AMA will closely coordinate with the newly formed Office of the National Health Information Technology Coordinator all efforts necessary to expedite the implementation of an interoperable health information technology infrastructure, while minimizing the financial burden to the physician and maintaining the art of medicine without compromising patient care. 2. Our AMA: (A) advocates for standardization of key elements of electronic health record (EHR) and computerized physician order entry (CPOE) user interface design during the ongoing development of this technology; (B) advocates that medical facilities and health systems work toward standardized login procedures and parameters to reduce user login fatigue; and (C) advocates for continued research and physician education on EHR and CPOE user interface design specifically concerning key design principles and features that can improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care; and (D) advocates for continued research on EHR, CPOE and clinical de cision support systems and vendor accountability for the efficacy, effectiveness, and safety of these systems. 3. Our AMA will request that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: (A) support an external, independent evaluation of the effect of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) implementation on patient safety and on the productivity and financial solvency of hospitals and physicians' practices; and (B) develop, with physician input, minimum standards to be applied to outcome -based initiatives meas ured during this rapid implementation phase of EMRs. 4. Our AMA will (A) seek legislation or regulation to require all EHR vendors to utilize standard and interoperable software technology components to enable cost efficient use of electronic health record s across all health care delivery systems including institutional and community based settings of care delivery; and (B) work with CMS to incentivize hospitals and health systems to achieve interconnectivity and interoperability of electronic health record s systems with independent physician practices to enable the efficient and cost effective use and sharing of electronic health records across all settings of care delivery. 5. Our AMA will seek to incorporate incremental steps to achieve electronic health record (EHR) data portability as part of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology's (ONC) certification process. 6. Our AMA will collaborate with EHR vendors and other stakeholders to enhance transparency and establish proce sses to achieve data portability. Resolution 29 (A-19) Page 5 of 7 7. Our AMA will directly engage the EHR vendor community to promote improvements in EHR usability. 8. Our AMA will advocate for appropriate, effective, and less burdensome documentation requirements in the use of electroni c health records. 9. Our AMA will urge EHR vendors to adopt social determinants of health templates, created with input from our AMA, medical specialty societies, and other stakeholders with expertise in social determinants of health metrics and developmen t, without adding further cost or documentation burden for physicians. Hospital Surveys and Health Care Disparities H -450.924 Our AMA supports that the goal of hospital quality program assessments should be to identify areas to improve patient outcomes an d quality of patient care. Our AMA recognizes the importance of cultural competency to patient experience and treatment plan adherence and encourage the implementation of cultural competency practices across health care settings. Sharing Demographic Medi care Data with Other Public Entities by CMS H -330.934 The AMA supports continued provision of aggregate anonymous demographic information to state and local health agencies where its use will promote community health and improve utilization of health care dollars, as long as adequate safeguards to protect individual privacy are preserved. Accuracy in Racial, Ethnic and Religious Designations in Medical Records H -315.996 The AMA advocates precision in racial, ethnic and religious designations in medical re cords, with information obtained from the patient, always respecting the personal privacy of the patient. Race and Ethnicity as Variables in Medical Research H -460.924 Our AMA policy is that: (1) race and ethnicity are valuable research variables when use d and interpreted appropriately; (2) health data be collected on patients, by race and ethnicity, in hospitals, managed care organizations, independent practice associations, and other large insurance organizations; (3) physicians recognize that race and e thnicity are conceptually distinct; (4) our AMA supports research into the use of methodologies that allow for multiple racial and ethnic self -designations by research participants; (5) our AMA encourages investigators to recognize the limitations of all current methods for classifying race and ethnic groups in all medical studies by stating explicitly how race and/or ethnic taxonomies were developed or selected; (6) our AMA encourages appropriate organizations to apply the results from studies of race - ethnicity and health to the planning and evaluation of health services; and (7) our AMA continues to monitor developments in the field of racial and ethnic classification so that it can assist physicians in interpreting these findings and their implications f or health care for patients. Resolution 29 (A-19) Page 6 of 7 Reducing Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care D-350.995 Our AMA's initiative on reducing racial and ethnic disparities in health care will include the following recommendations:(1) Studying health system opportunities and barriers to eliminating racial and ethnic disparities in health care.(2) Working with public health and other appropriate agencies to increase medical student, resident physician, and practicing physician awareness of racial and ethnic disparities in health care and the role of professionalism and professional obligations in efforts to reduce health care disparities.(3) Promoting diversity within the profession by encouraging publication of successful outreach programs that increase minority applicants to medical schools, and take appropriate action to support such programs, for example, by expanding the \"Doctors Back to School\" program into secondary schools in minority communities. (BOT Rep. 4, A -03; Reaffirmation A -11) Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health Care H -350.974 Our AMA recognizes racial and ethnic health disparities as a major public health problem in the United States and as a barrier to effective medical diagnosis and treatment. The AMA maintains a position of zero tolerance toward raci ally or culturally based disparities in care; encourages individuals to report physicians to local medical societies where racial or ethnic discrimination is suspected; and will continue to support physician cultural awareness initiatives and related consu mer education activities. The elimination of racial and ethnic disparities in health care an issue of highest priority for the American Medical Association. The AMA emphasizes three approaches that it believes should be given high priority: (1) Greater acc ess - the need for ensuring that black Americans without adequate health care insurance are given the means for access to necessary health care. In particular, it is urgent that Congress address the need for Medicaid reform. (2) Greater awareness - racial disparities may be occurring despite the lack of any intent or purposeful efforts to treat patients differently on the basis of race. The AMA encourages physicians to examine their own practices to ensure that inappropriate considerations do not affect the ir clinical judgment. In addition, the profession should help increase the awareness of its members of racial disparities in medical treatment decisions by engaging in open and broad discussions about the issue. Such discussions should take place in medica l school curriculum, in medical journals, at professional conferences, and as part of professional peer review activities. (3) Practice parameters - the racial disparities in access to treatment indicate that inappropriate considerations may enter the deci sion making process. The efforts of the specialty societies, with the coordination and assistance of our AMA, to develop practice parameters, should include criteria that would preclude or diminish racial disparities. Our AMA encourages the development of evidence -based performance measures that adequately identify socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in quality. Furthermore, our AMA supports the use of evidence -based guidelines to promote the consistency and equity of care for all persons. Disaggre gation of Data Concerning the Status of Asian -Americans 350.017MSS Resolution 29 (A-19) Page 7 of 7 AMA -MSS will ask that our AMA support the disaggregation of data regarding Asian -Americans in order to reveal the within -group disparities that exist in health outcomes and representation i n medicine. (MSS Res 27, A -17) Evaluation of the Principles of the Health Care Access Resolution 165.009MSS (1) AMA -MSS supports efforts to make health care more cost -effective by reducing administrative burdens, but only to such a degree that quality of care is not compromised; (2) AMA -MSS supports means of including both long -term care and prescription drug benefits into the guidelines for seeking affordable universal health care access and coverage; (3) AMA -MSS encourages the development of evidence -based performance measures that adequately identify socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities in quality of health care; and that our AMA -MSS supports the use of evidence -based guidelines to promote the consistency and equity of care for all persons; (4) A MA-MSS will adopt policy to promote outcomes research as an effective mechanism to improve the quality of medical care for all persons and urge that the results of such research be used only for educational purposes and for improving practice parameters; ( 5) AMA -MSS will adopt policy to address the need to increase numbers of qualified health care professionals, practitioners, and providers in underserved areas to increase timely access to quality care; (6) AMA -MSS supports the inclusion of adequate and tim ely payments to physicians and other providers into any plan calling for affordable universal health care access; (7) AMA -MSS supports the inclusion of the principles of continuity of health insurance coverage and continuity of medical care into any plan c alling for affordable universal health care access; (8)AMA -MSS supports the inclusion of the principle of consumer choice of healthcare providers and practitioners into any plan calling for affordable universal health care access; (9) AMA -MSS supports the inclusion of reducing health care administrative cost and burden into any plan calling for affordable universal health care access.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POL ICY Definitions of \"Cosmetic\" and \"Reconstructive\" Surgery H -475.992 Our AMA: (1) supports the following definitions of \"cosmetic\" and \"reconstructive\" surgery: Cosmetic surgery is performed to reshape normal structures of the body in order to improve the patient's appearance and self -esteem. Reconstructive surgery is performed on abnormal structures of the body, caused by congenital defects, developmental abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors or disease. It is generally performed to improve function, but may also be done to approximate a normal appearance. (2) Our AMA encourages third party payers to use these definitions in determining services eligible for coverage under the plans they offer or administer. Preventing, Identifying and Trea ting Violence and Abuse Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 8.10 All patients may be at risk for interpersonal violence and abuse, which may adversely affect their health or ability to adhere to medical recommendations. In light of their obligation to promote t he well-being of patients, physicians have an ethical obligation to take appropriate action to avert the harms caused by violence and abuse.

Prison -Based Treatment Programs for Drug Abuse H -430.994 Our AMA: (1) encourages the increased application to the prison setting of the principles, precepts and processes derived from drug -free residential therapeutic community experience; and (2) urges state health departments or other appropriate agencies to take the lead in working with correction and substance abuse agencies for the expansion of such prison -based drug -free treatment programs. Opiate Replacement Therapy Programs in Correctional Facilities H -430.987 1. Our AMA endorses: (a) the medical treatment model of employing opiate replacement therapy (ORT) as an effective therapy in treating opia te-addicted persons who are incarcerated; and (b) ORT for opiate -addicted persons who are incarcerated, in collaboration with the National Commission on Correctional Health Care and the American Society of Addiction Medicine. 2. Our AMA advocates for legi slation, standards, policies and funding that encourage correctional facilities to increase access to evidence -based treatment of opioid use disorder, including initiation and continuation of opioid replacement therapy in conjunction with counseling, in co rrectional facilities within the United States and that this apply to all incarcerated individuals including pregnant women. 3. Our AMA supports legislation, standards, policies, and funding that encourage correctional facilities within the United States to work in ongoing collaboration with addiction treatment physician -led teams, case managers, social workers, and pharmacies in the communities where patients, including pregnant women, are released to offer post -incarceration treatment plans for opioid us e disorder, including education, medication for addiction treatment and counseling, and medication for preventing overdose deaths and help ensure post -incarceration medical coverage and accessibility to medication assisted therapy. Bonding Programs for Women Prisoners and their Newborn Children H -430.990 Because there are insufficient data at this time to draw conclusions about the long -term effects of prison nursery programs on mothers and their children, the AMA supports and encourages further research on the impact of infant bonding programs on incarcerated women and their children. The AMA recognizes the prevalence of mental health and substance abuse problems among incarcerated women and continues to support access to appropriate services for women in prisons. The AMA recognizes that a large majority of female inmates who may not have developed appropriate parenting skills are mothers of children under the age of 18. The AMA encourages correctional facilities to provide parenting skills training to al l female inmates in preparation for their release from prison and return to their children. The AMA supports and encourages further investigation into the long -term effects of prison nurseries on mothers and their children.

and 3 4 Whereas, High-end emissions projection scenarios show global average warming of 2.6 -4.8\u00b0C 5 by the end of the century, with all their regional amplification and attendant impacts2; and 6 7 Whereas, There is widespread agreement in the literature reviewed by the Intergovernmental 8 Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that remaining below 1.5\u00b0C warming would entail 9 \"significantly greater transformation in terms of energy systems, lifestyles and investment 10 patterns compared to 2\u00b0C\"3; and 11 12 Whereas, the IPCC has estimated that limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C would require \"global 13 net human -caused emissions of carbon dioxide to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 14 2030, and reach net zero by approximately 2050\"3; and 15 16 Whereas, Climate change related health costs in the US are projected to be approximately 5 0% 17 less per year when global climate is prevented from exceeding 1.5\u00b0C 4,5; and 18 19 Whereas, More than 50% of heat related deaths and approximately 50% of infectious diseases 20 cases can be prevented in the US when global climate is prevented from exceeding 1.5 \u00b0C4; and 21 22 Whereas, When global warming exceeds 1.5\u00b0C above pre -industrial levels, the estimated global 23 effects include 92,207 additional heat -related deaths per year by 2030, 350 million more 24 humans exposed to severe heat by 2050, and 31 to 69 million huma ns exposed to flooding from 25 sea level rise by 21003,6; and 26 27 Whereas, Compared to at 1.5\u00b0C global warming, at 2\u00b0C, the estimated global effects include 28 255,486 additional heat -related deaths by 2050, 25 million more malnourished people, 165 29 million more ca ses of Dengue fever per year, 150 million more cases of malaria, up to 10 30 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 33 (A-19) Page 2 of 6 million more humans exposed to flooding from sea level rise, and 153 million more premature 1 deaths caused by pollution by 21006,7-10;

and 11 12 Whereas, Previous extr eme weather and climate events have significantly increased healthcare 13 spending, as evidenced by six events across the United States between 2000 and 2009 that 14 increased spending by over $14 billion through 760,000 additional patient encounters and 1,689 15 lives lost prematurely15; and 16 17 Whereas, Current climate projections would cost the US healthcare system an additional $1 18 billion and $3.3 billion per year by 2050 and 2090 respectively in West Nile Virus -related 19 management, $141 billion per year in heat -related deaths, and $26 billion per year in poor air - 20 quality deaths by 21004,16; and 21 22 Whereas, The US healthcare system alone is responsible for 10% of US greenhouse gas 23 emissions, and if it were its own country, it would be the 7th largest producer of carbon dioxide 24 in the world17,18; and 25 26 Whereas, A number of US academic and private medical centers, as well as international 27 medical systems, have taken steps to improve energy -efficiency, expand recycling 28 programs,and pursue energy independence, demons trating the feasibility of reducing energy 29 expenditures while saving money within the healthcare sector19-23 ;

Res. 205, A -16 Long -Term Care R esidents With Criminal Backgrounds H -280.948 1. Our AMA encourages the long -term care provider and correctional care communities, including the American Medical Directors Association, the Society of Correctional Physicians, the National Commission on Corre ctional Health Care, the American Psychiatric Association, long-term care advocacy groups and offender advocacy groups, to work together to develop national best practices on how best to provide care to, and develop appropriate care plans for, individuals with violent criminal backgrounds or violent tendencies in long -term care facilities while ensuring the safety of all residents of the facilities. 2. Our AMA encourages more research on how to best care for residents of long -term care facilities with cri minal backgrounds, which should include how to vary approaches to care planning and risk management based on age of offense, length of incarceration, violent tendencies, and medical and psychiatric history. 3. Our AMA encourages research to identify and appropriately address possible liabilities for medical directors, attending physicians, and other providers in long -term care facilities caring for residents with criminal backgrounds. 4. Our AMA will urge the Society of Correctional Physicians and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care to work to develop policies and guidelines on how to transition to long - term care facilities for individuals recently released from incarceration, with consideration to length of incarceration, violent tenden cies, and medical and psychiatric history.

Care Needs of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer Populations 1. Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identit ies enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific hea lth care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of edu cational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) work ing with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender minority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individuals) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their cisgender, heteros exual peers and may have unique complicating factors. 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collab orate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up -to- date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people. Resolution 36 (A-19) Page 5 of 6 H-65.967 Confor ming birth certificate policies to current medical standards for transgender patients 1. Our AMA supports policies that allow for a change of sex designation on birth certificates for transgender individuals based upon verification by a physician (MD or D O) that the individual has undergone gender transition according to applicable medical standards of care. 2. Our AMA: (a) supports elimination of any requirement that individuals undergo gender affirmation surgery in order to change their sex designation o n birth certificates and supports modernizing state vital statistics statutes to ensure accurate gender markers on birth certificates; and (b) supports that any change of sex designation on an individual's birth certificate not hinder access to medically a ppropriate preventive care. H-315.967 Promoting Inclusive Gender, Sex, and Sexual Orientation Options on Medical Documentation Our AMA: (1) supports the voluntary inclusion of a patient's biological sex, current gender identity, sexual orientation, and preferred gender pronoun(s) in medical documentation and related forms, including in electronic health records, in a culturally -sensitive and voluntary manner; and (2) will advocate for collection of patient data that is inclusive of sexual orientation/gen der identity for the purposes of research into patient health. 65.012MSS Removing Barriers to Care for Transgender Patients AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to (1) support public and private health insurance coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults; and (2) oppose categorical exclusions of coverage for treatment of gender dysphoria in adolescents and adults when prescribed by a physician.

Subject: Support Expansion of Good Samaritan Laws Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , In 2016, drug overdoses killed 63,632 Americans and the leading cause of 1 preventable death in the USA1-3; and 2 3 Whereas, Opioi d overdose can be effectively reversed using the opioid antagonist naloxone4,5; 4 and 5 6 Whereas, Between 21 -68% of overdose bystanders call 911, but many delay or refrain from 7 calling 911 altogether often due to fear of arrest6,7; and 8 9 Whereas, Whereas, 46 states have passed some form of a \"Good Samaritan Law\" (GSL) as 10 endorsed by our AMA (D -95.977) to provide limited immunity from drug -related offenses to 11 people who seek medical assistance in the event of an overdose8; and 12 13 Whereas, Many people who use drugs are not aware these laws exists, one study found that 14 two thirds of those surveyed were unaware of GSLs6; and 15 16 Whereas, A study in New York found that bystanders with a correct understanding of GSLs 17 were 3 times more likely to call 911 in the event of an overdose than those who had incorrect 18 knowledge about GSLs9; and 19 20 Whereas, GSLs provide variable legal protection by state, which may confer protection against 21 prosecution for specific crimes such as th e possession of illicit/controlled substances, 22 paraphernalia, and/or parole/pretrial/probation violations6,10,11; and 23 24 Whereas, A drug -induced homicide is defined as a crime in which a person delivered or 25 provided drugs to another person that resulted in their death12; and 26 27 Whereas, GSLs do not provide protections for drug -induced homicide7,13; and 28 29 Whereas, Only Vermont and Delaware have specific laws th at provide immunity for drug - 30 induced homicide if a person seeks medical assistance10; and 31 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 37 (A-19) Page 2 of 6 1 Whereas, Some states have enacted \"911 Medical Amnesty Laws\" to protect individuals from 2 arrest, prosecution or conviction of certain drug offenses if the evidence results from seeking 3 medical assistance for someone though t to be suffering from a drug overdose14; and 4 5 Whereas, The enactment of aforementioned medical amnesty policie s in cases of underage 6 drinking have been shown to not increase consumption15; and 7 8 Whereas, As of 2016 there 40 states had implemented medical amnesty laws protecting minors 9 in alcohol related emergencies16; and 10 11 Whereas, Implementation of Medical Amnesty Protocols (MAP) did not result in increased 12 drinking, overall consumption, or the incidence of physiological consequences17; and 13 14 Whereas, After the creation of MAP, Cornell students showed an increased willingness to seek 15 help for alcohol related emergencies, and there was a 61% decrease in the students who cited 16 fear of getting in trouble as the reason they did not call for help15; and 17 18 Whereas, The number of prosecutions of drug -induced homicide across the country has 19 increased over 300% since 2011, with the Midwest accounting for a lar ge portion of this 20 increase; family members, friends, and partners are the frequent victims of these 21 prosecutions10,18-20; and 22 23 Whereas, Increases in drug -induc ed homicide prosecutions are correlated with increases in 24 fatal overdose rates and studies suggest this may be due to increased fear of calling for 25 help7,10,18; and 26 27 Whereas, Research suggests that a lack of Good Samaritan laws can lead to conditions in 28 which there are higher opioid -related deaths and decreased medical interventions \u2014 29 representing a real public health concern21; therefore be it 30 31 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for the expansion of Good Samaritan Laws and 32 development of 911 Medical Amnesty Laws nationally to ensure that any person who in good 33 faith seeks medical assistance for a person experiencing or believed to be experiencing a drug 34 overdose or who is experiencing a drug overdose him or herself shall not be arrested, charged, 35 or prosecuted for a drug violation, including b ut not limited to: possession, parole violations, and 36 drug-induced homicide, if the evidence for the arrest, charge, or prosecution of such drug 37 violation resulted solely from seeking such medical assistance ; and be it further 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA amen d policy D -95.977 by insertion as follows : 40 41 911 Good Samaritan Laws , D-95.977 42 Our AMA: (1) will support and endorse policies and legislation that provide protections 43 from prosecution for any drug -related crime for callers or witnesses seeking medical he lp 44 for overdose victims; and (2) will promote 911 Good Samaritan policies through 45 legislative or regulatory advocacy at the local, state, and national level; and (3) will work 46 Resolution 37 (A-19) Page 3 of 6 with the relevant organizations and state societies to develop campaigns to rais e 1 awaren ess about the existence and scop e of Good Samaritan Laws . 2 3 Fiscal Note: Significant, 12 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 39 (A-19) Introduced by: Lavanya Easwaran, Molly Benoit, University of Miami Subject: Support of Visual Aids Covered by Medicaid and Further Research in Proper Eye Practices Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , The number of people with blindness and low vision problems is proposed to reach 1 5.5 million by 2020, which is why vision health continues to be a top priority in public health 2 policy and part of Healthy People 20201; and 3 4 Whereas, The American Academy o f Ophthalmology recommends that adults get a complete 5 eye examination at age 402 and those with history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or family 6 history of eye disease should get a complete eye examination before the age of 402; and 7 8 Whereas, Early signs of age -related eye diseases (e.g. cataract , glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, 9 age-related macular degeneration) can be gin in midlife but do not noticeably impact vision until 10 later3; and 11 12 Whereas, Vision impairment impacts individuals' a bility to work or care for the themselves and 13 can affect casual activities such as reading, socializing, and pursuit of hobbies4; and 14 15 Whereas, Vision impairment increases the difficulty of performing basic self -care activities of 16 daily living (e.g. eating, dressing) and instrumental activities of daily living (e.g. shopping, 17 financial management, medication management, driving)4,5; and 18 19 Whereas, The CDC has noted that vision health dispa rities disproportionately affect those in the 20 lowest socioeconomic class and those most likely to qualify for benefits from Medicaid6. The 21 odds of vision impairment for patients from poor and low income backgrounds were 1.35 and 22 1.28 respectively as compar ed to patients from a higher socioeconomic position7 and 23 24 Whereas, Medicaid users had decreased odds of 0.41 in successfully obtaining an eye care 25 appointment as compared to those commercial health insurance8; and 26 27 Whereas Those with Medicaid coverage we re 234% more likely to not receive any glaucoma 28 testing after initial testing as compared to those with commercial health insurance9; and 29 30 Whereas, The estimated annual total financial burden of major adult visual disorders is $35.4 31 billion ($16.2 billion in direct medical costs, $11.1 billion in other direct costs, and and $8 billion 32 in productivity loses)10; and 33 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 39 (A-19) Page 2 of 4 1 Whereas, The quality adjusted life years of routine glaucoma assessments and early treatment 2 is $46,000 gained as compared to no routine assessm ent and no treatment11; and 3 4 Whereas, 55% of patients in need of prescription lenses were not able to obtain them and the 5 most frequent cause was lack of financial ability12; and 6 7 Whereas, Only thirty -three states offer optional, limited Medicaid coverage of eyeglasses and 8 other visual aids. Many only offer these benefits to children and those with severe eye 9 conditions (i.e aphakia)13; and 10 11 Whereas, Routine eye examinations in asymptomatic patients lead to the discovery at least one 12 significant change in eye health for 58% of patients and 16% of patients have a new critical 13 diagnoses14 yet the USPSTF states current evidence is insufficient to recommend routine eye 14 screenings in adults15. 15 16 Whereas, Even mild vision deficits can have a significant impact on quality of life, the increased 17 risk for those in lower socioeconomic classes and lack of vision coverage to have vision deficits 18 decreases their ability to be independent and having vision deficits lead to barriers in 19 employment resulting in decreased a bility to support family ; therefore be it 20 21 RESOLVED, That our AMA support policy that supports coverage of vision screenings and 22 visual aids as well as support further research into the benefits of routine comprehensive eye 23 exams 24 25 Fiscal Note: Moderate, 9 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: Click here to enter references.

(2) in order to limit patient churn and assure continuity and coordination of care, there should be adoption of 12 -month continuous eligibility across Medicaid, Children's Health Insurance Program, and exchange plans. (3) to support the development of a safety net mechanism, allow for the presumptive assessment of eligibility and retroactive coverage to the time at which an eligible person seeks medical care. (4) tax credit beneficiaries should be given a choice of coverage, and that a mechanism be developed to administer a process by which those who do not choose a health plan will be assigned a plan in their geographic area through auto -enrollment until the next enrollment opportunity. Patients who have been aut o-enrolled should be permitted to change plans any time within 90 days of their original enrollment. (5) state public health or social service programs should cover, at least for a transitional period, those benefits that would otherwise be available unde r Medicaid, but are not medical benefits per se. (6) as the nonelderly and nondisabled populations transition into needing chronic care, they should be eligible for sufficient additional subsidization based on health status to allow them to maintain their current coverage. (7) our AMA encourages the development of pilot projects or state demonstrations, including for children, incorporating the above recommendations. (Modify Current HOD Policy) (8) our AMA should encourage states to support a Medicaid Ph ysician Advisory Commission to evaluate and monitor access to care in the state Medicaid program and related pilot projects. Encouraging Vision Screening for Schoolchildren 60.010 MSS AMA -MSS will ask the AMA to: (1) encourage and support outreach efforts to provide vision screenings for school -age children prior to primary school enrollment and (2) encourage the development of programs to improve school readiness by detecting undiagnos ed vision problems and support periodic pediatric eye screenings with referral for comprehensive professional evaluation as appropriate.

(2) Where school -based services exist, the AMA recommends tha t they meet the following minimum standards: (a) Health services in schools must be supervised by a physician, preferably one who is experienced in the care of children and adolescents. Additionally, a physician should be accessible to administer care on a regular basis. (b) On -site services should be provided by a professionally prepared school nurse or similarly qualified health professional. Expertise in child and adolescent development, psychosocial and behavioral problems, and emergency care is desirab le. Responsibilities of this professional would include coordinating the health care of students with the student, the parents, the school and the student's personal physician and assisting with the development and presentation of health education programs in the classroom. (c) There should be a written policy to govern provision of health services in the school. Such a policy should be developed by a school health council consisting of school and community -based physicians, nurses, school faculty and admin istrators, parents, and (as appropriate) students, community leaders and others. Health services and curricula should be carefully designed to reflect community standards and values, while emphasizing positive health practices in the school environment. (d ) Before patient services begin, policies on confidentiality should be established with the advice of expert legal advisors and the school health council. (e) Policies for ongoing monitoring, quality assurance and evaluation should be established with the advice of expert legal advisors and the school health council. (f) Health care services should be available during school hours. During other hours, an appropriate referral system should be instituted. (g) School -based health programs Resolution 40 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 should draw on outsid e resources for care, such as private practitioners, public health and mental health clinics, and mental health and neighborhood health programs. (h) Services should be coordinated to ensure comprehensive care. Parents should be encouraged to be intimately involved in the health supervision and education of their children. CSA Rep.

Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well as in illness. In the case of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning, and other (LGBTQ) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBTQ; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) e ducating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBTQ Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing me dical education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBTQ patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in LGBTQ Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the health care needs of LGBTQ people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBTQ communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand the medical needs of LGBTQ patients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for sexual and gender mi nority individuals to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings based on anatomy due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in me n who have sex with men; (iii) appropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases; and (iv) that individuals who identify as a sexual and/or gender minority (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer/questioning individual s) experience intimate partner violence, and how sexual and gender minorities present with intimate partner violence differs from their cisgender, heterosexual peers and may have unique complicating factors. 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBTQ health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to explore opportunities to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up -to- date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to LGBTQ people.

and 4 5 Whereas, Persons with pedophilic disorder may not necessarily engage in sexual crimes 6 towards children and pe rsons who engage in these crimes may not necessarily have pedophilic 7 disorder3,4; and 8 9 Whereas, Current estimates of the incidence of pedophilic urges in the general population range 10 between 3% to more than 20%, but most with these urges do not act upon t hem4,5; and 11 12 Whereas, Persons who are convicted of sexual offenses, including sexual crimes towards 13 children, are required to register on a sex offender registry and follow requirements such as 14 following up with the local police department and keeping curr ent information updated on the 15 public registry regarding their address and place of employment6,7; and 16 17 Whereas, The Office of Sex Offender Sentencing, Monitoring, Apprehending (SORNA) 18 guidelines determine guidelines regarding minimum and required standard s for sex offender 19 registration and notification; individual jurisdictions may enhance/increase these requirements, 20 but not decrease them8; and 21 22 Whereas, Persons who are convicted of nonviolent misdemeanor sex crimes generally have a 23 15-year minimum requir ement to be registered on the sex offender list6; and 24 25 Whereas, Some states including California and South Carolina require a person convicted of 26 any sex crime (including non -violent misdemeanors) to be placed on the sex offender registry 27 for life7; and 28 29 Whereas, Many people who self -identify as pedophiles want to seek help but feel unable to due 30 to fear of being reported9,10,11; and 31 32 Whereas, Those who have not yet acted on their urges who attempt to seek help are often 33 turned away by professionals who are either unwilling or not sufficiently trained to help12; and 34 35 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 41 (A-19) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, Psychiatrists are bound by certain legal and ethical obligations that require them to 1 report a patient who expresses a desire to harm another person; the most famous of these laws 2 is the Tarasoff law which states that when there is a threat of danger, the duty to warn trumps 3 patient confidentiality13,14; and 4 5 Whereas, All physicians are also mandated reporters of suspected current or potential child 6 abuse, a category which includes child neglect and sexual, physical and psychological 7 abuse15,16; and 8 9 Whereas, The AMA Medical Code of Ethics calls for maintaining confidentiality unless situations 10 arise when breaking confidentiality is justified17; and 11 12 Whereas, The specific language of these mandated reporting guidelines in at least one state 13 (New York) is ambiguous enough that some medical professionals feel obligated to report even 14 pedophilic desires without intended action10; and 15 16 Whereas, A public education program called 'Stop It Now' aims to prevent child sexual abuse by 17 targeting bystanders; however, the warning signs discussed to identify an adult who may harm a 18 child are ambiguous and include concerns with that person's 'relationships, sexual interactions, 19 and personal safety/ responsibility' including vague examples like missing social cues about 20 others' personal limits and abusing alcohol or drugs18; and 21 22 Whereas, Given the unspecific nature of codes of ethics as well as the ambiguous reporting 23 guidelines, it is warranted to introduce policy to precisely state certain recommendations for the 24 benefit of this population18; and 25 26 Whereas, Current AMA policy H -345.981 broadly identifies the importance of decreasing stigma 27 regarding mental illness, but does not emphasize nor specify the significance of prophylactic 28 treatment in patient populations with destructive desires to protect patients as well as others; 29 and 30 31 Whereas, Although c urrent AMA policy (H -345.981, H -345.983, and H -345.984) broadly 32 supports protections regarding mental health and the nuances of the physician -patient 33 relationship the specific needs of the population of patients with pedophilic disorder - and the 34 potential to intervene before harm is done to others - policy specifically designed to protect this 35 population would help to disseminate the intense stigma of pedophilic disorders; and 36 37 Whereas, Support groups exist (such as Virtuous Pedophiles) that include as many as 1,200 38 members seeking professional help in resisting their sexual impulses as they face isolatio n, self - 39 loathing, and suicidal thoughts, and testimonies from members further denote their hesitation to 40 seek therapy due to fear of current reporting laws11,19,20,21; and 41 42 Whereas, Circles of Support and Accountability in Canada has trained volunteers to act as peer 43 support, offering confidential therapy and support for offenders; this program resulted in a 70% 44 reduction in sexual recidivism and 82% reduction in offending22; and 45 46 Whereas, 'Stop It Now' campaigns geared toward confidential conversation and support for 47 offending and non -offending persons with pedophilic disorder in the UK and Ireland saw a 41% 48 increase in utilization from 2016 to 2017, including 2,251 persons calling the help hotline with 49 concern about their own behavior or that of a family m ember in 201723; and 50 51 Resolution 41 (A-19) Page 3 of 5 Whereas, A study of the Prevention Project Dunkelfield in Germany which offers non - 1 judgmental, confidential therapy and libido reducing medication for offending and non -offending 2 individuals showed that over half of participants were non -offenders, had sought professional 3 help previously and never had contact with a minor8; and 4 5 Whereas, Several drug -based therapies - including androgen deprivation therapy and selective 6 serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - have been shown positive results in treating pedophilic 7 offenders and non -offenders8,24,25; and 8 9 Where as, Several drug -based therapies - including androgen deprivation therapy and selective 10 serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) - have been shown positive results in treating pedophilic 11 offenders and non -offender s26,27; therefore be it 12 13 RESOLVED, That our AMA support the development of clear reporting guidelines for physicians 14 confidentially treating patients with pedophilic desires who have not acted on these urge s; and 15 be it further 16 17 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for increased training and awa reness for physicians about 18 the incidence of these pedophilic desires in the general population and potential preventive 19 treatment options; and be it further 20 21 RESOLVED, That our AMA support confidential preventive treatment of people with pedophilic 22 desire s who have not acted on these urges. 23 24 Fiscal Note: Significant, 12 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

Access to Mental Health Services H -345.981 Our AMA advocates the following steps to remove barriers that keep Americans from seeking and obtaining treatment for mental illness: (1) reducing the stigma of mental illness by dispelling myths and providing accurate knowledge to ensure a more informed public; (2) improving public awareness of effective treatment for mental illness; (3) ensuring the supply of psychiatrists and other well trained mental health professionals, especially in rural areas and those serving children and adolescents; (4) tailoring diagnosis and treatment of mental illne ss to age, gender, race, culture and other characteristics that shape a person's identity; (5) facilitating entry into treatment by first -line contacts recognizing mental illness, and making proper referrals and/or to addressing problems effectively themse lves; and (6) reducing financial barriers to treatment. Protection of Health Care Providers from Unintended Legal Consequences of HIPAA D - 190.983 Our AMA will: (1) take appropriate legislative, regulatory, and/or legal action to assure that the unanticipa ted negative consequences of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy regulations, affecting the patient/doctor relationship and exposing health care providers to legal action, are corrected; and (2) initiate necessary legislative, r egulatory, and/or legal action to assure that HIPAA violations that are not malicious in intent and are not directly related to any alleged act of medical negligence may not be attached to such litigation. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 42 (A-19) Introduced by: Region 1 Subject: Addressing the Racial Pay Gap in Medicine Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez, Chair) Whereas, The Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or 1 national origin1; and 2 3 Whereas, The racial wage gap persists across the labor market in the United States, meaning 4 that people of color earn less than their white counterparts in the same professions, conducting 5 the same work, with the same education and experience2; and 6 7 Wherea s, The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a worsening of the racial pay gap. In 1979 8 black men earne d 80% of what white men earned, compared to 2016 black men earn 70% of 9 what white men earn3; and 10 11 Whereas, The American College of Physicians has shown that after controlling for age, sex, 12 race, hours worked, and state of residence, Black physicians made $194,444 annually, 13 compared to $228,585 for White physicians - a difference of $34,144; and 14 15 Whereas, Black male physicians earn substantially less than white male physicians after 16 adjustment for physician specialty practice characteristics, age, and hours worked; and black 17 female physicians earn even less than their black male counterpart with adjustments accounting 18 for characteristics of physician and pract ice5; and 19 20 Whereas, White female physicians made 19 percent and Black female physicians made 29 21 percent less than their white male counterparts after controlling for hours worked, years of 22 practice, practice ownership status, board certification status, IMG status, type of degree, 23 demographics of practice, and proportion of Medicare and Medicaid patients5; and 24 25 Whereas, Black male physicians are more likely to work in primary care and to treat Medicaid 26 patients compared with white male physicians, adjustm ent for these and other practice 27 characteristics, does not eliminate, or even significantly reduce, the estimated differences in 28 earnings5; and 29 30 Whereas, A study of 128 academic medical centers found that Black or Hispanic faculty 31 constituted only 5% of new academic hires and had significantly longer promotion timelines 32 when compared to their white counterparts, after factors such as gender, tenure status, degree, 33 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 42 (A-19) Page 2 of 4 and NIH award status were adjusted for. Underrepresented minority (URM) faculty were still 1 less likely to be promoted at all levels6; therefore be it 2 3 RESOLVED , That our AMA support measures of racial pay awareness and the specific 4 challenges that minority physicians face in regards to equal pay financial attainment; and be it 5 further 6 7 RESOLVED, That our AMA support equal pay transparency measures, in which physicians 8 (regardless of race) have appropriate means to access knowledge of a range of pay 9 comparable to their white professional counterparts. 10 11 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for policy that mandates equal pay for physicians 12 adjustment for hours worked, years of practice, practice ownership status, board certification 13 status, IMG status, type of degree, demographics of practice, and proportion of Medicare and 14 Medicaid patient 15 Fiscal Note: Significant, 10 Date Received: 04/21/2019 References: 1.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Gender Disparitie s in Physician Income and Advancement D-200.981 1. Our AMA encourages medical associations and other relevant organizations to study gender differences in income and advancement trends, by specialty, experience, work hours and other practice characteristi cs, and develop programs to address disparities where they exist; 2. Our AMA supports physicians in making informed decisions on work -life balance issues through the continued development of informational resources on issues such as part-time work options, job sharing, flexible scheduling, reentry, and contract negotiations; 3. Our AMA urges medical schools, hospitals, group practices and other physician employers to institute and monitor transparency in pay levels in order to identify and eliminate gender bias and promote gender equity throughout the profession; Resolution 42 (A-19) Page 3 of 4 4. Our AMA will collect and publicize information on best practices in academic medicine and non academic medicine that foster gender parity in the profession; and 5. Our AMA will provide training on leadership development, contract and salary negotiations and career advancement strategies, to combat gender disparities as a member benefit. Increase the Representation of Minority and Economically Disadvantaged Populations in the Medical Profession H-350.979 1. Our AMA supports increasing the representation of minorities in the physician population by: (1) Supporting efforts to increase the applicant pool of qualified minority students by: (a) Encouraging state and local governments to make quality elementary and secondary education opportunities available to all; (b) Urging medical schools to strengthen or initiate programs that offer special premedical and precollegiate experiences to underrepresented minority students; (c) urging medical schools and other health training institutions to develop new and innovative measures to recruit underrepresented minority students, and (d) Supporting legislation that provides targeted financial aid to financially disadvantaged students at both the collegiate and medical school levels. (2). Encouraging all medical schools to reaffirm the goal of increasing representation of underrepresented minorities in their student bodies and faculties. (3) Urging medical school admission committees to consider minority represen tation as one factor in reaching their decisions. (4) Increasing the supply of minority health professionals. (5) Continuing its efforts to increase the proportion of minorities in medical schools and medical school faculty. (6) Facilitating communication between medical school admission committees and premedical counselors concerning the relative importance of requirements, including grade point average and Medical College Aptitude Test scores. (7) Continuing to urge for state legislation that will provide funds for medical education both directly to medical schools and indirectly through financial support to students. (8) Continuing to provide strong support for federal legislation that provides financial assistance for able students whose financial need is such that otherwise they would be unable to attend medical school. Revisions to AMA Policy on the Physician Workforce H-200.955 It is AMA policy that: (1) any workforce planning efforts, done by the AMA or others, should utilize data on all aspects of the health care system, including projected demographics of both providers and patients, the number and roles of other health professionals in providing care, and practice environment changes. Planning should have as a goal appropriate physician numbers, specialty mix, and geographic distribution. (2) Our AMA encourages and collaborates in the collection of the data needed for workforce planning and in the conduct of national and regional research on physician supply and distribution. The AMA will independe ntly and in collaboration with state and specialty societies, national medical organizations, and other public and private sector groups, compile and disseminate the results of the research. (3) The medical profession must be integrally involved in any workforce planning efforts sponsored by federal or state governments, or by the private sector. Resolution 42 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 (4) In order to enhance access to care, our AMA collaborates with the public and private sectors to ensure an adequate supply of physicians in all specialties and to develop strategies to mitigate the current geographic maldistribution of physicians. (5) There is a need to enhance underrepresented minority representation in medical schools and in the physician workforce, as a means to ultimately improve access to care for minority and underserved groups. (6) There should be no decrease in the number of funded graduate medical education (GME) positions. Any increase in the number of funded GME positions, overall or in a given specialty, and in the number of US medical students should be based on a demonstrated regional or national need. (7) Our AMA will collect and disseminate information on market demands and workforce needs, so as to assist medical students and resident physicians in selecting a specialty and choosing a career. (8) Our AMA will encourage the Health Resources & Service Administration to collaborate with specialty societies to determine specific changes that would improve the agency's physician workforce projections proce ss, to potentially include more detailed projection inputs, with the goal of producing more accurate and detailed projections including specialty and subspecialty workforces. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 43 (A-19) Introduced by: Sophia Spadafore, University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson; Adam Panzer, University of Colorado School of Medicine; Omar Salman, Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine; Ellena Popova, University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine; Sam uel Dubin, New York University School of Medicine Subject: Removing Sex Designation from the Public Portion of the Birth Certificate Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez, Chair) Whereas, Our AMA believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' gender 1 identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care (H -160.991) and opposes any 2 efforts to deny an individual's right to determine their stated sex marker or gender identity (H - 3 65.962); a nd 4 5 Whereas, The legal sex designated on the public \"upper portion\" of a birth certificate by a 6 physician is typically based solely on an external evaluation and if sex cannot be determined it 7 is left blank with no entry; sex is also not recorded on the private \"lower portion\" of the birth 8 certificate where vital medical data is recorded and reported to public health officials1-3; and 9 10 Whereas, The certificate of live birth draws on the information contained in the medical record 11 but is solely a legal document and is not used for patient care3,4; and 12 13 Whereas, Analysis of data from 1955 -2000 found that up to 1.7% of births in countries including 14 the US, Europe, and to a lesser extent Asia and Africa, deviate in some way from bina ry sex 15 designation, and therefore are categorized incorrectly as male or female on their birth 16 certificate5; and 17 18 Whereas, Only 9% of transgender people who want to change the sex designation on their birth 19 certificate actually do so , and 32% of transgender people with an ID who wanted to change the 20 sex did not do so due to co st6-8; and 21 22 Whereas, The National Transgender Discrimination Survey found only 24% of transgender 23 people were able to correct the gender marker on their birth ce rtificates, 18% were denied the 24 correction, and 53% had not attempted correctio n8; and 25 26 Whereas, A national survey of t ransgender individuals showed 32 % of transgender people were 27 harassed , asked to leave an establishment, or assaulted due to pre senting i dentification that did 28 not m atch their gender presentation , and 13% were denied coverage for medical services 29 considered to be gender -specific, including routine sexual or reproductive health screenings 30 such as Pap smears, prostate exams, and mammograms7,8; and 31 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 43 (A-19) Page 2 of 4 32 Whereas, The process of changing the sex designation on a birth certificate is complex and 33 typically requires legal counsel , adding additional cost and a necessary education level that 34 further disenfranchises the most vulnerable of transgender and intersex people8; and 35 36 Whereas, \" Sexual and gender identity are characterized by fluidity and change,\" and indi viduals 37 can and do identify a s genders other than male, female, or other, and would not be aided by 38 adding a third catch -all gender or sex category to the birth certificate9; and 39 40 Whereas, The German Constitutional Court recently ruled gender markers may be omitted from 41 birth certificates in children who cannot be assigned to a binary male/female sex, and similar 42 legislation is being considered in Malta and California10; therefore be it 43 44 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocate for the removal of \"sex\" as a legal designation on the 45 public portion of the birth certificate. 46 Fiscal Note: Significant, 10 Date Received: 04/21/2019 References: 1.

Medical Spectrum of Gender D -295.312 Given the medical spectrum of gender identity and sex, Our AMA: (1) Will work with appropriate medical organizations and community based organizations to inform and educate the medical community and the public on the medical spectrum of gender identity; (2) Encourages members to educate state and federal policymakers and legislators on and advocate for policies addressing the medical spectrum of gender identity to ensure access to quality health care; (3) Affirms t hat an individual's genotypic sex, phenotypic sex, sexual orientation, gender and gender identity are not always aligned or indicative of the other, and that gender for many individuals may differ from the sex assigned at birth. Conforming Birth Certific ate Policies to Current Medical Standards for Transgender Patients H -65.967 1. Our AMA supports policies that allow for a change of sex designation on birth certificates for transgender individuals based upon verification by a physician (MD or DO) that the individual has undergone gender transition according to applicable medical standards of care. 2. Our AMA: (a) supports elimination of any requirement that individuals undergo gender affirmation surgery in order to change their sex designation on birth cer tificates and supports modernizing state vital statistics statutes to ensure accurate gender markers on birth certificates; and (b) supports that any change of sex designation on an individual's birth certificate not hinder access to medically appropriate preventive care. Accuracy, Importance, and Application of Data from the US Vital Statistics System H - 85.961 Our AMA encourages physicians to provide complete and accurate information on prenatal care and hospital patient records of the mother and infant, as this information is the basis for the health and medical information on birth certificates. Reducing Suicide Risk Among Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Questioning Youth Through Collaboration with Allied Organizations H -60.927 Our AMA will p artner with public and private organizations dedicated to public health and public policy to reduce lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) youth suicide and improve health among LGBTQ youth. Health Care Needs of Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender Populations H -160.991 1. Our AMA: (a) believes that the physician's nonjudgmental recognition of patients' sexual orientations, sexual behaviors, and gender identities enhances the ability to render optimal patient care in health as well a s in illness. In the case of lesbian gay bisexual and transgender (LGBT) patients, this recognition is especially important to address the specific health care needs of people who are or may be LGBT; (b) is committed to taking a leadership role in: (i) educating physicians on the current state of research in and knowledge of LGBT Health and the need to elicit relevant gender and sexuality information from our patients; these efforts should start in medical school, but must also be a part of continuing medic al education; (ii) educating physicians to recognize the physical and psychological needs of LGBT patients; (iii) encouraging the development of educational programs in LGBT Health; (iv) encouraging physicians to seek out local or national experts in the h ealth care needs of LGBT people so that all physicians will achieve a better understanding of the medical needs of these populations; and (v) working with LGBT communities to offer physicians the opportunity to better understand Resolution 43 (A-19) Page 4 of 4 the medical needs of LGBT p atients; and (c) opposes, the use of \"reparative\" or \"conversion\" therapy for sexual orientation or gender identity. 2. Our AMA will collaborate with our partner organizations to educate physicians regarding: (i) the need for women who have sex with women to undergo regular cancer and sexually transmitted infection screenings due to their comparable or elevated risk for these conditions; and (ii) the need for comprehensive screening for sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men; and (iii) a ppropriate safe sex techniques to avoid the risk for sexually transmitted diseases. 3. Our AMA will continue to work alongside our partner organizations, including GLMA, to increase physician competency on LGBT health issues. 4. Our AMA will continue to ex plore opportunities to collaborate with other organizations, focusing on issues of mutual concern in order to provide the most comprehensive and up -to- date education and information to enable the provision of high quality and culturally competent care to L GBT people. Support of Human Rights and Freedom H -65.965 Our AMA: (1) continues to support the dignity of the individual, human rights and the sanctity of human life, (2) reaffirms its long -standing policy that there is no basis for the denial to any human being of equal rights, privileges, and responsibilities commensurate with his or her individual capabilities and ethical character because of an individual's sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or transgender status, race, religion, disabi lity, ethnic origin, national origin, or age; (3) opposes any discrimination based on an individual's sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, race, religion, disability, ethnic origin, national origin or age and any other such reprehensible policies; (4) recognizes that hate crimes pose a significant threat to the public health and social welfare of the citizens of the United States, urges expedient passage of appropriate hate crimes prevention legislation in accordance with our AMA's policy through letters to members of Congress; and registers support for hate crimes prevention legislation, via letter, to the President of the United States. Access to Basic Human Services for Transgender Individuals H -65.964 Our AMA: (1) opposes policies preventing trans gender individuals from accessing basic human services and public facilities in line with one's gender identity, including, but not limited to, the use of restrooms; and (2) will advocate for the creation of policies that promote social equality and safe a ccess to basic human services and public facilities for transgender individuals according to one's gender identity. Appropriate Placement of Transgender Prisoners H -430.982 1. Our AMA supports the ability of transgender prisoners to be placed in faciliti es, if they so choose, that are reflective of their affirmed gender status, regardless of the prisoner's genitalia, chromosomal make -up, hormonal treatment, or non -, pre-, or post -operative status. 2. Our AMA supports that the facilities housing transgende r prisoners shall not be a form of administrative segregation or solitary confinement. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 44 (A-19) Introduced by: Region 4 Subject: Promote ultrasound as a cost effective measure in diagnostic imaging. Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , Ultrasound is an inexpensive diagnostic tool that can be used immediately upon 1 patient arrival to allow for faster diagnosis and treatment as well as, in appropriate situations, to 2 prevent further, more -costly testing from being needed1 ; and 3 4 Whereas, In situations where ultrasound allows for the confirmed diagnosis of some diseases, 5 such as in certain cases of appendicitis, then a subsequent CT and the accompanying radiation 6 exposure as well as increased cost of that CT can be avoided2; and 7 8 Whereas, Ultrasound paired with cystoscopy was found to be the most cost -effective protocol 9 for diagnosis of certain cancers and other diseases, such as whe n it was found to be near as 10 effective at cancer detection as CT alone, cystoscopy alone, and CT and cystoscopy together in 11 a workup of a symptomatic microscopic hematuri a3; and 12 13 Wher eas, Ultrasound was found to be more than six times less expensive than CT, with 14 ultrasound costing an average of $88 and CT costing an average of $547 in the case of 15 appendicitis2; and 16 17 Whereas, As opposed to CT, ultrasound use does not result in radiatio n exposure, which is 18 likely to decrease cancer deaths by 180 out of 262,000 people and save $339.5 million in terms 19 of years of life lost2; and 20 21 Whereas, Ultrasound was determined to be the most cost -effective and recommended method 22 of imaging for certain musculoskeletal diseases, such as rotator cuff disease4; and 23 24 Whereas, As evidenced by increasing rates of MRI in cases where ultrasound is recommended, 25 policies are needed to guide appropriate choice of imaging, including promoting increased use 26 of ultra sound in place of more expensive and less cost -effective diagnostic tools4; and 27 28 Whereas, Current AMA policy supports the use of ultrasound, stating that is effective and safe 29 when used appropriately (H-480.950 ); therefore be it 30 31 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -480.950 by addition as follows . 32 33 Diagnostic Ultrasound Utilization and Education , H-480.950 34 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 44 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 Our AMA affirms that ultrasound imaging is a safe, effective, and efficient tool when 1 utilized by, or under the directi on of, appropriately trained physicians and supports the 2 educational efforts and widespread integration of ultrasound throughout the continuum of 3 medical education.

Equal Fees for Osteopathic and Allopathic Medical Students H -295.876 Our AMA, in collaboration with the American Osteopathic Association, discourages discrimination against medical students by insti tutions and programs based on osteopathic or allopathic training. 2. Our AMA encourages equitable fees for allopathic and osteopathic medical students in access to clinical electives, while respecting the rights of individual allopathic and osteopathic med ical schools to set their own policies related to visiting students. Expanding the Visiting Students Application Service for Visiting Student Electives in the Fourth Year H -295.867 1. Our American Medical Association strongly encourages the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) to expand eligibility for the Visiting Students Application Service (VSAS) to medical students from Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) -accredited medical schools. 2. Our AMA supports and encourages the AAMC in its efforts to increase the number of members and non -member programs in the VSAS, such as medical schools accredited by COCA and teaching institutions not affiliated with a medical school. 3. Our AMA encourages the AAMC to ensure that member insti tutions that previously accepted both allopathic and osteopathic applications for fourth year clerkships prior to VSAS implementation continue to have a mechanism for accepting such applications of osteopathic medical students. ACGME Residency Program Ent ry Requirements H -310.909 Our AMA supports entry into Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) Resolution 45 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 accredited residency and fellowship programs from either ACGME -accredited programs or American Osteopathic Association -accredited programs. Equality for COMLEX and USMLE Our AMA promote equal acceptance of the USMLE and COMLEX at all United States residency programs; Our AMA work with appropriate stakeholders including but not limited to the National Board of Medical Examiners, Association of American Medical Colleges, National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners, Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and American Osteopathic Association to educate Residency Program Directors on how to interpret and use COMLEX scores; and that the AMA work with Residency Program Directors to promote higher COMLEX utilization with residency program matches in light of the new single accreditation system. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 46 (A-19) Introduced by: Pinilla Victoria, University of Miam i Miller School of Medicine Subject: Laying the first steps towards a t ransition to a Financial and Citizenship Need Blind Model for Organ Procurement and Transplantation Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , as of April 21, 2019 - there are 113,717 people in the U.S. waiting to receive a 1 transplant1; and 2 3 Whereas, National Organ Transplant Act was passed by congress in 1984 to address concerns 4 that unfair organ allocation based on financial status and not medical need, would discourage 5 organ donation in the United States (U.S.)2; and 6 7 Whereas, inequity in access to transplant services between organ donors and recipients in the 8 U.S. exists even after the passing of the 1984 National Organ Transplant Act2,3; and 9 10 Whereas, for instance - if a person that is an undocumented immigrant were to expire but were 11 registered as an organ donor - the person's organs would most likely be transplanted to an 12 insured and/or patient that is able to pay for the transplant and anti -rejection medications based 13 on current policy2,4; and 14 15 Whereas, i f the undocumented organ dono r were to be the patient themselves, they do not have 16 access to be placed on the transplant list due to their undocumented and/or financial status in 17 the U.S.5; and 18 19 Whereas, increase organ donation in California is attributed to undocumented immigrants 20 registering to be organ donors making them part of a community of organ donors that give in to 21 the system but are not considered when allocating organs6; and 22 23 Whereas, 6,500 undocumented immigrants with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) don't have 24 access to organ transplants creating an inequitable gap in needs versus allocation of resources 25 within our current system3; and 26 27 Whereas, 35 years have passed between the last U.S. task force created by congress on organ 28 transplantation where the demographics of the U.S. have changed substantially2,5,7; and 29 30 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 46 (A-19) Page 2 of 5 Whereas, there are 200+ transplant boards that i n practice have used their discretion to 1 routinely deny placing patients in transplant lists due to their financial and/or undocumented 2 status in the U.S. with onl y a few covering the transplant costs of uninsured undocumented 3 patients5,7; and 4 5 Whereas, transplant center boards state they look at financial and/or undocumented status in 6 the U.S. because providing transplants to these patients can place these centers in a financial 7 hardship on hospitals when they don't get a reimbursement for the transplant services, they 8 perform5 9 10 Whereas, if we want a transparent equitable organ donation and transplantation of our nation's 11 scarce and lifesaving resources, we must ethically have legal status and need blind 12 Procurement of Organ Transplantation model ; therefore be it 13 14 RESOLVED, That our AMA support and advocate for federal laws that remove financial barriers 15 to transplant recipients such as provisions for expenses involved in the transplantation of organs 16 incurred by the uninsured regardless of a legally defined United States Citiz enship and 17 Immigration Service (USCIS) status in the country as long as the person can show physical 18 presence in the U.S. prior to needing the organ; and 19 20 RESOLVED, That our AMA promote and advocate for a 2020 national taskforce for organ 21 procurement and tr ansplant. Task force to be renewed every 20 years to access the needs of 22 the generation and account for change in demographics and technology; and 23 24 RESOLVED, That our AMA research a fiscal federal strategy to cover annual transplant costs in 25 the U.S. for pa tients without insurance distributed among the over 200 transplant centers in the 26 U.S.; and 27 28 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend 6.2.1 in the Code of Ethics explicitly state that organs should 29 be allocated to recipients on the basis of ethically sound criteria wit hout regard to a legally 30 defined United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) status as long as the 31 recipient can show physical presence in the U.S. prior to needing the organ, thereby keeping 32 the overall equitability of the system for donatin g and receiving parties intact. 33 34 Guidelines for Organ Transplantation from Deceased Donors, 6.2.1 AMA code of 35 Medical Ethics, .2.1 AMA code of Medical Ethics 36 37 6.2.1 in the Code of Ethics states \"Physicians who par ticipate in transplantation of 38 organs from deceased donors should: ...

(a) These criteria include likelihood of benefit, urgency of need, change in quality of life, duration of benefit, and, in some cases, the amount of resources required for successful treatment. In general, only very subst antial differences among patients are ethically relevant; the greater the disparities, the more justified the use of these criteria becomes. In making quality of life judgments, patients should first be prioritized so that death or extremely poor outcomes are avoided; then, patients should be prioritized according to change in quality of life, but only when there are very substantial differences among patients. (b) Research should be pursued to increase knowledge of outcomes and thereby improve the accuracy of these criteria. (c) Non -medical criteria, such as ability to pay, social worth, perceived obstacles to treatment, patient contribution to illness, or past use of resources should not be considered.\" Directed Donation of Organs for Transplantation 6.2.2 Code of Medical Ethics 1. \"Although public solicitations for directed donation \u2014that is, for donation to a specific patient \u2014may benefit individual patients, such solicitations have the potential to adversely affect the equitable distribution of organs among patients in need, the efficacy of the transplant system, and trust in the overal l system\" Transplantable Organs as a National Resource H-370.990 1. \"Our AMA: (1) supports the United Network of Organ Sharing (UNOS) po licy calling for regional allocation of livers to status 1 (most urgent medical need) patients as an effort to more equitably distribute a scarce resource\" Removing Financial Barrier to Living Organ Donation H-370.965 1. Our AMA supports federal and state laws that remove financial barriers to living organ donation, such as: (a) provisions for expenses involved in the donation incurred by the organ donor; (b) providing access to health care coverage of any medical expense related to the donation; (c) provisions for expenses incurred after the donation as a consequence of donation; (d) prohibiting employment discrimination on the basis of living donor status; (e) prohibiting the use of living donor status as the sole basis for denying or limiting health, life, and disability and long -term care ins urance coverage; and (f) provisions to encourage paid leave for organ donation. Methods to Increase the US Organ Donation Pool H-370.959 1. In order to encourage increased levels of organ donation in the United States, our American Medical Association: (1) supports studies that evaluate the effectiveness of mandated choice and presumed consent models for increasing organ donation; (2) urges development of effective methods for meaningful exchange of information to educate the public and support well -informed consent about donating organs, including educational programs that address identified factors influencing attitud es toward organ donation and targeted to populations with historically Resolution 46 (A-19) Page 5 of 5 low organ donation rates; and (3) encourages continued study of ways to enhance the allocation of donated organs and tissues. Organ Donor Recruitment H-370.996 1. Our AMA (1) continues to urge Americans to sign donor cards; (2) supports continued effor ts to teach physicians through continuing medical education courses, and the lay public through health education programs, about transplantation issues in general and the importance of organ donation in particular;(3) encourages state governments to attemp t pilot studies on promotional efforts that stimulate each adult to respond \"yes\" or \"no\" to the option of signing a donor card.; and(4) in collaboration with all other interested parties, support the exploration of methods to greatly increase organ donati on, such as the \"presumed consent\" modality of organ donation. Organ Donor Recruitment H-370.995 1. Our AMA supports development of \"stat e of the art\" educational materials for the medical community and the public at large, demonstrating at least the following: (1) the need for organ donors; (2) the success rate for organ transplantation; (3) the medico -legal aspects of organ transplantat ion; (4) the integration of organ recruitment, preservation and transplantation; (5) cost/reimbursement mechanisms for organ transplantation; and (6) the ethical considerations of organ donor recruitment. The Physician's Role in Organ Donation H-370.997 1. Our AMA will continue to promote organ donation awareness. Equal Access to Organ Transplantation for Medicaid Beneficiaries H-370.962 1.

It is AMA policy that all persons, regardless of economic and insurance status, receive all Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) -recommended vaccines as soon as possible following publication of these recommendations in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). 2. Our AMA will continue to work with the federal government, Congress, and other stakeholders to improve liability protection for vaccine manufacturers and health care Resolution 48 (A-19) Page 4 of 6 professionals who provide immunization services and to examine and improve compensation mechan isms for patients who were legitimately injured by a vaccine. 3. Our AMA will continue to work with the federal government, Congress, and other appropriate stakeholders to enhance public opinion of vaccines and to monitor and ensure the continued safety of existing and newly approved vaccines (including providing adequate resources for post-approval surveillance) so as to maintain and improve public confidence in the safety of vaccines. 4. Our AMA will work with appropriate stakeholders, including vacci ne manufacturers, vaccine distributors, the federal government, medical specialty societies, and third party payers, to guarantee a robust vaccine delivery infrastructure (including but not limited to, the research and development of new vaccines, the abil ity to track the real -time supply status of ACIP - recommended vaccines, and the timely distribution of ACIP -recommended vaccines to providers). 5. Our AMA will work with appropriate federal and state agencies and private sector entities to ensure that sta te Medicaid agencies and private insurance plans pay health care professionals at least the approved Relative Value Unit (RVU) administration Medicare rates for payment when they administer ACIP -recommended vaccines. 6. Our AMA will work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to address barriers associated with Medicare recipients receiving live zoster vaccine and the routine boosters Td and Tdap in physicians' offices. 7. Our AMA will work through appropriate state entities to ensure all health insurance plans rapidly include newly ACIP -recommended vaccines in their list of covered benefits, and to pay health care professionals fairly for the purchase and administration of ACIP -recommended vaccines. 8. Our AMA will urge Medicare to include Tdap (Tetanus, Diphtheria, Acellular Pertussis) under Medicare Part B as a national public health measure to help prevent the spread of Pertussis. 9. Until compliance of AMA Policy H -440.875(6) is actualized to the AMA's satisfaction regarding th e tetanus vaccine, our AMA will aggressively petition CMS to include tetanus and Tdap at both the \"Welcome to Medicare\" and Annual Medicare Wellness visits, and other clinically appropriate encounters, as additional \"triggering event codes\" (using the AT o r another modifier) that allow for coverage and payment of vaccines to Medicare recipients. 10. Our AMA will aggressively petition CMS to include coverage and payment for any vaccinations administered to Medicare patients that are recommended by the ACIP , the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), or based on prevailing preventive clinical health guidelines. Childhood Immunizations H -60.969 Resolution 48 (A-19) Page 5 of 6 1. Our AMA will lobby Congress to provide both the resources and the programs necessary, using the recommenda tions of the National Vaccine Advisory Committee and in accordance with the provision set forth in the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Act, to ensure that children nationwide are immunized on schedule, thus representing progress in preventive medicine . 2. Our AMA endorses the recommendations on adolescent immunizations developed by the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices and approved by both the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics. 3. Our AMA will develop model state legislation to require that students entering middle or junior high school be adequately immunized according to current national standards. 4. Our AMA encourages state medical societies to advocate legislation or regulations in their state that are consistent with the AMA model state legislation. 5. Our AMA will continue to work with managed care groups and state and specialty medical societies to support a dedicated preventive health care visit at 11 -12 years of age. 6. Our AMA wil l work with the American Academy of Family Physicians and the American Academy of Pediatrics to strongly encourage the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to deactivate coding edits that cause a decrease in immunization rates for children, and to make these edit deactivations retroactive to January 1, 2013. Education and Public Awareness on Vaccine Safety and Efficacy H -440.830 1. Our AMA (a) encourages the development and dissemination of evidence -based public awareness campaigns aimed at increasing vaccination rates; (b) encourages the development of educational materials that can be distributed to patients and their families clearly articulating the benefits of immunizations and highlighting the exemplary safety record of vaccines; (c) supports the development and evaluation, in collaboration with health care providers, of evidence -based educational resources to assist parents in educating and encouraging other parents who may be reluctant to vaccinate their children; (d) encourages physicians and s tate and local medical associations to work with public health officials to inform those who object to immunizations about the benefits of vaccinations and the risks to their own health and that of the general public if they refuse to accept them; (e) will promote the safety and efficacy of vaccines while rejecting claims that have no foundation in science; and (f) will continue its ongoing efforts with other immunization advocacy organizations to assist physicians and other health care professionals in eff ectively communicating to patients, parents, policy makers, and the media that vaccines do not cause autism and that decreasing immunization rates have resulted in a resurgence of vaccine -preventable diseases and deaths. 2. Our AMA: (a) supports the rigoro us scientific process of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as well as its development of recommended immunization schedules for the nation; Resolution 48 (A-19) Page 6 of 6 (b) recognizes the substantial body of scientific evidence that has disproven a link between vaccines and autism; and (c) opposes the creation of a new federal commission on vaccine safety whose task is to study an association between autism and vaccines. Nonmedical Exemptions from Immunizations H -440.970 Our American Medical Association believes that n onmedical (religious, philosophic, or personal belief) exemptions from immunizations endanger the health of the unvaccinated individual and the health of those in his or her group and the community at large. Therefore, our AMA (1) supports the immunizatio n recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) for all individuals without medical contraindications; (2) supports legislation eliminating nonmedical exemptions from immunization; (3) encourages state medical associations to seek removal of nonmedical exemptions in statutes requiring mandatory immunizations, including for childcare and school attendance; (4) encourages physicians to grant vaccine exemption requests only when medical contraindications are present; (5) encourages state and local medical associations to work with public health officials to develop contingency plans for controlling outbreaks in medically -exempt populations and to intensify efforts to achieve high immunization rates in communities where non medical exemptions are common; and (6) recommends that states have in place: (a) an established mechanism, which includes the involvement of qualified public health physicians, of determining which vaccines will be mandatory for admission to school and o ther identified public venues (based upon the recommendations of the ACIP); and (b) policies that permit immunization exemptions for medical reasons only. AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 49 (A-19) Introduced by: Ryan Englander, Ian Whitall, Alexandra Clement, University of Connecticut School of Medicine Subject: Ensuring Fair Pricing of Drugs Developed with the United States Government Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , The United States spends almost twice as much on healthcare as other comparable 1 high income countries despite similar utilization rates, driven in part by higher spending on 2 prescription drugs than other comparable nations1,2,3,4,5,6,7 ; and 3 4 Whereas, The United States spends between 30% and 190% more on pharmaceutical drugs 5 per capita as compared to other comparable high income countries despite similar utilization 6 rates3,4,5,6; and 7 8 Whereas, Many drugs cost significantly more in the United States than in other comparable 9 industrialized countries, imposing an undue financial burden on American consumers of 10 pharmaceutical compounds, particularly the uninsured, Medicare beneficiaries, and those 11 whose insurance plans do not cover medicines they need3,4,5,6,7,8; and 12 13 Whereas, The United States government is the world's largest funder of the basic science 14 research that supports the development of new pharmaceutical compounds9,10,11; and 15 16 Whereas, The Uni ted States government licenses drugs discovered in its laboratories to for - 17 profit entities in order to facilitate commercialization12,13,14; and 18 19 Whereas, Numerous examples exist of drugs funded in whole or in part by the US government 20 being sold in the Un ited States for higher prices than in other comparable industrialized 21 countries3,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23; and 22 23 Whereas, In 2004, Xalatan (latanoprost), a drug developed by the NIH that was licensed to 24 Pfizer, was sold by Pfizer in the US at 2 -5x the pri ce as in Canada and Europe, leading to a 25 petition to the NIH to take steps to lower Xalatan's price15; and 26 27 Whereas, In 2016, Xtandi (enzalutamide), developed at the University of California -Los Angeles 28 with NIH -funded research grants and marketed by Japan ese firm Astellas, was being sold 29 wholesale at $129,000 in the US, $39,000 in Japan and Sweden, and $30,000 in Canada, 30 prompting a group of US Congressmen to petition the NIH to hold hearings regarding taking 31 steps to lower Xtandi's price15,16; and 32 33 Wherea s, In 2015, a US Senate Finance Committee investigation found that Gilead Sciences, 34 Inc. had set the price of its Hepatitis C drug Sovaldi at $85,000 with the sole goal of maximizing 35 Next Table of Contents PreviousResolution 49 (A-19) Page 2 of 10 revenue, while the same drug was sold in the UK and Germany for $55,000 a nd $67,000 1 respectively17,18; and 2 3 Whereas, In 2016, the US Department of Defense developed an experimental Zika vaccine and 4 announced intent to grant an exclusive license to manufacture that vaccine to Sanofi Pasteur, 5 Inc.18,19, who subsequently refused r equests from the Department of Defense to agree to charge 6 US patients no more than patients in other countries20,21; and 7 8 Whereas, In 2017, an investigation by the advocacy group Knowledge Ecology International 9 demonstrated that Sanofi Pasteur, Inc. was ch arging US patients 4.38 -8.38x more for its 10 multiple sclerosis drug Aubagio (teriflunomide) than in other developed countries, including 11 Australia, France, Ireland, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom22; and 12 13 Whereas, In 2004, Abbott Laboratories increased the price of its protease inhibitor Norvir 14 (ritonavir) by 4x only in the United States, prompting calls from advocacy groups for the NIH to 15 intervene to lower its price23; and 16 17 Whereas, In 2010, an investigation by Knowledge Ecology International demonstrated that 18 prices for Norvir as a standalone product remained between 4.09 -10.29x higher in the United 19 States as compared to other wealthy developed nations, including Australia, Austria, Canada, 20 Denmark, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden24; and 21 22 Whereas, Pharmaceutical companies and industry advocacy groups excuse high prices by 23 explaining they are necessary for research and development of new drugs25,26,27; and 24 25 Whereas, A report by the US Government Accountability Office found that pharmaceutical sales 26 increased by 45% globally over the period from 2006 to 2015 and two thirds of pharmaceutical 27 companies saw their profit margins increase over that time period, whi le annual research and 28 development investment in the United States increased by only 8% over the period from 2008 to 29 201428; and 30 31 Whereas, Pharmaceutical companies have a higher average profit margin than all comparable 32 industries, including software devel opment which is often cited as a similar industry with high 33 upfront R&D costs and low relative distribution costs28,29; and 34 35 Whereas, The United States pays an estimated 70% of all pharmaceutical profits obtained from 36 OECD nations despite only accounting f or 34% of the OECD's GDP30; and 37 38 Whereas, While the 1980 Bayh -Dole Act grants US government agencies the authority to 39 unilaterally revoke licenses to companies or order that additional licenses be granted in order to 40 ensure access (so -called \"march in righ ts\"), this extraordinary power has never been used to 41 ensure fair pricing31,32,33; and 42 43 Whereas, The NIH has repeatedly decided that it does not have the statutory authority to use its 44 march -in rights to force licensees to set fair prices for American cons umers as this is under the 45 purview of Congress34,35,36; and 46 47 Whereas, 29 European countries currently use a model called international reference pricing 48 (IRP) to set drug prices whereby insurers and/or socialized healthcare programs agree to pay a 49 maximum price for drugs set to an index of prices paid by comparable nations or use such an 50 index as a benchmark for negotiations to set prices37,38; and 51 Resolution 49 (A-19) Page 3 of 10 1 Whereas, Studies of the effectiveness of IRP have found that it lowers prices, increases 2 utilization of drug classes to which the model is applied, and reduces expenditures with no 3 negative effects on health outcomes39,40,41,42,43; and 4 5 Whereas, One of the most common concerns regarding IRP is that it may incentivize 6 pharmaceutical companies to delay or eliminate product launches in countries with a lower 7 willingness to pay44,45,46,47; and 8 9 Whereas, Analyses of IRP's effects on pharmaceutical product launch delay have found the 10 effect is weak and is limited to countries with a lower willingness to pay48,49,50; and 11 12 Whereas, The United States is one of the nations with the highest willingness to pay in 13 aggregate, implying IRP's tendency to delay pharmaceutical product launch in lower -income 14 countries would likely not apply to the United States8,9,47,48; and 15 16 Whereas , The Institute for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation in the Department of Health and 17 Human Services (HHS) has proposed a new model for Medicare Part B reimbursement for 18 single -source pharmaceuticals and biologics to be phased into 50% of Medicare Part B pl ans 19 between 2020 to 2025 that shifts the reimbursement structure to an IRP model, using 126% of 20 the average price paid for a drug in 16 comparable OECD countries for which drug pricing 21 information is widely and publicly available as a benchmark2,49,50,51; and 22 23 Whereas, Over the five years of its implementation, the proposed model is expected to save 24 $17.2 billion overall including $3.4 billion in direct out -of-pocket savings without changing 25 Medicare Part B's benefit structure50,51; and 26 27 Whereas, The AMA has expressed concern that the involuntary nature of the trial program may 28 pose risks to patient access to necessary medications should third party vendors be unable to 29 negotiate prices for drugs that fall at or under Medicare's target price for reimbursem ent52; and 30 31 Whereas, Existing AMA Policy (H -110.997, H -110.988, H -110.987, D -110.993, H -110.991, D 32 110.988, H -110.998, D -330.954) highlights the AMA's continuing commitment to lowering 33 prescription drug costs, so long as physician freedom of choice is pr eserved and appropriate 34 incentives for pharmaceutical research and development are maintained ; therefore be it 35 36 RESOLVED, That our AMA advocates for the Administration's proposed Medicare Part B rule 37 change wherein Medicare Part B's target price for reim bursement of single source drugs is set 38 at 126% of their average prices in sixteen countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, 39 Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Slovakia, Spain, and the 40 United Kingdom) included in the Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary for Planning 41 and Evaluation's analysis of drug price differences between those countries and Medicare Part 42 B, provided that the rule change be updated to allow voluntary opting -out by physicians and/or 43 vend ors should either party determine the testing program is adversely affecting patient access, 44 healthcare utilization, drug prices, or health outcomes; and be it further 45 46 RESOLVED, That our AMA study: a) the consequences of Medicare Part B's new IRP -based 47 reimbursement model with an emphasis on determining its effects on access to included 48 pharmaceuticals, the cost of said pharmaceuticals, and overall health outcomes, b) the potential 49 Resolution 49 (A-19) Page 4 of 10 impacts on access to pharmaceuticals, their costs, and overall health ou tcomes were the 1 current proposed policy expanded to multiple source drugs, and c) alternative IRP -based 2 models that Medicare Part B could employ, including using a target price identified by IRP as a 3 set point for negotiations between pharmaceutical compan ies and the government. 4 5 Fiscal Note: Significant, 12 Date Woskie LR, Jha AK.

Our AMA encou rages Federal Trade Commission (FTC) actions to limit anticompetitive behavior by pharmaceutical companies attempting to reduce competition from generic manufacturers through manipulation of patent protections and abuse of regulatory exclusivity incentives . 2. Our AMA encourages Congress, the FTC and the Department of Health and Human Services to monitor and evaluate the utilization and impact of controlled distribution channels for prescription pharmaceuticals on patient access and market competition. 3. Our AMA will monitor the impact of mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical industry. 4. Our AMA will continue to monitor and support an appropriate balance between incentives based on appropriate safeguards for innovation on the one hand and efforts to reduce regulatory and statutory barriers to competition as part of the patent system. Resolution 49 (A-19) Page 9 of 10 5. Our AMA encourages prescription drug price and cost transparency among pharmaceutical companies, pharmacy benefit managers and health insurance companies. 6. Our AM A supports legislation to require generic drug manufacturers to pay an additional rebate to state Medicaid programs if the price of a generic drug rises faster than inflation. 7. Our AMA supports legislation to shorten the exclusivity period for biologics. 8. Our AMA will convene a task force of appropriate AMA Councils, state medical societies and national medical specialty societies to develop principles to guide advocacy and grassroots efforts aimed at addressing pharmaceutical costs and improving patien t access and adherence to medically necessary prescription drug regimens. 9. Our AMA will generate an advocacy campaign to engage physicians and patients in local and national advocacy initiatives that bring attention to the rising price of prescription dr ugs and help to put forward solutions to make prescription drugs more affordable for all patients. 10. Our AMA supports: (a) drug price transparency legislation that requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to provide public notice before increasing the price of any drug (generic, brand, or specialty) by 10% or more each year or per course of treatment and provide justification for the price increase; (b) legislation that authorizes the Attorney General and/or the Federal Trade Commission to take legal action to address price gouging by pharmaceutical manufacturers and increase access to affordable drugs for patients; and (c) the expedited review of generic drug applications and prioritizing review of such applications when there is a drug shortage, no availabl e comparable generic drug, or a price increase of 10% or more each year or per course of treatment. 11. Our AMA advocates for policies that prohibit price gouging on prescription medications when there are no justifiable factors or data to support the pric e increase. 12.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Informing the Public & Physicians about Health Risks of Sedative Hypnotics, Especially Rohypnol H -515.968 The AMA re -emphasizes to physicians and public health officials the fact that Rohypnol (a benzodiazepine), other benzodiazepines, and other sedatives and hypnotics carry the risk of misuse, morbidity and mortality. The AMA supports public education and public health initiatives regarding the dangers of the use of sedatives and hypnotics in sexual abuse and rape, especially when mixed with ethanol ingestion. Resolution 50 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 Benzodiazepine Education H -100.976 Our AMA encourages physicians interested in the addictive nature of benzodiazepines and their rational use to seek information from appropriate sources. Inappropriate Use of CDC Guidelines for Prescribing Opioids D -120.932 1. Our AMA applauds the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for its efforts to prevent the incidence of new cases of opioid misuse, addiction, and overdose deaths. 2. Our AMA will actively continue to communicate and engage with the natio n's largest pharmacy chains, pharmacy benefit managers, National Association of Insurance Commissioners, Federation of State Medical Boards, and National Association of Boards of Pharmacy in opposition to communications being sent to physicians that includ e a blanket proscription against filing prescriptions for opioids that exceed numerical thresholds without taking into account the diagnosis and previous response to treatment for a patient and any clinical nuances that would support such prescribing as fa lling within standards of good quality patient care. A report is due back to the House of Delegates at the 2019 Annual Meeting. 3. Our AMA affirms that some patients with acute or chronic pain can benefit from taking opioid pain medications at doses greate r than generally recommended in the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain and that such care may be medically necessary and appropriate. 4. Our AMA will advocate against misapplication of the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids by pharma cists, health insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, legislatures, and governmental and private regulatory bodies in ways that prevent or limit patients' medical access to opioid analgesia. 5. Our AMA will advocate that no entity should use MME (morphine mil ligram equivalents) thresholds as anything more than guidance, and physicians should not be subject to professional discipline, loss of board certification, loss of clinical privileges, criminal prosecution, civil liability, or other penalties or practice limitations solely for prescribing opioids at a quantitative level above the MME thresholds found in the CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids. A More Uniform Approach to Assessing and Treating Patients for Controlled Substances for Pain Relief D -120.947 1. Our AMA will consult with relevant Federation partners and consider developing by consensus a set of best practices to help inform the appropriate clinical use of opioid analgesics, including risk assessment and monitoring for substance use disorders, i n the management of persistent pain. 2. Our AMA will urge the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to take the lead in promoting a standard approach to documenting and assessing unintentional poisonings and deaths involving prescription opioids, incl uding obtaining more complete information on other contributing factors in such individuals, in order to develop the most appropriate solutions to prevent these incidents. 3. Our AMA will work diligently with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other regulatory agencies to provide increased leeway in the interpretation of the new guidelines for appropriate prescription of opioid medications in long -term care facilities and in the care of patients with cancer and cancer -related pain, in much t he same way as is being done for hospice and palliative care.

AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION ASSEMBLY Resolution 52 (A-19) Introduced by: Rahul Ramaswamy, Pious Patel, Daniel Pereira, Thomas Sanjana Salwi , Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Subject: A RESOLUTION to Encourage Recovery Homes to Implement Evidence Based Policies Regarding Access to Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) for Opioid Use Disorder . Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) Whereas , the opioid epidemic is one of America's most debilitating crises, resulting in loss of 1 life, productivity, and increased healthcare expenditure ; and 2 3 Whereas, recovery homes have historically prohibited medications for opioid use disorder1; and 4 5 Whereas, in 2017 Tennessee suffered 1300 opioid overdose deaths and 8000 hospitalizations from opioid misuse,2 with a rate of 19.4 opioid deaths per 100,000 citizens compared to the 7 national average of 14.63; and 8 9 Whereas, Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) remains the medical gold standard of care to 10 reduce long -term opioid use and prevent relapse4; and 11 12 Whereas , MAT using buprenorphine/naloxone or methadone has been proven to significantly 13 reduce illicit drug use, increase productivity,5 and reduce healthcare costs in patients with 14 substance use disorders6; and 15 16 Whereas, only 20.9% of nationally -sampled addictio n recovery homes allow buprenorphine 17 maintenance therapy, only 7.8% allow methadone therapy, only 22.0% allow naltrexone 18 therapy, and less than half of eligible patients in all these categories successfully received their 19 medication7; and 20 21 Whereas, patient s without MAT are more than twice as likely to be readmitted within 30 days ,8 22 the average length of inpatient stay for opioid addiction treatment is 7 days,9 and the average 23 cost for each hospital inpatient day is $2424, making the average cost of each rea dmission 24 $16,96810; and 25 26 Whereas, national survey data show common barriers to MAT adoption include cultural 27 adherence toward 12 -step ideology, lack of access to prescribers, and lack of decisive clinical 28 guidance on policy11; and 29 30 Table of Contents PreviousResolution 52 (A-19) Page 2 of 3 Whereas, the AMA endorses the elimination of barriers to MAT and increasing awareness of 1 MAT as first line treatment for substance abuse disorder12,13, but does not explicitly endorse 2 policy change at post -discharge addiction recovery homes ; therefore be it 3 4 RESOLVED, That our AMA urges policy changes at recovery homes to allow patients to remain 5 on Medication Assisted Treatment as prescribed by a provider, including 6 buprenorphine/naloxone combinations, without restrictions or mandato ry tapering of doses. 7 8 Fiscal Note: Significant, 10 Date Received: 04/ 21/2019 References: 1.

RELEVANT AMA AND AMA -MSS POLICY Support the Elimination of Barriers to Medication -Assisted Treat ment for Substance Use Disorder D -95.968 Resolution 52 (A-19) Page 3 of 3 Our AMA will: (1) advocate for legislation that eliminates barriers to, increases funding for, and requires access to all appropriate FDA -approved medications or therapies used by licensed drug treatment clinics or facilities; and (2) develop a public awareness campaign to increase awareness that medical treatment of substance use disorder with medication - assisted treatment is a first -line treatment for this chronic medical disease. Opiate Replacement Th erapy Programs in Correctional Facilities H -430.987 1. Our AMA endorses: (a) the medical treatment model of employing opiate replacement therapy (ORT) as an effective therapy in treating opiate -addicted persons who are incarcerated; and (b) ORT for opiate -addicted persons who are incarcerated, in collaboration with the National Commission on Correctional Health Care and the American Society of Addiction Medicine. 2. Our AMA advocates for legislation, standards, policies and funding that encourage correctio nal facilities to increase access to evidence -based treatment of opioid use disorder, including initiation and continuation of opioid replacement therapy in conjunction with counseling, in correctional facilities within the United States and that this appl y to all incarcerated individuals including pregnant women. 3. Our AMA supports legislation, standards, policies, and funding that encourage correctional facilities within the United States to work in ongoing collaboration with addiction treatment physicia n-led teams, case managers, social workers, and pharmacies in the communities where patients, including pregnant women, are released to offer post - incarceration treatment plans for opioid use disorder, including education, medication for addiction treatme nt and counseling, and medication for preventing overdose deaths and help ensure post -incarceration medical coverage and accessibility to medication assisted therapy REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON ECONOMICS AND QUALITY IN MEDICINE MSS CEQM Report A A-19 Subject : Mobile Health Care and Community Paramedicine Presented by : MSS Committee on Economics and Quality in Medicine Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) ____________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 MSS Interim meeting, the AMA -MSS referred for study MSS Resolution 28 - 3 \"Supporting research into the use of Mobile Integrated Health Care and Community Paramedicine 4 in addressing the primary care shortage\" which states the following: 5 6 RESOLVED , That our AMA -MSS study mobile medical units as a means of 7 delivering healthcare to underserved communities. 8 9 The I -18 Reference Committee stated the following as its rationale for recommending MSS 10 Resolution 28 be adopted as amended: 11 12 Testimony was varied for this resolution. Concern was noted that the AMA should not 13 create extensive policy on paramedicine as our policy should focus on functioning of 14 physicians and not other medical professions. Amendments were made to address these 15 concerns. However, your Reference Committee found merit in the AMA -MSS further 16 studying this issue. 17 18 Staff experts expressed the following: 19 20 The fiscal note for Resolution 28 was Minimal with a score of 06. Please see fiscal note 21 rubric for further information. 22 23 The MSS Governing Council asked the 2019 Committee on Economics and Quality in Medicine 24 (CEQM) to review the evidence surrounding the use of community paramedicine in addressing 25 the primary care shortage, and to make a recommendation regardin g AMA -MSS policy towards 26 it. Accordingly, CEQM produced this report. 27 28 BACKGROUND 29 30 Community paramedicine is a model of healthcare in which paramedics embrace an expanded 31 scope of practice and function outside of their traditional emergency response and tr ansport roles, 32 Table of Contents Next to help fill gaps in the healthcare delivery system. Interest in community paramedicine stems from 1 the existence of health care service gaps in underserved communities and the desire to enhance 2 access to primary care for these populations. M obile integrated healthcare refers to the utilization 3 of patient -centered, mobile resources to deliver care in the out -of-hospital environment, including 4 services such as telephone advice to 9 -1-1 callers (instead of resource dispatch), paramedicine 5 care, chronic disease management, preventive care, and post -discharge follow -up visits.3 6 7 To date, there is a limited body of research surrounding the use of community paramedicine as a 8 safe, effective, and cost -saving means of improving the delivery of high -quality healthcare to 9 underserved areas. Some large observational and retrospective studies have shown promise in 10 mobile integrated healthcare as a cost -effective and efficient avenue of interest for policymakers,1-11 3 Additional rigorous, high -quality studies are needed to better parse out the potential impact of 12 community paramedicine and mobile integrated healthcare. 13 14 In 2017, the AMA House of Delegates (HOD) adopted the following policies, evidently supporting 15 an improvement in ambulance and emergency medi cal services - Medicare's Ambulance Service 16 Regulations H -240.978:6 17 18 1. Our AMA supports changes in Medicare regulations governing ambulance service 19 coverage guidelines that would expand the term \"appropriate facility\" to allow full payment 20 for transport to t he most appropriate facility based on the patient's needs and the 21 determination made by physician medical direction; and expand the list of eligible transport 22 locations from the current three sites of care (nearest hospital, critical access hospital, or 23 skilled nursing facility) based upon the onsite evaluation and physician medical direction. 24 25 2. Our AMA will work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) to pay 26 emergency medical services providers for the evaluation and transport of patients to the 27 most appropriate site of care not limited to the current CMS defined transport locations. 28 29 Beginning in January of 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) will be 30 conducting a five -year study entitled Emergency Triage, Treat, and Tran sport (ET3). The CMS 31 will pay participating Medicare -enrolled ambulance suppliers and hospital -owned ambulance 32 providers to 1) transport an individual to a hospital emergency department or other destination 33 covered under the regulations, 2) transport to an alternative destination (such as a primary care 34 doctor's office or an urgent care clinic), or 3) provide treatment in place with a qualified health 35 care practitioner, either on the scene or connected using telehealth.7 The ET3 will study the health 36 outcomes and seek to improve quality and lower costs by reducing avoidable transports to the 37 emergency department and unnecessary hospitalizations following these transports. This study 38 will be the first of its kind and will help provide findings on how and whether community 39 paramedicine and mobile integrated healthcare services can make healthcare delivery more 40 efficient. 41 42 DISCUSSION 43 44 AMA -MSS Resolution 28 asks for research by the AMA -MSS into mobile medical units to help 45 improve healthcare delivery into underserved communities, which is on par with the current efforts 46 of large organizations, including CMS. However, as noted by some tes timony, the AMA is not a 47 research institution, and the AMA HOD has also shown its support for improving emergency 48 medical services transport through the recent adoption of HOD Resolution H -240.978. 49 Furthermore, CMS has set up and is launching their new ET3 initiatives in coordination with a 1 number of ambulance suppliers and local governments nationwide in less than a year. 2 3 RECOMMENDATIONS 4 Your Committee on Economics and Quality in Medicine recognizes this research on mobile 5 medical units recommends that t he remainder of this report is filed: 6 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS References: Community Paramedicine Pilot Program.

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON GLOBAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH CGPH Report A A-19 Subject : Efficacy of Food Prescriptions and Hospital -Based Food Assistance Programs in Addressing Food Insecurity in the U.S. Presented by : MSS Committee on Global and Public Health Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) INTRODUCTION 1 2 At its Interim 2018 meeting, the AMA -MSS referred for study MSS Resolution 51 titled \"Utilizing 3 Food Insecurity Screenings in the Emergency Medical Setting to Identify At -Risk Individuals\", 4 which states the following: 5 6 RESOLVED, That our AMA -MSS study the effectiveness of food prescriptions and hospital 7 based food assistance programs for those patients identified as food insecur e. 8 9 The reference committee noted concerns of feasibility. Specifically , it was noted that it is not 10 within the purview of the AMA to dictate hospital practices, protocols, and partnerships. 11 Additionally, the sources in the whereas clauses of Resolution 5 1 were not found adequate to 12 support the resolved without further study. As a result, your Governing Council assigned this 13 report to the Committee of Global and Public Health (CGPH). 14 15 In this report we begin by defining food insecurity as it is used in na tional screening and 16 establish the implications of food insecurity in regards to public health in the United States as 17 mentioned in Resolution 51. This report then elaborates on the efficacy of existing food 18 prescriptions and hospital -based food assistance programs. Finally, we offer recommendations 19 for AMA -MSS policy and action. 20 21 BACKGROUND 22 23 1.Definitions 24 25 The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines \"food insecurity\" as \"the limited or 26 uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to 27 acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways.\"1 The USDA has established a four -tiered 28 categorization based on reported conditions through a food security survey: (1) high food 29 security where there are \"no reported indications of food -access problems or limitations,\"2 (2) 30 Table of Contents Next Previousmarginal food security with \"one or two reported indications - typically of anxiety over food 1 sufficiency or shortage of food in the house - (and) little or no indication of changes in diets or 2 food intake,\"2 (3) low food security with \"reports of reduced quality, variety, or desirability of diet 3 (and) little or no indication of reduced food intake,\"2 (4) very low food security with \"reports of 4 multiple indications of disrupted eating pa tterns and reduced food intake.\"2 It also distinguishes 5 food insecurity from \"hunger,\" which is \"an individual -level physiological condition that may 6 result from food insecurity.\"2 It is important to note that a vast majority of studies on food 7 insecurity in the United States use the USDA definition of food insecurity. This suggests a 8 moderately standardized approach to current literature on this issue in the U.S. and in the data 9 collected in this report. 10 11 \"Food prescriptions\" refer to instances where heal thcare providers write patients prescriptions 12 for food to be obtained at a food -distributing location such as a grocery store or farmers market. 13 Food prescription programs typically involve participating clinics and food distributors. They offer 14 financial incentives for patients to purchase and consume the foods prescribed.2 Different 15 programs utilize unique stakeholders and incentivization systems. Throughout this report, \"food 16 prescription programs\" will refer to a collaboration between healthcare entitie s and food retailers 17 to encourage participating patients to consume foods of a selected diet. 18 19 2. Context 20 21 In 2017, 11.8% (15.0 million) of U.S. households were found to be food insecure with 7.3% 22 being in the \"low food security\" stratum and 4.5% being in t he \"very low food security\" stratum.4 23 Because of the inherently decreased ability of food insecure people to consume a balanced diet, 24 food insecurity is affiliated with chronic conditions such as inflammation5, diabetes6, chronic 25 kidney disease7, and hyper tension8. Food insecurity has been shown to significantly impact 26 health outcomes for children as well as adults that experience it when compared to their food 27 secure counterparts. These include increased risks for asthma, anemia, cognitive problems, and 28 aggression and anxiety.9 For these reasons, food security status is a condition that has been 29 identified for preventative health objectives at local, regional, and national levels.3 30 31 It is appropriate to examine hospital -based food assistance and food presc ription programs \u2014 32 specifically fruit and vegetable prescription programs \u2014in the context of addressing food 33 insecurity. While they typically aim to address specific chronic conditions, they do so by 34 targeting factors that are fundamental to food insecurity: financial prioritization, food availability 35 in retail environments, and nutrition education.10 Because hospitals and healthcare providers 36 tend to be trusted by their patients, they have been targeted with increasing frequency as 37 entities that are well -suited to connect eligible patients to food assistance programs who may 38 otherwise be either insecure or uneducated about participation.11 This report seeks to examine 39 the efficacy of these programs toward their originally intended goals and then re -contextuali ze 40 them to consider whether sufficient evidence exists for the AMA to support actions that would 41 broaden their implementation. 42 43 3. Food Insecurity in the Emergency Medical Setting 44 45 The prevalence of food insecurity is several -fold greater (38%) among adults presenting to 1 emergency departments (ED) in urban areas than it is among the general population (12%) .12 2 Higher rates of food insecurity have been found in the pediatric population presenting to the ED. 3 Additionally, the percentage of these patients with food insecurity is substantially higher than the 4 general population .13 This disparity is likely due to the important function of the ED as a safety 5 net provider for those with limited access to care, thus making it a particularly valuable 6 environment to provide screening and services. 7 8 4. Previous AMA Actions 9 10 In previous years, the AMA has reaffirmed support of efforts that reduce health disparities by 11 basing food assistance programs on the health needs of their constituents (H -150.944). The 12 AMA has urged legislators at both the state and national levels to continue to support initiatives 13 related to federal nutrition programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program 14 (SNAP) and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for W omen, Infants, and Children 15 (WIC). These programs aim to reduce food insecurity and improve health in economically 16 disadvantaged populations through increased funds, more adequate benefits and increased 17 enrollment (H -150.937, D -150.983). Furthermore, the A MA expressed their disapproval towards 18 amendment proposals to the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (commonly referred to as the 19 Farm Bill) that would have weakened the provisions of the SNAP and WIC programs and would 20 have affected 2 million SNAP recipi ents.14,15 Of note, the amendments were ultimately excluded 21 from the final text of the 2018 Farm Bill, which was signed into law. 22 23 Under the umbrella of food and nutrition policy, the AMA has already established efforts t owards 24 studying the national preva lence, impact, and solutions to the problems of food mirages, food 25 swamps, and food oases as food environments distinct from food deserts (H -150.925). There 26 has also been considerable AMA advocacy for the implementation of higher quality nutritional 27 food o ptions in elementary schools, medical schools, hospitals, health care facilities, and at 28 AMA functions (D -150.975, D -150.978, H -150.949, H -150.960, H-150.964 ). Furthermore, 29 previous AMA policy has advocated for stronger counseling by healthcare profession als and 30 nutrition experts to educate patients on how to maintain more nutrition -conscious lifestyles in 31 order to reduce negative health outcomes, including supporting payments for nutrition services 32 (H-150.990, H -150.931,H -150.953, D -150.977, D -440.978). E stablished policies such as these 33 emphasize the importance, as deemed by this AMA, of food and nutrition counseling in 34 preventative health and disease management. 35 36 In regards to food security within marginalized populations, the AMA previously issued a 37 directive that expresses its opposition to any proposed rule, regulations, or policy that would 38 deter immigrants and/or their dependents from utilizing non -cash benefits from programs such 39 as SNAP and WIC (D -440.927). Additionally, with regards to children, the AMA opposes 40 legislation and regulatory initiatives that reduce or eliminate access to federal child nutrition 41 programs (H -150.962). These policies advocate for increased accessibility of nutrition services 42 and further emphasize the importance of food c ounseling in reducing negative health outcomes 43 in susceptible populations. 44 1 Although major successful advocacy efforts by the AMA have been directed towards federal 2 nutrition assistance programs and implementation of more nutrition -rich diets in various s ettings, 3 notably schools and hospitals, there has been no policy established that addresses the 4 effectiveness of food prescriptions and hospital -based assistance programs as a means to 5 reduce food insecurity. 6 7 METHODS 8 9 Your CGPH conducted a systematic re view of food assistance programs and food prescriptions 10 using PubMed, MEDLINE, and Google Scholar for studies and reports published after 1985. 11 Search terms included food insecurity, food assistance, food prescriptions, food banks, food 12 mirage, food access ibility, food desert, food oasis, nutrition, nutrition counseling, hospital food 13 assistance, SNAP, WIC, and chronic disease. Relevant AMA policy was identified using the 14 same terms in the AMA Policy Finder to provide context of previous and future avenues for 15 progress. The AMA Correspondence Finder was also explored for correspondences on the 16 topics examined. Each identified study was then analyzed by committee members and reported 17 in regards to background, impact on health outcomes, and efficacy. 18 19 RESULTS 20 21 1. Initiatives Addressing U.S. Food Insecurity 22 23 Food insecurity has always played a consistent role in public health, impacting every community 24 in the U.S. Historically, this was understood as a social problem, however recent advancements 25 in our understan ding of the impact of social determinants on population health have transformed 26 the practice of medicine. Given that only 20% of health outcomes are attributed to medical care 27 while social and economic factors comprise 40%, the role of addressing social de terminants like 28 food insecurity is vital to improving the health of communities and patients.16 While private and 29 community efforts have comprised initial programs to alleviate food insecurity, federal and 30 hospital programs have been implemented to address this need on a larger scale. 31 32 2. Hospital -based Food Assistance Programs 33 34 To address the multifaceted causes of food insecurity, hospital initiatives have been 35 implemented and examined across the United States. Programs providing services such as 36 screening in the electronic medical record, assistance in SNAP and WIC registration, medically 37 tailored meals (MTM), food banks, and food prescriptions have been implemented and studied. 38 The efficacy and impact of these programs are discussed below. 39 40 a. Food Insec urity Screening Programs 41 42 In order to screen for households that may benefit from food assistance, a commonly -used tool 43 in the electronic medical record is the Children's HealthWatch Hunger Vital Sign, which is based 44 on the U.S. Household Food Security Survey Module and validated for use among youth and 1 adults.18,19 This tool asks respondents the following questions: 1) Within the past 12 months, we 2 worried whether our food would run out before we got money to buy more, and 2) Within the 3 past 12 months, the food we bought just didn't last and we didn't have money to get more.18 It 4 has been tested with both tablets and verbal interviews among caregivers of pediatric patients in 5 emergency departments and primary care sites, with results showing a preference for tablet - 6 based screening and higher rates of food insecurity detected through the tablet format as well.20 7 More respondents expressed comfort with screening in the emergency department than 8 physicians' offices, although rates were high for both. A scree ning tool has also been integrated 9 into an inpatient admission database at ProMedica, a non -profit health system in Ohio. Patients 10 who screen positive are connected to social workers and discharged with packages consisting 11 of dietician -designed meals and a guide to community food assistance resources.19 The results 12 of these programs show the ease with which screening tools can be integrated into existing 13 hospital programs to identify patients who can benefit from food assistance. 14 15 b. Link to Government Ass istance Programs 16 17 Hospital -based assistance programs have also been designed to connect patients with federal 18 nutrition programs like SNAP and WIC. These programs are currently underutilized, as only 19 61% of food -insecure households use these benefits.19 To increase utilization, some hospitals 20 have set up on -site offices to help patients apply for WIC benefits and food stamps. While these 21 offices have tracked hundreds of visits from patients, data on the specific impact of these 22 hospital programs on food in security is lacking.19 Overall, the impact of federal programs like 23 SNAP is mixed; while they enable participants to purchase more food, dietary quality of the food 24 may not be improved.21,22 Surveys of food -insecure individuals have shown support for metho ds 25 of improving the nutritional impact of SNAP, such as through nutrition education, incentives for 26 fruits and vegetables, restricting purchases of sugary beverages, and increasing total 27 benefits.23,24 Nonetheless, SNAP has been shown to be associated with lower estimated annual 28 health care expenditures and reduced likelihood of hospitalization, but not emergency 29 department use.25,26 30 31 c. Medically Tailored Meals 32 33 Several hospitals have implemented MTMs as a targeted food and nutrition service to assist 34 high-risk patients. These patients have severe or chronic illnesses who are unable to cook for 35 themselves and, therefore, are at greater risk of malnutrition, complications, and readmission. 36 MTMs are designed by registered dietitians as part of a holistic tr eatment plan for high risk, high 37 cost patients.27 These meals are designed to precisely address the medical needs of the patient 38 per their diagnoses and delivered to their home.27 MTMs have been shown to lower mean 39 monthly healthcare costs, in addition to decreased hospital admissions and shorter lengths of 40 stay for patients with complex medical conditions. An increase in discharges to patient homes in 41 comparison to long -term care or subacute rehabilitation facilities has also been observed.28 A 42 recent rand omized controlled trial demonstrated improved food security and health outcomes in 43 patient populations such as diabetics and individuals with HIV, in addition to improved mental 44 health in association to improved health -related quality of life.29,30 Patient s were found to have 1 greater adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and fewer sacrificed food for healthcare or 2 prescriptions.30 While active MTM programs exist in urban U.S. cities, barriers are more 3 significant in rural settings and include funding constra ints, coverage, and implementation as an 4 accessible service to a full spectrum of patients. 5 6 d. Food Banks 7 8 Public assistance services such as food banks, community kitchens and subsidized community 9 markets play a role in addressing the food insecurity g ap. However, these programs typically 10 serve as a short -term solution to food insecurity in socioeconomically challenged 11 communities.31,32 Often emergency food aid efforts are comprised of food bank programs which 12 offer two types of services: the large redi stribution of cooked and uncooked food or a service 13 directly providing grocery items to those food insecure.33 A systematic review examining the 14 efficacy of food banks found these services to be used increasingly by those experiencing short 15 and long term f ood insecurity, yet often continued to leave many food insecure. Three causal 16 reasons have been identified in failure of food banks to address client need: (1) food bank 17 clients continue to increase as (2) donations do not increase with demand or are inapp ropriate 18 for community need, and (3) food bank staff lack adequate training to provide nutritional 19 education to clients. Additionally, findings suggest that food banks are often unable to meet the 20 nutritional requirements of those in need. Specifically, it has been shown that requirements for 21 milk, protein, and micronutrients such as vitamin A and C are often unfulfilled.34,35 Given the 22 aforementione d challenges , food banks may ease food insecurity yet are often unable to 23 address the nutritional needs of fo od insecure patients. Systematic methods to collect food with 24 adequate nutrients and staff education will be required to improve the capacity to address food 25 insecurity. 26 27 e. Food Prescription Programs 28 29 The concept of \"food prescriptions\" is a relatively recent phenomenon which was conceived as a 30 rebuttal to the complexity and interdisciplinary nature of care required to better address 31 situations of chronic disease. Food prescription programs have taken many forms, but by 32 principle, they seek to address th e nutritional deficits in patients which are foundational to 33 successful care plans and primary prevention of disease. The philosophy of food prescription 34 programs is that healthful food is prescribed by physicians (and other health providers) with 35 equivale nt importance to care as prescribing medications, referring to specialists, or ordering 36 procedures or operations. Nutritional health, according to this framework, is as important of a 37 factor of medical management as any other intervention - if not more. A food prescription 38 program seeks to put the prescription of \"good food\" directly into the hands of the medical 39 provider. This emphasizes the importance of a healthful diet in part, but more importantly 40 increases patients' access to good food and indirectly reduces the cost of a healthful diet. 41 42 Several successful food prescription programs are compared below. 43 44 Case Western University's Produce Prescription Program for Hypertension (PRxHTN) - 1 Cleveland, Ohio 2 PRxHTN is a clinical -community linkage intervention that provided patients with hypertension 3 from three safety net clinics in Ohio with produce prescription vouchers to twenty partnering 4 farmers markets. 266 patients were screened using the 2 -question Hunger Vit al Sign and 224 5 were enrolled. At each program visit, patients had their blood pressure measured, received 6 targeted nutrition counselling, and received four $10 vouchers for produce at the farmers 7 markets. By the post -program visits at month 3, 88% of pati ents reported increased visits to 8 farmers markets and 95% said they would continue to shop there. Daily fruit and vegetable 9 consumption increased, although this was not found to be associated with measures for farmers 10 market visits and voucher redemption. A decrease in fast food consumption was also 11 observed.34 12 13 Boston Medical Center's Preventive Food Pantry - Boston, Massachusetts 14 The Preventive Food Pantry at Boston Medical Center was initially created in 2001 to assist 15 pediatric patients and pregnant wo men facing food insecurity. It was expanded over the years to 16 eventually serve all food -insecure patients in the hospital, identified through screening upon 17 outpatient visit or inpatient admission. Those who screened positive received a prescription and 18 referral to the pantry. The pantry is sustained through donations from the Greater Boston Food 19 Bank and other community organizations. It assists about 7000 patients per month and provides 20 them with a three - or four -day supply of food twice a month. About 15 ,000 pounds of food is 21 distributed weekly.19 22 23 Food Prescription Pharmacy: ProMedica - Toledo, Ohio 24 ProMedica is a non -profit organization whose mission is to reduce food insecurity in 25 northwestern Ohio and southeastern Michigan. They have several innovati ve programs aiming 26 to tackle food insecurity, one of which focuses on food prescription programs. They have two 27 food prescription pharmacies in Toledo for patients who have screened \"positive\" on their food 28 insecurity screening. Patients visiting the pharm acies are able to obtain several days' supply of 29 food for their entire family and are able to utilize the pharmacy once a month for up to six 30 months. (Patients are able to obtain a new prescription from a prescribing provider for another 31 six-month food pha rmacy subscription.) The pharmacies work with local hospitals to ensure 32 their food regimens are compliant with disease -specific diets, and a registered dietitian is 33 available to provide free nutrition counseling for utilizers. Currently, ProMedica screens up to 34 51% of patients receiving primary care in the Toledo area. Following the development of the 35 Toledo food pharmacies, the community has seen a three percent decrease in the number of 36 emergency department visits amongst food pharmacy utilizers, 53% redu ction in readmission 37 rates, and a four percent increase in primary care visits after implementing the food insecurity 38 screening process.36 39 40 Access of West Michigan's Nutritional Options for Wellness (NOW) Program - Kent County, 41 Michigan 42 The mission of Acc ess of West Michigan is to \"strengthen and develop holistic solutions to 43 poverty by cultivating equitable systems through education and collaboration.\" Their NOW 44 program provides clients with healthful living classes and increased food system connections t o 1 increase the quality and availability of cost -conscious, healthful food. The organization has 2 partnered with a local health organization, Spectrum Health (based in Grand Rapids, Michigan) 3 to prescribe healthful food to eligible patients (those with chron ic disease, between the ages of 4 18 and 65) who are cared for within participating community clinics. The program also sponsors 5 chronic disease self -management classes and healthful cooking classes. From 2004 to 2008, 6 their program boasted a 26.4% decrease in emergency department visits, 44% reduction in 7 hospitalization, improved levels of albumin, glucose, potassium, triglycerides, high -density 8 lipoprotein (HDL) and cholesterol, and significant weight reduction in clients who completed the 9 program. Addition ally, the NOW program saw reductions in the averages of diastolic blood 10 pressure, HbA1c, and low -density lipoprotein (LDL) in clients who completed the program.37 11 12 Wholesome Wave's Fruit and Veggie Prescription (FVRx) Program - multiple states (48) 13 Wholes ome Wave is a non -profit organization whose primary aim is to reduce the cost of 14 healthful foods by advocating for (1) more federal funding for SNAP and (2) increased provider 15 buy-in for writing food prescriptions. They are a federally funded, award -winnin g program whose 16 work has expanded to 48 American states. In 2016 the FVRx program measured a 206% 17 increase in the vegetable servings consumed by their community. Per their food insecurity 18 questionnaire, they noted a 38% decrease in self -reported food insec urity within their 19 community. 93% of the patients enrolled in their program met national food consumption 20 guidelines by the end of the program. 57% of respondent participants agreed that the program 21 had a positive impact on their children's health.38 22 23 University of Chicago's Food Rx Program - South Chicago, Illinois 24 Food Rx is a collaborative food -prescription program developed by the University of Chicago, 25 Walgreens, a farmer 's market, and six health centers. Physicians provided diabetic patients with 26 a prescription, a coupon, nutritional information, and a map of locations where their coupon 27 could be redeemed. Although only preliminary lessons from the program have been published 28 thus far without direct measures of effectiveness, the publication provided a roadmap for parties 29 interested in forming their own food prescription network. The study highlights some of the 30 integrative relationships important for a successful food prescription program, including the 31 importance of the involvement of local farmer ma rkets, pharmacies, hospitals, and other social 32 welfare programs.39 33 34 f. Additional Readings on Food Prescription Programs 35 Many other food prescription programs were not included in this report due to their limited 36 scope, although the concept of food prescr iption programs is supported through these papers. 37 One particularly enlightening study summarizing the ethical considerations of a significant 38 number of food prescription programs is found in a 2018 AMA Journal of Ethics discussion 39 entitled \"Produce Rx Pro grams for Diet -Based Chronic Disease Prevention\".40 40 41 DISCUSSION 42 43 Food insecurity is a significant obstacle that many Americans face in achieving good health. 1 Factors impacting food security are strongly related to those that food prescription programs 2 and hospital -based food assistance programs seek to address. 3 4 Although food prescription programs have not been well studied due to the fact that the concept 5 of food prescriptions is relatively novel, some studies have indicated promising results with 6 regard to effectiveness. The programs studied within this report indicate potential for lowered 7 cost and utilization of hospital services, perception of increased quality and quantity of healthful 8 foods consumed, and improved serum levels of several metabolic markers of health. Very few 9 studies report specific measures relevant to effectiveness; overall, most of the research on food 10 prescription programs serve as \"case reports\" of a promising approach to addressing food 11 insecurity. More large -scale studies whi ch better control for confounding variables and biases 12 should be conducted before any hard conclusions are made on the effectiveness of food 13 prescription programs. 14 15 While there have been many programs targeting food insecurity, several of which are discus sed 16 in this report, it is important to take caution and/or care to several points regarding food 17 prescription programs: 18 19 1. Publications recording the success of community programs is significantly biased in that 20 there are a disproportionate number of reporte d successful programs to the number of 21 reported unsuccessful programs; to provide conclusive discussion of the unsuccessful 22 food prescription programs would be impossible. It is important not to sensationalize 23 novel program labels such as \"food prescriptio n programs.\" A more thoughtful and 24 successful approach would be to recognize that there are a significant number of 25 programs which, largely due to their infrastructure, serve as successful models for 26 addressing food insecurity through the unique avenue of food prescription programs . 27 28 2. Food prescription programs take a highly integrative approach and require significant, 29 multi -enterprise buy -in. The synergy behind the success of food prescription programs 30 cannot be ignored when considering the inception of ne w food prescription programs. 31 The University of Chicago's Food Rx program, for example, required buy -in from 32 Walgreens (a nationwide pharmacy company), local farmer's markets, hospitals, and 33 other social programs throughout the city, many of which are busi nesses unique to 34 Chicago (although such businesses exist in concept in many other cities). 35 36 Several hospital -based food assistance programs have shown promising results on the status of 37 food insecurity and health outcomes in high -risk populations. Targete d initiatives such as 38 medically tailored meals have demonstrated improved health outcomes through greater 39 treatment adherence and food security in the setting of high -risk, food insecure patients. The 40 positive results demonstrated in these studies indicate lower healthcare costs and 41 readmissions, in addition to improved patient outcomes, providing an incentive for 42 implementation in U.S. hospitals. Other hospital -based initiatives, such as food banks and 43 emergency food aid have not shown to effectively addre ss food insecurity. The benefit of these 44 services has been limited to short term improvement of food insecurity, however studies 1 address a failure to resolve food insecurity and a lack of nutritious foods. 2 3 Food insecurity screening has been found to be f easible and acceptable to patients in both 4 hospital and clinic settings. While hospital -based services to assist with enrolling in federal 5 nutrition programs like SNAP and WIC have been accessed by many patients, the impact of 6 these services on food insecu rity is unclear. Additional studies are necessary to warrant the 7 need for implementation in the hospital setting. 8 9 Currently, the AMA does not have any existing policy acknowledging food prescription 10 programs, medically -tailored meals, or hospital -based f ood assistance programs. The AMA has, 11 however, expressed support and action for social services addressing food insecurity including 12 SNAP and WIC, and has reaffirmed support for protection of social services such as Medicare, 13 Medicaid, Children's Health In surance Program (CHIP), and Temporary Assistance for Needy 14 Families (TANF), whose recipients often qualify or are already beneficiaries of food assistance 15 programs. Preliminary results on food assistance programs such as food prescriptions and 16 MTMs have be en promising and demonstrated positive health impacts. 17 18 Food insecurity is a complex issue affecting population health at many levels. Recent advances 19 in our understanding of the significant impact of food insecurity on the health of individuals and 20 commu nities have driven hospitals to address nutrition and access as a significant medical 21 issue. 22 23 As novel methods to address food insecurity arise, research has shown promise in the impact of 24 food prescriptions and medically tailored meals in improving healt h outcomes, reducing 25 readmission rates, and reducing healthcare expenditures. As food assistance services begin to 26 grow in size and scope, interdisciplinary coordination between clinicians, researchers and the 27 community is necessary for the implementation of effective programs, for which studies have 28 shown a positive impact on health outcomes and a decrease in healthcare expenditures. 29 30 RECOMMENDATION: 31 32 Your Committee on Global and Public Health recommends that the following recommendations 33 are adopted an d the remainder of this report is filed: 34 35 RESOLVED , That our AMA -MSS support evidence -based methods of addressing food 36 insecurity including food prescription programs and medically -tailored meals. 37 38 REFERENCES: 1.

Appendix Chart (A) Comprehensive AMA - MSS Policies Relevant to CGPH Report on MS 51 Reform the US Farm Bill to Improve US Public Health and Food Sustainability (H -150.932) Our AMA supports the creation of a new advisory board to review and reco mmend US Farm Bill budget allocations to ensure any government subsidies are only used to help produce healthy food choices and sustainable foods, and that advisory committee members include physicians, public health officials and other public health stake holders. Combating Obesity and Health Disparities H -150.944 Our AMA supports efforts to: (1) reduce health disparities by basing food assistance programs on the health needs of their constituents; (2) provide vegetables, fruits, legumes, grains, vegetarian foods, and healthful dairy and nondairy beverages in school lunches and food assistance programs; and (3) ensure that federal subsidies encourage the consumption of foods and beverages low in fat, added sugars, and cholesterol. Improvements to Supplemental Nutrition Programs (H -150.937): (1) Our AMA supports: (a) improvements to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) that are designed to promote adequate nutrient intake and reduce food insecurity and obesity; (b) efforts to decrease the price gap between calorie -dense, nutrition - poor foods and naturally nutrition -dense foods to improve health in economically disadvantaged populations by encouragin g the expansion, through increased funds and increased enrollment, of existing programs that seek to improve nutrition and reduce obesity, such as the Farmer's Market Nutrition Program as a part of the Women, Infants, and Children program; and (c) the nove l application of the Farmer's Market Nutrition Program to existing programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and apply program models that incentivize the consumption of naturally nutrition -dense foods in wider food distributio n venues than solely farmer's markets as part of the Women, Infants, and Children program. (2) Our AMA will request that the federal government support SNAP initiatives to (a) incentivize healthful foods and disincentivize or eliminate unhealthful food s and (b) harmonize SNAP food offerings with those of WIC. (3) Our AMA will actively lobby Congress to preserve and protect the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through the reauthorization of the 2018 Farm Bill in order for Americans to live h ealthy and productive lives. Eligibility of Sugar -Sweetened Beverages for SNAP (D -150.975): Our AMA will: (1) publish an educational brief to educate physicians about the effects of sugar -sweetened beverages (SSBs) on obesity and overall health, and encourage them to educate their patients in turn (2) encourage state health agencies to include educational materials about nutrition and healthy food and beverage choices in routine materials that are currently sent to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Pr ogram (SNAP) recipients along with the revised eligible foods and beverages guidelines, and (3) work to remove SSBs from SNAP. Opposition to Regulations That Penalize Immigrants for Accessing Health Care Services (D -440.927) : Our AMA will, upon the releas e of a proposed rule, regulations, or policy that would deter immigrants and/or their dependents from utilizing non -cash public benefits including but not limited to Medicaid, CHIP, WIC, and SNAP, issue a formal comment expressing its opposition. Food Env ironments and Challenges Accessing Healthy Food (H -150.925) Our AMA encourages the U.S. Department of Agriculture and appropriate stakeholders to study the national prevalence, impact, and solutions to the problems of food mirages, food swamps, and food oa ses as food environments distinct from food deserts. Improving Nutritional Value of Snack Foods Available in Primary and Secondary Schools (H -150.960) The AMA supports the position that primary and secondary schools should follow federal nutrition standards that replace foods in vending machines and snack bars, that are of low nutritional value and are high in fat, salt and/or sugar, including sugar -sweetened beverages, with healthier food and beverage choices that contribute to the nutritional need s of the students. Healthy Food Options in Hospitals (H -150.949) 1. Our AMA encourages healthy food options be available, at reasonable prices and easily accessible, on hospital premises. 2. Our AMA hereby calls on US hospitals to improve the health of pa tients, staff, and visitors by: (a) providing a variety of healthy food, including plant -based meals, and meals that are low in fat, sodium, and added sugars; (b) eliminating processed meats from menus; and (c) providing and promoting healthy beverages. 3. Our AMA hereby calls for hospital cafeterias and inpatient meal menus to publish nutrition information. Sustainable Food D -150.978 Our AMA: (1) supports practices and policies in medical schools, hospitals, and other health care facilities that support and model a healthy and ecologically sustainable food system, which provides food and beverages of naturally high nutritional quality; (2) encourages the development of a healthier food system through tax incentive programs, community -level initiatives and federal legislation; and (3) will consider working with other health care and public health organizations to educate the health care community and the public about the importance of healthy and ecologically sustainable food systems. Food Stamp Incentive P rogram D -150.983. \"Our AMA supports legislation to provide a meaningful increase in the value of food stamps when used to purchase fruits and vegetables.\" Encouraging Healthy Eating Behaviors in Children Through Corporate Responsibility (D -150.977) Our AMA: 1) will work with appropriate agencies, organizations, and corporations to educate health professionals and the public about healthy food choices in fast food restaurants; and 2) supports personal andparental responsibility to encourage healthy ch ildhood behaviors, including the consumption of healthy food. Sodium in Processed Foods H -150.990 Our AMA will: (1) Call for a step -wise, minimum 50% reduction in sodium in processed foods, fast food products, andrestaurant meals to be achieved over the n ext decade. Food manufacturers and restaurants should review their product lines and reduce sodium levels to the greatest extent possible (without increasing levels of other unhealthy ingredients). Gradual but steady reductions over several years may be th e most effective way to minimize sodium levels. (2) To assist in achieving the Healthy People 2010 goal for sodium consumption, will work with the FDA, the National Heart Lung Blood Institute, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Heart Association, and other interested partners to educate consumers about the benefits of long -term, moderate reductions in sodium intake. (3) Recommend that the FDA consider all options to promote reductions in the sodium content of processed foods. Payment for Nutrition Support Services H -150.931 Our AMA recognizes the value of nutrition support teams services and their role in positive patient outcomes and supports payment for the provision of their services. Availability of Heart -Healthy and Healt h-Promoting Foods at AMA Functions H -150.964 The AMA and its constituent medical societies strive to make heart -healthy and other health -promoting foods available as options at all functions. Quality of School Lunch Program H -150.962 1. Our AMA recommends to the National School Lunch Program that school meals be congruent with current U.S. Department of Agriculture/Department of HHS Dietary Guidelines. 2. Our AMA opposes legislation and regulatory initiatives that reduce or eliminate access to federal chil d nutrition programs. Culturally Responsive Dietary and Nutritional Guidelines D -440.978 1. Our AMA and its Minority Affairs Section will: (a) encourage the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to include culturally effective guidelines that inc lude listing an array of ethnic staples and use of multicultural symbols to depict serving size in their Dietary Guidelines for Americans and Food Guide; (b) seek ways to assist physicians with applying the USDA Dietary Guidelines for Americans and MyPlate food guide in their practices as appropriate; (c) recognize that lactose intolerance is a common and normal condition among many Americans, especially African Americans, Asian Americans, and Native Americans, with a lower prevalence in whites, often manif esting in childhood; and (d) monitor existing research and identify opportunities where organized medicine can impact issues related to obesity, nutritional and dietary guidelines, racial and ethnic health disparities as well as assist physicians with delivering culturally effective care. 2. Our AMA will: (a) propose legislation that modifies the National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1758, so as to eliminate requirements that children produce documentation of a disability or a special medical or dietary ne ed in order to receive an alternative to cow's milk; and (b) recommend that the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services clearly indicate in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and other federal nutrition guidelines that meat and dairy products are optional, based on an individual's dietary needs. Obesity as a Major Public Health Problem H -150.953 Our AMA will: (1) urge physicians as well as managed care organizations and other third party payers to recognize obesity as a complex disorder involving appetite regulation and energy metabolism that is associated with a variety of comorbid conditions; (2) work with appropriate federal agencies, medical specialty societies, and public health organizations to educate physici ans about the prevention and management of overweight and obesity in children and adults, including education in basic principles and practices of physical activity and nutrition counseling; such training should be included in undergraduate and graduate me dical education and through accredited continuing medical education programs; (3) urge federal support of research to determine: (a) the causes and mechanisms of overweight and obesity, including biological, social, and epidemiological influences on weight gain, weight loss, and weight maintenance; (b) the long - term safety and efficacy of voluntary weight maintenance and weight loss practices and therapies, including surgery; (c) effective interventions to prevent obesity in children and adults; and (d) the effectiveness of weight loss counseling by physicians; (4) encourage national efforts to educate the public about the health risks of being overweight and obese andprovide information about how to achieve and maintain a preferred healthy weight; (5) urge physicians to assess their patients for overweight and obesity during routine medical examinations and discuss with at -risk patients the health consequences of further weight gain; if treatment is indicated, physicians should encourage and facilitate weigh t maintenance or reduction efforts in their patients or refer them to a physician with special interest and expertise in the clinical management of obesity; (6) urge all physicians and patients to maintain a desired weight and prevent inappropriate weight gain; (7) encourage physicians to become knowledgeable of community resources and referral services that can assist with the management of overweight and obese patients; and (8) urge the appropriate federal agencies to work with organized medicine and the health insurance industry to develop coding and payment mechanisms for the evaluation and management of obesity. REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON GLOBAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH MSS CGPH Report B A-19 Subject : Encouraging Stocking Epinephrine Auto Injector Devices at Restaurants Presented by : MSS Committee on Global and Public Health Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) ____________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 Interim meeting, the AMA -MSS referred for study MSS Resolution 33 - \"Encouraging 3 Stocking Epinephrine Auto -Injector Devices at Restaurants\" which states the following: 4 5 RESOLVED, that our AMA support the stocking of epinephrine auto-injector de vices in standard 6 first aid kits in food service establishments 7 8 RESOLVED, our AMA support having employees that are educated in the signs of anaphylaxis 9 10 RESOLVED, that AMA Policy D -440.932 be amended by addition to read as follows: 11 12 Preventing Allergic Reactions in Food Service Establishments D -440.932 13 14 Our American Medical Association will pursue federal legislation requiring 15 restaurants and food establishments to: (1) include a notice in menus reminding 16 customers to let the staff know of any food allergies; (2) educate their staff 17 regarding common food allergens and the need to remind customers to inform wait 18 staff of any allergies; and (3) identify menu items which contain any of the major 19 food allergens identified by the FDA (in the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer 20 Protection Act of 2004) and which allergens the menu item contains; and (4) 21 encourage restaurants to keep epinephrine auto -injector devices in their standard 22 first aid kit and encourage having employees trained in the signs of anaphylaxis. 23 24 During the assembly at I -18, testimony was given stating that while the Reference committee 25 had valid concerns, the issue was too important to not be further investigated. Your assembly 26 found this compelling. 27 28 Staff experts in Chronic Disease Prevention expressed the following in regard to Resolution 05 - 29 I-18: 30 31 Concern was noted that this would be ineffective without training employees, and/or emphasis 32 on training employees could potentially be a more successful solution. Concern was also noted 33 regarding the cost and feasibility of the resolved. 34 Table of Contents Next Previous 1 BACKGRO UND 2 3 Epinephrine auto -injectors are used in the community setting to significantly improve outcomes 4 of anaphylaxis and reduce risk of death. Auto -injectors are used to deliver measured doses of 5 epinephrine intramuscularly. Reasons for not utilizing the au to-injectors include lack of 6 availability and concerns over safety of use. The most common cause of anaphylaxis is food - 7 related, and anaphylaxis can occur without prior knowledge of food allergy.1 Consequences of 8 anaphylaxis can be deadly if not treated properly. 9 10 Anaphylaxis incidence is estimated to be between 50 and 112 episodes per 100,000 people per 11 year, with a prevalence of 0.3 -5.1%. These numbers are estimated to be higher in children 0 -4 12 years old.2 While most initial food reactions occur at home, accidental food allergy exposure is 13 more likely outside the home. A significant amount of anaphylaxis fatalities occur while 14 consuming food outside the home when individuals do not have an autoinj ector at the time of 15 reaction.3 Early administration of epinephrine for the treatment of food -induced anaphylaxis is 16 associated with lower risk of hospitalization.4 17 18 Standard first aid kits required by the U.S Department of Labor and Occupational Safety a nd 19 Health Standards do not include any medications.5 Training of food service employees varies by 20 state and by establishment, with varying degrees of training programs. Formal training programs 21 and permit requirements vary, but include food handling safety , allergens, hand washing and 22 hygiene, and incorporate food -borne illness vectors, but do not require CPR training or other 23 first aid.6 24 25 An alternative and additional treatment for food allergy is administration of antihistamines. 26 Antihistamines have a lo nger onset of action and are not effective at reducing the most life - 27 threatening symptoms of anaphylaxis.1 28 29 The auto -injector is a premeasured dose of epinephrine and is intended to be portable and 30 available to use as needed. Alternatives to the auto -injector include drawn -up dosing of 31 epinephrine. Studies7 have shown some differences in use between auto -injectors and drawn - 32 up doses, indicating more room for error with drawing up the dose. Epinephrine drawn up with a 33 syringe has higher risk for incorrect d osing and accidental intravenous administration.7 Studies8 34 have also proposed another alternative, using pre -measured epinephrine dose syringes, but 35 absence of the autoinjector and needle safety remain a concern. 36 37 Several studies9 show there is poor under standing for indications and use of epinephrine among 38 many actors involved in treating anaphylaxis, even in families of children with food allergies, 39 school nurses, and emergency responders. Even with epinephrine available, some evidence10 40 indicates a disc repancy in prehospital treatment of anaphylaxis in pediatric patients, with 41 emergency medical services failing to use epinephrine when indicated. Another study9 of 42 children presenting to the emergency department for anaphylaxis found that less than half of the 43 patients received epinephrine before presentation to the hospital for care. Of the patients in the 44 study, 65% had experienced previous anaphylactic reaction and two -thirds had auto -injectors 1 available at the time of symptom onset.9 In families of chil dren with food induced anaphylaxis, 2 56% of parents expressed fear regarding using the auto -injectors, with the main reasons being 3 fear of hurting the child, using the auto -injector incorrectly, or bad outcomes.11 4 5 With higher prevalence of anaphylaxis in children, most states have legislation allowing schools 6 to stock epinephrine, and nine states require stocking. Despite legislation, EpiPen4Schools 7 program surveys from 50 states indicate low rates of programs to stock epinephrine and few 8 staff trained in recognizing and treating anaphylaxis.12 In one study13 evaluating the cost to 9 supply auto -injectors in Michigan schools, it was found that few public school patients received 10 epinephrine for anaphylaxis, and the majority of cases occurred in close proximi ty to rapid 11 emergency services response, and around of cases students supplied their own medication. 12 The estimated unsubsidized cost to stock epinephrine auto -injectors in Michigan public schools 13 ranged from $565,460 to 4,846,800 annually, without estima tion of training costs.12 14 15 One pilot program in Ontario placed readily accessible auto -injectors and properly trained staff 16 through a Stock Epinephrine Program, and had one \"critical incident\" in a two year time span. 17 The program was started by a city coun cil vote to place autoinjectors in the local food court and 18 expanded to 81 locations in the city, including restaurants, recreation centers, and the sports 19 arenas. In addition, 700 staff were trained to respond to an anaphylactic reaction. The estimated 20 program cost was $82,000, including staff training. Up -scaling of this program would require 21 restaurant participation, staff training and funding for the actual injectors.14 Of note in this study, 22 participants reported feeling more comfortable dining out if stock epinephrine was available at 23 food establishments and if staff were trained to recognize anaphylaxis symptoms. Many 24 individuals in the study continued to carry their own auto -injectors even if stock auto -injectors 25 were available, which supports the r ecommendation that stocking epinephrine auto injectors is 26 meant to complement, not replace an individual's ability to self -manage.14 Future stocking of 27 auto-injectors in restaurants may include voluntary adoption by food service versus legislative 28 action w ith different degrees of government or private support.3 29 30 Risks associated with public or employee access to auto -injectors without proper training 31 include misdiagnosis of anaphylaxis leading to administration of epinephrine when not indicated, 32 and uninte ntional auto -injector injuries. Accidental injury varies by manufacturer, but use of 33 auto-injectors in general carries a risk if individuals are not trained or prepared to use them in an 34 emergency situation. The most common unintentional injury is injectio n into digits.15 35 36 Previous AMA policy includes 120.008MSS entitled, \"Decreasing Epinephrine Auto -Injector 37 Accidents and Misuse\". This policy highlights the importance of discussing how to properly use 38 auto-injectors with patients as well as improvement of product design and labeling. However, 39 there is no previous AMA MSS policy regarding the stocking of auto -injectors in restaurants.16 40 41 Based on a systematic review17 of 23 studies involving patients and parents administering 42 epinephrine through auto -injecto rs, 37% of patients and 32% of parents and caregivers 43 demonstrated correct administration technique before training. For studies which employed a 44 before -and-after training study design, correct technique was achieved in 77% of patients and 1 79% of caregiver s. 2 3 This highlights the importance of training non -healthcare professionals to correctly administer 4 epinephrine through auto -injectors as there was significant improvement after training sessions. 5 However, the implementation of training programs for employ ees of restaurants across the 6 country is a complicated task and imposes fiscal and educational challenges. It may be more 7 practical for restaurants to voluntarily choose if they want to stock auto -injectors as well as 8 adopt a training program, rather than mandate this through legislation. 9 10 DISCUSSION 11 12 Although it has been shown that training programs are effective in helping non -healthcare 13 professionals successfully administer epinephrine through auto -injectors, implementing these 14 programs is a large undert aking. Additionally, requiring food service establishments to stock 15 epinephrine auto injectors, and keeping staff trained on proper use of the drug raises concerns 16 and could pose risk to all parties involved, even when the intention is to help those in nee d. 17 However, a significant number of anaphylaxis fatalities occur while consuming food outside the 18 home and early administration of epinephrine before reaching the hospital can save lives. When 19 weighing the fiscal and educational challenges of this undertak ing, having quick access to 20 epinephrine is not an insignificant benefit and may outweigh the negative impacts of 21 implementing this policy. Moving forward with this policy change would further expand 22 accessible, life -saving interventions in public spaces. 23 24 This would take a lot of effort and even people who are trained to use auto -injectors are afraid to 25 do so in an anaphylactic emergency. Training employees to recognize signs of anaphylaxis will 26 improve diagnosis and potentially decrease time delays in rece iving epinephrine or other 27 intervention. This policy would only be applicable in states, counties, or establishments where 28 there is already food handler permits. Implementing more widespread use and requirements for 29 food handler permits would be a first st ep toward having employees trained on anaphylaxis and 30 could include expansion to the use of epinephrine for food induced anaphylaxis. Requiring food 31 service establishments to stock and train for use of epinephrine is a commitment that requires 32 more study. 33 34 While this is a gap in existing AMA policy, the current policy is inclusive and reasonable for 35 helping individuals with known food allergies avoid anaphylaxis in the restaurant setting. The 36 proposed change in policy seeks to include another major step in m anagement of food -induced 37 anaphylaxis outside the home. There is evidence that a majority of anaphylaxis is food induced, 38 a fair amount can happen without prior knowledge of allergy, and events are more likely outside 39 the home. 40 41 CONCLUSION 42 43 This resolutio n is well intended and based on evidence displaying a real need in community 1 health, and is on a frontier of life -saving interventions that can be carried out by trained lay - 2 persons. It is an important topic of conversation to have and keep in mind for the future. With 3 current use and cost of autoinjectors among those who are trained to do so, including parents, 4 emergency medical services, and individuals, expanding training and use of epinephrine to a 5 larger scale does not seem to be the solution at this p oint in time. 6 7 RECOMMENDATION S 8 9 There is not enough existing research to justify policy changes to support mandatory stocking of 10 auto-injectors in first aid kits and training of employees at food services establishments on the 11 national scale. With the mod erate fiscal note and unknown effect or cost of implementing the 12 policy, this resolution should be kept in mind as it is on the frontier of first aid along with Stop 13 The Bleed programs, but it is too early to say what impact it will have moving forward. 14 15 Your Committee on Global and Public Health recommends that Resolution 33 be not adopted 16 . 17 Your Committee on Global and Public Health recognizes this research and recommends that the 18 remainder of this report is filed: 19 20 References: 1.

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY & COMMITTEE ON ECONOMICS AND QUALITY IN MEDICINE MSS CHIT AND CEQM REPORT A A-19 Subject : Pharmaceutical Advertising in Electronic Health Record Systems Presented by: MSS Committee on Health Information Technology & MSS Committee on Economics and Quality in Medicine Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 Annual meeting, the AMA -MSS referred for study MSS Resolution 6 - 3 \"Pharmaceutical Advertising in Electronic Health Record Systems\" which states the following: 4 5 RESOLVED, That our AMA oppose the presence of pharmaceutical advertising 6 including, but not limited to, digital banner placement, instant messaging, and 7 pop-up ads within the electronic health record (EHR) to influence or attempt to 8 influence, through economic incentives or otherwise, the prescribing decision of 9 a prescribing practitione r at the point of care; and be it further 10 11 RESOLVED, That our AMA support legislation banning pharmaceutical 12 advertising in electronic health record (EHR) systems. 13 14 Accordingly, the MSS Governing Council assigned this task to the Committee on Health 15 Inform ation Technology (CHIT) and the Committee on Economics and Quality in Medicine 16 (CEQM). Your CHIT and CEQM (referred to herein as \"the authors\") studied the current state of 17 pharmaceutical advertising in EHR systems and the revenue models that currently exi st for 18 pharmaceutical advertising in EHRs. We examined the existing regulations governing 19 pharmaceutical advertising, and determined how these regulations applied to direct -to-physician 20 advertising within EHRs. We then looked at current AMA policy on pharm aceutical advertising, 21 in an effort to determine whether direct to physician advertising at the point of care differs from 22 general advertising to physicians. Finally, we looked at existing data on the effects of direct -to- 23 physician advertising at the point of care on physician decision making, quality, and cost of care 24 to determine if additional policy is needed on direct -to-physician advertising at the point of care 25 in EHRs. 26 27 In this report, we start by providing background information on the types and pre valence of 28 direct -to-physician advertisements in different practice settings and EHR systems for the benefit 29 of the assembly. We discuss economic perspectives as they related to both big and small 30 Table of Contents Next Previouspractices, including models that allowed free physician EHR use by offsetting EHR system costs 1 by the revenue generated by in system advertising. We then provide a detailed analysis of 2 current AMA policy and existing regulations, and extrapolate how these may apply to direct -to- 3 physician advertising in EHRs. Final ly, after summarizing existing data on the effects of direct - 4 to-physician advertising on quality of care and patient safety, we provide recommendations to 5 the assembly to address the issue at hand. 6 7 BACKGROUND 8 9 1. Current State of Pharmaceutical Advertising in EHRs 10 11 In certain electronic health records (EHR) systems, there exist subtle yet noticeable 12 advertisements for pharmaceutical drugs. Just beneath detailed patient health information used 13 by physicians for the diagnosis and management of health conditions may be a distinct 14 advertisement for a drug used to treat the ailment the patient is seeking care for. 15 Pharmaceutical advertising in EHRs generally appears in the administrative, consultation, or 16 prescribing interface of EHR software as text -base d advertisements or banners, which are 17 imaged -based advertisements1. Advertisements within EHRs can include various types of 18 information, such as treatment suggestions, recommendations for drug initiation and titration 19 protocols, common side effects of med ications, formulary coverage information, pictures of 20 devices, and clinical trial -based evidence of a drug's efficacy. Moreover, advertisements can be 21 targeted based on physician specialty, target list, geography, past prescribing behavior, patient 22 demogra phic, current therapy, or patient diagnosis based on ICD -10 codes2. 23 24 There are a variety of potential drawbacks that arise from the current infrastructure of 25 pharmaceutical advertising in EHRs. This infrastructure raises the obvious concern of whether 26 adve rtising viewed by a physician within an EHR either consciously or unconsciously influences 27 the physician's treatment3. If there is found to be a significant bias towards prescribing drugs 28 that are heavily advertised, then patients may not receive optimal c are due to under -prescribing 29 of a less heavily advertised drug with better efficacy or lower cost. Advertisements may also 30 lead to overprescribing, due to a potential bias towards prescribing when there is an 31 advertisement on the patient's health record3. On the other hand, there are potential economic 32 consequences of limiting pharmaceutical advertisements in electronic health records. The 33 appeal of pharmaceutical advertising in EHRs is that revenue generated from advertising may 34 offset physician cost of to EHR access, thereby allowing smaller practices access to EHR 35 systems where it otherwise may be cost prohibitive. Thus, the ethical questions pertaining to 36 patient beneficence and nonmaleficence are forefront of the discussion of pharmaceutical 37 advertiseme nts in EHRs. 38 39 2. Existing Revenue Models for Advertising in EHRs 40 41 A variety of revenue models exist for EHR systems, many of which do not rely on advertising for 42 revenue. For example, companies like Hello Health use a \"Pay to Play model\" in which the cost 43 of the EHR is rolled over to patients, while Epic charges hospitals upfront fees for its software 44 and ongoing upgrade, maintenance, and service fees. Moreover, other companies offer a free 1 basic EHR system and offer upgrades related to practice management, sc heduling, billing, and 2 patient portals for a cost. Other models include \"pay for play\" model - where the EHR services 3 are first offered for free4,5, with subsequent charges requested for additional services once the 4 physician and staff are already accusto med to the system, the \"data selling\" model - where 5 there is the possibility of selling medical data to third parties in order to keep the physician from 6 paying fees2, and the \"boutique services\" model - which allows patients who pay an extra fee for 7 the p hysician's EHR system access to perks such as virtual visits and online scheduling2. 8 9 Certain EHR systems have relied on pharmaceutical advertising for revenue, the most notable 10 of which was Practice Fusion. Practice Fusion was an electronic health reco rd company that 11 previously offered free EHR software in exchange for pharmaceutical sponsored advertising6. 12 The company generated revenue from such advertising as well as fees for a premium version of 13 its software. Before Practice Fusion was acquired by Al lscripts in 2015, its user base grew to 14 100,000 health care providers, many of whom were small practice owners in fields like primary 15 care and dermatology.5 While customers attributed Practice Fusion's popularity to its 16 affordability and accepted advertise ments in exchange for such affordability, media reports of 17 intrusive advertisements brought attention to the largely unregulated pharmaceutical advertising 18 practices in EHRs, especially those related to advertising at the point of care. 19 20 3. Existing Regulatio ns on Pharmaceutical Advertising 21 22 Pharmaceutical advertising can be aimed at patients, which is considered \"direct -to-consumer\" 23 advertising (D TCA), or can be targeted to physicians. DTCA refers to pharmaceutical 24 advertising to patients through television, radio, magazine, internet and other media platforms. 25 DTCA has been criticized for its potential to influence physician prescribing due to patient 26 request, while advocates of DTCA argue that it increases patient involvement in their care and 27 education about their care. DTC A is regulated by the FDA Division of Drug Marketing, 28 advertising, and communications (DDMAC) via the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 29 19387, which gave the FDA authority over drug advertising more generally. 30 31 In 1969, regulations we re passed specifically for pharmaceutical advertising to physicians. The 32 regulations stated that ads may not be false or misleading, must present balanced information 33 of risks and benefits, include facts that are essential to the product's advertised uses, and must 34 present a brief summary that mentions every risk that is present in the product labeling. 35 Changes made in 1985 to these final regulations also determined that the fair balance and brief 36 summary that were required when advertising to healthcare pr oviders were also sufficient for 37 consumers. If companies did not comply with FDA requirements, the DDMAC would issue 38 regulatory warning letters8. However, in 2002, the Secretary of Health and Human Services 39 passed a ruling that required all draft regulator y letters to be reviewed by the FDA's office of 40 chief counsel before they were sent to pharmaceutical companies. This ruling resulted in a 41 decrease of warning letters from 68 in 2001 to only 28 in 2002. In 2009, only 59 full -time 42 employees were responsible for reviewing 71,759 submissions, including those pertaining to 43 DCTA and direct -to-physicians advertising9. In summary, current regulations surrounding both 44 DTCA and direct -to-physician advertising is regulated by the FDA and have similar 1 requirements, ho wever the vast number of advertisements to be reviewed by the DDMAC may 2 exceed what is feasible by the department. 3 4 5 4. Existing AMA Policy on Pharmaceutical Advertising 6 7 This section briefly introduces existing AMA policies the authors have identified as ei ther directly 8 pertinent to pharmaceutical advertising in EHRs or that serve as important guiding framework 9 regarding physician interactions with the pharmaceutical industry. Policies from the AMA House 10 of Delegates (HOD), Directives from the HOD, and opini ons from the Code of Medical Ethics 11 were considered for inclusion. 12 13 Since 1974 the AMA has acknowledged the importance of maintaining a relationship with the 14 U.S. pharmaceutical industry in H -100.995: 15 16 \"Our AMA continues to support the American pharmaceutical manufacturing industry in 17 its efforts to develop and market pharmaceutical products meeting proper standards of 18 safety and efficacy for the benefit of the American people.\" 19 20 It is in the interest of the AMA provider membership and its patie nts to ensure that prescription 21 medications integral to care are appropriately supported. Furthermore, it is important that our 22 AMA ensure appropriate standards of safety are maintained by organizations developing and 23 distributing therapies. Given the comp lexities of delivering modern healthcare, pursuing this 24 interest is non -trivial and often necessarily deferred to different private and public regulatory 25 organizations more appropriate for specific subject matter (e.g. pharmaceutical industry 26 professional societies, the United States Food and Drug Administration). At the junction of care 27 provisioning and decision -making, though, our AMA does provide broad policy. 28 29 Providers have historically been considered separately from consumer s as applied to the 30 devel opment of policies regarding advertising. DTC advertising is addressed under formal policy 31 H-105.988, in which the AMA supports a ban on DTC advertising and lays out guidelines for 32 product claim DTC advertising until such a ban is in place. The AMA Code of Ethics E -9.6.7 lays 33 out physician expectations to remain unbiased given the existence of DTC advertising. On the 34 other hand, direct -to-physician advertising is addressed as ethical opinions on overt marketing 35 practices that could compromise patient -provid er relationships. Current AMA policies governing 36 the physician relationship with pharmaceutical marketing are described below. 37 38 E-9.6.2 establishes core guidelines for physicians receiving \"gifts\" from industry. Cash gifts are 39 explicitly considered uneth ical, as are any gifts with a quid pro quo. Only \"in -kind\" gifts of 40 \"minimal value\" that directly help patients are acceptable. This is presumed to not include 41 pharmaceutical sampling, as that is expressly supported in current AMA policy, and not 42 considere d in the context of marketing to physicians (H -120.991). These existing policies 43 underscore two very critical principles: (1) advertising mechanisms that undermine a physician's 44 ability to provide unbiased care are unethical, while acknowledging that (2) p harmaceutical 1 advertising can benefit patients in proper circumstances. 2 3 Additionally , outside the confines of \"gifts\" is the practice of financial support to enable 4 continuing medical education. The following ethical opinion is delivered in E -9.2.7: 5 6 \"CME that is independent of funding or in -kind support from sources that have nancial 7 interests in physicians' recommendations promotes condence in the independence and 8 integrity of professional education, as does CME in which organizers, teachers, and 9 others involved in educating physicians do not have nancial relationships with industry 10 that could influence their participation. When possible, CME should be provided without 11 such support or the participation of individuals who have nancial interests in the 12 educational subject matter.\" 13 14 The authors consider this opinion to be of critical importance, as it highlights that while 15 pharmaceutical advertising/influence may be appropriate in certain settings, other settings (e.g. 16 educational settings in E -9.2.7) r eserve special status in which similar influence is unacceptable. 17 18 Advertising within EHRs is unique in that advertising can be shown to physicians directly at the 19 point of care, including on the same EHR interface through which physicians prescribe . There is 20 very little existing policy regarding advertising at the point of care, as mechanisms to advertise 21 so acutely to the delivery of care have only recently developed. One parallel for which the AMA 22 has existing policy is regarding the presence of industry representatives in clinical settings. AMA 23 policy E -10.6 recognizes: 24 25 \"However, allowing industry representative to be present in clinical settings while care is 26 being given also raises concerns. Their presence can pose challenges for patient 27 autonomy, pri vacy, and confidentiality as well as safety and professionalism in care - 28 giving.\" 29 30 Though the policy allows industry representatives in clinical settings, the physician must ensure 31 that \"The representative's participation will improve the safety and effecti veness of patient care.\" 32 33 In summary, these policies show that the AMA has adopted a nuanced approach to 34 pharmaceutical advertising. The AMA recognizes that pharmaceutical marketing can unethically 35 influence physicians and endanger the patient/physician i f done inappropriately, but when done 36 appropriately may in fact provide benefit to patients. It outlines that pharmaceutical influence is 37 only acceptable through certain avenues, and that the point of care deserves special 38 consideration. Importantly, these policies underscore that pharmaceutical advertising with the 39 potential to bias physicians (small gifts, medical device representatives) must provide benefit to 40 patient in order to be acceptable. 41 42 DISCUSSION 43 44 In considering pharmaceutical advertising in E HRs, the authors recognize there exist both 1 potential positive and negative impacts of the current system. On one hand, pharmaceutical 2 advertising within EHRs may help physicians learn about new drugs/treatments or may allow 3 EHR revenue models that reduce physician cost associated with EHR use, which may be 4 important to small practices. However, pharmaceutical advertising within EHRs may also either 5 consciously or unconsciously bias the ability of physicians to provide optimal care and/or 6 undermine the phys ician/patient relationship. The authors believe a uniquely concerning 7 element of pharmaceutical advertising within EHRs is its targeting of physicians \"at the point of 8 care,\" during the clinical decision -making process, while a physician is formulating a t reatment 9 plan and writing a prescription. The lack of temporal or spatial separation between the influence 10 of the advertisement and the provision of care may affect prescribing practices and patient in 11 significant ways. Thus, we believe pharmaceutical adve rtising in EHRs is a unique type of 12 advertising that must be scrutinized closely and regulated by its own set of guidelines. 13 14 In accordance with previous AMA policy on advertising, we believe the most important factor to 15 consider is the clinical effect of these types of advertisement on physician prescribing habits and 16 patient outcomes. Thus, we surveyed the literature to find existing data on the effects of 17 pharmaceutical advertising on physician prescribing, patient outcomes, and cost. Unfortunately, 18 we could find no studies that specifically address pharmaceutical advertising within EHRs. 19 Researchers have investigated the effects of general direct -to-physician pharmaceutical 20 advertising. The findings of these studies can be used to speculate on the possib le impact of 21 pharmaceutical advertising within EHRs. A 2013 review by Manchanda and Honka (2013) 22 conclude that detailing (personal advertisement or sales of drugs to physicians by 23 pharmaceutical sales representatives) does change physician prescribing prac tices in the short - 24 term10. However, we do not have enough data to conclude whether these prescribing decisions 25 positively or negatively affect patient health outcomes or how large this effect may be. Surveys 26 suggest that physicians believe pharmaceutical sales representatives over state the 27 effectiveness of their products and that some physicians report using pharmaceutical 28 advertisements as a way to learn educate themselves on new therapies, but again, we remain 29 unsure of the effect of these findings on patient care or how detailin g and other advertising 30 methods compare to advertising within EHRs11. 31 32 Pharmaceutical companies do have a history of profiling physicians based on their patient 33 caseloads, by collecting prescriptions sent by a practice to pharmacies and using this data to 34 tailor advertising efforts accordingly to physicians who are frequent o r infrequent prescribers of 35 certain products. Additionally, the FDA is limited in their oversight of pharmaceutical advertising 36 practices that may unduly affect patient health and may lack sufficient resources to even 37 complete the regulatory activities tha t are contained within their mandate12. Without evidence, 38 we cannot conclude that EHR advertising would significantly impact physician prescribing 39 practices. However, based on the effect of direct -to-physician pharmaceutical advertising in 40 general and the strategies used by pharmaceutical companies to target physicians, we are 41 concerned that EHR advertising may have detrimental effects on prescribing practices. 42 43 With regards to the resolved clauses MSS Resolution 6, we are unable to endorse the resolved 44 clauses as written due to the paucity of existing data on the topic. The first resolved clause asks 45 that \"our AMA oppose the presence of pharmaceutical advertising, including but not limited to 46 digital banner placement, instant messaging, and pop -up ads withi n the electronic health record 47 (EHR) to influence or attempt to influence through economic incentives or otherwise, the 48 prescribing decision of a prescribing practitioner at the point of care.\" The second resolved 49 clause asks that \"our AMA support legislat ion banning pharmaceutical advertising in EHR 50 systems.\" We do not believe there exists strong data to support an outright ban of 51 pharmaceutical advertising in EHRs, and cannot take a clear stance in the absence of evidence 1 that pharmaceutical advertising w ithin EHRs negatively affects patient health outcomes. 2 However, the authors do have concerns about the potential impact of EHR advertising based on 3 studies that have looked at direct -to-physician advertising more generally. We acknowledge that 4 efforts to s tudy this area further would assist the AMA in making more informed policy 5 recommendations in the future, and thus believe it is in our best interest for the AMA to 6 encourage the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to study this issue. We also 7 recogn ize that direct -to-physician advertising in EHRs, much like DTC advertising, puts the onus 8 on physicians to remain unbiased. We believe the development of ethical guidelines for 9 physicians encountering EHR advertising at the point of care, like those that exist in the context 10 of DTC advertising, would be beneficial to physicians. Thus, we additionally suggest that our 11 AMA should study the ethics of direct -to-physician advertising at the point of care, including 12 advertising in EHR systems. 13 14 RECOMMENDATIONS 15 16 In lieu of the A -18 MSS Resolution 6 - \"Pharmaceutical Advertising in Electronic Health Record 17 Systems,\" your CHIT recommends adoption of the following resolved clauses: 18 19 1. RESOLVED, that our AMA encourage the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to 20 study the effects of direct -to-physician advertising at the point of care, including 21 advertising in EHRs, on physician prescribing, patient safety, health care costs, and 22 EHR access for small practices. 23 2. RESOLVED, that our AMA study the ethics of direct -to-physician advertising at the point 24 of care, including advertising in electronic health record systems. 25 26 We recommend that the remainder of this report be filed. 27 REFERENCES 1.

Your CHIT studied the recently changed Federal 12 Communications Commission (FCC) regulations on net neutrality, explored its financial and 13 market competition ramifications, and researched its possible effects on medicine and public 14 health. We examined the ex isting regulations surrounding net neutrality and then looked at 15 current AMA policy that involved removing barriers to access of health information technology 16 (HIT) and minimization of financial burden related to HIT. 17 18 In this report, we start by providin g background information on the history and current legislation 19 surrounding net neutrality, relevant definitions essential to the discussion of net neutrality, and 20 the definition and scope of E -health for the benefit of the assembly. We then provide detail ed 21 analysis on current AMA policy and discuss the ways in which the changes in FCC policy may 22 impact the healthcare industry from various angles. Finally, we present our opinion regarding 23 the handling of online electronic data and provide recommendations t o the assembly on this 24 issue. 25 26 BACKGROUND 27 28 Table of Contents Next Previous Net neutrality is the principle that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) should treat all content on 1 the internet equally, without discriminating based on the content provided. In 2010, the Open 2 Internet Order was passed by the FCC, which revolved around three basic tenets: transparency, 3 no blocking, and no unreasonable discrimination1. The order required that ISPs increase 4 transparency by \"disclosing man agement practices, performance characteristics, and terms and 5 conditions of their broadband services\"1. Blocking is defined as preventing lawful content, 6 applications, services, or non -harmful d evices from being accessible to internet users. For 7 example, in 2007 the nation's second largest internet service provider, Comcast, came under 8 fire for blocking large file -sharing companies such as BitTorrent from sharing their content with 9 their high spe ed customers because these large files required substantial bandwidth which 10 could in turn affect access speeds of other subscribers2. 11 12 In 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband internet se rvices as telecommunication services 13 under Title II of the Communications Act, thereby subjecting services to more stringent 14 regulation including bans on content throttling and paid prioritization. Bandwidth throttling occurs 15 when Internet service provider s (e.g., Comcast) intentionally slow down the speed of a specific 16 internet service (e.g., BitTorrent)3. Alternatively, paid prioritization occurs when ISPs provide 17 faster internet service to com panies who are willing to pay more based off of a tiered system for 18 data delivery speed3. Under the Trump Administration in December of 2017, the FCC voted to 19 reverse its prior decision and subs equently passed the \"Restoring Internet Freedom Initiative\"4, 20 which removed the classification of broadband services as a telecommunication platform in Title 21 II5. On March 8th, 2019, Representative Michael Doyle (D -PA18) introduced the \"Save the 22 Internet Act of 2019\" to the House of Representatives6. If passed, the bill woul d reverse the 23 Restoring Internet Freedom Initiative of 20176. It has since then been referred to and passed 24 through the subcommittee on Communications and Technology, and been forwarded to the 25 House Energy and Commerce Committee as of March 26, 20196. Advocates for the Restoring 26 Internet Freedom Initiative of 2017 argue that the repeal of net neutrality will promote 27 investment and broa dband implementation4. Advocates of the \"Save the Internet Act of 2019\" 28 express concern that the repeal of net neutrality may stifle competition and give ISPs a 29 disproportionate amount of contro l over internet access and its functions3. 30 31 RELEVANT AMA POLICY 32 33 Existing AMA policy generally promotes increasing patient access to electronic health data, 34 encouraging innovation and competitio n amongst technology vendors, and removing barriers to 35 internet -based care. These principles are potentially directly impacted by the repeal of net 36 neutrality and specific policy on net neutrality must remain consistent with these principles . 37 Existing AMA policy on related issues is summarized in Table 1. In short, existing policy 38 supports increasing patient access to healthcare information. This is seen in policy promoting 39 \"the elimination of information blocking\" (H -478.981) and removing \"barriers to inte rnet-based 40 health records\" (D -478.979). Similarly, AMA policy supports the \"expansion of broadband and 41 wireless connectivity to all rural and underserved areas of the United States\" (H -478.980). The 42 repeal of net neutrality could allow companies to place l imits on how, where, and when patients 43 and providers are able to access this healthcare data. 44 1 Furthermore, AMA policy encourages innovation and competition in electronic healthcare. The 2 AMA advocates for innovation in order to \"improve usability and decre ase costs\" of healthcare 3 technology (D -478.976). Similarly, the AMA encourages \"free market competition among all 4 modes of health care delivery\" (H -165.985) and states that \"the needs of patients are best 5 served by free market competition and free choice b y physicians and patients\" (H -285.998). The 6 AMA also supports initiatives to \"minimize financial burden to physician practices adopting and 7 maintaining electronic health records\" (D -478.996). The repeal of net neutrality could allow 8 companies to pursue pol icies that lessen both innovation and competition in healthcare 9 technology or increase the cost of healthcare delivery, thus negatively impacting both providers 10 and patients. 11 12 Policy Pertinent Components Health Information Technology Principles H - 478.981 Promote the elimination of \"Information Blocking.\" Promoting Internet -Based Electronic Health Records and Personal Health Records D - 478.979 \"Educate physicians about the barriers to PHR implementation, h ow to best minimize risks associated with PHR use and implementation\" Increasing Access to Broadband Internet to Reduce Health Disparities H -478.980 \"Advocate for the expansion of broadband and wireless connectivity to all rural and underserved areas of t he United States\" Innovation to Improve Usability and Decrease Costs of Electronic Health Record Systems for Physicians D -478.976 \"Support collaboration between and among proprietary and open -source EHR developers to help drive innovation in the marketplace\" \"Continue to advocate for research and physician education on EHR adoption and design best practices specifically concerning key features that can improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of health care\" Opposition to Nationalized Healthc are H - 165.985 \"Free market competition among all modes of health care delivery and financing\" Information Technology Standards and Costs D-478.996 \"Continue to advocate for and support initiatives that minimize the financial burden to physician practices of adopting and maintaining electronic medical records\" Table 1. Existing AMA Policy pertinent to the effects of net neutrality on healthcare. 13 14 DISCUSSION 15 16 1. Financial Impact 17 18 The United States spent $3.5 trillion on healthcare expenditures in 2017, representing 17.9% of 1 gross domestic product (GDP) and over $10,700 per person7. Moreover, the Centers for 2 Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) project that national health expenditures will conti nue to 3 grow at an average rate of 5.5% per year for 2018 -2027, reaching nearly $6.0 trillion by 20277. 4 The repeal of net neutrality creates the possibility that internet service providers (ISPs) could 5 potentially begin charging an additional fee to transmit healthcare data. If this proves necessary 6 to provide adequate patient care, additional fees at such a scale could add significant costs 7 which may ultimately be passed on to patients, potential ly further crippling the fiscal viability for 8 Medicare and Medicaid. 9 10 2. Reduced Competition 11 12 The AMA, as previously mentioned, supports policies that promote an open and competitive 13 healthcare market and is generally opposed to anti -competitive actions. A no n-neutral internet 14 has the potential to raise the barrier of entry for new firms wishing to operate in the healthcare 15 space and to disrupt the natural process of innovation by placing established, well-funded 16 companies at an inherent advantage over those w hich are smaller or less well funded. 17 18 The ability to utilize the internet as a conduit for information exchange lies at the core of many 19 applications of technology in the healthcare industry . Innovations such as telehealth rely on the 20 internet to rapidl y send and receive data, including videos, images, text, etc. In a non -neutral 21 internet, data would be treated differently based on a number of factors including type, sender, 22 or origin. The potential exists for ISPs to establish \"fast lanes\" which would p rioritize the delivery 23 of specific data over that of others. At their discretion, they would have the authority to sell 24 access to these fast lanes and choose to place certain types of data within them. 25 26 The existence of pay -to-play fast lanes would give an undue advantage to firms that have the 27 means to afford access. Any application with fast lane access would perform more quickly and 28 reliably than those that do not. In this scenario, new companies in the healthcare space would 29 have to either pay the hig her fee or face diminished performance for their products. This would 30 increase the already high barrier to entry for healthcare products or devices. The net effect 31 would be a less appealing, less profitable, and more difficult to disrupt healthcare system. 32 33 For example, ISP owned healthcare companies, such as Verizon Wireless's OnCare, pose an 34 anti-competitive conflict of interest over rival companies8. In a non -neutral internet, there would 35 be no compelling force to stop an ISP from giving preference to traffic related to its own 36 companies or services over that of competing firms. They may charge competitors, including 37 hospitals, utilizing their network a premium for equivalent service or may w aive the cost of data 38 used to access web -based services they provide. While another hospital or company may 39 already pay fees to Verizon for their internet access, they would now also incur additional cost 40 to ensure equivalent quality. Hospitals would eithe r pass this cost onto the customer or, if they 41 are unable to pay, jeopardize the quality of the care or services they provide. 42 43 Taken together, a non -neutral internet threatens to have a dampening effect on innovation 1 within the healthcare space and disru pt market competitiveness. The ability to pay for fast lane 2 access would supplant merit and innovation as the driving force for company survival. 3 Companies with more innovative products but an inability to pay would be disadvantaged 4 compared to those with greater capital resources. ISPs would be granted unyielding power as 5 market drivers and edge out competitors by raising their cost or offering poorer service. 6 Patients, healthcare providers, insurance companies, and taxpayers could face fewer options, 7 lower quality service, and higher costs. On the other hand, with the proper regulations in place, 8 healthcare competition could potentially be preserved in a non -neutral net. Thus , AMA policies 9 on net neutrality must focus on preserving competition. 10 11 3. Potential Effects of Repeal of Net Neutrality on Delivery of Care 12 13 Within the context of internet use and its effects on the delivery of care, there are several 14 important trends to note. First, the provision of healthcare is now more reliant on efficient and 15 operati onal networks as the storage and transfer of digital health data becomes increasingly 16 critical to the care delivery process. Secondly, there is increasing focus on telemedicine as a 17 solution to reduce cost of care, improve quality, and increase access to t he healthcare system. 18 This modality allows for remote monitoring and consultation with patients, but is data intensive, 19 requiring significant bandwidth to support high -quality, accurate, and in -the-moment care. The 20 repeal of net neutrality has many broad i mplications on healthcare that are not limited to a 21 telecommunication company's direct consumers. Discussed here are some possible effects of 22 the 2017 repeal of net neutrality on healthcare access, telemedicine, and rural health. 23 24 The FCC has previously e xpressed support for extending and maintaining internet access for 25 telemedicine services. FCC Chairman Ajit Pai has claimed that, \"By ending the outright ban on 26 paid prioritization, we hope to make it easier for consumers to benefit from services that need 27 prioritization --such as latency -sensitive telemedicine.\"9 In addition, the FCC has several 28 mechanisms in place that specifically promote telemedicine in rural areas, including the Rural 29 Health Care (RHC) Program4,10. One arm of the RHC Program, the Healthcare Connect Fund 30 Program, provides a 65% discount for the installatio n of communications services like DSL, 31 Internet access, or fiber for qualifying rural -servicing healthcare providers. The other arm, the 32 Telecommunications Program, subsidizes the difference between urban and rural telecoms 33 services to eligible rural healt hcare providers. The FCC's Connect2Health Task Force has also 34 collaborated with the National Cancer Institute to improve symptom management for cancer 35 patients in rural and underserved communities (L.A.U.N.C.H. initiative)11. Despite these heavy 36 investments in rural telemedicine and the expansion of telecoms coverage, the FCC has yet to 37 make a statement on how a non -neutral internet would specifically impact telehealth. Currently, 38 there are no gu idelines or rules from the FCC that will ensure the affordability and accessibility 39 of telemedicine. 40 41 In addition to healthcare access, another area that could be impacted by the repeal of net 42 neutrality regulations is mobile health (mHealth). mHealth is the use of mobile devices including 43 fitness applications, wearable monitoring devices, and disease surveillance to supplement 44 traditional healthcare modalities. It is increasingly being used as a tool for preventative 1 healthcare; according to the 2018 con sumer sentiment survey from UnitedHealthCare, 36% of 2 Americans use mobile apps as their first source of information about specific health symptoms, 3 conditions and diseases12. In another study by the WHO's mHealth New Horizons for Health 4 Through Mobile Technologies survey, data shows that Americans are among the highest mobile 5 health adopters, with rates around 50%13. Furthermore, up to 53% of respondents using 6 mHealth report a willingness to share mobile health data with physicians. While the FCC argued 7 in defense of the net neutrality repeal stating that paid prioritization would benefit latency - 8 sensitive telemedicine, it is unclear ho w those effects would be translated towards mHealth 9 technologies. In the WHO survey, 39% and 28% of respondents cited operating cost and 10 infrastructure respectively as primary barriers to mHealth implementation. Paid prioritization has 11 the potential to fur ther drive up cost requirements for mHealth, thus becoming prohibitive for 12 many app developers and users. 13 14 CONCLUSIONS 15 16 In considering recommendations regarding net neutrality, your CHIT believes any policies 17 adopted must support the core principles of a ccessibility of healthcare, cost reduction in 18 healthcare, and preserving competition in the healthcare ecosystem regardless of whether the 19 repeal of net neutrality remains intact. Principally, this can be accomplished by ensuring that 20 essential healthcare data is not transmitted at a slower rate than any other data on that network. 21 In a net neutral world, essential healthcare data remains transmitted at similar rates to other 22 types of data, while in a non -net neutral world, essential healthcare data would be immune from 23 price gouging associated with paid prioritization. Additionally, policies ensuring at minimum 24 preservation of essential healthcare data transmission speeds also allows for special 25 prioritization of healthcare data, which may be warranted in a fashion similar to how emergency 26 vehicles are gi ven special prioritization in high traffic conditions on the road. We acknowledge 27 that the discrimination of essential from non -essential healthcare data may be challenging, and 28 that guidelines would need to be developed to effectively stratify essential f rom non -essential 29 health data. Finally, any policy on net neutrality must preserve competition in the healthcare 30 marketplace. 31 32 RECOMMENDATIONS 33 34 In lieu of the I -18 MSS Resolution 06 - \"Promoting Research into the Effects of Net Neutrality 35 on Public Health\" your CHIT recommends adoption of the following resolved clauses: 36 37 RESOLVED, that our AMA advocate for policies that ensure internet service providers 38 transmit essential healthcare data no slower than any other data on that network. 39 40 RESOLVED, that our AMA collaborate with the appropriate governing bodies to develop 41 guidelines for the classification of essential healthcare data requiring preserved 42 transmission speeds. 43 44 RESOLVED, that our AMA oppose internet data transmission practices that reduce 1 market co mpetition in the health ecosystem. 2 3 We recommend that the remainder of this report be filed. 4 References: 1.

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON MEDICAL EDUCATION AND COMMITTEE OF ECONOMICS AND QUALITY IN MEDICINE MSS CME CEQM Report A A-19 Subject: Tuition Reimbursement for Medical Student Performed Electronic Health Record Documentation as a Part of Evaluation and Management Presented by: MSS Committee on Medical Education and Committee of Economics and Quality in Medicine Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez, Chair) ____________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 MSS Annual Meeting, Resolution 34 asked the AMA to collaborate with 3 stakeholders to study, develop, and implement a system for medi cal school tuition 4 reimbursement for electronic medical record/electronic health record (EMR/EHR) 5 documentation. The AMA -MSS Assembly determined there may be unintended consequences 6 on medical education and referred the resolution for study to the Committe e on Medical 7 Education (CME) and the Committee on Economics and Quality in Medicine (CEQM). 8 9 Your CME and CEQM performed an analysis of current tuition payment options available to 10 medical students, regulation of these payments, consequences to medical ed ucation from the 11 proposed policy change, and feasibility of enacting these changes. This report begins with an 12 overview these topics. It then examines then discussing the potential impacts of the resolved 13 clauses of Resolution 34, A -18. 14 15 BACKGROUND 16 17 1. Current Payment Options 18 19 Current undergraduate medical students have several options available to finance their 20 education. First, some students are fortunate enough to self -finance their education, but for 21 those unable to do so, loans tend to be the first op tion.1 Federally Guaranteed Loans and 22 commercial lenders offer students the loans necessary for tuition payments which can be repaid 23 following graduation.2 24 25 Additional options exist; however, most options require students to commit to certain career 26 paths . For example, the Primary Care Loan Program guarantees low -interest loans with the 27 stipulation that the borrower must practice primary care upon graduation for 10 years or until the 28 loan is repaid.3 Military based scholarships are available to students s uch as the Armed Forces' 29 Table of Contents Next PreviousHealth Professions Scholarship Program, which has the benefit of additional stipends while in 1 school but requires seven years of service following residency, and also the Edward Hebert 2 School of Medicine: a military ran medical sch ool that also is tuition free but still requires service 3 following graduation.4 Additionally, the National Health Service Corps (NHSC) and Public 4 Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) programs are available to students, yet again these options 5 have requirements following graduation.5,6 6 7 Lastly, tuition reimbursement in the form of scholarship is available at the federal, state, and 8 institutional level, though these often are based on merit, student needs, or student 9 demographics and have a certain degree of va riability.1 To conclude, there are several avenues 10 students may use to receive tuition assistance, but there is not a widely available opportunity for 11 students to receive reimbursement through work completed during the undergraduate medical 12 education exper ience. 13 14 2. Regulation of tuition payments 15 16 As it currently stands, little to no formal legislation exists surrounding tuition payments within 17 medical education. The most important rules a student must adhere to are laid out in the terms 18 and agreements of the original loan package, whether from a private or public source of funding. 19 Many students enroll in Federal aid packages to help cover the costs of medical education. If 20 those funds are not enough to cover the cost of a student's tuition, they will need to supplement 21 from personal or third -party private sources. Each loan a student receives has its own unique 22 agreements of how the money is dispersed, how interest is calculated, and when a student 23 needs to pay back the loan. In summary, there is no curren t federal policy that outlines how 24 medical students should pay back tuition loans. 25 26 3. Effects on learning environment 27 28 Electronic medical records (EMR) account for a smaller but vital portion of medical student 29 education during their clinical rotations and clerkships. The utility of an EMR during a given 30 clerkship and rotation varies depending on the preferences of the immediate precepting 31 physician, the policies of the medical school, and the policies of the clinical partner organization. 32 Professional s ocieties such as the American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP) and the 33 American College of Surgeons (ACS) support medical student EMR documentation 34 experiences.7-9 35 36 EMR documentation is incorporated in medical student education, as this is a prerequisit e set of 37 knowledge that students need to understand before entering residency and further clinical 38 practice as an attending physician.7 This benefit is subjective, as licensing exam scores are not 39 influenced positively or negatively by EMR use.10 EMR docum entation by medical students may 40 approach half of the work hours, with no correlation to better quality patient care, detracting from 41 education through decreased clinical exposure, decreasing time -off and potentiating 42 deterioration in physical/mental healt h of medical students if needing to do documentation at 43 home.8 44 1 Producing a learning environment that optimally prepares students for residency and practice is 2 a multidimensional process. Experience with any brand of EMR will suffice to prepare students 3 for documentation requirements in residency and full clinical practice, and is up to individual 4 medical schools to design a competency concerning EMR exposure and degree of mastery.1 5 The medical student notes should be written within the patient's chart, wit h orders entered as 6 appropriate, and include exposure to the typical decision aids that an EMR would present to an 7 attending physician.7 8 9 Students participation in EMR documentation increased the number of questions asked during 10 the patient encounter, incr eased appropriate preventative screening tests ordered, and 11 increased knowledge of drug -drug interactions. In a conversely critical manner, it must also be 12 noted EMR documentation usage by students decreased face -to-face communication by nearly 13 half, and l ead to a slightly increased incidence of adverse communication between student and 14 preceptor.11 From this information it is difficult to determine the overall educational value of EMR 15 documentation. 16 17 Internal medicine, pediatrics, and surgery clerkship fac ulty report feeling a negative impact of 18 EMR use on their learning environments. Clerkship directors currently report that students often 19 copy provider notes, meaning patient notes are not as accurate as they could be, drawing 20 further concern about whether the AAMC competencies on EMR documentation training are 21 met and adhered to by clerkship faculty. Student notes are also frequently used to write resident 22 or attending notes, meaning some clerkship faculty see negative impacts of student 23 documentation on p atient record integrity and accuracy.12 Overall, EMR use already has varying 24 effects on the learning environment without tuition reimbursement for medical student notes 25 considered. 26 27 4. Feasibility 28 29 This proposed resolution faces many challenges in implemen tation and effective regulation 30 across medical schools and hospital systems across the country. Certain medical schools have 31 rules in place during the clinical years on how much time a medical student is allowed to spend 32 on documentation within an EMR. Oth er schools do not even allow EMR access for rotating 33 students, or only allow a limited \"view -only\" access for students.13 This raises the question of 34 who will be regulating and overseeing students to ensure that they are adhering to 35 documentation time rule s if there is a financial incentive for note writing. Additionally, EMR 36 access is often inconsistent within a given school's clerkship options. Access depends on 37 clerkship location and thus any potential financial opportunity may not be spread equitably, e ven 38 within a single institution, never mind across the nation as a whole. 39 40 It is hard to imagine CMS providing extra compensation for a note because a medical student 41 was involved in its documentation. Therefore, any tuition reimbursement will come at the 42 expense of the hospital's overall revenue. As a result, many hospitals, especially those who are 43 separate entities from their affiliated medical schools, may not be inclined to adopt new policies 44 surrounding this proposed resolution. If hospitals changed policies and had a system for 1 reimbursement for students, this may cause those systems to decrease the amount of student 2 notes to retain profits by restricting student access or by other means. 3 4 Combined with the previously mentioned ethical concerns and i mplications on the overall 5 educational experience, implementation of a tuition reimbursement policy for medical student 6 documentation provides additional challenges and feasibility concerns for the resolution. 7 8 DISCUSSION 9 10 Although, the notion that undergr aduate medical education is costly and can create a financial 11 burden is well recognized, it is difficult to accept resolution 34 as an appropriate remediation as 12 the outcome that incentivizing EMR notes may have on student education and performance is 13 unpredictable. EMR use by students has seen both educational benefits and deficits. Increased 14 EMR usage is correlated with increased number of questions asked during the patient 15 encounter, increased appropriate preventative screening tests ordered, and increas ed 16 knowledge of drug -drug interactions. On the other hand, increased EMR documentation has 17 seen decreased face -to-face communication by nearly half, lead to a slightly increased 18 incidence of adverse communication between student and preceptor, and certain specialties 19 have seen them as obstacles in learning rather than assets. 20 21 The opportunity of compensation may distract from the educational experience by further taking 22 away patient interaction and leading to communication errors with preceptors. Additionally, 23 tuition reimbursement for medical student notes cannot be guaranteed to not coerce students to 24 see more patients and write less quality notes, nor can guarantee an increase in quality of care 25 for the patients or the quality of education for medical students. Furthermore, each rotation 26 around the country is sure to utilize E MR to different degrees, possibly swaying a student to 27 participate in electives that offer more opportunity to get paid rather than electives that best help 28 students on specialty decision, desired location, or increased training in a area of interest (such 29 as global health or wilderness medicine). A wholly unacceptable possible result in the authors' 30 opinion. 31 32 Mandating and/or enticing medical student documentation in an EMR for tuition reimbursement 33 has a high potential to undermine select competencies of the AAMC in medical student 34 documentation, substituting revenue for education. Even if the educational value is preserved as 35 much as possible with maximum time/compensation allowed, some intrinsic value is sacrificed 36 when these notes become business opport unities instead of learning opportunities. 37 38 From a feasibility standpoint, this resolution carries concern. Due to variation in individual 39 access due to schools', hospitals', and clinics' policies, implementation nationwide would place 40 the responsibility o f the reimbursement on the preceptor location and it's working relationship 41 with the student's home institution. It should also be noted, it is not possible to gauge all effects 42 of billing medical student notes for tuition reimbursement, as each medical sc hool and their 43 clinical partner organizations will need to negotiate this financial and educational intersection. 44 Furthermore, the collaboration between CMS and multiple organizations would be massive to 1 orchestrate and add to CMS costs to implement such a system causing an indirect cost in 2 addition the proposed direct costs to CMS, furthering CMS' barriers to acting upon the desire of 3 resolution 34. 4 5 To summarize, while the costliness of medical education is a concern of the MSS and overall 6 AMA, we feel th is resolution does not provide a predictable outcome that ensures the 7 maintenance of appropriate medical education in the attempt to address medical school tuition 8 nor does the desired outcomes seem feasible in today's world of increasing medical expenses. 9 10 RECOMMENDATION 11 12 Your Committee on Medical Education and your Committee on Economics and Quality in 13 Medicine recommend the following: 14 15 1. That Resolution 34 not be adopted . 16 2. The remainder of this report be filed. 17 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This report was assembled by the 2018 -19 AMA -MSS Committee on Medical Education (James Docherty, Jarrett Campbell, and Bradley Pfeifer) and the 2018 -2019 AMA -MSS Committee on Economics and Quality in Medicine (Arpan Patel and Max Deng).

The AMA -MSS 7 Assembly supported the spirit of the resolution but noted the concerns of the A -18 Reference 8 Committee and referred the resolution for study to the Committee on Medical Education (CME). 9 10 Your CME researched current policy among relevant stakeholders with regards to accessibility, 11 as well as the relevant parts of the ADA. This report begins with an overview of these policies. It 12 then examines the resolved clauses of Resolution 33 A -18, and discusses feasibility, scope, 13 impact and unintended consequences of the resolution. 14 15 BACKGROUND 16 17 1.Current Policy 18 19 Our AMA and MSS both have extensive policy in regards to diversity and support among 20 medical students and medical staff in regards to disability, as is well laid out in the original 21 resolution. Enhancing diversity, equal access, creating an effective envir onment, enhancing 22 accommodations, support groups, and stigmatization are some of the issues on which the AMA 23 and MSS hold current policy. While AMA has policy to work with LCME on many issues, no 24 comprehensive standards regarding the ADA and technical stan dards for disabilities were 25 outlined in AMA policy. 26 27 2.LCME 28 29 In LCME's current standards, there is not specific language pertaining to medical students with 30 disabilities. The LCME's non -discrimination policy (Standard 3.4) does not mention \"ability\" or 31 Table of Contents Next Previous disability. For accreditation, the LCME requires that learning objectives (Standard 6.1) and 1 standards of achievement (Standard 9.6) must be set by faculty members with \"appropriate 2 knowledge and expertise.\" Thus, all learning objectives and standards of a chievement, are set 3 by individual medical schools. Additionally, the LCME does require technical standards for 4 medical students to be published by each school and to be in \"accordance with legal 5 requirements,\" (Standard 10.5) which includes the Americans w ith Disabilities Act, and any 6 additional statewide legislation.1 7 8 3. COCA 9 10 Unlike the LCME, there is specific language included in COCA's Colleges of Osteopathic 11 Medicine (COM) Continuing Accreditation Standards that applies to students with disability. I n 12 the document, published in July of 2017, Element 1.5a lists the overall non -discrimination policy 13 COM must adhere to, which states that students, administration, faculty, and staff may not be 14 selected based on a number of factors, including disabilities. Further, Standard 5 of COCA's 15 accreditation standards states that the learning environment of medical schools must be \" 16 professional, respectful, nondiscriminatory, and intellectually stimulating.\"2 17 18 These previous standards and elements are reinforced la ter in standard 6 of the document 19 which reviews the structure of curricula. Specifically, faculty of COMs are responsible for 20 ensuring that their program aligns with specific objectives and that students \"participate in 21 required clinical training experienc es and environments.\"2 These environments for learning, as 22 described by standard 5, require non -discrimination. This non -discrimination does not 23 specifically mention \"disability\", however. 24 25 Educational objectives, as outlined in Element 6.2, are determined by the individual COM, and 26 must be defined and accessible to students and faculty. Individual programs may thus have 27 objectives and policies tied to providing support to those with disabilities. 28 29 4. AAMC 30 31 As of 2016, 2.7% of medical students - compared to 7.6% and 11.1% of all students in graduate 32 and undergraduate institutions, respectively - self-reported as having a disability ranging from a 33 physical disability and chronic health concerns to learning and psychological conditions, with the 34 majority (55.2 %) identifying ADHD and learning disabilities. 3 35 36 The report published by the AAMC in March 2018, ''Accessibility, Inclusion, and Action in 37 Medical Education,\" as is referenced in the original A18 resolution, seeks to address a potential 38 gap in current pro cess. They noted \"numerous MD and DO programs do not explicitly refer to 39 reasonable accommodations, many prohibit the use of intermediaries, and some do not have 40 technical standards readily available on their websites.\"3 41 42 The authors suggest considerations to help guide stakeholders in academic medicine as they 43 work to improve the climate for learners with disabilities. Structural considerations to improve 44 the climate for learners with disabilities focus primarily on how to increase meaningful access 45 while fostering a culture that is welcoming and inclusive of learners with disabilities through 1 emphasizing professional development, awareness, and openness. 2 3 5. ACGME 4 5 ACGME has a range of committees which serve the purpose o f setting requirements and 6 developing education initiatives. One such committee is responsible for monitoring the quality 7 and performance of ACGME education programs and serves as the resource for the 8 development of new educational initiatives. Another, Co mmittee on Requirements, manages all 9 of the requirements ACGME lays out. This includes, but is not limited to, recommendations on 10 proposed institutional requirements, recognition requirements, common program requirements, 11 and program requirements in specia lties, subspecialties, sub -subspecialties, and medical or 12 medical -related fields. In regards to the resolution, there are no specific mentions of technical 13 standards.4 There also appears to be a disconnect between standards set by ACGME and the 14 actual expe riences of residents/students - there is not mention of specific accommodations that 15 will be available. 16 17 6. American with Disabilities Act 18 19 The amended ADA of 2008 along with the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design prescribe 20 regulations that must be f ollowed to facilitate the most access for those with disabilities. In 21 general, accommodations and modifications are to be made to \" afford goods, services, facilities, 22 privileges, advantages, or accommodations to individuals with disabilities.\"5 The excepti on to 23 this is if making these modifications would make a fundamental difference in the purpose or 24 application of the aforementioned. Not only do these regulations apply to public institutions, 25 such as our state medical schools, they are also applicable to any institution that receives 26 federal funding. Therefore, private medical schools which accept federal financial aid for their 27 students are also required to abide by the ADA regulations. 28 29 DISCUSSION 30 31 1. Feasibility 32 33 ADA protects a student 's right to ask their institution for accommodations as needed to meet 34 technical requirements. However, it may not be feasible, nor does the ADA require, for every 35 institution to anticipate the needs of potential future students. This anticipation could pot entially 36 be detrimental to other students whose needs were unanticipated and now face financial 37 challenges in meeting technical standards of the program. 38 39 2. Scope/Purview 40 41 Support of colleagues is within scope of the AMA and AMA -MSS. However, determining 42 technical standards are not in the scope of AMA as we are not a research nor accrediting body. 43 LCME currently has policy which requires each institution to create standards which are 44 essential to the practice of medicine. As students and not practicing ph ysicians, this may also 45 be out of the scope of AMA -MSS to suggest essential abilities. 46 1 3. Impact 2 3 As standards from ADA are already required to be implemented at any public or private 4 institution which receive federal funding, as well as other regulation s enforced by federal and 5 state laws, there is not sufficient reason to adopt additional standards . Doing so would also 6 create repetition of current AMA and AMA -MSS policies. 7 8 4. Unintended Consequences 9 10 Adopting the resolves with the submitted language co uld have unintended consequence. As 11 publications are susceptible to updates by the original authors or organization, future versions 12 of AAMC's recommended technical standards could potentially be in direct conflict with our 13 AMA and AMA -MSS policies. Additionally, changes to resources and technology could alter 14 what is considered a truly essential ability rendering anything more specific short sighted. 15 16 CONCLUSIONS 17 18 While we agree with the spirit of the resolution and applaud the authors for a thoroug h search of 19 AMA policy to address an important issue, we do not feel our AMA -MSS should bring this 20 forward to our AMA. As discussed above, supporting these changes in LCME and COCA would 21 not effectively lead to change in current practices. As the AMA -MSS, we should bring forth more 22 actionable items to our AMA House of Delegates. 23 24 RECOMMENDATION 25 26 Your AMA -MSS Committee on Medical Education recommends the following: 27 28 1. Amend A -18's Resolution 33, Resolved 1 as follows: 29 30 RESOLVED, That our AMA supports amen ding Liaison Committee on Medical 31 Education (LCME) and the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA) 32 accreditation requirements to require urge all medical schools update their technical 33 standards for the admission, retention, and graduation o f medical students to reflect the 34 requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2008 and other 35 Federal disability non -discrimination laws, and publish them on public websites to make 36 the process for appealing ADA determinations rela ted to meeting technical standards for 37 accommodations more transparent and easily accessible. 38 39 2. Adopt A -18's Resolution 33, Resolved 1 as amended: 40 41 RESOLVED, That our AMA supports changes to LCME and COCA accreditation 42 requirements to urge all medical s chool to make processes for ADA appeals for 43 accommodations to meet technical standards more transparent and easily accessible. 44 45 3. Not adopt A -18's Resolution 33 Resolved 2. 46 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This report was assembled by the 2018 -19 AMA -MSS Committee on Medical Education (Stephanie Strohbeen, Ashleigh Bull, Rachel Drummey, Nick Haberli, and Kirtan Patel) REFERENCES 1.

REPORT OF MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION & ADVOCACY MSS COLA Report A A-19 Subject : Support for Housing Modification Policies Presented by : MSS Committee on Legislation and Advocacy Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) ____________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 MSS Interim meeting, MSS Resolution 8 asked the AMA to support legislation and 3 other efforts to promote housing modifications as a means of falls prevention and improved 4 disability access. The I -18 Reference Committee recommended that MSS Resol ution 08 not be 5 adopted and amended 1) to include a broader range of solutions 2) the AMA and AMA -MSS is 6 not an expert on housing modifications 3) this is covered in AMA policy but not by the AMA - 7 MSS making it a candidate for internal adoption. The I -18 as sembly found the amendments 8 made by the reference committee were too broad and unactionable and referred the report to 9 study. 10 11 Staff experts expressed the following in regard to Resolution 08 -I-18: 12 13 The goal of this resolution is laudable and adopting the 2nd and 3rd resolves would be 14 considered a good addition to our policy compendium. R2 and R3 are widely supported 15 by existing policy outlined in Geriatric Medicine H -295.981, Healthcare for Older Patients 16 H-25.999, and Clinical Preventive Services H -425.9 84. At this time, R1 should not be 17 adopted as there is no evidence...\" 18 19 MSS Resolution 8 has since been referred to the AMA -MSS Committee on Legislation & 20 Advocacy (COLA) for report to be completed prior to the AMA -MSS A -19 meeting. The 21 amended resolved stat ement was as follows: 22 23 RESOLVED, That our AMA -MSS support legislation and other efforts to 24 promote housing modifications as a means of falls prevention and 25 improved disability access, which may include but are not limited to 26 a) health insurance coverage of housing modification benefits 27 b) tax credits and other financial incentives to increase the affordability of home 28 modifications 29 Table of Contents Next Previousc) other federally or state funded programs that provide home modification 1 benefits. 2 3 BACKGROUND 4 5 In the United States (US) home injuries cause more than 30,000 deaths and 12 million nonfatal 6 injuries each year with an estimated cost of $222 billion1. For US adults ages 65 and older in 7 2012, there were 24,190 deaths and 3.2 million nonfatal fall -related injuries2. Direct m edical 8 costs increased from 2012 -2015 from $616.5 to $637.5 million for fatal injuries and $30.3 to 9 $31.3 billion for nonfatal injuries related to falls for adults >65 years of age2. Total Medicare 10 expenditures from 2007 -09 were 13 billion (95% CI, $9 -18 billion) with out of pocket costs per 11 beneficiary at $1,363 (95% CI, $889 -1,837)3. A study estimated that 85% of ED admissions for 12 fall-related injuries was paid by Medicare at a lifetime cost of ED related visits at $40 billion 13 dollars4. For trauma admissi ons, falls accounted for 40.03% of cases and with 49.33% of falls in 14 patients >65 years of age5. In 2017, 87% of the $299 billion spent on Medicare Part A was 15 covered by payroll taxes, this deficit is a corollary to the degree that Medicare is underfunded6. 16 Reducing falls may improve Medicare's ability to maintain solvency. 17 18 US citizens with low socioeconomic status or greater neighborhood disadvantage had a higher 19 rate of falls7. Minorities, those with lower levels of education, and those with less social support 20 were less likely to have home modifications8. However, blacks were less likely than whites (30 - 21 40%) to have fall -related injuries even when controlling for these differences9. These factors 22 may help target strategies to optimally reduce falls and decrease morbidity, mortality, and direct 23 and indirect costs to the healthcare system. Home modifications led by an occupational 24 therapist had the greatest potential to affect the most elderly when compared to six other fall 25 prevention strategies including Tai Chi, Otago, medication management, vitamin D 26 supplementation, expedited first eye cataract surgery, and single -vision distance lenses for 27 outdoor activities10. Housing modifications are effective in reducing falls and a cost savings to 28 the healthcare system11-17. 29 30 Homes are the most likely setting of falls in the elderly with high morbidity and mortality and 31 prevention in the single most effective intervention5,18,19. Home hazards to the elderly include 32 physical limitations, loose rugs, unstable furni ture, obstructed walkways, and poor lighting give 33 way to falls within the home20. Simple modifications aimed at increasing lighting and tacking 34 down loose rugs or carpets have shown to statistically reduce the risk of falling the home16. 35 Other interventio ns include grab bars and grips in the bathroom, hand -rails on both sides of 36 steps, and lever -style handles on doors and faucets, wheelchair ramps, stair lifts, first -floor 37 bathroom or kitchen renovations, and other more extensive renovations21. In order to fund 38 renovations for the at -risk population at an average cost of $2,400 dollars Joint Center for 39 Housing Studies of Harvard University estimated a figure of $13.2 billion in 2014 to cover 5.5 40 million homes21. 41 42 Currently there are three insurance -based fu nding schemes for housing modifications. 43 44 1) In 2018, there was proposed increase in funding for Medicare Advantage, a Medicare 1 Part C capitated insurance plan, to cover additional services as it relates to home based 2 care22,23. This would combine the direct costs of prevention and hospital care into the 3 same funding and expenditure pool per patient and thus the benefits would be directly 4 measurable. 5 2) 43 states and the District of Columbia have used the Medicaid \"Money Follows the 6 Person\" initiative for the el derly, disabled, and other eligible populations to pay for 7 housing modifications24. 8 3) The Veteran's Health Administration established the Home Improvements and Structural 9 Alterations (HISA) benefits in 1973 with a current non -service related injury lifetime grant 10 cap of $6,800 for home modifications25. 11 12 DISCUSSION 13 14 Falls in the elderly cost 30,000 lives and nearly $32 billion dollars every year. Housing 15 modifications are comparatively clinically effective, cost effective, and actionable in preventing 16 fall re lated injuries amongst the elderly. Home modifications are best designed and delivered by 17 an occupational therapist and were effective in a recent systematic review17.This problem is 18 expected to grow significantly by 2030 with an estimated a figure of $13. 2 billion to cover 5.5 19 million homes according the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University Report in 20 201421. 21 22 The current issue is defining the role of the AMA and AMA -MSS in supporting this prevention 23 initiative to decrease patient mortalit y and morbidity. There are several decades of research and 24 initiatives in prevention, cost measurement, and payment mechanisms including insurance, 25 state tax credits and federal tax credits23-27. Given the increased emphasis on Medicare 26 Advantage Plans to cover this service in 2018 and the historical precedence of Medicaid and VA 27 health programs for the disabled, insurance -based schemes of funding are feasible. In addition, 28 the most effective home modifications require a health professional's input. 29 30 It is within the scope of practice of the AMA and AMA -MSS to support housing modifications 31 due to its: 32 1) Public health concern with high mortality and morbidity of falls 33 2) Housing modifications are best implemented by occupational therapists 34 3) Housing modifications ha ve coverage through health insurance mechanisms 35 36 RECOMMENDATIONS 37 38 Your Committee on Legislation and Advocacy recommends that the following recommendation 39 be adopted and the remainder of this report is filed: 40 41 1) The AMA support legislation for health insurance coverage of housing modification 42 benefits for: 43 a. The elderly 44 b. Other populations that require this in order to mitigate preventable health 1 conditions including but not limited to the disabled, soon to be disabled, and 2 other person(s) with physical an d/or mental disability 3 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS References: 1.

REPORT OF MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION & ADVOCACY MSS COLA Report B A-19 Subject : Mandatory Reporting of Sexual Misconduct Allegations to Law Enforcement Presented by : MSS Committee on Legislation and Advocacy Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) ____________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 Interim meeting, Resolution 4 asked the AMA -MSS to support the requirement of all 3 state medical boards to report sexual misconduct allegations by physicians to the appropriate 4 law enforcement agencies. The I -18 Reference Committee recommended the resolution be 5 referred to report due to: 1) unclear wording of the resol ution that could allow for unintended 6 consequences 2) feasibility and scope. Staff experts did not have comment on this resolution. 7 8 The MSS Governing Council asked the 2019 -18 MSS Committee on Legislation & Advocacy 9 (COLA) to report on this issue for the A19 meeting. 10 11 BACKGROUND 12 13 In 1991, the American Medical Association's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs reviewed the 14 ethical implications of patient -physician sexual and romantic relationships with the following 15 conclusions: 1) sexual and romantic co ntact is unethical with a current patient; 2) the same with 16 former patients may be unethical; 3) education on this issue should be made standard in 17 training; 4) reporting colleagues is important1. From 1981 to 1996, 761 physicians were 18 disciplined for sex related offenses with 147 in 19962. From 1995 to 1997, 375 physicians were 19 disciplined in the state of California with 10% of those for inappropriate contact with patients3. 20 From 1991 to 1995 in Oregon, 5.9% of 100 complaints brought against physicians wer e related 21 to sexual misconduct4. 22 23 In Georgia, a recent investigation by the Atlanta -Journal Constitution found that of physicians 24 disciplined for sexual misconduct were permitted to practice again5. From 1981 to 1996, 25 nationally, Dehlendorf et al found t hat of 216 of 761 (39.9%) of physicians disciplined for sexual 26 offenses were licensed to practice2. From 2003 to 2013, nationally, 1039 physicians had sexual 27 misconduct claims with only 29.3% having revocations in clinical privileges or 70.7% still in 28 practice6. An analysis of 101 cases found the following associated characteristics for offenders: 29 Table of Contents Next Previousmale physicians, > 39 years of age, not board certified, non -academic practice, and examining 1 patients alone7. Recently, there have been critiques that sexual mis conduct is not reported and 2 is unpunished by medical boards8,9. An Alabama regulator cited the severe physician shortage 3 as a reason why physicians did not receive severe punishment for proven allegations of sexual 4 misconduct9. Although the case of Dr. Lar ry Nassar received national attention, a recent media 5 report has shown the degree to which this issue has been underreported. Nassar's case is 6 important, but it underestimates and misidentifies perpet rators with relation to geography, 7 specialty, gender, ra ce, religion, and training environment. Recent cases include: Dr. William 8 Almon, Georgia; Dr. Ashok Alur, Kentucky; Psychiatrist, California; Physician, Physician, North Carolina; Dr. Jacob Ward, Georgia; and Dr. 11 Frederick Field, Oregon9. 12 13 Consequences of sexual assault and/or abuse by physicians include depression, anger, drug 14 and/or alcohol abuse, trust issues, and post -traumatic symptoms.7 The issues reported by 15 victims of physician sexual abuse mirror those reported by survivors of other types of sexual 16 violence or assault10. 17 18 Mandated reporting of victims of sexual abuse varies by the victim and perpet rator. Typically, 19 health care providers are responsible for reporting crimes related to sexual abuse to authorities. 20 All states require reporting of crimes against children or minors11. Most states have laws for 21 reporting abuse and sexual assault of depend ent adults11. There are variable laws requiring 22 reporting of sexual assault of competent adults by a caregiver or authority figure11. However, 23 there are limited laws for mandated reporting of crimes of sexual assault of competent 24 adults11,12. 25 26 DISCUSSION 27 28 In order to preserve the integrity of the physician -patient relationship, Resolution 43 proposes a 29 solution that will increase cooperation with law enforcement, increasing the transparency of the 30 disciplinary process. Previously, the AMA CEJA attempted to preempt inappropriate 31 relationships with patients due to power differential and determined that personal relationships 32 were unethical by three classifications and making reporting compulsory by colleagues. Over 33 time, according to literature, the rate of a ccusations against physicians has increased while the 34 consequences for physicians has decreased2,6. It is unclear why this trend has emerged, but it is 35 a failure of the system if the trend is moving in the wrong direction. 36 37 An important consideration is th e legal requirements for any mandated reporting of sexual 38 assault claims. As part of the literature, a comprehensive media expos\u00e9 highlighted the lack of 39 oversight and reporting for physician initiated sexual assaults. However, the laws on mandatory 40 report ing apply to all perpetrators regardless of status with respect to a competent victim. Thus, 41 in order to remedy the issue of mandatory reporting, the legal requirements must be put under 42 further scrutiny. The possibility of false claims arising from increa sing reporting requirements 43 has already been addressed by requiring chaperones for sensitive patient examinations. 44 1 This issue was addressed by Resolution 243 at the A -18 national conference presented by the 2 state of Michigan: 3 4 RESOLVED, That our American Medical Association work with the Federation of State 5 Medical Boards to create and encourage state adoption of \"model public health code 6 language\" that would require all state medical boards to report criminal sexual conduct 7 or predatory sexual behavior to appropriate law enforcement authorities. (Directive to 8 Take Action) 9 10 Subsequently, a report by the Reference Committee on this resolution recommended adoption 11 of a substitute resolution H -515.954 Addressing Barriers to Reporting Health Care Provider Sex 12 Crimes which states that : 13 14 \"Our AMA will support the efforts and work with the Federation of State Medical Boards 15 to examine disciplinary data, barriers that delay or prevent reporting of sex crimes, and 16 the cooperation of state medical boards with law enfo rcement in order to ensure a 17 comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing sexual crimes within medicine.\" 18 19 However, this solves the important issue of licensing, credentialing and practice - but not the 20 issue of reporting . Reporting is not occur ring at sites of care because it is not compulsory and 21 consolidation of information by the Federation of State Medical Boards (FSMB) would not 22 address the issue with poor reporting due to a lack of legal requirements in all but 11 states. H - 23 515.954 is an imp ortant resolution but it is a separate issue that does not directly provide a 24 solution to a key component of this problem that deserves unique resources and focus . Given 25 the vast scope of practice related to licensing and credentialing, the Federation of S tate Medical 26 Boards may not be the most appropriate body to address issues relating to drafting mandatory 27 reporting laws for sexual misconduct claims. 28 29 In addition, with recent reporting in Alabama that identified a regulator willing to overlook these 30 claims and misconduct due to a lack of medical providers it is even more important that we 31 place the risk of legal action on those not reporting these claims. It is paramount that above all 32 else, the safety of patients and the integrity of the patient -physici an relationship is preserved. 33 Thus, it is our belief that this requires consideration by a body of legal and policy experts with a 34 more defined scope of practice. It may be important to re -consider the state of Michigan's 35 original proposal with clarificati on of intent based on the legal standard of mandatory reporting 36 with re-examination of current policy initiated by the current medical student authored resolution. 37 38 Prior model legislation that has been able to accomplish parity across states with respect to 39 healthcare has been accomplished by the Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 Public Law 104 -204. 40 This was legislation that codified standard coverage for mental health care at a national level 41 and implemented the law by specifically adapting it for each sta te, amending the appropriate 42 state codes and creating new titles or chapters. The precedent of model parity legislation 43 pursued by the American Psychiatric Association in 1996 with the Mental Health Parity Act 44 under President Bush was later extended with t he Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 1 2010 under President Obama. In 2018, the AMA drafted an amicus brief in response to NIFLA 2 vs. Becerra. Thus, there is precedent in the AMA's scope of practice as it relates to legal 3 positions with regard to patient -physician practice and relationships. 4 5 This regulatory requirement for reporting is under the purview of the AMA and AMA -MSS for the 6 following reasons: 7 1) Mandated reporters of any sexual assault of minors, dependent adults, or competent 8 adults assaul ted by an authority figure include healthcare professionals. 9 2) Perpetrators of such assault may include healthcare professionals. 10 3) This requires a valid and objective process to protect sensitive populations from physical 11 and emotional abuse 12 13 RECOMMENDATION 14 15 Your Medical Student Section Committee on Legislation & Advocacy recommends that the 16 following recommendation is adopted and the remainder of the report is filed : 17 18 Our AMA advocate for universal mandatory reporting of sexual, physical, and emotional 19 assault claims when the alleged perpetrator is any type of health care professional by 20 convening a working group of AMA lawyers to develop uniform and standard language 21 that can be adopted by states using the precedent of model parity legislation. 22 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS References: 1.

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION AND ADVOCACY MSS COLA Report C A-19 Subject : Support for the Standardization of Driving Restriction Laws after Transient Loss of Consciousness Presented by : MSS Committee on Legislation and Advocacy Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) ____________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 Annual Meeting, Resolution 6 asked AMA -MSS to support evidence -based 3 standardization of state driving restriction laws after transient loss of consciousness. While the 4 importance of such a parameter is well -recognized, the AMA -MSS Assembly, after receiving 5 mixed testimony, found that there was no current data to support developing a strong policy 6 position. Even the American Academy of Neurology has not set recommendations for driving 7 restrictions after an episode of loss of consciousness. Therefore, the resolution was referred for 8 study to t he Committee on Legislation and Advocacy (COLA) to review research conducted on 9 this topic, as policy adoption and implementation prior to research by experts in the field is 10 premature. Accordingly, COLA produced this report, which details the various rest rictions that 11 exist across the country, the research conducted on how driving ability is actually impaired post - 12 loss-of-consciousness and within certain timeframes, but, most importantly, how few controlled 13 studies there are and how recommendations vary by patient. 14 15 BACKGROUND 16 17 The medical literature has long treated transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) as a catch -all 18 term for what can be a grab bag of causes and diseases. According to a joint report of the 19 American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, and endorsed by the 20 American College of Emergency Physicians, \"transient loss of consciousness\" (TLOC) is 21 defined as \"a self -limited loss of consciousness that can be divided into syncope and non - 22 syncope conditions. Non -syncope conditio ns include but are not limited to seizures, 23 hypoglycemia, metabolic conditions, drug or alcohol intoxication, and concussion due to head 24 trauma. The underlying mechanism of syncope is presumed to be cerebral hypoperfusion, 25 whereas non -syncope conditions ar e attributed to different mechanisms.\"i As evidenced from 26 the definition, TLOC encompasses a wide range of diseases, disorders, and pathologies all with 27 different expected clinical courses, pathophysiologic sequelae, and prognoses. Often, TLOC is 28 a tempora ry diagnosis meant to serve as a placeholder while a full diagnostic work -up is 29 undertaken to determine the underlying cause of the loss of consciousness. Because of the 30 Table of Contents Next Previousextraordinary range of pathology that could present as TLOC, clinical recommendations and 1 guidelines emphasize identifying the underlying cause as imperative before developing a 2 treatment plan or providing clinical counseling to the patient. 3 4 Every state regulates driver's license eligibility of persons with certain medical conditions. Whi le 5 states often consult with medical experts when drafting legislation, the authority to determine the 6 laws governing public health and safety is firmly within the state's constitutional power. 7 Historically, states have largely developed their own legislat ion governing public health and 8 safety independent of other states. This non -standardized approach often leads to disparate 9 laws governing the same situation in different states, creating confusion for those traveling or 10 moving.ii iii For example, individual state driving laws for people with epilepsy vary greatly, with 11 some states requiring mandatory reporting and others allowing accommodation for specific 12 clinical factors.iv vvi Importantly, epilepsy represents on e discreet cause of TLOC, yet even within 13 this category of diagnosis, states have continued to disagree about the appropriate balance 14 between public safety and individual autonomy. 15 16 DISCUSSION 17 18 TLOC is somewhat of an umbrella term for a variety of diagno ses, some more chronic than 19 others. However, often TLOC is often synonymous with seizure in the literature. As it currently 20 stands, most states either have a mandatory seizure -free interval prior to resumption of driving 21 or individualized assessments on a case -by-case basis. A few states have a hybrid system of 22 these two. That being said, there are no data showing any of these three system prevent 23 automobile accidents. Furthermore, studies show that individuals with epilepsy are more likely 24 to be in serious automobile accidents independent of antiepileptic use. The only measurement 25 found in the literature that decreases automobile accidents after TLOC is seizure -free interval. 26 27 Currently, there are no guidelines, either medical or legal, to inform decision -making on driving 28 after transient loss of consciousness. This lack of evidence -based recommendations poses a 29 challenge for state DMVs regulating driving license after transient loss of consciousness. As 30 such, states systems widely vary in their regulations on driving after TLOC as shown by the 31 three systems mentioned earlier. However, there is no data showing reduced accident rates 32 correlated with specific driving recommendations. 33 34 At this time, there is insufficient evidence to support a standardization of licensure after TLOC 35 events. 36 37 RECOMMENDATION \\ 38 Your Committee on Legislation and Advocacy recommends that the following recommendation 39 be adopted and the remainder of this report is filed: 40 41 1. That our AMA -MSS not adopt a formal position on standardization of state laws 42 governing driving after Transient Loss of Consciousness. 43 References: 1. Circulation. Krumholz A, et al.

Current v REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON LONG RANGE PLANNING AND COMMITTEE ON MEDICAL EDUCATION COLRP CME Report A A-19 Subject : Understanding Philanthropic Efforts to Address the Rise of Medical School Tuition Presented by : MSS Committee on Long Range Planning & MSS Committee on Medical Education Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (, Chair) INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 MSS Interim Meeting, the AMA -MSS passed the MSS Resolution 29 - 3 \"Understanding Philanthropic Efforts to Address Medical Student Tuition\" which states the 4 following: 5 6 RESOLVED, AMA -MSS study the financial sustainability of factors enabling the 7 implementation of tuition -free and tuition -reduced undergraduate medical education 8 programs; and be it fu rther 9 10 RESOLVED, AMA -MSS study the efficacy of using tuition -free and tuition -reduced 11 undergraduate medical education programs to incentivize primary care specialty choice 12 among medical students. 13 14 The original resolution was brought before the I -18 Reference Committee, who received 15 testimony in support of the resolution, and felt that the subject -matter was both important and 16 worthwhile for the MSS to adopt. The MSS Governing Council asked the 2018 -2019 Committee 17 on Long Range Planning (COLRP) and th e 2018 -2019 Committee on Medical Education (CME) 18 to conduct the studies and produce a report for the 2019 MSS Interim Meeting. 19 20 BACKGROUND 21 22 1.Introduction 23 In August of 2018, the New York University School of Medicine (NYU SOM) announced that all 24 current and future medical students would be provided a tuition -free education by means of 25 raising $600 million in donations from trustees, school alumni, and friends of the university.1 In 26 February of 2019, Kaiser Permanente announced that accompanying the openin g of their own 27 medical school in 2020, their school would also waive the tuition for all students matriculating 28 Table of Contents Next Previousbetween the Falls of 2020 to 2024.2 These announcements made a significant impact in the 1 medical community, as the cost of obtaining a medical e ducation reached a median debt of 2 $192,000 in 2018.3 Following the announcement from NYU SOM, numerous discussions began 3 surrounding the feasibility of more schools transitioning to a tuition -free model, notably within 4 the pre -medical and medical student c ommunities. Resolution 29 from the 2018 MSS Interim 5 Meeting provided the first direct request within the AMA -MSS for further studies into other 6 similar tuition models currently implemented in other medical schools. 7 8 2. Existing Large -Scale Tuition Assistance Models 9 10 Several institutions have enacted programs to cover some or all their medical students with 11 partial to full tuition aid. 12 13 School officials have described the aim of these programs being to increase the number of 14 phys icians in medical fields (oft en less lucrative specialties) and geographical regions with 15 anticipated physician shortages. Robert Grossman, dean of NYU SOM, described the challenge 16 of relieving medical student debt burdens as a \"moral imperative.\"1 While donors and schools 17 may agree o n this need, there are differing views on strategies for meeting physician shortages. 18 19 In July of 2018, the University of Houston announced that the inaugural class of 30 students in 20 the Fall of 2020 will have their tuition covered. This effort was funded by a single anonymous 21 donation of $3 million to cover an approximate annual cost of $25,000 per student.4 22 23 In October of 2018, Columbia University announced receipt of a $250 million donation, which 24 was matched up to $500 million with $300 million dedicat ed towards subsidizing tuition. The 25 fund is directed towards students demonstrating the greatest financial need (an estimated 20% 26 of students), with up to 50% of students receiving some form of financial assistance, mostly as 27 scholarships. The school's ult imate aim is for the complete replacement of student loan 28 packages with grants.5 29 30 Beginning in 2008, the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine has covered costs of tuition 31 for approximately 30 students each year who are accepted into a 5 -year progra m that includes 32 one year of dedicated research. During the dedicated research year, students will receive both 33 full tuition coverage and a $23,000 stipend. The program is reportedly funded through Cleveland 34 Clinic endowments and hospital operations.6 35 36 Most notably, the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences has waived tuition for 37 approximately all 170 students per class using taxpayer dollars. In exchange, seven years of 38 service in the Armed Forces is required after graduation. This support a ims to improve care for 39 veterans and their families by augmenting the quantity of healthcare providers in the Armed 40 Forces.7 41 42 Programs with existing endowment infrastructure also have begun to act to address medical 43 student debt. Following NYU's announcem ent, a member of the Mayo Clinic Alix School of 44 Medicine pledged $200 million to the school, with 50% to be used for student scholarships and 1 financial aid. 8 2 3 3. Comparison on the Structure and Funding of Tuition -Free Programs 4 5 The following table includes a comparison of the type of medical programs which offer tuition 6 free or tuition reduced programs. Each program was compared by examining the type of 7 institution (private, public, or federal), whether they offered an allopathic or osteopathic degree, 8 the starting year of the tuition free program, the approximate value of the total tuition per year, 9 the percentage of tuition covered, the receipts of the reduced tuition and the funding source of 10 the program. Your COLRP and CME recognize that this table is a small representative sample, 11 and not indicative of all tuition -free or tuition -reduced programs available. 12 Medical Program Type of Institut ion Tuition - Free Program Start Year Total Tuition % Tuition Covered Recipients Funding Source New York Universit y School of Medicine Private M.D. 2018 $55,000 100%; students still responsi ble for living expense s All current and future students Predominantly donations/endowm ents from trustees, alumni, and friends David Geffen School of Medicine (UCLA) Public M.D. 2002 $40,714 100% (addition ally covers \"the entire cost of educatio n\") Merit based.

Debt Levels and Specialty Choice: 2 3 In 2014, 102 allopathic U.S. MD students across 22 institutions were surveyed and found that 4 students with higher levels of debt were more likely to choose a specialty with a higher average 5 annual income, were less likely to plan to practice in underserved locations and were less likely 6 to choose primary care specialties.9 7 8 A similar study in 2014 found that at higher debt levels, odds of practicing in primary care 9 declined. However, it does not influence private school graduates based on debt levels.10 10 Another analysis in 2013 by the AMA found that at debt levels greater than $150,000 at the end 11 of graduation has a negative impact on choosing primary care specialities.11 12 13 While these studies exist, it is unclear whether or not tuition -free programs will he lp combat 14 shortage in underserved areas or primary care specialties. Two studies have also shown that 15 there is little to no direct correlation with debt levels and specialty choice, once again 16 highlighting the lack of definitive evidence on the causation b etween tuition -free programs and 17 specialty choice.11 18 19 DISCUSSION 20 21 Despite the already high cost of medical education, the price of attendance continues to rise. 22 This sharp increase in levels of indebtedness is occurring at a rate exceeding the both inflation 23 rate or increased physician compensation.12-14 In the 2018 -2019 academic year alone, medical 24 school tuition costs increased on average 3.1% for public institutions and 3.2% for private 25 institutions, totaling an annual tuition of $31,905 and $53,9 01.15 In efforts to ameliorate this 26 financial crisis, several institutions both public and private, have implemented tuition -free or 27 tuition -reduced programs. 28 29 The feasibility of addressing physician shortage through tuition -free medical education may be 30 limited to a select group of institutions. Based on the sourced existing data on medical school 31 endowment, enrollment and tuition expenses, only 20 medical schools were demonstrated to be 1 in an equal or more favorable financial position than NYU. Notably, these schools include 15 of 2 the top 20 U.S. research institutions. In addition, it took NYU over 11 years to raise the $600 3 million necessary to enact their program, with $100 million of the fund stemming from a single 4 donor and additional donations from m ore than 2,500 alumni, trustees and friends. Based on the 5 cumulative cost of tuition of $2.2 billion dollars for 86 medical schools who have published 6 tuition data, it would require an approximate endowment fundraising effort of $53 billion to offer 7 free t uition indefinitely.16 Still, while these figures are based solely on tuition alone, in 2009 it 8 was estimated that the annual variable cost, of educating a medical student was $62,887. For 9 this analysis, the minimum of the 95% confidence interval is a cost of $38,226, which only 33% 10 of medical schools (all of which are privately funded) could cover utilizing only tuition and fees.17 11 12 While meeting such monumental funding needs may be challenging, the American Association 13 of Medical Colleges (AAMC) has indi cated that most philanthropic contributions to medical 14 education come from donors who are unaffiliated with the institution. In 2016, 81% of donors to 15 AAMC member medical schools were from patients, families or other individuals within that 16 respective comm unity.18 The extent to which this sum may have been able to significantly 17 diminish the overall need for funding tuition -free education is unclear. As these initiatives 18 continue to develop, they present not only a method to immediately address the ongoing i ssue, 19 but also, and more importantly, provide objective, real -world measures regarding a variety of 20 interventions to curbside medical student indebtedness. 21 22 In addition to the obvious financial implications of increasing student debt, there exists a 23 poten tial, yet substantial, impact on the quantity of undergraduate medical students entering 24 primary care specialties. Currently, a body of evidence anecdotally and subjectively 25 demonstrates a causation between medical education debt and student or trainee spe cialty 26 choice. However, there is a paucity of studies that objectively investigate this association. Thus, 27 at this time no definitive conclusion can be stated regarding this subject matter. As more 28 schools implement tuition -free and tuition -reduced program s, the pool of objective data will 29 grow, enabling a crucial and objective evaluation of this potential relationship. Subsequent 30 studies are necessary to analyze the long -term impact of medical student indebtedness and 31 specialty choice. Further, these subse quent studies shall also investigate the long -term 32 sustainability of these tuition -free and tuition -reduced programs for the development of future 33 advocacy efforts. 34 35 RECOMMENDATIONS 36 37 Your Committee on Long Range Planning and your Committee on Medical Edu cation 38 recommend the following: 39 40 1. That our AMA -MSS continue to study this topic to gain a better understanding of the 41 sustainability of free and reduced medical tuition programs and of the efficacy of these 42 programs in effecting medical specialty choice; a nd 43 2. That our AMA -MSS regularly track the tuition reimbursement programs across medical 1 schools to monitor outcomes ; and 2 3.

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON LONG RANGE PLANNING MSS COLRP Report A A-19 Subject : Re-evaluation of AMA -MSS Region Bylaws Presented by : MSS Committee on Long Range Planning Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez , Chair) _______________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 In the COLRP Report A - A-17, your MSS Committee on Long Range Planning (COLRP) 3 assessed each Region's bylaws to determine if they were in compliance with the minimum 4 standards set forth in GC Report D, A -15. Additionally, your COLRP re -evaluated the 5 bylaws of each MSS Region in an attempt to better understand similarities and differences 6 between Regions. 7 8 The A -17 report recommended the following: 9 1.In alignment with MSS policy 665.012MSS, your COLRP recommends the 10 following: 11 a.That our MSS Speaker and Vice Speaker monitor all MSS Regions to 12 ensure compliance with the minimum requirements in GC Report D, A -15; 13 and 14 b.That our MSS COLRP reevaluate the accordance of each Region's bylaws 15 with the categories in Tables 1 - 5b and releas e its findings in an 16 informational report to the Assembly at A -19; 17 18 In the recommendations of the A -17 report, your COLRP was tasked to further re -evaluate 19 each Region's bylaws as described below. The findings of this evaluation are to be 20 released in an informational report to the MSS Assembly at A -19. This report assesses 21 each region's adherence to the minimum bylaw requirements outlined in the AMA -MSS 22 GC Report D, A -15, \"Evaluation of AMA -MSS Region Bylaws.\" The following report also 23 identifies how each region bylaw addresses the following categories: quorum, voting, 24 parliamentary procedure, and policy coordination. 25 26 METHODS 27 28 The most current bylaws adopted by each region were submitted to your COLRP in March 29 2019. Your COLRP acknowledges that some Reg ions may intend to update their bylaws 30 at the upcoming Annual meeting, and that the contents of this table may not reflect those 31 intentions. Your COLRP assessed the inclusion of minimum bylaws based on the AMA - 32 MSS GC Report D, A -15, \"Evaluation of AMA -MSS Region Bylaws\" as outlined in Table 1 33 and outlined each region's process for quorum, voting, parliamentary procedures, and 34 Table of Contents Next Previouspolicy coordination in Tables 2 - 5b. Region bylaws were compared to the MSS IOP in 1 effect as of March 2019. 2 3 RESULTS 4 5 I.

Each region was analyzed to see if they included the 9 minimum bylaw (Present), if they did no t (Absent), if their bylaws were contrary to MSS 10 IOP (Present, Different), or lacked the specificity requested in the MSS IOP (Present, 11 Incomplete). 12 13 All Regions met minimum bylaw standards on the following: description of the Region 14 Governing Council, and a clause on the purpose of the Medical Student Region is to elect 15 Regional Delegates to the House of Delegates. 16 17 All seven Regions delineate in their bylaws the responsibilities of the Region Chair. 18 However, the description of Region Chair responsibil ities for Regions 2, 4, 6, and 7 did not 19 include the level of detail requested per MSS IOP 8.1.3. 20 21 When examining the requirements for Regional Delegate Elections, only Region 7 met 22 minimum standards set forth by MSS IOP 8.3. Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 d oes not 23 include criteria for applicants who run from the floor and the requirement that they submit 24 their election materials within 60 days of their election to retain their position. In addition, 25 Region 2 does not require state endorsement. 26 27 In additio n, Regions 1, 2, 3, and 5 specifically detail how to determine the Regional 28 Delegation Chair. Region 7 does include mention the selection of the Region Delegation 29 Chair but does not have the level of detail required per MSS IOP 8.4 (no description of the 30 selection process and which delegates are able to be selected). Region 6 does include 31 detail on the selection of a Region Delegation, however it goes against MSS IOP 8.4 by 32 not allowing Alternate Delegates to be appointed as Region Delegation Chair. Region 4 33 has no clause detailing the determination of the Region Delegation Chair. 34 35 Region 7 bylaws fully describe the responsibilities of their Regional Delegation Chair. 36 Regions 1 and 5 are near complete but lack a clause stating that the Region Delegation 37 Chair will coordinate region authorship to the MSS. Region 2 has a very brief description 38 of Region Delegation Chair responsibilities; however, it lacks the detail required per MSS 39 IOP 8.4. Regions 3, 4, and 6 lack such a clause altogether. 40 41 In summation, your MSS COLRP found that no regions completely met the minimum 42 bylaws as recommended by AMA -MSS GC Report D, A -15 and thus all would require 43 some additions or changes. Region 1 had near complete bylaws, but would need to 44 include additional detail on the selection of the Regional Delegate (MSS IOP 8.3) and 45 would need to include additional detail on the responsibilities of the Region Delegation 46 Chair (MSS IOP 8.4). Region 2 had near complete bylaws, with the lack of detail 47 specifying the respo nsibilities of the Region Chair (MSS IOP 8.1.3), additional detail on 48 the selection of the Regional Delegate per (MSS IOP 8.3), and detail on the 49 responsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair (MSS IOP 8.4). Similarly, Region 3 had 50 near complete bylaws, w ith the exception of a missing clause which stated the 51 responsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair (MSS IOP 8.4) and missing detail on the 1 selection of the Regional Delegate (MSS IOP 8.3). In order for Region 4 to meet 2 minimum bylaw guidelines, the re gion must include additional details on the process in 3 which the Region Chair is selected and their responsibilities (MSS IOP 8.1.3) and must 4 create clauses which detail the determination of the Region Delegates (MSS IOP 8.3) and 5 the determination and resp onsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair (MSS IOP 8.4). In 6 order for Region 5 to meet all requirement, additional detail on the selection of the 7 Regional Delegate (MSS IOP 8.3) and additional detail on the responsibilities of the 8 Region Delegation Chair (MSS IOP 8.4) would need to be included. Region 6 is also 9 lacking details on the process in which the Region Delegation Chair is selected (MSS IOP 10 8.4) and the selection of the Regional Delegate (MSS IOP 8.3). They must also create 11 clauses which detail th e responsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair (MSS IOP 8.4) 12 and include that the Region Chair organize regional conferences (MSS IOP 8.1.3). 13 Region 6 also includes an exclusion where the Region Delegation Chair cannot be an 14 Alternate Delegate. This is currently at odds with MSS IOP 8.4 which states either a 15 Regional Delegate or the Alternate may be appointed at Region Delegation Chair. Region 16 7 currently lacks detail describing the Region Chair responsibilities (per MSS IOP 8.1.3) 17 and the selection of Region Delegation Chair (MSS IOP 8.4), and the full responsibilities 18 of the Region Delegation Chair (MSS IOP 8.4). 19 20 II. Quorum/Voting 21 22 Table 2 outlines each region's specific criteria for establishing quorum. The most popular 23 method to determine quorum is on e-third of total chapters with a minimum of 3 states in 24 that region present. Regions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7 abide by the aforementioned method. Only 25 Regions 2 and 5 require half of all chapters to be present with a minimum of 4 and 3 26 states, respectively. 27 28 Voting allocation by region varies significantly. Table 3 outlines each region's criteria for 29 voting allocation. Regions 2 and 4 all allocate one vote to each medical campus. Regions 30 3 allocates one vote, however that vote is for each medical school including the ir satellite 31 campuses. Region 6 also allocates one vote per medical school; however, it fails to clarify 32 if that one vote is for each medical school and all its satellite campuses or if each separate 33 campus would receive its own vote. Region 1 allows for e ach campus to receive two 34 votes, one for the Delegate and the second for the Alternate Delegate. Region 5 utilizes 35 campus enrollment in the AMA as a factor of the number of votes allocated. One vote is 36 given for every 100 students enrolled with each additi onal 50 giving the campus another 37 vote (e.g. 150 students = 2 votes). Region 7 is the only region which allocates votes to 38 states based on state attendance at the Regional Meeting. Each state is given one vote 39 for every three chapters that send a delegate to the Regional Meeting. 40 41 III. Parliamentary Procedure 42 43 The AMA - Assembly as per MSS IOP 4.4.5.1 utilizes the Standard Code of Parliamentary 44 Procedure. Table 4 outlines the body of parliamentary procedure utilized during business 45 meetings for each region. Regi ons 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 follow the Standard Code of 46 Parliamentary Procedure. Region 5 employs Davis' Rules of Order. 47 48 IV. Policy Coordination 49 50 Policy coordination includes resolution writing oversight and facilitation, region resolution 1 sponsorship, and any o ther efforts which may yield policy for the AMA or the AMA -MSS. 2 Table 5a outlines the systems each region utilizes to coordinate resolution writing. Every 3 region has at least one coordinator although the title varies between Legislative Chair, 4 Advocacy Cha ir, or Policy Chair. Region 3 also has a Legislative Vice Chair to support the 5 efforts of the Legislative Chair. In addition to these individuals, Regions 2, 3, 5 and 6 have 6 policy focused committees. Regions 2 and 5 create a resolution committee that ove rsees 7 the resolution writing process. Region 6 and Region 3 have a legislative committee, but 8 the bylaws do not detail the explicit purpose of the committee. The methods in which 9 these committees are assembled and who is qualified to be a part of the commi ttee 10 across bylaws have various levels of detail, which may be a point of confusion for 11 members. 12 13 Region sponsorship of resolutions can be found at Table 5b. Only one region, Region 2, 14 utilizes their Resolution Committee to decide whether a resolution wil l gain regional 15 authorship. The remaining Regions all utilize a majority vote in favor to determine 16 authorship. Regions 1, 3, 5 require that two -thirds of the vote cast be in favor for region 17 authorship. Region 4, 6, and 7 utilize a simple majority vote in favor for region authorship. 18 19 20 CONCLUSION 21 22 In summation, the primary aim of this report was to assess if Regions included required 23 bylaw elements as outlined in AMA -MSS GC Report D, A -15, \"Evaluation of AMA -MSS 24 Region Bylaws.\" Regions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 all lack or include incomplete bylaw 25 elements when compared to AMA -MSS GC Report D. Your COLRP highly recommends 26 these Regions update their bylaws to ensure they have included all the minimum required 27 elements in sufficient detail. 28 29 In addition to the aforementioned assessment, your COLRP was able to compare region 30 bylaws regarding the categories of quorum, voting allocation, parliamentary procedure, 31 and policy coordination. Correspondingly to the A -17 report, this report continued to show 32 that ther e are differences between region bylaws in all categories compared. Your COLRP 33 hopes that their analysis will encourage Regions to critically examine their own bylaws as 34 well as gain insight on the variety of approaches Regions can use to conduct business. 35 36 RECOMMENDATIONS 37 38 In alignment with MSS policy 665.012MSS, your COLRP recommends the following: 39 40 1. That our MSS Speaker and Vice Speaker monitor all MSS Regions to ensure 41 compliance with the minimum requirements in GC Report D, A -15; and 42 2. That Region 1 modify their bylaws to specify the selection of the Regional 43 Delegate and the responsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair to be in 44 accordance with MSS IOP 8.3 and MSS IOP 8.4; and 45 3. That Region 2 modify their bylaws to specify the responsibilities of the Region 46 Delegation Chair and Region Chair and specify the selection of the Regional 47 Delegate to be in accordance with MSS IOP 8.4, MSS IOP 8.1.3 and MSS IOP 8.3 48 respectively; and 49 4. That Region 3 modify their bylaws to specify the selection of the Regional 1 Delegate and responsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair to be in accordance 2 with MSS IOP 8.3 and MSS IOP 8.4; and 3 5. That Region 4 modify their bylaws to include the process in which the Region 4 Chair and, Region Delegates, and Region Delegation Chair are s elected and the 5 responsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair and Region Chair to be in 6 accordance with MSS IOP 8.1.3, MSS IOP 8.5, and MSS IOP 8.4; and 7 6. That Region 5 modify their bylaws to specify the selection of the Regional 8 Delegate and the responsi bilities of the Region Delegation Chair to be in 9 accordance with MSS IOP 8.3 and MSS IOP 8.4; and 10 7. That Region 6 modify their bylaws to include details on the process in which the 11 Region Delegation Chair and Region Delegate is selected and the responsibilit ies 12 of the Region Delegation Chair and Region Chair, and eliminate the exclusion 13 where the Region Delegation Chair cannot be an Alternate Delegate to be in 14 accordance with MSS IOP 8.1.3. MSS IOP 8.3, and MSS IOP 8.4; and 15 8. That Region 7 modify their bylaws to describe the Region Chair responsibilities 16 and the selection and responsibilities of the Region Delegation Chair to be in 17 accordance with MSS IOP 8.1.3 and MSS MSS -COLRP reevaluate the accordance of each Region's bylaws with 19 the ca tegories in Tables 1 - 5b and release its findings in an informational report to 20 the Assembly at A -21; and 21 10. The remainder of this report be filed. 22 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This report was assembled by the 2018 -19 AMA -MSS Committee on Long -Range Kantesaria, Rebecca Haines, Nathan Hoff, Kristan Baird, and Thomas Pak).

The MSS Reference 21 Committee did not believe the proposed language would achieve the spirit of the resolution. 22 23 Regarding Resolution 17 -I-18, staff experts expressed three main concerns. First, while the 24 AMA supports research, the reduction of psychedelics from Schedule 1 drugs has significant 25 problematic implications for the AMA. The FDA, which controls the scheduling of dru gs, is 26 guided by laws, implying that the AMA would not be able to advocate for the reduction of 27 psychedelic scheduling with out spending a significant amount of political and financial capital. 28 Doing so would affect AMA's ability to pursue its current agend as. Second, the political and 29 public relations aspect of supporting the removal of psychedelics from schedule one would be 30 significant and difficult to overcome. This again would take significant financial and political 31 Table of Contents Next Previouscapital. Lastly, the AMA would need to consider the public health effects of reducing the severity 1 of psychedelic usages. 2 3 BACKGROUND 4 5 There is a complex cultural and political history regarding psychedelic drugs, which include, 6 among others, mescaline, lysergic (LSD), psilocybin, and N,N (DMT). The first legislative limitation of psychedelic use occur red through 8 amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in 1965. In this amendment, 9 psychedelic drugs were grouped with known drugs of abuse with the adoption of the following 10 language:15 11 12 \"The definition of a depressant or stimulant drug, howev er, includes the following 13 significant language: any drug which contains any quantity which the Secretary [of the 14 Department of Health, Education, and Welfare], after investigation, has found to have, 15 and by regulation designates as having, a potential for abuse because of its depressant 16 or stimulant effect on the central nervous system or its hallucinogenic effect.\"15 17 18 Following this, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 was passed, which places \"all 19 substances which were in some manner regulated un der existing federal law into one of five 20 schedules.\"19. Congress established Schedule I for drugs with (1) high potential for abuse, (2) 21 no accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and (3) a lack of accepted safety for 22 use under medical sup ervision.10 23 24 The major factor distinguishing substances in Schedule I from the others is established and 25 accepted medical use in treatment in the United States.6 However, there is D.C. Circuit Court 26 precedent stating that a substance or drug with \"no curre ntly accepted medical use\" should not 27 automatically be placed into Schedule I.9 The court ruling asserted that the legislative history of 28 the Controlled Substances Act indicates that medical use is but one factor to be considered, is 29 by no means the most i mportant one, and that to treat medical use as the controlling factor in 30 classification decisions is to render irrelevant the other findings required by the CSA's 31 scheduling criteria. Moreover, scheduling practices currently in place support the conclusion that 32 substances that lack an established medical use need not always be placed in Schedule 1, 33 exemplified by substances such as poppy straw that have no currently accepted medical use 34 but are categorized in Schedule II.6 35 36 Despite the findings in this cour t ruling, no changes were made as the ruling was filed in dicta , in 37 other words, as an opinion from an authoritative body and not binding, exemplifying the power 38 the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) holds over scheduling of substances and an explanation 39 as to why and how the DEA has refused rescheduling of certain substances.6 This is furthered 40 by a 2001 administrative decision by the DEA to deny a petition to initiate rulemaking 41 proceedings to reschedule marijuana.10 42 43 Due to the differences in professional entity and authoritative body decisions over substance 44 scheduling, the DEA's sole decision -making power over scheduling has been criticized. It is 45 argued that scheduling criteria that cannot be consistently followed and that is open to 46 interpretation is f undamentally flawed, making the scheduling of substances by a political law 47 enforcement agency at odds with those that want to study substances for their medical or 48 scientific benefit.6 49 50 There is also significant evidence that the geopolitical context from the early 1900s to the 1960s 1 was largely responsible for the development of drug schedules, the eventual formation of the 2 Controlled Substances Act of 1970, and amendments thereafter. According to McAllister8, it was 3 thought, even at that time, that only opiates and coca -based drugs were deemed addictive, 4 while central nervous system stimulants and depressants, hallucinogens, and other classes of 5 drugs acted differently upon the body and therefore could not be addictive. Thus, they would 6 not fit the sched ule I classification. It is argued that pro -control advocates used these schedules 7 as a form of geopolitical and financial control, not a way to regulater psychotropics according to 8 careful scientific evaluation.8 9 10 Upon closer look at the socio -political environment in the United States at the time of passing of 11 the Controlled Substances Act, there is concern over the intention of the law. The original 12 publicized intent was to rationalize and liberalize American drug policies, and to support 13 flexibility a nd innovation in managing substances. Instead, it is argued that it was used as a 14 punitive system of drug control. From the so -called \"crack epidemic\" and \"war on drugs,\" there 15 have been amendments and changes to the Controlled Substances Act that have t urned it into 16 \"the chief prop of federal law enforcement and means of underclass criminal incapacitation.\"3 17 18 Scientifically speaking, there is a large amount of evidence that psychedelics exhibit promise as 19 therapeutics for a number of disorders including mood disorders, substance use disorders, and 20 headaches, among others. One prospective longitudinal study of more than 900 \"marginalized 21 women\", who are disproportionately at risk for suicide, showed that subjects who used 22 psychedelic drugs were at no signi ficant hazard for suicidal ideation or attempt while subjects 23 naive to psychedelic drugs were at nearly five times greater risk of suicide ideation or attempt. 24 Additionally, the study showed that subjects with regular opioid use were at a three time great er 25 risk of suicidal ideation, whereas psychedelic use did not increase suicidal ideation.1 26 27 A systematic review of published clinical treatment studies using psychedelics showed that 28 unipolar mood disorders, the current treatment for which is often suboptimal, can be improved 29 by the psychedelic drugs lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin. These drugs were used 30 frequently in the treatment of mood disorders prior to their prohibition in the 1960s in the United 31 States. This review identified a rec ent study done in the United Kingdom showing that 32 psilocybin shows promise in the treatment of resistant depressive disorder. The review asserts 33 that psychedelics should be re -examined in modern trials, especially for unipolar mood 34 disorders.16 35 36 Other stu dies have shown, for example, that long -term ayahuasca use improves subject's 37 positive perception of health and correlates with healthy lifestyles, increased personal values, 38 and reduced prescription drug use,11 that both psilocybin and ayahuasca may be ef 39 treating treatment -resistant depression,13,14 that ketamine psychedelic therapy may help with 40 alcohol use disorder treatment,7 and that cluster headaches may be effectively treated by both 41 psilocybin and LSD.18 There has also been research supporting that \"microdosing\" of 42 psychedelics led to improved psychological functions of connection, contemplation, focus, 43 happiness, productivity, and wellness.\"15 44 45 Many studies conclude with a general call for further studie s in this area. One study looking at 46 the use of psychedelics for drug -assisted psychotherapy for mental illness stated that the 47 current scheduling of psychedelics (at schedule I) has impeded research negatively.2 Another 48 study looking at the effect of psi locybin and LSD in reducing anxiety and depression in cancer 49 patients and those with a history of addiction concluded that both these substances showed 50 great promise. However, these authors also concluded that the studies done thus far have not 51 had enough subjects or long enough duration to firmly conclude the benefits of these 1 substances. The authors also reiterated and stressed the need for new and more thorough 2 studies and trials.5 3 4 One of the major concerns with rescheduling of psychedelic substances is the potential dangers 5 associated with using these substances in research or patient treatment. One study looked at 6 mutagenicity or genetic damage potentially due to LSD, and found that at \"normal\" dosages, 7 there were no findings of chromosomal or genet ic damage; however, the authors gave the 8 qualifier that these effects may still be possible at \"extreme\" dosages.4 In another study looking 9 at the use of psychedelics in the treatment of unipolar mood disorders, there was no evidence to 10 support that psyche delics carried a risk of dependence when used as treatment.16 11 12 While studies generally purport the safety as well as the efficacy of treatment with psychedelics, 13 one study looking at the effect of LSD on the body showed also that there were no serious acu te 14 adverse events observed, but that the substance carried the risk of sympathomimetic 15 stimulation. Observed symptoms included increased blood pressure, heart rate, body 16 temperature, pupil size, cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine.17 17 18 DISCUSSI ON 19 20 First and foremost, current scientific findings urge further experimentation over limiting access 21 and dosage to psychedelics as a group. The large amount of evidence showing the potential of 22 psychedelics as powerful therapeutics contradict the placemen t of this drug group in Schedule 23 1, since the traditional justification of this placement is the criteria of \"no present medical use.\" 24 25 The continuation of resistance to updates in current drug scheduling in general not only reflects 26 a reactionary culture , but also hinders our knowledge and innovation in an entire group of 27 potential medications, which is arguably the bigger threat to the United States' capacity as a 28 leader in the scientific and economic realms. In terms of medical use, research has not yet 29 demonstrated the cause and effect of any single chemical in large trials, which appears to be a 30 result of limited supply and funding due to the Schedule 1 label. Eventually, each chemical will 31 likely need its own individual characterization as prelimina ry studies show that they exhibit 32 different physiological effects. 33 34 Several clinical trials have shown dramatic positive effects of psychedelics for patients with 35 mental illnesses such as medication -resistant depression, PTSD, and anxiety. However, all 36 articles state the need for longer term research or greater numbers for their research. The lack 37 of availability primarily stems from legal regulations. Although researchers can now apply online 38 on the DEA website ( https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/drugreg/index.html ) to register with the 39 DEA and submit their research protocol(s) to conduct research on Schedule 1 drugs, in this 40 manner the DEA continues to be the authority on whether a substance maintains its 41 classification in a certain schedule and whether the researchers are allowed to conduct the 42 studies outlined in their protocol pursuant to meeting certain criteria (e.g. appropriate 43 qualifications of investigators as noted on CVs, j ustification of amount of Schedule 1 substance 44 needed and source of supply, detailed experimental procedures, duration of project, and 45 security provisions for storing and dispensing the Schedule I substance). As the system 46 currently stands, we are caught i n an impasse even though investigators have published 47 evidence to suggest that psychedelics are substances with (1) low potential for abuse, (2) 48 measurable medical use in treatment in the United States, and (3) proven safety while used in 49 clinical trials u nder medical supervision. Although these studies have been publicly available, 50 regulators continue to designate psychedelics in a manner that impedes their further study and 1 potential use as therapeutics. 2 3 The Committee on Scientific Issues sought guidan ce from AMA Staff with expertise in drug 4 scheduling. The current opinion in the realm of policy is that psychedelics have not met the 5 minimum scientific threshold to be reclassified and that current procedures to register 6 researchers and institutions and a llow them to conduct research on Schedule 1 drugs in a 7 heavily supervised manner is sufficient to gather evidence on the potential therapeutic use of 8 psychedelics. However, these substances have shown therapeutic potential for multiple disease 9 processes an d simply making the application process easier to perform investigations on 10 Schedule 1 drugs, without lowering the barriers to execute the research, does not provide the 11 necessary incentives for researchers and pharmaceutical companies to carry out high -powered, 12 Phase III clinical trials to test the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of psychedelics. 13 14 With these statements in mind, the following conclusions are presented with the understanding 15 that the likely political and capital investment of implementin g this report is substantial and these 16 recommendations have the potential for uncomfortable discourse at the House of Delegates. 17 However, the Committee on Scientific Issues believes the scientific findings regarding the 18 therapeutic uses of psychedelics by multiple investigators deserves re -consideration and further 19 discourse within the medical community given the potential efficacy of their use in mental and 20 public health as shown by the available clinical trials to date. 21 22 Regarding the verbiage of this re solution, the Committee on Scientific Issues agrees that, from 23 the evidence gathered here, all RESOLVED clauses have merit. It was agreed that the first 24 RESOLVED, instead of asking the AMA to review the scheduling of psychedelics, should 25 instead ask for t he AMA to call directly for rescheduling of psychedelics. This also addresses 26 the concern for feasibility of the current language, as the power of the AMA to \"review\" 27 scheduling was in question. 28 29 For RESOLVED 2, there is also sufficient evidence from the legal standpoint to support that 30 there are \"high regulatory and cultural barriers\" which have been politicized by placing the 31 decision -making process of drug scheduling with the DEA. It was also thought that RESOLVED 32 2 is necessary as a stand -alone clause since it targets the \"non -clinical\" arguments currently 33 used by the Drug Enforcement Agency to maintain psychedelics in the Schedule 1 34 classification. This is a powerful clause that is needed to begin to dissociate the cultural, 35 religious, political, and personal biases from the clinical world of science. 36 37 The third RESOLVED ties together the ideas introduced in RESOLVED 1 and RESOLVED 2. It 38 was agreed that introducing \"benefits and adverse effects\" to the the clause would neutralize the 39 currently negative language. It also would focus the aim of the RESOLVED to the efficacy of 40 these substances in addressing medical issues, in addition to promoting the research and 41 consequences of using these consequences. 42 43 RECOMMENDATIONS 44 45 Your Committee on Scientific Issues recommends that the following recommendations are 46 adopted and the remainder of the report is filed: 47 48 1. RESOLVED, Our AMA calls for the status of psychedelics as Schedule 1 substances be 1 reclassified into a lower schedule class reviewed with the goal of facilitating clinical 2 research and developing psychedelic -based medicines; and be it further 3 2. RESOLVED, That, given the high regulatory and cultural barriers, our AMA explicitly 4 supports and promotes research into the therapeutic potential of psychedelics to help 5 make a more conducive environment for research; and be it further 6 3. RESOLVED, That our AMA supports and promotes research to determine the benefits 7 and adverse effects consequences of long -term ps ychedelic use. 8 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS References: 1. Argento, E., et al.

REPORT OF THE MEDICAL STUDENT SECTION COMMITTEE ON WOMEN IN MEDICINE AND COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION AND ADVOCACY MSS WIM COLA Report A A-19 Subject: Secondhand Smoke in Pregnant Women Presented by: MSS Committee on Women in Medicine and Committee of Legislation and Advocacy Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (Danny Vazquez, Chair) ___________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION 1 2 At the 2018 Interim meeting, the AMA -MSS referred for study MSS Resolution 05 - \"Inclusion of 3 Pregnant Women in the Secondhand Smoke Driving Ban\" which requests an amendment to 4 Secondhand Smoke Policy H -490.910 with the following: 5 6 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -490.910, Secondhand Smoke, by addition 7 as follows: 8 9 Secondhand Smoke, H -490.910 10 11 1. Our AMA urges the President of the United States to issue an Executive Order making 12 all federal workplaces, including buildings and campuses, entirely sm oke free and urges 13 its federation members to do the same. 14 2. Our AMA supports legislation that prohibits smoking while operating or riding in a vehicle 15 that contains children and pregnant women. 16 17 I-18 MSS Reference Committee received testimony in support of the spirit of this resolution, but 18 harbored extensive concerns that this resolution unintentionally supports the criminalization of 19 pregnant woman who smoke, or pregnant women who are near secondhand smoke, and 20 expressed concerns that Resolution 05 thre atens the autonomy of pregnant women. 21 22 While acknowledging the concerns of the Reference Committee, testimony was given to the I -18 23 MSS Assembly stating that the issue was too important to not be further investigated. This was 24 found to be compelling by the assembly. Accordingly, the MSS Women in Medicine Committee 25 has produced this report, which details the effects of secondhand smoke on pregnancy and 26 explores alternative methods to legislation to enact the spirit of the resolution. 27 28 Table of Contents PreviousBACKGROUND 1 2 Smoking dur ing pregnancy is a well -established source of harm to the pregnant mother and the 3 developing fetus. Smoking during pregnancy can result in premature delivery, low birth weight, 4 restricted fetal growth, birth defects, and sudden infant death syndrome. Cigar ette smoke is a 5 known teratogen resulting in higher incidences of spontaneous abortion, premature ablatio 6 placentae, reduced weight at birth, and congenital deformities (cheilognathopalatoschisis, 7 deformed extremities, polycystic kidneys, aortopulmonary se ptum defects, gastroschisis, skull 8 deformation, etc.) . In addition, smoking during pregnancy increases an infant's risk of 9 developing ear infections, respiratory infections, and asthma. There is also increased risk of 10 these outcomes for the child when a pr egnant woman is exposed to passive or secondhand 11 smoke (abbreviated SHS henceforth). The woman herself is at higher risk for stroke, coronary 12 artery disease, lung and bladder cancer due to her increased exposure to smoke. It was 13 estimated in 2011 -2012, 58 million people were exposed to SHS, and SHS exposure causes 14 more than 41,000 deaths among nonsmoking adults and 400 deaths in infants each year 1. 15 16 Homes and vehicles are the most common place in which people are exposed to SHS, which 17 can result in the harmful effects outlined above on a pregnant mother and the fetus (CDC). Data 18 from the US and other countries has shown the value of comprehensive smok e-free legislation's 19 impact on exposure levels in public places and further voluntary adoption of smoke -free rules in 20 homes 2,3. Other interventions, such as counseling pregnant women and members of their home 21 on the risks of SHS, have also been effective in reducing pregnant women's exposure to SHS 22 as well as reducing the risks of low -birthweight or preterm infant 4. 23 24 Research has also shown vulnerable populations are often the ones in which SHS exposure is 25 most prevalent. This includes non -Hispanic Afric an Americans, those with a lower 26 socioeconomic status (SES), women who are unwed, and those who rent. 1,5 This further 27 portrays the necessity to limit smoking to prevent further development of health disparities 28 among vulnerable populations' mothers and ch ildren. 29 30 Despite more people being taught about the dangers of smoking while pregnant, research 31 shows that many pregnant mothers across the US still smoke while pregnant. For instance, 32 West Virginia has the highest prevalence of smoking during pregnancy a t 25.1% followed by 33 Kentucky at 18.4%, Montana at 16.5%, and Missouri at 15.3%.6 Some mothers increase levels 34 of smoking after birth, and seven of ten women who cease smoking during pregnancy return to 35 smoking after delivery. 7 A 2012 study found that the majority of smoking parents exposed their 36 children to SHS in their cars at least some of the time, and only 12% of parents who smoked 37 were advised about the risks of smoking in their cars by pediatricians.8 38 39 Laws that restrict smoking in the presence of c hildren/pregnant women generally have a 40 positive impact on children's health. In California, the introduction of the ban on smoking in cars 41 with children resulted in a 12% annual decline of students reporting exposure to smoke in cars. 42 In the 4 years prior to the introduction of this law there was less than a 1% annual decline in 43 exposure. Additionally, those students who reported being exposed to smoking in cars were 44 more likely to have asthma and more likely to consider smoking in the future.9 Generally, a 1 violation of these non -smoking laws results in a fine.10 2 3 DISCUSSION 4 5 Smoking presents many risks to the health of a developing fetus. Cigarette smoke is a known 6 teratogen, can result in pregnancy complications, and even in the case of normal birth, can 7 drastically affect a child's long -term health, and it is evident that SHS can result in the death of 8 the fetus or long term health complications. 9 10 Methods that have a proven impact on maternal/fetal health include the encouragement of 11 smoking cessation pr ograms for women who are pregnant, planning for pregnancy, and for their 12 housemates. Existing smoke -free policies in a wide variety of settings have resulted in 13 significant reductions in adverse early -life health outcomes. These findings are due to 14 decreas ed SHS exposure during pregnancy and childhood, and to successful campaigns to 15 decrease smoking during pregnancy. States that have implemented legislation prohibiting 16 smoking in vehicles with children have seen significant reductions in children's exposure to 17 smoke in this environment. Violations of these laws generally result in fines for parents. 18 19 While there is clearly a medical need to reduce pregnant womens' exposure to smoke, 20 legislation is not a prudent course of action due to the nature of such a la w restricting the bodily 21 autonomy of a mother or unintentionally criminalizing pregnant women who smoke. 22 Furthermore, the enforcement of such laws may be logistically difficult, with issues such as who 23 is to be fined and the difficulty of determining wheth er a woman is pregnant. The pregnant 24 woman may choose not to disclose such information and it is not always possible to determine if 25 a woman is pregnant just by her gross appearance). 26 27 Current discussion between physicians and patients regarding adverse ef fects of SHS are low. 28 Healthcare workers have a responsibility to discuss the dangers of childhood SHS exposure 29 with mothers and other relevant family members. Promoting such communication would be a 30 more valuable allocation of the AMA's resources (as oppo sed to advocating for such 31 legislation). 32 33 RECOMMENDATIONS 34 35 Your Committee on Women in Medicine and Committee of Legislation and Advocacy 36 recommends that the following recommendations are not adopted and the remainder of the 37 report is filed: 38 39 RESOLVED, That our AMA amend policy H -490.910, Secondhand Smoke, by addition 40 as follows: 41 42 Secondhand Smoke, H -490.910 43 44 1. Our AMA urges the President of the United States to issue an Executive Order making 1 all federal workplaces, including buildings and campuses, entirely smoke free and urges 2 its federation members to do the same. 3 2. Our AMA supports legislation that prohibits smoking while operating or riding in a vehicle 4 that contains children and pregnant women. 5 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS References: 1.

The following are common examples of issues that are NOT best addressed through an MSS resolution: The resolution addresses an issue that could be resolved by the AMA-MSS Governing Council, specifically by submitting a GC Action Item request . The resolution addresses a medical school-specific issue that would be more appropriately addressed by medical school faculty or administration. The resolution addresses a specialty-specific issue that would be more appropriately addressed by the relevant medical specialty society or other member group of the AMA House of Delegates. The resolution addresses a state-specific issue that would be more appropriately addressed by a state medical society . The resolution addresses an issue that is already sufficiently covered by existing AMA Policy or existing AMA-MSS Policy . 2) Resolutions that succeed in the MSS are well-researched and novel, and add value to the policy compendiums of the AMA or AMA-MSS. Authors must understand what has been attempted and accomplished in the past in order to produce strong resolutions for the future. Review the AMA Strategic Focus Areas and MSS Internal Policy Objectives to understand the priority issues for our organization (see scoring rubric below). Review existing AMA Policy and existing AMA-MSS Policy . Review the Proceedings from past years' MSS meetings (current through A-17, please contact your Delegates for further information) for examples of what policy proposals have and have not been successful in its Assembly Writing Your Resolution 1) Use this Resolution Writing Guide to assist you in writing resolution content, and use the Resolution Formatting Template to assist you in finalizing your resolution to Assembly standards. 2) For external resolutions (those that call for the AMA to act, not the AMA-MSS), understand that there is an additional expectation that authors will do their due diligence in research, soliciting appropriate feedback, and making appropriate contacts. This expectation is more rigorous than for internal resolutions (resolutions that call for the AMA-MSS to act). Authors of external resolutions should ensure that their topic is appropriate for external submission and aligns wi th AMA's Strategic Focus Areas: a. Delivering Care b. Practice Management c. Education 3 3) For external resolutions, authors should be aware that if their item should pass, it will not be brought forward to the AMA House of Delegates until the following national meeting. However, authors must be prepared to complete the following: a. Sign a virtual acknowledgement agreeing to help the Section Delegates and Regional Delegates in bringing their resolution to the AMA HOD if their resolution is passed by the Assembly. b. Work with the AMA-MSS Delegate and Alternate Delegate in advance of the following national meeting in order to help in the passage of their item, including submitting written testimony in support of the item. 4) For external resolutions that call for immediate forwarding to the House of Delegates following the same MSS meeting at which they are passed authors must be aware that: a. Only in rare cases are resolutions forwarded immediately to the HOD. b. There must be unusual circumstances deserving of immediate consideration by the HOD. c. The MSS Delegate and Alternate Delegate must be contacted re garding the author's intentions well in advance of the actual meeting. d. Authors must submit written testimony to the MSS Delegate and Alternate Delegate for submission to the HOD. e. Authors must attend the MSS Caucus on Saturday afternoon/evening in order to help with strategy for passage of their resolution. 5) Note about action verbs in Resolved clauses: When writing a Resolved clause, the action verb selected by the authors is extremely important during consideration of the resolution. The magnitude of the action requested by this action verb factors into the scoring process, with implications on a resolution's feasibility and its eventual fiscal note. Please see below for several examples of action verbs. Scoring rubrics can be found on pages 5-7. Support: Support indicates that the AMA-MSS /AMA has taken a position on the issue at hand, but does not require time-specific action. Support is appropriate for many types of resolutions, from broad principles to timely actions taken by third parties which would benefit from AMA-MSS/AMA support. Recognize: Recognize functions similarly to \"support\" as an action verb, but suggests that the topic matter would benefit from a low level of additional recognition (e.g. a statement, an article). Recognize cannot be used to re-establish support for something that already exists in policy. It is often associated with new and time-sensitive issues. Promote: Promote suggests that the AMA-MSS/AMA devote resources to increase awareness of the issue at hand. This may be with specific stakeholders, with specific populations, or to the public at large. Promote is most effective when education is significant to solving the issue. Advocate / Lobby / Call upon: Advocate, lobby, call upon, and other similar action verbs often indicate that the AMA Advocacy Office in Washington, DC will take timely action on the issue at hand. In some cases, these action verbs may direct other divisions of the AMA-MSS/AMA to take action, but these action verbs are commonly associated with action involving the federal government. Due to its active nature, resolutions with these action verbs are carefully examined and input from the Advocacy Office is solicited when appropriate. The need for faster action is considered especially in the use of these action verbs. It should be noted that oth er action verbs, such as \"support\", do not preclude active advocacy. Encourage / Urge: Encourage and urge are action verbs similar to advocate, lobby, and call upon, but at a lower level of intensity. They indicate that the appropriate division of the AMA-MSS/AMA will reach 4 out to the appropriate party to further an agenda on the issue at hand. In addition to government entities, encourage and urge are also used in the context of the AMA- MSS/AMA's relationship with non - governmental organizations. Research / Study: Research and study are action verbs which ask the AMA-MSS/AMA to further investigate an issue and provide information for the Assembly/House of Delegates to take action on at a future time. It is important to note that the AMA is not a research institution: it does not employ principal investigators or conduct scientific trials. However, the Committees/Councils (comprised of medical students/physicians who are subject matter experts in various topics) and staff can collaborate to investigate existing evidence on an issue and produce a report with recommendations that the Assembly/House of Delegates can discuss at a later time. Develop: Develop is an action verb that directs the AMA-MSS/AMA to contribute to existing discussion on an issue through the release of a report, guidelines, or another type of non-research document. It is similar to research and study in that the product will likely require some level of literature review, but develop indicates that further opinion or recommendation - often public facing - is needed. Identify: Identify is a vague action verb which commonly suggests that the AMA-MSS/AMA will investigate the issue at hand and provide a conclusion and possibly recommendations. It is similar to research and study, but may be used to suggest that a particular aspect of the issue requires special attention. It should be noted that identify could bias study results, and as such should be used carefully. Collaborate / Partner / Work with: The AMA-MSS/AMA works with many organizations across the nation to further the goals of all involved. These action verbs are generally paired with another action verb from this list (e.g. \"work with ... to develop ...\"). Collaboration is encouraged, especially in issues where the AMA shares scope with other organizations. Oppose / Condemn / Object to: These negative action verbs are generally not favored over positive action verbs (for example, the AMA should support something rather than oppose the opposite). However, there are situations in which the AMA-MSS/AMA is obliged to object to an issue, and in these cases, these verbs may be used. It should be noted that the AMA generally does not oppose specific pieces of legislation. These verbs establish a position for the organization, and may also indicate the need for further action, such as public statements and advocacy. 6) Note about withdrawal of resolutions: All submitted final resolutions will become the business of the MSS Assembly on May 2, 2019 at 12:00 AM CST. Primary authors will have the opportunity to withdraw their resolutions if desired before this deadline. 5 MSS Annual Meeting 2019 Resolution Scoring Rubric Authorship (5 points ) This will be assigned by the MSS Delegates. Was this resolution authored on behalf of an entire Section (3 points), State (4 points), or Region (5 points)? Otherwise, 0 points awarded. Clarity (10 points) Are the Whereas clauses succinctly stated and do they clearly support the requested action of the Resolved clauses? Do the Whereas clauses create a logical, coherent argument flowing naturally to support the Resolved clauses? Do none, some, or all of the Whereas clauses support the Resolved clauses? Do any Whereas clauses leave you with questions about the issue or about the argument? Research (30 points ) How many total references, and are they from appropriate authorities on the subject matter? Are none, some, or all of the references from trustworthy, high quality, evidence-based sources (e.g. peer- reviewed journals, respected news sources)? Are none, some, or all from the past 5 years? Are none, some, or all of the factual assertions in the Whereas clauses supported by sufficient evidence? Scope (10 points ) Does this resolution address a new, broad principle that will be applicable to multiple issues OR does it address a specific, current, actionable and timely issue? Feasibility (15 points ) Is the resolution feasible, appropriate, and within the general scope of issues for the AMA (external) or AMA- MSS (internal) to address? Fiscal Note (considered under Feasibility) Is the fiscal note high? Did the authors amend language to decrease fiscal note? (Please see Fiscal Note Rubric for reference. ) Novelty (15 points) Does this resolution address a subject matter largely neglected by current policy; add in a valuable way to existing policy; or depart from or oppose current AMA policy or AMA-MSS policy? Focus (10 points) Do the Resolved clauses address one or more principles of the AMA's Strategic Focus Arcs OR the MSS' Internal Policy Objectives (IPOs)? AMA Strategic Focus Arcs: (a) Delivering Care; (b) Practice Management; (c) Education. MSS Internal Policy Objectives (IPOs): (1) Pursuing innovative mechanisms to improve medical student wellness and mitigate burnout; (2) Cultivating the delivery of equitable healthcare to diverse patient populations in a dynamic environment, including via the promotion of diversity within the medical profession; and (3) Addressing emergent public health threats with impactful and evidence- based solutions. Response to Feedback (5 points ) This will be assigned by the MSS Delegates. Did the authors respond to scoring and feedback in a way that demonstrated their appreciation for the critiques? For full credit, authors need not necessarily change their resolution, but their responses to feedback must indicate that they have thought through and responded to objections to their resolution. 6 Resolution Scoring Rubric Authorship* (5 points) 0 3 (School Section) 4 (State) 5 (Region) Clarity (10 points) 0 (Whereas clauses do not support Resolved clauses; difficult to follow argument) 5 (Some arguments are missing to support the Resolved clauses; argument is unclear at times) 10 (Whereas clauses clearly support the Resolved clauses; argument clear and logical) Research (30 points) 0 (None of the Whereas clauses are supported by recent, appropriate sources) 5-10 (Less than half to few whereas clauses are supported by recent, appropriate sources) 15 (Half of the Whereas clauses are supported by recent, appropriate sources) 20-25 (Most to nearly all Whereas clauses have sufficient, appropr iately sourced evidence) 30 (All of the Whereas clauses are supported by recent, appropriate sources) Scope (10 points) 0 (too specific, not timely or actionable) 5 (specific, but questionably timeliness or actionability) 10 (broad in scope OR specific, timely and actionable) Feasib ility (15 points) 0 (likely infeasible and clearly not within AMA or MSS purview; fiscal note concerning) 5(questionably feasible, and unlikely to be within AMA or MSS purview; fiscal note concerning) 10 (likely within purview of AMA or MSS, questionably feasible; fiscal note not concerning) 15 (definitely feasible and clearly within purview of AMA or MSS; fiscal note not concerning) Novelty (15 points) 0 (completely covered by existing policy) 5 (largely covered by existi ng policy) 10 (less significant change to existing policy) 15 (new subject matter or significant departure from existing policy) Focus (10 points) 0 (does not address any IPO or Strategic Focus Arc) 3 (loosely addresses Strategic Focus Arc, does not address any IPO) 5 (loosely addresses IPO or Strategic Focus Arc) 8 (clearly addresses Strategic Focus Arc) 10 (clearly addresses IPO +/ - Strategic Focus Arc) Response to feedback* (5 po ints) 0 (authors did not respond to scoring and feedback appropriately) 5 (authors responded to scoring and feedback appropriately) * Indicates categories that are scored by the MSS Section Delegates. 7 AMA Medical Student Section Fiscal Note Rubric Expertise Available # of Departments Involved Timeline Requirement Does Resolution Require Financial Resources?

Here are a few of the resolutions that were adopted and what they mean. INCREASING PATIENT ACCESS TO SEXUAL ASSAULT NURSE EXAMIN ERS (H - 80.999) Hospital emergency departments are frequently the initial point of care for survivors of sexual assault. However, Emergency Medicine physicians, strapped for time in a busy ED, often struggle to provide compassionate and diligent examination s to victims of assault. This new policy advocates for greater access to sexual assault nurse examiners and other well -trained, qualified clinicians in performing these examinations on post -pubertal patients in emergency departments. In an AMA press releas e, Dr. Scott Ferguson, a member of the AMA Board of Trustees, stated: \"Having greater access to sexual assault nurse examiners, along with other trained and qualified clinicians, to perform medical forensic examinations will help increase timely access to care for patients.\" HIV, SEXUAL ASSAULT, AND VIOLENCE (H -20.900) In a similar vein, another pressing need for sexual assault survivors is testing and preventive measures for HIV infection. The AMA's new policy calls for HIV testing and Post - Exposure Proph ylaxis (PEP) to be offered to all survivors of sexual assault who present within 72 hours of a substantial exposure risk to a clinic. The policy continues with goals for public education on PEP, an antiretroviral medication shown to be effective in prevent ing infection after HIV exposure only if taken within 72 hours. INCREASED ACCESS TO IDENTIFICATION CARDS FOR THE HOMELESS POPULATION (H -160.894) When it comes to seeking healthcare, housing, or employment, identification can tend to be a major barrier for people experiencing homelessness. This year, delegates approved a resolution recognizing this problem and promoting systemic changes to address it. Eliminating roadblocks for Medicaid access could make a major impact on the health of those experiencing homelessness, 36 percent of whom suffer from a severe mental illness or chronic substance abuse. Dr. Scott Ferguson, a member of the AMA Board of Trustees, stated in an AMA press release: \"The AMA has long prioritized access to care as key to improving the h ealth of the nation, and, by today's action, we make very clear that more should be done to ensure that a lack of photo ID does not keep our fellow Americans from seeing a doctor.\" EQUALITY FOR COMLEX AND USMLE (H -275.953) With the 2014 merger of MD and DO accreditation systems, programs around the nation have been moving towards more unified processes for residency matching. Encouraging residency directors to give equal consideration to COMLEX and USMLE scores is another step towards 2020, when all resid ency programs in the US will be accredited by the unified ACGME. This new policy aligns the AMA more strongly with this upcoming change, promoting equal acceptance of test scores in light of unified accreditation. VIOLENCE PREVENTION (BOT 11) The public health crisis of gun violence continues to take its toll on communities across the country. In attempts to proffer meaningful solutions, several resolutions passed at Interim 2018, including one from the MSS section, were combined and reviewed by the Board of Trustees. The AMA already has substantial policy on the issues surrounding gun safety, and this BOT action clarifies and adds to that set of positions. The AMA now supports \"gun violence restraining orders\" as well as extreme risk protection orders kno wn as \"red -flag\" laws, the enactment of Child Access Prevention laws, and has expanded definitions in existing policy to include 3D printed weapons and blueprints.

At assembly at A -18 there 37 extractions from the RefCom r eport of 60 resolutions. One issue I have heard from many authors in my region is that they don't fully understand how RefCom makes its decisions, especially when it makes a recommendation that is opposite all the testimony given on VRC, so they extract ho ping for a more favorable view in assembly. Other authors are frustrated that staff gives recommendations to RefCom but not to authors, so they end up blindsided by the report. There needs to be a review done of how RefCom produces its reports with transpa rency for authors. The consequence has been that we are extracting more than half the resolutions every meeting, and people are wordsmithing on the floor to try to get their policy through, ultimately defeating the goal of RefCom which is to ensure that so und policy is produced by the MSS with time and consideration given to every word Action Requested review how RefCom generates its reports, and provide a report to the AMA -MSS assembly provide new strategies for ensuring that assembly moves efficiently whi le For the best user experience, please download a copy of this handbook to your personal device producing the best possible policy we can ____________________________________________________________________________ (2) Region Authorship Review Submitted by Anonymous on January 18, 2019 Short Summary of the Problem/Issue Every region seems to do someth ing differently to decide region authorship, and then with what to do after deciding to author. The mission of region authorship seems to have been lost, as it now is more of an endorsement and does not seem to carry much more than a few extra points in sc oring as the reference committee and the assembly do not seem concerned with region authorship. It is a time consuming process for authors and regions to apply for and vote on region authorship, and the intent of the outcome is becoming less clear. Action Requested Review the AMA -MSS policy on region authorship, including the mission and execution of region authorship, and provide a report to the assembly of whether region authorship is meeting the goals it intended to, as well as if it is an efficient use of time for authors and region members ____________________________________________________________________________ (3) Diversity in medicine and pipeline programs Submitted by Damani McIntosh -Clarke on February 17, 2019 Short Summary of the Problem/Issue In our healthcare landscape, disparities exist among socio -economic, racial and ethnic demographics, leading to disproportionate levels of adverse outcomes in these groups. The AMA has committed to reducing healthcare disparities through a variety of strategi es, including diversifying the physician workforce to reflect the communities they serve. One strategy that the AMA has endorsed to improve socio -economic and ethnic diversity in the physician workforce is advocating for pipeline programs that seek to achieve this goal. Action Requested Ask the AMA Board of Trustees or other relevant stakeholders to report on the actions taken by the AMA to advocate for pipeline programs and other initiatives to improve physician diversity and outcome data of these actions if available -- it would be especially useful to focus on actions taken since the \"Commission to End Healthcare Disparities Five -Year Summary\" published in 2009.

In 2016, the Final Rule of the Affordable Care Act redefined several elements of language access required in a m edical setting. Language access services including interpreters (live or video) for oral communication, and written translation of \"vital documents\" must be provided to LEP patients, at no cost to patients. It is noteworthy that \"vital documents\" is left i ntentionally vague; several hospital systems include discharge instructions within their list of documents considered \"vital documents\", while others do not. While it is progress that the law today in the United States specifies so much around language acc ess, the funding remains challenging. Hospitals and health systems are expected to internally fund the cost of language access services, and are able to decide what does and does not fit the description of \"vital documents\". In balancing inadequate funding and ambiguous translation requirements, many health systems are unable to afford translation of patient -specific written information for LEP patients, and end up omitting this from their institutional list of \"vital documents\". A small portion of the cost of language access services is offset by \"matching funds\" payments from Medicaid and CHIP. This is important; however, reimbursements do not fully cover the cost of language access resources for patients receiving services through Medicaid and CHIP, and d oes not address the significant volume of LEP patients who do not qualify for either of these programs. Expanding federal funding to help health systems pay for the cost of language access for LEP patients regardless of insurance status could have a signif icant impact on the abilities of hospitals and clinics to provide linguistically and culturally competent care. Supporting the efforts of health systems administrators and medical professionals in delivering language access at all stages of care in the hos pital, including throughout the critical discharge process, is in within the spirit of the Affordable Care Act, and addresses a disparity in health care justice. How may we raise awareness among medical trainees as well as call on our elected representativ es to mobilize resources at a national level to support our health systems as they reach toward a shared goal of delivering better care to all of our patients.

The 5 RTF was asked to address concerns about the functi onality and capacity of the existing 6 process, including: 7 8 A.Insufficient time for adequate discussion of resolutions in the Assembly 9 B.Impact on student leadership (including sectional and regional delegates as well as the 10 MSS House of Delegates Coordinating C ommittee) 11 C.Impact on AMA staff (including MSS staff and non -MSS experts) 12 D.Number of external resolutions forwarded to House of Delegates (HOD) 13 14 The RTF produced MSS RTF Report 1-A- 18, containing 24 resolution process reform 15 recommendations to encourage mentorship within the MSS, protect the democratic opportunity 16 to be heard, foster high -quality discussion in the MSS Assembly, and preserve resources for the 17 advocacy of MSS -originated resolutions in the AMA HOD. The GC amended these 18 recommendations in MSS GC Report A -A-18 and proposed a pilot year where implementation 19 would begin during the next cycle of the resolution process, I- 18, followed by a GC Report to the 20 Assembly at the 2019 Annual Meeting. The MSS Assembly adopted GC Report A-A- 18 with the 21 exception of Recommendation 8(b). 22 23 STATUS OF THE PILOT IMPLEMENTATION FOR A- 19 24 25 The GC has implemented all but two of the GC Report A -A-18 recommendations over the 26 course of the pilot year.

This volume of business raised concerns about the functionality and capacity of the current resolution process, prompting the MSS Governing Council (GC) to convene a MSS Resolution Process Task Force (RTF) to make recommendations on improvements to strengthen the current resolution process. In particular, the GC asked for recommendations that would address concerns about: a.Insufficient time for adequate discussion of resolutions in the Assembly b.Impact on student leadership (incl. sectional and regional delegates as well as the House Coordinating Committee) c. Impact on AMA staff (incl. MSS staff and non-MSS experts) d.Number of external resolutions forwarded to House of Delegates 1 This report presents recommendations for resolution process reforms that the RTF believes will encourage mentorship within the MSS, protect the democratic opportunity to be heard, foster high-quality discussion in the MSS Assembly, and preserve resources for the advocacy of MSS- originated resolutions in the AMA House of Delegates (HOD). This report also presents the results of an investigation of the current resolution process and its origins through interviews with various stakeholders. RESOLUTION TASK FORCE PROCEDURE After approving the charter convening the RTF, the MSS GC reached out to Region Governing Council Chairs and Vice Chairs to request nominations for two representatives to represent each Region. Previous efforts to reform the resolution process have met with limited success due to a lack of adequate engagement across the full MSS, and thus the GC prioritized equal representation from all regions on the RTF. In addition to two representatives from each Region, the RTF membership also included the MSS Section Delegates to provide input based on their expertise in the resolution process and as GC representatives. The MSS Councilor on Constitution and Bylaws was included to ensure that any discussed recommendations were not in conflict with the AMA Bylaws and to advise on which recommendations may require changes to the MSS Internal Operating Procedures. The region representatives, MSS Section Delegates, and the MSS Councilor on Constitution and 1 The full charter convening the RTF can be viewed in Appendix A. 2 Bylaws comprised the voting members of the RTF. The MSS Speakers were included as permanent, non-voting guests, and various other student leaders and AMA staff were invited as guests when pertinent. The RTF was led by the MSS Chair and the Student Member of the AMA Board of Trustees. The final membership for the RTF appears below: Role Member Task Force Co - Region 1 Alternate: Danny Hintze Region 2 Representative: Lauren Engel Region 2 Alternate: Blake Murphy Region 3 Representative: Luis Seija Region 3 Alternate: William Ross Region 4 Representative: Taylor Lucas Region 4 Alternate: Jessica Walsh O'Sullivan Region 5 Representative: Joshua Donkin Region 5 Alternate: Michelle Knopp Region 6 Representative: James Ting Region 6 Alternate: Pauline Huynh Region 7 Representative: Kate Topalis Region 7 Alternate: Breyen Task E Cox III, JD, Director, Division of Legislative Counsel William Estes, Government Relations Advocacy Fellow Christopher Cliffo rd, Council on Legislation Ryan Ribeira, MD, MPH, MSS Delegate 2011 -2012 Cameron Paterson, MD, MSS Delegate 2015 -2016 Sarah Mae Smith, MSS Delegate 2016 -2017 The RTF held four conference calls over a two-month period. The first and second calls were information-gathering meetings on the current and past resolution process. RTF members and other stakeholders submitted proposals to reform the resolution process between the second and third conference calls. On the third call, the RTF first established criteria they believed were reflective of a resolution process worth striving toward. The criteria below were established by a two-third majority vote of the RTF. Improves the quality of resolutions Establishes clear standards Minimizes reviewer bias Fosters mentorship Creates or furthers opportunities for discussion during the Assembly Ensures democratic opportunity 3 Improves efficient resource utilization Feasible effort necessary for implementation The RTF went on to discuss how the submitted proposals addressed each of these criteria, with the understanding that no proposal would fulfill all the criteria and that a set of proposals would have to be recommended to fulfill all the criteria. This discussion continued through the fourth conference call, and the RTF voted on which proposals should be recommended as resolution process reforms. Recommendations were established by a two-third majority vote of the RTF. RESOLUTION PROCESS BACKGROUND The first purpose of the AM A MSS is to provide \"meaningful input into the decision and policy - making process of the AMA.\"2 The MSS achieves this purpose in part by participating in the AMA HOD through the submission of MSS-authored resolutions. To be considered by the HOD, MSS-authored resolutions must first be submitted to the MSS Assembly by MSS member(s). The purpose of the MSS Assembly is \"to adopt resolutions for MSS Policy and for submission to the House of Delegates of the AMA.\"3 The MSS Internal Operating Procedures guarantee that any MSS member may submit resolutions for consideration.4 If the resolution secures a simple majority vote for adoption by the Assembly, it can be incorporated into the MSS Digest of Policy Actions or forwarded for consideration by the AMA HOD as an MSS-authored resolution.5 Resolution Process This report defines the \"resolution process\" as the stepwise process that begins with idea submission to the MSS Open Forum and ends with advocacy for the resolution by the MSS Caucus at the HOD. The resolution process encompasses the several months of preparation leading up to the MSS Assembly , duration of the Assembly, and several months of preparation leading up to the following HOD . Figure 1 provides a visual breakdown of the steps in the resolution process and responsibilities of each party involved. Each step is driven by a submission by the resolution author, which triggers multiple levels of feedback - and in later steps, assessment - from other medical students and AMA staff. Step 1: Open Forum The purpose of the MSS Open Forum is to provide a venue for potential resolution authors to share their ideas, receive early feedback, and connect with interested students and potential co- authors. Various levels of MSS leadership provide feedback at this step, notably the Section Delegates and the House Coordinating Committee. The author is responsible for incorporating feedback from the Open Forum as they draft their resolution. Step 2: Draft Submission Approximately 10 weeks prior to the MSS Assembly, the author submits a draft resolution, which spurs another round of feedback from various levels of MSS leadership. This round of feedback is organized by the Section Delegates so that each resolution receives adequate attention. The purpose of this feedback is to tailor high-quality final resolutions for consideration by the MSS Assembly. Step 3: Final Submission After incorporating feedback from their draft resolutions, authors submit a final resolution which 2 AMA MSS Internal Operating Procedures II.A. 3 AMA MSS Internal Operating Procedures X.D.5. 4 AMA MSS Internal Operating Procedures X.H.1. 5 AMA MSS Internal Operating Procedures X.H.8. 4 prompts a round of scoring and internal staff feedback. The Section Delegates assign the resolutions so that each resolution is scored against the resolution scoring rubric by six Regional Delegates and one House Coordinating Committee ( HCC) member.6 The scores are averaged and used to create an order of consideration that will be used during the Assembly . Concurrently, MSS staff refers almost all resolutions for relevant expert input by other staff within the AMA, including federal and state advocacy staff and legal review . MSS staff notes that it takes fewer resources to review internal resolutions than external resolutions. The resulting staff input is compiled into the Reference Committee background book, and also informs the calculation of the fiscal note (the estimated cost of implementing the Resolved clauses of the resolution). Step 4: Virtual Reference Committee The MSS is the only section within the AMA that uses a fully virtual Reference Committee (VRC). The role of the Reference Committee is to recommend an action on each resolution that will be placed before the Assembly, drawing on member testimony, staff background, and committee member expertise and research. Through the VRC process, all testimony that would have been provided before an in-person Reference Committee is instead provided through MSS online forums. After the VRC closes, the Reference Committee meets via conference call to deliberate and render its recommendation for each resolution. These recommendations are compiled into the Reference Committee Report. Step 5: Assembly The Reference Committee Report comprises the main motions that establish the business of the MSS Assembly. The Assembly is presided over by the MSS Speaker and Vice Speaker and guided by parliamentary procedure . During the Assembly, MSS members have an opportunity to debate each resolution. There are also multiple opportunities throughout the meeting for authors to engage with other students and build support for their resolutions, such as during Region Policy Meetings. If the Assembly votes to adopt a resolution, the Resolved clauses are either incorporated into the MSS Digest of Policy Actions (\"internal resolutions\") or forwarded to the HOD as an MSS- authored resolution (\"external resolutions\"). Step 6: HOD External resolutions that have been adopted by the MSS Assembly are generally sent to the HOD at the subsequent AMA meeting - for example, external resolutions adopted at Annual will be business of the HOD at Interim. Prior to and throughout the HOD meeting, the Section Delegates, Regional Delegates, student members of State Delegations, and HCC strategize on how to best support MSS-authored resolutions to improve their chances of adoption by the HOD. The author is encouraged to remain involved with their resolution throughout this time and may have an opportunity to provide in-person testimony before a HOD Reference Committee or the HOD. 6 The Annual 2018 Resolution Scoring Rubric can be viewed in Appendix B . 5 Figure 1.

Compile recommendations in the Reference Committee Report. Testify on Reference Committee recommendations when appropriate MSS Assembly Post testimony Vote on resolution adoption 7 Challenges in the Current Resolution Process The RTF conducted interviews with MSS staff, advocacy staff, and current and past Section Delegates. From these conversations, the following challenges were continually cited in the resolution process. Step Challenges Open Forum Large volume of ideas on the Open Forum makes providing timely feedback on all ideas challenging. Draft Submission Not all Regional Delegates provide timely feedback. Secondary reviews are sometimes inadequate. Due to rules about Regional Delegate review, differences in the number of resolutions submitted by each Region results in inequality in the number of resolutions each Regional Delegate is required to review. Final Submission Not all Regional Delegates score resolutions on time. Difficult to get staff -generated comments to authors in a timely manner. Higher volumes limit the quality of staff review that can be conducted on each resolution. Staff review occurs con currently with other staff responsibilities, such as preparing for HOD and federal advocacy responsibilities. Turnaround on review - student and staff - is short, usually around one week. Due to rules about Regional Delegate review, differences in the numb er of resolutions submitted by each Region results in inequality in the number of resolutions each Regional Delegate is required to review. VRC Posting testimony occurs right before VRC closes, diminishing the quality of debate that can be conducted. Assembly Higher volumes limit the amount of time that can be spent debating each resolution, constraining discussion and lowering the quality of debate. HOD Increased volume makes allocation of MSS representatives and MSS political capital difficult. Difficult to contact all relevant sections and specialty societies to ensure support for each external resolution. Not all Regional Delegates provide timely review on resolutions. Non-Resolution Avenues for Advocacy While authoring resolutions is an important avenue through which the MSS fulfills its purpose to impact AMA policy, there is a number of other avenues that will achieve the same purpose and are in some cases more appropriate courses of action for certain issues. The GC has been actively promoting awareness of these avenues.7 A sample of alternative avenues is listed below. 7 For example, alternative avenues are listed in the Resolution Guide, which is displayed in Appendix C . 8 GC Action Item Request: Students can submit a request for issues that can be resolved by action on the part of the GC. Action through state and county medical societies: Students can work through local organized medicine bodies for issues that are specific to one setting. Action through specialty medical societies: Students can work through specialty medical societies for issues that are specific to one specialty. Action through MSS Standing Committees: Students can collaborate with MSS Standing Committees to produce materials, programming, and other deliverables on issues already addressed within AMA and/or MSS policy. PROPOSALS CONSIDERED BY THE RESOLUTION PROCESS TASK FORCE The proposals considered by the RTF were divided into six stages corresponding to the steps of the resolution process or time between steps in the resolution process: 1. Education and Infrastructure: This stage occurs prior to the resolution process, and involves providing educational resources and initiatives to prepare MSS members to go through the resolution process. 2. Brainstorming Stage: This stage overlaps with the Open Forum up through draft resolution submission. Proposals in this stage focus on getting earlier feedback to students. 3. Revision Stage: This stage covers the time after draft resolution submission and before final resolution submission. Proposals in this stage consider ways to make resolution feedback more accessible to authors and other MSS leadership and ways to increase cross-regional collaboration. 4. Scoring Stage: This stage assesses the scoring rubric used by Regional Delegates and HCC during the resolution scoring step. 5. VRC/Reference Committee Stage: This stage overlaps with the opening of the VRC and the creation of the Reference Committee report. Proposals in this stage focus on making information more accessible to the Reference Committee and MSS members and increasing engagement in the VRC. 6. Assembly Stage: This stage overlaps with the duration of the MSS Assembly. Proposals in this stage aim to protect the ability of the Assembly to have high-quality debate. A total of 49 proposals were considered.8 As described in the RTF Procedure, each proposal was discussed twice by the RTF before recommendation for resolution process reform was determined by a two-thirds majority vote. The following is a summary of the RTF discussion on each proposal. 8 A listing of all proposals divided by stage can be viewed in Appendix D. 9 A. Education and Infrastructure 1. Train RD/ADs to provide better guidance on the various mechanisms available for advocacy through the AMA and MSS. 2. Create a formal document and/or talking points to provide to members as proof of significant, non-resolution related work (i.e. serving as a Delegate, in leadership, on a committee, etc.) which they can provide as support for conference funding and time-off requests. 3. Make a video explaining the basics of Parliamentary Procedure and the most common mistakes people make. 4. Create a PolicyFinder for AMA-MSS policy to replace the current PDF. 5. Publicize GC Action Item Requests widely and increase the prestige of these proposals. For example, requesters can present GC Action Item Requests during a programming session. 6. Define an individual on each Region GC whose can be contacted by other Regions to collaborate during the resolution process. Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion A1 Improves the quality of resolutions; Fosters mentorship; Improves efficient resource utilization Recommend The other mechanisms available for advocacy include the alternative avenues addressed previously (e.g. GC action item request) and are also covered in the Resolution Alternatives published on the AMA website.9 A2 Fosters mentorship; Improves efficient resource utilization Recommend This proposal is for a general document that would be similar to the form letter the RFS provides to its members. The document would describe the purpose of the meeting and justify why students should be able to attend and receive funding. The GC began providing template letters for people who are serving in leadership roles to validate their importance to the Assembly. There may be value in a further individualized document. A3 Creates or furth ers opportunities for discussion during the Assembly ; Ensures democratic opportunity Recommend The RTF acknowledged the potential implementation burden for staff associated with creating a video; however, RTF members noted that there are students with the requisite skills who would be willing to contribute. Explanatory videos for topics aside from parliamentary procedure may also be useful. A4 Improves the quality of resolutions; Improves efficient resource utilization Do not recommend There was debate in the RTF on whether a PolicyFinder would be more or less accessible than the current PDF Digest of Policy Actions. It was suggested that both remain available if this proposal was recommended. There were also concerns that a PolicyFinder would create confusion as to what is MSS policy and what is AMA policy. The creation of a MSS PolicyFinder might also lead to other sections with internal policy (the RFS and YPS) asking for a similar tool. The amount of implementation effort required for this proposal was uncertain. A5 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Improves efficient resource utilization Recommend The RTF generally supported this proposal. There were some concerns about whether this proposal would create a large volume of GC Action Items. A6 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Do not recommend This proposal arose from difficulties in finding the correct person to coordinate cross - regional efforts. However, several region representatives noted that regions have 9 The Resolution Alternatives can be viewed in Appendix E. 10 Fosters mentorship unique structures and should be free to make their own designations. The feasibility of implementing such a proposal was also questioned. B. Brainstorming Stage (Pre-Draft Submission) 1. Have a MSS leader analyze the Open Forum for resolutions that the AMA Federal Advocacy Office would be interested in reviewing. The MSS leader will give a preliminary ranking and recommendation to each idea (similar to HCC). They will then forward the list and assessments on to the GRAF, who will determine which ones elevate to the level of staff input. a. MSS leader could be the student COL member or the Section Delegates and Region Delegation Chairs. 2. Have the GRAF monitor the Legislation and Advocacy subfolder on the Open Forum. 3. Have students submit resolution ideas to Regional leadership (e.g. the policy chair), who will then post the idea to the proper Open Forum category. 4. Have an indicator on the Open Forum that shows if the originator is a first-time author. This visibility would allow more experienced writers to help the new authors and mentor them through the process. Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion B1 Improves the quality of resolutions; Improves efficient resource utilization; Feasible effort necessary for implementation Recommend The RTF appreciated that this proposal provided earlier feedback to potential authors of advocacy resolutions while streamlining the process of advocacy staff review. Since there are many entries in the Open Forum, the RTF agreed that multiple student leaders shou ld split the responsibility, and specifically named the GRAF, MSS Councilor on Legislation, Section Delegates, and Region Delegation Chairs. B2 This proposal was combined with B1 above. B3 Do not recommend The RTF felt that allowing potential authors to categorize their own submissions to the Open Forum provided information on how potential authors saw their own ideas and served as a valuable learning experience. B4 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Fosters mentorship; Improves efficient resource utilization Recommend The RTF supported this proposal and likened it to the first -time attendee stickers that are used at meetings. However, the RTF had questions about how this proposal would be implemented and wondered if staff could set up a visible indicator could be set up on the Open Forum. 11 C. Revision Stage (Post-Draft Submission, Pre-Final Submission) 1. Emphasize feedback on resolutions that do not receive State or Regional support, e.g. ask Regions to submit formal reasoning behind why they chose NOT to support a policy, or having additional reviewers on single-author resolutions. 2. Broaden the functional scope of the HCC so HCC members can contact Region leaders to improve resolutions that would otherwise likely be reaffirmed. 3. Make HCC review summaries easily available in a compiled report. 4. Primary reviewers must send feedback summary emails to the primary author's Region Chair and Region Delegation Chair in order to allow Regions to incorporate draft feedback into their Region authorship voting if they choose to. 5. All external resolutions are required to have Region authorship. a. Addendum: Regions are capped at supporting 5 external resolutions written primarily by their own members. 6. All external resolutions must have cross-regional authorship. 7. All external resolution authors must contact the relevant specialty society prior to submission. 8. All resolutions must have cross-regional authorship. 9. Coordinate Region resolution authorship/support through a central AMA email process so more medical school sections can be reached. 10. All members of the MSS Caucus (RDs/ADs + state ADs) vote on whether they believe the resolution should be considered at the Assembly, and only resolutions above some threshold are allowed to advance to the final resolution phase 11. Upon submission of a final draft, having authors of external resolutions virtually sign an acknowledgement saying that they understand that, if passed, that their resolution will be forwarded to the AMA HOD at the subsequent meeting and that they will help the Section Delegates and MSS RD/ADs in bringing their resolution to the AMA HOD. This would include but not be limited to updating whereas clauses for the next meeting with the most up to date literature, crafting testimony for the VRC and live Reference Committee hearings, and reaching out to specialty societies. Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion C1 Improves the quality of resolutions Do not recommend The RTF noted that each Region uses different standards to determine whether to provide support for resolutions, thus passing this proposal may not be equitable across Regions. In addition, the proposal was deemed to be unduly harsh for newer resolution authors. C2 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Fosters mentorship; Improves efficient resource utilization Recommend This proposal intends to provide HCC with the additional ability to email Region leadership, adding on to the existing process where they leave feedback on the draft resolutions directly. It should be noted that \"im provement\" includes encouraging mergers between similar resolutions and the elimination of resolution topics that duplicate existing policy. Giving HCC the ability to contact Region leadership about resolutions that may be recommended against adoption was discussed, but rejected as outside the purview of HCC. Several members of the RTF also noted that it would be helpful for Region members to know who the HCC members were in each Region, in order to facilitate two -way communication. C3 Improves the quality of resolutions Do not recommend This proposal arose from a desire to make HCC feedback more readily available to all members. However, the RTF was unable to come to consensus on which stage the HCC feedback should be collated at, and what additional valu e it would provide since HCC posts its feedback on the VRC and therefore HCC feedback is already incorporated in the Reference Committee Report when relevant. C4 Improves the quality of Recommend This proposal arose from the desire to provide Region leadership with more 12 Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion resolutions ; Fosters mentorship; Improves efficient resource utilization information when they are determining which resolutions to provide Region authorship to. The process for determining Region authorship varies between Regions, so the Region Chair and Region Delegation Chair should forward the primary reviewer feedback to the appropriate body. C5 Do not recommend This proposal was dismissed as another form of a cap on the number of resolutions. It was also noted that the differ ence in Region authorship determination between Regions could set the bar higher in some Regions than others, potentially stifling good work. C6 Do not recommend The proposal received the same criticisms as C5, with the additional comment that it is more restrictive on new potential authors. C7 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Fosters mentorship Recommend This proposal codifies an existing process. C8 Do not recommend This proposal received the same criticisms as C5 and C6. C9 Recommend While the RTF supported this proposal, there was discussion on how it would be implemented without invading member privacy. The new Region newsletter initiative was cited. The RTF notes that GC would have to give more thought to the feasible implementation of this proposal. C10 Do not recommend The RTF commented that this proposal might introduce more bias into the resolution process, and rejected it for that reason . C11 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Establishes clear standards; Fosters mentorship Recommend The RTF noted that this proposal is a formalization of existing practice. They agreed that the document should be clear that once an external resolution has become business of the HOD, the MSS Caucus takes ownership and has the final authority to direct what strategy and action should be taken on the resolution. 13 D. Scoring Stage 1. Resolutions should be scored based on authorship (section, state, region). 2. Resolutions should be scored based on clarity. 3. Resolutions should be scored based on research quality. 4. Resolutions should be scored based on scope. 5. Resolutions should be scored based on feasibility. 6. Resolutions should be scored based on novelty. 7. Resolutions should be scored based on how well they address AMA Strategic Focus Areas. 8. Resolutions should be scored based on how well they address MSS Policy Objectives. a. The Section Delegates should be responsible for conducting an annual survey which sets the MSS Policy Objectives for the given year. b. A resolution's score of how well it addresses MS S Policy Objectives should make up a larger proportion of the overall score (currently 10%). 9. Resolutions should be scored based on whether they responded to feedback. 10. Resolutions should be scored on a quantitative scale. 11. Resolutions should be scored with consideration of their fiscal note. Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion D1 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Establishes clear standards ; Fosters mentorship Recommend There was discussion about whether inter -region variance in determining Regional authorship makes this a less reliable metric, but in general the RTF agreed that it makes sense to give weight to the resolutions that are important to a larger proportion of the electorate. The process of gaining local or regional authorship is also a good learning experience for building coalitions at HOD. D2 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Establishes clear standards Recommend The RTF discussed whether clarity should have been ensured earlier in the feedback process, but agreed that this metric constituted an important final filter as well as a useful indicator when the resolution rubric is used to provide a draft score to the authors. D3 Improves the quality of resol utions ; Establishes clear standards ; Creates or furthers opportunities for discussion during the Assembly Recommend There was limited discussion on whether the weight of this metric was too high. D4 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Establishes clear standards Recommend Some members of the RTF noted that \"scope\" is a very subjective metric. However, the RTF still found this metric useful. D5 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Establishes clear standards ; Creates or furthers opportunities for discuss ion during the Assembly Recommend The RTF believes that scope and feasibility are two separate categories and should be listed as such on the resolution rubric. Feasibility includes the fiscal note to some extent. 14 Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion D6 Improves the quality of resolutions Recommend The RTF noted that this was one of the most useful criteria. D7 Do not recommend The RTF does not believe that a resolution has to correspond with the AMA Strategic Focus Areas to qualify as a high -quality resolution, and would recommend its removal from the resolution rubric. Awareness of the AMA Strategic Focus Areas can be incorporated in the educational process for resolution writing. D8 Recommend The RTF made the differentiation between alignment with the AMA Strategic Focus Areas and the MSS Policy Objectives as follows: since the MSS is an independent section within the AMA, the MSS Policy Objectives allow the MSS to set a unified policy directio n that it can affect within the broader AMA compendium. Narrower policy objectives that are nimble enough to change on an annual basis can help the MSS present a coherent, united, and continuous advocacy effort in the HOD. The RTF discussed the significant implementation effort associated with part (a) of this proposal (conducting an annual survey), and noted that an in -person survey would be more effective. The RTF rejected part (b) of this proposal, opting not to recommend an increase to the proportion of the overall score. D9 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Establishes clear standards Recommend The RTF noted that \"responded to feedback\" should be interpreted as \"thoughtful response\". D10 Recommend The RTF was not fully comfortable with a quantitative scale, but given the fact that it is only used to order resolutions for consideration, they could not determine a better metric. D11 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Establishes clear standards; Minimizes reviewer bias Do not recommend The RTF did not find a significant association between the quality of a resolution and its fiscal note. They noted that it may be more necessary to discuss items with high fiscal notes earlier in the Assembly , which would not happen if resolutions were penalized for a high fiscal note. 15 E. VRC/Reference Committee Stage 1. Create a new Reference Committee recommendation category named \"recommend for GC action item.\" 2. Adjust resolution deadlines to allow more time for review between the final submission and VRC. 3. Release the list of final resolutions prior to VRC opening so that regions and states will have more time to organize their resolution review processes. 4. Have HCC post a summary of their comments from the draft review process to the VRC. 5. After final resolutions are submitted, the HOD Coordination Committee (HCC) will review all submissions and place items on a Reaffirmation Consent Calendar based on simple majority voting within the Committee. The selected items will not receive detailed staff review except analysis from Legal Counsel . The selected items will be displayed on the Virtual Reference Committee as \"Reaffirmation Consent Calendar\" separate from the Resolutions folder and Reports folder. The Reaffirmation Consent Calendar will be open for comments on the VRC but will not be business of the MSS Assembly unless extracted during the MSS Assembly Opening Session. 6. Have RD/ADs provide meaningful testimony on the VRC for resolutions they reviewed, especially in cases where important recommendations were not considered. 7. Conduct debate on lower scoring resolutions in a live forum where people can vote ahead of the Assembly. The vote can eliminate resolutions before the Assembly. Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion E1 Fosters mentorship ; Ensures democratic opportunity ; Improves efficient resource utilization Recommend This proposal arose from a desire to enable the Reference Committee to recommend further action on a resolution that duplicates existing policy but calls for further action . The RTF supported the idea but noted there would have to be clarifications in the parliamentary procedure implementation. The hope is that implementing this proposal lessens the number of extractions from the reaffirmation calendar and consequent wordsmi thing on the floor. E2 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Fosters mentorship Recommend This proposal is aimed at giving all members, but especially those who need to provide testimony, more time to review final resolutions. E3 Improves the quality of resolutions Do not recommend This proposal had a similar aim to E2, but discussion of its implementation revealed that there is no way to publicly release the list of final resolutions earlier due to time needed for staff review. Therefore the RTF did not recommend this. E4 Fosters mentorship Recommend It was noted that this proposal should not apply if authors replied to HCC draft feedback. E5 Improves the quality of resolutions ; Creates or furthers opportunities for discussion during the Assembly Recommend This proposal brings MSS procedure in line with HOD procedure, and lessens the volume of staff review needed. There was concern that this proposal may violate democratic opportunity, which would have to be rectified by running a transparent and e ducated process. The RTF also noted that a corresponding process for reaffirmation calendar extraction and subsequent Reference Committee review would have to be drawn up. The RTF suggested amending this proposal to also allow HCC to make recommendations f or the new \"recommend for GC Action Item\" category, and to include medical student section delegates to help alleviate the burden of giving HCC multiple new roles. E6 Improves the quality of Recommend The RTF noted that posting on the VRC is up to the discretion of the individual 16 Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion resolutions ; Fosters mentorship; Creates or furthers opportuniti es for discussion during the Assembly Regional Delegate and this proposal should not apply if the authors adequately addressed draft feedback. E7 Do not recommend The RTF felt that this proposal decreased democratic opportunity too greatly. 17 F. Assembly Stage 1. Create the Assembly's Order of Business according to resolution scores. 2. Cap the number of resolutions for discussion at the Assembly. 3. Cap the number of resolution that can be forwarded to the HOD from each Assembly. 4. Designate specific microphones as PRO, CON, and repeat speaker microphones. 5. Provide a report after each Assembly meeting on the impact of the resolutions passed. 6. Establish a threshold vote required to extract a resolution. 7. Place a time limit on discussion for each resolution or on the amount of time each Delegate may speak at one time. 8. Separate Assembly time so that resolutions above a certain threshold receive more time for debate, with the remaining time divided between resolutions below the threshold. 9. Create a new, informational category of business for the Assembly that would be reviewed by Standing Committees. a. Addendum: Consider adding a separate session where the authors can present informational business. 10. Give delegates points that they can use at the end of the Assembly to prioritize external resolutions. Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion F1 Recommend This proposal was submitted as a referendum on existing practice. The RTF indicated interest in investigating other methods to order business, but felt the current order based on quantitative scoring was adequate. F2 Do not recommend Several members of the RTF voiced strong opposition to any sort of cap on the number of resolutions, citing infringement on democratic opportunity and the lack of an objective evaluation system which reliably correlates with quality of the resolution. F3 Do not recommend The discussion on this proposal mirrored F2 . F4 Creates or furthers opportunities for discussion during the Assembly ; Ensures democratic opportunity Do not recommend This proposal stems from practice in state assemblies and HOD Reference Committees. While the RTF and the Speakers saw value in the idea, the RTF was not sure that the proposal would bring value worth the implementation. F5 Recommend While the RTF supported the general principle of tracking the outcomes of resolutions important to the MSS, there was discussion that this proposal was not sufficiently defined and could take significant effort and time to implement. Therefore, there is ro om for the GC to discuss specific implementation. The RTF noted that it might be more effective to track just high -impact resolutions whose outcomes could be distributed for membership and recruiting. F6 Do not recommend There was no discussion in the RT F on this proposal. F7 Creates or furthers opportunities for discussion during the Assembly ; Ensures democratic opportunity Do not recommend The RTF noted that this is already within the purview of the Speakers and felt it best left to their discretion. F8 Recommend This proposal seeks to address the need to protect sufficient time at the Assembly to have thoughtful, high -quality debate on resolutions. With a large volume of 18 Proposal Criteria Fulfilled Recommendation Discussion resolutions, there is often a desire to speed through earlier items of business so that all resolutions can be discussed at the meeting. This proposal references the fact that the Assembly is under no obligation to complete all items of business on its docket. The RTF supported the idea of giving more time to debate resolutions, thoug h some noted that the scoring rubric which is used to order business does not always correspond with quality. There is room for GC discussion of implementation - for example, implementation of this proposal does not prevent moving on to the next item of bu siness if there is no further discussion, but it may prevent calling the question. F9 Recommend This proposal allows individuals to create materials on topics they are passionate about and collaborate with MSS Standing Committees. The RTF clarified that these informational items are presented to the MSS and the items are filed afterward in their own category. The RTF suggested that the presentations might be recorded and posted online after the meeting. F10 Do not recommend The RTF appreciated the aspec ts of this proposal which increased democratic opportunity in the sense that the prioritization originated from the Assembly. Some noted that this might be useful information for the Section Delegates, though it should not be binding. Others on the RTF arg ued that the Section Delegates have the responsibility to advocate for all resolutions equally. Therefore the RTF was divided and could not recommend this proposal. 19 CONCLUSION The RTF identified many challenges faced by authors, reviewers, and staff in the current resolution process, indicating that the resolution process needs to be reformed to ensure that it can continue to produce high-quality resolutions, engage members, foster mentorship, provide equal democratic opportunity, and provide sufficient resources to support external resolutions in the HOD. Throughout its consideration of 49 potential proposals for resolution process reform, the RTF gravitated toward proposals which furthered educational efforts, increased mentorship opportunities, elevated non-resolution avenues for advocacy, and widely distributed resolution feedback across many actors and mediums. The RTF also acknowledged that optimizing the resolution process requires balancing priorities, and therefore the RTF recommended proposals which would alleviate pain points within the process, such as the volume of staff review necessary and Assembly time spent on lower-value discussions such as wordsmithing. The RTF believes that implementation of its recommendations will result in a resolution process which is clearer, fairer, and more valuable for all MSS members. RECOMMENDATION The MSS Resolution Process Task Force recommends that the MSS Governing Council consider the following reforms to the resolution process and release a GC Report to the Assembly detailing a pilot implementation of the reforms, and that the remainder of the report be filed. 1. That the MSS invest in further education efforts on the resolution process by: a. Training RD/ADs to provide better guidance on the various mechanisms available for advocacy through the AMA and MSS. b. Making a video explaining the basics of Parliamentary Procedure and the most common mistakes made. 2. That the M SS elevate the stature of non-resolution avenues for advocacy by: a. Publicizing GC Action Item Requests widely and increase the prestige of these proposals. b. Creating a new, informational category of business for the Assembly that would be reviewed by Standing Committees, which could be presented in a separate programming session where the authors present informational business. c. Providing a formal document to its members as proof of significant, non- resolution-related work which they can provide as support for a conference funding and time-off request. Examples of significant, non-resolution-related work include serving as a Delegate or on a Committee. 3. That the MSS encourage mentorship between its members and throughout the AMA by: a. Creating an indicator on the Open Forum that shows if the originator is a first- time author. This visibility would allow more experienced writers to help the new authors and mentor them through the process. b. Requiring all external resolution authors to contact the relevant specialty society prior to submission. 4. That the MSS improve transparency of resolution feedback among all actors throughout the resolution process by: a. Requiring the GRAF, MSS Councilor on Legislation, Section Delegations, and Region Delegation Chairs to analyze the Open Forum for resolutions that the AMA Federal Advocacy Office would be interested in reviewing. b. Broadening the functional scope of the HCC so HCC members can contact Region leaders to improve resolutions that would otherwise likely be reaffirmed. 20 c. Requiring primary reviewers to send feedback summary emails to the primary author's Region Chair and Region Delegation Chair in order to allow Regions to incorporate draft feedback into their Region authorship voting if they choose to. d. Requesting that HCC post a summary of their comments from the draft review process to the VRC. e. Requesting that RD/ADs provide meaningful testimony on the VRC for resolutions they reviewed, especially in cases where important recommendations were not considered. 5. That the MSS streamline existing procedures in the resolution process by: a. Coordinating Region resolution authorship/support through a central AMA email process so more medical school sections can be reached. b. Giving the HOD Coordination Committee responsibility to review all submissions and place items on a Reaffirmation Consent Calendar. Items on the Reaffirmation Consent Calendar will not receive detailed staff review except analysis from Legal Counsel. c. Adjusting resolution deadlines to allow more time for review between the final submission and VRC. 6. That the MSS change its scoring rubric to: a. Reaffirm its existing rubric categories of authorship, clarity, research quality, scope, feasibility, novelty, addressing the MSS Policy Objectives, thoughtful response to feedback, and scoring on a quantitative scale. b. Eliminate the existing rubric category of addressing the AMA Strategic Focus Areas. c. Not include scoring of the fiscal note as a rubric category. 7. That the MSS reaffirm its existing process of creating the Assembly's Order of Business according to quantitative resolution scores. 8. That the MSS create and further opportunities for high-quality discussion in the Assembly by: a. Creating a new Reference Committee recommendation category named \"recommend for GC action item.\" b. Separating Assembly time so that resolutions above a certain threshold receive more time for debate, with the remaining time divided between resolutions below the threshold. 9. That the MSS improve continuity of its advocacy efforts from meeting to meeting by: a. Requiring authors of external resolutions to sign a virtual acknowledgement agreeing to help the Section Delegates and Regional Delegates in bringing their resolution to the AMA HOD, if their resolution is passed by the Assembly. b. Providing a report after each Assembly meeting on the impact of the resolutions passed. c. Giving the Section Delegates responsibility for conducting an annual survey which sets the MSS Policy Objectives for the given year. 21 Appendix A. MSS Resolution Process Task Force Charter MSS Resolution Process Task Force Background At the 2017 Interim Meeting of the AMA Medical Student Section (MSS), the Assembly received an unprecedented number of resolutions for discussion and evaluation. 194 ideas were posted on the Open Forum, 124 draft resolutions were submitted, and 95 final resolutions were accepted as business of the Assembly. During the Assembly Meeting, 35 resolutions were extracted from the reference committee calendar and 33 resolutions were discussed. At the conclusion of the meeting, 33 external resolutions were passed for forwarding to the House of Delegates, of which 2 were immediately forwarded and 31 will be forwarded at the 2018 Annual Meeting. The MSS Governing Council (GC) welcomes the increased interest in our MSS policy process and Assembly, and encourages students to submit resolutions advocating on issues which are important to them. However, several stakeholders have raised concerns about a possible upward trend in resolution submissions. These concerns include: 1. The number of resolutions submitted may exceed the capacity of the current system and place undue burden on AMA staff, the MSS Delegates, and members involved in the resolution process such as RDs, ADs, HCC, and standing committees. 2. The volume of resolutions accepted for business of the assembly may not allow delegates to adequately prepare for the Assembly, and it may not allow for substantive discussion during the Assembly due to the desire to discuss all items of business. 3. The current resolution process may not provide sufficient evaluation and mentorship of resolution ideas and drafts, leading to a high proportion of resolutions that are reaffirmed or not adopted. Task Force Charter The MSS GC recognizes the importance of finding an equitable and democratic solution to address these issues. As such, the MSS GC is forming an MSS Resolution Process Task Force with representation from all of our regions and stakeholders to assess the current process and to make recommendations to the MSS GC on potential improvements that may address the current concerns. Based on the Task Force's re commendations, the MSS GC will produce a GC report to the Assembly for the 2018 Annual Meeting proposing changes to the MSS policy process through amendments to the MSS Internal Operating Procedures. The charge to the MSS Resolution Process Task Force is to: 2. Assess the effectiveness of our current resolution process in achieving its goals, including: a. Producing high-quality resolutions worthy of discussion at our MSS Assembly b. Engaging our members with mentorship and discussion c. Providing an equal democratic opportunity to be heard d. Giving every external resolution passed by the Assembly sufficient resources to advocate for passage in the HOD 22 3. Collect and evaluate information on the impact of our current process on the various stakeholders in our process, including: a. MSS Assembly b. MSS Delegates c. MSS House Coordinating Committee and the MSS Caucus d. MSS staff e. AMA advocacy staff and policy experts f. The AMA House of Delegates g. AMA HOD specialty society delegations 4. Recommend actions and efforts that would have a meaningful positive impact on the major resolution process concerns: a. Insufficient time for adequate discussion of resolutions in the Assembly b. Impact on student leadership (incl. sectional and regional delegates as well as HCC) c. Impact on AMA staff (incl. MSS staff and non-MSS experts) d. Number of external resolutions forwarded to HOD 5. Report formal recommendations back to the MSS Governing Council no later than May 1, 2018. Task Force Composition The MSS Resolution Process Task Force shall have the following Lee, MSS Councilor on Constitution and Bylaws (Task Force secretary, voting) Jerome Jeevarajan, MSS Delegate (voting) Kieran McAvoy, MSS Alternate Delegate (non-voting alternate) Region 1 Representative (voting) Region 1 Alternate (non-voting alternate) Region 2 Representative (voting) Region 2 Alternate (non-voting alternate) Region 3 Representative (voting) Region 3 Alternate (non-voting alternate) Region 4 Representative (voting) Region 4 Alternate (non-voting alternate) Region 5 Representative (voting) Region 5 Alternate (non-voting alternate) Region 6 Representative (voting) Region 6 Alternate (non-voting alternate) Region 7 Representative (voting) Region 7 Alternate (non-voting alternate) Region representatives shall be appointed by Region Chairs with the advice of their Region Governing Council members. Regions are advised to appoint representatives with familiarity 23 with both the MSS resolution process and the AMA House of Delegates, such as former or current members of the MSS House Coordinating Committee or the MSS Caucus. In order to ensure adequate representation, absences from Task Force meetings shall be reported to region boards at the conclusion of every meeting, and region chairs may choose to replace members who are unable to attend. Meetings of the Task Force will be scheduled and facilitated by the non-voting co-chairs, who shall maintain impartiality in all Task Force proceedings. The MSS Speakers will also be invited as permanent guests in order to answer any questions regarding the Assembly process, but will not otherwise be participating members of the Task Force. The following is a non- exhaustive list of recommended AMA staff interviewees: Haley Guion, JD, Director, Medical Student Section Hannah Handal, Policy Analyst, Medical Student Section George Cox, JD, Director, Legislative Counsel William Estes, Government Relations Advocacy Fellow Task Force Meetings The Task Force is expected to meet five times via conference call to interview guests and facilitate discussion. The estimated duration of each meeting is two hours. In order to align with the requirements in the MSS Assembly for IOP changes, the final recommendations will require the approval of 2/3 of voting members to be forwarded to the MSS Governing Council. In the event that a voting member is not present, the member's designated alternate may vote in his or her place. The Task Force Secretary will, in consultation with the Co-Chairs, prepare minutes of every Task Force meeting, which will be published for MSS Assembly viewing after approval by the Task Force. In order to facilitate open discussion, minutes will be de-identified before release. Task Force meetings will be closed, but the Task Force shall have the power to invite guests and observers to one or more of its meetings at its discretion in order to provide required information. 24 Appendix B.

Authors must ensure that an MSS resolution is the best means of accomplishing their goals. The following are common examples of issues that are NOT best addressed through an MSS resolution: The resolution addresses an issue that could be resolved by the AMA- MSS Governing Council, specifically by submitting a GC Action Item request The resolution addresses a medical school-specific issue that would be more appropriately addressed by medical school faculty or administration The resolution addresses a specialty-specific issue that would be more appropriately addressed by the relevant medical specialty society The resolution addresses a state-specific issue that would be more appropriately addressed by a state medical society The resolution addresses an issue that is already sufficiently covered by existing AMA Policy or existing AMA-MSS Policy . 1. Resolutions that succeed in the MSS are well-researched and novel, and add value to the policy compendiums of the AMA or AMA-MSS. Authors must understand what has been attempted and accomplished in the past in order to produce strong resolutions for the future. Review the AMA Strategic Focus Areas and MSS Internal Policy Objectives to understand the priority issues for our organization (see scoring rubric below) Review existing AMA Policy and existing AMA-MSS Policy Review the Proceedings from past years' MSS meetings for examples of what policy proposals have and have not been successful in its Assembly Review past House Coordination Committee Executive Summaries of items in which the MSS had a vested interest and stance on in the House of Delegates Writing Your Resolution 1 Use the Resolution Template! (New for A-18!) 2 Follow the resolution formatting guide . 3 For external resolutions (those that call for the AMA to act, not the AMA-MSS), understand that the burden on the authors to do their due diligence in research, soliciting appropriate feedback and making appropriate contacts is more rigorous than for internal resolutions. Authors of external resolutions should ensure that their topic is appropriate for external submission and aligns with AMA's Strategic Focus Areas: d. Improving Health Outcomes e. Accelerating Change in Medical Education f. Enhancing Physician Satisfaction and Practice Sustainability by Shaping Delivery and Payment Models 32 3. For external resolutions, authors should be aware that if their item should pass, it will not be brought forward to the AMA House of Delegates until the following national meeting . However, authors must be prepared to complete the following: a. Work with the AMA-MSS Delegate and Alternate Delegate in advance of the following national meeting in order to help in the passage of their item, including submitting written testimony in support of the item 4. For external resolutions that call for immediate forwarding to the House of Delegates following the same MSS meeting at which they are passed authors must be aware that: a. Only in rare cases are resolutions forwarded immediately to the HOD b. There must be unusual circumstances deserving of immediate consideration by the HOD assembly c. The MSS Delegate and Alternate Delegate must be contacted regarding the author's intentions well in advance of the actual meeting d. Authors must submit written testimony to the MSS Delegate and Alternate Delegate for submission to the HOD e. Authors must attend the MSS caucus Saturday afternoon/evening in order to help with strategy for passage of their resolution. 5. Note about withdrawal of resolutions: a. All submitted final resolutions will become the business of the MSS Assembly on April 20th at 11:59 PM PST. Primary authors will have the opportunity to withdraw their resolutions if desired before this deadline. 33 Appendix D. Proposals Considered by the RTF, Organized by Stage A. Education and Infrastructure 1. Train RD/ADs to provide better guidance on the various mechanisms available for advocacy through the AMA and MSS. 2. Create a formal document and/or talking points to provide to members as proof of significant, non-resolution related work (i.e. serving as a Delegate, in leadership, on a committee, etc.) which they can provide as support for a conference funding and time-off request. 3. Make a video explaining the basics of Parliamentary Procedure and the most common mistakes people make. 4. Create a PolicyFinder for AMA-MSS policy to replace the current PDF. 5. Publicize GC Action Item Requests widely and increase the prestige of these proposals. For example, requesters can present GC Action Item Requests during a programming session. 6. Define an individual on each Region GC whose can be contacted by other Regions to collaborate during the resolution process. B. Brainstorming Stage (Pre-Draft Submission) 1. Have a MSS leader analyze the Open Forum for resolutions that the AMA Federal Advocacy Office would be interested in reviewing. The MSS leader will give a preliminary ranking and recommendation to each idea (similar to HCC). They will then forward the list and assessments on to the GRAF, who will determine which ones elevate to the level of staff input. a. MSS leader could be the student COL member or the Section Delegates and Region Delegation Chairs. 2. Have the GRAF monitor the Legislation and Advocacy subfolder on the Open Forum. 3. Have students submit resolution ideas to Regional leadership (e.g. the policy chair), who will then post the idea to the proper Open Forum category. 4. Have an indicator on the Open Forum that shows if the originator is a first-time author. This visibility would allow more experienced writers to help the new authors and mentor them through the process. C. Revision Stage (Post-Draft Submission, Pre-Final Submission) 1. Emphasize feedback on resolutions that do not receive State or Regional support, e.g. ask Regions to submit formal reasoning behind why they chose NOT to support a policy, or having additional reviewers on single-author resolutions. 2. Broaden the functional scope of the HCC so HCC members can contact Region leaders to improve resolutions that would otherwise likely be reaffirmed. 3. Make HCC review summaries easily available in a compiled report. 4. Primary reviewers must send feedback summary emails to the primary author's Region Chair and Region Delegation Chair in order to allow Regions to incorporate draft feedback into their Region authorship voting if they choose to. 5. All external resolutions are required to have Region authorship. a. Addendum: Regions are capped at supporting 5 external resolutions written primarily by their own members. 6. All external resolutions must have cross-regional authorship. 7. All external resolution authors must contact the relevant specialty society prior to submission. 8. All resolutions must have cross-regional authorship. 34 9. Coordinate Region resolution authorship/support through a central AMA email process so more medical school sections can be reached. 10. All members of the MSS Caucus (RDs/ADs + state ADs) vote on whether they believe the resolution should be considered at the Assembly, and only resolutions above some threshold are allowed to advance to the final resolution phase 11. Upon submission of a final draft, having authors of external resolutions virtually sign an acknowledgement saying that they understand that, if passed, that their resolution will be forwarded to the AMA HOD at the subsequent meeting and that they will help the Section Delegates and MSS RD/ADs in bringing their resolution to the AMA HOD. This would include but not be limited to updating whereas clauses for the next meeting with the most up to date literature, crafting testimony for the VRC and live Reference Committee hearings, and reaching out to specialty societies. D. Scoring Stage 1. Resolutions should be scored based on authorship (section, state, region). 2. Resolutions should be scored based on clarity. 3. Resolutions should be scored based on research quality. 4. Resolutions should be scored based on scope. 5. Resolutions should be scored based on feasibility. 6. Resolutions should be scored based on novelty. 7. Resolutions should be scored based on how well they address AMA Strategic Focus Areas. 8. Resolutions should be scored based on how well they address MSS Policy Objectives. a. The Section Delegates should be responsible for conducting an annual survey which sets the MSS Policy Objectives for the given year. b. A resolution's score of how well it addresses MSS Policy Objectives should make up a larger proportion of the overall score (currently 10%). 9. Resolutions should be scored based on whether they responded to feedback. 10. Resolutions should be scored on a quantitative scale. 11. Resolutions should be scored with consideration of their fiscal note. E. VRC/Reference Committee Stage 1. Create a new Reference Committee recommendation category named \"recommend for GC action item.\" 2. Adjust resolution deadlines to allow more time for review between the final submission and VRC. 3. Release the list of final resolutions prior to VRC opening so that regions and states will have more time to organize their resolution review processes. 4. Have HCC post a summary of their comments from the draft review process to the VRC. 5. After final resolutions are submitted, the HOD Coordination Committee (HCC) will review all submissions and place items on a Reaffirmation Consent Calendar based on simple majority voting within the Committee. The selected items will not receive detailed staff review except analysis from Legal Counsel. The selected items will be displayed on the Virtual Reference Committee as \"Reaffirmation Consent Calendar\" separate from the Resolutions folder and Reports folder. The Reaffirmation Consent Calendar will be open for comments on the VRC but will not be business of the MSS Assembly unless extracted during the MSS Assembly Opening Session. 6. Have RD/ADs provide meaningful testimony on the VRC for resolutions they reviewed, especially in cases where important recommendations were not considered. 35 7. Conduct debate on lower scoring resolutions in a live forum where people can vote ahead of the Assembly. The vote can eliminate resolutions before the Assembly. F. Assembly Stage 1. Create the Assembly's Order of Business according to resolution scores. 2. Cap the number of resolutions for discussion at the Assembly. 3. Cap the number of resolution that can be forwarded to the HOD from each Assembly. 4. Designate specific microphones as PRO, CON, and repeat speaker microphones. 5. Provide a report after each Assembly meeting on the impact of the resolutions passed. 6. Establish a threshold vote required to extract a resolution. 7. Place a time limit on discussion for each resolution or on the amount of time each Delegate may speak at one time. 8. Separate Assembly time so that resolutions above a certain threshold receive more time for debate, with the remaining time divided between resolutions below the threshold. 9. Create a new, informational category of business for the Assembly that would be reviewed by Standing Committees. a. Addendum: Consider adding a separate session where the authors can present informational business. 10. Give delegates points that they can use at the end of the Assembly to prioritize external resolutions. 36 Appendix E. Resolution Alternatives Resolution Alternatives Prior to drafting a resolution, all potential authors should contact their Regional Delegate to determine whether a resolution is the best course of action. Sometimes it may not be necessary or appropriate to submit a resolution to the AMA-MSS Assembly for consideration. Alternatives include: 1. Submitting a request for action to the AMA-MSS Governing Council 2. Researching work being done by other medical societies or health care groups 3. Working with state and county medical societies 4. Working with the administration or other leaders at your medical school 5. Co-authoring a resolution that someone else is submitting Consider the following situations in which writing a resolution might not be the most efficient way of addressing the issue. Situation 1: AMA policy exists, but there has not been much action. Students are encouraged to submit a request for action to the Governing Council if there is an issue addressed by existing policy that needs follow up. Students should provide the Chair with background information about the issue, the AMA or MSS policy that covers action on the issue, and the proposed action that should be taken. It is important to note that the AMA and MSS face limited financial and time resources, so it may not be possible to follow up with every policy request. Similarly, though, it would not be possible to implement every new policy created by a new resolution in a thorough and meaningful way. Situation 2: General AMA policy exists, but a specific issue needs attention. Strong policies support general principles that can be applied across a variety of similar circumstances. In cases where general policy exists, but a specific issue demands action, MSS members are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of the MSS Governing Council so that appropriate follow-up action may be taken. Such action may include encouraging the AMA to prepare a letter in support of a specific piece of legislation, disseminating existing information to medical school section leaders to educate their peers, or working with the AMA to publicize our position on a certain issue. Situation 3: The issue is important, but may be best approached by another organization or entity. The AMA is a great venue for creating change, however some topics may be best approached by another organization or entity. In many cases we are not the appropriate group, or we do not possess the influence or expertise necessary to pursue the issue. In other cases, limited resources require the AMA-MSS to focus its energy on issues of national importance to medical students, rather than on issues of more limited scope. It is critical that, within the MSS, we acknowledge37 the need to focus our agenda to have a stronger impact on those issues that we have a can influence. Please contact the Governing Council Delegate or Alternate Delegate to learn more about different venues and vehicles for change and where your goals would be best achieved. Students are encouraged to consider if their school, community, or state or local medical society could provide assistance with the issue of interest to them. In addition, National Medical Specialty societies may be more effective than the AMA in dealing with certain issues, since, by definition, the constellation of issues on which they spend their time and resources deals only with those related to a single specialty. Students are encouraged to check relevant medical society web sites to see what activity is already taking place. Also, students are encouraged to contact mentors, faculty, and other physician contacts to see if they would be willing to bring relevant issues to the attention of their specialty society. Situation 4: I want to be involved! To facilitate maximum involvement in the policy-making process, while at the same time respecting the need to prioritize issues and reduce the number of individual items of business, students are strongly encouraged to seek co-sponsors for their resolutions, and to work with their state delegations and their sections to build support for strong resolutions. Authoring a resolution is only one element of the policy making process, along with gathering research, educating the Assembly about the resolution, providing testimony in reference committee, and motivating implementation. Each of these elements is crucial to strong policy development, and many are currently left undone by resolution authors. R EPORT OF THE MSS GOVERNING COUNCIL GC Report A, A-18 Subject: Pilot Implementation of the 2018 Resolution Task Force Recommendations Presented by: MSS Governing Council (Helene Nepomuceno, Chair) Referred to: MSS Reference Committee (----, Chair) I NTRODUCTION 1 After the 2017 Interim Meeting of the American Medical Association Medical Student Section (AMA- 2 MSS), the AMA-MSS Governing Council (GC) convened a MSS Resolution Process Task Force to make 3 recommendations to strengthen the current resolution process. 4 The charge to the MSS Resolution Process Task Force (RTF) was to assess the effectiveness of our 5 current resolution process in achieving its goals, to collect and evaluate information on the impact of our 6 current process on the various stakeholders in our process, and to recommend actions and efforts that 7 would have a meaningful positive impact on the major resolution process concerns: 8 a. Insufficient time for adequate discussion of resolutions in the Assembly 9 b. Impact on student leadership (including sectional and regional delegates as well as the 10 MSS House of Delegates Coordinating Committee) 11 c. Impact on AMA staff (including MSS staff and non-MSS experts) 12 d. Number of external resolutions forwarded to House of Delegates (HOD) 13 14 The RTF produced MSS RTF Report 1-A-18, containing recommendations for resolution process reforms 15 that the RTF believes will encourage mentorship within the MSS, protect the democratic opportunity to 16 be heard, foster high-quality discussion in the MSS Assembly, and preserve resources for the advocacy of 17 MSS-originated resolutions in the AMA House of Delegates (HOD). The RTF recommended that the 18 MSS GC consider its proposed reforms to the resolution process and release a GC Report to the Assembly 19 detailing a pilot implementation of the reforms. 20 21 The MSS GC conducted a review of recommendations proposed by the RTF within MSS RTF Report 1- 22 A-18. Based on the Task Forc re commendations, the MSS GC has outlined in this report a pilot 23 process to be implemented during the next cycle of the resolution process for the 2018 MSS Interim 24 Meeting and HOD Interim Meeting. 25 26 27 PILOT RESOLUTION PROCESS 28 Your GC recommends the implementation of a pilot based on the following reforms during the next cycle 29 of the resolution process, and that the remainder of the report be filed. Following the pilot, the MSS GC 30 will produce a GC report to the Assembly for the 2019 Annual Meeting proposing changes to the MSS 31 resolution process through amendments to the MSS Internal Operating Procedures. 32 33 1. That the MSS invest in further education efforts on the resolution process by: 34a . Training RD/ADs to provide better guidance on the various mechanisms available for 35 advocacy through the AMA and MSS. 36 b. Making a video explaining the basics of Parliamentary Procedure and the most common 37 mistakes made. 38 39 2. That the MSS elevate the stature of non-resolution avenues for advocacy by: 40 a. Clarifying what makes a successful GC Action Item, publicizing GC Action Item 41 Requests widely, and increasing the prestige of these proposals. 42 b. Creating a new, informational category of business for the Assembly, which would be 43 presented by authors in a separate programming session at the meeting. The process for 44 accepting and reviewing submissions for this category of business and executing this 45 session will be directed by MSS Standing Committees and the MSS GC Vice Chair. 46 c. Providing a formal document to its members as proof of significant, non-resolution- 47 related work, which they can provide as support for a conference funding and time-off 48 request. Examples of significant, non-resolution-related work include serving as a 49 Delegate or on a Committee. 50 51 3. That the MSS encourage mentorship between its members and throughout the AMA by: 52 a. Creating a voluntary indicator on the Open Forum and during the resolution draft phase 53 that shows if the originator is a first-time author. This visibility would allow more 54 experienced writers to help new authors and mentor them through the process. 55 b. Requiring all external resolution authors to contact the relevant specialty society prior to 56 submission. 57 58 4. That the MSS improve transparency of resolution feedback among all actors throughout the 59 resolution process by: 60 a. Tasking the Government Relations Advocacy Fellow and Section Delegates with 61 analyzing the Open Forum and resolution drafts for resolutions that the AMA Federal 62 Advocacy Office would be interested in reviewing. These roles are noted by the MSS 63 GC to have an appropriate level of understanding of what would be suitable for review by 64 the Federal Advocacy Office. 65 b. Broadening the functional scope of the House of Delegates Coordinating Committee 66 (HCC) so HCC members can contact Region leaders to improve resolutions that would 67 otherwise likely be reaffirmed. 68 c. Requiring primary reviewers to send feedback 69 R egion Chair and Region Delegation Chair in order to allow Regions to incorporate draft 70 feedback into their Region authorship voting if they choose to. 71 d. Requesting that HCC post a summary of their comments from the draft review process to 72 the VRC. 73 e. Requesting that RD/ADs provide meaningful testimony on the VRC for resolutions they 74 reviewed, especially in cases where important recommendations from feedback provided 75 to authors were not considered. 7677 5. That the MSS streamline existing procedures in the resolution process by: 78 a. Coordinating Region resolution authorship/support through a central AMA email process 79 so more medical school sections can be reached. 80 b. Giving HCC responsibility to review all submissions and place items on a Reaffirmation 81 Consent Calendar. Items on the Reaffirmation Consent Calendar will not receive detailed 82 staff review except analysis from Legal Counsel. 83 c. Adjusting resolution deadlines to allow more time for review between the final 84 submission and VRC. 8586 6. T hat the MSS change its scoring rubric to: 87 a. Reaffirm its existing rubric categories of authorship, clarity, research quality, scope, 88 feasibility, novelty, addressing the MSS Policy Objectives and AMA Strategic Focus 89 Areas, thoughtful response to feedback, and scoring on a quantitative scale. 90 b. For external resolutions, increase the scoring weight of addressing the MSS Policy 91 Objectives over that of addressing the AMA Strategic Focus Areas, as a way to promote 92 Section objectives. 93 c. Include scoring of the fiscal note as a consideration for feasibility, instead of as a separate 94 rubric category. 95 96 7. That the MSS reaffirm its existing process of creating 97 a ccording to quantitative resolution scores. 9899 8. That the MSS create and further opportunities for high-quality discussion in the Assembly by: 100 a. The MSS Reference Committee noting in its rationale whether resolutions are suitable for 101 a GC Action item. GC Action items may be submitted by the originating author or by 102 individual members of the Section. 103 b. Prioritizing Assembly time so that resolutions above a certain threshold receive protected 104 time for debate, with the remaining time divided between resolutions below the threshold. 105 Determination of this threshold shall be based on consideration of the amount of time 106 needed to discuss a resolution and the amount of Assembly time available. To aid in this 107 determination for I-18, GC will collect data at A-18 on how much time is spent 108 discussing each resolution. 109 110 9. That the MSS improve continuity of its advocacy efforts from meeting to meeting by: 111 a. Requiring authors of external resolutions to sign a virtual acknowledgement agreeing to 112 help the Section Delegates and Regional Delegates in bringing their resolution to the 113 AMA HOD if their resolution is passed by the Assembly. 114 b. Tracking the outcome of MSS-initiated external resolutions that have had influence or 115 impact. An example of influence or impact is action taken or statements made by the 116 AMA Board of Trustees. These outcomes can be recorded by the MSS GC and shared 117 with the Section membership. 118 c. Giving the MSS GC responsibility for conducting an annual survey that sets the MSS 119 Policy Objectives for the given year. 120For the best user experience, please download a copy of this handbook to your personal device Elect ion Manual Vi sit the MSS meeting documents webpage to download the Election "}
