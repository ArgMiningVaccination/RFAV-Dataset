The Judiciary Committee is authorized by the House to conduct oversight and legislate on matters concerning civil liberties, the separation of powers, and the judiciary. Each Member of Congress has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. As Members of the House Judi ciary Committee and/or the Weaponization Subcommittee, each Member has an institutional interest in protecting First Amend- ment rights from encroachment by the execu tive branch, protecting the rule of law, and holding the executive branch accountable when it overreaches. This interest also includes ensuring that the courts police those constitutional boundaries. Each Member signatory is concerned that the Biden Administration has vio- lated the Constitution and abridged American s' civil liberties. The House Judiciary Committee and the Weaponization Subco mmittee have been conducting an ongoing investigation into how and to what extent the executive branch has coerced or col- luded with social media companies to cen sor speech. Very recent evidence, obtained in said investigation in the weeks after the district court's preliminary injunction Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 9 08/07/2023 2 ruling, further corroborates the district court's findings. Thus, each Member signa- tory has a substantial interest in this cas e and offers a unique perspective by virtue of his or her role in Congress.1 1 All parties consented to th e filing of this brief.

Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 10 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 3 INTRODUCTION Wielding threats of intervention, the executive branch of the federal govern- ment has engaged in a sustai ned effort to coerce privat e parties into censoring speech on matters of public concern. On issue af ter issue, the Biden Administration has distorted the free marketplace of ideas prom ised by the First Amendment, bringing the weight of federal authority to bear on any speech it dislikes\u2014including memes and jokes. Of course, Big Tech compan ies often required little coercion to do the Administration's bidding on some issues. Ge nerally eager to please their ideological allies and overseers in the federal government, these co mpanies and other private entities have repeatedly censored accurate speech on important public issues. When the censors were too slow to suppress speech that the partisans in the Administration disliked, the federal governme nt prodded them back into action with continual and increasing pressure. Official pressure to suppress speech vi olates the First Amendment. \"[A] prin- cipal function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. It may indeed best serve its high purpose when it induces a condition of unrest, creates dissatisfaction with conditions as they ar e, or even stirs people to anger.\" Texas v. Johnson , 491 U.S. 397, 408-09 (1989) (cleaned up). No doubt, the government may find some individuals' speech \"misguided, or even hurtful,\" but \"the point of all speech protection is to shield just those choices of content.\" Snyder v. Phelps , 562 Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 11 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 4 U.S. 443, 458 (2011) (cleaned up). \"The Fi rst Amendment embodies our choice as a Nation that, when it comes to such spe ech, the guiding principle is freedom\u2014the unfettered interchange of ideas\u2014not whatever the State may view as fair.\" Arizona Free Enter. Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett , 564 U.S. 721, 750 (2011) (cleaned up). The First Amendment is founded on \"the hypothesis that speech can rebut speech, propaganda will answer propaga nda, [and] free debate of ideas will result in the wisest governmental policies.\" Dennis v. United States , 341 U.S. 494, 503 (1951). Thus, the First Amendment sta nds against any governmental effort to coerce or otherwise burden the free speech of private entities\u2014even if that action falls short of outright suppression. Cf. Kennedy v. Warren , 66 F.4th 1199, 1213 (9th Cir. 2023) (Bennett, J., concu rring) (\"[W]e do not require a government official to list specific consequences in order to find a constitutional violation.\"). The district court found, as a matter of fact, that \"the United States Govern- ment, through the White House and numerous federal agencies, pressured and en- couraged social-media compan ies to suppress free speech.\" , 2023 WL 4335270, at *44 (W.D. La. July 4, 2023). These factual findings \"must be left undisturbed unless clearly erroneous.\" Direct Biologics, LLC v. McQueen , 63 F.4th 1015, 1020 (5th Cir. 2023) (cleaned up). \"W here there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder's choice betw een them cannot be clearly erroneous.\" Anderson v. Bessemer , 5 The district court's findings are easily \"permissible\"; they are clearly correct. Beyond the ample evidence cited by the district court and the Plaintiffs, even more recent evidence obtained by the House Ju diciary Committee and the Weaponization Subcommittee confirms the dist rict court's conclusions. That evidence shows that the Biden Ad ministration has rele ntlessly pressured private entities\u2014sometimes in cooperation with other private entities\u2014to censor speech that the Administration disliked. As detailed below, this official coercion has undermined the marketplace of ideas on issu es of public importance ranging from COVID to federal elections to Biden fa mily misdeeds. And the suppression \"does not simply have an effect on speech, but is directed at certain content and is aimed at particular speakers\": conservative voices opposed to the current Administration. Barr v. Am. Ass'n of Pol. Consultants, Inc. , 140 S. Ct. 2335, 2347 (2020). \"This thy neighbor' approach to fr ee speech\u2014restricting the speech of some elements of our society in order to enha nce the relative voice of others\u2014is wholly foreign to the First Amendment.\" Bennett , 564 U.S. at 741 (cleaned up). Likewise foreign to the First Amendment are governm ental efforts to coerce the speech of private Americans. \"As a Nation we have c hosen a different course\u2014to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate.\" Snyder , 562 U.S. at Page: 13 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 6 Because the Biden Administration has repeatedly used government coercion to stifle public debate\u2014and the district co urt's injunction rightfully halts the Admin- istration's unlawful conduct\u2014the Court should affirm. ARGUMENT I. The United States has coer ced speech about COVID. As the district court found, the fe deral government \"suppr essed alternative views\" about COVID-related matters, including the origination of the virus, the ef- ficacy of vaccines and masks, and the advers e effects of lockdowns, effectively forc- ing social media companies to enforce the government's view as \"the truth.\" Biden , 2023 WL 4335270, at *49-50. The district cour t listed over twenty examples of the government engaging in coercive acts dir ected toward social media companies to bring about censorship. Id. at *45-47. And the govern ment's pressure campaign worked. Facebook agreed to moderate certa in COVID-related speech in response to pressure from the Biden Administration, telling the government that Facebook would rely on their \"authorities\" to determine what content to censor. Id. at *5, *6, *50. The district court described the govern ment's direction of Facebook's content choices as a \"partner[ship].\" Id. at *47. Very recent evidence corroborates the di strict court's findings. The House Ju- diciary Committee subpoenaed internal docum ents from Meta, the parent entity of Facebook and Instagram. The documents obtained thus far confirm that the Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 14 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 7 companies censored information and alte red their content m oderation policies be- cause of pressure from the Biden Administra tion to rid their platforms of purported \"misinformation.\"2 This pressure was direct and coercive . For example, the Administration tried to suppress discussion of COVID's orig ins: when a Facebook executive asked in July 2021 why the company censored the C OVID lab leak theory , an executive in charge of content policy de velopment said, \"[b]ecause we were under pressure from the [A]dministration\" to do so.3 The same Facebook executive confessed that the company \"shouldn't have done it.\"4 Yet Facebook continued to do the Administration's bidding, repeatedly re- moving and reducing content the federal government di sfavored. The Biden White House's successful months-long campaign to censor views expressing or supporting vaccine hesitancy is the clearest exampl e of how the government coerced social 2 Rep.

In an internal email, a Facebook empl oyee explained to CEO Mark Sandberg: \"We are f acing continued pressure from external stakeholders, including the [Biden] White House and the press, to remove more COVID-19 vaccine discouraging content.\"5 Another Facebook executive notified his team that a senior advisor to President Biden was \"outraged\" \"tha t [Facebook] did not remove\" a meme that bothered the Administration.6 Likewise, to appease the Admi nistration, Facebook demoted a Tucker Carlson video critical of the COVID vaccine, even though Facebook admit- ted that the video did not violate company policy.7 5 Ex. 2 (E-mail from Face book employee to Facebook em ployees (Apr. 27, 2021, 11:58 AM)) (emphasis in original). 6 Ex. 3 (E-mail from Nick Clegg to Fa cebook employees (Apr. 19, 2021, 9:40 AM)).

Accordin g to Facebook's inter- nal notes of meetings with White House se nior advisors, White House officials ques- tioned whether Facebook's enforcement of its content moderation policies against the New York Post was aggressive enough.8 Similarly, in April 2021, a White House official questioned whether Facebook could \"change [its] algorithm so that people were more likely to see [the New York Times ], [the Wall Street Journal ], any author- itative news [the] polarizing people.\"9 The White House's requests were rooted in th e paternalistic notion that Americans can- not decide for themselves what information should or should not be believed. As a White House staffer condesce ndingly remarked in a meeting with Facebook in April 2021, \"[i]f someone in rural Arkansas sees something on [Facebook], it's the 8 Ex. 4 (Facebook employee's notes of a call between White House personnel and Facebook employees on March 26, 2021).

In July 2021, President Biden publicly denounced these companies, particularly Facebook, claiming they were \"killing people\" by not censoring alle ged \"misinformation\" to the govern- ment's satisfaction.12 Facebook employees internally lamented that the Biden White House's \"definition of 'misin fo' is completely unclear.\"13 Following the White House's pressure, Facebook leadership\u2014int ernally admitting that the move was \"stemming from the continued criticism of our approach from the [Biden] admin- istration\"\u2014directed employees to \"brainst orm some additional po licy levers we can 10 Ex. 6 (Facebook employee's notes of a call between White House personnel and Facebook employees on April 5, 2021). 11 Ex. 7 (Facebook employee's notes of a call between White House personnel and Facebook employees on June 15, 2021). 12 Nandita Bose and Elizabeth Culliford, Biden Says Facebook, Others 'Killing Peo- ple' by Carrying COVID Misinformation , REUTERS (Jul. 16, 2021), https://ti- nyurl.com/zpt53rna. 13 Ex. 8 (E-mail from Facebook employee to Facebook employees (July 16, 2021, 8:14 PM)).

For example, when the Administration flagged satirical content about the COVID vaccine, a Fa- cebook executive first warned that removing satirical content would \"represent a significant incursion into traditional boun daries of free expression in the US.\"20 But the Biden Administration was unpersuaded, insisting that the content \"inhibits con- fidence\" in the COVID vaccine.21 A Facebook vice president warned intern ally that the company was at \"a crossroads\" with the Administra tion over its censorship efforts.22 Facebook execu- tives grasped the connection between the company's business prospects and staying in the Administration's good graces. One executive, recommending that the com- pany consider bending to the Administra tion's censorship requests, cautioned COO Sheryl Sandberg that Facebook had \"bigger fish we have to fry with the Administra- tion \u2014 data flows etc.\"23 19 Ex. 13 (Facebook employee's notes of a call between OSG pe rsonnel and Face- book employees on July 16, 2021). 20 Ex. 3 (E-mail from Nick Cl egg to Facebook employees). 21 Id. 22 Id. 23 Ex. 11 (E-mail from Facebook em ployee to Facebook employees).

As the dis- trict court explained, Section 230 of th e Communications Decency Act is \"valuable\" to Big Tech because of its legal protections. Biden , 2023 WL 4335270, at *47. And the district court found that the federal gove rnment \"threat[ened]\" Big Tech with the repeal of Section 230 to induce comp liance with its censorship campaign. Id. Mark Zuckerberg has referred to th e possibility of antitrust enfo rcement as an \"existential threat\" to his empire. Id. at *4. Four days after President Biden publicly accused Facebook of \"killing people,\" the White H ouse Communications Director publicly said the Administration was \"reviewing\" Section 230 reform as an option because the social media companies \"should be held accountable.\"24 Internal documents show that Facebook executives feared that the Biden Administration would retaliate against the company for not censoring enough: one executive commented that the dispute over content was not \"a great place fo r us to be,\" and he would be \"grateful for any further creative thinking on how we can be responsive to their [content] con- cerns.\"25 In response to mounting pressure, Facebook capitulated: \"By August 2021, 24 Betsy Klein, White House Reviewing Section 230 Amid Efforts to Push Social Media Giants to Crack Down on Misinformation , CNN (Jul. 20, 2021), https://ti- nyurl.com/73hnfk3h. 25 Ex. 11 (E-mail from Facebook em ployee to Facebook employees).

And out of self-interest, the companie s complied and censored content beyond what it otherwise would have. This government coercion violates the First Amendment. II.

Let us know if any feedback or if there's anything missing here. Thanks so much, Subject: [For Decision] Vaccine continued pressure fro~er I stakeholders, including the White House and the press, to remove more COVID-19 vaccine discour , . For example, we recently shared with the White House a list of the to 100 vaccine-re lated osts on Bin e .S. for the week of 4/5-4/11. While authoritative information dominated the list, the Whift_~ concerned that the #3 post was a vaccine discouraging humorous meme, and they called on us to de~ __ the cov;d vaccine has microchips) and content that explicitly discourages vaccination (e.g., the COVID-19 vaccine is too dangerous -don't get it!). Under our policies, this meme should not be removed. Instead, we aim to reduce this sort of vaccine discouraging content, namely 'sensational or alamiist content' (e.g., there's no point vaccines are useless!; vaccines are the work of the devil; these vaxx are so bad for your body!) and 'criticism of personal vaccine choices' (e.g., it's child abuse to give your kid the vaccine; you'd have to be a complete moron to get vaccinated). CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTIO N MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-11 TO HJC CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053366To reduce this content, we are currently building systems to review & demote on escalation, and over time hope to have demotions at scale through classifiers (although that kind of scaled enforcement is likely to be challenging). We are not convinced we'll be able to catch all kinds of this content quickly enough before it gains some distribution. Additionally, given people's interest in the topic, weaker demotions may not be sufficient to meaningfully limit the distribution of posts. Based on consultations with vaccination communication experts and other health partners, we worry that removing (as opposed to demoting) more expressions of vaccine hesitancy might be counterproductive to the goal of vaccine uptake, because it would: 1/ prevent hesitant people from talking through their concerns online and 2/ reinforce the notion that there's a cover-up (a key prong of anti-vaccine narratives). Details of feedback from external experts and research are below. We seek your guidance on how to treat this vaccine discouraging content. Here are the options: 1. 25% demotion (current plan, execution under way) 2. ~50% demotion, or even stronger (e.g., 80%) if we find that 50% isn't sufficient to keep such content out of top vaccine posts 3. Remove this content Details below. Thanks, A. Definitions of the Vaccine Discouraging Content in Question 1. Sensational or Alarmist Vaccine Content: Content that otherwise does not violate our COVID-19 or vaccine policies above but that suggests that vaccines are unsafe, ineffective, sacrilegious or irrelevant, in exaggerated, conspiratorial, or sensational terms. This includes content that makes generalizations about vaccine harms or utility in hyperbolic terms or without providing context, or which connects vaccination to a conspiratorial narrative about a purposely hidden widespread health harm, secret, or truth. a. Ex: \"They're coming with these dangerous shots for you next --the sheep of the world need to wake up.\" b. Ex: \"Vaccines are the work of the Devil\" c. Ex: \"These VAXX are so bad for your body!\" d. Ex: \"Vaccines are so useless, what's the point!\" e. Ex: \"I need to detox my kid to get these vaccine toxins out. .. Any ideas?\" 2. Criticizing the Choice to Receive/Provide Vaccines: Content that otherwise does not violate our COVID-19 or vaccine policies above but that disparages others on the basis of their choice to get vaccinated, or on their choice to vaccinate others, including attacking language used towards vaccinated people or those administering vaccinations, or blaming people for misfortune after vaccination.

Ex: \"You're committing child abuse for giving this vaccine.\" b. Ex: \"Only someone clinically insane would get this vaccine!\" c. Ex: \"Any extreme pro-vaxers unfriend me. You are a danger to public health you thick, unscientific twats\" d. Ex: \"I can't believe they got vaccinated, what idiot sheeple\" e. Ex: \"Take a look around people --anyone who gets these experimental vaccines is just a guinea pig.\" B. Options for Addressing Severe Vaccine Discouraging Content 1. 25% demotion..- plan of record, still need to execute -consistent with the Integrity Ranking Guidelines (IRGs), we can demote by 25%. We are just beginning to do this. a. Pros: slows distribution of such content; consistent with normal practice for demoting problematic content without specific user notice/appeals b. Cons: unsatisfactory to certain critics who want us to take even stronger action; some demoted content may still go viral 2. ~50% demotion, or even stronger (e.g., 80%) if we find that 50% isn't sufficient to keep such content out of top vaccine posts a. Pros: may satisfy some critics who want more aggressive action; significantly reduces virality of vaccine discouraging content b. Cons: inconsistent with normal practice for demoting problematic content without specific user notice/appeals; could be seen as shadowbanning 3. Remove a. Pros: may satisfy certain vocal critics; best option to reduce virality b. Cons: removes true content and personal opinions; reduces public conversation on important issue; provides \"evidence\" to people who believe FB is overly censorious or participating in vaccine cover-ups C. External Perspectives on Removing More Vax Hesitancy Content Since 2018, we have consulted extensively with external experts about our approach to vaccine content on Facebook and our engagement has stepped up significantly during the COVID pandemic. We have received varied responses on what the right approach is when it comes to removal and have modest confidence in our current approach. Some key health partners, including the WHO, continue to advocate for removing much more content. The WHO has communicated to us that they think our current policies are not comprehensive enough especially when it comes to takedowns of entities that they believe we should be removing due to the harmful impact they have on vaccine confidence (and, in turn, ending the pandemic). As mentioned above, the White House also continues to put significant pressure on removing more. However, many vaccine communication experts seem to think we are now in the right place in terms of policy\u00ad writing about what content we remove vs. reduce. Among these experts, there is a general sense that deleting more expressions of vaccine hesitancy might be counterproductive to the goal of vaccine uptake, because it would: 1/ prevent hesitant people from talking through their concerns and 2/ reinforce the notion that there's a cover-up (a key prong of anti-vax narratives). These risks seem particularly acute now in the US, because we are quickly approaching the point of supply exceeding demand and remaining vaccine holdouts being due to genuine hesitancy. Some experts have voiced the value in hesitant people being able to seek answers to their questions and having their concerns addressed. There may be risk of pushing them further toward hesitancy by suppressing their speech and making them feel marginalized by large institutions. Prior external research on effective interventions to address vaccine hesitancy highlights the critical importance of facilitating open dialogue, especially dialogue that is or that can be tailored to the individual or their communities. Research suggests that attitude change happens when people get a chance for productive discourse and addressing people's concerns head on (rather than reducing chances for conversation) can lead to positive change. Opening up a chance for people to express their hesitancy, criticism and concerns can serve as an important way for them to access information. Moreover, past on-platform network research has suggested that there is likely to be a backlash from taking down conspiracy-oriented networks' content, though in light of lessons learned we may be better equipped to handle it with our tools than we have previously. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 53 Date Filed: 08/07/2023PRODUCED TO HJC CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053368Consistent with this reasoning, in March, the Washington Post Editorial Board published a piece titled, \"Banning vaccine-hesitant posts is not the way to ease people's fears\" which made the case that removals (and broad, strong demotions) would be counterproductive: \"sweeping takedowns or down-rankings of all borderline content could foster more misgiving, and deprive people of the opportunity to discuss and learn.\" Our conversations with experts informed the creation of the \"Barriers to Vaccination (B2V): Vaccine Content Quality Integrity Framework\" (from which we excerpted the definitions above), and we've since vetted this framework with outside experts. Of note, in early March, we discussed our planned approach with members of the \"High Level Panel on Vaccine Confidence & Misinformation\" (organized by London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Center for Strategic and International Studies). Key take-aways: The panel had very positive feedback for our framework, calling it \"sophisticated and nuanced.\" They appreciated that the B2V work addresses a critical gray zone of content that may contribute to vaccine hesitancy. The Panelists highlighted the importance of avoiding unintended consequences that may be associated with squashing expression on the platform. Experts underscored that they would be very hesitant about removing content that leads users to discuss vaccines. They expressed concern around stifling healthy debate about the vaccines, especially with regard to the sharing of personal vaccine anecdotes or other vaccine discussion and debate. For example, some pointed to the importance of facilitating open conversation online between parents whose children experienced adverse effects from the COVID vaccine. While thinking through our policies, we also recently met with Heidi Larson, the head of the Vaccine Confidence Project. Heidi's general view is that we need to create an open and safe space for people to have vaccine\u00ad related conversations. She believes we need to hear about people's fears and anxieties related to the vaccine and respond appropriately (not just throw facts at people but understand there is an emotion behind people's claims and questions). We met with Heidi again on 4/26 to check in on whether our approach to content expressing vaccine hesitancy was still in the right place. While acknowledging that it's a complicated time due to recent discouraging safety events, she continues to support not removing this content due to the aforementioned potential inadvertent effects of removing this kind of content and is happy to be a spokesperson for us. D. Content Examples A. Content we REMOVE Violating Misinformation & Harm +-REMOVE Case: 23-30445 that is of course right: identify the gaps in their views and our policies (incl via feedback from the researchers they1ve been listening to); identify whether there really are such significant gaps between our approach and YT's; see what further steps we can take.

Andy attended a meeting of misinfo researchers {didn't provide names) organized by Rob Fon Friday in which the consensus was that FB is a \"disinforma tion factory\", and that YT has made significant advances to remove content leading to vaccine hesitancy whilst we have lagged behind. Whilst appreciative of our emphasis on authoritative vaccine, the principal focus for Andy Sand his team in the coming weeks is to reach the \"hardest to reach\" people who have a propensity to consume vaccine hesitant related content and who are not swayed by official/authoritative sources of content. Our systems, he believes -as confirmed by the researchers - feed vaccine hesitant related content to pockets of the population and that's the problem he wants our help to resolve. As an eg, he was outraged -not too strong a word to describe his reaction -that we did not remove this post which was third most highly ranked post in the data set we sent to him: https://www.facebook.com/td.mccomas/posts/4106421952731017 I countered that removing content like that would represent a significan t incursion into traditional boundaries of free expression in the US but he replied that the post was directly comparing Covid vaccines to asbestos poisoning in a way which demonstrably inhibits confidence in Covid vaccines amongst those the Biden Administration is trying to reach. [It would be very helpful if someone could plse check whether this content was also available on YT-Andy's assumption is that YT would never accept something like this] V worrying ly, towards the end of the conversation, Andy told me in confidence -s~ase treat it as such -that internal FB employees are leaking to his team {I assume via Rob F) accounts of disobliging r~~rks frade about both Andy and Rob by FB decision makers. Further, that those remarks are coupled with suggestions abou ~~ B should \"snow\" the White House with info/data about authoritative Covid info in order not to share the most ~elh, pful data about content which contributes to vaccine hesitancy. We then discussed the wider issue of trust th lack of it -between FB and the Biden team related to the events during the election and beyond, but needle~ay as shocked and embarrassed that somehow we ace pecceived to be behaving so unprofessionally. ~ V We concluded that he would ask Rob F to share the data and poli recimmendations from the researchers with us asap so that we could give a considered reply on further steps we may/mar~' '61e to take.

Crowdtangle shows engagement not views, and a simple text search for \"vaccine\" in Crowdtangle doesn't have the same recall as our classifiers, i.e., doesn't include all of the posts about vaccines. The data that we provided doesn't include the Tucker Carlson video because our data pipelines don't populate that quickly- we provided data for the week before. Why label this content with a generic \"visit the covid information center\" message? Our more granular label about vaccine safety says \"COVID-19 vaccines go through many test for safety and effectively before they're approved \". In light of the decision to pause the J&J vaccine, vaccine safety discussion evolved past \"approval,\" and we were concerned that this was a confusing/irrelevant message to be applying to content discussion the decision to pause J&J without revoking approva l. We temporarily reverted to a more generic message and are updating the more specific label for posts about vaccine safety to say \"COVID-19 vaccines go through many tests for safety and effectiveness and then are monitored closely\" to try to adapt to the changing factual situation and evolving discussion.

We see authoritative info from WHO having a lot of hesitancy comments. Top skepticism comments on those posts, don't Rob - so you're focused on virality, big entities like pages/groups, less on comments/posts between friends - for the most part, right - the way we think about - head problem - where do we see hot spots - minority individuals/entities producing content that then gets resdistributed. From prioritization perspective, that's how we know content will beredistributed/upranked/reshared. This is for hesitancy (not misinfo, which gets different treatment). We want to know overall hesitancy content, what areinterventions. Detection methodology is dependent on topical conversations - that will take weeks, if not months. So in the interim, focused on the hot s pots. Does that make sense? Rob - yes, makes sense. Do you have a tangible example? Done or seen is helpful. - I asked the teams this morning - overall viral pieces of content - anecdotally, they've shared oTopics trending towards uncertainty - FDA approval v authorization - general confusion about that oAnother one - concerns about vaccinated peop e shedding the virus to non- vaccinated people nearby - indirect oHave seen a lot of groups sharing individual stories about side effects or deathafter vaccination oIf we're taking authoritative information - we could detect outright discouragement based on a reliable link, but it's harder to detect skepticalcomments like \"Oh, isn't that interesting.\" - we are working to be able to detect that, but we can't yet Rob - that makes sense Fascinating. I'm curious - NY Post churning out articles every day about people dying. What is supposed to happen to that from Policy perspective. Does that article get a reduction, labels? - Let's go back to remove (outright misinfo), reduce (not benign, more sensationalism, eg claim vaccines create miscarriages, indirect discouragement), inform -levers are contingent on content type, who posted it. We look at removing from recommendations, explorer, we w ant to take all this content out of that. E.g. Health Groups are non -recommendable, want to get them out of areas where we recommend or amplification systems. What we're prioritizing in feed - want to make sure that anything we suspect is hitting skeptic ism, harmful topically but we can't remove, we reduce. I don't have those numbers today. - a lot of things get viral copy -pasted. We have a concept of introducing an inform interstitial - if I go to reshare post like that, have an interstitial noting that a post has been rated false by 3PFC. We can also do fwd limits. These are are all methodswe've used where there's not super clear lines in the sand. That's a suite of tools we'retrying to apply right now. Rob - The question I have, if you're applying these methodologies, where is it still breaking through? And to whom? If it' s still there, where is next whack a mole?

We're getting better at detecting things like the microchip thing and delete that. We're getting better at detecting (human, natural language processing) discouragement. We find COVID posts, then we identify posts that are explicit discouragement, or this is bullying for choosing to get vaccinated. What's hard right now, we haven't completed fulldetection path. We need to close gaps, that's what we're doing. The comments thing isn't solved, that's the big thing keeping me up at night, that I'm most worried aboutfrom an implementation perspective. Rob - so substantive problem is not that there are holes in the policy, it's more that the detection of things that needs more work - the hard part is that what could be applicable to policy is moving, the timeline takes some time. Things are evolving on a discussion basis. This also gets harder asevents evolve. For example, recent charges in Italy against two doctors and a nurse foradministering Astra Zeneca vaccine. That creates a net new topic for our systems toneed to be able to identify and get to intervention. That's why inform - driving to authoritative sources, CIC - that's why it's so important Best way to resolve/educate individuals who aren't adversarially minded - compared to every real world event. Trying to get to fastest real solution v managing symptoms of having right information.I want to get a few minutes at the end to talk about next touch point. A lot of what Ijust said - there are also individuals that are adversarial, very good at following rules, know where the lines are, driving things off platform. Rob - I can go over 12:30 if you can. My question on inform - intellectually my bias is to kick people off. Inform, intellectually, maybe path of most impact. How are youmeasuring impact when you do inform? Is there secret sauce targeting that we canuse? Stanford has suggested building targeting tools of people that engage with antivaxcontent. - This is where it gets into Offense side, this is what Emily was talking about. How do we measure success - are we getting people vaccinated. We have metrics around how many people we're informing, how quickly, how thorough. Are weidentifying right content. Best directional metric is that symptom survey. We don'thave a strong causative way of saying because integrity did X, we now see preventing growth - we don't see that. That's why we end up in education. If we're getting at do people have more information, are they better educated, that symptom survey is bestwe have right now. Rob - that survey, you are doing treatment survey - real measure of success - did people go to center, did they read content, did that change perspective - broader integrity - unless someone tells us, hard to measure if we're changing hearts and minds, unless we do survey Rob - what are most successful inform interventions? - only a few that are very topical based right now, don't have metrics now. People have concers about methodology or safety on vaccines. We're in a test phaseon broad COVID inform treatment that drives to FB/IG. There's a post, we put informtreatment driving directly t o CIC. Not even about violating content - just broad swath.

In an ideal state, we want to get as precise as possible. The north star would be addressing each topic, but that de gree of specificity might not be something we can ever get to. So trying to go broad and wide, with a big focus on the US. Trying to push out much more information given trends we're seeing. Rob - our public campaign, largely grants, fed govt not most t rustworthy actor on vaccines - how can community organizations plug into FB in a way that will be maximally effective. Is there tooling that's coming online? - I'd love to continue this conversation - I'm not a lawyer, know we have to be sensitiv e to personal information, targeting. In terms of targeting, one of the interesting trends we've seen in my own experience - local FB Groups - city, council, regional groups giving info about when new appts are available. I'm personally seeinglocal grou p community organizing. Might be an interesting thing to look at - how are communities having those conversations - something to explore further. Rob - to Brian's point, that's the next question - how can we plug in, how can we help. W e're going to be a clearinghouse for ad campaigns, what can we bring to bear. - Action items: oChat more about how to do more targeted/communication to vulnerable communities oSymptom survey Brian - we'll put a briefing on with Curtiss, our research director. - we owe you a WA follow up Brian - we'll send that over - we'll take your queues - weekly, biweekly checkin makes sense, if you want to communicate on the fly with me and we're open Rob - probably both - let's put check in on calendar Brian - ok great, we'll put on the calendar PRODUCED TO HJC CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053284 - - -- Case: 23-30445 67 Notes on Call with White House FB Attendees: Brian Rice, - Brian: Idea today was to follow up based on meeting next week, we have- on to talk to approach to getting authoritative information,_ has some info from survey, then will go through metrics. Also want to be very clear, know you are interested in empirical information regarding success of interventions. Obviously want to get you what's helpful for you to do your job. - I need to understand a little bit. How I've interpreted -you're trying to find a causal link between someone not being exposed to vaccine hesi~t content, and therefore went out and got a vaccine. From a behavioral per~~ we don't see that. I want to make sure I understand what you're looking fo~. ~ ~ pull click through rates, other numbers, but want to confirm. Rob: Three things. We have to explain to Presideneon, p pie, why there is misinfo on the internet, bigger problem than FB. Whe~re is ues re, what interventions are, how well they are working, for products, want to e ge ings that you know to be effective. I don't even care about specific metho logy, you have better, richer data than we'll ever have. What are the thinAing hesitancy on your platform? What is it? How big is the problem? When yi!y\u00a5 rvening, how are you measuring success? I say these things because candid~,~not a lot of trust towards FB, I need to know what theory of the case is, w~r we n be most effective. I am, personally , nervous, reported that there are inte ve \u00b7o that have been done in other contexts, like NEQ score, that have been p~ . Want to make sure that you're not finding things that are effective th~t ar n't doing. - That's help I. rms of what we're doing, we look at overall universe of content on FB,(E; ed to vaccines. Some subset of that is hesitancy , some is misinfo. W~ a f March, 900,000 pieces of content was misinfo, 150,000 was US. Outside of , nu bers are really hard for us because hard to identify definitive vaccine hesit cy content. Very explicit example -40% of Marines not taking vaccine - that's being presented as fact. People are questioning government. We're struggling to identify within hesitancy content, the stuff that's nefarious , the stuff that isn't. We don't know that if we removed everything, that it would alleviate external factors. Rob: The 40% of Marines, vaccine passports , good examples. J&J. To me, the one view I have -total interactions on CrowdTangle -you have more data about who is seeing it, where's it going. We don't want to be in a position where we take down bad news. But if your goal as a company is to make it more likely that people will get the vaccine. People don't see this in only one way. Is your presupposition to do these broad things without any sense. If you're seeing something that is factual that is that kind of news, it will have a negative way in a way that it wouldn't on other platforms. CONFIDENTI AL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053291 Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 68 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 We are thinking about it the same way, we have the same challenge. We can't ask news outlets to take down bad news. That's why flooding with good information is so important. There are people that might see NYT, other trusted sources, have hesitancy. Then there's the actual trusted communities - health agencies/government/exper ts/FB, family/friends/community. In my own life, hard to get my mom to take vaccine because she thinks she already had COVID and someone else should get it. That's a weird example, removing the content prohibits discussion. How do we tone down the fervo r? Rob: Good question to be asking, you are a fervor machine. In terms of interventions, know that there are groups that are hot spots - mandatory post approvals - admins have to approve posts. If violating content approved, gives the group a strike. I'm uncovering new examples on comments - public figures on comments might be contributing more. Tomi Lahren post on how she's not getting the vaccine. Even with comment reduction, still struggling if we reduce comments from public figures, Tomi Lahren makes a post. Rob: On what basis are you finding that the public figure comments have impact? We don't have that causal link - we'd have to do a controlled study to expose people to misinformation or hesitancy content and study it. That's unethical. We can't measure that. I'd love to understand how you all are measuring that. Rob: I don't work at a company that profits on data. Hard for me to say. This is the whole problem. You guys are grading your own homework. Brian: No, working with Carnegie Mellon, we aren't seeing that. Rob: As a general practice on Facebook, you don't have a mechanism to test attitudinal impact? The impact assessment is the survey data. There's a difference between being able to set up a causal type test on our proactive measures to try to encourage vaccine uptake. The information we're putting out - we can roll out slowly and have some sense on whether it's having an impact on attitudinal measures and we do some of those tests. On the side of stuff that's misinfo, negative things propagating throughout the network. We don't have as easy an opportunity way to set up tests to determine whether people were a priori hesitant or not. We can do that for proactive work, we do research befor e we throw it out. For example, things we are sharing with communities of color, making sure not culturally insensitive. Work with organizations on brand lift tests. It's harder on the side of harmful content. Rob: If you were to change the algorithm s o that people were more likely to see NYT, WSJ, any authoritative news source over Daily Wire, Tomi Lahren, polarizing people. You wouldn't have a mechanism to check the material impact? That would require people being comfortable self- reporting change in intent to FB. One of the reasons the symptom survey is set up separately with Carnegie Mellon, UMD, because we're not under the impression that people Rob: But you cannot link product to that.

Rob: If concern is measurable attitudinal effect, there's nothing to test persuasive material on FB. Brand Lift surveys are what you sell people. We h ave the ability to do that for what FB or partners are communicating. Those are interventions that we can roll out, randomize through. When you're talking about content issues, there isn't independence of observation, material spreadingthrough the netwo rk. SUTFA (?) violations there. Difficult to estimate causal effect. Ranking changes, given the small set of the population that we don't know ahead oftime, means there is a lot of dilution, takes a lot of time to pick up that effect. Attitudes don't change immediately because of a ranking change. Have to allow time to take effect. If we made a change today, even with perfect experiment, would take a longtime. And in pandemic time, we don't have that time. That's why from product perspective, it's so important to look at mechanisms - if we can't remove it, at least we need to contain it. one piece of circumstantial evidence - we're seeing declines in vaccine hesitancy in the US similar to the decline that Census/Pulsar data is seeing. Trying toserve best data possible with others making decisions based on it. The problem is notstagnant as far as hesitancy among US FB population. It's going down. Is it going downas fast as it could? I don't have an answer. Rob: Is it going down universally? we have seen it go down among subpopulations. Are seeing a [Andy Slavitt is on the call at this point - 11:30 AM ] In Georgia, started talking about J&J halting earlier, we picked up an angle change there. Even across subpopulations, we aren't seeing it. We aren't measuringconservatives. We do look at counties and states, that are good proxies. We've beenseeing things go down until recently. Andy: Apologize I m ssed some of the beginning. A few questions on the pieces I've seen so far - is there any spillover effect on attitudes from Pfizer or Moderna vaccines? What can you tell us about what people are saying about J&J? If people are spooked bythe fact that there is a pause, I don't consider t hat misinfo, disinfo, or problematic. The vaccines are working on 9 figures of Americans. What bothers us is when data isobscured by people that mispresent it, knowingly or unknowingly. If people have legitimate concerns and questions, we want to be able to answer them. People are within their rights to react to news. We want to know the most effective way torespond to that. More broadly, feels like we're having a surprisingly tough time pinningdown a plan of action of limiting the effects of peopl e spreading misinfo on FB or WA. Question I asked 6 or 8 weeks ago - do we have or are we measuring the top, most shared negative sentiments? Are we measuring those over time? Are we taking thetime to measure the impact of them? We've heard lots of co nversation about other initiatives, a little bit of we can't do this, we can't do that. I just want to make sure thatwhen we're frustrated, we're frustrated because we can't seem to get a straight answerto what feels like a very simple question.

Going to try and work through your questions. could you speak to J&J effects? I don't know that we have spillover measurements on Moderna and Pfizer? Andy: Perfectly reasonable you wouldn't have, if you could monitor over next few days,would be great. On Moderna and Pfizer, based on guidance from Rob, trying to promote as much good as we can in CIC. can speak to J&J. Just quickly, because I think more important piece Andy is asking about is info diffusion on the platform. We are seeing an increase in vaccine hesitancy early stateswhere media had more attention, e.g., Georgia shutting down J&J earlier, so far increase in hesitancy only in Georgia. People are giving more reasons about why they are hesitant - lack of trust in govt, not sure vaccine will work, people more interested in waiting to see if vaccine is safe. We're looking to see if we can match messaging tousers to some of these concerns. For example, decline in trust in government -opportunity to push more local, authoritative people as spokespeople for information.Encouraging people not to wait and see. That doesn't answer spillover question, we'll get back to you if we have something reasonable to share that's good information. Andy: Don't wait to report to us to address spillover issues. Thank you for focusing on that. You can go onto the larger question. Want to reanchor on where we seem three biggest forms of problems: oMinority - disinfo dozen - actively pushing to remove - their patterns of behaviors have started to shift to avoid policies - for example, they are using bitly links off platform. We're looking at all their identities and removing. Arethey going to make mistakes so we can take them down? Vast minority of entities are actually maliciously intended. Andy: Clarifying q on that group Have you limited ability to share? Yes - we haven't explained that they are feature limited to them. Hard to detect content if not outright misinfo. We've taken other steps - removing amplification for Health Pages and Groups, but we don't want to remove good content or downrank re -education opportunities. Push and pull to calibrate . Andy: You don t have algorithms that can tell the difference? Our detection classifiers can find outright misinformation Andy: Those are not shareable? if we are able to identify and remove misinformation, if we can't remove, we reduce wherever we can. Andy: middle ground - how do you put caps on it. three mechanisms oWhere to put hard product features in place - e.g., mandatory post approval by admins - slows down Andy: Has that been done? yes. Another example, want to slow down the rate at which content can be produced. Good posts have bad comments. We've rate limited the amount ofcomments to slow that down. Goes back to containing when we can't remove.

What are you trying? How is it working? Andy: If you've done those things, can you measure the amount of shares of negative dis- or misinformation? Can you show us what those are? Last week it was 4%, this week it's 2%? That gives us a baseline. We recognize this is an ongoing battle. We don't know right now how big the battle is, whether we're winning or losing. Then we're able to not flail around and begin to focus with you on how to make it better. Isthat possible to produce some kind of report? Before you got here - we can pull raw numbers. Those will not necessarily correlate with attitudinal changes. Because this is real world, we will see the numbersfluctuate. For example, with J&J, may see spikes. Andy: So if you told me, we've gone from 3% to 2% but it hasn't changed attitudes.That's all we want; you control what you can control. Someday , there could be bad info about Pfizer, we have to answer honestly. FB isn't accountable for that. FB isaccountable for people getting truth ful, reliable information, not content that subtly changes. I just want to reinforce a lot of what Rob has been saying. It would make a lot of our lives easier if when we delete content, we change minds. When we talk about constraint, that's the best thing we can measure. We'vehad a lot of policy conversations, don't want to go back to that. This is hard from technical and policy perspective. How to get the right information to the right people toget people vaccinated. Andy: Happy to think through challenges with you. Depends on who is sending message -in mainstream newspaper that's reliable, one thing, if comments that aren't, someone with a misleading story. Drudge report had a headline yesterday - 6/7 million cases of J&J have problem - total disaster. Together, someone coming on that news for the first time gets the intended effect. In terms of scale, that would make me nervous too. The technical challenge, building Andy: We care about posts shared the most. Can ask one question - what I'm hearing is - give us a better sense of raw numbers - those might flip and won't show sentiment. We want to hear what we can do better - for J&J - communities in rural areas, MI, potentially more likely to take J&J. I don't know the best way to go about reaching them. Would love to hear from yourside how your campaign is reaching people so we can build into product. Andy: over long term, if you believe govt/expert agencies put transparency and safety first, will pay off. If people get accurate information, feel comfortable that someone watching backs. Worries about being rushed are not as true. Black community - got very good feedback from black physicians, black activists. At the same time, people inconservative community , just as we were getting people off the edge, now people more likely to say right all along. If people do their own homework, we ought to trust them.Not everyone will choose to get a vaccine. If people can make own decisions, we'll getover 80%. But worried about people being unduly influenced. I just want to be clear that attitudinal shift data on misinfo doesn't exist.

If there are other things you want to get ou t, we'd love to see that to help inform people. Rob: I obviously care about attitudinal shifts, matters to me. I still feel like I don't know what you are doing, what the metrics of success are. What are the 10 things you've tried? to be fair, we are tracking that. Reduced VPVs, reduced ranking. What I can't give is attitudinal shift. That's the first time I'm hearing in those terms. That would begreat for us to provide. We have hard policy constraints - things like Tomi Lahren's post. Just want to be clear we haven't declared victory. Andy: If you added to that policy changes you are considering, that would be helpful aswell. I will tell you this just to have Rob's back, he gets asked this, it's becoming thenumber one question. I would just ask you not to put him in a position where he sayshe doesn't know. Better if he can say here's what the data says here's what they'redoing, this is what they are working on. Completely hear that. If I'm frustrated, it's because we want to achieve the same things. What we can give you is data. Andy: I appreciate you being honest. I think it will be challenging for Rob to saythat FB team is frustrated too. That kind of reaction would not go over well. We haveto get pa st that. To be extremely clear, reason I'm frustrated is not because it's a big problem, it's because it's moving so fast. The 40% Marines - that's coming from a community already hesitant. Comes from care. Rob: Maybe I haven't been able to a rticulate - what do you need from me to get the information you need? Brian: We'll develop a report get you data. We don't want to send something that will be frustrating. We've got a good sense, from what Andy has told us on this call would be most he lpful - data picture. We will and can get you a report, Andy. We've been struggling to get you a usable dataset. Rob: Can we drill down on that. I don't need we saw 5% lift over X. I need - we tried XYZ, this is what seems to be working. What did you try? What is scaling? What was ineffective or political bullshit. Then a sense of what now. Andy: What Rob just asked for, complements the data. Do get the sense that this isn't a social media wide problem, it's unique to FB and WA. Conversations are not as challenging - we have much more straightforward conversations with others. I think people believe you can solve it. Simplify to here's what's going on, here's what'sworking. this is my third meeting - Rob, we can pull that on the interventions.

Want to understand how we're working with you in a different way than others. Rob: I feel like we're running around in circles.

I'm doubting that you are telling us everything or that you aren't getting the resources you need to tackle this. Of 1% of vaccine info, this is what's concerning, this is who is seeing it, this is what we're doing. Super helpful, appreciate the feedback. When I say want things from you all, just to improve our process. One example - we can't do race targeting. Using SVI. Andy: I've jumped into 3 or 4 FB conversations; each one has been almost exactly the same. I've asked the same questions with Rob. They all finish the same way. Goodpromise at the end.

Brian: It's been 2 -3 weeks, kn ow Nick told you we'd be working on reporting. We'll get that to you ASAP. I think Nick said at the time it would take some time to figure out. What helps me is understanding is it doesn't have to be qualitative. On the metrics - the most viral content is the authoritative content - I thought that wouldn't be useful. We'll look for faster qualitative bunch along with product info. Rob: Two reasons why not useful - we see it in CrowdTangle. I don't know if widest reach stuff is the problem, or stuff that's in groups, private. Answer hasn't changed oDisinfo dozen style people staying under policy limits oAuthoritative post s with comments and dialogues Rob: What that implies to me that you think there's not a problem. So, tell me what is. If it's far reaching authoritative but bad news. That's why we didn't send it. I don't have the numbers on comments but pulling. The last thing that s evolving - public figures Rob: concept of disinfo dozen is concerning - is it impact or subjective? subjective - reason it makes me nervous - how do we stay below these lines. Maybe misspoke when I said frustration - relates to nuance and extent of the problem. I want to work with you on these things - scrappier faster data Brian: Thanks Rob.

I lead a special methodology team -De~afhY and Survey Science. I'm a sociologist by training. The survey that we'r~r ~ith CMU and UMD -using FB's superpower in combination with superp er public health community to understand at a granular level issues. W~i ublic health experts to help with what goes into survey, we aren't public h~th ~erts. In the US alone, we collect about 40,000 responses per day.

I can go i~~1 vel insights by race/ethnicity/age etc., hear about. High level things m t p tI ent: real time info on preventative ~e ior. But want to address what you want to o We've all heard in them nd other data sources about disparities among people of color v.-_,,.,,.,u,,... \u00b7 es with respect to hesitancy. This survey points out that vaccine ace tin black and LatinX adults are less likely to have attempted to make an ~W ent. In LatinX community , highest gap in MD, NY, VA. MD -dispare\u00b7 t~n LatinX and white adults is largest -interesting because MD is oi e st hesitant states. State like NM, much older Latino population, act I n between white population and Latino population there. o States here most hesitant -Ml, Indiana, Ohio -reasons people are giving -side effects, waiting to see what happens, lack of trust. In other states, a lot of diversity across the US. Nice thing about this data is you can dive in at a county level to see how the numbers are changing over time so you can think about potential interventions. o Another highlight -looking at real time preventative health behaviors. E.g., Texas with no mask mandate -we can look before and after lifting mask mandate on March 10. 3% decrease in people reporting wearing masks. We see heterogeneity across counties.

That allows us to be able to understand the c hanges occurring as pandemic is unfolding. o Change instrument frequently, in 7 languages. o Would love to answer questions, what you'd like to see. Brian: Rob, you heard from that we're using survey to get feedback and see in the real world how peo ple are responding. View it as a valuable tool. Would love feedback on how could use it. We have a new version coming to you next week. Have collaborated with CDC, gotten a lot of good feedback, a lot of interest from academic community. Zeke Emmanuel just co -published an article looking at self - modulated behaviors in response to rising case rates. Rob: In terms of the survey, when gleaning things from it, how do you compare population on FB against general population? About 93% of adults in the US use the internet, about 83 84% on FB. We have more data about people on FB than people on survey panels. People don't join FB to take surveys, orthogonal w/r/t bias. Some slight skews, but we think we do pretty well. The value of the da ta isn't that there isn't bias, it's that he bias is consistent over time. If you want to understand over time across geographies, we can offer that better than anyone else. Rob: First packet I got in mid -March, was results from February, was useful. I'm curious, what are messaging things that are most useful. What are you finding that has worked? We haven't engaged with our own interventions, we're rolling that out, it's early to say. You'll recall, we're doing a lot of broad inform, we felt we didn't have the right targeting in place to go deep One thing I want to make sure we're not losing, any subtext - how do we enable you to find the communities that need the more targeted messaging? Rob: we want to find where is the biggest problem, what has been materially useful. Survey itself can tell you the reasons that hesitant but persuadable are being influenced by norms and expectations of people around them in their lives. You can see at a geographic level the difference s. But you can also see who they trust. Those also vary by geography and population. If you take that - can explore local messengers in one community, friends and family in another, more elite spokesperson is another. It can help you with the messaging, but you have to try it to see if works. It's hard for us to prove out that an informative piece of content changes hearts and minds outside of survey. Social norms, like profile frames, seeing friends and family and public figures, could help. So when 28% people of NH saying they are waiting because other people need it more, then maybe you need to match message to not to wait. Almost like political microtargeting. Rob: How do we make that operationally useful for us and track it?

Brian: We will push to get more frequent versions of this, can also look for red alert,COVID survey concierge service, will look at what we can provide. want to see what survey can tell WH about where people are hesitant and how we get messages tothem. Then also on FB to counter misinfo through labeling, pushing authoritative info topeople. That's something we're making a priority. Courtney: Super helpful to get this information, this is what we need. What we need ishelp pushing back on the myths. Doesn't just help us understand how and where to intervene, but it also tells us if the interventions are working. We can see overtime if hesitancy is decreasing where we are doing interventions. Rob: Rather than chasing individual narratives/demographics, know you've said thatbroad access is more of philosophical approach. Don't think that targe ting is the wrong way to do it, it's a sequencing thing. Remove harm, reduce hesitant, inform good. In an ideal state, we inform, but we canalso identify and reduce hesitant. But since the detection still isn't quite there for hesitancy, we are startin g with inform. Maturity of our detection is the core of challenge for identifying and removing and also means harder to do more targeted interventions. Rob: Question I have - if we focus on broad stuff next - if we are to take things from more targeted info, we run targeted ads and local media. You can look at what'sshowing promise, what's in the lab. Yes - right now, it's all broad.

We are looking at using CDC SVI to see if we're having a more or less positive effects on those counties that are considered as vulnerable by CDC. Can we bring together behavioral aspects of what we see. Not building two different tools, building one, market the same one to different people. Can we bring Katie next time, Brian? This is at the heart of biggest opportunity to work together. Brian: Yes. Rob: Is the problem that there isn't a tool? Or the more someone uses FB, the morelikely to be vaccine hesitant? Don't think we have data that suggests that. Literature on vaccine hesitancy - people bring hesitancy to the groups that they are in. They aren't more hesitant as aresult of social media campaigns. Do think that for some populations - not knowing how to get an appointment is actually a barrier. FB can help meet that need. For other populations, might have a more effective message. Vaccine hesitant, anti -vaxxers. We can address concerns of vaccine hesitant by understanding concerns and address. Remove harm - about trying to actively do harm - that's the vast minority but we want to remove. Hesitancy - want to keep get ing as much information as I can to you. Vast majority of overall widely distributed content, authoritative and good - from CDC, etc. Hesitancy themes around side effects - is vaccine causing nose bleeds, enlarged lymph nodes. We still have a gap in understanding or managing expectationsas to what experience could be like. Another thing - lots of questions over finding appointment. Seeing a trend in memes and satire making fun of individuals that don't want to get vaccine. Political themes: video of Biden speaking, reactions. Still smallgroup of adversarial people, large group who are hesitant and have concerns about s ide effects, finding appointments. Rob: Are you able to provide esources? This is why on broad inform - we tag anything with COVID- 19 vaccine, it directs you to the COVID information center. Ideal state - I have a concern about a nosebleed, here's a resource exactly about that. That from a technical perspective is really hard, which is why it s broader. It's hard, and it may not be effective. Some research shows that allowing people to express experience and concerns might be a more effective path to having aconversation with them. Have to be careful in how we approach. Rob: If people are having the conversation, is the presumption that we let people have it. Direct them to CDC. What then? I think it's an and. We all know people that have had the experience that think that FB is listening to them. The more general stuff, connection to CDC, pops up as very predictable, that's fine, people don't have issues with that. You have the opportunity togo back later, to surface information. At the immediate moment, have the big brotherfeel. We should pay attention to those conversations, make sure that people see information, even if it's not right then. Have easy access to information.

We can send you an example of what it looks like. Rob -how many times does the Page have to share to trigger treatment? --It varies across experiences. In this case, I think it's 5. Let me follow up specifically. Want to make sure you have the most accurate information. Rob - I'm curious about notifications after sharing something fact-checked. In many different worlds ago, Brian and I talked about -the CW said it hardens people. What changed? What research have you done? CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTIO N MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-11 I can't speak to what was discussed earlier. These experiences have been being built for quite som e time, have evolved. We've refined user research that told us that people do pay attention, there is value in providing this information, even if it's after the fact. Brian, any other context? Brian - was this around the election? Rob - this is when we first talked on Beto stuff - badging, notifying people. Research said counterproductive. I think this is a good thing. Brian - I do remember that was our sense at the time - going back after the time. Let me go back to the teams and see. - We have pivoted substantially in the couple years I've been here towards a much more inform-centric approach. Another experience we launched last year - when a person goes to share an out-of-date piece of content or one likely to have misinfo in it, we surface what we call a reshare interstitial that informs people at time of sharing that content might be out of date. We found that as classifiers have improved over time, we've been able to be more targeted in approach, that type of information has quite materially slowed the spread of viral misinformation. A lot of this was over time improving our ability to classify, getting the copy and experience right - informative but not judgmental. Saying likely to be problematic in XYZ ways, you choose if you reshare. We notify you there might be some issues. - external studies in this space are heterogenous in their effects. Quality of classifier really matters in prompts, even if after the fact. Also, nature of the topic itself. Tone in which you approach it matters quite a bit. One of those situations where it works sometimes, it's not going to work all the time. You have to test and adjust it. I'm sure that improving classifier over time is what's making this work. - and getting the tone right is also a key factor. Can influence whether pause before sharing. Rob - Tone is way copy is written? - right. We spent months of time landing the precise copy where we wouldn't be perceived as being paternalistic Landing the words was really important. We launched the first ones in March/April last year have now used during election periods, other scenarios. It's a powerful lever against misinformation. Rob - Cool, awesome - I love this approach specifically because we are transparent with users. Demotion work - it is difficult to be transparent, give people a sense of how their content is being enforced on. In this case, able to be transparent and clear about the fact that the content will get less distribution, fewer people are going to see it. Rob - that makes sense. - Ok, I'll just cover context-setting COVID approach. We remove content that clearly violates our policies. Then there is a set of content that doesn't violate but could be harmful, and so important to reduce the amount of times content is seen. Won't spend much more time on that if that works for you. Rob - OK - I can spend a minute on how ranking works. Demotions, in their simplest form, is a discount to a ranking score that we assign to a piece of content. Zooming out a bit - there is so much content out there - each person has more inventory than they could possibly ever go PRODUCED TO HJC CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053299 - - - -- - - - Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 84 Date Filed: 08/07/2023through. Ranking is important because it's important to order what people see. Rank based on user value - determined by signals. What you might want to see most versus what I might want to see most. What we do is take all these different signals, assign a ranking score to a piece of content. Say there is a piece of sensationalist content, vaccine related. We assign a value - say it's 10 - given all the different things we incorporate into ranking score. Our integrity system then calculates an integrity score or multiplier. In the case of sensationalist content - we're certain that this piece of content is correctly classified as such - sensationalist content gets a demotion strength or discount of 40%/0.4. - we subtract 4 from 10. Piece of content that would have otherwise had a ranking score of 10 now has a rank of 6. So, when we stack rank or order the content after applying integrity score determines where it goes. Tricky piece is that ranking systems are deeply personalized. Difficult to say that a piece of content will rank in X position in everyone's feed universally. Not how it works. But I can say this piece of content would be seen by roughly 40% fewer people based on demotion. That's one way to think about the \"under the hood\" of demotion works. Rob - this is interesting. If seen by 40% fewer people, who are the remaining 60%? What are the audience differentiations? What kind of person can see it? - this is where the personalized nature of news feed comes in (and note I'm talking conceptually, it may not be precisely 60/40). One example is a low inventory user. So, if my dad only has 4 friends, there's limited content for him to see Another reason - connected to a page or group. Or if someone is scrolling deeper into feed than you or I might do. Rob - Reason I ask - seems plausible that 40% that are no longer seeing it are less susceptible to it and 60% are more open to it. Attitudinal difference. - I think that's right - although we can't say who it's bad for, or whether their attitudes are antecedent. Brian - Thinking about that population - I ve been asking the same questions - you'd have the 40% might be the fence sitters. The remainder may have signal that they want to see it - they're not fence sitters. They are the folks that won't be convinced. There's an argument that you're removing it from fence sitter I don't think we have data to show it. Rob - Devil in the details It's hard for me to make a personal evaluation of whether it's making a difference. - If we wanted to understand if it's making a difference, we'd have to randomly assign who gets demotion and who doesn't and have some sense of prior attitudes. Given that this is a rare event. That random assignment becomes harder when you're talking about content that others inject into the system versus our ability to inject content. With vaccines, it's probably not exposure to one thing or exposure over a short time. At the point of the pandemic where we're talking about vaccines, people have hardened/crystalized their attitudes. Hard to study. On integrity - we hope they are effective, taking steps because we don't want the content up. And then there are times where we are actively putting things at the top of people's feed. In that case, we control random assignments and can look at differences. - two other things. 60/40 - don't want to anchor in them, they are arbitrary. Could have used X and Y . This is where inform treatments become important. People who might want to see that content will continue to see it.

People can choose to engage. But in parallel, we're providing a counter to that misinformation. Does that make sense? Rob - It makes sense. You guys are much longer on inform, we're much longer on reduce. - what do you mean by that? Rob - we're keen on what platforms are doing to reduce the spread of bad information, that platforms are not funneling people towards bad content. That's our primary concern. If you guys have data that show that inform counteracts the spread of bad information, great. - it does. The value of inform is that we know that it does have an impact on distribution. Rob - I'd love to see that. - particularly important for borderline content where difficult for classifiers. - a couple data points that have been really helpful for me. Search interstitial. I think we have data that interstitials do reduce borderline and misinfo shares. It's a clear example of interstitial having a meaningful impact. Other data we have goes one step further - proactive campaigns with CDC and so on. Able to measure causal and in some cases positive impact on vaccine attitudes. Another example of value of inform. Rob - I haven't seen that data. - as with all marketing campaigns, depends on targeting and copy. More than happy to share. - some of them were in Nick's email. Rob - that was my last thing I wanted to get at with Brian. We came away that you weren't measuring, then we saw that you were. Was that brand lift? How are you measuring? - Measured in a few ways. A lot of the ones in Nick's note were brand lift or analogous (compare people exposed to content to random control group and survey). That's one of the techniques we've used. In addition to that, have done additional studies to try to attribute to real world uptake. Those take longer. Blood donations is a good example - when we rolled out in the US worked closely with American Red Cross - we were able to see with their data - increase of 19% increase nationwide of new donors. Using same techniques in this space. Direct brand lift, then broader body of work that goes all the way to attribution in the physical world. - I have to hop, Rob happy to follow up with whatever details might be helpful. There is some upcoming work on increased transparency that would love to chat with you about sometime in the future. Rob - Great, thank you. - We are able to do causal inference/impact analyses. The conversation we had previously was how can we understand impact of misinfo on people's attitudes. That's where we have a hard time studying. Rob - that makes sense. I actually do have to run also. I still have more questions, can email them to you Brian. Brian - great. As mentioned, we are doing more as a Company to try and make this easier to understand. Coming in the next couple weeks. We can follow up with you then. But send questions, we'll do our best. Rob - also interested outside of COVID in promotion of good information - NEQ score stuff rings a lot of alarm bells. Would like to dive in next time we talk.

E.g., RFK Jr.'s IG Account is removed, so his FB Page will be non-recommendable.* Recommendation: We recommend this as a stop-gap measure specifically targeting Disinfo Dozen assets. Perthe recent Avaaz < https://secure.avaaz.org/campaign/en/fb_algorithm_antivaxx/ > report, some entities affiliated with removed Disinfo Dozen Pages are still being recommended because they do not have recent violations.* Difficulty: Low (1-6 weeks) 1. Option 2a. Count COVID M&H, Vaccine WDH, & COVID RFH toward misinfo Repeat Offender Status * Impact: Currently, strikes for COVID Misinfo & Harm, Vaccine Widely Debunked Hoaxes, and COVID Repeatedly Fact-Checked Hoaxes receive Community Standards strikes, but they do not count towardsMisinformation Repeat Offender (RO) Status. If we count those strikes towards Misinfo RO Status, entities spreading COVID or vaccine misinfo would more quickly receive related penalties, such as content demotion or anadvertising ban, on top of normal CS penalties.* Recommendation: We recommend this because the Misinfo RO system is meant to penalize misinfo actors andtherefore should count this content,which is more egregious than false inform tion f ct-checked by a 3PFC.* Difficulty: Low (1-6 weeks) Option 2b. Develop a strike system for health-related Partly False and Missing Context ratings that could trigger domain/Page/Group/account Repeat Offender (RO) status in more instances [Note: leadership feedback is todevelop this for DOMAINS only] * Impact: Our latest analysis of URLs directing to Disinfo Dozen webpages found that a significant percentage of the most viewed URLs have Partly False or M ssing Context 3PFC ratings. Counting health-related Partly Falseand Missing Context ratings toward entity-level penalties could allow us to take stronger action to reduce thedistribution of the domains and associated entities themselves.* Recommendation: We recommend this as it is consistent with the precedent of taking stronger measuresagainst Covid-related fact-checked cont nt However, this requires considerable lift for just a small set of badactors.* Difficulty: High (6+ weeks)* In the interim, we could demote in-Feed domains associated with removed entities (note: three are already exper encing demotion under Misinfo RO penalties).

Context: Leadership asked Misinfo Policy and a couple of teams on Product Policy to brainsto1m some additional policy levers we can pull to be more aggressive against Covid and vaccine misinfonnation . This is stemming from the continued criticism of our approach from the US administration and a desire to kick the tires finiher intemally on creative options. (We know there's also a parallel effo1t to brainsto1m Product/BTG levers we can pull.) We've been sprinting over the past several days and have both dusted off some ideas we'd previously discussed with our Product counte1prut s (ie you), and come up with some net new ideas.

N From: b.com> Sent: PRIV] Rice com>; b.com>; Brian Rice b.com>;\u00ad b.com>; This email provides a follow-up to our August 6th discussion regarding our res ~ Surgeon General on COVID-19 misinformation. During that discussion, we agreed to further explor r creet policy options for reducing the prevalence of COVID-19 misinformation on our platforms . the teams have scoped the requirements for executing those options. As discussed further below to roll-out the first three o tions over the next comin weeks and will roll-out the fourth o tion as an nl Please let us know if you have any concerns with the fo~lo ing pla y 9 am ET tomorrow; otherwise, we plan to provide an update to the Surgeon General and start ec \u00b7ng against these tomorrow. Thankyoo , ~ 1. Option 1: Designate any assets lin~ed Us/Pages/Profiles/Accounts, which have been removed for COVID misinfo violations, as n rec mendable to users. a. Impact: Any asset linked -ages/Profiles/Accounts that have been removed for COVID misinfo violations would be r commended to users (e.g., RFK Jr.'s IG Account is removed, so his FB Page will be non-r. able). b. Status: By the end this eek, we will enforce on approximately 60 linked assets related to the Disinfo Dozen~ en removed for COVID misinfo violations. Over the next three weeks, we will enga e I work to understand how to mitigate the risk of over-enforcement here. We will then r~f further recommendat ion on a broader policy change that will affect more than just the 60 Dis~oze1r-linked assets. 2. Option 2: Count COVID Misinformation & Harm (M&H), Vaccine Widely Debunked Hoaxes (WDH), & COVID Repeatedly Fact-Checked Hoaxes (RFH) toward Misinformation Repeat Offender status. a. Impact: Currently, only 3PFC-rated False/Altered content counts toward misinfo repeat offender status, which results in demotions and demonetization for entities. Counting COVID M&H, Vaccine WDH, and COVID RFH strikes towards misinfo repeat offender status would more quickly penalize entities spreading COVID or vaccine misinfo on top of our normal Community Standards penalties. b. Status: We are targeting the end of September for launch. This includes updating language on existing transparency surfaces to notify affected entities how content we remove for COVIDNaccine violations factors into their Repeat Offender status. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTIO N MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-11 3: Demote COVID or vaccine misinformati on rated Partly False more strongly. a. Impact: We currently demote content rated Partly False at 50%. We will increase that demotion level to 80% for COVID and vaccine misinfo. Note: In the last month, fact-checkers applied \"Partly False\" ratings to at least 1k COVID-19 /vaccine content. b. Status: We are targeting the end of next week for launch. This includes transparency updates in an existing NewsRoom Post (link). 4. Option 4: Count COVID or vaccine-related URLs that are rated Partly False or Missing Context towards \"domain \" Repeat Offender (RO) status (i.e., penalize the URL domains from which the content was shared). a. Impact: The Disinfo Dozen report faulted FB for allowing users to share URLs linked to the Disinfo Dozen. Misinfo Policy found that, for the most viral Disinfo Dozen URLs rated by third-party fact checkers, 85% of those ratings were either Partly False or Missing Context However, only False ratings count towards misinfo repeat offender status, which means, for those URLs rated False, all user shares of that U RL's domain will be demoted. b. Status: i. Change: This is a heavy lift to integrate into our existing repeat offender system. Instead, we will approach this as an on-escalation break-the-g lass measure. We will periodica lly manually review domains that had a high number of third-party fact check ratings to see if enough of them were COVID or vaccine related. We will enforce on domains that meet that threshold manually for 90-day domain demotion (note: threshold is still TBD). Misinfo P~y a d Product are ii.

We could amend our Help Center to prohibit Groups and Pages from using coded language to discuss COVID and vaccines if there is evidence that they intend to avoid detection (we believe there is such evidence here --see post below where they are teaching members how to use code words). On #3, we reviewed 28 websites linked to the \"Disinfo Dozen\" and found that 15 prominently feature content that would violate our COVID/vaccine misinfo policies, or would be borderline vaccine discouraging, if they were on our platform. Of those 15, >50% of the recent shares of 2 of those domains would violate our policies if on platform; 25-50% of the recent shares of 6 of those domains would violate our policies; and <25% of the recent share of 7 of those domains would violate our policies.

THx N We should take stock after the Fri meeting, but my sense is that our current course -in effect explaining ourselves more fully, but not shifting on where we draw the lines or on the data we5vide (subject to the agreement last night that we'd offer up VPVs of content we've removed but only dem nded from other platforms on the same basis) is a recipe for protracted and increasing acrimo~ WH as the vaccine roll out continues to stutter through the Fall and the Winter.

N From: ~ > Date: Wednesday , July 21, 2021 at 8:35 PM Subject: Covid misinfo: Delta assessment + Mitigations Nick, TLDR: There is likely a significant gap between what the WH would like us to remove and what we are comfortable removing. There are some policy mitigations that could get the two parties closer. but Content Policy does not recommend pursuing them. You asked for information about the delta between content that Face book is removmg ~th White House wants us to remove and m1tigat1on options The White House rarely provides any sp~1 1ty out what 11 wants removed, but it routinely complains to us about content identified 111 critical n:di~: s e've compiled specific cntic1sms and extrapolated from more general complamts below\u00b7 ~ , for child safety and dangerous organization v1olat1ons . b. Mitigation (not recommended) : We could remove all o person's groups/pages/accounts once they have had a single group/page/account~-o d for covid misinfo violations. This would remove approximately 50 non-violating~\u00b7t1 as ciated with the Disinfo Dozen. including many entities that have nothing to do with CO \u00b7 r ines. We are continuing to research what other entities might be affected. c. Background : r ~ i. Jen Psaki said t t ~ banned on one platform, you shoud be banned on all platforms. We do an itlla not ban users from FB or IG because they've been banned by compe \u00b7 W assess FB pages and profiles and IG accounts based on the content they po an o ot typically enforce against a non-violating page/profile/account if a connecte~i \u00b7s moved (we only enforce cross-platform on DOI and Child Safety violations) his tice has been a point of contention around the \"Disinfo Dozen\" beca~ av removed their violating entities (23 entities from 11 of the 12 people) but conr a low their non-violating entities (53 entities -this set is under constant review er changes often). 2. Off-Platform Li a. Delta The ants all links to the Disinfo Dozen's off-platform domains removed. We only remove links to off-p m content if the content violates child safety or dangerous organizations violations. b. Mitigation (not recommended): We could remove all posts from FB/IG if the posts contain a link to domains associated with covid misinfo violators, but it would likely remove significant amounts of benign content posted by regular users, such as their posts about person experiences or governmen t criticism that also include a link to a website. Some of the off-FB/IG websites also have non-covid-related content, so we could be removing posts that are not about COVID and link to the websites for non-COVID reasons. It is unlikely that we have capacity to review individual off-platform links, so we would likely have to execute at a domain level. c. Background : i. To get to the claim that 65% of covid misinfo comes from the Disinfo Dozen, we assume the WH CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTIO N MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053714 Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 108 Date Filed: 08/07/2023CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053715 PRODUCED TO HJCis complaining about non-violating content on FB that includes links to content off FB that would violate if posted on FB. ii. We could blackhole links to any domain or sub-domain associated with pages, groups, or accounts removed for violating our covid misinfo policies. We are currently investigating the impact that this change would have, including both scope of removals and how much of the content would be benign. Given resource constraints, we do not think it is feasible to review all pages before removal. iii. We are still collecting information on how much content this would remove and a rough estimate of what percentage of that content links to benign versus violating content. 1. True information: a. Delta: The Surgeon General wants us to remove true information about side effects if the user does not provide complete information about whether the side effect is rare and treatable. We do not recommend pursuing this practice. b. Mitigation (not recommended): We currently label all of this content and demote some of it. We could remove the content or increase the demotion strength. c. Background: i. The Surgeon General's report on misinformation defines misinformation as including: \"An anecdote about someone experiencing a rare side effect after a routine surgery. The specific anecdote may be true but hide the fact that the side effect is very rare and treatable. By misinforming people about the benefits and risks of the surgery, the anecdote can be highly misleading and harmful to public health.\" ii. Experts have advised us that it's important to allow people to ask questions and allow open discussion of vaccine safety and efficacy to overcome vaccine hesitancy. For content that is presented in a sensational or shocking way or promotes vaccine refusal, we demote the content and apply a label with a link to accurate, authoritative information. We believe the information push partially combats the incomplete information while giving users space to express their views and share their personal experiences. 1. Other Vaccine Hesitant Content: a. Delta: The WH generally objects to content that appears in media criticism of our covid misinfo efforts. While we don't have specifics, we can extrapolate that they would like us to remove content that provides any negative information on or opinions about the vaccine without concluding that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh that information or opinion; humorous or satirical content that suggests the vaccine isn't safe b. Mitigation: Similar to true information, we recommend adhering to expert advice that we allow open discussion of vaccine safety and efficacy and do not recommend removing this content. We could consider increasing the demotion strength on content being demoted that is still breaking through into top posts. c. Background: i. We reviewed a recent report, titled t.\u00a7!.\u00a3gJ2Qi2JS...!J\u00a7JL\u00a7!..::J..E:~~..illlfilr:l!Q\u00a3[0'Q.r'Q!1gm\"\"1m, that concluded 12 of the top 15 vaccine-related posts on Facebook in a one-month period were \"negative.\" We replicated the report's Crowdtangle search to review the content. None of the content or users relate to the \"Disinfo Dozen.\" Of note, in order to maintain the narrative of FB's failure, our critics remove UNICEF content from their analysis because it effectively dominates covid content --an accurate report on covid content from this Crowdtangle search would show that 5 of the top 15 posts were authoritative, pro-vaccine posts from UNICEF. ii. None of the content should have been removed. Five pieces of content labeled \"negative\" are being demoted for being vaccine hesitant. Six pieces of content labeled \"negative\" are non-violating --one is an ABC News report; two are personal opinions opposing mask and vaccine mandates; and two are personal opinions about the speaker's decision not to get vaccinated. Four pieces of content are labeled \"positive\" or \"neutral.\" There is a full content assessment below. Detailed Assessment of Other Vaccine Hesitant Content: 1. The #2 ranked content is an ABC News report about side effects. It is deemed \"negative.\" a. Delta assessment: We don't know whether the WH would propose that this reporting from network news should be removed for accurately reporting on side effects. We do not recommend doing so. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 109 Date Filed: 08/07/2023CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053716 PRODUCED TO HJC1. Five pieces of content (ranking 1, 5, 7, 13, 14) were borderline content and were demoted and labeled, but the demotion strength did not remove them from the top 100 FB posts for the relevant time period. All received the label: \"COVID-19 vaccines go through many tests for safety and effectiveness and are then monitored closely\" with a link to FB's COVID-19 Information Center. a. Delta assessment (content assessment below): We suspect the WH believes this content should be removed. We demote and label this content because we find it irresponsible in its sensationalism and lack of context; however, it is a mix of true content and criticism of the government, both of which are appropriate to allow on platform. b. #1, 5, and 7 are from Candace Owens and suggest that the vaccine is experimental or has side effects, including death, and are critical of the government. #5 was also fact-checked by a 3PFC. c. #13 is from Tucker Carlson and offers sensationalized reporting on a true incident of a 12 year old suffering a rare side effect and and reporting on a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics about the dangers of wearing masks to children. The content was posted the day after the JAMA study was published. JAMA retracted the study two weeks after publication. d. #15 is from Turning Point USA and suggests that the government has no authority to mandate taking an experimental vaccine. 1. Five pieces of content (ranking 4, 6, 8, 11, 12) were labeled negative. a. Delta assessment (content assessment below): The WH has previously indicated that it thinks humor should be removed if it is premised on the vaccine having side effects, so we expect it would similarly want to see humor about vaccine hesitancy removed. We don't have insight into whether the WH wants personal opinions about government mandates or explanations of personal choices not to get the vaccine removed. We believe there is a strong interest in protecting the expression of personal opinion and personal choice. b. #4 is a cartoon attempt at humor, suggesting that door-to-door vaccinators would be tied to trees. c. The other four pieces of content all offer personal opinions about mask or vaccine mandates or the decision to be vaccinated. 1. Four pieces of content (ranking 3, 9, 10, 15) were labeled positive or neutral. Disinfo Dozen Status On Platform: 1. We have been aware of the Disinfo Dozen back in March. We took very aggressive actions based on them, and other entities we flagged, by expanding the amount of Misindo that we remove and by giving the \"Worst of the Worst\" entities 48 hours to remove all violating misinformation or otherwise they would be removed. As a result of that, we removed known anti-vaxxers such as RFK Jr.'s IG Account. 2. This resulted in behavior modification by these actors --RFK stopped posting anti-vax content on his FB page, and some other members of the Disinfo Dozen also stopped posting violating content. 3. We have continued to monitor these accounts and have found the following: a. 91 entities are tied to the Disinfo Dozen (however, the majority of these entities do not share anti-vax content and some post infrequently or stopped posting altogether). b. 23 of those entities have been removed. c. We are confirming additional entities (approx. 15) that may be removed under our \"Single Use Multiple Account\" and Recidivism policies (we are aiming to have these results by EOD). d. 11 of the 12 Disinfo Dozen members have had one entity removed by us.

Dr. Murthy has been clear that we're really calling for an all- society approach - individuals, organizations, technology can do, especially with respect to misinformation. We know this is a broader issue for society. Health Advisory is one of the tools for SG's office. We have commitments from Rockefeller Foundation, other organizations, in response to SG's call for action Before we go further, want introduce Kyla. Kyla: I'm leading SG's work on health misinformation, including the Advisory. We're excited to walk through some pieces of it today. I was previously CIO for US Census Bureau, stood up work on misinformation there. Nice to meet you all, good to be here. We set up calls with as many stakeholders as possible who were mentioned in the Advisory. Want to go through at a high level. o To reiterate - Advisory is one of three tools that SG has to call public attention to an issue of concern. A report is longer, multi- year effort, hundreds of pages, on a topic with a lot of literature and substantial evidence base - for well- established health issues. Then you al o have a call to action, 20 -50-page document, around a topic. In the middle. Advisory is a shor ter document - calling attention to an emergent issue for public health. Just adding some context, most folks, including myself a year ago, might not be familiar. o As Eric mentioned earlier, wanted to be very intentional about a whole of society approach. Called out stakeholder groups of particular importance, individuals/families, educators, health professionals, technology platforms, researchers, government (list incomplete, see advisory for full list). o First parts of the document set the stage - lay the groundwork for how we got here. Second page - unique to SG Advisory - we call out specific actions and recommendations. Let me move through and skip forward to tech platforms. o If you hadn't had a chance to review the section on tech platforms, would be great to do so. Everything rooted in evidence -base, in conjunction with experts we consulted. Wanted to find middle ground of interventions and solutions that are doable but meaningful. What we wanted to address here are not just the low -hanging fru it but things that could create systemic impact over the long term. But not so visionary that are not able to be implemented. Happy to talk through any of those pieces. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053609 PRODUCED TO HJC ------ Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 112 Date Filed: 08/07/2023o Just jumping to conclusion - message that we really wanted to drive home - speed and scale at which misinformation is spreading is truly unprecedented and it's having quantifiable impacts on COVID response. Wanted to make that clear. We do think we're in a unique circumstance - what WHO calls infodemic - that needs to be addressed. let's recircle back on questions but would love to hear more about specifics. Kyla: sounds good. Eric: I know you flagged the 4 action items from Jen Psaki's remarks. I don't know if you want to walk through those, what your current stance is on those, anything you might be doing in response to call to action, we'd love to hear that. Great, that would be a helpful discussion. Will turn it over to and our team. Happy to discuss and start with the four points. The overall recommendations on what technology platforms can do - we're broadly aligned, make a lot of sense. We'd love to work together. Excited about that as one area of discussion, anticipate it will be ongoing, working to build shared understanding of solution s pace. Would also be helpful to get to a shared understanding on the scope of the program - it would be quite helpful for us to learn some of the specific data points and research you're seeing, maybe even connect our research teams. We also obviously partner with academics, others. But quite helpful if we have a shared understanding of the problem grounds solutions. In an ideal world - how do we align on solutions, how do we align on shared understanding of most concerning things you are seeing. Eric: That absolutely makes sense. So, on aligning on solutions - o More transparency - in general, we agree here. You're probably familiar with our tool called CrowdTangle. It's currently just showing engagement not just reach. We've been working to share reach with government partners since January. We've made substantial investments in this tool that's open to researchers and academics. We agree that reach better contextualizes things. Open to feedback on how reports could be more useful, other thoughts Kyla: Are you planning to continue having CrowdTangle available going forward? Not my specific product area, but it's been available for many years. It's available to government partners by exception - CDC, WH, and others do have access. Kyla: CrowdTang e - that will continue to be a tool that's available for use? We can conf rm that but I'm not aware of any plans to change that. Kyla: If there's an update on CT, that would be great if you could provide that. That's initial steps and thinking on measuring. Related to this point and the fourth point about amplifying trusted sources. We are very focused on understanding the impact of interventions. We've partnered with organizations - funding RFPs to understand impact of misinformation and RFPs on effectiveness of educational information. One of the more recent things we did - Alliance for Advancing Health Online. Working with Merck, WHO, others, working to foster a better understanding of interventions and how they are improving outcomes. We're providing a substantial amount of funding. We're very invested and w ant more research, more RFP submissions. That could be an area to go deeper in the future. To second point on enforcement strategy, maybe best to have discuss. On this question - the way we enforce on content - what's being posted o n a Page or Group. People post different content on a Page than for instance on an IG account. On RFK, Jr., for example, was using IG account to spread anti -vax account. It reached the threshold of strikes and was removed. He then stopped posting on FB about vaccines at all. CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053610 PRODUCED TO HJC --p .. Filed: 08/07/2023 On the third point -one of the reasons we were reporting on top engaged posts and top reach posts-wanted to see what kind of content was in there. We've been sharing reports with the White House on this. o The top posts on our platform are mostly not about COVID or vaccines. Among the subset of posts that are about COVID and vaccines- the top 100 posts on COVID/vaccines, there are a few more on the potentially inducing hesitancy side. But if you zoom out, those are fewer than the ones coming from credible, authoritative sources. We have more work to do, but that's what we're seeing and what we are sharing. Replicable from CrowdTangle. We're very open to if there are things that we're missing, would love to engage on the specifics. o I'll also say in the SG's Advisory around designing systems in such a way that you can slow down the spread of misinformation. That's a promising approach we are committed to. For example, last year, in WA, we removed the ability to forward a link to many people at once. There were good use cases, like sharinGnk to a birthday party, but took action to limit misinformation spread. o When people share content that could be misinformation, H interstitial that links to the COVID Information Center. :\u00a3 o Just some examples of the changes we've already ma ha are aligned with this approach. The WA one in particular was a bigs~ ch ge. Kyla: The piece we talk about specifically about ad!?&i ~-do you have anywhere publicl~ where you share the impact of those intervention . I know these have all been shared public~y ot sur how deep we got into the data, but we can follow up. -On this question -policy side a~. ent side. We've been working hard over the last year and a half to keep up, have~ o ing with CDC and others to update our policies as things evolve. The enforcement P.ie e is ~s difficult, training classifiers. We also have partnership with third party fact c J-for things that don't meet removal threshold, get sent to third party fact checke Co tent is temporarily demoted pending fact check. We have shared that about 95% of e t1 e when people see those screens/interstitials, they didn't go on to post the content. ~ Kyla: Size of fact chec \u00b7ng t am? We par~ 0 organizations in over 60 languages. An~\\~tlvirality aspect through feed demotions. We remove content that can lead to imm1 t physical harm. For content that doesn't meet that threshold, we instituted borderline dem tions. For example, someone sharing negative side effect posts. Similarly, posts questioning whether you should get a vaccine under a mandate, whether it's government overreach. We demote those. That's not false information, but it leads to a vaccine negative environment. When it comes to looking at COVID misinformation, it's a different approach. What we normally do is just remove or leave to fact checkers. Here, we introduced a middle ground. There's a lot on educational, amplifying credible sources I want to touch upon briefly before we break as well. ~ do you have anywhere this borderline policy? ~it's all public in our Community Standards. There is a link that details all of this, we can send it to you. Last point -helping get people access to credible information. Will be a huge part of solution. This is an area we've invested a lot in, have commitment to. A lot of our efforts are CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT REQUESTED NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION MEMBERS & STAFF ONLY META-118HJC-0053611 Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 114 Date Filed: 08/07/2023around helping organizations meet people where they are with information. And then there is social norming work. A lot of research shows that if you know someone who has gotten vaccinated, it can make you more likely to do get it. We worked with USG on profile frames. At this point, I think 50% of users in the US have seen a friend or family member use a COVID vaccine profile frame. KFF study also shows that friends/family can be very influential. We've also delivered 10 billion ads impressions through partner channels, working to publish data on the impact. There's a lot to build on. o On Amplification, changing how we amplify within core product, making sure that trusted/credible sources are getting more distribution. Eric: Thank you, this is super, super helpful. I know we weren't going to get all the way home. Let me just say two things as we wrap up. 1 - thank you for jumping on the call, we're getting comfortable with being uncomfortable. Want to be honest, appreciate courage having this conversation. I think you'll continue to hear the White House and leaders say they want to move forward with solutions. You'll hear that from Dr. Murthy. Want to be super straight with you. Kyla and I can offline with the team and circle back on solutions. I want to say thank you, can be uncomfortable, really appreciate it. I'm very conscious you need to jump, we'll stand by. Aga n, we're looking to understand what you're seeing, understand next steps and how to partner moving forward. We'll be in touch on email.

A The Foreign Influence Task Force is a component part in Counterintelligence Division that is charged with understanding and mitigating foreign malign influence operations targeting the United States. Q And how long have you been in that role for? A A bit over 2 years. Q A Q A Q A Q A Q A - - Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 123 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242529 A There were --as I mentioned earlier, we aimed to get together with most of the companies within the couple of weeks in the immediate --in the immediate weeks preceding the election. Q Are you familiar with th e October 2020 New York Post story on Hunter Biden's laptop? A I am. Q Do you recall whether any of these social media companies you were meeting with asked you any questions about it? A I do. Q And what is your recollection? Who -- A So I remember having a conversation with or being involved in a conversation with Twitter, and I honestly can't recall if this was repeated to me --I might have been a few minutes late to the meeting --or if --or if I was --I actually overheard it. But it was --it was relayed to me later that somebody from Twitter --I don't recall who. I'm not sure who. Somebody from Twitter essentially asked whether the laptop was real. And one of the FBI folks who was on the call did confirm that, yes, it was befo re another participant jumped in and said no further comment. Q Do you recall who from the FBI said it was real? A I do. Q And who was that? A It's a non -SES employee. I'd have to take that back. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . What's their title? Ms. Dehmlow. An analyst. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . What field office are they out of? Ms. Dehmlow. Again, I 'm not s ure t hat I 'm allowed to pr ovide details here Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 124 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242530 because it was a non- SES employee. Ms. Doocy. We'll take it back. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Can we not know about this, just not the name of the individual? Ms. Doocy. They're in the Criminal Investigative Division. We can tell you that and then get back to you if we can provide a non- SES name. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . I think the committee would like to know the name of the individual but also their title. Ms. Doocy. Sure. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2: Q Was this individual affiliated with FITF? A Again, it was somebody from the Criminal Investigative Division who is embedded with us. Q So yes? A Yes. Q And did this question occur in the context of a bilateral meeting? A It did. Q Do you recall how soon after the story broke that this meeting occurred? A I don't remember. I believe it was the same week, but I don't remember the specific day. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 1: Q On that call with that IA who's in the Criminal Investigative Division, that was the individual who said, \"yes, the laptop is authentic\"? Is that correct? A I don't believe it was that specific. Again, I don't recall hearing the conversation itself. I know it was relayed to me afterwards. But my understanding is that we confirmed that, yes, the laptop was a real laptop. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 125 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242531 Q And then you said another FBI individual came on and said, \"No further comment.\" A Yes. Q Is that correct? A That's correct. Q Who was that individual? A It was some -- it was one of our lawyers who was on the call. Q And who was that individual? A Again -- Ms. Doocy. We'll take that request back. They're not SES. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Do they work out of the General Counsel's Office or a specific field office? Ms. Doocy. They're in the Office of the General Counsel. But, again, we'll take that request back. We don't have authorization to speak to their specific name in this conte xt. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Okay. I think the committee would like to know the individual's na me, as we ll as their title. Thank you. MAJORITY COUNSEL 3 Just to clarify, when you say the laptop was real, you mean it was, like, a real laptop or that it belonged to Hunt er Biden or what exactly? Ms. Dehmlow. Sinc e I wasn't -- I don't recall the spe cifics . I think my understanding is generally we c onfirmed the existence of the laptop. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 : Q Who relayed this i nformation to you? A I don't recall. The reason tha t I remember it s pecifically is tha t we had a Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 126 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242532 conversation afterwards, talking, deliberating on how we would answer the question if another company asked. Q And did this deliberation occur immediately following -- A I would say within, yeah, within the next couple of hours. Q During this time period, October 2020, does FITF have its own in-person office? Or is this conversation over Zoom? A Which --which part of the conversation, the conversation with the companies or the conversation, the deliberations? Q The deliberations. A I believe it happened over our --our --our chat function. Q Do you recall how many FBI personnel were part of this deliberation? A I don't. Q Do you ha ve a ballpark sense? A Just a handful probably. Q Do you recall why you were not in attendance at this part of the bilateral meeting? A Again, it's possible that I was. I just don't recall the part. The part that I remember with clarity is the part immediately after that. It's a very busy time. I might have just been running late, a couple of minutes late, you know. It was a very busy time for the FITF. Q Do you know how Twitter reacted when the first agent said that the laptop was real? A No recollection. Q Did you receive any followup requests for information from Twitter? A Not that I recall, not that came to me. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 127 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242533 Q So you said he was one example. Do you recall other social media companies? A I believe Facebook --we met with Facebook soon thereafter. Can't remember if it was the same day or within a couple o f days. And the y also as ked, and I said, \"No comment.\" That was the -- that was t he decisio n we made in those post- meeting deliberations, which is pretty typical. It was an ongoing i nvestigation, and we don't generally comment on ongoing i nvestigative matters whe n asked. Q Okay. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Who made the decision that the FBI would have no comment to the social media companies going forward? Mr. Hanson. So I want to be clea r. Ms. Dehmlow, obviously, can answer the question as long as it doesn't get into internal deliberations or advice from a lawyer or anything. Ms. Dehmlow. Yeah, and, unfortunately I can't answer that with any further detail on that advice. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . So you can't tell us who made the decision? Ms. Dehmlow. I can say there were internal deliberations with a number of parties, and then -- but I can't get into that further. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . So then, Counsel, are you instructing her not to answer the question any further? Ms. Doocy. We'll take the request for the non- SES back and get back to you as soon as possible. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . And the content of the discussion? Ms. Doocy. So, in this context, she's not authorized to speak to internal deliberations which may implicate attorney -client or other legal privileges today, but we'll Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 128 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242534 take your request back. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . But you're instructing her not to answer today. Is that accurate? Ms. Doocy. To the specifics of the conversation she received related to whether or not she was deliberating about the veracity of the laptop, in this context, yes. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Okay. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 : Q With r espect to the internal deliberations, were there individuals who participated other than members of FITF? A Yes. Again, I can't get into more specifics because of the deliberative process privilege they're articulating. Q Were there members participating in these deliberations other than members of FITF and other than members of OGC? A I can't recall specifics. Q Do you recall who from Facebook asked the question? A I don't. Q Was the laptop on the agenda for either of these bilateral meetings with Twitter or Facebook? A No. It came as a surprise to us that there was questions. At least it came as a surprise to me. I wasn't tracking the news story until that moment. Q And who else was on the call with Facebook? A It would have been essentially the same --same folks, probably the unit chiefs from FITF and some range of other folks. But I don't recall specifics. Q You said that you were the one that said \"no comment\"? A Uh-huh. Q Had it been decided in advance that you'd be the one to answer that Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 129 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242535 question? A No, not that I recall. Q Who was the section chief of FITF at the time? A Bradley Benavides. Q Was he on the call? A Not to my recollection, no. Q Was he on the Twitter call? A Not to my recollection, no. Q Did he usually attend these calls? A He did not. Q Was Elvis Chan on the call with Facebook? A It's likely, but I don't recall specifically. Q Was Elvis Chan on the call with Twitter? A It's likely, but I don't recall specifically. Mr. Jordan. You acknowledged, back to the meeting with Twitter, when the first FBI official acknowledged that the FBI --that the --excuse me --that the laptop was real, how long had you -- how long you had known that information? Ms. Dehmlow. I don't remember. I really can't recall. Mr. Jordan. Did you learn that it week you? Learn it months before? When did you know that the laptop was real? Ms. Dehmlow. I really don't remember. Mr. Jordan. You said --that's the word you used. You said the agent said the laptop was real. Is that right? Ms. Dehmlow. He confirmed at some point that the laptop existed, yes. But, again, I don't recall the specific language, and I wasn't there. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 130 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 3 4 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242536 Ms. Doocy. Can I confer with the client for a moment? MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Yeah, we'll go off the record. [Discussion off the record.] MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . We'll go back on the record. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2: Q When the Facebook employee asked the question, do you recall exactly what they asked? A I don't. Q Do you know if it was about the laptop? A Yes. It was essentially whether or not we --yes, it was something about the laptop. I don't remember --I know that my answer was \"no comment\" because --and the question doesn't stick in my mind because it was something about the laptop. And I said, \"No comment.\" Again, that was not my decision. It wasn't my final call. There were other agency, other departments, other FBI equities at stake, investigative equities, and so pretty typical for us to come to that conclusion. Q Were you aware if Twitter or Facebook were taking steps to censor the story? A I was not. Q Did you ever become aware? A Eventually, when the --when there was extensive news coverage about it ultimately, but I don't know if I knew it that week, within a couple of months. Q Do you think it was the right decision to say \"no comment\"? A Not here to --again, it wasn't my call and it's pretty typical for us to not comment on ongoing investigative equities. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 131 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 242537 Q When the information was relayed to you following the Twitter call that the first agent had said the laptop was real, just to clarify, you knew prior to that conversation that the laptop was real. Is that correct? A I did, yes. Q But you don't recall when approximately you learne d. A I don't, sorry. Q Sitting here today, do you know when the FBI first determined that the laptop was real? A I don't. I know that there is some information in the public record regarding when the FBI acquired the laptop, but I don't, sitting here, remember that date. Q Do you know who else at FITF knew that the laptop was real? A I don't actually. I would assume both my --yes, I would certainly say that Brad Benavides was aware. Q What about the individuals on the Russia unit? A I would assume the unit chief was also aware. I'm pretty certain of that fact. Q For the individual -- Mr. Hanson. Just to clarify, do you know to a certainty that they were aware, or are you just making deductions? Ms. Dehmlow. I'm pretty certain that they were aware. Mr. Hanson. Okay. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2: Q In adv ance o f the bilateral meeting, would the FITF team discuss internally about wha t to cover in a meeting? A We would, yes. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 132 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 2425173 Q --that very frequently it wasn't a FITF -owned investigation or equity. Is that right? A I don't think that's what I testified, no. Q Okay. A I said FITF is focused on those actors and those activities, and those activities are inclusive of the information that we're passing to --to --to the socia l media companies. So that was very much a FITF equity. We're program managing those cases. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 1: Q When you say that the Hunter Biden wasn't a FITF -owned equity -- A Uh-huh. Q --did it have any equities in the FBI investigation of Hunter Biden? A Did what have any equities? Q FITF. A Again, I can't speak to that ongoing investigative action. That's an ongoing investigation. I can't speak to any details regarding it. Q I s that an instruction from counsel? A I think, yes, but they can confirm it. Mr. H anson. I'd ask you to not respond to any informatio n regarding o ngoing investigations. Ms. Dehmlow. I can't speak to ongoing investigations, ongoing investigative activ ity. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2: Q If the ongoing investigation had FITF equities i n it, then FITF would be able to share info rmation? Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 133 Date Filed: 08/07/20231 2 34 5 67 8 9 10 11 1213 14 1516 17 1819 20 2122 23 2425174 A Not broadly. The FITF can only share information in the context of the Justice Manual provision regarding details of foreign malign influence operations. So it's not that we can just broadly share anything regarding an ongoing investigative equity. There's specific provisions of the Justice Manual that govern what we can and cannot share. Q Okay. But, if the Hunter Biden laptop were part of a foreign malign influence operation, that is something that FITF would be able to share information on. A Yeah, I don't want to speak to a hypothetical. But if there is a foreign malign influence oper ation and we've got specific details about how those actors are propagating information operations, influence operations on platforms, that's something that we could share the specific details of. Q Okay. I mean, that sounds like a \"yes\" to my previous question but -- A I want to be really specific about what we do and don't do because we don't just comment broadly on investigative activity. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . So did FITF share any information with social media companies regarding the Hunter Biden investigati on as it relates to foreign malign activity? Ms. Doocy. Same instruction. Ms. Dehmlow. Yeah. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . What's the instruction, Mary? Ms. Doocy. Not to comment on ongoing investigations. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Thanks. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2: Q So, in thes e bilateral FITF meetings, social media c ompanies, is it fair to s ay it was routine that they would be re ceiving information related to foreign malign influence operations t hat related to inve stigations o f the 135 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 1 COMMITTEE ON THE JUDICIARY, U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, WASHINGTON, D.C.

I'd like to now go over the ground rules and guidelines that we'll follow during today's interview. Our questioning will proceed in rounds. The majority will ask questions first for 1 hour, and then the minority will have an opportunity to ask questions for an equal period of time if they choose. We will alternate back and forth until there are no more questions and the interview is over. Typically, we take a short break at the end of each hour, but if you would like to take a break ap art from that, please just let us know. As you can see, there are official court reporters taking down everything we say to make a written record, so we ask that you give verbal responses to all questions. Do you understand? Mr. Agranovich. Yes. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . So the court reporters can take down a clear record, we will do our best to limit the number of people directing questions at you during any given hour to just those people on the staff whose turn it is. Please try and speak clearly so the court reporter can understand and so the folks down at the end of the table can hear you. It's important that we don't talk over one another or interrupt each other if we can help it, and that goes for everybody present at today's interview. We enco urage witnesses who appear before the committee to freely consult with counsel if they so choose. It is my understanding that you are appearing today with counsel. Is that correct? Mr. Agranovich. That is correct. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 141 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 7 MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 . Could counsel pl ease state your name for the record. Mr. Brown.

Great. EXAMINATION BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 : Q Thank you, Mr. Agranovich. Could you state your full name, please. A Yes. My full name is David Jacob Agranovich. Q And where's your current place of employment? A I currently work at Meta. Q Okay. What's your current title? A I'm Meta's director for global threat disruption. Q MINORITY COUNSEL 1 . I'm sorry. We can't hear you. MINORITY COUNSEL 2 . We can't hear you. MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 : Q A Q Okay. Great. Your counsel started to provide some of this. At a high level, could you provide your employment history? A Y es. So I currently work at Meta as Meta's Direc tor for G lo bal Threat Disruption. And I joined the company as Meta's G lobal Threat Disruption Lead. Case: 144 that down to coor dinated inauthentic behavior. A Uh-huh. Q Were there other policies that you consulted with the government on? A Not that I can recall. Yeah, not that I can recall. Q You said that hack -and-leak concerns, hack -and-leak operations, that would fall un der your team's purview. A The hack -and-leak policy specifically would fall under our team's purview. Q Is that a policy you worked on directly? A Yes. Q How has it changed since you first joined Meta? A The hack -and-leak, as you can imagine, hack -and-leak has been an issue that security teams, not just ours but across industry and government, have been focused on for several years now. There were hack -and-leak operations that were identified going back to 2016, linked to Russian military intelligen ce services. There were hack -and-leak operations targeting the Macron election in France after that. And then there have been a number of hack -and-leak operations linked to a number of different foreign intelligence actors in countries all over the world since then. So, naturally, hack -and-leak was one of the various threat factors that we were focused on and wanted to make sure that we were both keeping abreast of and being cautious to make sure we weren't allowing the platform to be manipulated in any way. And so the hack -and-leak policy which we had developed functionally focused on three main areas. So, first, determining whether the material that we were evaluating was obtained b y a hacked, from a hacked source; i.e., was it obtained by someone w ithout Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 145 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 43 authorization to access that material? Second was the material being disseminated with an intent to deceive? And that functionally on our platform, what that would mean is, is there indicia of deception, is there fake account usage or fake accounts being used to disseminate the material? And then, third, was the material being disseminated on behalf o f or at the direction of a foreign government influence operation? And so that's the three -part test of the hack- and-leak policy, and that's functionally what the policy was in my time at Meta. Q And was that -- so that was the case when you first started back in 2018 to today? When did this three -part test come into being? A To the best of my recollection, the policy was developed in early to mid-2020. Q And what was -- MINORITY COUNSEL 2 . I'm sorry? When? Mr. Agranovich. In early to mid -2020? BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2: Q And what was the policy before then? A I understand there are other policies at the company that can apply to hacked materials. They're not policies that I work on, but I know that those existed prior to the hack -and-leak policy being developed. Q And did you ever consult with the government regarding your -- or regarding Meta's hack -and-leak policy? A I recollect that we discussed the fact of us working on hack -and-leak issues in meetings with the government, but I don't believe we consulted with the government on the policy itself. Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 146 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 44 Q Okay. Did the government ever contact you to comment on your hack -and-leak policy? A Not to my recollection. MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 . Do you know where we are on time? MAJORITY COUNSEL 3. You have about a minute. Mr. Brown. You have about a minute and 37 seconds left. BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 1 : Q When did those meetings occur? A Which meetings? Q The meetings you just referenced where there was a discussion of Meta's hack -and-leak policy with the government? A I believe the summer of 2020. Q And which entities were those discussions happening with? A That would be the Foreign Influence Task Force, DHS, CISA, and ODNI. MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 . Were these one- on-one meetings or were other companies invited as well? Mr. Agranovich. These meetings, these were multiple companies, and then the government agencies I mentioned. MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 . Do you remember who instigated these meetings? Was it on the government end, or was it from industry's end? Mr. Agranovich. I don't know who instigated the meetings. Mr. Brown. We're at time. I was wondering if we could take a break off the record. Thanks. [Recess.] MINORITY COUNSEL 2 . We're ready to go back on the record.

But within 's org, there 14 were a number of people thinking about issues around the 2020 electio ns at that time. 15 Q So is it concern about the 2020 elections that led Facebook to adopt a 16 hack -and-leak policy? 17 A In part, yes. 18 Q What specifically about the 2020 election? 19 A As we were preparing for the 2020 elections, we identified that one of the 20 likely risks it was important to prepare for was a hack -and-leak campaign from a foreign 21 threat actor like Russia. 22 Q And by \"we,\" do you mean Facebook? 23 [Discussion off the record.] 24 Mr. Gleicher.

Chairman 4 Jordan has requested this interview as part of the committee 's investigation of how and 5 the extent to which the executive branch has coerced and colluded with companies and 6 other intermediaries to censor speech. 7 Would the witness please state your name for the record? 8 Mr. Stamos.

Our questioning will proceed in rounds. The majority will ask 11 questions first for 1 hour, and then the minority will have an opportunity to ask questions 12 for an equal period of time if they so choose. 13 We will alternate back and forth until there are no more questions and the 14 interview is over. Typically we take a break at the end of each hour, but if you would 15 like to take a break apart from that, please just let us know. 16 As you can see, there's an official court reporter taking down everything we say to 17 make a written record, so we ask that you give verbal responses to all questions. 18 Do you understand that? 19 20 Mr. Stamos. I do. MAJORITY COUNSEL 1. So the court reporter can take down a clear record, we 21 will do our best to limit the number of people directing questions at you during any given 22 hour to just those people on the staff whose turn it is. 23 Please try and speak clearly so the court reporter can understand and so the folks 24 down at the end of the cable can hear you as well. It is important that we don't talk 25 over one another or interrupt each other if we can help that, and that goes for everybody Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 178 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 6 present at today's interview. 1 We want you to answer our questions in the most complete and truthful manner 2 as possible, so we'll take our time. If you have any questions or if you do not understand 3 one of our questions, please just let us know. Our questions will cover a wide range of 4 topics so if you need clarification at any point just ask. 5 If you honestly don't know the answer to a question or do not remember, it is best 6 not to guess. Please give us your best recollection, an d it is okay to tell us if you learned 7 information from someone else. Just indicate how you came to know the information. 8 If there are things you don't know or can't remember, just say so and please inform us 9 who, to the best of your knowledge, might be able to article. 10 You should also understand that by law you are required to answer questions 11 from Congress truthfully. 12 Do you understand that? 13 Mr. Stamos.

You may proceed. 14 Mr. Stamos. I do. Thank you. 15 Good morning. I'm glad to have this opportunity to describe the work of the 16 Stanford Int ernet Observatory and to address misperceptions about its participation in 17 the Election Integrity Partnership and the Virality Project. 18 The Stanford Internet Observatory studies misuses of the internet with the goals 19 of publishing research, suggesting technical and policy mitigations, and educating the 20 next generation of cyber specialists. I'm the founder and the director of the observatory 21 and a lecturer in the computer science department at Stanford. 22 To that end, I teach courses in cybersecurity and online safety at Stanford, along 23 with supervising our research efforts. Our research includes work on child safety, online 24 promotion of self- harm, generative AI, and influence campaigns by China, Iran, Russia, 25 Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 180 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 98 Q You mentioned that the Global Engagement Center was one of the entities 1 that can submit reports, tickets as well? 2 A Yes. They could send -- they could send emails in to us for us to open and 3 to look into, yes. 4 Q Do you recall who at the GEC you interacted with? 5 A I don't- -- I mean, personally I had -- there was a meeting in which I believe 6 the director of the GEC was at here in D.C. I don't recall her name. I -- I didn't have 7 most of those conversations. 8 Q The meeting in D.C. that you just referenced, what was the purpose of that 9 meeting? 10 A I believe it was to tell them about what EIP was doing and telling them that 11 they could send into us reports of foreign influence that they saw, potential foreign 12 influence. 13 Q Do you know who first connected GEC and EIP together? 14 A I believe that we had already had preexisting relationships with GEC because 15 they had published in this area before the EIP. 16 Q In addition to CISA and GEC, do you recall any other Federal agencies that 17 played either informal, like, external stakeholder role or otherwise consulted EIP? 18 A So the only groups that could and did report from the Federal Government 19 report anything to us was the GEC, which is actually part of the government and then the 20 EI-ISAC external, you know. And you'd have to give it your own determination of how 21 much of the government that is. But those are the only two groups that did send 22 anything in to us. We did do briefings for several other agencies and we had one ticket 23 that we then sent out to the FBI. 24 Q Which other Federal agencies did EIP briefly? 25 Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 181 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 99 A I did a briefing for General Nakasone then the director of NSA and Cyber 1 Command. 2 Q And did these briefings -- when did they occur in the process? Is it 3 pre-election? 4 A Pre-election, yes. Like in the late summer, early fall we did a briefing. He 5 had come to campus and had heard us talk about our foreign work. And he asked me to 6 brief his executive staff on our concerns and what kind of foreign influence who happen 7 during the election. 8 Q And the FBI mentioned -- received the ticket. Did the FBI also receive 9 briefings for the election? 10 A The FBI was part of that briefing, so I did it from the FBI offic e in -- in San 11 Francisco because I just can't Zoom in to the NSA. 12 Q Do you recall who set up the meeting between you and the NSA? 13 A Elvis Chan had set up the -- so the meeting was set up because Nakasone 14 had come to campus. Elvis was the facilitator who provided the space and participated, 15 listened to the briefing in San Francisco. 16 Q Yeah. Did you know Mr. Chan before this meeting had occurred? 17 A I did. 18 Q And how did you know special agent Chan? 19 A Yeah, he runs the group in the San Francisco office of the FBI that handles 20 high profile national security cyber attacks and so had I worked with him both at Yahoo. 21 At Yahoo we had been attacked by the -- by contractors working for the Russian FSB. 22 And then at Facebook we had a number of attempted attack s, as well as 23 manipulations of the platform to cause attacks by a variety of government agencies, 24 foreign government agencies. And so Elvis was the primary contact for all of that 25 Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 182 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 100 because he ran the group that would investigate those kinds of foreign acti ons. 1 Q Do you recall anyone else from the FBI attending this meeting? 2 A There were some other people from his squad. I don't recall their names. 3 Q And so in addition to the NSA, FBI, do you recall any other entities that were 4 present at the meeting? 5 A The -- it was a video conference. In the room were only FBI agents. The 6 only people I knew of who were on the other link were NSA. 7 Q So you mentioned FBI, NSA, GEC and CISA. Were there any other 8 government agencies that received a briefing from EIP? 9 A Not to my knowledge. 10 Q Did you -- in addition to this briefing that the FBI helped facilitate between 11 EIP and NSA, did you have any other interactio ns with the FBI as a function of EIP's work? 12 A We did the preemptive briefing and we sent them one report related to 13 Arabian action in the election and I believe that was our only interaction with them. 14 Q When EIP was organized, were there new EIP email addresses created for 15 folks? 16 A No. We have a domain that has one working email address info@, which 17 was a mailing list that went to three or four different people. 18 Q Okay. Do you know who those three or four people are? 19 A It was me, probably Elena Cryst or deputy director of SIO, Kate Starbird and I 20 believe there's a comms person at UW, I forgot his name, who'd receive those emails. 21 Because often that would be media requests and he would be the one who handled 22 those. 23 Q So I think we started to touch upon this, but how would membe rs of EIP 24 communicate with one another? 23-30445 217 1 [4:42 p.m.] 2 BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2: 3 Q Who was the EIP's primary point of contact at Reddit? 4 A I've forgotten her name. There was a woman in the policy team. We can 5 come back to you. 6 Q Do you recall with respect to Alphabet if there was different points of 7 contact for Google as opposed to YouTube or if it was the same point of contact? 8 A I beli eve it was the same. For these purposes, the central Google team was 9 the one who was coordinating on their election policies. 10 Q In 2020, who was EIP's primary former contact with Discord? 11 A I don't recall with Discord. 12 Q What about with respect to Wi kimedia? 13 A Yes. There's a -- I don't remember what the name is of the person at 14 Wikimedia. I wasn't a part of those meetings. 15 Q Who would have been part of those meetings? 16 A Probably or some of the students who were doing onboarding. 17 Q Who is EIP's primary point of contact with Pinterest? 18 A I don't recall. 19 Q Are there plans to -- you mentioned that EIP -- obviously, this is the 2020 20 iteration. In 2022, you said there were some differences. Are there any plans to have 21 some continuation of the partnership for the 2024 election? 22 A That's an interesting question. I'm going to have to have a discussion with 23 Stanford's leadership. Since this investigation has cost the university now approaching 24 seven figures legal fees, it's been pretty succes sful I think in discouraging us from making 25 - Case: 23-30445 Document: 161 Page: 184 Date Filed: 08/07/2023 218 it worthwhile for us to do a study in 2024. 1 MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 . Do you recall which exhibit we're on? 2 . 21 -- 22. 3 MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 . 22. All right. 4 [Stamos Exhibit No. 22 5 Was marked for identification.] 6 BY MAJORITY COUNSEL 2 : 7 Q Do you know who is? I don't know if I'm pronouncing her 8 name right. 9 A Yeah. She was the woman I was thinking of, the head of policy for Reddit. 10 Q Great. And at her email at the top of the page, she says that 11 \"We\" -- assuming referring to Reddit -- \"are unable to participate in Jiras, but we are 12 happy to receive info over email.\" 13 Do you recall that Reddit didn't respond in Jira directly? 14 A Right. They did not -- for whatever reason, did not want to have something 15 they had to log into. They wanted things to be put in the email and sent directly to 16 them. 17 Q Okay. And then there's an email below from you. You explain the 18 situation. There are a couple of links. And then below you say: \"It would be great if 19 we could get somebody from Reddit on the Jira, just like Facebook, Google, Twitter, 20 TikTok, Instagram, CISA, EI -ISAC.\" 21 Were you referring to CISA, the government agency? 22 A I was probably making a mistake there talking about CISA because EI -ISAC 23 were the people who had access to the Jira. 24 Q But you list both EI -ISAC and Is that "}
