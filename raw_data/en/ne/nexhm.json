When you develop [a hormonal imbalance](https://www.cutlerintegrativemedicine.com/health-concerns/hormonal-imbalance/), you can feel the effects in many different ways. Fortunately, naturopathic medicine can restore the balance of your hormones using natural methods that work with your body, not against it. A hormonal imbalance occurs when one or more hormones levels become higher or lower than usual. Because hormonal signals are interconnected, an imbalance in one will often affect others. Hormones manage everything from blood pressure to respond to stress, so a hormone imbalance can manifest with a wide range of symptoms.

Some people who seek naturopathic treatment have a hormonal imbalance and have never realized it.

Adrenal hormones manage vital body functions like blood pressure and responding to stress. Insulin regulates the body's use of glucose, a critical fuel for the cells, especially in the brain. Your evaluation begins with testing to determine whether you have an imbalance in one or more hormones. Dr. Cutler will review all the factors affecting your hormone levels and develop a plan to address them.
