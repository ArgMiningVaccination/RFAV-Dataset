The Chinese believe that each of the meridian system and its associated organ is responsible for processing and storing one of the five emotions. Emotions aren't inherently bad. It's their build-up that becomes a problem. Life moves so fast no matter how in tune we are we cannot react to everything that is occurring. Our body is designed to help us and holds on to the thoughts and feelings so when we have time we can sort through them, keep what we would like and let go of the rest. This meditation helps you do just that. As you listen, you may have feelings surface. Allow it. It's not important to identify whether the feeling is grief,worry, fear, Joy,or anger only to let it move through and out of your field of energy. This practice will allow you to sit side-by-side with your emotions and receive their guidance instead of feeling inhabited and overwhelmed by them. Start by closing your eyes. Feel your body supported by the surface beneath you. It is OK if thoughts or sounds come into your mind, that's normal.You will still benefit from this meditation. I will bring your awareness to parts of your body starting at your head. With your inhale into the body part you will visualize filling it with either light or a color of your choice. As you exhale you will imagine the breath as a grey smoke.The grey smoke is removing from that body part any toxins, old stuck energy, or pain with it. The new breath is energizing with fresh revitalizing soothing energy. Bring your awareness to your head, the bones of your skull, relax your jaw and your throat. Bring your awareness to your chest, relax your shoulders your upper back. Bring your awareness to your abdomen your lower back and your pelvis. Bring your awareness to your hips and your bottom. Bring your awareness to the front of your thighs your quadriceps and the back of your thighs your hamstrings. Bring your awareness to your knees relax your knee caps. Bring your awareness to your calves and relax your ankles. Bring your awareness and relax your feet and your toes. Now coming back up to your neck and shoulders pay special attention to this area to release tension. Imagine a slow-moving liquid like honey coating and penetrating it with your healing light or color . The slow-moving liquid is moving over your neck, then the top of your shoulders and slowly over your elbows and then your forearms. Finally moving over your wrist, your hand, your fingers bringing with it any lingering tension or stress which simply drips off of your fingertips, off of your body for good and out of your energy field. Keep your eyes closed and for three breath .visualize your entire body filled with light or your color. Notice how light you feel, how relaxed yet energized. Take this feeling into your day. In Traditional Chinese Medicine, Spleen and Stomach are the organ and energy systems connected with the Earth Element; through them we cultivate stability and balance. When we eat, we are reminded of the faith it takes to rise each day and reliably give ourselves vital fuel. Eating is an expression of our commitment to give our own presence to the world. The Stomach and Spleen meridians are responsible for digesting food ,drink, and life experiences and transforming them into strength. In order for us to metabolize life and then receive nurturance from ourselves and others, the Yi energy of the Spleen must be strong. The Earth Element lies in the transitions between all of the other elements. Like the mud-packed walls of an Adobe home, Earth literally holds us together. To thrive we need a strong affiliation to the earth to maintain a strong faith in the self, faith in our surroundings, and faith in others. Now place your hands gently on your abdomen bring to mind the middle burner the digestive center of your body. Take long slow deep breaths feeling your abdomen rise under your hands as you inhale and fall with your exhale.Think of all that your body does for you without ever being asked. It is a devoted friend that deserves appreciation. We will trace the Spleen meridian and from it visualize bringing strong Chi to the middle burner filling it with vital energy. Starting out at the inside of the big toes imagine you are drawing a line of yellow golden light slowly upwards as you breath. Feel the insides of your calves light up with golden yellow, as you exhale feel your abdomen drop under your hands. Inhaling pull the light to the insides of your knees, next the insides of your thighs . Continuing to pull the golden energy up and over your abdomen until it settles directly under your hands. Now feel the whole channel from the insides of your big toes to your abdomen full of light, full of energy, full of stability. Rest here as long as you would like. This was a meditation that was shared with me by a dear friend. It was given to her by her teacher Hugh Milne. It is called 'the four chambered heart meditation'. In Chinese medicine, the heart is called the Shen which translates as heart-mind. In the west we think that only a full heart can create happiness. In the East, the belief is that a healthy 'Shen' will be at times full and at times empty. The ongoing flux between the two yin and yang states gives us a clear understanding of both our vulnerability and our strength. Close your eyes and consider the space that you're in. See the four corners of the room and above them place a pyramid of light over them to visualize the light coming down into the four corners and spreading throughout the room. Now allow that light to come down through the top of your head into your whole body and breathe. Breathe in and circulate this light from your tailbone to the crown of your head. Exhale from the top of the head down to the tailbone keep repeating this at your own pace. Now allow this light to move deeper into your body and into your heart space in the center of your chest. To this place bring an image of a red heart, expand it and allow energy to circulate there. Acknowledge how you already feel more aware of the real you. Breathe into the depth of who you are. Now take a deep breath into the upper left part of the four chambered heart the upper left chamber called the left atrium. This full heart resides here. Consider how full your life is. How wholeheartedly do you live your life? Is it bubbling over with energy? A full heart is joyful, laughing,smiling. A fully nourished heart has the ability to give your gifts away Generously and to pass on love Generously. Ask 'how are you today full heart?' and wait for an answer. Am I full, am I empty, am I halfway? What do I need to do to fill up my full heart? What part of my full heart am I ready to look at today? Is there a spot where there are cobwebs in my heart and am I ready to look at that and deal with it? Can I be honest with whether I can deal with this cobweb place without it over-powering me? 'How can I best serve myself and you, full heart?' and wait for the answer. What truth lies within my full heart? What challenge am I ready for that will enrich me? And wait for the answer. Full heart, what vision, image, or sensation, will most inspire me to become completely full hearted. Now take three full breaths into the full heart. Move to the lower left chamber of your heart and with three breaths sense how your open heart is sitting in this sacred circle under this pyramid of light. Can I feel my own energy field, am I open to receiving and sensing the pain of another? Am I open to the form that healing takes or do I need to fill my desire to fix things or control things in order to deal with the pain of others? Take a deep breath. How open am I to myself, to learning and expanding? The heart is a people sensitive organ. Who in my life am I most comfortable with? See those people see how your open heart responds to that image of another person? 'What does that do to my heart?' And then ask who is the most challenging person in my life, the one that shows me my Darkside? And notice what that does to the open heart. Can you accept the image of them mirrored into your heart? This person is the one who most reminds us of what we don't want to see or hear or feel about ourselves. Look into that mirror so we can acceptance, it and send it to the light. Take a deep breath into your open heart . Now breath into the upper right chamber of your heart. This is your clear heart. This is the heart we all had before we left childhood. This is the instinctual heart who warms to the person that we want near and shies away from the one we want to step away from. Breathe in to your clear heart and as you hold a sense of clarity ask yourself where am I in my life, am I muddling from one mistake to another? Can I be on the higher ground of my soul and see the direction and set things right? Can I allow my soul and the internal wisdom of my ancestors guide my path with clarity? What's stopping me from being clear? Who would I be if I were clear all the time? Who says I can't be? The opposite of a clear heart is confusion, loss of direction, desperately searching for material outside of myself so I can be happy. Take a deep breath and to your clear heart and honor your own clarity and create separation from the confusion so that the path can be different now Now take a deep breath into your lower right chamber of your heart, this is the strong heart. Deep strong power breaths into your lower right chamber and see it, feel it as your breath comes in and out your heart. Here's the song of your heart: a strong heart has the courage to fight for what he or she believes in. Strong heart is not afraid of the consequences of doing what is right for the heart. We have strong people living here among us now. Breathe into your strong heart, what do you have to do? What are you here for? How might you be avoiding the strength of your own heart? How might we not be following our vision? Now take three breaths into the whole heart and feel all of it come together. Focus on the love that you have shown for yourself today by taking the time to care for your own heart. And feeling this completion begin to close your four chambered heart meditation.
