Even though the prospects of vaccination seem promising, too many regions of the world are still experiencing the woes of this infectious disease. Although I now realize my over-optimistic attitude, I feel the time has come for us to imagine how the post-pandemic world could be reconstructed. Surely, comparative literary poetics will offer some of the intellectual stimulus required by this herculean task. This issue of Literary Research therefore explores the multifaceted, indeed rhizomatic, research methodologies through which our discipline could help reconfigure our world, thus inviting us to look at it through different lenses. The scholarship section of the journal comprises five essays highlighting the complexity of the itineraries enabled through our field of research. In his timely opening essay, \"Irrecoverable Histories,\" Robert J.C Young examines how the diasporic issues of our century are reflected in literature. He claims that, in the last decades, \"migration novels and autobiographies, memoirs, oral histories [...] have typically been less concerned with the physical event of migration as such than its aftermath, of encountering a different, unfamiliar culture, of being regarded as an alien to it, and as a consequence negotiating the turmoil of dislocated or split identities\" (33). In \"Dramaturgies of Erasure and Returns: On Exile, Nostalgia, and Homecoming,\" Yana Meerzon focuses on similarly urgent topics, analyzing \"how Milan Kundera's novel Ignorance (1999), Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything Is Illuminated (2002), and Olivier Kemeid's play Furieux et d\u00e9sesp\u00e9r\u00e9s (2013) stage parallax as paradigms of exilic displacements, nostalgia and returns\" (63). The subsequent essay by Hubert Roland sheds new light on the German phase in the development of magical realism. Through a close reading analysis of works by Hermann Kasack and Anna Seghers, Roland argues that the magical realist mode of writing has too exclusively been associated 17 | 18 [with postmodernism and postcolonialism. In her contribution, Danielle Perrot-Corpet foregrounds the link between comparatism and queer thought, an intersection she regards as the source of what she terms an \"esth\u00e9tique du trouble,\" a phrase in which the last word is endowed with positive connotations of ambivalence. In the concluding essay to this section, \"Diachronic Narratology and Historical Inquiry: Strategies, Principles, and Metaphors,\" Kai Mikkonen submits that \"it is highly justified to ask how historicizing narratology could benefit from a comparative study of narratives across language areas and literary traditions, given the fact that narrative devices - indeed kinds of narrative - travel across borders and develop through intercultural relations\" (157). He thus invites scholars to engage in further research on the theory of narratology.] Echoes of the rhizomatic potentialities of comparative literature resurge in the two pieces collected in the \"review essays\" section. Taking her cue from Susan Bassnett's notion of the \"outward turn\" of translation studies, i.e. their growing interdisciplinarity, Marlene Esplin surveys recent methodological tendencies in the field. As she contends, \"this outward turn in translation studies or 'post-translation' studies is somewhat less comparative and less text- or language-centric - it, rather, emphasizes how problems of translation are already at interstices of other disciplines and brings methods of translation studies to bear on the major questions and polemics of our moment\" (169). In my own review essay, which echoes Hubert Roland's scholarly essay, I examine two recently published critical anthologies on magical realism: Christopher Warnes and Kim Anderson Sasser's Magical Realism and Literature as well as Richard Perez and Victoria Chevalier's The Palgrave Handbook of Magical Realism in the Twenty-First Century. In contrast to Hubert Roland's focus on early magical realism, the two volumes analyzed here emphasize the contemporary global ramifications of this mode of writing. The 2021 issue of Literary Research contains a new feature: a forum on literary historiography, guest-edited by Karen-Margrethe Simonsen, in which members of the ICLA Comparative History of Literatures in European Languages research group (CHLEL) discuss their ongoing research. This forum, comprising contributions by Mussgnug, Fusillo, Helgesson, Neumann, Van Hulle, Beloboradova, Das, and Simonsen, carefully documents the innovative work carried out by CHLEL. As always, the book reviews section of the journal is quite substantial. It is framed by Jenny Webb's review of Outka's Viral Modernism. The Influenza Pandemic and Interwar Literature and Marie Laureillard's 18 | 19 [review of Gaffric's La l'\u00e9crivain ta\u00efwannais Wu Ming-yi. While Jenny Webb reviews a timely book for our COVID-19 pandemic times, Marie Laureillard examines a monograph dealing with the ecocritical concerns central to our age. Thus linking Modernism and the Anthropocene, these pieces aptly introduce and conclude the entire section. This part of the issue further contains numerous book reviews on such wide-ranging topics as European literatures, hispanophone, Latin-American, and Brazilian literary works, African and Indian literary studies, translation, literary theory, performance and cosmopolitanism, literary transnationalisms, postcolonialism, and feminism. The issue's epilogue comprises the obituaries of two eminent scholars in the field, Steven Sondrup and Wladimir Krysinski.] This editorial would not be complete without expressing my gratitude to all those who made this 2021 issue a reality: my dedicated editorial assistants Jessica and Samuel, Mr. Thierry Waser, Peter Lang's commissioning editor in Brussels, as well as the publisher's production team. I also thank the anonymous members of our advisory board who peer-reviewed the scholarly essays collected here; guest editor Karen-Margrethe Simonsen for her brilliant proposal of including a forum in the journal; and, Dorothy Figueira, the immediate past editor, who kindly suggested the name of potential book reviewers. The publication of this Open-access journal would not be possible without the constant financial support of ICLA, whose board I wish to thank for kindly extending my editorship until 2025. I shall certainly look forward to further consolidating the scholarly strength of the journal in the years to come. Marc Maufort Brussels, June 2021 [Les multiples itin\u00e9raires la revue.
