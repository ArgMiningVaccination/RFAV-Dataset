Immunotherapy is indicated i n patients whose triggering allergens have been determined by appropriate skin or in vitro testing. The goal is to reduce the allergy patient's sensitivity when exposed to the offending allergen in the future. Treatment begins with low doses to prevent sev ere reactions. Gradually the doses are increased and are given once or twice a week until the body becomes tolerant of the allergen. After the maintenance dose is achieved, the interval between injections may range between two and six weeks. Immunotherapy may be administered continuously for several years. Related Policies Allergy Skin and Challenge Testing Maximum Units of Service ***Note: This Medical Policy is complex and technical. For questions concerning the technical language and/or specific clinical indications for its use, please consult your physician. Policy BCBSNC will provide coverage for Allergy Immunotherapy when it is determined to be medically necessary because the medical criteria and guidelines shown below are met. Benefits Applicatio n This medical policy relates only to the servic es or supplies described herein . Please refer to the Member's Benefit Booklet for availability of benefits. Member's benefits may vary according to benefit design; therefore member benefi t language should be reviewed before applying the terms of this medical policy. When Allergy Immunotherapy is covered A. Allergy Immunotherapy by subcutaneous injection is covered for patients with demonstrated hypersensitivity and/or severe and debilitating symptoms that cannot be adequately managed by medications or avoidance of the allergen. Injections of airborne or insect venom allergens should be prepared for the patient individually. B. Rapid desensitization, also called Rush Immunotherapy, or acute immunotherap y, is covered for the following indications when administered per the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology practice parameters and by a board certified allergist or provider with additional training or certification in rush immunotherapy: Page 2 of 11 An Independent Licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Allergy Immunotherapy (Desen sitization) Allergy to a particular drug that cannot be t reated effectively with alternative medications. [Although not considered allergy immunotherapy, drug desensitization is considered medically necessary when there is no alternative medication or therapy available to treat a life-threatening condition. Dese nsitization is an immunologic method that allows allergic patients to receive the sensitizing drug safely. Drug desensitization involves the rapid administration of incremental doses of a specific drug for patients with IgE antibodies to the drug that cannot be treated effectively with alternative medications. Drug desensitization is covered only when no alternative drug is available for therapy and the risk of continued administration of the offending drug may be less than the risk to life posed by the und erlying disease. ]; OR Insect sting (e.g., wasps, hornets, bees, fire ants) hypersensitivity (hymenoptera); OR Moderate to severe allergic rhinitis requiring treatment during or immediately before the season of the affecting allergy. When Allergy Immunotherapy is not covered A. Allergy Immunotherapy is not covered for the following indications because it is considered investigational: 1) Chronic urticaria; 2) Angioedema; vasomotor rhinitis; 6) Intrinsic (non- allergic) asthma. B. The following allergy treatments are not covered because they are considered investigational including, but not limited to : 1) Provocative and neutralization therapy for food allergies, by sublingual, intradermal, and subcutaneous routes. Provocative and neutralization therapy involves administering neutralizing doses rather than standard doses of allergens either under the tongue or into the skin; 2) Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) except for the Grastek\u00ae, Ragwitek\u00ae , and Odactra. more information. http://www.bcbsnc.com/content/services/formulary/drug- search.htm 3) Urine autoinjections (autogenous urine immunization) - (a substance from the urine is injected into the skin); 4) Repository emulsion therapy; 5) Low dose immunotherapy as the technique; 6) Enzyme -Potentiated Desensitization; 7) Acupuncture for allergies; Page 3 of 11 An Independent Licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Allergy Immunotherapy (Desen sitization) 8) Homeopathy for including Allerdent \u00ae compounded toothpaste. Subcutaneous immunotherapy performed in the home setting is considered investigational . Policy Guidelines Allergen proof supplies, such as mattresses, mattress casings, pillows, pillow casings, and other supplies that are commonly used in the management of allergy patients are not covered. These supplies can be used for non -medical purposes, and are considered personal convenience items. Please refer to the Member's Benefit Booklet for availability of benefits regarding items used for non- medical purposes or personal convenience . Evidence -based clinical practice guidelines support the use of allergy immunotherapy for the management of allergic rhinitis, a topic dermatitis , allergic asthma, and Hymenoptera sensitivity (Hymenoptera sensitivity is an allergic reaction to venom of stinging insects such as wasps, hornets, bees, and fire ants.) . There is no published scientific evidence that immunotherapy is useful in treating food allergy, migraine headaches, vasomotor rhinitis, intrinsic (non- allergic) asthma, or chronic urticaria. In addition, there is little evidence that immunotherapy benefits angioedema. The major risk factor of allergy immunotherapy is anaphylaxis. Immunotherapy should be administered under the supervision of an appropriately trained physician who can recognize early signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and administer emergency medications if needed. Candidates for immunotherapy are patients whose symptoms are not controlled adequately by medications and avoidance measures or those experiencing unacceptable adverse effects of medications or who wish to reduce the long -term use of medications. Immunotherapy is recommended for patients with a history of a systemic reaction to Hymenoptera stings who demonstrate Hymenoptera -specific IgE antibodies. There is evidence that venom immunotherapy (VIT) might be effective in reducing large local reactions (LLRs) that might cause significant morbidity a nd impair quality of life. Rush immunotherapy is an accelerated immunotherapy build- up schedule that entails administering incremental doses of allergen at intervals varying between 15 and 60 minutes over 1 to 3 days until the target therapeutic dose is ac hieved. Rush immunotherapy schedules for inhalant allergens can be associated with a greater risk of systemic reactions, particularly in high -risk patients (eg, those with markedly positive prick/puncture or in vitro IgE test responses), and premedication primarily with antihistamines and corticosteroids appears to reduce the risk associated with rush immunotherapy. However, rush protocols for administration of stinging Hymenoptera VIT have not been associated with a simi larly high incidence of systemic reactions. The advantage of rush immunotherapy is that the therapeutic maintenance dose is achieved with fewer office visits in a shorter period of time. However, there is an increased risk of local and systemic reactions. The systemic reaction rate with rush immunotherapy schedules ranged from 15% to 100% of patients who did not receive premedication to 3% to 79% of premedicated patients in 1 review. In one double -blind, placebo -controlled study comparing the effect of prem edication before rush immunotherapy, systemic reactions were experienced by 27% by premedicated versus 73% of placebo- premedicated patients. Most reactions to rush immunotherapy are not severe, and the most common systemic reaction is usually flushing. Systemic reactions with rush schedules have been reported to occur up to 2 hours after the final injection. For that reason, subjects receiving rush immunotherapy should remain under a physician's supervision for a longer waiting period than the usual 30 minutes recommended for conventional schedules (eg, 1.5- 3 hours after allergen immunotherapy extract administration during rush immunotherapy). Page 4 of 11 An Independent Licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association Allergy Immunotherapy (Desen sitization) The most recent guidelines addressing allergy immunotherapy from the Joint Task Force on Practice Parameters, American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, Joint Council of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, state: \" Immunotherapy should be administered in a setting that permits the prompt recogniti on and management of adverse reactions. The preferred location for such administration is the prescribing physician's office. However, patients can receive immunotherapy injections at another health care facility if the physician and staff at that location are trained and equipped to recognize and manage immunotherapy reactions, particularly anaphylaxis. Patients should wait at the physician's office/medical clinic for at least 30 minutes after the immunotherapy injection or injections so that reactions can be recognized and treated promptly if they occur .\" Allerdent\u00ae is a new method of oral mucosal immunotherapy (OMIT) that delivers allergenic extracts to the tolerogenic oropharyngeal mucosa in the form of a compounded non- food based toothpaste, as a vehic le to treat seasonal allergic rhinitis. This glycerin -based fluoride toothpaste is formulated to specifically incorporate allergenic extracts and maintain their stability for at least 12 months at room temperature (Belvidere Labs, Highland Park, NJ). There are insufficient data to construct a chain of evidence that oral mucosal immunotherapy, specifically Allerdent\u00ae compounded toothpaste, would lead to improved health outcomes for patients compared with alterntive approaches to allergy immunotherapy. The evidence that is available consists of case reports and a published pilot study. Due to the lack of strong scientific evidence to support health outcomes for Allerdent\u00ae compounded toothpaste, the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the tec hnology on health outcomes.
