The first issue of the bibliography was published in July 1964; since that time, monthly supplements have been issued. In its subject coverage, Aerospace Medicine and Biology concentrates on the biological, physiological, psychological, and environmental effects to which man is subjected during and following simulated or actual flight in the earth's atmosphere or in interplanetary space. References describing similar effects of biological organisms of lower order are also in- cluded. Such related topics as sanitary problems, pharmacology, toxicology, safety and sur- vival, life support systems, exobiology, and personnel factors receive appropriate attention. In general, emphasis is placed on applied research, but references to fundamental studies and theoretical principles related to experimental development also qualify for inclusion. Each entry in the bibliography consists of a bibliographic citation accompanied in most cases by an abstract. The listing of the entries is arranged in two major sections: IAA Entries and STAR Entries. in that order. The citations, and abstracts when available, are reproduced exactly as they appeared originally in IAA or STAR, including the original accession numbers from the respective announcement journals. This procedure, which saves time and money, accounts for the slight variation in citation appearances. Two indexes-subject and personal author-are included. An annual index will be prepared at the end of the calendar year covering all documents listed in the 1974 Supplements. iii AVAILABILITY OF CITED PUBLICATIONS IAA ENTRIES (A74-10000 series) All publications abstracted in this Section are available from the Technical Information Service. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. Inc. (AIAA), as follows: Paper copies are available at $5.00 per document up to a maximum of 20 pages. The charge for each additional page is 25 cents. Microfiche (1) are available at the rate of $1.00 per microfiche for documents identified by the # symbol following the accession number. A number of publications, because of their special characteristics, are available only for reference in the AIAA Technical Information Service Library. Minimum airmail postage to foreign countries is $1.00. Please refer to the accession number, e.g.. A74-10763, when requesting publications. STAR ENTRIES (N74-10000 Series) A source from which a publication abstracted in this Section is available to the public is ordinarily given on the last line of the citation, e.g .Avail. NTIS. The following are the most commonly indicated sources (full addresses of these organizations are listed at the end of this introduction): Avail: NTIS. Sold by the National Technical Information Service at the price shown in the citation. If no price is shown in a current STAR citation, it may be ascertained by referring to Government Reports Announcements or to NTIS. Beginning with documents announced in Issue 21, 1973, \"stocked\" reports, such as printed NASA reports are priced on a step schedule ranging irregularly from $3.00 for a 1-to-25 page report to $11.00 for 576 to 600 pages, plus $2.00 for each additional 100-page increment. Demand print reports (those for which a facsimile reproduction will be made to fill orders) are priced at $4.00 for the first 20 pages plus 25 cents for each five pages or portions thereof. These prices are not applied retroactively; i.e., reports previously announced at a certain price continue to be sold at that price. If \"Avail: NTIS\" without a price appeared in the citation of a NASA report (asterisked) it is sold at $3.00 whether printed copy or facsimile is supplied. Because of price changes and possible surcharges, it is recommended that for any document announced in STAR before July 1970, NTIS be queried as to the price. Document prices are subject to change without notice. See \"Avail: SOD\" below for documents available from both the Superintendent of Documents and NTIS. Microfiche. Microfiche is available from NTIS at a standard price of $1.45 (regardless of age) for those documents identified by the # sign following the accession number (e.g., N74-10108#) and having an NTIS availability shown in the citation. Standing orders for microfiche of (1) the full collection of NTIS-available documents announced in STAR with the # symbol, (2) NASA reports only (ident- ified by an asterisk (*)), (3) NASA-accessioned non-NASA reports only (for those who wish to maintain an integrated microfiche file of aerospace documents by the \"N\" accession number), or (4) any of these classes within one or more STAR categories, also may be placed with NTIS at greatly reduced prices per title (e.g., 45 cents) over individual requests. Inquiries concerning NTIS Selective Categories in Microfiche should be addressed to the Subscription Unit, National Technical Information Service. Deposit Accounts and Customers Outside U.S. NTIS encourages its customers to open deposit accounts to facilitate the purchase of its documents now that prices vary so greatly. NTIS customers outside the United States are reminded that they should add the following handling and postage charges to the standard or announced prices: (1) A microfiche is a transparent sheet of film, 105 x 148 mm in size, containing up to 98 pages of information reduced to micro images (not to exceed 24.1 reduction). IV hard (paper) copy, $2.50 each document; microfiche, $1.50 each document. For subscribers outside the United States who receive microfiche through the Selective Categories in Microfiche program. NTIS will add 15 cents for each title shipped. Avail: SOD (or GPO). Sold by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office. in hard copy. The price is given following the availability line. (An order received by NTIS for one of these documents will be filled at the SOD price if hard copy is requested.

Montet demand for data concerning radiofrequency (RF) hazards to man, extensive information is now needed on the normal metabolites of experimental animals exposed to various RF fields. The metal content of blood plasma is known to respond to various thermal environments- This response is thought to be the primary means by which RF fields affect most biologic systems. X-ray fluorescence has recently been shown to be a feasible technique, by means of using lithium-drifted silicon or germanium solid-state detectors, for the simultaneous determina- tion of several metals in biologic samples. This report describes the source arrangement and calibration of such a fluorometer, as well as the calibration of the solid-state detectors in the 3.5 Key to 3.5 Mev energy region.
