This is achieved by rapid cooling inliquid nitrogen or propane. Protocols for protein crystal cryoprotection arebased on either increasing the environmental pressure or reducing the water fraction in the solvent. This study presents a new protocol for cryoprotecting crystals. It is based on vapour diffusion dehydration of the crystal drop to reducethe water fraction in the solvent by adding a highly concentrated salt solution,13Mpotassium formate (KF13), directly to the reservoir. Several salt solutions were screened to identify KF13 as optimal. Cryoprotection using the KF13protocol is non-invasive to the crystal, high throughput and easy to implement,can benet diffraction resolution and ligand binding, and is very useful in caseswith high redundancy such as drug-discovery projects which use very large compound or fragment libraries. An application of KF13 to discover new crystal hits from clear drops of equilibrated crystallization screening plates is alsoshown. 1. Introduction In macromolecular X-ray crystallography, it is important toperform data collection at cryogenic temperatures (usuallyaround 100 K) where crystal radiation damage is signicantlyslower, especially at high-intensity synchrotron radiationsources (Kmetko , 2006). Cryo- protection of loop-harvested crystals is intended to achieve water transition to vitreous ice before crystalline ice formation upon flash cooling in liquid nitrogen. Crystalline ice formationshould be avoided for a number of reasons. First, it compro-mises diffraction quality by destabilizing the crystal structuredue to its volume expansion compared with liquid water (Haas& Rossmann, 1970; Juers & Matthews, 2001, 2004; Kriminski et al., 2002; Low et al., 1966). These effects cause disorder and/or non-isomorphism. Second, it causes large variations in the background counts of diffraction images due to X-ray diffraction by cubic and hexagonal ice at specic Thorn et al. 2017). There are two main strategies to cryoprotect macro- molecular crystals, which aim either (i) to increase the envir-onmental pressure (Burkhardt et al. , 2012; Kim et al. , 2005; Thomanek et al., 1973) or (ii) to reduce the solvent fraction to below the glass transition phase of water (Pflugrath, 2015). Reduction of solvent fraction can be achieved by either (i)soaking crystals in cryosolutions enriched with cryoprotectiveagents such as sugars, polyethylene glycols, glycerol andvarious al., 2003; Hope, 1988; Marshall et al., Pemberton et al., 2000; Vera & Stura, 2014; Kwong & Liu, 1999) or (ii) dehydration. While in some cases an adequatecryoprotective agent is already present in the crystallizationbuffer, very often an additional step needs to be performedwhere the crystal is transferred to a cryoprotected solution;this process can be laborious and damaging to the crystals dueto handling and osmotic stress, respectively. Crystal handling is avoided in procedures that make use of acoustic nanodroplet ejectors ( e.g.the Echo acoustic liquid handler from Labcyte Inc.) for precise placement of cryoprotective agents directlywithin the crystallization drop but away from the crystals andtowards the drop edges to allow gradual gentle diffusion;however, the setup of such a pipeline is neither straightfor-ward nor inexpensive, including the requirement for crystalplate imaging facilities (Collins et al., 2017). In addition, a low- throughput but efcient protocol has been reported for crystal cryoprotection using vapour diffusion of volatile alcohols(Farley & Juers, 2014). Dehydration studies of macro-molecular crystals have instead usually been aimed atimproving data resolution rather than cryoprotection(Abergel, 2004; sauer et al. , 2000). However, two of these studies have also reported that some crystals, dehydrated either using a humidity control device (Sanchez-Weatherby et al. , 2009; Bowler et al. , 2015) or by replacing the reservoir in the crys- tallization plate with NaCl solutions (Douangamath et al. , 2013), no longer required being soaked in cryosolutions toprevent crystalline ice formation during flash cooling. Besides the main two strategies discussed above, there is a third option which relies on removing all the liquidsurrounding the crystal before flash freezing, with the crystal structure itself acting as the cryoprotectant; however, this method is limited to crystals with solvent channels smallerthan about 40 A , otherwise formation of internal ice cannot be avoided in the absence of cryoprotecting conditions (Pelle-grini et al. , 2010; Thorne et al. , 2003). In this study, a new cryoprotection protocol is described in which a solution of 13 Mpotassium formate (KF13) is added in a single step directly to the plate reservoir. This dehydrates the crystal drop overnight by vapour diffusion, thereby cryo- protecting the crystal. This method has successfully cryo-protected six different crystal systems, which were grown inconditions containing different salts and polyethylene glycols.The amount of KF13 added to achieve cryoprotection, withoutover-dehydrating the crystal at the expense of diffractionquality, depends on both the components of the crystallizationsolution and the crystal solvent content. It is shown to vary between 4 and 20% of the nal volume (reservoir plus KF13). This work also shows that adding KF13 to the reservoir of previously equilibrated crystallization screening plates canpromote, through further dehydration by vapour diffusion, theformation of new crystals from 'idled' clear drops. Thisapproach provides a new high-throughput protocol to recycleunsuccessful crystallization screening conditions. Clear dropsusually account for around 50% of all conditions in a crys- tallization screening experiment.2. Materials and methods 2.1. Chemicals and protein crystals Precipitants, such as polyethylene glycols and salts, buffers, and chemicals to prepare dehydrating solutions such as potassium formate were all purchased from Sigma. Thecommercially available proteins Thaumatococcus daniellii (an African plant) zyme and Canavalia ensiformis (jack bean) concanavalin A were also purchased from Sigma. Crystals of Staphylococcus aureus FtsA laments, Homo sapiens hetero-pentamer Cenp- OPQUR complex and glutamate receptor ligand-binding domain in complex with agonist (GluLBD) were kindly donated by MRC Laboratory of Molecular (LMB)researchers Danguole Ciziene, Stan Yatskevich and ChristinaHeroven, respectively. Crystallization on a Mosquito nanolitre liquid handler (STPLabtech) at 293 K by dispensing equal volumes (200 nl) ofprotein and reservoir solutions. For the study of cryo-protection by dehydration, crystals of lysozyme, concanavalin A and thaumatin were prepared at various precipitant concentrations, both to study the direct effects of precipitantconcentration on cryoprotection and to produce crystals ofdifferent sizes, since crystal size can also affect cryoprotection;larger crystals are known to require a higher concentrationand/or longer soaking time of cryoprotectant, since the coolingrate in liquid nitrogen may not be fast enough for the deeperareas in the crystal to avoid formation of ordered crystalline ice (Schall et al. , 2005). To differentiate between samples of the same protein crystallized at different precipitant concen-trations, the following acronyms are used thisarticle: (i) lyso07, lyso08 and lyso12 describe lysozyme (ii) conc13 and conc14 represent 6K, respectively; and (iii) thau06 andthau10 describe thaumatin crystals grown in 0.6 and 1.0 M NaK tartrate, respectively. Detailed lists have been tabulated of the crystallization conditions for the study of cryoprotectionby dehydration (Table 1) and for the promotion of crystalnucleation in already vapour diffusion equilibrated crystaldrops (Table S1 in the supporting information). 2.2. Dehydration of crystallization drops Protein crystallization was carried out in 96-well MRC plates (SWISS-CI) containing 80 ml of reservoir solutions. This type of plate accommodates up to 100 ml of reservoir. Required volumes of KF13, ranging from 0-20 ml, were added directly to the reservoir by either (i) removing the sealing tapecompletely and using a multi-channel pipette before quicklyre-sealing the whole plate with three-inch-wide Crystal Clearsealing tape (Hampton Research), in the case of high-throughput experiments such as the study of promoting crystalnucleation in already equilibrated clear drops, or (ii) making a small cross incision in the sealing tape with a blade and using a single-channel pipette, before re-sealing the cut with asmall piece of Crystal Clear tape, in the case of low-throughput experiments such as the study of cryoprotection byresearch of FtsA, Cenp-OPQUR and GluLBD, due to the limited amounts of the samples, experi-ments were performed only once. In contrast, with thecommercially available samples, experiments were performedin duplicate (thaumatin) or triplicate concentrations of precipitants usedin crystallization did vary slightly amongst the replicate platesto produce crystals of different sizes (see previous section and Table 1). 2.3. Theoretical calculations of relative humidity The relationship between the precipitant solution and equilibrium relative humidity (RH) is described by Raoult'slaw for the equilibrium vapour pressure of water above a solution (Wheeler et al. , 2012). The concentration of buffers, additives and detergents used will have a negligible effect onthe RH in equilibrium with the mother liquor, and the RH isdominated by the primary precipitant. The theoretical RHvalues for the solutions used in this study were calculatedusing the applet at https://www.esrf.fr/UsersAndScience/Experiments/MX/How_to_use_our_beamlines/forms(Wheeler et al. 2015, 2017). 2.4. Diffraction collection Single diffraction images were acquired on beamline I24 (Diamond Light Source) and the home source (FrE+SuperBright, Rigaku) for crystals of Cenp-OPQUR and GluLBD, respectively. Complete data sets were collected for crystals of FtsA on beamline I24 and of lysozyme, concana-valin A and thaumatin on I04 (Diamond Light Source). All diffraction data were collected at 100 K and autoprocessedwith Xia2 DIALS (Winter et al. , 2018). 3. Results and discussion 3.1. KF13 is an ideal solution for crystal drop dehydration by vapour diffusion All crystallization plates used in this study are 96-well MRC plates. These allow a maximum reservoir volume of 100 ml. Ready-to-use crystallization screening plates prepared at theLMB crystallization facility contain 80 ml of reservoir in each well (signicantly lower volumes are not ideal for storing at 283 K due to evaporation issues), allowing the addition of amaximum of 20 ml of extra solution. To achieve further dehydration of equilibrated crystal drops via vapour diffusionby adding some 0-20 ml solution to the reservoir, the overall vapour pressure of water for 80 ml of reservoir plus xmlo f highly concentrated solution (where xequals 0-20) must be lower than that for the original 80 ml reservoir (since the vapour pressure of an equilibrated crystal drop is approxi- mately the same as that of the reservoir). Therefore, tocounteract the diluting effect that adding extra solution has onthe original reservoir, and to prevent rehydration rather thandehydration, the mole fraction of water of the added solutionmust be very low (since the reservoir already contains highconcentrations of precipitants). A schematic drawing of thisprocess is shown in Fig. 1.

Interestingly, it was not possible to achieve the reported maximum solubility at room temperature of mostof the tested substances. Thus, the tests were carried out at the maximum achievable solubility without heating the solutions to reach higher concentrations (in this way the solution ismore stable and can be stored indenitely at room tempera-ture without the problem of the solute precipitating if there isa reduction in temperature) (Table 2). Solutions of caesiumacetate and fructose were excluded due to their expense andbeing too viscous for pipetting, respectively (Table 2). NaCl, Kacetate, CsCl and Cs phosphate failed to dehydrate a large number of crystallization drops whose reservoirs possessed an RH above the solution of 93% or less, whereas KNO 2was excluded because it reacted with solutions containing(NH 4)2SO 2SO 4+4 H 2O] as judged by the bubbling reservoir, which caused the sealing tape to open up in some places due tothe build-up of pressure in the well (Table 2). Solutions of10MLi iodide and 13 MK formate (KF13) proved to be equally efcient in causing crystal drop dehydration in all crystallization conditions tested (Table 2). However, KF13 waschosen as the preferred solution because it is ten times lessexpensive than Li iodide. Fig. 2 shows how adding 20 mlo f KF13 to different 80 ml reservoirs containing different preci- pitants at different concentrations signicantly dehydrated allcrystal drops. 3.2. Cryoprotection by KF13 dehydration Tests were conducted using six different protein samples, namely FtsA, Cenp-OPQUR, GluLBD, lysozyme, concana-valin A and thaumatin different sizeswere produced for lysozyme, concanavalin A and thaumatin by varying the precipitant concentrations (Table 1 and Fig. S1). Crystal drops were dehydrated by adding 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15 or20ml of KF13 directly to the reservoirs (80 ml) and leaving them to equilibrate for 12-24 h. Crystals were then harvestedresearch Dehydrating effects on crystallization drops from signicantly different conditions after 24 h from adding KF13 to the reservoirs.

Despite the crystal solvent content being as high as 72%, crystals from dropscontaining polyethylene glycols (ranging from 8-20%) onlyrequired 4-10 ml of KF13 to achieve cryoprotection. In the case of drops containing salts as precipitants, the amounts ofKF13 required were markedly higher, being in the range of15-20 ml, despite solvent contents as low as 32%. This is in agreement with the fact that the concentrations of polyethyl- ene glycols in crystallization solutions are usually closer to those required to act as cryoprotectants than in the case ofsalts (Berejnov et al., 2006). As shown in Table 3, the variation in the size of the lysozyme and thaumatin crystals (Table 1 andFig. S1) did not appear to have any effect on cryoprotection. Most important is the fact that this protocol has achievedcryoprotection even in cases where the precipitant is a verypoor cryoprotectant, such as NaCl (Berejnov et al. , 2006), suggesting that this KF13-based approach can be applied tocrystals grown in most, if not all, crystallization conditionscurrently in use in macromolecular crystallography. In thisstudy the diameters of the harvesting nylon loops were chosen to be an approximate match to the size of the crystal, and the X-ray beam cross section was smaller than the crystal size(Fig. S1). Complete data sets were collected for FtsA, lysozyme, concanavalin A and thaumatin crystals. In all cases, diffractiondata processing showed a strong correlation between thedisappearance of the ice rings, lower mosaicity and higherresolution (Fig. 9), as well as the order in the crystals as judged by the average Wilson Bfactor (Fig. S2). Continuing to increase the amount of KF13 past the point of ice ringdisappearance eventually caused an increased mosaicity andresearch protocol of KF13 volumes required to achieve cryoprotection by vapour diffusion dehydration in crystals grown from different conditions and with different solvent contents. The/C1RH column shows the difference between the RH values of the starting reservoir (Table 1) and after adding KF13 (this table).

This also appeared to be true in the case of the single-image datacollections from the GluLBD and Cenp-OPQUR samples, asjudged from the deterioration in resolution in the diffractionimages of crystals from drops dehydrated with KF13 volumes above the optimal 4 and 10 ml, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5). The overall amounts of KF13 that can be added to achieve optimalcryoprotection without degrading the diffraction resolutioncan vary signicantly depending on the sample, ranging from anarrow 8-10 ml interval for FtsA crystals to a wider 5-15 ml for concanavalin A crystals (Fig. 9). As expected, crystal drop dehydration induced a shrinkage of the unit cell of the crystals that is proportional to the amount of KF13 added to the reservoir, except in the case of thaumatin where no contraction of the unit cell was observed,perhaps suggesting a very rigid structure (Figs. S3 and S4). Allother samples underwent an anisotropic contraction of theunit cell, except concanavalin A crystals, where all three unit-cell axes shrank (Figs. S3 and S4). As reported in the Intro- duction , unit-cell shrinkage and the consequent reduction in the solvent content of crystals by dehydration has been exploited in a number of cases to improve crystal order, and thus the diffraction resolution, especially with crystals ofmembrane proteins crystallized with detergents. Therefore,cryoprotection by KF13 dehydration may also lead to improved crystal order and better diffraction resolutioncompared with other cryoprotection techniques that do notcause the unit cell to shrink. Since unit-cell shrinkage is shownto be proportional to the added volume of KF13, the overallamount of KF13 required to achieve full cryoprotection ( e.g. 6ml) could be added gradually ( e.g.2ml every 24 h), thereby achieving a more gradual and gentler contraction of the unit cell and optimal diffraction resolution in certain cases. The KF13 cryoprotection method is ideal for crystal- lographic drug discovery projects for a number of reasons. (i) In standard cryoprotection protocols the crystal is transferred to a drop containing a cryoprotective agent, whichideally should also contain the ligand of interest; however, itcan be very labour intensive to prepare all the differentcryoprotectant solutions, each containing a unique ligand (or even cocktails of ligands) from a large library for each different ligand-complex crystal. This is unnecessary with theKF13 method since the crystallization solution remainsuntouched. (ii) Since KF13 cryoprotection is achieved by dehydration, the concentration of the ligand in the drop will rise, causingthe binding occupancies to increase and thus improving theprobability of observing the ligand in the electron-density map. This latter consideration is also true in the case of ab initio structure determination experiments involving metal atom soaks.research papers 376 Dom Bellini/C15A cryoprotection protocol J. Appl. Cryst. (2022). 55, 370-379 Figure 9 Correlation between amounts of KF13 used for crystal drop dehydration and both mosaicity and diffraction resolution of data sets collected for diffe rent crystal samples. The green line indicates the minimum value of KF13 volume that caused the ice rings to disappear.(iii) While the KF13 method works well in low-throughput experiments, it is also ideal for very large projects such asscreening large libraries of compounds or fragments. In thesecases, high throughput can be achieved by adding KF13 eithermanually using multi-channel pipettes or via an automatedpipeline using liquid-handling robots. The crystal drop dehydration method of replacing the reservoir with an NaCl solution (Douangamath et al. , 2013) was developed with the aim of rapidly screening the effects of dehydration on the diffraction resolution of crystals in situ . The KF13 protocol is also perfectly suited for such a purpose,with the advantage that KF13 is added in a single step withoutnecessitating prior removal of the reservoir. 3.3. KF13 can aid crystal hit discovery by dehydrating clear drops in pre-equilibrated screening plates Standard protocols for the identication of new crystal hits consist of screening more than one or two thousand differentcrystallization conditions, normally using 96-well plates. Animportant parameter in this process is the choice of protein concentration, which, as a rule of thumb, is taken as the concentration that produces around 50% of clear drops(intended as no observable protein precipitation) immediatelyafter setting up the plates. This means that in any given crystalhit screening experiment, even after achieving drop equili-bration by vapour diffusion, there are usually a high percen-tage of drops that are left clear, with neither crystals norprecipitation. There are a number of reasons why drops remain clear. One is that the concentration of protein or precipitant, or both, is not high enough to reach super-saturation and consequently nucleation. The growth of crys-tals from clear drops weeks, months or even years after theplates had been set up is likely to be due either to waterevaporation from the reservoir through a small leak in thesealing tape (or greased cover slip) and/or to proteolysis. KF13dehydration can be employed to mimic, while speeding up, this slow evaporation process, thus allowing the discovery of new crystal hits in screening plates that had already reachedvapour diffusion equilibration. To investigate this possibility,96-well crystallization plates for lysozyme and thaumatin wereprepared where some of the drops contained too low aconcentration of either protein or precipitant (or both) toreach supersaturation. After 10 days, when crystal growth hadnot been observed for several days, xed amounts of KF13 (3ml) were gradually added to the reservoirs every 3 days using a multi-channel pipette. Table 4 summarizes howincreasing amounts of KF13 were required for crystal growthin drops with decreasing amounts of protein or precipitant (orboth). Notably, the optimized crystallization conditions usedto prepare lysozyme and thaumatin crystals for the KF13cryoprotection studies discussed above contained a minimumof 0.7 MNaCl and 0.6 MNaK tartrate, respectively, via KF13 of pre-equilibrated crys- tallization plates produced crystal hits in drops containing aslittle as 0.1 MNaCl and 0.05 MNaK tartrate (lower precipi- tant concentrations than these were not tested) (Table 4). As anegative control, the sealing tape was removed from duplicate plates, which were then left open for the same length of time aswas required to add KF13 and reseal the original plates. Nofurther crystal growth was observed in the control platesbeyond that observed within the rst 10 days of vapourdiffusion equilibration. This proves that the new crystal hitswere indeed the result of KF13 drop dehydration, rather than an effect of water evaporation due to the removal of the sealing tape for about 30 s (which is roughly the time requiredto add KF13 to all the reservoirs in a 96-well plate using amulti-channel pipette). Note that both the lysozyme and the thaumatin samples used in the above experiments were prepared by dissolvinglyophilized protein into simple water. This is in contrast to thetypical approach whereby protein samples used in crystal- lization contain salts, buffers and protocol 377Table 4 Summary of KF13 volumes required to be added to pre-equilibrated crystallization plates to initiate crystal nucleation in clear drops of (top)lysozyme and (bottom) thaumatin with different precipitant concentra- tions. Crystallization plates were left to equilibrate for 10 days before 3 ml of KF13 were added at intervals of 3 days; plates were monitored daily after the rst10 days of equilibration without adding any KF13.

Therefore, the procedureof KF13 dehydration of clear drops is different from that of setting up new crystallization plates using a protein sample of higher concentration than the one used in the original plates. Another important aspect that needed to be assessed was whether KF13 dehydration of crystallization screening dropsmight cause the appearance of a high number of false positivesdue to the crystallization of different salts present in most ofthe crystallization conditions. To investigate this, the twopopular Index (Qiagen) and JCSG+ (Hampton) sparse-matrix crystallization screens were set up using a protein-less sample containing only 10 m MTris-HCl pH 8 and 300 m MNaCl (200 + 200 nl sitting drops and 80 ml of reservoir); the eight 96- well plates (four for each screen) were left to reach equili-brium by vapour diffusion for one week. Subsequently, theseplates were unsealed and 5, 10, 15 and 20 ml of KF13 were quickly added to the reservoirs of each screen, respectively,before resealing the plates. Inspection over the next 7 days showed that none of the drops contained any crystals, either from salt or from other compounds present in the manydifferent drop conditions. This proves that KF13 dehydrationis unlikely to cause an issue with false positives in hit screeningexperiments. It also suggests that proteins play a crucial role inthe nucleation and subsequent crystallization of salts, which isin agreement with the fact that salt crystals are commonlyobtained from different crystallization conditions depending on the specic protein sample used in the screen. 4. Conclusions This work shows that six different crystal systems weresuccessfully cryoprotected by dehydration of the crystal drop via vapour diffusion. This was achieved by adding a veryhighly concentrated salt solution directly to the reservoir,without the need to manipulate the crystal drop. Screening ofvarious salt solutions showed that 13 Mpotassium formate (KF13) possesses the ideal vapour pressure of water comparedwith other tested candidates to create a one-step cryo-protection protocol, since small amounts of KF13 between only 4 and 20% of the nal volume (reservoir plus KF13) sufced to achieve complete cryoprotection in all six crystalforms tested. Being able to limit the added KF13 volumewithin this range is very important because it means that areservoir volume of up to 80% of the well capacity can be used in crystallization experiments without the need to remove anyof the reservoir to achieve cryoprotection by directly addingKF13 in a single step. Being able to add KF13 without the need to remove any of the reservoir means that the crystal- lization plate remains unsealed for shorter times (minimizingcrystal drop evaporation and consequently giving morecontrol over the experiment outcome and reproducibility) andall the procedures are faster to complete. Although a one-stepcryoprotection protocol could also be developed using othersalt solutions with a higher vapour pressure of water thanKF13, thus having smaller volumes of reservoir in the well and hence allowing the addition of larger volumes of the dehy- drating solution, it is preferable to keep the volume of reser-voir to a reasonable level ( e.g.around 60-80 ml in a 96-well MRC plate from SWISS-CI), since too little reservoir in thewell can dry out too quickly during storage ( e.g.pre-lled plates stored at 283 K in our crystallization facility) or evenduring crystallization screening experiments at roomtemperature. As summarized in Table 5, the KF13 protocol for protein crystal cryoprotection possesses all the qualities of an idealmethod, such as being high throughput (unlike protocols forcrystal freezing under high pressure or vapour diffusion ofvolatile alcohols), non-labour intensive (unlike the use ofcryoproctective agents in a drug discovery screening experi-ment, where a different cryosolution would need to beprepared for each different compound/ligand) and non- invasive (no crystal handling during transfer into new cryo- solution drops) and not causing drop dilution by addingcryoprotective agents using an acoustic dispenser (in the caseof bound ligands this weakens binding afnities). The method described by Douangamath et al. (2013), which is carried out in two steps, by rst completely removing thecrystallization reservoir in the well and then replacing thiswith a solution containing NaCl, scores similarly to the KF13 protocol (Table 5). This NaCl method may be suitable for small-scale projects where the manual procedure can becarried out by making a small incision in the sealing tape tominimize evaporation while executing the two steps. However,in high-throughput cases where the sealing tape is removedcompletely to gain easy access to all 96 wells, the crystal dropsremain exposed to evaporation for considerably longer thanduring a single-step procedure. Resealing the plate quickly is key to achieving a slow and controlled dehydration. Moreover,research papers 378 Dom Bellini/C15A cryoprotection protocol J. Appl. Cryst.

Cryoprotection by KF13 is very useful for drug discovery projects that are characterized by high crystal form redun-dancy ( e.g.the amount of KF13 to be added to the reservoir to achieve optimal cryoprotection only needs to be established once) and many different ligands (which do not need to be added to KF13 since this is added to the reservoir rather thanthe drops). Also, dehydration of drops in KF13 cryoprotectioncan improve the ligand occupancy and/or diffraction resolution. This study has also shown that crystallization drops in pre- equilibrated plates potentially capable of producing crystalsbut containing too little of either protein or precipitant (orboth) can be pushed into supersaturation, nucleation and crystal growth by exerting further vapour diffusion dehydra- tion by adding KF13 to the reservoir. This aspect has appli-cation in crystallization screening experiments (both smallscale and high throughput) where 'idled' clear drops in platesthat have already reached equilibration can be rapidly testedfor being undersaturated by adding KF13 to the reservoir. The supporting information contains gures and tables showing unit-cell contraction upon dehydration by KF13 and crystallization plate setups, respectively, as discussed in the text.
