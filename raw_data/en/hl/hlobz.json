Medical Director [Meet Dr. Andrew Nish](#) Andrew Nish, MD, serves as medical director of John Stoddard Cancer Center. As medical director, Dr. Nish is an important link to the medical team and works to facilitate discussions around quality, clinical trials and patient care enhancements. Dr. Nish is featured in the [Dish with Nish Podcast](/locations/unitypoint-health---john-stoddard-cancer-center#podcast). Dr. Nish graduated from Carleton College and received his medical degree from the Chicago Medical School. He completed his residency in Diagnostic Radiology and a fellowship in Interventional Radiology at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. Following his fellowship, he moved to Des Moines and began a 27-year career as an Interventional Radiologist at Iowa Methodist Medical Center. During that time he introduced many new procedures to the medical center including peripheral arterial stents, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts, chemo and radioembolization of liver tumors and microwave ablation of tumors in many locations. Despite his successful career he became restless and began to question the care model of traditional western style medicine. A retrospective analysis of his 27-year career revealed the fact that patient health was not getting better and that the traditional care model was failing patients and their families. With this new insight he began to study nutrition, stress, exercise and sleep as it related to health and wellness. He went on to enroll in a 2-year fellowship at the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, completing his studies in October of 2018. His passion is to educate the public and healthcare workers about true health and well-being and how this can be achieved through lifestyle changes, including: - food and nutrition - stress management - sleep - exercise - purpose in life - social relationships. He is fascinated with the mind-body connection and how our thoughts and beliefs directly influence our physical and mental health.

Beyond these vital treatments, we believe complementary evidence-based services can help relieve symptoms and side-effects as well as improve the efficacy of conventional treatments. This is the foundation of the Charlie Cutler Healing and Wellness Program. Alongside conventional medicine, there is great power in complementary therapies that support the mind, body and spirit for patients and caregivers. \"Integrative Oncology is about supporting the body's innate capacity to heal through the use of complementary therapies which incorporate healing practices designed to support the whole patient, both mind and body.

Stoddard [The Legacy of John D. Stoddard](#) John Stoddard was an engineer by training and a real estate developer and entrepreneur by profession who amassed a large fortune and gave most of it away. He often said that the reason he worked so hard to make money was to have more to give away. In 1990, his keen interest in medical care and compassion for others compelled him to support Iowa Methodist Medical Center's new cancer center with a $4 million gift. In recognition of his generosity, the center was named the John Stoddard Cancer Center. As the state-of-the-art center was constructed, John, an engineer, kept close watch. From the moment the first steel beams were erected, John saw \"outstanding architecture\" emerge. He gained a sense of satisfaction that came from supporting a facility specifically designed to offer feelings of life, health and hope. John was always a fervent ambassador for the center, spreading his enthusiasm for the new and emerging technology, expert cancer researchers and caregivers and personalized family-centered care. Shortly before his cancer diagnosis, John said, \"Once you see the center, once you see the remarkable work that's being done, that's what really motivates you to give. There's such an attitude of hope.\" Through his ongoing gifts to the center, as well as significant provisions made in his estate plan, John Stoddard's spirit of hope will continue to benefit cancer patients and their families for generations to come. Join Us for Rally Against Cancer [About Rally Against Cancer](#) The annual Rally Against Cancer fundraising event is held every January and includes a silent and live auction, dinner and presentation by a special guest speaker. Since the first Rally Against Cancer in 2000, the event has grown from a small super bowl party for friends to John Stoddard Cancer Center's signature fundraiser, hosting over 600 attendees. Each year, thousands of patients and families benefit from the funds raised at Rally. Rally Against Cancer was created out of the love for a mother, Helen Hampton, who lost her battle with cancer in 1997. Her daughter, Kim Johnson, was so impressed with the treatment, compassion and overall coordinated care that her mother and her family received during Helen's battle with cancer that she approached the Stoddard Cancer Center about establishing an event to raise money and awareness for the patients and families at Stoddard Cancer Center.
