Pfizer Inc said on Wednesday that final results from the late-stage trial of its COVID-19 vaccine show it was 95% effective, adding that it had the required two months of safety data and would apply for emergency U.S. authorization within days. Optimism over vaccines has boosted risk sentiment and helped to send benchmark 10-year yields to eight-month highs last week. But the rollout of any vaccine will likely take time, and the U.S. government is unlikely to launch new fiscal stimulus until at least next year, which will weigh on the economy in the interim. \"We're really in an environment where the market is trading off of two distinct narratives. One is we have a vaccine, we'll get back to normal, buy stocks. The other is because cases are increasing rather dramatically we need more from Congress, so buy bonds,\" said Ian Lyngen, head of U.S. rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. Benchmark 10-year yields fell one basis point to 0.860%, after reaching 0.975% last week. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year notes was little changed on the day at 69 basis points. Data on Wednesday showed that U.S. homebuilding increased more than expected in October, suggesting the housing market continues to be sustained by historically low mortgage rates. The Treasury Department will sell $27 billion in 20-year bonds on Wednesday and $12 billion in 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) on Thursday.
