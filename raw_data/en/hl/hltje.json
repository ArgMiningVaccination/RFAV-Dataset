Printed in the United States of America ii4 I dedicate this book to my father, Harold M. Pitt,whose life is my example. Preface Over the years I have been blessed with a husband and three children, three college degrees. and sixteenyears teaching experience in Washington. Japan. California. Massachusetts, Maryland. and Tur!cey. Followingmy husband around the world. first when he was a graduate student and later as a federal government employee,has led to a variety of experiences. Of these, several stand out. Dr. H. Weston Blaser. now deceased, my advisor and professor at the University of Washington in Seattle.greatly influenced my approach to intellectual growth at i pedagogical method. Former students of his willrecognize some of his methods within this laboratory manual. Sr. Patricia Cu lhane. also now deceased, while headmistress of the International School of the Sacred Heartin Tokyo, Japan, encouraged creative curriculum development and urged development of an advanced biologyprogram which would combine the use of American textbooks with the needs of those who had experiencedthe British form system. It was a joy to teach biology to stude.nts who already had completed chemistry, butit also was a constant challenge to conduct laboratories appropriate for older students with a chemistry back-ground. While at Sacred Heart I developed the-nucleus for many of the laboratories included in this manual.Sr. Culhane asked. when we left Tokyo, that I continue to develop the laboratories and my ideas on advancedbiology for high school students. Sr. Culhane, I have done so. The Howard County Maryland Public Schools. particularly Barbara Jewett, science department head atOakland Mills High School, and Paul M. Keyser. science director for the Howard County Maryland Public Schools.provided the freedom and the classes which allowed to test and perfect the laboratories in this manual.This effort reflects the strivings for excellence of the Howard County school system. Dr. Roland S. Nardone and Rene Filipowski of the Catholic University of America in Washington. D. C.gave the training I needed to prepare the laboratory on heterokaryons for high school students. Rene alsodeveloped the procedural steps and materials lists for the heterokaryon laboratory. Dr. Yahya Laleli of Duzen Laboratories in Ankara, Turkey provided the technical information required tocomplete the laboratory on gel electrophoresis techniques. Mrs. Judy Swanson of the George C. Marshall School in Ankara, Turkey prepared all illustrations for thismanual. Mr. Clark S. Carlile. the publisher, deserves a ,Jecial thanks for assisting me in this project. I shudder tothink how this book might have appeared without his constant good judgement and sure hand. My husband, Ted C. Davis, most especially deserves credit for all that he has done. Quite simply, this bookmight not have been written without him. Not only did he pressure me to approach a publisher in the firstplace, but he spent most evenings. weekends, and holidays over the course of a year reviewing every wordand critiquing every entry. It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge a debt to my husband and to thank himfor all his forbearance with the computer and me. Finally, I would like to thank my students over the years. After all. this book is for them. v Note to Users Biology, the study of life, is a vast and complex subject, and one in which knowledge is rapidly expanding.The needs of both instructors and students, who face a wide range of possible topics, were considered duringthe selection of laboratories for this manual. Those areas of biology not adequately introduced in first yearhigh school courses received more focus. Upon completion of this manual, in conjunction with an appropriatetext, the student will have finished the equivalent of a university first year biology course and should be pre-pared to sit for the biology advanced placement examination administered by the Education Testing Service.Action Biology, Advanced Placement for the Second Year. like Action Biology for the First Year. is the resultof years of classroom use and testing with high school biology students.Design AssumptionsAction Biology, Advanced Placement for the Second Year. is designed for the student who has completedfirst year biology. It also is designed for the student who has completed chemistry, or who, at the minimum,is enrolled concurrently in chemistry. Although basic biology and chemistry are essential for effective utilizationof this manual, physics is optional. Those discussions and laboratories which require some knowledge of physicsare supplied with necessary background information.This manual is designed to be used in conjunction with any of the university introductory biology textbookscurrently on the market. Action Biology, Advanced Placement for the Second Year, is divided into one hourlaboratory periods, but those schools with a two hour period, or even the three or four hour college laboratory,can use the manual simply by covering several one hour blocks during a single laboratory session.The number of laboratories included in this manual exceeds those required during the course of a typicalacademic year by even the most strongly laboratory oriented instructor. With extra laboratories available, eachclass can wind its own path through the material, selecting those for which the school has appropriate equipment,facilities, growing conditions, and preferences. Choices may be made from the four general groupings of labora-tories and discussions, which range from the sub-cellular to the socia' from the descriptive to the experimental.The four parts are: 1. Instrumentation in the Study of the Cell, 2. Diversity of Life and Reproduction, 3. AnimalGrowth and Behavior, and 4. Plant Growth Relationships.The manual also is self-contained. It includes background information specific to the instrument orprocedure, full discussion of laboratory preparations, detailed procedural steps, places for students toenter data and discuss issues, suggestions for further projects, review quizzes, answer keys, etc. All inone, the teacher and student no longer must juggle several different manuals.Student ObjectivesStudents are urged to review the objectives listed at the beginning of each laboratory or discussion andto determine, after completion of the unit, if they have accomplished those objectives. Also, students shouldreview the terminology listed at the conclusion of each unit to verify that they know the listed words. Defini-tions for all words listed in the terminology sections are found in the glossary, Appendix A of this manual.Students may have to review portions of first year biology, or find access to a scientific dictionary, becauseit was assumed, when preparing the terminology lists and glossary, that terms introduced during the first yearwere learned at that time. Every subject has its own technical terminology, and biology is no exception. Stu-dents will have to know the terms which belong to the subject.Time LineAction, Biology, Advanced Placement for the Second Year. is designed to be used in fifty to sixty minutesegments. These egments may be spaced daily, as in the most typical school schedule, or by unit, as in twoto four hour b1(AS of time during the week. Even the discussion units, included because texts generally donot cover those Lopics in sufficient depth for effective laboratory utilization, are designed around the one hourtime block. vi Each of the four parts of the manual require from twenty two to twenty six hours of laboratory time tocomplete. The shor:zst laboratories are in the first part, Instrumentation in the Study of Cells. As students becomeaccustomed to working with one another and handling increasingly complex experiments, the laboratories tendto become longer and require greater student organization and team effort. By part three, Animal Growth andBehavior, students are required not only to interact with classmates but also to observe the larger schoolcommunity. In part four, Plant Growth Relationships, there is an experiment on the flowering response in plantswhich requires the entire class to coordinate and schedule a group effort. This experiment is part of a muchlarger laboratory which intermittently runs for one month.Instrumentation in the Study of CellsThe four parts of the manual are designd to minimize the problems of a typical school year, in that partone, instrumentation in the Study of Cells, begins with discussion sections and suggestions for teacher demon-strations. It then covers some basic materials which should have been introduced during the first year biologycourse, but it does so in greater depth and in ways designed to acquaint the student with equipment andinstrumentation techniques used in more advanced biological studies. It is believed that every student shouldacquire facility with scientific instruments. The instructor is urged to make every effort to expose the studentsto as many of the laboratories in part one as is economically and physically possible. If complete coverageis not feasible, a thorough reading of the discussion units would still be useful. Over the years a stock of instru-ments should be acquired by your school.Diversity of Life and ReproductionThe laboratories in part two, Diversity of Life and Reproduction, are primarily descriptive, and cover phylanormally not explored in a first year course. Students will acquire a fuller understanding of life processes andthe great diversity of life forms, as well as master new laboratory techniques. Again, the discussions in.the labora-tories are designed to cover material pertinent to the topics covered within a laboratory but not normally discussedin standard textbooks. You may observe in this section that I have rearranged some classifications within theplant kingdom in ways which are taxonomically more accurate in terms of evolutionary relationships, and alsomore logical when the plant kingdom is viewed in its entirety. Write care of the publisher and tell me whatyou think.Animal Growth and BehaviorPart three, Animal Growth and Behavior, contains primarily experimental laboratories, from a traditionaldescriptive dissection of a cat, to the latest in biological inquiry, the creation of hybridomas and monoclonalantibodies. This part of the manual takes the student from the cellular level to vertebrate behavior. Studentshave the opportunity to consider ethological issues and patterns of social organization.Again, the manual is designed to minimize the problems of a typical school year, in that the last laboratoryin part three is a paper and pencil exercise available to the instructor who must begin year-end closing of thelaboratory at this point. Assuming that all instruments required for part one were available, and further assum-ing that your school schedules five hours per week in science, you might be able to cover in their entirety onlyparts one, two, and three of this manual. If, because of equipment shortages or personal preferences, you haveomitted some of the laboratories in parts one, two, and three, you likely will have time to continue on to partfour, Plant Growth Relationships. The same will be true if your school schedules a double period advancedplacement class, or a larger block of laboratory hours.You also could study part four after part two, Diversity of Life and Reproduction, for the sake of continuity,or you may wish to study it at the end of the school year, if the climate in your locality favors such an approach.Plant Growth RelationshipsPart four, Plant Growth Relationships, contains laboratories which are experimental in design and comprisedof both classic experiments in the field, such as Darwin's phototropism experiment, and relatively new experi-ments, such as those involving autoradiography. Part four introduces students to new biological techniques vii and equipment, such as the proper use of radioactive substances in plant physiology studies. If time does notpermit complete coverage of this part, a reading of discussion sections would still be useful.Student GroupsMaterials and equipment lists provided with each laboratory are for a student group of two individuals.The teacher accordingly will have to multiply supply requirements by the number of student groups in eachclass. It is extremely important that every student receive hands-on experience during the laboratories. Theshy or reluct ?.It student, or even the most outgoing, learns far less in a large group laboratory arrangement.Laboratory PreparationAll instructions for laboratory set-up are included in this manual. There is no separate teacher's guide. Yourstudents, who may well pursue medical or scientific careers, should learn what is involved in the organizationand preparation of laboratories, and aid in their set-up, if at all possible. Instructors will need to practice thorough,advanced planning, in order to stock all necessary supplies. This planning is best accomplished the previousspring. Appendix B at the end of the manual lists those suppliers with which the author is familiar.The LaboratoryInAction Biology. Advanced Placement for the Second Year, procedural steps are detailed and space isinterspersed for students to enter data, observations, and conclusions. Responsible students can conduct thelaboratories without direct instructor supervision, once all materials and supplies are made available. In fact,some of the descriptive laboratories are self-programmed in their approach.TestingStudent data, observations, and conclusions can be checked through periodic collection of manuals. Thereviews placed on tear-out sheets at the end of each discussion and laboratory can be used either as a studentself-testing and review device, or as a formal quiz. If the latter option is selected, the quiz may be removedin advance. An answer key to both laboratory questions and unit reviews for the entire manual is suppliedas Appendix C on tear-out sheets.'Instructors may either leave these sheets in the manual, for students toperform their own diagnostics, or tear them out prior to the beginning of the school year.Further ResearchSuggestions are offered throughout the text regarding further research possibilities. Selected additional readingresources are listed at the conclusion of each unit. These are highly selective, with an eye to availability ofthe material in a typical community, as well as to its comprehensibility by the students. These resources serveas a starting point for more in-depth research. Instructors should consider having students perform a majorresearch project during the year, providing them with the resources, materials, community contact. and othergeneral support required. The student should have intellectually matured to the point that a formal researchreport would be meaningful.These laboratories and discussions are offered with the hope that they prove as useful to your biology programas they have been to mine. If you have any suggestions, please let me know care of the publisher.Mary Pitt Davis Action BiologyAdvanced Placement for the Second Year Table of ContentsPagePrefaceNote to Users viTable of Contents ixPart One: Instrumentation in the Study of the Cell Discussion1.Development of Coacervates 1Objectives of this discussion ...Questions about living matter ...Oparin theory ...

DiscussionDevelopment of Coacervates When you have completed this discussion you should be able to:1.Explain the Oparin theory of spontaneous generation anddefine coacervates.2.Outline Stanley Miller's experiments creating amino acidsfrom gases.3.Detail Sidney Fox's experiments with amino acid chainsand define microspheres.4.Discuss the scientific issues surrounding abiotic origins. Questions about Living MatterWhat distinguishes living from nonliving matter? What is an organism as contrasted to an aggregation oforganic molcules? Some aggregates can accumulate substances from their surroundings, catalyze them internallyfor energy, and then duplicate themselves. To be able both to metabolize and to reproduce defines the living.But whence came this capability? And how did living organisms, the first organisms, arise?It is known that humans give birth to humans, frogs produce frogs, and wheat yields wheat. This is thecommonsensical principle of biogenesis, or life from life. Louis Pasteur of France provided a series of classicexperiments in 1862 which demonstrated that life cannot appear spontaneously from nonliving materials. suchas frogs from mud, or maggots from meat. Life yields life. And yet, from where, came the first life which producedall later generations?Oparin TheoryA modern theory of spontaneous generation was advanced in 1924 by the Russian biochemist, A. I. Oparin.It was not until 1936, with the publication and translation into English of Oparin's new book, The Origin ofLife on Earth, that his ideas began to impact upon the world's scientific community. Many could not acceptthe Russian's hypotheses, but his concepts could not be dismissed out of hand. Years later Oparin was awardedthe Nobel Prize for his theories on the chemical conditions' which might have yielded the first living organisms.Oparin's work has spawned a continuing series of experiments about the origin of life on earth.Oparin hypothesized a series of chemical reactions leading to the first metabolizing and reproducing organisms.The first step would be the formation of small organic molecules, such as amino acids, organic bases, andmonosaccharides. Next would be the formation of structural polymers, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.from the small organic molecules. The final step would he the integration of the intermediate structural polymersinto organisms.Oparin suggested that the atmosphere of the early earth contained those elements and molecules whichcould combine to form the first building blocks of life. These would have included hydrogen, methane. ammonia,water, etc. The question then arose as to how thermodynamically stable compounds could react to form simpleamino acids, organic bases, and monosaccharides. Some external source of energy would have had toact upon the mixture. Possibilities included solar radiation, lightning, vulcanism, radioactive decay. andcosmic rays. 17 Miller ExperimentA young graduate student working at the University of Chicago, Stanley Miller, conducted a series ofexperiments in 1953 which demonstrated that the building blocks of life could be synthesized abiotically. Nowteaching at the University of California, Berke It..y, Miller received the Nobel Prize in 1958.Miller set up an airtight apparatus in which four gases, hydrogen (1-12). ammonia (NH3). methane (CH,),and water vapor (I-120), were circulated past electrical discharges from tungsten electrodes. He kept the gasescirculating continuously for one week and then analyzed the contents of the apparatus. He found that a largevariety of organic compounds had been synthesized, including those essential for living systems.This experiment by Miller, which provided the first solid el.dence that Oparin might have been on theright '..ack, marked a turning point in the scientific approach to ti e question of how life began. To verify theexperiment. Miller repeated it several times, as well as altering key variables in the original experiment. Hecirculated the four gases for a week without any energy input, and no organic molecules were formed. Hesterilized the apparatus at 130\u00b0C for 18 hours to ensure the absence of any living organism which couldcontaminate the results: this experiment yielded the same results as the original experiment. The synthesisof organic molecules had been achieved in the absence of any living organism, a synthesis of the biotic fromthe abiotic. Miller also varied the energy source by using ultraviolet radiation; the experiment still worked. Precursororganic compounds had been formed by supplying energy to a primordial soup of gases.!n the years since 1953 scientists have extended Miller's results by synthesizing a great number of organiccompounds through reducing mixtures of gases in which the initial carbon source has been methane. Mostof the organic molecules thus formed are perishable, because they react slowly with molecular oxygen. Theyalso are broken dowi-i by organisms of decay. However, the prebiotic atmosphere of early earth contained littlefree oxygen. and it certainly contained no living organisms. Theoretically, then, precursor molecules were ableto accumulate in both the atmosphere and in the primordial waters in which they were deposited over an extendedperiod. Large accumulations are not possible today. because of atmospheric oxygen and decay organisms.even though scientists continue to detect organic molecules after thunderstorms and volcanic eruptions, andupon the surface of dust particles high in the atmosphere.Polymer FormationIt has been suggested that while early organic compounds were dispersed on dust particles in our turbulent.primitive atmosphere. thereby displaying a large, reactive surface area, the chemical reactions giving rise tothe first intermediate sized molecules took place. The ancient oceans of the world, or, as George Wald of HarvardUniversity put it. \"the primitive soup: was another possible reducing area for the production of beginning andintermediate sized organic molecules. Even though each such polymerization reaction, in the absence of anappropriate enzyme, is a remote statistical possibility, on a monumental time scale enough unlikely events mighthave occurred to produce the necessary polymers which precede life. George Wald has said, \"given so muchtime, the 'impossible becomes possible, the possible probable, and .the probable virtually certain'Fox ExperimentCertain concentration mechanisms, which could have facilitated the polymerization of organic molecules,might have been provided by the emergence of land. Sidney W. Fox of the University of Miami demonstratedthat if a nearly dry mixture of amino acids is heated. polypeptide molecules, or amino acid chains, are synthesized.especially if phosphates are present. This situation could have appeared in such natural situations as theevaporative shrinking of lagoons, ponds. or puddles in which amino acidS had been deposited. The sun wouldhave both concentrated the acids and provided the energy required for polymerization reactions. The adsorptionof amino acid compounds on surfaces such as clay particles might also have provided the large surface areaneeded for such reactions to proceed.It is worth noting that in both the Fox and Miller experiments polymers were often obtained first. and aminoacids only later, after hydrolysis of the polymers. These experiments suggest that abiotic syntheses may differfundamentally from biochemical syntheses, in that polymers may be formed first, rather than the predictedamino acids. If correct, these findings would significantly shorten the sequ,.nce theorivd by Oparin. 218 CoacervatesThe final step in the Oparin sequence would be the integration of the polymers into organisms. Of course,this final step is a quantum leap which would have to result in an organic aggregate that could both metabolizeand reproduce. The integration would have to be orderly, so that the organism could acquire and use energyin a systematic fashion. Such an integration would result in an endergonic, or energy using system: It wouldhave to be able to accumulate substances from its surroundings and catalyze them in chemical reactions. Phraseddifferently, it would have to be able to metabolize. And it would have to be able to duplicate itself over thegenerations.What mechanism might have yielded this final leap into life? One possibility, and the mechanism demonstratedby Oparin, is a large cluster of organic compounds surrounded by a water membrane which he called coacervates.He was able to form coacervates from polymer solutions under appropriate conditions of temperature, ioniccomposition, and pH. Each such coacervate is a cluster of macromolecules surrounded by a shell of waterin which the individual water molecules are rigidly oriented relative to the colloidal particles within. There isa definite demarcation between the coacervate droplet and the liquid in which it floats. The water shell functionsas a membrane around the droplet.Coacervate droplets have a marked tendency to adsorb and incorporate various substances from thesurrounding solution, sometimes to the point of removing substances from the medium. Coacervate dropletsalso often form definite internal structures, the molecules within the coacervate becoming arranged in an orderlymanner. As more and more materials are incorporated into the droplet, a membrane consisting of surface activesubstances may form just inside the water shell. Thus, the permeability of the boundary of the coacervate becomeseven more selective than before. Scientists have sometimes mistaken them for bacteria and tried to classifythem! They do exhibit many of the properties of living organisms.MicrospheresA different mechanism has been suggested by Stanley Fox. He believes that coacervate droplets formedin a special way may have been the true precursors of living things. He demonstrated that droplets which formspontaneously when hot aqueous solutions of polypeptides are cooled e thibit more of the characteristics ofliving things. Fox called these droplets proteinoid microspheres, rather than coacervate droplets. The microspheresformed in this manner exhibit many of the properties of living cells, such as reacting to the tonicity of the solutionthey are placed in (shrinking in a hypertonic solution and swelling in a hypotonic one), forming a double layeredouter boundary, and having an internal movement similar to cytoplasmic streaming. Microspheres can movein a pattern, contain ATP. grow in size, increase in complexity. bud in a manner similar to yeasts. and aggregatein c', -ters in a pattern resembling many types of bacteria.Naked Gene TheoryA different theory about the final, integrative phase of the emergence of living organisms is called the \"nakedgene\" theory. Some think it likely that life could have evolved merely from self replicating amino acids, or \"nakedgenes\". These \"naked genes\" would develop only the most cursory of protective membranes when conditionsbecame unfavorable to their metabolic and reproductive activities. Thus it is with viruses, simple creatures withsimple DNA or RNA cores and simple protein coats.Remaining QuestionsEach of the above theories, or variants on them, are subject to serious questions and require much additionalwork. For instance. Oparin's coacervate droplets tend to disintegrate with changes of temperature and otherconditions in the solution holding the droplets. Fox's microspheres. although maintained in the laboratory, havenot been demonstrated to be viable outside a controlled environment. However, evidence from outside theselaboratory experiments suggests that they point in the right direction. 3I 0 The most universal metabolic processes, the ones which are probably the most ancient, are similar to themeans whereby Oparin's coacervate droplets and Fox's microspheres maintain themselves. For instance, cellularrespiration, or a close analog, was seen in the first prebiotic systems. They used ATP as an immediate sourceof energy. This is a heterotrophic mechanism, which is the metabolic process most likely to have been usedby the first organisms. And it is the metabolic process of coacervates and microspheres.Assuming that Oparin's coacervate droplets point toward an explanation of the origin of life, many furtherquestions must be answered. For example, how did autotrophs develop from heterotrophs? Which came first,DNA or RNA? At what point in time did aerobic respiration evolve over fermentation? How did the use ofwater as a H + donor appear? How did cellular organelles develop? Are mitochondria and chloroplasts reallysymbiotic bacteria and algae? How did sexual reproduction develop in eukaryotes, making more genetic variationpossible? Many additional questions about the origin of life remain. The door is wide open to the curious andcreative student.Coacervate DemonstrationsSome properties of coacervates may beexplored by the following.Coacervates: Imitation of Movement Mechanism.An overhead projector easily shows this demonstration to an entire class. Place the lid of a glass petri dishon an overhead projector and turn it on. Place a small amount of mercury on the lid, and then place twoor three drops of potassium dichromate and two or three drops of dilute nitric acid on the lid. When the mercurycomes in contact with the potassium dichromate and dilute nitric acid, the mercury will imitate amoebic move-ment, much as coacervate droplets achieve.Miller's Spark Discharge ApparatusStudents may wish to duplicate Stanley Miller's apparatus for the creation of amino acids: vacuumgases:H2OCH4NH3 11 Figure 1 40sparkdischarge condenser The apparatus can be set up and allowed to run continuously for several weeks.

DiscussionChromatography When you have completed this discussion you should be able to:1.List chromatographic types, techniques, and procedures.2.Discuss research applications of chromatographic methods. BackgroundIn 1903 Mikhail Tswett. a Russian botanist, reported using a new technique for separating pigments intotheir component parts. He placed a solution of leaf pigments on top of a colum.n of calcium carbonate particlesand passed pure solvent down the column. The component parts of the leaf pigments were \"developed\" asthe solvent separated them, and they were adsorbed onto the calcium carbonate particles at different levelsin the column. Since these materials were colored, Tswett named this new separation process \"chromatography.\"The chromatographic technique today is used to separate colorless materials as well. Therefore, the bestdefinition of chromatography is that it is a technique to separate compounds by the percolation of fluid througha body of porous. rigid material. It does not matter what the physical-chemical processes are that yield theseparation. They are all considered to be chromatographic processes.ApplicationsPractically all disciplines of science use chromatography. It has contributed much of our knowledge ofthe lanthanide and actinide elements in the periodic table of elements. It has contributed to the bulk of ourknowledge of amino acids, nucleotides. and nucleoproteins. It is widely used for the microanalysis of fissionproducts in atomic reactors. It is used for the detection of additives in foods, drugs, dyes, pesticides, perfumes,vitamins, antibiotics, and hormones. It is important in medicine for the detection of normal and abnormalconstituents of blood. urine, saliva, and body tissues. It has helped scientists to trace metabolic pathways inthe body and to understand various genetic defects.TechniqueIn chromatography the substances to be separated are dissolved in a liquid (if it is a liquid) or evaporatedin a gas (if it is a gas). This fluid enters the \"moving phase\" of the system in which it is passed through theinterstices of a porous material. The absorbing or adsorbing material may be a finely divided solid. gel, orliquid. Separation occurs when the substances to be separated react differently over time with the solvent andthe collection material. Once the solvent has passed through an apparatus, and the constituent compoundsof the original complex material have differentially separated, they are in the \"stationary phase\" and analysisof the different compounds can begin.Liquid Chromatography: a procedure in which solvent and solute are liquid. Column ChromatographyIt was the method used by Mikhail Tswett to separate leaf pigments. Columns are filled with particulatematter and the substance to he analyzed is dissolved in a solvent and placed at the top of the column. Puresolvent is poured over the substance and the entire solution then passes down the column. This is called elution. 11 When. two or more solvents are used, the procedure is called gradient elution. A column procedure mightproceed as follows: substancexxuyzzsolvent xx s..z.0z Figure 1z'' effluent Remember that chromatography is merely a mechanical separation process. Analysis of the yield requiresother procedures and instruments, such as measurement of optical activity ..vith the photometer or light refrac-tability with the spectrophotometer.ApplicationsThe most common type of chromatography used in protein analysis is column chromatography. The firstprotein structure ever to be completely analyzed was insulin. In 1953 Frederick Sanger of Cambridge Universityin England determined amino acid sequences in polypeptide chains of insulin by column chromatography.He used a large glass tube filled with plastic resin beads that were electrically charged. He poured insulin downthe tube, and the various amino acids in the sample moved down the column at different rates, dependingon their size and electrical attraction. He then washed the column with a solvent, and those amino acids whichtravelled fastest got washed out. or eluted, first. Sanger changed the vessels collecting the effluent frequently,so that fractions of the effluent were collected in sequence. Each vessel then contained only one, or a veryfew types of molecules, from the original insulin. This is called the fractionation of insulin. From these samplesSanger could determine the types of amino acids composing insulin. Through analysis of the terminal endingsof the amino acids collected, and by further use of column chromatography techniques, Sanger also deter-mined the sequence in which amino acids are positioned on the insulin protein molecule.The subsequent discovery of bacterial restriction enzymes, which snip DNA selectively at points surroundedby certain patterns of nucleotides. permitted extension of the Sanger technique. Using the procedures and logicdeveloped for his insulin experiments in conjunction with restriction enzyme techniques, Sanger in 1977 analyzedthe entire genetic material of bacteriophage 0X174. Many DNA sequences have now been analyzed. and thisprocedure has provided much of the current information available on gene structure.Paper ChromatographyThe stationary material is a sheet of absorbing paper. in paper chromatography a piece of paper is spottedwith the substance to be analyzed at a given distance from the bottom of the paper. This is called the baseline. The paper is then hung in a chamber or jar, and the very bottom of the paper is placed in contact with 12 a solvent. Slowly the solvent climbs the paper in a candlewicking effect, taking the substance to be analyzedand separating it into its various components by depositing them at different heights up the paper. If the solventonly ascends the paper, it is called one dimensional chromatography. The apparatus might look like this: filter paperstripsolvent front Figure 2substance spotsolvent If the solvent is able to both ascend and descend the paper strip, it is called two dimensional chromato-graphy. For compounds that are difficult to separate. a mixture may be separated first with one solvent, then.after the paper has been dried and rotated 90\u00b0. with a different solvent. This technique allows for more completeseparation of substances with similar properties. The process might go like this: dry and rotatepaper 90\u00b0:::::\":. 1.117:7i.7-1'first solvent \\ original startingpoint spot of samplemixtureFigure 3ApplicationsMelvin Calvin utilized the process of two dimensional chromatography shortly after WWII at the Universityof California, Berkeley. where he and other scientists were studying the biochemical steps intervening betweenthe uptake of CO, and the appearance of the first complex carbohydrates in the chloroplast during photosynthesis.Calvin's solution to the problem. known today as the Calvin-Benson cycle. or the dark reactions of photosynthesis.was possible because of the development of three experimental techniques which he could use to track thecarbon atom during photosynthesis.The first technique, used to track the carbon atom of CO, as it becomes incorporated into other compounds.was developed as a byproduct of the project to build the first atomic bomb. The radioactive carbon isotope\"C was made available to scientists, and it was then possible to prepare samples of CO, in which some ofthe carbon atoms were '4C instead of the stable isotope 12C usually found in nature. Any compound producedby metabolism of the radioactive material would also be radioactive. 132 The second technique, two dimensional paper chromatography. was an improved method for separatingmixtures of different substances into their individual parts. It was a simple and yet effective method for achiev-ing separation of the sample mixtures with which Calvin was working.The third technique. called autoradiography, was developed to locate tiny amounts of radioactive materialon two dimensional paper chromatograms (the sheets on which chromatography has been performed). Thechromatogram. which has spots of '4C on it, is taken into a darkroom and covered either with a type of photo-graphic film, or with a liquid photographic emulsion. This is kept in the dark for a period of time, during whichradioactive decay of '4C results in the release of particles that expose the film. The exposed sections of filmlie directly on the chromatogram where there were accumulations of '4C containing materials. and movementof those materials can be measured. There will be an opportunity to practice autoradiographic techniques ina mineral absorption laboratory later in this manual.Thin Layer ChromatographyIt is similar to paper chromatography. except for the use of a glass plate coated with an adsorbant in theform of a loose powder or slurry. The next laboratory in this manual utilizes this process.Ion Exchange ChromatographyIt can be used in conjunction with any of the above procedures. The key difference is that ion exchangeresins are installed as particles in a column, on paper, or formed as thin film on plates.Gas Chromatography: a procedure used to analyze gases.Gas-liquid ChromatographyThe gas being analyzed adheres to a liquid film. The stationary material is a liquid spread over an inertbase with a high specific surface tension, such as small diameter tubes like capillary pipets.Gas-solid ChromatographyIt is similar to gas-liquid chromatography, except that the gas is passed over a solid surface instead of aliquid one.There exist sophisticated variations on all of the above procedures. because the chromatographic separa-tion process has proven to be so useful. In the next laboratory we will employ one of the procedures, thinlayer chromatography. to separate and identify amino acids.ResourcesClark, B. F. and K. A.

LaboratoryAmino Acid Chromatography When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Describe the techniques of thin layer chromatography.2.Determine the Rf standards for known amino acids.3.Use the chromatographic technique to identify unknownamino acids. PurposeChroMatography takes the studem: into a phase of science where execution is critical. Special instrumentsand advanced techniques now occupy the center of many life science laboratories. For example. the proceduresof chromatography are not difficult to comprehend, and the chromatographic technique only yields separatedcompounds which must be studied by still other means. However, without careful and precise execution ofchromatographic separation, further analysis would yield invalid results. Carelessness with the procedure canclose potentially promising avenues of research. In coming weeks we will perform still other procedures, suchas spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis. where the watch words will have to be clean and careful.Chromatography ProcessChromatography is an efficient tool for separating and identifying amino acids. The separation processbegins by applying a tiny spot of amino acid to the base line of a matrix. In this laboratory, Ire matrix cons;stsof silica gel slurry dried on a glass plate. The spotted plate is inserted vertically in a Cop lin jar, and the solventin the bottom is at:is:II-bed by the matrix in a cat.dieicI.oa effect. As it moves upward. the solvent dissolvesthe substances in the mixture and allows them io miqract. eking the matrix. Different am;oo kids will migratedifferent distances. For normally colorless amino ac'd., to oe detectable through a chromatographic technique,separated compounds must be sprayed ninhydri;. v causes an oxidation reduct'o. reaction leadingto coloration.The solvent in the bottom of the Coplin jar is carefully formulated so that the amino ac'ds are not completelys_!uble in it. or they would move as fast as the solvent itself. At the sane time, the substances must not becompletely insoluble in the solvent, or they would net move up the plate at al;. When the observer stops theprocedure before the solvent reaches the top of the plate. the exac' positior of the so' ..ent front (she leadingedge of the area wet by the solvent) is noted. When the observer dries the finished chi-. ,matograrn and spraysit with ninhydrin, the distance moved by each ammo acid can be measured.Retardation FactorThe distance moved by each amino aci _1is compared with the distance traveled b./ the solvent itself. Theratio of the two is theRf.or retardation factor. The RI expresses the ratio of the rate of movement of themigrating substance to the rate of flow of solvent within the system. In erwords, the Fif describes the ratiof distances travelled The RI\" is always constant fur a given substance in a par.ic solvent system.RI = distance traveled by substance (mm)distance tr,-,veied by solvent (mm.)The purpose of this laboratory is to determine the characteristic RI values of some known amino acids,and also to separate and identify unknown mixtures of amino acids using chromatographic techniques. Throughchromatographing the unknown mixtures of amino acids and calculating their Rf values, a student shouldbe able to identify the acids by comparison with standard Rf s. Pre-labSupplies needed for amino acid chromatography:EquipmentCop lin jarcapillary pipets, 10 ml.fume hood (or other separate area)Materialsamino add standards. 20amino acid unknowns (3 unlabelledamino sheetspencil chromatography solventninhydrin spraypetroleum jellySome of these materials have to be made in advance, and some can only ko ordered from a limited numberof suppliers.Special Preparations1) Amino acid standards kits: it is best to store the amino acid solutions in small vials which will preservethem for several years. Standard solutions usually contain 0.2% of each amine acid in 10% propanol. Whenpreparing for use, dissolve 20 mg. of each amino acid solution in 9 ml. distilled water and 1 ml. propanol.2) The teacher will select the unknowns and make mixtures from the stock of standards.

Keep tightly covered and provide fresh solvent for each laboratory.4) To uFe :Aerosol ninhydrin spray. set up a spray area in a fume hood, in a large cardboard box. or outsideto keep the fumes out of the general laboratory area.Time Required:The amino acid chromatography laboratory requires three classroom hours, in addition to preparations,discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1`.udents need the following: pencils, chromatography sheets, amino acid standards, unknown aminoacids, and capillary pipets.StepsA.Place a chromatugraphy sheet flat on a table, silica gel side up. Touch it as little as possible to preventcontamination by skin oils. Measure 1 cm. up each short side with a pencil. Make a small dot on each sideand join them with a straight light pencil line across the face of the sheet. The long edge of the sheet containingthe line will now b\u00b0 known as the origin, and the line known as the base line.B. Carefully spot the amino acid standards and unknowns along the base line. Spot them no closer than2 cm. apart. Otherwise. they tend to bleed into each other. Each plate will take five spots. This is how it is done: 1)use a separate capillary pipet for each arnino acid solution and unknown;2) touch the gel very quickly with only the end of the pipet so that the spot will be the smallest possible:3)let the spots \"air dry thoroughly: 18 4) while the first chromatography sheet is drying. make the others required (each student or laboratorygroup should use five chromatography sheets in order to spot all 25 of the amino acids and unknowns):5)label the sheets sequentially with pencil on the very top right hand side of each sheet;6) when the first spots dry. apply a second spot in the exact same place. and of the exact same aminoacid or unknown (this intensifies the amino acid concentration in a small area); and,7) allow these second spots to dry thoroughly.C. Record the name of the amino acid or the number of the unknown below eac:i of the spots indicatedon the following chromatography sheet diagrams: 1. Figure 1 Figure 2 1934 Figure 3 Figure 4 2035 Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following: spotted and dried chromatography sheets, Cop lin jar and lid, solvent, andpetroleum jelly.It is now time to chromatograph.StepsA. Very carefully set the chromatographic sheets inside a Cop lin jar containing solvent. The solvent levelshould be low enough so that the base line and spots are above, not in, the solvent. Do not allow the sheetsto touch each other in the jar.B. Place the lid on the Cop lin jar after first placing a heavy layer of petroleum jelly around the lip of thejar. This helps seal the solvent fumes inside the jar.C. Let the solvent move up the gel until it is within 1 cm. of the top. This can take anywhere from 30minutes to two hours. depending upon the environment (temperature, air pressure. and humidity all affectchromatographic adsorption). Students will have to make arrangements to complete this phase of the labora-tory outside of class if the process takes longer than a class hour.D. When the solvent is 1 cm. from the top of the sheets, stop the experiment by removing the sheets fromthe Cop lin jar. Immediately lightly pencil or scratch an area on each side of the sheet above each spot to showthe position reached by the solvent front.E. Air dry the sheets overnight. Allow nothing to touch them while they are drying.Procedure: Hour 3Students need the following: prepared chromatography sheets, ninhydrin spray. and a fume hood (ora temporary fume hood constructed of a cardboard box. or an outdoor area in which to spray the ninhydrin).Be extremely careful when using ninhydrn. It is toxic. Do not breathe it or get it on your skin. If youare accidentally contaminated with ninhydrin, wash the area thoroughly with lots of water.StepsA. Carefully prop the chromatography sheets under the fume hood, or in a safe outside area, and spraythem with ninhydrin. Ninhydrin reacts with amino acid spots to produce identifiable visible spots.B. For each spot, record the color in the chart on page 22. The amino acids having primary a-aminogroups yield pink to purple spots: the secondary amines such as proline and hydroxyproline yield yellow spots.Recording the color of the ninhydrin sprayed amino acid gives the student a crude check on Rf calculationsused to identify unknowns.C. Measure the distance the spot traveled. The precise distance is the distance from the center of the originalspot, at the origin, to the center of the colored spot. Rf generally decrL.:i.es with increasing molecular weight.However. in the series glycine, alanine, valine, and leucine. the larger the alkyl group, the more the acid tendsto move along with the organic solvent, because of its increased solubility.D. Also measure the exact distance traveled by the solvent in each case (solvent movement can be irregularacross the face of an entire plate: correct results require solvent front measurements immediately above each spot). 2136 distance moved by solvent distance movedby slow spot-\"..\".:.:..f.i.'65...i,4!

DiscussionPolarimetry When you have completed this discussion you should be able to: 1.Describe polarized light.2.Sketch and describe the function of a polarimeter.3.Define optical activity and provide examples. Scientists discovered early in the nineteenth century that solutions of sugar and certain other naturallyoccurring chemicals rotate a beam of polarized light passing through the solution. They called such substancesoptically active. a term still in use. The instrument used to demonstrate or to measure this rotation was giventhe name polarimeter.Optical activity is best understood by knowing how a polarimeter works. And to understand a polarimeter.one must know about the polarization of light. When these are comprehended. the optical activities of someorganic compounds can be studied.Polarized LightPhysicists describe visible light as a form of electromagnetic radiation. There are many kinds of electromagneticradiation. such as X-rays. ultraviolet light, and radio waves. All these forms of energy travel in the form ofwaves in which a matched pair of electric and magnetic fields move up and down as the wave moves forward.This movement is at the speed of light and is conveniently depicted by a sine wave such as the following. Pattern of anelectromagnetic wave Figure1Direction oflight beam A beam of light consists of an infinite number of such light waves moving in every possible direction. Ifone were to look at a beam of light directly. the light beams would scatter in all directions from the originalsource of light. This is called nonpolarized light. In a single flat plane. it would look something like this: A1-------__ _Figure 2 271 1Scattering of anonpolarizedlight beam This property of light can be altered. A light beam can be reflected off a sheet of glass in such a way thatit is plane-polarized, that is, the waves are made to move parallel to each other. Schematically, light wavesmoving all in the same direction might look something like this: Figure 3Polarized light There is another way to polarize a beam of light. Certain crystals can convert nonpolarized light into plane-polarized light. Crystals of the mineral calcite are structured in such a way that they naturally polarize light.The material known as polaroid is an artificial substance that does the same thing.The PolarimeterThe polarimeter is a simple device designed to study compounds that affect the polarization of light. Thisis how a polarimeter is designed: it13.:X.:*:4440.:-'40.. lightpolarizingprismsample source is at a polarizing prism, which is made of calcite. polaroid. or any other polarizingmaterial. The light is polarized in the prism and leaves the prism plane-polarized. The light then enters thesample tube which contains a liquid sample. If the tube is filled with nothing but distilled water, the plane-polarized light will pass through without a change of direction. If the analyzing prism, which is also polarized.is lined up at the same angle as the polarizing prism, all of the polarized light rays will pass through. However,if the sample changes the direction of the light passing through the tube, fewer light rays emerge from theanalyzing prism. A difference of ninety degrees between the direction of the polarized light and the analyzingprism yields darkness.000.,01.1,1 180\u00b0270\u00b00\u00b0:::1K40 90\u00b0analyzingprismobserver The observer turns the analyzing prism slowly until the maximum amount of light shines through the analyzingprism. Since the analyzing prism is graduated, the observer can read the angle of rotation. Both the extentand direction of rotation can be read. The result usually is recorded as plus (+) or minus ( ) the angle ofrotation. A solution which rotates light 20\u00b0 to the left would be recorded as 20\u00b0 and would be called levorotatory.since the prefix levo means \"left\" in Latin. Solutions which rotate- light to the right ar..2 called dextrorotatory. 28 BackgroundPolarimeters traditionally were built around carefully cut prisms formed from Iceland Spar (calcite). Suchprisms, known as Nicol prisms. were often found in advanced chemistry courses and were used only by facultyand a few graduate students. They were too expensive and delicate for general use. For many years, develop-mental work on polarimeters was focused on making instruments that were more and more precise. The 360\u00b0measuring scales can be equipped with special eyepieces and verniers that can be read to the nearest 0.01\u00b0The sample tubes also underwent a similar development so that the length of tube through which the polarizedlight passes can be read to the nearest 0.01 mm.Expensive and complicated polarimeters are used when high degrees of accuracy are required. There aremany situations in which a general result obtained with a simplified polarimeter would be sufficient. Someof these applications are industrial, others are academic. For example, a simple polarimeter is all that is re-quired to make quick checks of whether organic compounds ranging from carbohydrates to amino acids areoptically active. This need was met by development of low cost polarimeters.A number of engineering changes were incorporated into these new generation polarimeters. For instance.measurements are made at the point of optical extinction rather than the point of maximum brightness. Somesmall degree of accuracy was sacrificed so that eye strain associated with maximum brightness can be eased.Also. these polarimeters use a polaroid sheet instead of expensive crystal prisms.Optical ActivityMolecules which rotate a beam of polarized light are described as being optically active. Chemists wantedto know if an optically active molecule has a typical molecular structure, and, if the molecular structure is known.if its optical activity can be predicted. In 1874, two chemists, the Frenchman Le Bel and the Dutchman van tHoff. independently solved the problem. They noted that the four valence elecrons in a carbon atom are nor-mally directed at the four corners of a tetrahedran. If one were to construct a tetrahedral carbon atom withfour different substituents at the four corners. it is possible to make two different models of the figure. It waslearned that a molecule is optically inactive if its mirror image is superimposable. On the other hand, a moleculeis optically active if its mirror image is not superimposable.A simple example of mirror images which are not-superimposable is human hands. They are mirror imagesof one another, but with both palms facing up. they do not fit one upon the other. It is still not understoodwhy molecules which are mirror images but not superimposable are optically active.EnantiomersTwo moleOules which are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are called enantiomers. Sinceenantiomers are exactly identical in their chemical properties. usual chemical reactions yield as many moleculesof one type of enantiomer as another. This 50-50 mixture of two optically active forms of the. same moleculeis called a racemic mixture. In racemic mixtures there is no optical activity, since one half of the moleculesrotate light to the left and one half rotate light to the right. The sum total of light rotation is zero.Louis Pasteur. the ''Father of Microbiology\", discovered that an enantiomer sometimes crystallizes in a slightlydifferent form from its mirror image. He used a magnifying glass to painstakingly pick out one enantiomerfrom the other. Unfortunately, only a few optical isomers show a difference in crystalline structure. and thismethod is not used today. Some chemical reactions can be designed to yield specific enantiomers. The largestsource of enantiomers is microorganisms which produce enantiomers as metabolic byproducts. Scientists letthese microorganisms do the work for them, although they do not yet fully understand why microorganismsproduce specific enantiomers.Excepting their structure. enantiomers have the same physical and chemical properties. There are onlytwo ways 'in which they differ one from the other, other than their form. They rotate the plane of polarizedlight, and they are used differently by living organisms. For example, dextrorotatory glucose (D-glucose) is 29.13 extremely important in human metabolism. It is formed during the metabolism of starch and sucrose and isbroken down by our bodies to produce carbon dioxide. water, and energy. Levorotatory glucose (L-glucose)cannot be used by the human body at all, even though it has the same sweet taste. We would starve to deathon a diet which contained L-glucose as the source of energy.DiasteriomersSometimes a molecule is not composed in merely two enantiomeric forms, but three, or even more. Theyare said to be compounds with more than one asymmetric carbon atom. An example of this H and second isomers are mirror images of each other and are enantiomers. The first and secondisomers are not mirror images of the third isomer, and so they are termed cliasteriomers of each other. Thethird isomer has its mirror image too: MOHHOCHHOCH COONmirrorTartaric acid has a special property known as internal symmetry. The upperhalves are identical to the lower halves. If a molecule possesses this internalsymmetry. there is only one optically active form of that form of thecompound. That isomer is referred to as the meso form of the compound. Figure 6Polarimeter DemonstrationsThe capabilities of the polarimeter may be demonstrated by any of the following experiments. The instruc-tor may wish to perform these demonstrations and discuss the conclusions drawn from them. Or. studentsmay wish to proceed with them as experiments. submitting their results to the instructor in formal laboratory reports.Qualitative Polarimetry:CarbohydratesThe polarimeter easily cl:,monstrates how different carbohydrates rotate polarized light. Many optically activesugars are readily available and relatively low in cost. Examples are D-glucose ond L-glucose. The followingdemonstration can be conducted with standard 35 ml. polarimeter cells, or tubes. Weigh 5 grams of sugar and transfer it to a 25 ml. volumetric flask. Dissolve the sample sugar in waterand dilute it to the 25 ml. calibration mark on the volumetric flask.Pour the solution into the polarimeter tube, dry the outside, and carefully position the tube in the polarimeter.Turn on the polarimeter light and rotate the eyepiece until the light is extinguished. This will happen near the0 degree mark. With some substances having high rotation. some secondary color effects may be noticeable.If this happens, choose the darkest point, the point where there is neither a greenish nor a reddish cast. Makeseveral readings and average results.Remove the polarimeter tube and measure and record, in decimeters, solution height from the inside ofthe base to the bottom of the meniscus. Empty. clean, and dry the cylinder.Calculate the specific rotation as follows, remembering that if the rotation is clockwise, rotation is plus. and icounter clockwise, rotation is minus:specific rotation =observed rotation x ml. of solutionsolution height (dm.) x grams of unknownIf the instructor or students repeat this experiment with different optically active sugars. the specific rota-tions of each sugar can then be compared.Qualitative Polarimetry:Amino AcidsWith the exception of glycine, all amino adds are optically active. However, many exhibit rather low specificrotations, and it is best to demonstrate the polarimeter with those amino acids having large specific rotations.L-cystine is a good amino acid to use, since it is less expensive than some and has a relatively large specificrotation. Dissolve 0.25 grams of L-cystine in 15 ml. of 1 molar hydrochloric acid. and transfer the solutionto a 25 ml. volumetric flask. Add additional acid until the 25 ml. mark is reached.Proceed as per the demonstration on carbohydrates in qualitative polarimetry.Changing the concentration of the hydrochloric acid solvent changes the specific rotation of the aminoacid solute. The instructor may wish to have students experiment with different solvent concentrations.Quantitative PolarimetryThe extent of light rotation is also dependent upon the concentration of the optically active substance. Thepolarimeter can be used to determine the concentration of a solution containing optically active material. Thisis done by making up a series of solutions of different known concentrations of the material, measuring theirobserved rotations, plotting a graph, and determining an unknown concentration by comparing its observedrotation with the graph.Make 25 ml. of solution as per the carbohydrate demonstration on qualitative polarimetry, and measureand record its rotation. The solution is unaffected by use in the polarimeter and can be repeatedly diluted toproduce solutions of new concentration. This procedure is called serial dilution.Take half of the original solution and dilute it with an equal amount of water or solvent. Calculate the newconcentration and measure and record its specific rotation. Continue making such dilutions and measuringtheir rotations until there are at least five readings (for further instruction on serial dilution see Laboratory #9).Plot a graph of observed degrees of rotation against concentration. Measure the rotation of a solution ofunknown concentration, and determine its concentration by reference to the graph.The following inverse proportion can be used to determine the concentration of the diluted solution:concentration of diluted solution = volume of concentrated solutionconcentration of concentrated solution volume of diluted solution 315 Resource3Calvin, M.

DiscussionSpectrophotometry When you have completed this discussion you should be able to:1.Explain the wave model of light.2.Explain the photon model of light.3.Explain how living things depend on light.4.Explain how a spectrophotometer works. Particle Theory of LightOver 300 years ago, Sir Isaac Newton, the English physicist. separated visible light into a spectrum ofcolors by passing it through a prism. When he passed the spectrum of colors through a second prism whitelight was produced once again. By this experiment. Newton showed that white, or visible light, is actuallymade up -)f a number of different colors. Their separation is possible because light of different colors is bentat different angles when passing through the prism. Newton believed that light consisted of a stream of parti-cles (he termed them \"corpuscles\"). partly because of their tendency to travel in a straight line.Wave Model of LightJames C. Maxwell, in the nineteenth century, demonstrated that what we experience as light is in trutha very small part of a vast, continuous spectrum of radiation, the electromagnetic spectrum. As Maxwell showed.all the radiation included in this spectrum act as if they travel in waves. The wavelengths (the distances fromone wave peak to the next) range from those of gamma rays, which are measured in nanometers, to thoseof low frequency radio waves, which are measured in kilometers. Within the spectrum of visible light, redlight has the longest wavelength and violet the shortest. All these radiations travel 300,000 kilometers persecond (or 186,000 miles per second) in a vacuum. This is the speed of light. The chart below demonstratesthat visible light makes up only a small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum: gamma raysx-raysUVinfraredradio waves wavelength<1 nm100nm<1 m>1000 m visible light blackvioletbluegreenyellowredbrown 380430500560600650750wavelength (nanometers)Figure 1 35 The wave model of light led to predictions that the brighter the light the greater the force with which electronswould be dislodged from metals being struck by light. However, whether or not light can eject the electronsof a particular metal depends not on the brightness of the light but on its wavelength. It had become clearby 1900 that the wave model of fight was not adequate to explain this phenomenon. For example, when azinc plate is exposed to ultraviolet light, it acquires a positive charge. The metal becomes positively chargedwhen light energy dislodges electrons, forcing them out of the metal atoms. This photoelectric effect can beproduced in all metals. Every metal has a critical wavelength for the effect; the light (visible or invisible) mustbe of the correct wavelength. or shorter. for the effect to occur. The critical wavelength of some metals, suchas potassium, selenium, and sodium, is within the spectrum of visible light. Therefore, visible light striking themetal can set up a moving stream of electrons. Such a moving stream of electrons is an electric current. Burglaralarms, exposure meters, television cameras, and electric eye door openers all operate on this principle of turninglight energy into electrical energy.Photon Model of LightTo explain this phenomenon, the particle,model of light. as originally advanced by Sir Isaac Newton. wasresurrected by Albert Einstein in 1905 as the photon model of light. Albert Einstein stated that light is composedof particles of energy which he called photons. The energy of a photon is not the same for all kinds of light.It is inversely proportional to the wavelength. Phrased differently. the longer the wavelength the lower the energy.Therefore. photons of violet light, the shortest visible light wavelength, have almost twice the energy as.photonsof red light. the longest visible wavelength.The wave model of light permits physicists to describe certain aspect of its behavior mathematically. andthe photon model permits another set of mathematical predictions and calculations. The two models of lightare considered today to be complementary light models, each explaining an aspect of light. We still lack anintegrated the(to completely describe the phenomenon called light.Light and Living ThingsTo understand light and its action on living things is a very important aspect of biology. Visible light is respon-sible for photosynthesis (on which all life depends). vision (on which many organisms depend). and the rhythmicday and night aspects of many biological activities. George Wald of Harvard University thinks that if life existselsewhere in the uniuerse, it is probably dependent on the same small fragment of electromagnetic radiation.visible light. Wald bases his conjecture on two points.First. living things are composed of large. complicated molecules held together by energy bonds. Radiationof even slightly higher energies than the energy of violet light, that is, radiation at a frequency just below visiblelight. tends to break these bonds and disrupt the structure and function of the molecules. These lower frequency.higher photon energy level radiations drive electrons out of atoms. On the other hand, higher frequency radiatic. 's beyond visible light, ones with lower photon energy levels than that of red light, are absorbable by water.Since water makes up the great bulk of all living things, radiation higher in frequency than visible red can transferits energy in the form of heat to the water within the living organism. In sufficient doses, at frequencies eitherabove or below visible light. electromagnetic radiations are lethal to life. Only those radiations within the rangeof visible light have the property of exciting molecules (moving electrons into higher energy levels) withoutdestroying them.Second. visible light provides the bulk of electromagnetic radiation available in the biosphere. Much of therest of the spectrum is screened out by the ozone layer, water vapor. and carbon dioxide before it reachesthe earth's surface. Quite simply. the bulk of the energy available at the surface is precisely that which canbe used by living organisms, visible light.ColorsMan's perception of visible light is in the form of full spectrum white light. or as colors. Colors are deter-mined by the reflection of unabsorbed fis..luencies. Thus, a red appearing object is one which absorbs theblue and or green components of visible light A colored object selectively absorbs and reflects particularfrequencies within the visible light spectrum. 36 SpectrophotometryMan's perception of color is only qualitative. It indicates what is happening, but it says nothing about theextent of the event taking place. Spectrophotometry. on the other hand, is the quantitative study of visiblelight. Spectrophotometers are instruments which electronically quantify the amount and kinds of light absorbedby molecules in solution. The instrument does this by measuring the relative amounts of radiant energy asa function of wavelength (frequency).In its simplest form, a spectrophotometer has a source of white light focused on a prism or diffraction gratingwhich separates the white light into disparate bands of radiant energy. Each wavelength (color. or frequency)is then selectively focused through a narrow slit by setting the machine at the appropriate wavelength. Thewidth of this slit is important to the precision of the measurement: the narrower the slit, the more preciselya specific wavelength of light is selected. This single wavelength, called the incident beam (W., passes throughthe sample being measured.The sample. usually dissolved in a suitable solvent. is held in a cuvette. The cuvette is an optically precise.rectangular. glass container standardized to have a light path one centimeter across. After passing through thesample. the selected wavelength of light, now called the transmitted beam (I), strikes a photoelectric tube. Ifthe substance in the cuvette has absorbed any of the incident light, the transmitted light will then be reducedin total energy content. When the transmitted beam strikes the photoelectric tube, it generates an electric currentproportional to the intensity of the light energy striking it. By connecting the photoelectric tube to a devicethat measures electric current (a galvanometer). a means of directly measuring the intensity of the transmittedbeam is achieved. Pc? a = white lightb =redc = greene g d = bluee = exit slitf = refracting prismFigure 2g = = = galvanometer The typical spectrophotometer has a galvanometer with two scales. one indicating the percent transmit N.,tance (\u00b0i-)T. or. the amount of light that has passed through the sample). and the other the absorbance (A.or. the amount of light absorbed by the sample). Absorbance is measured on a logarithmic scale with unequaldivisons graduated from 0.0 to 2.0. Absorbance can also be referred to as optical density (0. D.)Because most organic molecules are dissolved in a solvent before measurement, a source of error arisesin that the solvent itself may absorb light. It is necessary therefore to \"subtract\" the absorbance of the solvent.To achieve this, a \"blank\" (the solvent without the sample to be studied) is first inserted into the instrument.and the scale is set to read 100% transmittance (or 0.0 absorbance) for the solvent. The \"sample \". containingthe solute plus the solvent, is then inserted into the instrument. Any reading on the scale that is less than 100%transmittance (or greater than 0.0 absorbance) is considered to be due to absorbance by the solute only. 37 Spectrophotometers are not limited to detecting only absorption of visible light. Some are adaptable tofunction with a source of ultraviolet light, such as a hydrogen lamp or a mercury lamp, which can providewavelengths that range from 180 to 400 nanometers. These ultraviolet wavelengths are especially useful instudying such molecules as amino acids, proteins, and nucleic acids, because these molecules have charac-teristic aJsorbances in the ultraviolet range. There are even spectrophotometers with sources of infrared radia-tion which provide wavelengths from 780 to 25,000 nanometers. There also are instruments available whichcan continuously give the desired ratio between sample cuvette and blank cuvette, both visually and on a stripchart recorder, although these are not generally found in introductory biology laboratories.The typical spectrophotometer has the following spectrophotometer is an extremely useful instrument with which to study biological molecules andprocesses. For instance, the spectrophotometer was used to analyze the molecular reactions whereby chlo-rophyll converts light energy into chemical energy. and, in the process. it revealed the existence of differentkinds of chlorophyll. Detailed analysis of enzymatically aided reaction sequences within organic compoundsis possible using the spectrophotometer. The instrument also is used to study hormones associated with dayand night rhythms in animals. In two subsequent laboratory activities, enzyme activity and photosynthesis.'the research applications and usefulness of results yielded by the spectrophotometer will be demonstrated.ResourcesBauman.

ExerciseThe Atomic Spectrum of Hydrogen When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Explain the quantum theory.2.Calculate the ten lowest energy levels of hydrogen. PurposeAtoms, depending upon the energy level at which they exist at the moment, will emit specific wavelengthsof light. These emissions, if properly measured and calculated, tell the observer about the energy levels ofthe atoms. These energy levels are called quanta, because they are multiples of discrete energy units, thephotons referred to in discussion five. Energy levels for atoms of every element are predictable, and so anyobserved line in the spectrum of an element is equatable to a particular energy level. The spectrophotometercan accurately measure these light emissions. In this exercise you will calculate hypothetical hydrogen energylevels and then compare these with actua' figures derived from spectrophotometer readings of hydrogen.BackgroundQuantum TheoryThe quantum theory, which states that atoms and molecules can exist only in specific states, each of whichhas a fixed amount of energy, was developed from the particle model of light, first advanced by Sir IsaacNewton and resurrected by Albert Einstein. The particles of light energy. which Einstein called photons, areinversely proportional to the wavelength of light. When an atom or molecule changes its state, it must absorbor emit an amount equal to the difference between the energy of the initial and final states. This energy maybe absorbed or emitted in the form of light and can be represented by the following equation:AE = he where AE is the absolute value of the change in energy in ergs (an erg is a unit of work equal to theforce needed to push a one gram mass one centimeter in one second),hisPlanck's constant (named after Max Planck who first discovered this relationship) which ,is6.6251 x 10-27 erg / second.c is the speed of light. 3.00 x 10\") cm. / second, andX is the wavelength in cm.The change in energy. DE. of the atom or molecule is positive, if light is absorbed. and negative, if itis emitted. Sodium Energy LevelsLet us consider a specific application of the above equation. On the left side of the following chart, thesodium atom is shown to exist at two low energy levels (the right side of the chart will be discussed later).Ground state, for example. occurs at 8.25 x 10-'2 ergs below the energy the atom has when it ionizes, whichis assigned the arbitrary value of zero for all elements. The energy levels, as can be seen, are shown as negative,with the lower energy level having the more negative value. 41.5J Energy levels of sodiumEnergy in ergs tO-4.87 x 10-12 ergs8.25 x 10'2ground stateFigure 141,450 A sodium atom ordinarily exists at its lowest possible energy state, which is termed the ground state. Ifthe atom is excited to its next higher state, it will tend to be unstable and if possible make a transition backdown to its ground state. The energy of the atom will decrease by about 3.38 x 10-12 ergs while making thedownward transition. This amount of energy may be radiated as light, which will have a wavelength represent-ed by the equation, L E = hc. also known as Planck's law. Using Planck's law, the wavelength of light emitted by sodium jumping from the first state back to the groundstate is 5.88 x 10-' cm. Wavelengths of light are normally stated in angstroms (A). Since A equals 1 x 10-8cm.. the sodium light wavelength is 5,880 A. Atomic spectra arise from transitions of this sort, and the associatedwavelengths can be determined just as in the following calculations for sodium.X = hc = 6.625 x 10-21 x 3.00 X x 10-12 = 5.88 x 10-5 cm. = 5.880AWavelength calculations are simplified if energy in the equation .6,E = hc/ X is expressed not in ergs,but in units of ergs/hc. These turn out to have the dimensions of cm-land are called wave numbers, or reciprocalcentimeters Such energy figures are called E'. On the right side of figure one and in the calculations above.the energy levels of the sodium atom are measured in cm -1. The advantage of expressing E' in cm-1 is thatthe equation. written in terms of E'. becomes simply:AE ==1andA =1hcALE'To find the wavelength in reciprocal centimeters for an energy level transition. take the reciprocal of AE'.The calculation of A by this approach is shown above. Notice that it gives the same result as that obtainedby measuring ergs, but the calculations required are easier.Hydrogen Energy LevelsThe simplest atomic spectrum is that of the hydrogen atom. Niels Bohr, in 1913. theoretically explainedatomic spectra with a hydrogen atom model. According to Bohr's theory, the energies E'r, detectable in a hydro.gen atom are all representable by the following equation:E'n = =R where R is a constant predicted by the theory and n is an integer. 1. 2. 3. ...called a quantum number. Allthe lines in the hydrogen atom spectrum are associated with specific energy levels in the atom and are accuratelypredictable by Bohr's equation.The value ofRin the above equation was found to be 109,737.31 cm.-!, one of the most accurate of allphysical constants. On this basis, the above equation takes the form:E' = 109.737.31 cm-'n2642 There are several ways to analyze an atomic spectrum, given the energy levels of the atom. One simplemethod is to calculate wavelengths theoretically using Bohr's equation and then matching these numbers againstthose derived from spectrophotometer readings.ProcedureIn this exercise you will calculate energy levels of hydrogen using Bohr's equation, calculate wavelengthsof hydrogen spectrum lines using reciprocal centimeters. and calculate AE in both reciprocal centimeters andangstroms. You will then compare your calculations against the wavelengths of some lines in the hydrogenatomic spectrum derived from spectrophotometer readings which will be furnished.StepsA. Energy level calculations: given the expression for E 'n in Bohr's equation. it is possible to calculateenergy levels in cm:' for the hydrogen atom. 1.Calculate energy levels in cm:' for each of the ten lowest levels of the hydrogen atom, starting with n = 1as the first quantum number. Remember that the energies are all negative and that the lowest energy levelshould have the largest negative value. Enter these values in the following table. figure two.The ten lowest energy levels of hydrogenquantumnumberenergy E 'n in cm.-'quantumnumberenergy E'nin cm:' Figure 2 2. On the following graph, figure three, plot on the y axis each of the six lowest energies. The y axis of thegraph is to have zero cm-' at the top of the graph and 100,000 cm-' at the bottom. Label the y axis in incrementsof 10,000 cm-l. After spotting the values for the six lowest energies on the y axis, draw a horizontal line ateach energy level and write the energy values on the lines.B. Calculation of wavelengths of hydrogen spectrum lines: hydrogen spectrum lines all arise from jumpsmade by the atom from one energy level to another. The wavelength in centimeters of these lines can be calculatedby applying Planck's law. AE' in the following equation is the difference in energy between any two levels.LE' = En'hiEn'to = 1 cm-',Xwhere En' high (hi) and low (1o) represent different energy states of the atom. Rearranging the equation yieldsX (cm) =1.AE'Solving for angstroms is done as follows: A = X (cm.) x 1 x 10\" 43 Figure 3 44 3.

In the box opposite each wavelength in figure five below, enter quantum numbers for both the upper andlower states whose energy differences yield those wavelengths that can be matched.

PurposeEnzymes are biological catalysts which facilitate the thousands of chemical reactions that occur in livingcells. All living things contain enzymes. They are generally large proteins composed of several hundred aminoacids. In an enzyme catalyzed reaction, the substance to be acted on. or substrate. binds to an active site onthe enzyme. The enzyme and substrate are held together in an enzyme-substrate complex by hydrophobicinteractions, hydrogen bonds. and ionic bonds. The enzyme then converts the substrate to reaction productsin a process that often requires several chemical steps. The products are then released into solution. and theenzyme is free to form another enzyme-substrate complex. Enzymes are used in reactio- s but not used upby them. One enzyme molecule can carry out thousands of reaction cycles every minute.Each enzyme is specific to a certain reaction because it is unique in both its amino acid sequence andits three dimensional structure. The active site also has a specific shape so that only one. or a few. of thethousands of components present in the cell can interact with it. Any substance that blocks or changes thPshape of the active site on an enzyme will interfere with the enzyme's effectiveness. If these changes are largeenough. the enzyme ceases to act and is said to be denatured.The purpose of this laboratory is to analyze the reactions of the enzyme peroxidase under varying physicalconditions. The spectrophotometer will be used to provide data on these reactions.Pre-labMaterials needed for testing the enzymatic activity of peroxidase:Equipmentblender test tube rackbeakers scissorsfunnels marking pencilsspectrophotometer 1 ml. graduated pipetscurettes 10 ml. graduated pipetstest tubes boiling water baths at approximatelytest tube holders 4, 15. 30, and 37\u00b0 C.watch or stopwatch 49 1 Materialsrutabaga, turnip, or radish filter paperguaiacol solution buffer, pH 33% hydrogen peroxide solution buffer. pH 7tissues buffer. pH 1110% hydroxylamine HCltapeparafilmfood coloring Special Preparations1) Test the hydrogen peroxide to assure that it has not degraded.2) For the guaiacol solution, mix 0.22 ml. of guaiacol with 100 ml. distilled water.

Adjust the amount of root and ml. of extract used in the laboratoryas required. Students may wish to perform this part of the pre-lab as a way to familiarize themselves with laboratorymaterials and equipment.a) Peel and cut the root vegetable into approximately 1 gram cubes.b) Place one gram of the root vegetable in a blender with 100 ml. distilled water or pH 7 buffer.c) Blend it thoroughly at high speed for about 1 minute.d) Filter the extract.Time RequiredThis enzyme activity laboratory requires four classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion,and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students require the following: spectrophotometer, test holders, rack.marking pencil, pipets, distilled water, root extract. guaiacol solution, and hydrogen peroxide. PeroxidaseIn this laboratory you will study the enzyme peroxidase from a root vegetable. Peroxidases are widelydistributed in plant and animal cells and catalyze the oxidation of organic compounds by hydrogen peroxideas follows:RH + 21-1202peroxidase.ROH +HZO1. What are the substrates of this reaction? 2. What are the products? 653 Any cell using molecular oxygen in its metabolism will produce small amounts of H20, as a highly toxicby-product. It is critical that the H20, be quickly removed by enzymes such as peroxidase before damage isdone to the cell.You will use a reducing agent. guaiaco!, that changes color when it is oxidized. This change can be easilymeasured with the spectrophotometer.4 guaiacol + 21-1202peroxidastLtetraguaiacol +(colorless) (brown) 3. How is this similar to the reaction in some fruits and vegetables when their flesh is cut and exposed to air? AbsorbanceA colored solution such as oxidized guaiacol solution appears that way because some of the light enteringthe solution is absorbed by the colored substance. A clear solution will allow almost all of the light to passthrough. The amount of absorbance can be determined by using a spectrophotometer, which measuresquantitatively what fraction of the light is transmitted through a given solution. It also indicates on the absor-bance scale the amount of light absorbed compared to that absorbed by a clear solution. The darker the solution,the greater the absorbance.Transmittance (T) is the ratio of the transmitted light (I) of the sample to the incident light (10) on the sample.T =I This value is multiplied by 100 to derive the term % T. For example:T = 50 = 0.50and%T = 50 x 100 = 50%100 100Absorbance (A) is the logarithm to the base 10 of the reciprocal of the transmittance:A = log,ITFor example. if %T of 50 was recorded then A = logo, I=0.5Thus. log, 2.0 = 0.602 A. One advantage of absorbance calculations is that they are logarithmically ratherthan arithmetically derived, which allows the use of Beer's law. Beer's law states that over a given concentrationrange the concentration of solute molecules is directly proportional to absorbance. Beer's law can be expressed as:log,o= Ecl = A: where,I = intensity of incident light;I= intensity of transmitted light:E = the molar extinction coefficient, a constant value that is characteristic for each substance;c = concentration of solution: and.I = the length of the light path through the solution in centimeters. 5164 The usefulness of absorbance can be seen in figure one:1001 .8I 75 j.11 .6 .1 versus% transmittance absorbanceFigure 1 Because absorbance is proportional to concentration, a plot of absorbance versus concentrationyields a straight line. the slope of which represents the constant E. Such a plot is called a calibration, or standardcurve. Once several points have been plotted, the student can extrapolate the intervening points by connectingthe known points with a straight line.4. What would be the advantages of working with a straight line graph in analyses of chemical reactions? Beer's Law tends to break down in excessively strong concentrations. If the concentration/absorption figuresbeing plotted begin to curve, it is necessary to dilute the unknown sample by some factor until the absorbancereadings intersect with the straight line paf t of the graph where concentration is proportional to absorbance.It is then possible to determine the unknown concentration and multiply the value by the dilution factor.StepsA. When you are ready to practice using the spectrophotometer, use figure two to follow standard spec-trophotometer procedures.pilotlamptransmittance controllight controlFigure 2 52 1). Turn on the instrument with the power switch knob. Allow 5 minutes for warm up.2). Adjust the wavelength dial to 500 nanometers.3). With the sample chamber empty and the cover closed. use the power switch knob to set the meterneedle to read infinity absorbance.4).Fill a spectrophotometer tube or cuvette halfway with distilled water to make a blank. Wipe it freeof moisture or fingerprints with a lint free tissue, and insert it into the sample holder. Line up the etched markwith the raised line on the front of the sample holder, and close the cover.5). With the right hand knob, adjust the meter to read zero absorbance.6). Remove the cuvette, empty it. and shake it as dry as possible. This precaution is essential for accuracy.7).Fill a sample cuvette with food coloring tinted water and insert III the spectrophotometer.8). Read absorbance directly from the meter. Rinse the cuvette with clean water and shake it as dryas possible.9).It is necessary to reset the machine to infinity absorbance and zero absorbance with a blank beforeeach set of readings because the settings can drift. Whenever the wavelength is changed, the infinity and zeroabsorbance also must be reset.B. Once you have learned how to operate the spectrophotometer. the next preparatory step in the studyof the kinetics of the peroxidase reacton will. be to learn how to pipet. Pipets will be used to measure the solutions.Practice using a pipet with sterile water until you are comfortable with the techniques of pipetting.C. Label the pipets with a marking pencil so each one can be reused with the proper solution. Be sureto use a different pipet for each solution so that the reagents are not ruined by cross contamination.D. Label a cuvette \"1. It will contain everything but the final compound needed for a reaction to occur,and it will be the blank for the experiment. Add by pipet 0.4 ml. guaiacol, 3.0 ml. of root extract, and 6.6ml. distilled water. Mix well.E. Label two test tubes \"2 and \"3. The contents of \"2 and \"3 will be mixed to start the reaction.1). Tube \"2: add by pipet 0.4 ml. guaiacol, 0.6 ml. 3% KO,. and 3.0 ml. distilled water.2). Tube \"3: add by pipet 3.() ml. root extract and 3.0 ml. distilled water. FAdjust the spectrophotometer to zero absorbance using cuvette \"1. following steps specified in A above.You have now set the instrument so that any difference in the meter reading with a change in the samplewill reflect a difference in oxidized guaiacol concentration.5. Why is this step important? G Obtain a stopwatch. or use a watch with a second hand or timer device on it, to time step H.H. Obtain a clean cuvette and label it \"4. You will have only 20 seconds to perform the following stepsof mixing, pouring, wiping, inserting, and reading the spectrophotometer. When you are ready, do the following:1). Mix the contents of test tubes \"2 and \"3. pour the contents back and forth two times quickly. andthen pour into cuvette \"4. Start the stopwatch or timer when the tubes are first mixed. (t = 0 when the tubesare first mixed.)2). Wipe the outside of the cuvette and place it in the spectrophotometer. 53 3). Take your first reading 20 seconds after the tubes were mixed. (t = 20 seconds.)4). Continue to read the absorbance every 20 seconds for 4 minutes. I.Repeat the procedure twice more to verify the accuracy of your base line data.6.

During subsequent procedures you will vary one condition at a time andcompare the results against the base line. Since your base line will affect all subsequent readings. have yourinstructor check the base line graph before proceeding.Procedure: Hour 2Students need the same supplies for hour 2 as they used for hour 1.It is possible to determine an enzyme's optimum. or most efficient reaction rate by testing varying physicalconditions of reaction and by determining which factors contribute to a rapid and complete enzymatic reaction.Since enzymes are organic compounds, it is to be expected that their optimum reaction rates are boundedby the narrow and precise conditions found within living systems. Hours 2, 3 and 4 of this laboratory will bedevoted to testing the physical conditions which provide levels of optimum activity for peroxidase.It has been found that the following conditions impact upon the activity of enzymes.Concentration of Enzyme and SubstrateBy varying the amounts of the enzyme and/or the substrate it works upon, the speed of the reaction iseither speeded up or slowed down. The reaction will only proceed as rapidly as there are materials availableto react, and even though enzymes are not used up in the reaction. they are required for it to work.TemperatureChemical reactions speed up as temperature is raised. As temperature increases. more molecules acquireenough kinetic energy to begin reacting. However, if the temperature of an enzyme catalyzed reaction is raisedhigh enough, a temperature optimum is reached. Above this temperature optimum, kinetic energy is so greatthat the structure of the enzyme starts to degrade, leading to denaturation. Many proteins and enzymes aredenatured by temperatures around 40\u00b0 to 50\u00b0 C., but a few can even survive boiling. It depends on the particularenzyme and the type of living system to which it is adapted. p1-1pH is given on a logarithmic scale which measures the acidity. or hydrogen ion concentration in a solution.The scale runs from 0 to 14. with 0 being the highest in acidity and 14 the lowest, or most basic. A pH of7 is neutral. Amino acid side chains contain groups such as COOH and NH, which readily gain or losehydrogen ions. As pH is lowered, an enzyme will tend to gain hydrogen ions, and eventually enough sidechains will be affected to disrupt the active shape of the enzyme. The opposite happens as the pH is raised.but with similar negative results. Many enzymes have an optimum in the neutral pH range and are denaturedby low or high pH. Some enzymes, such as those which act in the acidic human stomach. have an appropri-ately low pH optimum.Salt ConcentrationIf salt concentration is very low or very high. the charged amino acid side chains of enzymes stick together.The enzymes will be denatured and form an inactive precipitate from the solution. An intermediate saltconcentration, such as that of blood (0.9%), is the optimum for most enzymes.Activators and InhibitorsMolecules other than the substrate may interact with enzymes. If the molecule increases the rate of thereaction, it is called an activator. If it decreases the rate of reaction, it is called an inhibitor. The cell ises suchmolecules to regulate reaction rates. Any substance that tends to unfold the enzyme. such as an organic 56 GO solvent or detergent, will act as an inhibitor. Some inhibitors act by reducing disulfide bridges that stabilize theenzyme's structure. Many inhibitors react with side chains in or near the active site. Others may damage orremove the active site on the enzyme. Many well known poisons are enzyme inhibitors which interfere withthe active sites on critical enzymes.StepsA. The effect of enzyme concentration will now be measured by doubling the amount of enzyme usedto establish the base line during hour one.8. Notice that during this laboratory cuvette \"1 always contains 10 ml.. and test tubes 42 and 03 togetheralways total 10 ml. Why is this important? B.Follow the procedure as outlined in hour 1, but vary the materials in the cuvettes in this fashion:1). Cuvette \"1. Add 0.4 ml. guaiacol, 6.0 ml. root extract, and 3.6 ml. distilled water.2).

What conclusions can be reached concerning the effects of peroxidase, and hydrogen peroxide concen-trations on reaction rates? Procedure: Hour 3Students require all materials and equipment used in laboratory hours 1 and 2, plus the boiling water baths.The water baths of 4\u00b0. 15\u00b0. 30\u00b0. and 37\u00b0 C. should be set up before class.The purpose of this exercise is to determine the effects of temperature on enzyme activity. The experimentwill show the differences in peroxidase activity between 4 and 37 degrees centigrade. Use the same conditionsas in the base line experiment, but run the reaction in the different temperature water baths. There will besome small percentage of error as the solutions change temperature after removal from the water baths andinsertion in the spectrophotometer: however, this error does not skewer the results substantially.

Hydroxylannine is a small molecule whose structure is similar enough to hydrogen peroxide that it canbind peroxidase.

LaboratoryPhotosynthesis & Bioluminescence When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Use the spectrophotometer to measure the visible absorp-tion spectrum of spinach chloroplasts.2.Determine the wavelengths most useful for photosynthesisin spinach chloroplasts.3.Understand the Hill reaction and its relationship to oxygenproduction and photosynthetic electron transport.4.Demonstrate the effect of changing the level of light onelectron transport in photosynthesis by measuring reductionof a dye in the Hill reaction.5.Demonstrate how the stored energy of photosynthesis canbe changed into light energy. PurposePhotosynthesis is the essential biochemical process of life. No life, neither that which produces its ownfood through photosynthesis nor that which ultimately derives its food from green plants. is possible withoutphotosynthesis. It is a complicated chemical sequence which can best be expressed as:nH20 + nCO2> (CH20), + nO2The (CH,O)n in the equation is most often glucose. C6H1206.Photosynthesis is carried on by organisms which are capable of \"trapping\" light in special light receptorsystems. In green plants these light receptor systems are chloroplasts, and they are required for the light reac-tions of photosynthesis. in which light energy is converted to chemical energy (ATP or NADPH) through anelectron transport system. The ATP or NADPH feed into the assembly line of the dark reaction, or Calvincycle. where enzymes carry out carbon fixation by converting CO, into glucose.The dark reactions of photosynthesis are so named because they can occur in the absence of light. Duringthe dark reactions, the energy stored in ATP or NADPH is used to convert CO, and H2O to primarily glucosemolecules and oxygen gas. All life forms incapable of photosynthesis are, in one way or another, dependentupon that glucose for food.The purpose of this laboratory is to explore some of the properties and reactions of photosynthesis. andto show how the energy obtained from photosynthesis can be converted into either the chemical energy offood or the light energy of bioluminescence.Pre-labMaterials needed for exploring the properties and reactions chlorophyll extract 1) Spectrophotometers: instruments used by the students should be equipped with a wide range photo-tube and filter (CE A95) to measure the absorption spectrum of chlorophyll. Standard spectrophotometerscan not be zeroed above 650 nanometers (or 669 in some cases) with the visible phototubes. and studentswill not be able to see the absorption maximum in the 660 to 670 nm. region. The wide range phototubecan be used in demonstrating absorption spectra in the Hill reaction as well, if students wish to quantify thislaboratory after hour 2.2) 80% acetone: mix 200 ml. distilled water and 800 ml. acetone. Keep tightly covered.3) 0.5 M. cold. buffered sucrose and2.72 g. KH2130, in 800 ml. distilled water. Adjust to pH 6.8 with 1 M. NaOH (10 g. NaOH dissolved in25 ml. distilled water) and bring the total volume to 1 liter. Store tightly covered in a refrigerator.4) Diluted chlorophyll extract: dry fresh spinach leaves as much as possible. Add 200 ml. acetone to ablender full of dried spinach and blend. Pour off the acetone into a flask and cover it. Re-extract the residuein the blender with 100 ml. 95% ethanol. Pour off the alcohol extract and combine it with the acetone extract.Filter the combined extracts through a Whatman #1 filter paper. If the extract is not a nice dark green color.add enough CaC1, to separate the extract into two layers. The pigments will become concentrated in the upperlayer and can be removed with a pipet or isolated with a separatory funnel. This produces a concentratedpigment. Dilute with 80% acetone until the absorbance at 400 nm. is about 0.7 on the spectrophotometer.Keep dark and refrigerated in a tightly covered, foil-wrapped bottle.Note: Students can spend class time making the chlorophyll extract as a way to familiarize themselveswith the laboratory.5) 2.6-dichlorophenol-indolphenol dye. or 2.5 x 10' which is knownas DCIP. dissolve 72.5 mg.

Lanterns are naturally available in some areasIf it is the wrong time of year. or the wrong area. they may be purchased commercially. such as Sigma. #FFT.7) ADP (adenosine 5' -diphosphate): available from Sigma. #A 2754.8) PMS (phenazine methosulfate): available from a few suppliers, including Sigma. #P 9625. Time RequiredThis photosynthesis laboratory requires three classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion,and review.8774 Procedure: Hour 1The absorption spectrum of spinach chlorophyll will be studied during this hour.Students need the following materials and equipment: spectrophotometer. cuvettes. 80% acetone.diluted chlorophyll extract, tissues.A given molecule can occupy only particular energy levels, that is. it can absorb quanta of only certain specificenergies (or wavelengths). An absorption spectrum is a plot for a given compound of the degree to which lightis absorbed at given wavelengths. The fact that the peaks in an absorption spectrum are smoothly rounded.rather than sharp spikes. suggests that a given excited state is not a narrow band of energy; rather, it consistsof substantial energy sublevels. differing by small increments. Therefore. absorption spectra are very good \"fin-gerprints\" of compounds. and unknown compounds sometimes can be identified by their absorption spectra.StepsStudents should review spectrophotometer procedure as detailed in laboratory '47 on enzyme activity.Additionally, remember that the solvent. acetone. used in this experiment dissolves plastic. Be careful notto spill any solvent on or in the spectrophotometer.A. Turn on the spectrophotometer and allow it to warm up for 5 10 minutes.BFill a cuvette halfway with 80% acetone to use as a blank.C. Fill a second cuvette halfway with diluted chlorophyll extract.D. Turn the wavelength control knob to 400 nm. Zero the instrument by inserting the blank and adjustingthe control knob to zero absorbancy. Do not forget that the white line of the cuvette should face you.E. Insert the cuvette containing the chlorophyll extract. and take the first reading.F. Change the wavelength to 410 nm.. reset the spectrophotometer. and take the second reading.G. Continue taking readings every 10 nm. until reaching 700 nm.1. Record these readings in the chart. figure one. below. wavelength ',absorbance-4-400nm. 4_4i- -4-- -...._...._ ......wavelengthabsorbance Figure 1 754. (.;%./ Figure 2 765 3 2. Graph wavelength versus absorbance from figure one onto the preceding graph, figure two. Label eachabsorbance maximum (where the absorbance rises and then falls again) with its corresponding wavelength.If there are not at least two absorbance maxima in the spectrophotometer readings. go back to the regionsof high absorbance and take more readings.3. Does the absorption spectrum of dilute chlorophyll extract from spinach leaves indicate that spinach hasmore than one photosynthetic pigment in it? What might account for this? 4.Is there any wavelength at which no absorbance at all occurs? Why or why not? Although the absorption spectrum graph relates light absorption to wavelength. the biological effectivenessof light can be plotted as a function of wavelength. The resulting graph is called an action spectrum. Actionspectra graphs plot relative rate of photosynthesis against wavelength.Optional ActivitiesStudents may wish to trace photosynthetic abilities of a particular plant over a period of time. Each studentshould \"adopt\" a plant and track its ( hlorophyll absorption spectra over a period of two months, or longer.using the following procedures. When done, prepare a formal laboratory report to be handed in to your instructor.1) Follow the procedures for hour 1 of this laboratory. except use the chosen plant's leaves for makingthe dilute chlorophyll extract.2) Take spectrophotometer readings between 400 to 700 nm. on the chlorophyll extract. Collect the leavesfresh and test every two weeks during the period.3) Record readings in a chart similar to the one in hour 1 of this laboratory, graph wavelength versusabsorbance. and date each entry. These will document light absorbance by the plant over an extended period.4) Compare findings with other students who ''adopted\" other plants. Consider similarities and differencesin findings What influences might such phenomena as environment. seasonal cycles. and species have onthe data? 77rj 0 Procedure: Hour 2The Hill reaction (the phase of photosynthesis which requires light) will be studied during this hour.Students need the following materials and equipment: fresh spinach leaves. 0.5 M. cold buffered sucrosesolution. blender. centrifuge and centrifuge tubes, cheesecloth, glass rod, microscope, slides and coverslips,tissues. 0.1 M. phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 2.6 dichlorophenol-indolphenol, distilled water, test tubes, test tuberack, aluminum foil, and a beaker or ice bucket with iced water.Robin Hill of Cambridge University was the first to observe that illumination of isolated chloroplastsresulted in the production of oxygen gas. This light-induced production of oxygen through photosynthetic electrontransport is called the Hill reaction. The general reaction may be simplified thus:H2O + Alight>AH2 + 1/2 02in which A is a general hydrogen acceptor and AH2 is the reduced form. Light provides energy to move elec-trons from water during the Hill reaction. This is the opposite of respiration in which electrons join with 02to form H2O. NADP + is the electron carrier (A in the above reaction), and it is reduced to NADPH.In this experiment the student will use an artificial electron acceptor, the dye 2,6 dichlorophenol-indolphenol,as the A in the above reaction. As the dye accepts electrons liberated by light energy, there should be a changein color. indicating that the dye has been reduced.StepsA. Prepare the chloroplast suspension as follows. This suspension will be used in both hours 2 and 3 ofthis laboratory.Note: The following procedure must be carried out using cold solutions and glassware, aschloroplasts deteriorate at warm temperatures.1).

The fresh water plants Elodea and Anacharis are both commonly found in tropical fish stores. Both plantsrelease oxygen gas as bubbles in the water in direct proportion to their photosynthetic activity. How mightyou devise an experiment using one of these plants to measure photosynthetic rate and also maximum wave-length absorbance? How might you include an action spectrum of the photosynthetic pigments of the plantin the experiment? Answer in the space provided below. Procedure: Hour 3Bioluminescence will be studied during this hour.BackgroundA classic story about bioluminescence occurred during WWII. American soldiers fighting in the Philippinejungles were mystified as to how Japanese attackers could strike with such coordinated effectiveness on darknights. After the war the Americans learned that the Japanese had netted small phosphorescent fish. driedthem, and ground the dried fish into a powder which was carried in leather pouches on their belts. On eventhe darkest nights the Japanese could communicate between detachments by using hand signals naturally illu-minated with this fish powder.During the Arab Israeli War of 1967. a midnight patrol of Israeli soldiers spotted a faint green light hoveringin the waters of the Red Sea along the shores of the Sinai Peninsula. They fired explosive shells into the glow-ing area which they took to be enemy frogmen. Instead they killed a school of flashlight fish. These fish inhabitunderwater caves and come to the surface of the sea on dark. moonless nights to forage for small organisms.Their sources of light are bioluminescent bacteria located in packets just under their eyes, which give off asteady green glow. The bacteria serve as efficient \"headlights: and the flashlight fish can turn them on andoff by blinking.There are many other examples of bioluminescence in nature, but the majority of organisms with the traitare bacteria. Bioluminescent bacteria live both in the water and on the land. Wax moth larvae can glow inthe dark because of bioluminescent bacteria living inside them. Bioluminescent bacteria, particularily the onesliving in association with flashlight fish. live in pure cultures. Scientists have been able to use these pure culturebacteria in genetic recombination studies by employing them as markers.Even stranger than glowing bacteria are bacteria cultures which can generate sufficient electricity to powera light bulb. These bacteria have a purplish red pigment in their cells which efficiently converts ATP into electri-cal energy. Research continues on turning these bacteria into living solar batteries.LaboratoryStudents need the following: the chloroplast suspension prepared and used in hour 2 of this laboratory.phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). firefly lanterns, centrifuge and centrifuge tubes. ice bucket or beaker with icedwater. ADP. PMS. test tubes and rack. pipets. 50 ml. chilled flask, source of light (sunlight or lamp). and adarkened area.The Dark ReactionPlants use sunlight as a source of energy to produce ATP. ATP is stored in the stroma of chloroplasts. andit provides the energy for the synthesis of carbohydrates. This synthesis is called the dark reaction of photosynthesis.The dark reaction occurs whether or not light is available. It is a complicated chemical sequence which canbest be expressed as: AH, (from the Hill reaction) + CO2 ATP> carbohydratesThis reaction is reversed when animals ingest plants or other animals and then metabolically break downcarbohydrates to yield ATP. ATP fuels their metabolic processes. Phrased differently. sunlight is the ultimateenergy source, but ATP is the usable energy source. And ATP can be converted into food. light, or electricity. 8194 Bioluminescence in FirefliesIn the following experiment. you will illuminate isolated chloroplasts to make ATP and then use the ATPas an energy source to cause firefly lanterns to \"glow.\"ATP provides the energy needed to attach a molecule of oxygen to a luciferin molecule in the firefly.Luciferin is the active molecule manufactured in firefly bodies which is responsible for bioluminescence. Theenzyme luciferase breaks down the luciferin/oxygen complex. Light is emitted in the process (one photon permolecule). The energy of the end products of the reaction (CO, and AMP, among others) is less than thatof the starting materials (luciferin-02 and ATP). and the energy difference is released as light. Itis bestexpressed as: luciferin + 02 >luciferin02 complex ATPAMP light + CO2 + products StepsWhile preparing the chloroplast suspension for the hour 2 experiment. electron acceptor molecules werewashed away. During this hour you will provide an artificial electron acceptor. phenazine methosulfate (PMS)to replace them. You also will add ADP and inorganic phosphorus (in the form of a phosphate buffer) becausethese also were washed out of the chloroplast suspension.Note: Make sure equipment is kept ice cold throughout the procedure. Heat destroys isolatedchloroplasts.A. Put 12 drops phosphate buffer (pH 7.8) in a small test tube. Add 4 firefly lanterns. Homogenize themixture with a chilled glass rod. Place test tube in iced water for 30 minutes.B. While waiting. prepare the following chloroplast solution. In a chilled 50 ml. flask. using chilled pipets.carefully transfer 9 drops phosphate buffer (pH 7.8). 6 drops ADP, 6 drops PMS. and 6 drops chloroplastsuspension (use the chloroplast suspension prepared during hour 2).C. Gently shake the flask to mix it. and place the flask in an ice bucket or beaker with iced water. Thecontainer is to be illuminated for at least 10 minutes by either bright sunlight or lamps.D. Suck the contents of each flask into separate chilled pipets (the firefly and chloroplast mixtures atthis point it is preferable to have a good pipetting technique). Place both pipets in separate test tubes. Squirtthe firefly extract into its test tube and remove the pipet. Leave the chloroplast mixture in its pipet.E. The last step must be done in the dark. Darken the laboratory (or visit a darkroom). Wait until youreyes become adjusted to the dark. Then squirt the chloroplast contents into the test tube containing firefly extract. 12.

LaboratoryRespiration & Fermentation When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Determine the relationship between food concentration andenergy production in yeast.2.Distinguish between aerobic and anaerobic fermentation.3.Demonstrate the procedure of serial dilution. As discussed in the previous laboratory. ATP is the primary energy carrier in living systems, and sunlightis the ultimate energy source. Photosynthetic processes convert the sun's energy into chemical energy, mostoften stored temporarily in the high energy bonds of ATP. For long term storage, plants convert the ATPinto carbohydrates. Non-photosynthetic organisms. as well as plants. are able to break down these carbohy-drates and to convert them back to ATP. Common to all organisms is the process of glycolysis, which is theprocedure of breaking down the simplest carbohydrate of all, glucose. Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm ofthe cell. We will consider this process in the following laboratory. Respiratory PathwaysCellular respiration may be achieved with or without oxygen, aerobically or anaerobically. Aerobic respi-ration is the most efficient form of energy recovery: for each molecule of glucose broken down, 38 ATP moleculesare generated. The overall reaction looks like this: glucose + oxygen > carbon dioxide + water + energy; or.+ 602> 6CO2 + 6H2O + energy The oldest and most common respiratory pathway is that of anerobic respiration or fermentation. In fer-mentation each molecule of glucose yields only 2 molecules of ATP. Many aerobes retain the ability to fer-ment, but most of them have lost the ability to dump the end products of fermentation. The end productsof fermentation are energy, carbon dioxide, and either alcohol or lactic acid. For example. the muscle cellsof humans can ferment (make energy by respiring without oxygen) in emergencies. but the build up of lacticacid and ethyl alcohol produces fatigue and muscle cramps. Human cells must aerobically respire in orderto change wastes to carbon dioxide and water.Some oganisms can function as either aerobes or anaerobes. They are called facultative anaerobes. Yeastsand many bacteria are anaerobes. They can maintain themselves without oxygen. When oxygen becomesavailable, they can aerobically respire and burn their accumulated biochemical garbage (lactic acid or alcohol).using the burning to produce extra energy. At these times they can multiply very fast.The purpose of the following procedure is to measure the relationship between available food and theamount of energy released by a simple organism. a yeast.Pre-labCollect the following equipment and materials. 879 0 distilled waterglass stirring rodmarking penmillimeter rulertest 13 x mm.(10 group)Equipment Materialstest tubes, 22 x 175 mm.(10 pipets dry yeastmolasses Special Preparations1) The 13 x 100 mm. test tubes should be lipless. They will serve as large durham tubes and fit upsidedown inside the large test tubes.2) Make a stock yeast suspension for the class by dissolving a package, or 1 tablespoon, dry yeast in 1liter warm water.3)It is best to use warm (nothot)molasse-. in the laboratory. Students have less chance of becomingsticky during their measurements. Time RequiredThisrespiration laboratory requires two classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion, andreview. Procedure: Hour 1Students need all materials and equipment listed in the Pre-lab.Studies using baker's or brewer's y( ast have provided much of our present knowledge of carbohydrate me-tabolism. Both are varieties of Saccharomyces cereuisiae. This yeast derives its name from an early observationthat it is a sugar consuming fungus, therefore, the name Saccharomyces (saccharum = sugar, and myces =fungus).Common yeast is a anaerobe. When maintained under anaerobic conditions, S. cereuisiae formsalcohol and carbon dioxide from sugar. This process is called an ethanolic or alcoholic fermentation. The over-all equation is: Sucrose + water C121-122011 + H2Oyeast> carbon dioxide + energy: or.yeast> 4CH,C1-120H + 4CO2 + energy. It is easy to measure the amount of carbon dioxide production. Since carbon dioxide production is propor-tional to energy production. measurement of carbon dioxide production indirectly yields a figure for energyproduction. 881 StepsA. Number the large test tubes from \"1 to #10.B. Prepare a yeast suspension by adding 30 ml. of the stock yeast suspension to 70 ml. distilled waterin a 125 ml. flask.C. Prepare. by serial dilution in the ten large test tubes, a series of molasses concentrations from very highin test tube #10, to very low in test tube \"1. This is done as follows:1). Measure 25 ml. molasses and pour it into test tube #10.2). Measure another 25 ml. molasses into the graduated cylinder and add 25 ml. distilled water. Shakethe mixture. stir it with a glass rod. and pour it back and forth from the graduated cylinder to aflask until it is evenly mixed. Pour 25 ml. of the mixture into test tube \"9. Save the remaining 25ml. in the flask.3). Measure 25 ml. distilled water into the graduated cylinder and add the molasses/water you leftin the flask. Again, mix it together completely. and pour 25 ml. of the mixture into test tube #8.Save the remaining 25 ml. in the flask.4). Repeat this operation until all ten test tubes are filled with 25 ml. each of varying dilutions ofmolasses/water. Discard the remaining 25 ml. mixture from the flask.The molasses concentration in the ten test Thoroughly shake the flask containing the 100 ml. yeast suspension, and pipet 5 ml. yeast suspensioninto each test tube, \"1 through 010. Thoroughly mix the yeast suspension with the molasses and watermixture in each test tube. by placing your thumb over the test tube mouth and shaking vigorously. Cleanand dry your thumb before proceeding to the next test tube to avoid any mixing of concentration ratios.E. Put a small test tube upside down into each of the ten large tubes. It may be easier (particularly withtest tube \"10) to carefully fill the small test tube to the brim with the contents of the large test tube, and thento quickly upend it into the larger test tube. Repeat the proce e until there are no air bubbles left insidethe small tube. If this is impossible (depending upon the thickness of the molasses). carefully measure thelength of the air bubble with a millimeter ruler and record the measurement.F. Carefully place your labeled test tube rack with its test tubes \"1 through \"10 in a convenient area anddo not disturb for 24 hours.Procedure: Hour 2Students will need all materials and equipment set up during hour 1. 89 StepsA.

They can submittheir results to the instructor in a formal laboratory report.1). Students can repeat the above experiment but use sucrose, or glucose, or fructose, instead of molas-ses. They can then compare the results with the obtained from molasses. They can alternately run the ex-periment using a mixture of the three sugars.2). Students can repeat the above experiment under different temperature conditions. They can then con-sider the impact of temperature on yeast activity.3).

DiscussionElectrophoresis When you have completed this discussion you should be able to: 1.Describe electrophoretic processes. 2.Discuss the different physical and chemical factors affectingelectrophoretic data and results.3.Give examples of research applications of electrophoresis. DefinitionElectrophoresis is a separation technique which utilizes the fact that substances move at different rates whensubjected to an electrical current, depending upon their molecular size and electrical charge. Electrophoresisis a useful and relatively simple technique for the separation and study of the properties of single chargedmolecules, particularly proteins and nucleic acids. BackgroundSickle Cell Anemia and ElectrophoresisLinus Pau ling. an American chemist. used the techniques of electrophoresis to study the structure ofhemoglobin. Pau ling reasoned that a disease such as sickle cell anemia might reflect a deviation in the proteinstructure of the hemoglobin molecule. Pauling built upon a Nobel Prize winning discovery in 1941 by twocolleagues. George Beadle and Edward L. Tatum. of the California Institute of Technology. They haddemonstrated that a mutation of one gene could be correlated with the loss of function of one enzyme.Pauling applied this idea of one gene-one enzyme (or polypeptide chain) to his theory of sickle cell anemiaas a hemoglobin mutation. He took samples of hemoglobin from people with sickle cell anemia. from othersheterozygous for the gene. and from still others homozygous for the normal gene. Pauling dissolved the threetypes of hemoglobin in a solution and subjected them to a weak electric field. Their electrophoretic separationcurves were different, with normal hemoglobin being the most negatively charged. This difference had notpreviously been demonstrated.A few years later Vernon Ingram. of Cambridge University in England. was able to show that theactual difference between normal and sickle cell hemoglobin molecules is only one amino acid in threehundred.Linus Pauling's results shed new light not only on sickle cell anemia but also on the entire concept of geneticdominance and recessiveness. Note in the following chart, which illustrates Pauling's electrophoretic results.that the individual heterozygous for the trait actually produces both types of hemoglobin but that there is enoughof the normal type to prevent the individual from displaying the disease. The three types of hemo-globin formed definite, distinct reactions to the electric field, pointing generally to what took years ofbiochemical research to prove. 977 normal hemoglobin sickle cell anemia Figure 1 Protein Mobility and ArcheologyAll proteins have an electric charge determined by their amino acid composition, and when in solution,they can move in an electric field. An estimate of structural differences between proteins.can be made fromthe amount of difference in their mobility. Some proteins. such as collagens of bone and skin. keratins, andseed proteins, are often preserved over time, allowing electrophoretic techniques to be used on fossil materials.Such results are used 4-.) trace phylogeny. Genetic VariabilityAnalysis at the molecular level is one method for assessing genetic variability. Such variability is char-acteristic of nearly all natural populations. and it is useful to be able to quantify similarities and differences.Electrophoretic techniques can be used to measure allelic differences in organisms which are difficult tobreed, because electrophoresis does not require direct analysis of the genes themselves. Literally hundredsof species have been analyzed electrophoretically. The results demonstrate the extensiveness and univer-sality of genetic variation. MedicineThe medical field utilizes electrophoretic techniques in several ways. For example. it has been used to studythe defect in which some people produce excessive numbers of plasma lipoproteins. A lipoprotein is amulticomponent complex of protein and lipids of a characteristic density. molecular weight. size. and chemicalcomposition. These complexes of protein and lipid are held together by noncovalent forces. While a typicalchemical composition and molecular weight exists for each type of lipoprotein complex. there may exist noexact structural integrity. Lipoproteins serve a wide variety of functions in cellular membranes and in the trans-port and metabolism of lipids. Plasma lipoproteins transport lipids from the sites of their absorption into bloodto the various tissues of the person where lipids are utilized.Through electrophoresis four classes of plasma lipoproteins have been identified in tasting humans. Throughthe separation and classification of these lipoproteins with electrophoretic technology, doctors are now able 98 to note the side effects which can occur in humans having too many circulating lipoproteins. They can sufferfrom increased risk of atherosclerosis and high levels of cholesterol, as well as diabetes mellitus and chronicpancreatitis.Electrophoretic TechniquesThe underlying principle of electrophoresis is that any charged particle suspended between the polesof an electric field tends to travel toward the pole bearing the charge opposite its own. The rate at which ittravels is conditioned by such factors as the characteristics of the particle itself, the properties of the electricalfield, and the nature of the medium it is traveling through. Its mobility is also affected by such environ-mental factors as temperature and humidity. Generally, however, the mobility of a particle is proportionalto its charge/mass ratio.Electrophoretic mobility is the rate at which a particle moves under a controlled set of circumstances. Be-cause of the variabilities noted above, results are comparable only when derived from the same, or same typeof electrophoretic instrument and similar environmental conditions. In other words, absolute quantities cannot be derived, but comparative results can be realized.The area upon which electrophoretic separation occurs is called the bed. The bed can be composed ofany number of materials, including gels, films, and powders. It is moistened with an electrolytic solution, usual-ly buffered, and the ends of the bed are immersed in electrolyte contained in two chambers. The chambersare designed to hold electrodes connected to a direct current power source. The electrolyte level in the elec-trode chambers must be held stable so that siphoning from the bed does not invalidate results. Also, the entireapparatus must be held in an airtight chamber to minimize evaporation of buffer.There are two basic types of electrophoresis, free solution electrophoresis and zone electrophoresis. Free Solution ElectrophoresisIn free solution electrophoresis. the sample to be analyzed is dissolved in a liquid, and the sample isfractionated in a U tube. First the tube is filled with unstabilized buffer. The sample then is injected into thesystem through a capillary tube sidearm at the bottom of the U tube. An elaborate optical system locates andmeasures movement of sample fractions through the tube.There are many cost and technical difficulties in maintaining free solution electrophoresis set ups, suchas maintaining careful thermal regulation and avoiding vibration interference. Because of this, electrophoretictechniques which employ stabilization media such as gels are more often used. Nevertheless, free solutionelectrophoresis is more precise and remains the standard reference for measuring electrophoretic mobilities. Zone ElectrophoresisIn zone electrophoresis. stabilizing media are used which separate sample material into discrete zones, orbands. These zones can be snipped out and analyzed. A wide variety of materials have been used. Filter paper,cellulose acetate strips, starch powder, cellulose powder. ion exchange paper, glass microbeads, starch gel.agar gel (also known as agarose), and synthetic gels such as polyacrilamide gel have all been used as mediain zone electrophoresis.An important technical variation on zone electrophoresis is that of immunoelectrophoresis. Immunoelec-trophoresis is a technique whereby biological materials are separated into fractions by zone electrophoresis,and the fractions are allowed to react with immune serum after diffusing into the electrophoretic bed. Sincethis adds a very specific detection technique (a precipitin reaction) to electrophoresis, it is possible to separatemany additional fractions in a protein mixture. 99lu When the purpose of an electrophoretic procedure is more to prepare a significant amount of purified sub-stance for analysis, rather than simple detection, the capacity of the bed can be increased by layering it thicklywith some absorbent material, such as starch powder or cotton.

LaboratoryGel Electrophoresis When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Explain the process of gel electrophoresis.2.Achieve enzyme in specially prepared media.4.Visually show zones of LDH activity on agarose gel.5.Explain the applications and techniques of isoelectric focus-ing in gel electrophoresis. PurposeElectrophoresis utilizes the fact that charged molecules in solution migrate in response to an electrical field.If executed with care and precision. electrophoresis can yield valuable information about those molecules.In this laboratory the student will have an opportunity to practice electrophoretic technique by separatingisoenzymes.Amphoteric ProteinsMost proteins are amphoteric compounds. That means that they contain both acidic and basic residuesand that their net charge is determined by the pH of their medium. Each protein has its own characteristicproperties, depending upon the number and kind of amino acids of which it is cor.,.pc.)sed. Amino acids possessboth carboxyl (-COOH C00- + H +) and amino groups (-NH, t H -.NH,and these groups become electrically charged when ionized. Isoelectric PointsAmphoteric proteins have a pH at which there is no net electrical charge. This pH is called the isoelectricpoint. Just as proteins have their own characteristic properties. so too do they have their own isoelectric points.For example, normal human hemoglobin has an isoelectric point at pH 7.07. Abu. e the isoelectric point ofa protein, the protein will have a net negative charge, and it will migrate toward the anode in an electricalfield until it reaches its isoelectric point. Below the isoelectric point, the protein will have a net positive charge.and it will migrate toward the cathode. The pH of solutions in an electrophoreiic system must be kept constantto maintain a steady charge and protein mobility. To do this the solutions must be buffered.Nucleic acids are exceptions. Although they are proteins, they are not amphoteric and remain negativeat any p1-I. isoelectric Focusing and Ampholy. tesIsoelectric focusing is a special elcctrophoretic technique that uses special buffers in the separation of proteinswhich differ but slightly in their icoelectric points. These buffers are called ampholytes. They maintain a constant 103Z' 3 pH when encountering a fairly wide range of pH. This pH stability allows slightly different proteins to moveto separate areas within the gel. Ampholytes may consist of several buffers combined together. Many carrierampholytes are based on aliphatic polyamines reacted with sulfo, phospho, and carboxyl groups. Below MaterialsThe electrophoresis pertormed laboratory run on a horizontal agarose gel slab. Agarose. agel derived from seaweed, is the easiest gel to formulate and still obtain effective results. Also, polyacrylamidegels, although often used industrially, are highly neurotoxic and not safe for beginning students. Agarose gelsalso have larger pore sizes than polyacrylamide gels. and therefore the electrophoretic process is accomplishedmuch more rapidly. The proteins to be analyzed are lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes (LDH).Lactic Dehydrogenase Isoenzymeslsoenzymes are similar enzymes which can catalyze the same reaction but which have different physi-cal properties and react differently in an electrical field. Human isoenzymes which have been studied inconjunction with disease creatine kinase. and alkaline phosphatase. These iso-enzymes are found in tissues throughout the human body but are more concentrated in some tissues thanin others. .Lactic dehydrogenase is a tetrameric enzyme (a molecule consisting of four structural subunits or peptidechains), but only two distinct subunit origins have been found. These two subunits are configured five diffe.tmtways in humans. The five types of human LDH are found primarily in the myocardium of the heart, red bloodcells, the brain, the kidney and liver, and in skeletal muscle.Medical researchers have developed keen interest in the levels of lactic dehydrogenase and creatine kinasein people who have suffered heart attacks. The levels of both isoenzymes increase sharply after an attack, andelevated lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) activity can be demonstrated for more than two weeks later. LDH isoen-zynie levels can be traced in the blood by electrophoretic isoelectric focusing on agarose gels. Creatine kinaseis released immediately after cellular damage to the heart, but LDH release lags by 1 - 2 days. Normallydoctors can identify what type of heart attack occturod 17,!1 identifying the amount and the type of LDH whichis predominant.Infarctions. secondary liver congestion, and other complications of a heart attack can be monitored throughelectrophoresis of the five LDH types. LDH increases also can be observed in progressive muscular dystrophy.liver diseases such as infectious hepatitis, leukemia, certain anemias, and in renal disease. Although it is knownthat these isoenzyme increases occur, it is still not known exactly why they occur or what these ^hemical changesreveal about bodily mechanisms. 104114 Monitoring LDH Activity it is possible to incubate LDH electrophoresed gels in a medium which promotes a dyeingreaction in the area of 1_DH activity, thereby allowing simple visual inspection of the results. The followingset of reactions can be obtained by incubation of LDH electrophoresed gels (these reactions will be Lactate + NADLDH> which is very brightly colored and insoluble.It deposits on the gel in the areas of high LDH activity, thereby allowing the student to visually scan the slabfor evidence of positive experimental results.ProcessDuring this laboratory the student will determine the characteristic electrophoretic patterns of lactic de-hydrogenase isoenzymes and also separate and identify the components of these isoenzymes using the elec-trophoretic technique of horizontal isoelectric focusing.Pre-labSupplies needed for gel electrophoresis. electrophoresis or microwave10 ml. pipetsglass tube or rollerlarge test tubehair dryer or other hot air sourceplastic trayMaterialstest tubes50\u00b0 C. water bath250 ml. graduated cylinder50\" C. ovenrefrigeratorscissors37\u00b0 incubator The enzyme, buffers, gel, and stains for this laboratory must at 0\u00b0 papersorbitolsalt solution (dilute)Some of these materials must be prepared in advance, and some can be ordered only from a limited num-ber of suppliers. 105115 Special Preparations 1)Electrophoresis units: agarose gel may be used on both horizontal and vertical electrophoresis units,but this laboratory is designed for a less expensive horizontal unit. Each student group will need one unit.Power supplies which can run multiple slab units are available.2) LDH isoenzyme kits: LDH For example.Sigma kit #705-G has sufficient materials for five student groups, including agarose gel. buffers. and stains.On the other hand, the teacher may prefer preparing many of these materials, as follows:3)Do not forget, all kits, enzymes, buffers, and stains must be stored in a refrigerator set at 0\u00b0 to 5\u00b0 C.4) Purchase lactic dehydrogenase isoenzymes.

Time Required:The gel electrophoresis laboratory requires three classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discus-sion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the following: casting stand, glass plates. clamps, water baths, oven, refrigerator. graduatedcylinder. pipet. large test tube, absorbent paper. electrophoresis film. 10% and LDH kits (or agarose,sorbitol. ampholyte. and distilled water).During this first hour students will set up the apparatus upon which the experiment is to be run and gainfamiliarity with electrophoresis equipment and techniques.StepsA. Melt the agarose solution in the LDH kit in a boiling water bath or microwave. following directions inthe kit. If kits are not available, make a solution of 1.0 gram agarose. 12.0 grams sorbitol. and enough distilledwater to make 100 ml. solution. Hold the solution in a 50\" C. water bath.B.Fill a 250 ml. graduated cylinder with distilled water and a 10 ml. pipet. and place it in the same waterbath. Also place a large test tube in the 50\" C. water bath. Keep the glassware in the bath until used.C. Lay one of the glass plates on a flat surface. Squirt a line of 10% glycerol up the center of the plate.D. Cut a 12 x 13 cm. piece of electrophoresis film. Hold the film by its 12 cm. edges with the gel bindingside facing you (the gel binding side will be on the inside of the roll).E. Place the center of the film. the side opposite the gel binding side. on the plate to which you haveapplied a line of glycerol. and fold down the edges. taking care that no air bubbles are trapped. The bottomedge of the film should be 1- 2 mm. from the bottom edge of the plate, and the sides equidistant from thesides of the plate. 106 F. Place absorbent paper over the plate and roll with a roller or glass tube. This will bond the film to theglass and remove excess glycerol solution from behind the film.G. Place the spacers along the 16 cm. edges of the glass plates. If the spacers cover any of the film. reposi-tion the film so that it is located between the spacers.H. Place the second plate over the spacers and clamp the whole thing together, taking care that the clampsare properly aligned. This is called the \"sandwich' Cam the sandwich to the casting stand and place it all ina 50\u00b0 C. oven. Leave in oven until step-J. I.Pipet the correct amount of ampholyte (in kits sometimes labeled as agarose buffer) and agarosesolution into the test tube. The correct amounts depend on the size spacers used. If the gel thickness is tobe 0.5 mm.. add 0.63 ml. ampholyte and 10 ml. agarose solution. If the gel thickness is to be 0.75 mm., add0.94 ml. ampholyte and 15 ml. agarose solution. In both cases the ampholyte will be 40% of the solutionvolume. Mix.J.Remove the casting stand and sandwich from the oven and quickly pipet the agarose/ampholytemixture into the sandwich.K. Allow the sandwich to come to room temperature and then place the assembly in the refrigerator over-night. or until performing the second hour of the procedure.

LDHkit (or NAD and solutions A and B). and scissors.In this hour you will electrophorese the gel.StepsA. Open the glass sandwich. Lift the film with gel off the glass plate. The gel should remain stuck to theplastic film; if it does not, repeat hour one. Trim approximately 3 mm. from all four edges of the film so thatthe gel thickness on the remaining film is uniform.B. Position the film. with gel side up. on the running surface of the electrophoresis unit. Adjust the tem-perature of the unit to 10\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 C.C. Load the LDH isoenzyme samples onto the middle of the gel. If using a kit, follow the directions. Other-wise, use freeze dried LDH isoenzyme. 0.5 ml., which has been dissolved in distilled water, 2.5 ml. Pipet onedrop of the solution onto thin paper or filter paper: carefully cut out the wet dot 'and place it on to the 'gel.Repeat five times so that a row of five dots runs down the middle of the gel parallel to where the electrodeswill be placed.D Place the surface electrodes directly on the surface of the gel. Assure that the wires run on the gelabout 3 mm. from the edges. Directions for th:, portion of the procedure might vary depending upon the brandof gel electrophoresis unit. Read the manufacturer's directions.E. Place small triangles of blotter paper under the electrodes at the points where the wires come off theedges of the gel. Position the triangles so that a tip extends away from the gel. These \"wicks\" will absorb liquidas it accumulates at each electrode and carry it away from the gel. 107 F.Run the gel at 15\u00b0 C. at 5 watts and 200 volts for 5 minutes. Then increase the voltage to 1000for 10 minutes. If pools of liquid appear on the surface of the gel while it is running, turn the power supplyoff and lightly blot the liquid from the surface of the gel. After a total running time of 15 minutes, turnthe power supply off and remove the paper dots. Continue the run for another 10 minutes at 5 watts and1000 volts. 1.It is during the run at 200 volts that the ampholytes arrange themselves according to the pH they buffer.During operation at 1000 volts what happens to the LDH protein.' G. While the 'gel is running, pour solutions A and B and NAD into a plastic tray, per the followingproportions. For every 36 ml. of solution A, use 1 ml. of solution B. Add 4 mg. NAD (nicotinamide adeninedinucleotide) for every 37 ml. of solutions A and B.H. When the gel has been electrophoresed, carefully turn the power off and remove the gel. Do not removethe plastic film backing or disturb the gel. Carefully place it in the plastic tray with solutions.

LaboratoryCells When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Demonstrate the proper use of a compound microscope.2.Explain how a prokaryotic cell differs from a eukaryotic cell.3.List structures found in unicellular organisms that are notusually found in multicellular organismal cells.4.Describe the structures of both a typical plant and a typicalanimal cell as seen with a light microscope.5.Describe specialized adaptations found in multicellularorganismal cells. The MicroscopeScientific advances often have been achieved by the development of instruments capable of extendingthe range of observation. The light microscope is one such instrument, and its development engineered amajor change in the biological sciences by opening up the world of cells. In this laboratory you will be introducedto this world.The human eye is unable to detect objects with a diameter less than approximately 0.004 inch, or 0.1millimeter. The very existence of cells was unknown until invention of the microscope at the beginning ofthe seventeenth century. Early microscopes were of two kinds. The first contained a single lens of very shortfocal length. Such instruments are similar to magnifying glasses, which have been known since antiquity. Thesecond was the compound microscope, with a double lens system consisting of an ocular and objective andcapable of far greater power of magnification. All contemporary light microscopes are of the compound type.There are many variations possible on a basic compound microscope. A typical one might appear as below:Eyepiece Coarse Adjustment Knob Fine Adjustment Knob ArmRevolving Nosepiece Objective LensStageCondenserLight SourceBase(Figure 1 1131 23 Many variations on the compound microscope are possible. The eyepiece can be monocular or binocular,there can be several objectives of varying powers of focus, the light source can be a simple mirror or electricbulb. etc. One can design a light microscope for use with polarized light, dark field fluorescence, phase contrast,and a number of other types of microscopy that show some cell components very clearly. Oil immersion micro-scopes have a special objective which can be used by placing a drop of oil on the slide; it increases the magnifi-cation of the microscope as the objective pulls the oil upwards by surface tension.Still other variations include changes to the stage of the microscope so that it can hold dishes of organisms.At low power enlargement these stage-varied instruments are simple dissecting microscopes. When designedfor high power enlargement Of individual cell cultures. they become complex and expensive inverted micro-scopes. Additionally, any light microscope can be designed to hold cameras and other attachments.The Electron MicroscopeIt was not until invention of the electron microscope after WWII that there was a significant breakthroughin microscope technology. Rather than using light, as in the compound microscope. the electron microscopeuses a beam of electrons emitted by a tungsten filament to form an image of the specimen: The glass lensesof the light microscope are replaced by electric fields. and the image is viewed on a fluorescent screen. Sincethe electrons will form a coherent beam only when traveling in a vacuum, it is not possible to introduce livingcells into the column of an electron microscope. The resolving power of the electron microscope is much greaterthan that of the light microscope. The electron microscope is capable of magnifications as high as 160,000times. The micrographs taken with the electron microscope may be further enlarged photographically to achievemagnifications in excess of 1.000,000.Pre-labSupplies needed paperimmersion oilEuglena, living culturecotton ballsintestine, a leaf in cross section. and the three bacterial typesSpecial Preparations1) Paramecium:aerate the culture upon arrival and store in subdued lighting at 60 70\u00b0 F. Parameciumcultures are usually very concentrated and easy to subculture. For short time storage add one wheat grain toeach jar ofParamecium.2) Euglena: also aerate upon receipt and keep at 60 - 70\u00b0 F. However. place in sunshine or other bright light.3) Put the stains and other chemicals in dropper bottles for ease of use. 114 1 :2 4 4) 45% acetocarmine: add 45 ml. glacial acetic acid to 55 ml. distilled water in a graduated cylinder. Add0.5 g. carmine and boil 3 minutes. Cool, filter, and place in stock bottle. Dilute one part of the stock with twoparts 45% acetic acid before use..5) Methylene blue: dissolve 1.6 methylene blue in 100 ml. 95% ethanol. Dilute (1:10) 10 ml. of themixture with 90 ml. distilled water before use.6) Methyl cellulose: use protoslo. or 10% methyl cellulose. In the latter case, mix 10 g. methyl cellulosewith 90 ml. distilled water and allow the solution to mix on a magnetic stirrer until the cellulose is completelydissolved and the viscosity uniform.7) Congo red stained yeast cells: add 1 g. yeast cells to 20 ml. distilled water. Boil 5 minutes. Add a tooth-pick full of congo red and stir. Allow 15 minutes for the dye to penetrate into the yeast cells. Refrigerate untilready for use. Do not keep more than two days because the suspension spoils rapidly.8) Leaves: literally any thin leaf type will do. Elodea or Anacharis leaves are fine if a fish tank is handy:lettuce or Italian (flat) parsley works perfectly well also.Time Required:The cells laboratory requires three classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the listed equipment, as well as the following materials: cottage cheese or yogurt, tooth-picks. crystal violet, immersion oil. and prepared slides of the three bacterial types.Prokaryotic CellsDuring hour one students will view the simplest cells of all, prokaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells belong tothe kingdom Monera. which comprises both the bacteria and the blue-green algae. Prokaryotes lack the organellesof true cells the eukaryotes. The DNA of a prokaryote exists as a single. naked molecule floating in the cytoplasmof the cell. Prokaryotes contain ribosomes, but the ribosomes float in the cytoplasm, or clump together in groupsknown as polysomes. All members of the kingdom Monera have cell walls, and many have special structuresfor movement, such as long, whip-like flagella. Prokaryotic cytoplasm may include capsules, gas vacuoles,and other inclusion bodies. Many contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis.In the kingdom Monera the bacteria belong to the division Schizomycetaceae (which means \"fission fungi \").Bacteria are spread universally and consist of almost numberless species.In this laboratory hour you will study three different types of bacteria. Because it is difficult to ascertainstructural differences among bacteria, bacteria are classically grouped according to morphology shape.stainability, and flagellation. Further, since the early nineteenth century, three basic shapes have been usedto describe bacteriaround, rod, and spiral.Fermentation of Dairy ProductsFermentation has been used since the dawn of civilizafion as a mechanism to prevent dairy productsfrom spoiling. The general procedure is to introduce microorganisms which Convert the milk sugar, lactose.into lactic acid. This results in a pH drop and the formation of curd due to the coagulation of casein. Thelower pH prevents the growth of unfavorable bacteria which would make the dairy product unfit for humanconsumption. The bacteria responsible for yogurt or cottage cheese formation are Lactobacillus bulgaricus andStreptococcus lactis. 115,Mr StepsA. Clean a glass slide by washing it and then dipping it in acetone or 95% ethanol. Air dry. Do not touchthe slide after cleaning. Note: this step is very important, unless you are using new slides, because bacteriaare very tiny organisms which are easy to confuse with background dust and other contaminants.B. Place a tiny sample of yogurt or cottage cheese on your microscope slide, using the end of a toothpick.Add a small drop of tap water and stir with the toothpick to spread out the cells. Add a coverslip and placeon the microscope stage.C. Focus the microscope on the slide using low power, and then switch to high power. If your microscopehas an oil immersion lens, add a drop of immersion oil to the slide and vit.N the bacteria under oil immersion.1. The swarms of rod shaped organisms that you see are cells of Lactobacillus. Streptococcus bacteria areround shaped. and they might also be in your microscopic field of view. Can you see any structure withinthe cells of either type of bacteria? If so. what? 2. What organelle is found in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells? 3. Do you see any movement? If so, how would you describe it D. Repeat steps A and B above, but do not add a coverslip to the slide. Instead, allow the smear to drycompletely.E. Drip xylene on the slide for 2 3 minutes to extract any fat present in the smear. This is best accomplishedby holding the slide at an angle and slowly running the chemical over the smear drop by drop using a medicinedropper or small pipet. F.Drip 95% ethanol on the slide for 1 2 minutes to fix the bacteria in the smear.G. Drip methylene blue solution on the slide for 1 minute.H. Drop 95% ethanol on the slide for 1 minute. or until the slide is only faintly blue.IRinse the slide by dropping tap water on it until the slide no longer stains the wash water.J.Allov, the slide to air dry and, without a coverslip. examine it under low and high power.4. Does the methylene blue solution make a difference in the way you see the bacteria. If so. how? K Look at your own oral bacteria r Ise a clean toothpick to scrape some of the tartar from between yourteeth. Smear the scum on th, microscope slide with the toothpick. Pass the slide over the small flame of analcohol lamp or bunsen burner to \"fix\" the cells onto the slide.L. Add a drop of crystal violet stain and wait 1 minute.M. Drip tap water on the slide until the slide is only faintly purple. about 1 minute. Air dry the slide. 116 N. You may view this slide of bacteria from your mouth under the microscope, either with or without acoverslip. If you use a coverslip, add a drop of water to the slide before adding the coverslip.5. The bacteria are tiny and darkly stained. They may be round, rod, or spiral shaped, and some may appearin clumps. Choose several different types noted on the slide, and draw the bacteria types that you see in thespace provided below. Label them as to shape and grouping (if any). 0. View under both low and high power the three types of bacteria shown on the prepared slides.6. Draw the three types in the space provided below and label them as to shape. .1.:.(117 Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following: Paramecium, Euglena, congo red stained yeast cells, methyl cellulose or protoslo, lens paper, and toothpicks.The KingdomProtistaThe kingdom Protista contains microorganisms whose specialized intracellular organelles permit T far widerrange of activ ties than the more primitive, prokaryotic Monera. Protista capabilities range from species whichare animal -like hunters of food to plant-like photosynthesizers. Still others are fungus-like in that they feed onorganic detritus. Although diverse, all Protista are unicellular eukaryotes.There observe during this hour a plant-likefla^ellate, the Euglena, and an animal-like ciliate, the Paramecium.StepsA. Place a small drop of the Euglena culture on a clean slide and add a drop of methyl cellulose. or protoslo.Stir the drop with a toothpick and add a covcrslip.B. View the slide under low power until you can identify the Euglena, and then switch to high power.7. Approximately how large is your specimen? \u00b5m.8. Note the swimming action of Euglena. Euglena have two flagella and the one used for locomot!un is visibleunder the microscope. Can you see the locomotive flagellum?9. Look for the eyespot (stigma) and contractile vacuole near the base of the flagella. What color is the eyespot,and what is its function? C. Note other parts of the Euglena. Near me center of the c^11 you will find a single nucleus ere arealso chloroplasts. Each chloroplast may contain a single py,-;moid, which will appear as a clear, round areawithin the plastid. These pyrenoids may be associated with paramylon synthesis. Paromylon, the carbohydratestorage product unique to these microorganisms, appear as many refractive granules of variou , shapes andsizes with,\" the cytoplasm.10. Draw a Euglena in the space provided below, labeling all parts. 1181;18 D. Note the numerous, helically arranged striations which appear near the surface of Euglena, immedi-ately beneath the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane and the striations together constitute the pellicle.11. Why is the pellicle not considered to be a cell wall? 12. Phototaxis is a directional movement in response to light. Note the movement of the Euglena in responseto the light of your microscope. Are Euglena negatively (moving away from light) or positively (moving towardlight) phototactic?13. What is the adap':significance of this behavior? E. Place a small drop of the Paramecium culture on a clean slide and add a drop of methyl cellulose,or protoslo. Add a minute amount of congo red dyed yeast cells by using a toothpick. Gently mix the dropwith the toothpick and add a coverslip.F. View the slide under low power until you can identify the Paramecium's gross structures, and thenswitch to high power.14. Approximately how large is the specimen?G. As the Paramecium rotates, identify the oral groove. Cilia lining the groove create currents which sweepfood (in this case congo red dyed yeast cells) into the gullet, where food vacuoles are formed. Find a Parameciumwhich has ingested some yeast cells.15. Where are the yeast cells found inside the Paramecium') 16. Focus with the high power objective of your microscope on one yeast cell being digested. What color arethe yeast cells when they are inside the Paramecium?17. What factor might be affecting the color of the dye? H. Use the high power objective to look closely at the contractile ve uole. You should see its radiating:hannels collect and then transfer excess water to the vacuole, which then drops the water out of the Parameciumthrough a modified area on the pellicle, or cell covering.18. Do you see beating cilia on the pellicle of the Paramecium?19. As the Paramecium becomes irritated by heat from the microscope light, or by the weight of the coverslipas its \"pond\" evaporates, it may discharge trichocysts These will appear as fuzzy threads just on the outsideof the pellicle. Are Paramecia positively or negatively phototactic? Why? 119:2 Procedure: Hour 3Students need all listed equipment, as well as the following materials: leaves, razor blade, lens paper, sterilelancets, cotton balls, 70% alcohol, microscope slides and coverslips, and prepared slides of the human intestineand the cross section of a leaf.The kingdoms Plantae and Animalia are comprised of multicellular plants and animals. Plants primarilyphotosynthesize for energy, and animals feed off plants and other animals. Their cells are interdependent andspecialized to perform certain tasks on behalf of the entire organism.You will observe examples of cells as they function in both plants and animals in this laboratory hour.StepsA. Slice a very thin cross section off a small sample of the leaves provided by the instrt.ctor. Carefullylay the slide on a microscope slide then cover with a drop of water and a coverslip.B. Examine the leaf section first under the low power objective and then under the high power objective.If the cross section is not thin enough to see individual cells, step A should be repeated. Focus on a clear andorderly group of cells (a cell group which has not been disturbed by slicing during slide preparation).20. How many different types of cells do you see?21. Choose a representative cell from each cell type in your field of vision, and draw each cell in the spaceprovided below. Label all cell structures you are able to identify. 22. Do all the cell types possess chloroplasts? If not, where do those cells which do not havc chloroplastsobtain their energy to live? C. Observe the prepared slide of a cross section of a leaf under both the low and high power objectives.23. Does the prepared slide differ from your own slide of a leaf cross section? How? 12013 D. Sterilize the end of your ring finger by wiping it with cotton soaked in alcohol. Prick your finger w:4ha sterile lancet. Place a drop of your blood on a clean slide and cover with a cover slip. Wipe your finger againwith the alcohol soaked cotton to prevent infection.E. View the slide of your blood under low and then high power objectives.24. How many types of blood cells do you see?25. Choose a representative cell from each of the cell types you see, and draw each type in the space providedbelow. Label all cell structures that you observe. 26.

LaboratoryBacterial Staining Procedures When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Demonstrate proper staining techniques for bacteria onsolid or liquid staining, staining, spore staining,and acid fast staining of bacteria. PurposeBacteria are stained to demonstrate the morphological characteristics of the organism and to show the presenceand location of biochemical constituents. No single stain will demonstrate all the known elements of the bac-terial cell. As a result, special staining techniques have been developed for such parts as the capsule, cell wall.spores. and flagella. Still different staining techniques are commonly used for components such as fats, carbo-hydrates, and nucleic acids, and the application of histochemical techniques is continually expanding. For pur-poses of introduction, only four types of stains are described in this laboratory the simple, the gram, thespore, and the acid fast stain.This laboratory is a procedural exercise designed to introduce the student to techniques employed in micro-biology laboratories. The student also will find that these procedures are used in subsequent laboratories inthis manual.Pre-labSupplies needed:Equipmentmicroscope,staining bar (optional) inoculating slipsother heat source400 ml. beaker and ring stand, or any other set up to make a boiling water bath.Materialsmethylene blue95% ethanolsafran inacid alcoholSpecial Preparations1) Methyl two days before use.90 ml. distilled water.

Many of the problems encountered in microbiological laboratory procedure are due tocontamination. Microorganisms exist everywhere, on the surface of all objects. and in the air. A conscious effortmust be made to keep them out of a sterile environment. Here are some important precautions to take duringall microbiological procedures.1) Use only sterilized glassware or disposable plastic ware.2) Wipe the work area with 70% alcohol before starting. Also rinse your hands with alcohol (use handlotion at the end of the laboratory to counteract the dryng effects of the alcohol).3) Be careful not to talk, sing, or whistle when performing these procedures. Your breath can create aircurrents which carry contaminants into the culture.4) Never uncover any sterile surface until the moment before it is to be used. Return the cover as soonas you are finished. Never leave it open to the environment.5) When removing the cap fr Dm a bottle, flask test tube. etc.. angle the container as far as possible toreduce the surface of the opening into which microorganisms can fall. Do not hold the opening straight upinto the air.6) When transferring bacterial cells use the following procedure:a) Introduce the cells (inoculum) into a sterilized medium by transferring with an inoculating loop orneedle. Heat the inoculating loop or needle to redness by flaming immediately before and after making thetransfer. This flaming destroys any living forms on the surface of the loop or needle.b) Grasp and hold the cap or cotton plug of the bottle, flask, or test tube with your little finger. Donot place the cap or cotton plug on the laboratory bench.c) Immec:ately flame the mouths of the tubes from which cultures are taken and into which they aretransferred, both before and after transfer. In addition to destroying any organisms on the lip of the tube, flamingtends to create outward convection currents. thus decreasing the chance of contamination. 126137 (d)If you are transferring cells from petri plates, you cannot flame the lips of the plates. Instead, youhold the lid of the plate at an angle over the plate to avoid air-borne contamination. This technique is illustratedas follows in figure one. Inoculating Loop Petri PlateFigure 1Solid Media ProcedureBacteria found growing naturally may be cultured on solid media in the laboratory. Bacteria on solid mediagrow from a few cells to a mass of daughter cells.whichcan become visible to the naked eye. Such a cell clusteris called a colony.The surface of colonies may be classified as smooth. rough. dry. moist, or pigmented. The following diagramsrepresent typical bacterial colony shapes. You will find these descriptions and diagrams useful in gross bacterialclassification.Surface Colony Shapes:Circular Colonies:FlatRaised I Convex Umbonate Figure 2..An easy way to make a solid medium is to add a solidifying agent to a broth medium which will hardenas it cools. The broth contains nutrients dissolved in water, with the mix varied according to the bacteria tobe cultured. Usually the solidifying agent is agar. a substance obtained from marine algae and available in dried.purified form. Although different agars vary widely in their physical properties. the usual melting point is 97100\u00b0 C. Thus agar may be liquified for use by boiling. On cooling. media containing agar solidify at about42\u00b0 C. If they are to be inoculated before hardening, they are usually cooled to 45 47\u00b0 C., a temperaturethat is not harmful to most bacteria for short periods of time. Once solidified. agar media may be incubatedover the entire range of temperatures up to 70\u00b0 C. without melting.Besides petri plates. the most commonly used agar medium, agar slants and stabs are two standard solidmedia methods for culturing bacteria. An agar stab is simply broth and agar which have been hardened ina test tube. The tube is capped with a loose plastic cap or cotton plug. An agar slant also is hardened in atest tube, but the mixture is allowed to harden on a slant so it has the maximum surface area exposed insideUmbilicate 127133 the test tube. It is inoculated with an inoculating loop and bacteria and is capped in a manner similar to anagar stab. It is not as easy to see typical colonial growth on slants and stabs as with bacteria grown on petriplates, but they are convenient and space saving methods for maintaining stock cultures.Agar is a galactan. a complex carbohydrate composed of galactose molecules which are not subject tobreakdown by most bacteria. It is not a food source, and therefore the medium must contain a nutrient supplyfor the bacteria. Other hardening agents used for special purposes include gelatin and silica gel.The procedure for transferring bacteria grown on solid media is as follows:1) Place a small drop of tap water on a clean glass slide. Using aseptic technique. remove a sample oforganisms from the colony and emulsify in the drop of water until the drop is faintly turbid. Spread over anarea approximately the size of a dime and allow to air dry.2) When the smear is completely dry. heat fix it by passing the slide quickly. smear side up. through aflame two or three times. The slide should feel barely warm to the back of your hand. Excessive heating willdistort the organisms.Liquid Media ProcedureBacteria also can be found in nature in liquid media. In the laboratory bacteria can be grown in a test tubein a liquid broth medium. There are many recipes for good broths, depending on the type of bacteria to begrown. All liquid media must provide the proper physical and chemical environment and nutrient substancesin water solution.Broth solutions may be affected in different ways by the growth of bacteria. You will find these descriptionsconvenient when attempting to describe and/or classify bacteria.1) Turbidity: a cloudiness, more or less dense.2) Pellicle formation: a small mass of cells floating on top of the broth.3) Sediment: a deposit of cells resting at the bottom of the broth culture which will swirl up if the tubeis tapped gently.The procedure for transferring bacteria grown in liquid media is as follows:1) Place a loopful of liquid containing the organism on a clean glass slide, using aseptic technique. Spreadover a dime sized area and allow to air dry.2) When the smear is completely dry, heat fix it by passing the slide quickly. smear side up, through aflame two or three times. The slide should feel barely warm to the back of your hand. Excessive heating willdistort the organisms.Simple StainingSimple staining is possible because of the chemical differences which exist between bacterial cells and theirsurroundings. Cells will absorb a selected stain differently from their medium and the contrast between the cells andtheir environment can be shown. Methylene blue is one such simple and basic dye, formula C161-I18C1N,S -31-120,which is especially useful for staining bacteria and nuclear material from eukaryotic cells. Methylene blue also is anoxidation reduction indicator, because it has two forms, a blue form and a colorless form, with the colorless formappearing in acidic mixtures. Incidentally. methylene blue also is used as an antidote for cyanide poisoning.In this laboratory hour you will stain your own saliva (a personal bacterial source in liquid medium) withmethylene blue.StepsA. Prepare a smear of your spit on a clean glass slide. Do not stick a hot inoculating loop in your mouth.Let the loop air cool before placing in your mouth to collect saliva. Air dry and fix with heat, followingthe instructions given earlier. 128139 B. Apply a drop of methylene blue stain to the slide smear. Let sit for a period of two minutes.C. Gently wash off stain with droppers of tap water, air dry the slide, and examine with the microscopeunder high power or under oil immersion.1. Draw in the space provided below what you see on your slide. 2. How many different bacterial shapes do you see' Of the three basic bacterial shapes (discussedin laboratory twelve) which ones .are living in your mouth'sCocci. or round bacteria. are further classified according to the way the cells divide. Some cocci dividein one plane only and form chains of cocci called Streptococcus.Some cocci divide in any plane and formirregular clumps of cells called Staphlyococcus.Some cocci divide in two and stick togethr: the double cellsare called Diplococcus. Some cocci divide in three planes at right angles to each other forming packets of-eight: these are calledSarcina.3. Do you see any cell groupings on your stained slide? You may well see groupings that have not been describedabove. What are these? D. Your instructor will give you a contaminated petri plate. Make a smear slide from this petri plate. usingaseptic technique and the procedures for bacteria grown on solid medium.4. Draw in the space provided below what you see on this slide. Procedure: Hour 2 .Students need all listed equipment, and the following materials: crystal violet, Gram's iodine, 95% ethanol.and safranin.The Gram StainThe gram stain is a type of differential stain, a staining procedure based on the physical and chemicaldifferences which exist between species of bacteria, in additon to the cell-medium difference exploited in simplestaining. Differential stains require two or more dyes to develop the contrasts being sought.The gram stain was named for its developer. Christian Gram, who used it while working on the etiologyof respiratory diseases at the Municipal Hospital in Berlin in 1883 1884. The gram staining procedure todayis used by bacteriologists more than any other staining technique. It is indispensible for the identification ofunknown organisms. and it is of great importance in the diagnosis of infectious diseases such as gonorrhea.meningitis. and pneumonia.The gram stain requires four different solutions: a basic dye. a mordant, a decolorizing agent, and acounter-stain.DyesDyes may be divided into two groups. basic and acidic. If the color resides in the positive ion of the dye.it is called a basic dye. or stain. Methylene blue and crystal violet are both basic dyes. If the color resides inthe negatively charged ion, it is called an acidic dye. or stain.MordantsA mordant is a substance which increases the affinity or attraction between the cell and the dye It helpsfix, or. more strongly stain the dye on the cell. Examples of mordants are acids, bases, metallic salts. and iodine.A mordant also makes it more difficult to wash the dye out of the cell after staining. Iodine acts :is the mordantin the gram staining procedure.DecolorizersA decolorizing agent is a substance which removes the dye from a stained cell. Some stained cells decolorizemore easily than others. The gram stain capitalizes on this phenomenon by taking advantage of variations inthe rate of decolorization in bacterial cells. Ninety-five percent ethanol is used as the decolorizing agent in thislaboratory exercise.Bacterial cell walls which tend to retain the dye in spite of the application of a decolorizing agent are calledgram positive bacteria. Bacterial cell walls which lose the dye are called gram negative organisms. It is believedthat the cell walls of the two types of bacteria are structured differently, the gram positive bacteria having thickercell walls but the gram negative bacteria having an additional outer covering of some material chemically differentfrom any thing found in the gram positive organism.Counter-stainsThe counter-stain is a basic dye of a different color from the initial dye. The purpose of the counter-stainis to give the decolorized cells a cclor different from that of the initial stain. Those organisms that are not readilydecolorized retain the color of the initial basic dye. and those that are readily decolorized take the color ofthe counter-stain. Safranin will be used as the counter-stain in this laboratory exercise.You will practice the gram staining procedure on your own oral bacteria.StepsA. Prepare a smear of your spit on a clean glass slide, air dry, and fix with heat following the instructionson aseptic technique given earlier in this laboratory. Do not stick a hot inoculating loop in your mouth. Let it air cool before using.B. Apply crystal violet to the heat fixed smear for exactly one minute. Timing is very important. 1301 '1 1 C.ash with water, drop by drop, until colored water no loiier -urs off the stained slide.D. Rinse with Gram's iodine solution.

Show your slide to your instructor.5. Draw in the space provided below what you see on your slide. Color bacteria blue if they are gram positive,and pink if they are gram negative. 6. What would happen if cells were first stained with crystal violet, then treated with Gram's iodine, and then,without decolorization, exposed to safranin2 7. Can you tentatively identify any of the bacterial organisms in your spit? If so. what might .they be? Procedure: Hour 3Students need all the equipment listed, and the following materials: carbol fuchsin. boiling water bath.95% ethanol, methylene blue. and acid alcohol.During this hour you will do both the spore stain and the acid fast stain. Both are differential stainingprocedures.The Spore StainThe spore stain demonstrates the presence of bacteria, spore:, Among eubacteria (true bacteria) the abilityto form endospores is a relatively rare ahlity. Endosporz formation adds considerably to the survival abilitiesof bacteria, and those with the ability to form endospores must be considered to be a special physiologicalgroup among the eubacteria. 1310-a- .1 4. All known spore formers are rod shaped bacilli, with the exception of Sporosarcina ureae,which is a coccus.Most are motile and gram positive, although as a colony ages they can become gram negative or gram variable.The spores are most simply observed as intracellular refractile bodies in unstained cells, or as colorless areasin cells fixed with a simple stain.Some spore formers are pathogenic for insects or for higher animals. and their characteristic habitat is thesoil. There are three genera of spore formers, Clostridiumwhich are strict anaerobes. Many Bacilliproducedisease in man and animals, such as B. causative agent of anthrax. Some Clostridia,such asC. tetani, arethe principal agents of wound infection. Others are powerful toxin producers in canned foods.The spore wall of such bacteria is relatively impermeable to staining. but dyes can be made to penetrateit by heating the preparation. The same impermeability then serves to prevent decolorization of the spore throughsuch procedures as the alcohol treatment employed during hour two. Other structures are then counter-stainedfor easy identification. Spores are commonly stained with carbol fuchsin.The Acid. Fast StainThe earliest differential stain was a procedure developed by Robert Koch during his original work ontuberculosis in 1881. He used what is now termed the acid fast stain to differentiate between Mycobacterium,the bacterium which causes human tuberculosis. and the tissue cells and other microorganisms taken as samplesfrom tubercular patients.The acid fast stain, also known as the Ziel-Neelsen procedure, is of great diagnostic value in the detectionand identification of mycobacteria. Mycobacteria means \"fungus-bacteria', and they are a special group of bacteriawhich grow in a rudimentary fungus-like fashion (in strands of cells) before breaking up into irregular. oftenbranched rods. The genusMycobacteriumcontains several species that are pathogenic to man and othervertebrates, such asMycobacterium tuberculosis.There are also many nonpathogenic soil dwelling species.Mycobacterial cells contain waxy materials which make them difficult to stain with basic aniline dyes, suchas carbol fuchsin. Mycobacteria do take a stain if it is applied as a hot solution, but once the stain has penetratedthe cell walls, it is extremely difficult to remove. In fact, mycobacteria even resist destaining with a mixtureof hydrochloric acid and alcohol. The cells of other bacteria are readily destained with this strong mixture.In the acid fast stain procdure. a smear of cells on a slide is flooded with carbol fuchsin and heated on a steambath. Following this, decolorization with acid alcohol is carried out, and, finally, a contrasting (blue or green)counter-stain is applied. Acid fast bacteria appear red, while all other bacteria take on the color of the counter-stain.Further Precautions For the Acid Fast Staining ProcedureCertain precautions should be taken in the preparation of smears to be examined for acid fast organisms.1) Use only new, clean slides to avoid sample contamination by acid fast bacteria that may be found onused slides from previous positive stains.2) Use distilled water and reagents free of acid fast saprophytes and debris.3) Place smears of a uniform. medium thickness on the slide.4) Separate slides on staining bars, and add the stain with a dropper, being careful not to touch the slidewith the tip of the dropper. The stain should be fresh and deep red in color.5) Do not allow the stain to dry on .the slide; add stain as needed to maintain the film.6)If a free flame is used in heating the stain, great care must be taken to avoid boiling.7) Do not use a blotter to dry the slide. Acid fast bacteria may be present on blotting tissue and wouldbe transferred to the slide.8) Be certain that the lens of the microscope is clean and free of acid fast material from slides previouslyexamined. 132143 StepsA. Prepare two smears of your spit on two clean glass slides, air dry, and fix with heat following the instructionson aseptic technique given earlier in this laboratory. Do not stick a hot inoculating loop in your mouth.Let it air cool before using.B. Place the slides on staining bars over a cup of boiling water and flood both smea.-. with carbbl fuchsin.Keep the slides well flooded with stain and steam for at least 7 minutes. This can be messy, so be careful.The stains should be fresh and deep red in color.C. Thoroughly rinse off all excess stain in tap water.D. Test one slide for spores: Remember, timing is critical.1) Flood the slide with alcohol for 10 to 20 seconds and immediately rinse in water.2) Counter-stain for 30 seconds with methylene blue; wash, dry, and examine.8. What color are the vegetative structures in your slide?9. What color should the spores be in your slide?10. Draw some typical cells as they appear on your slide in the space provided below. Note their groupingand also their stained color. 11.If there were spore forming bacteria in your saliva, what might this signify? E. Test the other slide for acid fast bacteria.1) Flush all freely removeable stain from the entire slide with acid alcohol.2) Flood the entire smear with acid alcohol and allow it to stand for at least 10 minutes. It is impossibleto over destainMycobacterium tuberculosis.3) Wash with water.4) Counter-stain for 1 to 3 minutes with methylene blue.5) Wash with water.6) Let this slide dry thoroughly and examine under high power or with an oil immerison microscope. 1331 1 4 12.

LaboratoryIsolation of Pure Cultures from Mixtures of Bacteria When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Observe the morphology and motility of bacteria.2.Isolate pure cultures from mixtures of bacteria.3.Make a presumptive verification of a pure culture isolate.4.Inoculate stock cultures of bacteria. Pure Culture TechniquesIn order to study the properties of a bacterial species, it is necessary to work with that species in a pureculture, that is, in a culture free of all other types of bacteria. To do this, a single cell often is isolated fromother cells and cultivated so that its offspring remain isolated. This is called pure culture technique.Robert KochLess than one hundred years ago scientists thought that bacteria had the capacity to change their shapeand size, and perhaps even function, since bacteria were found naturally in mixed populations. Robert Koch,a German physician, demonstrated the error of this thinking through developing pure culture techniques. Kochcombined a medical practice with an extremely productive research career, for which he received the NobelPrize in 1905. Koch's award resulted from his interest in studying bacteria which cause certain diseases. Herecognized that it was necessary to have simple methods for obtaining pure cultures of target bacteria. Kochconcluded that the isolation of a pure culture required a solid medium on which an isolated single cell couldmultiply into a colony.Koch initially experimented with growing bacteria on the cut surfaces of potatoes, but he found that alack of particular nutrients prevented growth of some bacteria. Koch then decided that it would be advan-tageous to solidify a liquid nutrient designed for the growth of a particular bacteria. He eventually hit uponagar as the best hardening agent. His was the same procedure as that used today and described in laboratorythirteen.Bacterial IsolationKoch perfected two methods for isolating bacteria on agar. The first is the streaking method, in whichan inoculating loop of bacteria is lightly streaked over hardened agar and then incubated. The other is thepour plate method, in which bacteria are added to agar just before it hardens and then poured into a dishwhere the bacteria incubate. Koch's laboratory also designed the petri plate, a two part glass dish which canbe readily sterilized. It is named after the technician who developed it and remains unchanged to this day.There are many methods for obtaining pure cultures of bacteria. This laboratory is designed to duplicatesome of Robert Koch's original experiments in bacterial isolation. Students will also observe and record someof the distinguishing biochemical a:tivities of the Pre-labSupplies sterile petri platesbunsen burner nutrient (optional) Special Preparations 1)Set the incubator at 370 C.2) Make the crystal violet, Gram's iodine, and safranin according to the directions in laboratory thirteen.3) Kovac's reagent (also known as the indole ml. n-Amyl alcohol with 5.0 p-dimethylamine benzaldehyde.4)Nitrite test reagents.Solution A: dissolve 8 grams sulfanilic acid in 1 liter 5 Normal acetic acid (1 part glacial acetic acid to2.5 parts water).Solution B: dissolve 5 grams dimethyl-alpha-naphthylamine in 1 liter 5 Normal acetic acid.Do not mix solutions.5) All the following broths, ferments, blanks, and agar, as well as glassware containing them must besterile. If available. an autoclave is a very useful instrument for sterilization, since moist heat is a more efficientkilling agent than dry heat. and an autoclave uses supersaturated steam at a temperature of 121\" C. Autoclave(or pressure cook) all materials and glassware for 30 minutes at 121\u00b0 C. and 15 pounds per square inch pres-sure. This work should be done in advance of the actual laboratory. and: after cooling, the various test tubesand petri dishes may be refrigerated until the actual laboratory session.6) Ferments: dissolve 40 grams of each sugar glucose, lactose, maltose, and sucrose in 1 liter eachdistilled water. Add ten drops phenol red indicator (phenolsulfonphthalein) to each sugar-water mixture.Phenol red is suitable for use as a pH indicator, since at pH 6.8 it is yellow an.' at pH 8.2 it is red. Fill testtubes with 25 ml. of each sugar solution. 'Make one test tube of each type of sugar for each laboratory group.Label each test tube as to what type of sugar it contains. Add durham tubes to the test tubes, filling the tubeswith the sugar solution. Plug with rolled cotton wads and sterilize. 138110 7) Tryptone broth: make tubes of 1% tryptophane broth (such as Difco B123). Fill test tubes with25 ml. of the solution. Make one test tube for each laboratory group. Label the test tubes. Plug with rolledcotton wads and sterilize. Refrigerate.8)Nitrate broth (such as Difco B268): fill test tubes with 25 ml. of the solution. Make one test tube foreach laboratory group. Label the test tubes. Plug with rolled cotton wads and sterilize. Refrigerate.9)Sterile blanks: fill test tubes with 25 ml. distilled water. Make one test tube for each laboratory group.Label the test tubes. Plug with rolled cotton wads and sterilize. Refrigerate.10) Nutrient agar, or TSY (trypticase-soya-yeast) agar: either agar mixture may be used. Soften in distilledwater according to package directions, and heat, stirring, until disc )Ived. The exact proportions of agar towater vary depending on the type of agar. Fill test tubes with 25 rr agar solution. Make four test tubes foreach laboratory group. Label the test tubes. Plug with rolled cotton ..ads-and sterilize. Cool two of every fourtest tubes of agar on a slant (these are known as agar slants: the other two are known as agar deeps), andwhen they have hardened, refrigerate all four test tubes.11) Also make two agar petri plates per each laboratory group, using the agar preparation directions givenin 4'10 above. Fill each plate approximately half full of nutrient or TSY agar. Sterilize and allow the agar toharden. Transfer the agar petri plates to a refrigerator, and store in an inverted position until the laboratory.They are to be inverted so that moisture will not condense on the lids and drip into the agar.12) Gelatin deeps: dissolve nutrient broth in distilled water to which has been added 12 to 15% gelatin.Fill test tubes with 25 ml. of the solution. Make one test tube for each laboratory group. Label the test tubes.Plug with rolled cotton wads and sterilize. Refrigerate.13) Suspension containing two organisms: each student group should receive a different suspension con-taining two organisms unknown to them. These unknowns should be prepared, labeled by number, and in-cubated before the laboratory sessions. The instructor may wish to conduct this laboratory in one of two ways.If the instructor wishes the suspension to contain bacteria with obvious colonial color differences. thesuspension should contain two of the following bacteria, Escherichia coli, Sarcina lutea, and Serratia marescens.All are readily available from several suppliers.If the instructor wishes the unknown bacteria not to have color clues, the suspension can be selected fromthe following bacteria, Aerobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus albus, orStreptococcus zymogenes. Several of these are available from commercial sources. and the rest are availablefrom the American Type Culture Collection.Time RequiredThe isolation of Pure Cultures from Mixtures of Bacteria laboratory requires five classroom hours, inaddition to preparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need all equipment and the following materials: a suspension containing two organisms,and two nutrient agar or TSY plates.During this laboratory hour you will observe the morphology and motility of bacteria. You also will beginto isolate pure cultures from a mixture.StepsA. Gently mix the suspension of unknown bacteria by rolling the test tube in your hands.

While the agar plates are cooling, observe the colonies streaked during hour one of this laboratory.On the basis of your observations. select two well isolated colonies which appear to be representative of thetwo different organisms present. Make a gram stain of each to further determine that two different organismsare represented. Repeat the entire procedure, if necessary, until you are certain that each colony representsone and only one type of bacteria. and that the two colonies are composed of different bacteria. If there areno isolated colonies, repeat procedure, hour one, before proceeding with this laboratory.4. Observe the two bacterial types.

Label the slants of the two bacteria with the suspension number. date, bacterial type (shape and gramstain type), and student names or group name. Incubate at 37\" C. for 24 to 48 hours. The original plates shouldalso be kept in the incubator, again as a reserve. 142ii3 Procedure: Hour 4Students need all equipment and the following materials: the materials from laboratory hour three, andtwo each of the following sterile blanks, procedures are designed to study some of the biochemical activities of each group's two isolatedbacteria. If the bacteria ferment any of the sugars, that shows that the bacteria are using that sugar as a carbonsource for part of their nutritional requirement. If the bacteria degrade the protein broths in any way, that showsthat the bacteria are using that particular protein as a nitrogen source as part of their nutritional requirement.StepsA. Make a suspension from each of the stock cultures, and use the suspensions as inocula in the followingtests. Make the suspensions by following aseptic procedures. Take a loopful of bacteria from each of the stockcultures, and swish it around in distilled water in a blank.B. There are to be two test tubes for each of the broths and ferments, with one of each typeto be inoculated with separate bacteria. Put a loopful of a suspension in each test tube, using aseptic technique.Label each test tube. Note: confusing test tubes at this point will require a repeat of the procedures.C. Make a gelatin stab of each bacteria by using an inoculating Nith bacteria taken from the stockagar slants. You literally will stab a needle into the middle portion of the gelatin test tubes..Follow aseptic proce-dure. Label both test tubes.D. Incubate the gelatin cultures at room temperature for 24 to 48 hours. Incubate the broths and fermentsat 37\u00b0 C. for 24 to 48 hours.7. Why must you incubate the gelatin stabs at room temperature? Procedure: Hour 5Students need all listed equipment as well as the following materials: the materials from procedurehour four, nitrite test reagents A and B. and Kovac's reagent.Students now will read and record the biochemical activities of the unknowns in order to classify the bacteria.StepsA. Read and record the results of the sugar fermentations in the following manner.1) Gas has been produced (positive test) if there is a large bubble in the durham tube.2)Acid has been produced (positive test) if there is a pinkish color to the solution in the test tube.3) Acid and gas may both be produced by the same organism.9) No change has occurred if there is no color change and no gas formation. Bacterial growth is indi-cated by turbidity. If no growth has occurred. your test is not valid and must be repeated. 1434 8.

LaboratoryIsolation of Staphylococcus When you have completed this laboratory you should beable to:1.Observe some of the organisms which 3row in the humanthroat.2.Isolate a potential pathogen, Staphylococcus.3.Determine the pathogen's antibiotic sensitivity pattern. Parasitic RelationshipsWhen only one member of a symbiotic relationship benefits from the association, the relationship is saidto be parasitic. The organism which benefits from the relationship is the parasite, or pathogen, and the onewhich does not is the host. The host is usually harmed by the relationship and sometimes is killed by it. Apathogen usually is specific to the host it attacks and often also to the environment in which it may becomepathogenic.If one considers the large number of bacteria species which inhabit the skin and digestive tract of man,it is not surprising that some of the types found there could be capable of causing disease when the defensemechanisms of the host are weakened, or when the parasite somehow gains access to areas of the body inwhich it normally does not occur. For example, puerperal fever, a severe infection of the uterus which histori-cally killed large numbers of postpartum mothers, results when normally harmless streptococci of the throataccidentally gain access to a damaged uterus, such as during childbirth under unsanitary conditions.Microbial Flora of the Human BodyThe characteristic flora of the human skin includes Staphylococci. Streptococci. Cornybacteria such asC. diphtheriae. and coliform bacteria. Yeasts and other fungi live in the moist areas of the skin. This florais governed by nutritional conditions and by antibacterial properties of the skin, but no amount of bathingor scrubbing can totally remove these organisms. You are stuck with them for life.The most common permanent residents in the mouth and throat are types of Streptococci. Staphylococci.Neisseriae. Lactobacilli. and the Cornybacteria. The same types of bacteria inhabit the nose.These bacteria exist in a normally mutualistic situation in the human body. because by sheer numbersthey can retard the establishment of virulent pathogens to which we are routinely exposed. However, underspecial circumstances these bacteria may take on pathogenic properties.StaphylococciStaphylococci are gram positive cocci that tend to grow in irregular. grape-like clusters. They live as partof the normal flora of the human skin and upper respiratory tract. The most common infection caused byStaphylococci are skin lesions called \"boils\" or \"pimples.\" The cocci can become firmly entrenched in a hairfollicle, and their exotoxins accumulate and destroy surrounding cells, leading to pus formation. sometimes 149u 0 follicle, and their exotoxins accumulate and destroy surrounding cells, leading to pus formation. Sometimesthe cocci are introduced to the blood stream and are carried to other parts of the body, potentially causingrashes, meningitis, osteomyelitis (bone infection), and other diseases. It is very difficult to treat Staphylococciskin infections, both becz.use of the nature of the walled off lesions and because of the high rate of mutationof the cocci.Staphylococci may also cause food poisoning. They thrive in any suitable food which is kept warm forseveral hours, such as custards, cream filled pastries, milk products, and meats. They produce a powerfulexoto-Ain which, upon consumption in sufficient quantity, produces nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting.The symptoms persist for several hours, and while they usually are not fatal, victims have felt as if the endwere near.PurposeA potential pathogen becomes an active pathogen due to changed circumstances. There may be a changein the environment, such as entrenchment in a dirty and clogged hair follicle or transport from the throat tothe uterus. There may be a change in the host, such as a lessening of bodily defenses against infection becauseof emotional or physical trauma. Or there may be a mutation in the parasite itself, such as a change from anonhemolytic bacterium to a hemolytic (blood destroying) bacterium. In this laboratory you will attempt toisolate a hemolytic (and potentially pathogenic) Staphylococcus indicatorgram staining materialsEquipmentbunsen and the mannitol salts plates may be ordered from several suppliers. Refrigeratethem immediately upon receipt and store no longer than six months.2) Regular cotton swabs are readily available in grocery stores and pharmacies. Longer handled throatswabs may be available in your local pharmacy: if not, ask any medical laboratory or doctor.3) The antibiotic discs may be ordered from several suppliers. Refrigerate them immediately upon receipt.4) Refer to the special preparations sections of laboratories thirteen and fourteen for directions on makingblanks, deeps, TSY agar. and the 'gram staining materials. 150161 Time RequiredThe isolation of Staphylococcus laboratory requires one full classroom hour, in addition to two partialhours, plus preparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Partial Hour 1Students need the following: blood agar plate. mannitol salts plate, both types of cotton swabs, flamesource. inoculating loop, and sterile saline blank.During this laboratory session the student will transfer personal throat and nose bacteria to petri plates forincubation.StepsA. Moisten a sterile long handled swab in the sterile saline solution. Press the swab against the inside ofthe tube to remove excess saline.B.It is best to work in pairs during this step. It is difficult to swab your own throat. Swab yourpartner's throat, and roll the swab over one-third of the blood agar plate, taking care that all sides of the swabare rubbed against the agar surface. With a sterile inoculating loop complete the streaking to insure isolatedcolonies. Refer to laboratory thirteen for directions on this streaking procedure.C., Moisten the other cotton swab as in step B above, and thoroughly swab the inside of one of yournostrils. It may be more convenient again to have a partner for this procedure. Roll this swab over one-thirdof the mannitol saltS plate, and complete the streaking with a sterile inoculating loop to obtain isolated colonies.D. Label both plates. and incubate, inverted, at 37\u00b0 C for 24 72 hours.Procedure: Hour 2Students need all equipment and materials listed. The TSY deeps need to have been melted by heatingin a boiling water bath in preparation for this laboratory session.During this session the student will observe colonial growth on the agar plates and will set up an experi-ment to determine the effectiveness of different antibiotics on a chosen bacterial colony.Remember, you are handling potential pathogens. Be verycareful not to further contaminate yourself or others. When the laboratory is complete, gather the plates together and dispose of themcompletely after re-sterilizing. StepsA. Pour a .'SY plate.B. Examine the blood agar plate for different kinds of colonies. This population. which consists of aerobesor facultative anaerobes, is only a portion of the species of bacteria normally present in the throat. The othersare anaerobes.1. Look for colonies which are surrounded by an area of complete clearing of the red color, or hemolysis.Some of the genera which cause complete hemolysis are Streptococcus. Staphylococcus. Neisseria. andEscherichia. Make gram stains of several colony types. Label and draw them in the space provided. 1511 a) Colony shape and color Bacterial shape, gram stain, and planes of division Diagram: b. Colony shape and color Bacterial shape, gram stain, and planes of division Diagram: c) Colony shape and color Bacterial shape, gram stain, and planes of division Diagram: 1 G3152 2. Look for colonies which have a greenish halo of partial clearing, called alpha hemolysis. Some of theorganisms which cause alpha hemolysis are species of Streptococcus and Diplococcus. Make gram stains ofseveral colony types, label and draw them in the space provided.a) Colony shape and color Bacterial shape, gram stain, and planes of division Diagram: b.

Observe the mannitol salts plate for the presence of colonies surrounded by a yellow area caused byacid production. One of the criteria for a potentially pathogenic Staphylococcus is that it produces acid frommannitol. Compare this acid producing colony with the colonies on the blood agar plate. If the colony is trulya potentially pathogenic Staphylococcus, the colony on the mannitol salts plate should have a colonial appear-ance similar to a colony on the blood agar plate surrounded by an area of complete hemolysis. Both coloniesshould be white. Pick such a white colony, if present, and homogenize it in the tube of sterile saline. 3. Make a gram stain of the suspicious looking colony. Colony shape and colorBacterial shape, gram stain, and planes of division Diagram: D. Dip an inoculating loop into the saline suspension and streak the TSY plate poured during step A.Streak in three different directions to insure complete seeding of the entire agar surface. This type of streakingis illustrated in figure one. Figure 115 1E4 If the plate is thoroughly and evenly streaked in this manner, the resulting bacterial growth should com-pletely cover the surface of the agar, without isolated individual colonies like those produced on the bloodagar plate. The resulting generalized growth is called a bacterial lawn.\" 4. What might be the advantages in research from such a growth pattern? E. Dip the tips of a pair of clean forceps in alcohol and flame them. Pick up an antibiotic disc and dropit on the TSY agar plate about halfway between the center and the rim of the disc. Being careful not to touchthe agar with the forceps. press the disc gently to insure good contact between the disc and the agar. Placethe other three antibiotic discs in a similar manner, being certain that they are spaced apart from each otheron the agar plate. F.Incubate the plate, inverted, at 37\u00b0 C. for 24 - 72 hours.Procedure: Partial Hour 3Students need the antibiotic plates incubated in hour two.The bacterial growth should appear as a lawn\" covering the entire surface of the petri plate. with theexception of varying zones or areas of clearing around some of the antibiotic discs. These cleared areas areknown as zones of inhibition, and their size is an indication of the effectiveness of the antibiotic. The largerthe zone of inhibition, the more effective that particular antibiotic is against the variety of bacteria you haveisolated from your respiratory system. 5. List the antibiotics in order of effectiveness, from most to least.a) Most effectiveb) Second most effective c) Less effective d) Least effective (or not at all effective) 6. Given your current respiratory bacterial flora. if you were ill with a sore throat, which antibiotic should adoctor prescribe for you? Why? 7. Compare your results with those of your classmates. Are their findings similar to your own? Why, or why not? 155 ResourcesAbrahan, E.

LaboratoryIntroduction to the Algae When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Identify algae phyla by physical characteristics.2.Compare algae in terms of structure.3.Diagram the life cycle of typical algae. PurposeAlgae belong to the subkingdom Thallophyta which consists of plants lacking such specialized organsas roots, stems, and leaves. Algae species range from single celled plants to those with filaments. sheetsof cells, or even large branched thalli. However, they share one common feature; with few exceptions.algae live in water, because they lack water conducting and nutrient conducting tissues. Nearly all plantswhich live in the ocean are algae, and many of the plants inhabiting fresh waters and ocean shores alsoare algae.Although specialists differ on the taxonomical placement of algae. botanists generally consider thatthere are five primary phyla of algae grossly differentiated by color. You will have the opportunity in thislaboratory to study representatives from these major algae groups. They are an important and often over-looked form of life.Blue-green AlgaeBlue-green algae belong to phylum Cyanophyta. These are the only prokaryotic algae, in that they lackan \"organized- nucleus. Some place blue-green algae and bacteria with photosynthetic pigments in the samephylum, because their life cycle is similar in that they simply split in half to reproduce asexually. They mayalso reproduce by fragmentation of colonies or filaments, or by mitospores.The Cyanophyta contain chlorophyll a. but not chlorophyll b. and they have as an accessory pigmentphycocyanin. which gives them their characteristic color. Blue-green is the typical color, but because thereare many variations between the species in the kinds and proportions of pigments. still other colors are possi-ble. The Red Sea is said to have been so named because of the abundance of Trichodesmium. a blue-greenalgae which appears red. Because they are prokaryotes. the pigment is uniformly distributed throughout thecytoplasm of blue-green algae. and not in plastids. They commonly have gelatinous walls composed of pecticsubstances and store their food as glycogen. or glycoprotein. as animals do.Some genera of blue-green algae are capable of nitrogen fixation. just like some bacteria. It has beenestablished that they play a significant role in maintaining the fertility of rice paddies.Certain bacteria and blue-green algae thrive at temperatures far higher than those which can be withstoodby cells of other living things. Blue-green algae are common inhabitants of hot springs. In YellowstoneNational Park thermal blue-green algae can live at temperatures of 90\" C. (nearly the boiling point atthat altitude), and they provide the brilliant colors seen in hot springs, geyser run-offs, and limestoneterrace. pools 159 Blue-green algae are found in both fresh and salt water, although they are probably best known as theblue-green scum which can choke fresh water ponds and streams. Death and sickness to pets, livestock, wild-life, and even man have been attributed to blue-green algal toxins when concentrations in water supplies havebecome significant. The California State Water Resources Control Board, in their Water Quality Criteria Hand-book (second edition), states that \"there have been reports of rapid deaths of a great variety of animals afterdrinking water containing high concentrations of blue-green algae Aphanizomenon. Nostocrivulare. Nodularia. Gleotrichia. Gomphosphaeria. and Anabaena It is believed that such algae may be toxicto all warm blooded animals.\"Green AlgaeThe green algae belong to the phylum Chlorophyta. These algae have pigments generally similar in kindand proportions to those of higher plants. They are eukaryotic and exhibit motility in diverse forms, from amoeboidmovement to flagellation, and may be found as unicellular, colonial, or multicellular forms. They are mostlysmall, unicellular. globose, filamentous, or be septate, coenocytic (acontinuous protoplast not divided into definite cells), They reproduce both asexually byfragmentation or flagellated zoospores. and sexually by fusion of isogametes. In short. they exhibit all thevariations possible in evolution from a unicellular organism.They mostly inhabit fresh water, but they can occur many other places. such as in salt water and snow-banks (Chlamydomonas is the usual cause of red snow) and on turtles and sloths. Their food is stored as starchin specialized proteinaceous bodies called pyrenoids, like higher plants. Some produce oils instead of starch.The cell wall of Chlorophyta is in two layers: the outer layer is somewhat gelatinous and consists of pecticsubstances, while the inner layer is composed of cellulose, like higher plants. Their characteristic green colorcomes from pigments in the chloroplasts. They contain chlorophylls a and-b. a 13 carotene, and the xan-thophylls lutein and neoxanthin.The Chlorophyta are a major source of food for aquatic animals (especially in fresh water). They play onimportant role in the oxidation ponds of sewage treatment plants. providing through photosynthesis theoxygen used by bacteria to decompose sewage. However, they, along with the blUe-green algae. also can bea contaminant of fresh water supplies. The waterbloom which sometimes forms on the surface of reservoirs.lakes. and ponds in the summer is composed largely of planktonic green and blue-green algae.Yellow-green and Golden-brown the diatoms (whichare diploidall and to multicellular or colonial.They reproduce both asexually and sexually. Their characteristic color is yellow or brown, with accessorycarotenoids of several kinds, including chlorophyll e. which is not known in any other plant group. They livein both fresh and salt water. Their food is stored as oils or as carbohydrates other than starch.These yellowish algae. like other algae. are an initial link in the plant to fish food-chain, but otherwise thegroup generally has little obvious direct impact on man, excepting perhaps the diatoms. Diatoms not only makeup most of the vegetable plankton of the cooler parts of the ocean, being therefore the most important basefood source for fish and other marine animals. but since their \"shells\" are siliceous, these little creaturescontribute even in death. Diatomaceous earth is an important resource, used in many things from toothpasteto blast furnaces.Brown AlgaeBrown algae belong to the phylum Phaeophyta. There are many large marine forms of Phaeophyta.commonly called kelp Some brown algae are microscopic and filamentous. but most of them have a much 1600 larger, more complex thallus which can grow to more than 150 feet long. An accessory pigment calledfucoxanthin gives them their characteristic color. The brown algae store their food as mannitol and laminarin,both soluble polysaccharides.The brown algae reproduce asexually by fragmentation and by flagellated zoospores. They also reproducesexually,. exhibiting a distinctive alternation of generations from haploid (gametophyte) generation to diploid(sporophyte) generation, and back again. This alternation of generations is common to all the algal groups,with the exception of the Cyanophyta. Brown algae have heterogametes, that is, gametes in which the maleand female are easily determined by size and other distinctions.Algin. (C6I-1806),, is the common gelatinous outer pectic layer of the cell walls of brown algae, whilecellulose is the main component of the inner layer. Algin is used in the processing of natural and syntheticrubber latex. Kelps are harvested as a major food source by the Japanese. and also as a source of thecolloidal gel algin used in many prepared foods in Europe and America. Algin is used as a stabilizer oras a moisture retainer in a wide variety of commercial products. including ice cream, cake frosting, paints,and pharmaceuticals.Red AlgaeThe red algae belong to the phylum Rhodophyta. They are quite variable in form and mostly marine andattached. rather than free floating. They are nearly all multicellular, forming complex, well branched thalli. Theircells are uninucleate to multinucleate.Their characteristic color comes from an accessory pigment called phycoerythrin. Phycoerythrin absorbsespecially well toward the blue end of the light spectrum, and since blue light penetrates the farthest throughwater. the red algae have an ecological advantage in being able to live more deeply submerged than theirfellow algal groups. Their food reserves are usually stored as floridean starch (a substance which turns redor reddish violet when treated with iodine and which is unique to the Rhodophyta), soluble sugars, and some-times fats. They are the most advanced and complex of all the algae groups.Red algae are important sources of the colloids agar and carageenin. Prior to WWII, agar was producedalmost entirely in Japan from the genus Gelidium. Since then several genera off the coasts of North America.Australia, and South Africa have been found to possess agar. Agar is widely used as a culture medium forbacteria (laboratories thirteen. fourteen, and fifteen), as a stabilizer or filler in many commercial foods (anyoneprefer \"homemade\"?), and as a bulk producer in laxatives.Carageenin is extracted from the red algae called Irish moss, Chondrus crispus. Carageenin is used asthe emulsifying and stabilizing agent in many foods, such as chocolate milk and ice cream. Pre-labSupplies needed:Equipmentdissecting scope watch glassmicroscope slidesteasing needle coverslipsforceps Materialsalgal samples paper towelsSpecial PreparationsSamples of algae: if you do not live near the ocean, there are still many simple and inexpensive sourcesof algal samples. You will want to obtain at least five algal samples representative of the differentgroups.1) Neighborhood ponds. streams, and other wet places are often a good source for blue-green and greenalgae. Collect samples as much as two weeks before the actual laboratory. and store in a cool but well lit area.2) Fish tanks also have much to offer in the way of algal samples. It just depends on how rigorously theowners have scrubbed the tank walls. 3)Biological supply houses sell preserved specimens of all the major algal groups. One container will supplyan entire class with a specimen.4) Oriental grocery stores sell dried seaweed in many forms.. One package of a type will supply classesfor five years. so this is a very inexpensive source of samples. Large strips of kelp are available as \"konbun(Japanese): they are ih_the Chrysophyta. Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta are available as sheets of dried laver,or \"noir' (Japanese). Hold a sheet up to the light to determine the color and hence the phylum.To reconstitute dried algae. soak the laver or kelp in hot water for 20 30 minutes before running the labora-tory.Warning:kelp reconstituted becomes five times the package size through absorption of water.Time Required:The introduction to the algae laboratory requires two classroom hours, in addition to preparations,discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the listed equipment, as well as the following materials: algal samples in numbereddishes and water.You will be introduced to the wide structural variety of algae in this laboratory hour.StepsA. The teacher will have provided different species of algae in five numbered dishes. Prepare water mountson slides with coverslips of small bits of algae taken from each dish and examine under the microscope. 1621 12 1.

From your readings and observations this hour. determine the reasons for classifying these plants asThallophytaand as algae. 4Determine the phylum to which each of these algae belongs. Algae \"1 Algae \"2 Algae \"3 Algae \"4 Algae \"5 5. What characteristics are important in determining the phyla of algae? Itis interesting to compare algae of larger size with microscopic forms. The largest living algae aremarine species. There are. however, many small marine forms: some of them are unicellular. The classificationof algae is based on a complex series of characteristics involving form. reproduction, pigment :., metabolicproducts, and wall constituents. In this laboratory you have been introduced to only the most obvioussignposts of algal classification. Procedure: Hour 2Students need the listed equipment, as well as the following materia!s: tissues, the listed preparedslides, \"algal samples of available. 165 1.r ReproductionReproductive processes and structures are as variable as the forms of algae. and only a few samples canbe considered during this hour.The simplest methods of reproduction are asexual. such as the fission (dividing of an organism into twoorganisms) employed by simple algae. Other asexually reproducing algae multiply vegetatively by fragmenta-tion (breaking into fragments which may develop into independent plants). Still others produce special reproductivecells called spores. each of which may produce a new plant. Spores with flagella or cilia are motile spores.and. since their motility is animal-like, the spores are called zoospores. Other kinds of spores also are namedby special prefixes.Typical Asexual ReproductionThe flagellated cell which usually lacks a cellwall. The sporangium in which the zoospores are borne is usually derived from an ordinary vegetativecell: sometimes, however, itis a specialized cell morphologically unlike other cells. The entire protoplast ofthe sporangium may be transformed into a single zoospore. More often the protoplast undergoes one or moremitotic divisions. leading to the formation of two or up to a maximum of 32 spores within the original cell wall.Zoospores are commonly released through a pore which develops in the wall of the sporangium. Thezoospore swims about for a period from a few minutes to two or three days. depending on genus and species:one or two hours is the most common time. It then retracts or loses its flagella and secretes a wall, becominga vegetative cell.In multicellular or colonial types, the vegetative cell then undergoes a series of mitoticdivisions to produce a new organism or colony.Zoospores are haploid or sometimes diploid. In addition to being borne in sporangia, they are sometimesformed by reduction division from a zygote. or by mitotic divisions from akinetes (an algal spore producedby the transformation of a whole vegetative cell).Typical Sexual ReproductionThe sexual cycle of some algae involves alternating stages with N (haploid) and 2N (diploid) chromosomes.The 2N stage is brought about by the fusion of gametic nuclei, and the N condition is restored by reductiondivision. In many green algae, mitotic division occurs only during the haploid or N stage: therefore. the longestpart of the algae's life will occur in this stage. Other green algae have mitotic divisions occurring in both Nand 2N stages. A typical pattern might be as follows:1) Gametes fuse to form a Haploid cells (typically zoospores) are produced by meiosis. This affects some or all of the cells ofthe diploid thallus.4) The haploid thallus develops a series of mitotic divisions.5) Gametes form within some or all of the cells of the haploid thallus.This typical sequence of reproductive events is known as an alternation of generations. The N (haploid)stage is the gametophyte generation, and the 2N (diploid) stage the sporophyte generation.UlothrixIn a green alga called Ulothrix. zoospores are produced in any cell of the filament. They are formed ingroups of 4, 8. or 16. Ulothrix and Spirogyra are both examples of green algae. with mitotic divisions occurringonly in the haploid stage 166 StepsA. Examine a prepared slide of Ulothrix and locate vegetative cells and zoosporangia (cells containingzoospores). Each zoospore has four flagella and, after being shed from the sporangium, swims for a whilebefore becoming attached to the substratum and growing into a new filament. Details of spore structure arenot visible in the slides.B. Examine a prepared slide with Ulothrix gametangia. Often in the same filament housing zoosporangia,other cells may divide to produce 32 64 or 128 small motile-cells with two flagella. These biflagellate cellsare called isogametes and the structure (cell wall) containing them is a gametangium. 6.In the space provided below, compare gametangia with zoosporangia. 7. Draw a vegetative cell. a zoosporangium. and a gametangium in the space provided below. Label yourdrawings. Fusion of gametes results in a cell called a zygote. The zygote of Ulothrix develops a heavy wall andpasses through a dormant period. The heavy walled resting zygote is called a zygospore. On germination,the zygospore undergoes meiosis; additional mitoses result in the formation of 16 meiospores. The meiosporesare motile and are similar to the zoospores formed in the vegetative cells. 8. Why is the term meiospore preferred to zoospore at this stage? 1671 17 9. Could the zoospores of the vegetative filament be designated as mitospores? Why or why not? 10. Label the diagram of the life cycle of Ulothrix. figure two. Figure 2 1b81 13 FucusC. Fucus. one of the Phaeophyta, is a rather complex alga in both form and life cycle. If specimens areavailable, examine the plant and note the branching thallus and swollen tips. These swollen tips contain gametangiaof two kinds. In some species, the two sex organs are produced on separate plants: in others, they are formedtogether. Cut razor blade sections of the material and mount in water. Determine the kind(s) of sex organ(s)in your specimen. 11. Draw what you see in the space provided below and label the drawing. D. Examine prepared slides of Fucus showing gametangia and gametes. 12. Are the gametes alike in size') 13 What term could be used to describe these gametes which would distinguish them from the isogametesof Ulothrix? The small motile male gametes fuse with large non-motile female gametes. The resulting zygote germinatesand grows into a new plant. 14. Diagram a life history of Fucus with structures fully labeled. Vegetative; asexual reproduction may alsooccur from fragmentation of the thallus. Add the asexual cycle to the diagram of the sexual cycle. 169/ 9 15. Make a written comparison of the terms used in the reproductive cycles of Ulothrix and Fucus in the linesprovided below. The terminology involves new terms which are essential to serious biology students. Learnthese terms and the representative life cycles of Fucus and under the microscope slides of Spirogyra. Oedogonium. and Vaucheria. If specimens areavailable. also examine them.16. In what characteristics of structure: and reproduction do these plants differ among themselves and incomparison to Ulothrix and Fucus? 17.In what principal ways are these algae similar? 172 Additional Problems for DiscussionThe following questions may be considered as post-laboratory. activities. Your instructor may providesuggestions about avenues of inquiry, but you are to do your own thinking and organize your own work. Youmay want to consider outside resource materials in addition to your class notes and text. 18. Green flagellates (such as the Euglena.often studied in first year biology classes) are considered to begreen algae by botanists. Asexual and sexual (both isogamous and heterogamous) production are known inthe flagellates. Why would place flagellates in phyla, &though zoologists place themin one animal phylumtheProtozoa? 19. What evidence could be used to support the hypothesis that modern algae represent survivors and/orderivatives of geologically ancient algae groups? What objections to the hypothesis can you suggest? 20. What position do the algae hold in the food chain in a marine environment? What factors would youconsider important in determining the distribution of algae in the oceans? 173 21. Why are characteristics such as wall material and stored foods considered to be so important in definingphyla of algae? Why is color only a superficial characteristic?

LaboratoryIntroduction to the Fungi When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.List the classes of true fungi and their distinguishing characteristics.2.Identify the most common fungi and their importance to man.3.List the growth habits and reproductive characteristics of the fungalclasses4.Compare the different classes of fungi with each other and withother plants. PurposeMore than 40,000 species of fungi are known, and their large number is matched by their great impor-tance to man. Together with bacteria, the fungi are the principal agents of decay in our world. Fungi are usedfor food, in medicine, and in industry. They cause diseases of man. other animals, arid plants. It is as agentsof plant diseases that fungi have their greatest economic impact, for fungi are as dangerous to plants asbacteria are to us.Every student of the life sciences needs to have a working knowledge of the life habits. growth charactens-tics, and reproductive capabilities of the fungi. Sexual spores and life cycles. as well as asexual methods ofreproduction, will be explored in this laboratory.Fungus ClassificationThe phylum Eumycophyta. the fungi, is composed of four classes:1) the Phycomycetaceae which reproduce sexually by oospores and zygospores:the Ascomycetaceae which reproduce sexually by ascospores: which reproduce sexually by basidiospores: and, 4)the Deuteroyeetaceae which represent the as yet unclassified fungi whose reproduction is knownonly in the asexual or imperfect stages. Pre-labMuch of the material for this laboratory can be obtained from nature. Students need to start savingmaterial from the rotten world around them. Possibilities include moldy oranges. old bread, cheese, mushrooms,puffballs. and diseased plant leaves. It is amazing how many different kinds of fungi can be collected or grownin a three week period. Students, consider this a \"sneak preview\" of coming attractions. 177BUG Chytrid TrapsStudents also need to devote one hour, either in the classroom or at home, to the construction and settingof a chytrid apple trap. Making the trap. as well as starting the collection of fungi. needs to be done approxi-mately three weeks before the fungi laboratory. Students need the following materials for their traps:chicken wirewire cuttersstringapplesMake a wire -box\" large enough to fit one apple. Cut the chicken wire approximately per the followingdiagram. Then simply fold until a cube has been formed.WWOWOIROOOMEWUMOMOOOWO:::SOROOOKOMMOSSWOMDOMOO.1.MEMO0.N.111440.OWOOWNWOONWOMORSOU R5111111511t OORE:::::::::\"\"\"MalMilag :::: HON WOWAMOSON MMMMMM WO M SOHwleasineamSOOIOWOWOMMOOSIFOMOOeaavenutFigure 1 Take a bite out of the apple and put it into the wire cube. Chytrids are fungi that feed on fruit and livein freshwater ponds. The apple is bait. and the bite allows them ready access to the apple pulp. The c:iickenwire protects the bait from other apple loving creatures such as dogs, turtles, and fishes. Bend the wire securelyaround the apple. using the cut wire ends as fasteners, to form an approximate cube. Tie a strong string orrope of 10 to 15 meters in length to the apple trap. The trap is ready to be set.Locate a body of either temporary or permanent water, preferably stagnant. and throw the chytrid appletrap into the water. Tie the end of the string to a solid object on the bank of the pond. and hide it from thehungry and curious of the neighborhood. Leave the trap for three weeks.Once the students have collected home grown fungi and retrieved the chytrid apple trap. immediatepreparations for the fungi laboratory can begin.Other Supplies NeededEquipmentmicroscope apple trapsfrom their environment yeastNote:If students live in a moist area, and it has not frosted, they may be able to locate a slime mold(Myxomycophyta). These creatures are not true fungi (Eumycophyta), but they are extremely interesting toobserve. If a slime mold is brought to the classroom, put it into a moist terrarium with rotten wood and leafmold, and watch its activities. Slime molds have been known to travel the length of a terrarium in one hour.Time RequiredThe introduction to the fungi laboratory requires four classroom hours, in addition to prepara-tions, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the listed equipment, as well as the following materials: chytrid apple traps.The ChytridsThese organisms are representative of the Phycomycetaceae, commonly called water molds. Water mold!reproduce sexually by oospores in which the sexual spores are enclosed in a 6osporangium, or little bubblelike container. If environmental conditions are right, these spore cases may be collected. They look like this A A = bosporeB = SporangiumC = Nonseptate HyphaD = Resting SporeE = Septum Some water molds can be very destructive, causing such diseases as potato blight and fish ick. 179I StepsA. Take a teasing needle and obtain a small amount of pulp from the apple that was retrieved fromthe chytrid apple trap. Put the pulp on a microscope slide along with a drop of pond water. Cover it with acoverslip, and look at it under the low powered objective of the microscope.B. Students will find many interesting forms of life. Attempt to identify all that are seen. Ask the instructorfor help if necessary. Take care to categorize the life forms as to type. i.e. fungal, algal, protozoan, or insect.Draw identifications in the following chart, figure three. 1Fungal AlgalProtozoan Insect Figure 3 C. Eventually students should focus the microscope on small, clear, round. single celled creatures livingdirectly on the apple pulp. These are chytrids. Ask the instructor to verify the identification. Here is their taxo-nomical placement:Subkingdom:ThallophytaPhylum: Eu, nycophytaClass:PhycomycetaceaeOrder:Chytridiales2. Chytrids have never been grown successfully in the laboratory. From their appearance and growth environ-ment. what can you surmise about them? 1801i a 3. Describe the life cycle and structure of chytrids and compare them. with both algae and other fungi. 4. The phycomycetes as a group are known as algal fungi. Explain this terminology from your observationsof the Chytridiales. 5. How might one devise a growth medium for chytrids that would allow them to live in the laboratory? If you are interested in experimenting with the culturing of chytrids. devise a plan of action and see theinstructor for materials and equipment. This experiment could be the start of a major research paper. Yourinstructor will tell you what is expected in your report. Remember to keep accurate notes on this experiment.so that it could be duplicated if successful. Procedure: Hour 2Students need the listed equipment as well as the following slides and materials: Rhizopus zygosporesslide and the live material collected by students (black mold on bread or cake most likely would be Rhizopus).RhizopusnigricansThe organism Rhizopus nigricans is commonly known as bread mold, a member of the groupcalled black molds. It is one of the most common and widely distributed of all fungi. Rhizopus is 181 jt; 0 often seen as a black, cottony growth on bread and other foods. Black molds reproduce sexually by zygosporesborn on zygosporangia. They look like this: Some black molds can be very destructive and are a primary agent of putrifaction.A = ZygosporeB = SuspensorC = Hypha StepsA. Place a piece of old bread infected with Rhizopus in water on a slide. Use needles to tease apart thebread. After the bread is finely separated. remove excess material and mount the preparation under a coverglass. Among the starch grains of the bread will be thread-like strands of the mold. 6. What color are these strands? 7. Are they branched or unbranched? 8. Septate or nonseptate (with cross walls or without)? 9. Why may it be impossible to see the nuclei? 10. Are the contents uniform in appearance? 11.Is there evidence of mold on the surface of the bread? 12. What is the source of food for the mold? The thread-like strands of fungi are called hyphae (singular hypha), and the hyphae form a mass of strandscalled, collectively, the mycelium (plural mycelia). 182191 B. Examine mycelia from several older bread cultures. Aerial hyphae may run parallel to the surface ofthe bread, or they may be erect. Erect hyphae usually grow reproductive structures that are asexual and arecalled sporangia (singular sporangium) at their tips. They look like this: A = SporangiumB = SporeC = ColumellaD = SporangiophoreE = StolonF = Rhizoid 13. What steps occur in the development of the bul:.)ous tip which ultimately becomes black as the spores mature? 14. Each spore may produce a new mycelium. These spores can also be called mitospores. Why? Cultures of Rhizopus usually reproduce by means of mitospores. However, there are occasional wildcultures which produce sexually and form zygospores. In laboratories, molds are maintained by asexualsubcultures. Strains of Rhizopus which are known to mate can be kept separately. Cultures can be preparedby placing spores or mycelia from known mating cultures at two sides of an agar substrate. The mycelia 1831-JLI ()_ from the two strands appear structurally identical. Where hyphae of opposite strains meet, cell walls cut offgametangia, gametangia join, and the gametes fuse. The zygote enlarges and develops a heavy wall. Thisresting zygote is called the zygospore..15. The zygospore. in germination, produces a hypha which is usually terminated by a single germ sporangium.Theoretically the germ sporangium should contain meiospores. which would produce both strains of the mold.Strains of this kind are described as + (plus) and (minus) strains. Why is this terminology more desirablethan male and female? 16. Since one cannot tell the difference in the + and strains, is Rhizopus isogamous or heterogamous? 17.If spores were planted in the positions shown in the diagram below. what pattern would be formed bythe zygospores? Draw the pattern on the diagram. The dotted lines indicate where the mycelia probably wouldmeet. Figure 6 18. What method could be used for determining the strain of an unknown culture? 19. What reasons are there for suggesting the possibility that fungi are derived from algae? 1841O3 20. Is Rhizopus nigricans a parasite or a saprophyte?21. What may account for the rare occurrence of zygospores in wild cultures of Rhizopus? . Phytophthora InfestansAnother Phycomycetaceae organism causes late blight in potatoes. It singlehandedly changed the courseof human history when it struck in epidemic proportions from 1845 1847 in Europe. It caused widespreadfamine and death, and, as a direct result, hundreds of thousands of Irish immigrated to the United States andSouth America. The genus and species name of this phycomycete is Phytophthora infestans. It also causeslate blight of tomatoes. The symptoms are similar to late blight of potatoes, anri the fruit is readily infectedand subject to rot. Tomato blight occasionally appears in epidemic proportions in humid and hot areas of theUnited States. The phycomycetes, for very practical economic reasons. can not be ignored.Procedure: Hour 3Students need the listed equipment and the following slides and materials: Clauiceps peritheca, Pezizaascocarp. yeast (if dried, dissolved in warm water with sugar or honey added), and student material (greenmolds on baked goods. cheeses. and oranges are often Penicillium mold).The AscomycetesThese organisms, also known as the ascus. or cup fungi. constitute one of the largest groups of fungi.They include the cup fungi. yeasts, powdery mildews, blue and green molds, and many others. They causesuch important plant diseases as chestnut blight. Dutch elm disease, brown rot of stone fruits, peace leaf curl.apple scab, and vegetable soft rot. Cup fungi reproduce sexually by ascospores which are produced insidea saclike, enlarged end of a hypha which is known as an ascus. The ascus almost always holds eight sporesand looks like this: B. Figure 7 1854A = ZygosponB = SuspensorC = Hypha Because of the antibiotic (against life) properties of some molds, a number of the ascomycetes areimportant bacteria fighting agents.StepsPenicilliumA. Examine cultures of Penicillium. It is often found as green mold on oranges and other foodstuffs. Mountsome of the mycelium in a drop of water on a slide and cover with a coverslip. Examine under the microscope. 22. Compare its general growth habits with Rhizopus. 23. What is the difference in structure of the hyphae of rhycomycetes and ascomycetes? 24. How are mitospores born on Penicillium2 25. Why are spores produced in this way given a special name, the conidiospores7 Students by now may have surmised that the fungus they have been watching is the source of the wonderdrug penicillin. They additionally ought to know that Penicillium colors and flavors Camembert, Roquefort.and other cheeses.Saccharomyces (Yeast)B. Examine cells of yeast which have been grown in a nutrient solution composed of cane sugar and minerals.Each cell is a plant of yeast. In producing new cells, a chain of individuals may be formed. 26. In the material supplied, what proportion of the cells is separate? 27. Why does the grouping of yeast cells indicate \"budding\" rather than fission reproduction? 18611-3 5 28. Under some circumstances, yeast may produce four or eight meiospores. The cell then functions as anascus. Yeast cells which produce spores are diploid: the ascospores are haploid. Where does meiosis occur? 29. Vegetative reproduction (budding) may occur in either the diploid or haploid phase. What does thiscondition suggest in regard to the nature of spores and gametes? Clauiceps purpurea (Ergot of Rye)C. Examine slides of ergot fruiting bodies and other specimens, if avalable. Compare with normal grainsof rye. Notice that when the sclerotia (hardened knobs of mold) produce erect stalks, sexual reproductionis about to take place. The knob-like tips (\"fruiting bodies: stromata) conidiospores and ascospores 31. Why is Claviceps classified as an. ascomycete2 32. In what sectors of agriculture might Claviceps be important? It is fascinating to read reports of the important role Claviceps played in the witch trials in Salem, Mas-sachusetts. Perhaps students would be interested in researching this historic intrusion of a fungus among us.Ask your instructor how to research and structure your report.PezizaD. Examine a \"fruiting body; or ascocarp of Peziza,on prepe.v.;c1 slides and. if possible. from nature. Itrep-esents only a small part of the plant. Peziza.or bird's nest fungus. grows in humus or decaying wood andproduces visible cuplike growths above ground. Many branching hyphae are formed in the substrate longbefore the cuplike structures are formed. 187 33. Why might this be expected? 34, What functions wouid the subterranean mycelia serve? 35. Draw a diagram of the Peziza ascocarp. 36. Examine slides of the ascocarp under high power. Or: what surfaces are the meiospores born? 37. Why is it sometimes not possible to determine the number of spores produced? 38. Why is the spore-bearing layer called the fertile layer, or hymenium? 39. Determine, either from the prepared slide or from specimens, how many spores are born in a sporangium? 40. What is the shape of the spore containing structure?An asci filled with ascospores has just been described.The nuclear changes in Peziza are not adequately known. Another ascomycete, Pyronema. has beenstudied extensively and can be used as a model for a standard ascomycete life cycle. Pyronema is oftendiscussed in standard textbooks. 18819 7 41. From data supplied by lecture, text, or laboratory instructor, construct a labeled diagram in the space providedbelow to illustrate the sexual cycle of an ascomycete. (A typical life cycle diagram is shown on page 168.) Procedure: Hour 4Students need the listed equipment, as well as the following and infected barberry or wheat, if available). BasidiomycetesThe basidiomycetes are fungi that primarily reproduce sexually, and thus they are considered the mostadvanced class of true fungi, or Eumycophyta. They include the largest fungi and those that are best known.The meiospore of the Basidiomycetaceae is called a basidiospore and is borne on a basidium. It looks like this: 189 Figure 8A = BasidiosporeB = Basidium The Basidiomycetaceae are composed of two sub-classes which are very useful in categorizing the differ-ent types of basidiomycetes. They are:Heterobasidiomycetaceae have following orders--Uredinale(rusts)Ustilaginales (smuts), andTremellales(jelly fungi):Holobasidiomycetaceae (single or entire basidia) which have the following additional sub-classesHymenomycetaceae (mushrooms and allied fungi), andGastromycetaceae (puffballs and their allies).StepsAgaricusA. Examine fruiting bodies of Agaricus campestris, a species of common field mushroom, both as a pre-pared slide and fresh from the grocery store. The structure consists of a stalk (the stipe), and a cap (the pileus).42. Where is the vegetative mycelia attached? B. The pileus consists in its lower portion of many radiating, blade-like gills. The gills consist of many hyphaewith fertile tips. Remove a gill. or portion of a gill. and examine it for spores.43. What name would be used to describe the layer of spore-bearing hyphae744. Diagram the fruiting body of a mushroom and label its parts. 190 C. Spores are borne in groups of four. Each spore is borne on a short stalk or sterigma. The hyphal tipbearing the four basidiospores is as a basidium.45. Compare Agaricus with Pyronema (or Peziza) in terms of form, structure, and life cycle. Write in thefollowing space. PuffballsD. Other basidiomycetes include puffballs such or Polyporus.Examine available specimens.46. Compare a puffball collected from the wild with a mushroom such as Agaricus LichensE. Examine available specimens of lichens under the microscope.47. Why are lichens classified as lichens and the components of a lichen classified as fungi and algae?____ Many basidiomycetes are considered gastronomic delights. Mushrooms and their allied fungi are prizedfoods, as well as feared sources of poison. It depends on the species. For example, Amanita caesareum wasused during the Roman empire to kill political enemies. On the other hand, the French and Italians go to greatexpense to obtain truffles for their cooking, and the Japanese scour the woods for shiitake. 191 Many diseases of plants are caused by basidiomycetes. Large sub-classes of disease producing forms areknown by the common names \"rusts\" and \"smuts?' The conspicuous asexual spore of these fungi is the telio-spore. This spore germinates to form an elongated basidium, which produces the basidiospores. Some rustfungi require only one host, while others require two hosts belonging to different species.48. From your knowledge of the growth habits of fungi, discuss the weather conditions which might favoran epidemic of these diseases. 49. What effects do rusts and smuts have on their host plants? 50. Are they considered parasites or saprophytes?Puccinea graminisThe fungus Puccinea graminis produces a disease of grains known as black, red, or stem rust. There aremany races of the rust which affect wheat with varying degrees of severity. Development of resistant strainsof wheat is sometimes hampered by the gradual but steady development of new races of the rust. Puccineagraminis produces five kinds of spores. Two of these, the aeciospore and pycniospore, are produced onbarberry. Two, the uredospore and teliospore, are produced on wheat or other grasses. The fifth, the basidio-spore, grows from the basidium and is not produced on any host. The life cycle of the rust is complex, butit must be known because effective controls of rust must be based upon its life cycle.The leaves of infected wheat are often marked with reddish spots. This color is produced by red sporesformed under the epidermis by the fungus mycelium. The spores are called uredospores, and the pustule iscalled an uredosorus. Uredospores may directly reinfect wheat plants.F. Examine slides of wheat leaf showing uredosori. This stage in the life cycle is commonly referred toas the \"red rust\" stage.51. Where is the the spores?Each basidiospore may infect Berberis (barberry), but not wheat. In barberry bushes the basidiospores formmycelia which puncture the upper epidermis to form pycnia (a specialized spermagonia). The spermagonia,and the mycelia producing them, are of two kinds. Each spermagonium consists of slender hyphal lips andmany minute cells called pycniospores (a special form of spermatia). Fusion of mycelial cells from the two typesof spermagonia, or fusion of a spermatium with a hypha from the other mycelium. results in a diploid cell.The nuclei do not fuse. A binucleate mycelium binucleate cell. The binucleate myceliumproduces \"cluster cups,\" or aecia, on the lower side of the Berberis leaf.G. Examine leaves of barberry for evidence of spermagonia and aecia, or examine prepared slides of thesame.52. How many mycelia are involved in their formation?These aeciospores spread to and infect wheat plants. The barb 7ry bush is a classic example of an innocu-ous appearing plant which serves as an intermediary for a serious disease of an important agricultural crop.Another 'example is the role of gooseberries and currants in the transmittance of white pine blister rust. 192iJ 53. The cycle o' wheat rust is outlined in figure nine. Illustrate the structures named, include evidence of theirnuclear conditions, and tell whether the rust is on a grass, barberry, or the ground during each stage of thecycle. Show your work on figure nine.Uredosorus4Uredospore 44,II___.-----t--- Mycelium Aeciospores Mycelium -----Cell fusionFigure 954. Do the nuclear phases coincide with the alternate host?55.

Canadian winters are too severe to permit survival of the uredospores. In certain Canadian wh It growingareas, there also are no Berberis plants. Despite this, why are these areas sometimes visited with heavyinfestations of wheat rust? Students have now seen that Puccinia graminis produces five kinds of spores during its complex lifehistory. No other fungus so threatens one of the world's basic food crops. As much as 25% of the world's wheatcrop has been lost in a single year because of this parasite. The world's agricultural authorities have investedheavily in such rust control effort as improved agricuitural practices, the wholesale destruction of barberry plants,and genetically breeding rust resistant strains of wi,eat.

LaboratorySurvey of the Mosses When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.List the orders and classes of some Bryophyta and theirdistinguishing characteristics.2.Identify the most common Bryophyta and their growth habits.3.List the reproductive characteristics of the Bryophyta. PurposeMosses are interesting not only because they are primitive land plants, but also because they have lifecycles with a distinctive alternation of generations. This is a condition peculiar to some plants in which thereis a sporophyte phase that produces spores, alternating with a gametophyte phase that produces gametessuch as sperm and egg. Mosses are considered to be the most primitive of the higher plants. The mosses,belonging to the phylum Bryophyta, sub-kingdom Embryophyta, antheridia (maleorgans producing sperm) and archegonia (female organs producing eggs), but they lack specialized conduct-ing tissues such as xylem and phloem like other higher plants. The Bryophyta, like algae and fungi, do notpossess true roots, stems, or leaves.The sporophyte generation attaches to the gametophyte and is partly or wholly parasitic on it. When wethink of a moss plant we think of the haploid plant, because the diploid plant is simply an appendage on thelarger, photosynthetic, and conspicuous gametophte.There are three mosses, common mosses (Musci). the liverworts (Hepaticae), and the hornworts(Anthocerotae). The hornworts are the least common, and in this laboratory you will study the structure andreproductive cycles of the two more common classes, the Musci and the Hepaticae.Pre-labSupplies needed:Equipmentdissecting scope eye dropper are several ways to obtain fresh Bryophyta materials:1) Fresh or preserved materials may be ordered from biological supply houses.2)If you live where mosses and liverworts grow, have students collect as many types as possible in thefall of the year. Put these plants in a terrarium and water occasionally. The mosses will develop the sporophytecapsule during the winter, if the room is heated and thus simulates spring.3) Buy or collect the spores of Bryophyta. Soak an brick in water, and place it in a shady, coolplace, in a pan sufficiently deep to keep half the brick wet when filled with water. Sprinkle the spores overthe brick's surface, and in a month or two you will have sufficient moss plants for the laboratory. This brickwill be an excellent device to grow a steady supply of moss plants over the years. If you want the plants todevelop reproductive capsules out of season, simply remove some from the brick and place them in a terrariumin the heated classroom four to six weeks before you wish to study the plants. Time RequiredThe survey of the mosses laboratory requires two classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion,and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need all listed equipment and materials, as well as the following slides: Mnium and Polytrichum.You will observe the structures and life cycle of common mosses during this laboratory hour. Mnium andPolytrichum are typical mosses which belong to the order Bryales. class Musci, phylum Bryophyta, subkingdomEmbryophyta.StepsA. Examine available moss plants for general characteristics of the plant body. Carefully wash a smallspecimen. mount it in water on a watch glass, and examine it under a dissecting microscope.1. What kind of structure anchors the plant and serves as an absorbing organelle? 2. What is its color?3. How many cells compose it?4. Why is it not called a root? 5. HoW are the \"leaves\" arranged on the axis? 6. How thick are the \"leaves)7. What is the range in size of the moss plants available for study? 198 B. Dissect an antheridial cluster from the top of a Polytrichum or similar species. The flower-like tip ofsome plants contains the antheridia. By removing the center of the rosette, and separating the parts with ateasing needle, some antheridia will be observable.8. How can the antheridia be distinguished from moss \"leaves'? 9. Are there any sterile structures among the antheridia?10. Are these antheridia structurally similar to antheridia of Thallophyta such as those studied in laboratorysixteen?11. Can you distinguish empty and full antheridia?C. Take .And hold an antheridium so that the tip is between your thumb and forefinger. Simultaneouslysqueeze the tip and roll it between your thumb and forefinger. Submerge the tip of the leafy shoot in a dropof water on a slide and tease out the fragments from the tip of the shoot with a teasing needle. The malesex organs are simple, saclike structures. They produce large numbers of sperm cells. Place a coverslip onthe slide, and observe the slide under first low power, and then high power of a microscope.12. How many sperms (approximately) are produced in an antheridium of this moss?D. Compare these antheridia with sectioned antheridia in the prepared slide of Polytrichum.13. Draw and label the parts of an antheridium of Polytrichum in the space provided below. E. Examine prepared slides of longitudinal sections of a plant of Mnium. The secions are from plants whichproduce archegonia. At the top, in a rosette comparable to the antheridial cluster of Polytrichum, are egg containingstructures mingled with sterile cells. Some of these structures will expose the egg. The jacket of cells enclosingthe egg is extended into a long neck-like structure. The neck, if sectioned near the middle, will show a rowof cells enclosed by. the neck.14. Why is it rarely possible to show, in section, a whole archegonium? 15. What is the essential difference between an oogonium (studied in laboratory sixteen) and an archegonium? 199 16. Since the sperm are motile (able to swim), how would they reach the arch,. jonium? 17. Where would they enter an archegonium? 18. What would happen to the cells contained in the neck, before the sperm reach the egg? 19. What connection does the zygote bear to the antheridial and archegional plants? 20.If the zygote were to undergo cell division indefinitely, what would be the source of food for the new diploidcells? 21. What would be the source of water? 22. How could the sources of food and water be determined experimentally? F. Examine moss plants bearing capsules. These capsules are produced by the growth and cell divisionof the zygote. The capsule is borne on a stalk, the seta, and is attached to the leafy plant by a bulbous foot.These three parts, foot, seta, and capsule, represent the diploid phase of the moss plant.In some mosses, th archegoniurn enlarges with the growing capsule for a perioc-I of time. When the setaelongates, the archegonial tissue tears; the losker portion remains as a basal cup, and the upper part formsa hood (calyptra) on the top of the capsule.23. Why are the capsules associated with a leafy plant? 24. Would the cells of this archegonial hood (calyptra) be haploid or diploid? Why or why not? 200 G. Certain cells of the capsule undergo meiosis and produce meiospores. Examine slides of a capsulewhich you have made by sectioning a capsule and placing it in a drop of water with a coverslip. The darkerstreaks of cells are the areas of spore formation.25. What percentage of the capsule is used in the production of spores?26. Why is spore producing tissue said to be fertile tissue in contrast to the rest of the capsule which is sterile tissue? H. The cansule may have an elaborate mechanism for the dispersal LL spores. In most mosses a smalldid is formed at the apex of the capsule and at maturity, th2 lid, or operculum, is removed. Many capsulesare rimmed with a series of long \"teeth\" which help in the discharge of spores. Remove the operculum andcut off the rim of the capsule. Mount this rim on a slide and observe the rather elaborate structure.27. List several reasons why many moss plants do not bear capsules 28. The spores germinate and form thread-like green plants called protonemata (singular: protonema). Theprotonemata produce buds which grow into moss plants. How would you distinguish protonemata fromfilamentous algae? 29. The spore bearing phase of the moss plant is generally called the sporophyte. The antheridial and archegonialplants are called gametophytes. How do these phases correspond to the haploid and diploid phases? 30. Are the diploid and haploid phases of algae and funs comparable with the gametophyte and sporophyteof a moss? How or how not? 201 31. Some mosses produce antheridia and archegonia on the same plant. What term would describe thiscondition?32. What term describes the condition in Polytrichum where some plants are antheridial and others arearchegonial?Procedure: Hour 2Students need all the equipment and materials listed, as well as the following hour the student will observe the structures and life cycles of two more typical Bryophyta, thepeat mosses and liverworts. Peat mosses belong to with other mosses, but they arein the or! ar Sphagnales. Liverworts belong to the class Hepaticae.StepsA. Examine plants of Sphagnum and compare them with common mosses.33. How can you distinguish between a \"branch\" and a \"leaf'? 34. Where are \"branches\" and \"leaves\" most closely spaced? 35. How does this arrangement compare with the position of leaves and branches on higher plants? B. R,?rnove a \"leaf\" from one of the plants. place it in a drop of water with a coverslip, and examine itunder the micr ,:ope.36. How many Kinds of cells are there in the \"leaf'?37. How are they arranged? 38. Can you suggest any relation between structure and water holding capacity? Explain Archegonia and antheridia are similar to those of other mosses. They are borne on lateral \"branches\" inthe apical region of the plant. Capsules are relatively rare. The axis of the archegonial cluster elongates andforms a stalk: the sporophyte itself does not form a seta. The sporogenous cells of the capsule occupy a smallarea near the surface. 202 39. Why is such a stalk not equivalent to a seta?C. Examine plants of available liverworts and compare them with mosses.40. Why is it possible to distinguish liverworts from algae? 41. Where are rhizoids (root-like structures) produced in liverworts')42. Why are the leaves\" of mosses and \"leafy liverworts\" not considered true leaves? D. Small cup-like growths are borne on many species. These cup-like structures on liverwort gametophytescontain small buds of gemmae (vegetative reproductive structures formed by mitotic divisions) which may growinto new plants. Using a teasing needle, remove some gemmae from one of the gemmae cups and examinein a water mount under the microscope.43. Why are these structures not called spores? E. Antheridia and archegonia are borne in many positions and on various kinds of specialized structures.The fertile portions of Marchantia are rather complex and specialized. In fresh or preserved specimens, examinethe structures bearing antheridia and archegonia. They are erect, peltate lobes of the thallus, in contrast tothe flat. thallose vegetative lobes.F. Also examine prepared slides of sections of both an antheridial and an archegonial \"branch \".44. On which surface are antheridia produced? 45. Compare the antheridium of Marchantia with that of Polytrichum in the space provided below. 46. Where are the archegonia produced? 47. Flow many eggs are produced in each archegonium? 2031)1- 4 48. Compare the position and orientation of the archegonia of Marchantia with the archegonia of Mnium inthe space provided below. 49. Is there any possible advantage in the difference in position and orientation? If there is. what is it? G. Examine sections of the capsule of Marchantia.50. What evident similarity is there between the capsule of a moss and a capsule of a liverwort? 51. Where would meiosis occur?52. What are the products of meiosis? 53. How would new thalli be produced? 54. Is Marchantia homothallic255. In the space provided below, construct and label the structures in a generalized gametophyte and sporophyteplant for the phylum Bryophyta. 2043 56. Can you generalize in this fashion for the !sal and fungal groups? Why or why not? 57. Prepare a chart. figure one, showing homologies of a green alga, a moss, and a liverwort.

LaboratoryIntroduction to the Club Mosses and Horsetails When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to: 1.List the distinguishing characteristics of the to terms oftheir growth and reproductive characteristics. BackgroundThe Tracheophyta are popularly known as the vascular plants. Their primary distinguishing features arevascular bundles, or tissues such as xylem and phloem, with which they conduct water and nutrients. Becauseof this system of transport and support, vascular plants achieve heights and mass well beyond that seen inthe Thallophyta or Embryophyta. The sub-kingdom Tracheophyta is undoubtedly the most familiar of all theplant groups, in that it includes such plants as ferns, pines. grasses, onions, apples, and orchids.In. this laboratory you will explore some of the simplest vascular plants, the club mosses as well as thehorsetails and Psilotum (no common name). These are the most primitive vascular plants, containing featuresmore advanced than algae. fungi. and mosses; none of them, however, produces seeds or retains true rootslike the higher vascular plants.ClassificationBoth as a review of previous laboratories and as an introduction to the Tracheophyta,let us con-sider a classification scheme in which the kingdom Plantaeis divided into three sub-kingdoms. Thissystem represents an effort to organize the myriad species of plants on the basis of similarities anddifferences in structure and life cycles. Such differentiations and classification schemes are not abso-lute. You should be aware that some organisms which share a few characteristics are sometimes placedin different phyla, divisions, or even sub-kingdoms, because of still other 4mportant characteristics.Even with these reservations, such classifications greatly assist efforts to understand and comprehen-sibly organize the plant kingdom. Sub-kingdomDivisionPhylumPhylumPhylumPhylumPhylumDi VisionPhylumPhylumKingdomPlantaeThallophytaSub-kingdomEmbryophytaAlgaePhylumBryophytaCyanophytaChlorophytaChrysophytaPhaeophytaRhodophytaFungiMyxomycophytaEumycophyta 209Sub-kingdomDivisionPhylumPhylumPhylumPhylumDivisionPhylumPhylumPhylumTracheophytaPteridophytaPsilophytaLycopsidaSphenopsidaFilicophytaPhanerophytaCycadophytaConiferophytaAnthophyta PsilophytaThe Psilophyta are the most primitive of the Tracheophyta. Although they contain vascular tissues, theydo not have true roots and often lack leaves. They reproduce by spores rather than seeds. However, the gameto-phyte and sporophyte generations are physiologically independent of each.other at maturity, unlike the Bryophyta.Most of the Psilophyta are only known by fossil remains from the Silurian and Devonian age, but three speciesstill exist. Tmesipteris tannensis is confined to Australia and some of the Pacific Islands. Psilotum complanatumand Psilotum nudum are widespread in the tropical and subtropical regions of both hemispheres. In NorthAmerica. Psilotum nudum extends as far north as South Carolina.In the Psilophyta, as in all the Tracheophyta, the diploid generation is dominant. Also, as in all thePteridophyta. the haploid generation is subterranean, or nearly so, and very small compared to the diploid.In the Psilophyta the gametophyte lack chlorophyll and must obtain nutrients from a mycorrhizal associationwith a phycomycetous fungus. The Phycomycetaceae are the only fungal group known to have existed in theDevonian period, when the Psilophyta were most abundant and when this association likely developed.Fertilization of sperm and egg follow a pattern similar to the Bryophyta studied in laboratory eighteen.When the sporophyte of a Psilophyta becomes established as an independent plant. a layer of cells is formedseparating it from the gametophyte. This is called an abscission layer, because the disintegration of its cellsdetaches the shoot from the gametophyte foot. The gametophyte may persist for some time after thesporophyte has become established, but sooner or later it dies and degenerates. Stem growth is from the tip(apical growth) rather than from inserted groups of cells (intercalary growth), as can be seen commonly inthe Thallophyta and in the kingdom Animalia. This life cycle pattern is common to all the Pteridophyta, andcan be diagrammed as seen in figure one.144eggA = = SporangiumC = SporeD = and horsetails are plants with a long history. extendingfrom the paleozoic to the present. similar in this respect to the Psilophyta. The living members are of nogreat economic significance to man, but in the past many members of these two phyla were prominent. A 210 knowledge of the structure and reproductive methods of the surviving members of these groups provides manyclues to the extinct species, which can be studied only from their fossil remains.The Lycopsida and Sphenopsida are spore-producing vascular plants with roots, stems, and leaves.However, in the Lycopsida the primary root does not persist to maturity, and therefore, upon digging,one finds adventitious roots arising from the internal tissues of the stem, or from stem-like organs calledrhizophores.In both the Sphenopsida and the Filicophyta, a similar situation exists, but the under-ground horizontal stem is known as a rhizome, just as it is called in some higher plants like bluegrass andirises.The roots of all Pteridophyta are not true roots at maturity. This is an important distinction from thePhanerophyta. along with spore production versus seed production, and still another reason to classify theseplants together in the Pteridophyta. Their primary (known as initial) direction of growth is in one directiononly. whereas in seed-producing plants, there are two initials of growth, those directions being the oppositeof one another.LycopsidaThe Lycopsida have only two living genera, Selaginella. The Lycopodium areknown as the club mosses, or ground pines. There are about one hundred living species, and they areall homosporous (producing one kind of spore), The Selaginella are known as small club mosses, or spikemosses. There are about five hundred species of Selaginella. and they are all heterosporous (produc-ing two kinds of spores. one giving rise to male gametophytes and the other giving rise to femalegametophytes).The Lycopsida flourish from the tropics to temperate climates, especially in cool, moist, temperate forests.Many tropical species are epiphytic (grow above ground on other plants). The size of their branches variesfrom one to eight inches in height, and their horizontal stems elongate by apical growth, forming long runners.The stem in cross section reveals an epidermis. a wide cortex, and. a pithless vascular cylinder composed ofxylem and phloem. As the older parts die, younger branches continue to grow: thus, a single plant can giverise to several plants.Lycopsid StructureLycopsida (club moss) leaves are small and numerous, and in some species so scale-like and small thatthe branches are mistaken for leaves. The place on the stem where a leaf is attached is called a node, andthe part of the stem between one node and the next is called an internode. Lycopsida leaves are said to bealternate if only one is borne per node, opposite if two are borne, and whorled if three or more are borneper node. In most of the Lycopsida, the leaf has a small appendage on the upper side toward the stem. Thisappendage is called a ligule. Some botanists think that leaves may have originated from a modificationof a dichotomously branched stem system. and that the ligule represents a vestigial branch in the primitiveLycopsida. Branching is always dichotomous.Because the direction of growth is in one direction only, these plants cannot be transplanted unless theinitial, or beginning point of sporophyte growth is transplanted as well. The author's mother attempted, severaltimes, to transplant Lycopodium from a farm to her own home, only to continually fail, never realizing thatthe failure was due to a lack of true roots and the absence of the initial growth point in the transplanted sectionsof the plants. Life- CycleThe spores of Lycopsida are produced in large kidney shaped sporangia borne singly in the axils of thesporophyll. In the more advanced club mosses the sporophylls are grouped into cone-like structures calledstrobili. Spores are formed from spore mother-cells after meiosis. They are tetrahedral with radiating lines 211 on one side, and they escape the sporangium from a slit on its side, like the following: Spore Figure 2Sporangium Sporophyll The prothallus, or gametophyte Lycopsida, typically germinates below ground and lackschlorophyll. The prothallus has a mycorrhizal association with fungi and is saprophytic on humus in the soil.It is thought that the associated fungus benefits from this association. The prothallus takes three to seven yearsto germinate, and another six to fifteen years to mature, depending on the environment and the species ofLycopsida involved.The sex organs of the prothalli are borne on top, sunken in the tissues of the plant. The sperm are motileand need water to swim to the egg. After fertilization the diploid zygote produces the leafy plant. One prothal-lus may produce several plants and may persist for several years. ultimately being consumed by the sporophytegeneration.Modern Selaginella are heterosporous; and their life cycle follows the pattern shown in figure three.Microspore Microsporophyl Megosporophyll SporophyllPlant FertilizedEgg Figure is estimated that the Lycopsida composed up to a third of the ground cover of the pre-colonial forestsof Eastern North America, and that lumbering and clearing for farms has massively reduced incidence of thephylum. The modern Lycopsida are of minor economic importance. Some of the Lycopodium are used inChristmas decorations, and both Lycopodium and Selaginella are occasionally grown for ornamental purposes.Some eastern states in the United States have placed restrictions on the harvesting of Lycopsida from publicforests, because they are now endangered as a species due to heavy Christmas season haivests.Selaginella lepidophylla is a species of the dry regions from Mexico to Peru. and it often is sold under thename of resurrection plant. In very dry weather the plant is dormant and forms a grayish brown ball, but whenwatered, it unrolls to form an attractive green plant.Lycopodium spores, sold as lycopodium powder, are used in certain medications to form a bland coverand also to provide a natural bulk in laxatives (they absorb large volumes of water). They have also been usedin the past as flash powder in the making of explosives.Perhaps the major contribution of this group of plants derives from its extinct members. They were amongthe principal contributors to the vegetable deposits of the carboniferous period which were transformed intocoal. Cannel coal, which burns with a bright and nearly smokeless flame. is derived largely from the sporesof the Lycopsida and Sphenopsida.SphenopsidaThe horsetails, or scouring rushes (Equisetum) are the only living representative of the Sphenopsida. Horsetailstems are hollow and jointed, and the leaves are borne in whorls at the nodes. When branches are presentthey also are borne in whorls. The leaves are so insignificant that most photosynthetic activity is carried onby the stems. There is no camb'urn in the stems, and vascular bundles are arranged in a ring. The stems con-tain a high concentration of silica.Equisetum is homosporous, and the sporangia are borne on shield-like sporangiophores that are groupedin terminal strobili, like Selaginella. Spores fall on the ground and produce green photosynthetic prothalli witha number of erect green lobes. Both types of sex organ are produced on the same prothallus, and motile.spermbring about fertilization.Equisetum is a popular plant in rock gardens, and thrives in moist areas.PurposeThis laboratory is a descriptive exercise, similar to laboratories sixteen through eighteen. designed to in-troduce the student to the Special are several ways to collect a supply of Lycopodium for the laboratory, namely:a)If you live in an area where Lycopodium grows. collect it in the woods:b)If this laboratory is to be run during the Christmas season, many stores sell it as a decoration. FreshLycopodium, if stored in a cool, moist place, will keep for up to two months:c) Or, if necessary. Lycopodium can be purchased from biological supply houses.2) Equiseturn (horsetail) is easily grown in a garden. Once installed, it does not require particular careand will be available for observation over the years. Horsetails, also known as scouring rushes, are availablefrom local nurseries. They also grow wild in many areas.3) Psilotum (no common name) is also easily grown potted. Psilotum is available from nurseries and alsofrom biological supply houses.Time RequiredThe introduction to the club mosses and horsetails labor.. ;Dry requires one classroom hour, in additionto preparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need all listed supplies.StepsA.

LaboratorySurvey of the Ferns When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.List the distinguishing characteristics of the Filicophyta.2.Trace the alternation of generations in ferns and compare itwith life cycles.3.Compare homosporous and he42rosporous ferns. BackgroundAlthough many ferns are found in moist, shady areas. species of ferns grow in climates ranging from bar-ren deserts to the frozen arctic. There are more than ten thousand species, and they range in size from eightyfoot tall tree-ferns to microscopic plants. Ferns can be terrestrial, climbing. epiphytic, or even aquatic.Humans use ferns variously. Ferns are used to decorate at holiday times and to landscape. A drug derivedfrom a species of Dryopteris is a standard deworming medicine, especially used to expel tapeworm from theintestinal tract of man and other animals. In Asia. both Athyrium esculentum and Ceratopteris thalictroidesare commonly used as a green vegetable, both raw and cooked.Ferns can also be harmful. Pteridium aquilinum, bracken fern, is mildly poisonous to livestock. In someareas bracken fern forms a solid ground cover, taking over cleared, formerly productive grazing land. In Scotlandalone there are more than 400.000 acres dominated by bracken fern. Recent studies also indicate that oneof the reasons the Japanese suffer from an unusually :,.jh incidence of stomach cancer is that they regularlyeat bracken fronds.ClassificationFerns may be classified in seven distinct orders, four of which are extinct. Ferns all possess true roots,stems, and leaves, as do the more advanced Phanerophyta, but the ferns still reproduce by spores insteadof seeds. The Filicophyta share the distinction with the rest of their pteridophyte relatives of being more numerousin the.past than at present. The three modern orders are the Ophioglossale3, the Filicales, and the Marsileales.The Ophioglossales are commonly known as the adder's tongue ferns, and they are the most primitiveof the modern ferns. There are about 90 species of Ophioglossales. They differ from all other ferns in thattheir sporangia are borne on a fertile spike which projects Yom the upper surface of the leaf near the junctionof the blade and petiole. They are all eusporangiate. In eusporangiate ferns, the sporangium develops froma group of sporangial initial cells, just as in the more primitive club mosses. The jacket layer is more thanone cell thick at maturity, and there is no highly specialized mechanism of dispersal.The Filicales are known as the \"true- ferns, with being homosporous and leptosporangiate.In leptosporangiate ferns, the sporangium develops from a single sporangial initial cell. The jacket layer is onlyone cell thick at maturity, and spore dispersal is usually due to hygroscopic changes in a group of thick-walledcells which commonly form a partial or complete ring called the annulus. As the sporangium dries out at maturity,tension, develops within the annulus, which causes the sporangium 'to break along definite thin-walled celllines. There are more than 9000 species of Filicales. and the common bracken fern. Pteridium aquilinum ofthe class Polypodiaceae, is the one that is often studied in biology classes. 221 The Marsileales group of ferns has no common name. They are heterosporous, leptosporangiate fernswhich grow in water or wet places and are usually rooted to the substrate. People often do not realizethat they are ferns. Marsilea look somewhat like a floating four leaf clover and are commonly called waterclover. There are about 40 species of Marsi lea. and, typical of the group as a whole, they produce two kindsof spores in sporocarps. Sporocarps are modified folded leaves or leaf segments which hold the sporangiaof the plant.One class of the Marsileales, the Saluiniaceae, float on the surface of water instead of being attached. Theyinclude two genera. Saluinia and Azo 11a. Azo called duckweed fern. Duckweed fern has en-gendered a lot of scientific interest in recent years because of its remarkable symbiotic relationship with thenitrogen fixing blue-green alga Anabaena azollae. They grow together at the surface of streams and pondsthroughout tropical and temperate regions of the world. Like nitrogen fixing bacteria living inside the root nodulesof legumes. the relationship is mutually beneficial.Duckweed fern and its algal counterpart play an apparently important role in the fixation of nitrogen tothe benefit of both themselves and rice growing man. For centuries, Azolla has been used as green manurein some areas of China and in other Asian countries to fertilize rice paddies. Some authorities believe intensi-fied use of Azolla enabled the North Vietnamese to survive effects of the American blockade which disruptedimports of chemical fertilizer during the Vietnamese war.According to Wilson Clark, writing in \"China's Green Manure Revolution\", the People's Republic of l Tinahas 3.2 million acres of paddy seeded with Azo Ila. This provides at least 100.000 tons of natural nitrogen fertilizerper year. Additionally, it is suggested that rice production increases as much as 158% with Azolla. Expandeduse of Azolla could be an important factor in the world's future food supply. StructureThe fern is a vascular plant with roots, stems, and leaves. The stems are perennial, living from year toyear to produce new leaves each season. Excepting the tree-ferns, most fern stems are horizontal and growunderground. The root formed by the embryo does not persist and is soon replaced by many dark, wiry.adventitious roots which arise from the stem. Many ferns reproduce by vegetative means when creeping sterns,called rhizomes, branch.Fern leaves, called fronds, grow apically and begin in a coiled position which is called a fiddlehead. Ina few species the extended fern leaf can he up to one hundred feet long! Life CycleFern spores are produced from special structures called sporangia, either eusporangia or leptosporangia.Marsileales spores are borne in sporocarps. Clusters of sporangia are called sori and may be naked or coveredby an indusium.The gametophyte of ferns, as with other pteridophytes, is called a prothallus. The prothallus varies in sizeand shape in different kinds of ferns, but it is always small and inconspicuous. In eusporangiate ferns it is oftenthree to five centimeters long and many cells thick; but in leptosporangiate ferns the prothallus is usually thin,flat, and heart-shaped. seldom more than one centimeter long, and mostly only one cell layer thick. Rhizoids.antheridia. and archegonia are borne on the underside of the prothallus. with archegonia being closer to themiddle of the heart's \"notch\" than antheridia. These structures are similar to those of other pteridophytes.The life cycle of a fern follows the basic pattern shown in figure one. the outer circle are multicellular, those on the inner circle are unicellular.The \"meiosis\"and \"fertilization\" lines separate generations.Figure 1PurposeIn this laboratory you will observe key characteristics of typical ferns and trace their reproductive cycles so thatyou can compare them with other pteridophytes. You also specimens.Azolla some with soriSpecial Preparations1) Ferns are widely available from homes and gardens. local nurseries, garden clubs, universities. arboretae,and biological supply houses. Many will allow teachers to borrow the plants for a short period of time. Ferngametophytes are also available in the same manner. Maintain gametophytes in a moist environment, suchas in a terrarium.2)It may be necessary to purchase Marsilea with sporocarps and Azolla from biological supply houses,as they are not usually grown for decorative purposes. They are easily cultured and maintained in the class-room in aquaria.Time RequiredThe survey of the ferns laboratory requires one full classroom hour, in addition to a partial hour, pluspreparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need all listed supplies.StepsA.The sporophyte: examine available fern plants.1.

LaboratoryIntroduction to the Gymnosperms When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.List the distinguishing characteristics of the gymnosperms.2.List the cell types of typical gymnosperm leaf, tissue, and bark.3.Trace gymnosperm reproductive processes.4.Compare gymnosperm reproductive habits mosses. and mosses. BackgroundIn the plant division Phanerophyta three phyla, the Cycadophyta. the Coniferophyta, and theAnthophyta. The first two phyla are commonly known as the gymnosperms, or naked seed plants, and thethird phylum as the angiosperms. or protected seed plants. These phyla include the most modern plants andthose most commonly encountered. All reproduce with seeds.The seed bearing plants came into being during the Permian period (225 to 280 million years ago) whenthere were worldwide changes of climate which involved stressful extremes. Terrestrial plants and animalswere under strong selective pressures to evolve specialized structures which would make it possible for them tosurvive both freezing and drought. Just as amphibians gave way to scaly skinned lizards, so too did plantsthat reproduce with sperm and egg yield to seed plants. Some older forms remained, but seed plants becamedominant.In this laboratory you will investigate the two phyla of the time foryour MaterialsZamiaZamia seedThujaPin us edule seedpine with of small conesmature pine conesmacerated pine woodmacerated pine barkPin us nr Juniperus of of a trunk, cross cut sectionmodelling claytissuesSpecial Preparations 1)Plant specimens may be obtained from individuals, nurseries, local universities, garden clubs.or biological supply houses. People usually are delighted to contribute plants for instructional purposes.2) Pine materials may be obtained from the same sources or by taking a trip into the woods. Fail-ing all else, you can chop your Christmas tree into pieces. wrap it in plastic. and refrigerate it for upto six months.3) Wood sections should be cut in three planes, transversely. radially, and tangentially.Time RequiredThe introduction to the gymnosperms laboratory requires four classroom hours, in addition topreparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the following supplies: microscope, dissecting scope. slides, coverslips, watch glasses.probe. forceps. razor, Gingko and Zamia seed. The CycadophytaThe cycads are gymnosperms with fern-like, usually large and pinnately compound leaves. The seeds areborne on modified megasporophylls (large, spore bearing leaves) which are usually arranged in a terminal cone.The stem has a large pith, a well developed cortex, and scanty vascular tissue. The stems are usually unbranched.All modern cycads belong to one order, the Cycadales. andthey are found only in tropical and sub-tropicalregions of the world. There are three more, now extinct orders, in which one can trace the evolution of cycadsfrom the ferns. One order, in fact, is known as the \"seed ferns7In this laboratory hour, you will investigate the cycads and the Gingko. the most primitive of moderngymnosperms.StepsThe SporophyteA. Examine specimen plants of representative cycads. such as Zamia.1. How might the plant parts be described? 236 2. From observation of these plants, can you draw conclusions about their rate of growth? How? 3.In what ways are these plants fern-like2 4. What characteristics of the plant suggest structures suitable for arid climates? B. Study the prepared slides of vegetative structures of cycads with a microscope.5. What additional fern-like characteristics do you see with the microscope? 6 What characteristics are different from most modern ferns') C. Amin plants produce strobili at the apex of the stem. Either a staminate or an ovulate cone is borneat the stem tip. Study representative Zamia plants. 7.If the axis is to increase in length after cone production. where would this growth occur? S. Compare ovulate and staminate strobili. the position. number of sporangia. D In seed plants. the megasporangium usually is cloaked by one or two additional layers of tissue. Theselayers are called integuments. The megasporangium with integuments is called an ovule. The microsporophyllof Zarnia and other seed plants is commonly called a stamen. Study slides of the reproductive structuresof Zamia. 237,15r., The Male Gametophyte9. Microspores are produced in microsporangia and immediately germinate. Once multicellular, they arebeyond the stage of being spores. Why? 10. What are these structures? 11. Study the prepared slide of sporangia containing germinated rnicrospores. How many cells constitute thesporangia? 12. The male gametophyte is shed from the microsporangium before sperms are produced. At this stage itis called a pollen grain. What is the significance of the male gametophyte being enclosed within the spore wall? 13. How could the pollen grains reach ovulate cones? 14. What term is applied to the process of pollen transfer?15. Why is this process considered very different from the process of fertilization? 16. Why are the two processes so generally confused' The Female Gametophyte17. In each ovule, only one cell produces meiospores. How many spores would be produced in each ovule? 18. Only one megaspore functions in producing a gametophyte. Since the spore is not shed from the sporan-gium, what relationship does the female gametophyte bear to the sporophyte? 238 E. Examine the ovules on Zamia plants containing mature female gametophytes.19. How large are the gametophytes2 20. The archegonia are large enough to see without a microscope. They are small, pocket-like structures at ,one end of the starchy gametophyte. Why are they at the end nearest the place where the ovule is attachc,19 21. What is the fleshy coat of the ovule?22. Is this fleshy coat completely closed?23. An opening in the integument is called the micropyle. How close to the archegonia could pollen be broughtby wind or insects? FertilizationThe pollen grain is brought in contact with the megasporangium by evaporation or withdrawal of a \"polli-nation drop\" (a drop of liquid exuded through the micropyle). In contact with the megasporangium, the malegametophyte grows into the megasporangium. The cells of the megasporangium are digested partially by thepollen tubes. forming a pollen chamber in the apical region. and the male gametophyte gradually drops downclose to the archegonia. The remnants of the tissue of the megasporangium collapse over the chamber. Twolarge multiciliate sperms are produced by each male gametophyte.24. What liquid would be present for swimming sperms? The union of sperm and egg results in the formation of a zygote. More than one zygote may be formedin an ovule.Seed FormationF. Examine seeds of Zamia.25. Of what structures does the seed consist? 26. What are the gametophyte, andembryo sporophyte? 239.1 7 27. What functional specialization is accomplished by the formation of pollen and the process of pollination? 28. Compare cycad seeds with the seed-like development in Selaginella. studied in laboratory nineteen. GingkoG. Study both plants and prepared slides of Gingko, the maidenhair tree (named because its leaves resemblethose of the maidenhair fern).29. What comparisons can be made between Gingko and Zamia2 Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following supplies: prepared pine slides. pine branches, trunk slab section. microscope.slides, coverslips. dissecting scope. razor. saw, and tissues.ConiferophytaConiferous forests are best known as a source of lumber. ground cover. and occasional poetic inspiration.Although there are less than four hundred species in the phylum Coniferophyta. they constitute a significantpercentage of the world's biomass. Their only serious competitors in the temperate regions of the world aredeciduous angiosperms. And conifers dominate in sub-arctic regions. In the remaining three hours of this laboratory, consider how the form and function of the conifers contribute to their great success.The conifers are quite variable. The following need to be considered during your studies of them. 1)Exactly what is meant by the term evergreen?2) What is a particular species' general form. type of branching. size. and life span?3) What type of leaves does it have shape. size. arrangement. persistence. etc.?4) Does the species have \"short shoots.\" and what are they like? 240 5) What is the position, persistence, structure, and bract-scale complex of its ovulate cones?6) What are the number, position, and form of its seeds?7) What type of branching system does it use to maximize photosynthetic possibilities?Gametophyte structures in all conifers are similar, but times involved in reproduction are variable from speciesto species. For your laboratory investigation, you will use Pinus as an illustrative form, partly because it is familiarand easy to obtain, and partly because it is the \"classical\" form against which other genera are compared.You will consider the vegetative details of the sporophyte. You are to visualize the cells, tissues, and organs.three dimensionally. You will be asked to show your instructor that you can visualize in three dimensions'bymaking perspective drawings and clay models. You also will consider the structures. timing. and sequencinginvolved in sexual reproduction. You will be asked to make comparisons between gymnosperms.In this laboratory hour you will investigate the anatomy of gymnosperms.StepsStem StructureA. The stem of a pine is made of several tissues composed of different cell types. Microscopically examinestem cross sections. both in the prepared slide and a slide that you have made.30. List the charactersitics by which you can identify the different cell types seen in the stem cross section. B. The cells not only are representative of tissue types but also are restricted to rather definite zones. Cuta stem transversely with a razor blade. Examine the cut surface.31. What common terms are used to describe a stern's visible zones? 32. Compare the common terms for structures seen with the naked eye, as listed in question thirty-one. witha stem cross section studied microscopically. as in step A. Which of the major zones is most complex in structure? The center of the stem is composed of cells nearly round in cross section. The cells are not widely variableand are thin-walled. The zone is called pith. and the tissue composing the pith is called parenchyma.Next to the pith is a zone of angular empty celled tissue, the wood. or xylem.33. Are the xylem cells empty?34. Are they all thick-walled? 241..1 35. Are there any differences in cell shape in the xylem?The rows of cells elongated along radii of the stem constitute wood rays or xylem rays. The heavy walled.empty. angular c-Ils are tracheids.36. Which type of cell is oriented vertically in the stem? 37. How can you determine that tracheids are rather long cells? The large intercellular spaces. surrounded by thin-walled living cells, are the resin canals. The cellssurrounding the canals are the secretory cells.The bark, composed of all the tissues outside the xylem. is the most complex zone. It is composed ofseveral tissues and in older stems can be divided into zones of live bark and dead bark.Most of the xylem is in radial rows because it is derived from successive r.,itoses of a ring of cells calledthe cambium. The cambium zone can be fairly well delimited at the edge of x, :' Since xylem cells graduallymature from new cells produced by the cambium, there is not a sharp demarcation of the cambium.External to the cambium is a layer of phloem.38. Do rows of ray cells continue from xylem through the phloem?39. Are there other phloem cells arranged in radial rows which correspond to the rows of xylem cells?40. Since cambium is in line with both xylem and phloem, how can this arrangement explained? In the phloem are slender, angular. nearly empty cells called sieve cells. There are also broader, shortercells called phloem parenchyma cells, and the radial series of cells composing the phloem rays.Outside the phloem are large. thin-walled cells similar to the cells of pith. This tissue is parenchyma, andthe zone is the cortex.41. Are there resin canals in the cortex?The surface of young stems is covered by a single row of cells, the epidermis. In older sterns. an outerlayer, the periderm, is usually produced from the epidermis. The periderm is several cells thick and consists.in part, of cork tissue.42. Does the specimen supplied have an epidermis? What is the evidence for an epidermis? (If necessary.check this with your instructor.) 242 dr\"...(I 0 C. Compare the stern section with a slab cut from a trunk.43. What tissue areas increase more as the stem grows into a trunk? 44. What special markings distinguish live bark from dead bark? 45.

What are the basis for identifying each cell type? D. Examine macerated pine bark, both with the naked eye and with the microscope.55. What bark cells can you identify.' 56.If you were to examine bark materials, how would you determine if it were adulterated by wood? E. Examine pine leaves, both live and with prepared slide cross sections under a microscope.57. Sketch and label pine leaf cell types in the space provided below, using separate drawings for each celltype as you did for stem tissues. (You should have sketched the following Diagram a cross Zection of a pine leaf in figure three below, showing areas of each tissue. Figure 3Procedure: Hour 4Students need the following supplies: pine branch, pine cones, Pinus edule seed, microscope, slides,coverslips. tissues. razor. probe. and prepared slides of pine germinating microspores and pine ovules.In this laboratory hour you will investigate the reproductive process in conifers.StepsStaminate StrobiliA. Examine a pine branch with leaves and clusters of modified leaves. or small cones.59. What evidence is there that each cone represents a branch? 247 60. What are the structures composing each cone'? 61. How many sporangia occur on each microsporophyll (stamen)?62. How does the position of the sporangia compare with that in ferns? 63. How does the position of the sporangia compare with that in the Lycopsida? B. Microscopically examine the contents of the sporangia by crushing a stamen in water.64. Pollen grains are composed of how many cells?65. Pine pollen grains are usually winged. The wings are not cells but represent air sacs within the cell wall.What evidence is there to support this statement? 66. Are the sporangia dorsal? What evidence can you cite for your answer? 67. How many cells are in mature pollen grains?68. Why is the term pollen grain not just another term for a microspore2 69. What other term could be used for a germinated rnicrospore?70. Under what circumstances would pollen be shed from the sporangia) 248 Ovulate StrobiliD. Examine the pine branch again. Small cones are produced near the tips of branches. There may beone to four, depending on species, produced on any one branch. Also examine single. mature cones.71. What difference in appearance is there between staminate and ovulate cones' 72. When pollen is shed from the microsporophylls. how can it be brought to the ovulate cones'? At pollination time, the megasporangium with a tubular jacket (integument) has not produced megaspores.The megasporangium with its integument is called an ovule.74.If there is a space between the ovulate cone scales. how close to the ovules could pollen grains be carried? Following pollination, the male gametophyte continues growth and penetrates the wall of the megasporan-gium. The megasporangium develops a single tetrad of spores. and only one megaspore germinates.75. When the megaspore germinates, what structure would be produced? Gametes are produced the spring following pollination. The sperm cells (microgametes) are produced ina tubular outgrowth from the pollen grain. The eggs (megagametes) are produced singly in archegonia at theedge of the female gametophyte. Fusion occurs after a sperm cell from the pollen tube is discharged into thearc hegonium .76. What changes occur in the cone during the year between pollination and fertilization'? 77. What is the relationship between the female gametophyte. the sporangium. and the plant bearing thesporangium? 78. When the zygote germinates, what will it produce?-.249,-- -,- a i 79. What relationship does the new sporophyte have with the:gametophyte?sporangium?inteaument?parent sporophyte?The SeedAccompanying the growth of the young sporophyte. the strobilus continues to enlarge.. At maturity, theovule and its contents are called a seed.80. Where are seeds borne in the mature pine cones? 81. How many seeds are produced on each cone scale?E. Dissect a Pinus edule seed. The blunt end of the seed is the region of attachment to the cone scale.The somewhat pointed end is the micropylar end, or. the micropyle (the region where the integument is openand where pollen grains came in contact with the ovule.82. Draw in the space provided below the dissected seed and show its observable parts. Indicate the probableposition of the archegonium in relation to the formation of the embryo.

When pine seeds germinate, what structures of the embryo become prominently enlarged? 88. How can you distinguish cotyledons and foliage leaves? 89. What happens to the tissue of the gametophyte which forms part of the seed? 90. What are the principle differences between pines and ferns in method and structures of reproduction? The structure of ovulate cones in conifers is as variable as the habit of the plants themselves. In this labora-tory, pine was used only as illustrative material. Other genera may produce seeds in one year or less. Theprocedure in all cases is similar. In the cycads and Gingko. swimming sperms are released into the archegonialchamber. In the conifers, the sperm cell does not swim but is carried to the egg by growth of the pollen tube.Additional Summary Questions and ReviewThe following summary and activities may be considered as a post-laboratory summary. You may want toconsider outside resource materials in addition to your class notes and text. 251 (,r,., U i SummaryConifers are represented by plants ranging in size from toThe usual habit of the trees is The leaves range in size fromto and may be arranged in several ways.viz. Some conifers retain leaves for several years and are commonly referred to as evergreen. Others losetheir leaves annually and are said to be Where branchesare of distinct kinds, rate of groWth often distinguishes them. Slow growing branches or branches of limitedgrowth are called In pine. these branches of limited growthmay produce a number of leaves characteristic of the species. This number varies fromtoin the several species.Reproductive branches are in the form of cones or strobili.

The Immune SystemThe immune system is key to the survival of vertebrates. for without it death from infection would be certain.The components of the immune defense network maintain constant surveillance against foreign invaders. Thesystem is able to recognize an almost limitless variety of foreign cells and substances and to mobilize againstthem. Special cells in the immune system carry the memory of each infection so that a re-exposure is coun-tered almost immediately. The system functions to recognize, selectively eliminate. and remember each typeof foreign invader. .It is now recognized as a major body system. along with the circulatory. nervous. muscu-lar, skeletal, digestive. endocrine, excretory. and reproductive systems. Immune ResponsesThere are two forms of immune response in the human body. The cellular immune response. based onspecial cells sensitive to foreign cells and molecules. generally fights against larger foreign substances suchas cancer cells. fungi. and multicellular parasites. The humoral immune response. based on antibodies presentin blood and other body fluids. specializes against bacteria and viruses which have not yet invaded body cells.The two immune responses can act in tandem in the blood or lymphatic systems of the body. LymphocytesThe primary cells of the immune system are small white blood cells called lymphocytes. Lymphocytes.like other blood cells. are produced in ancestral. or stem. cells in bone marrow. Two types of lymphocyteshave been identified in humans. B and T. The 13 lymphocytes complete their maturation within bone marrow.The T lymphocytes migrate from bone marrow to the thymus. where they are further differentiated. B andT lymphocytes are similar in size and appearance. but their immunological roles are different. 257 B LymphocytesB lymphocytes manufacture antibodies. Antibodies are immunoglobulin proteins produced in response tospecific antigens. Their functions include toxins, agglutinating bacteria or cells, and precipitatingsoluble antigens. Antigens are any protein or carbohydrate which stimulates an immune response and theproduction of antibodies. When most individuals respond the same negative way to a substance, it is calleda disease; when only a few experience an immune response. it is called an allergy.Sir Macfarlane Burnet, an Australian microbiologist, developed the clonal selection theory of immunologywhich generally explains the basic mode of B lymphocyte action. According to the clonal selection theory.as each B cell matures in the bone marrow, it becomes commited to the synthesis of antibodies which recognizea specific antigen. or molecular pattern. The molecular pattern which the antibody recognizes on an antigenis called the epitope. In the simplest case, the descendants of each such cell retain the same specificity, andthey thus form a clone of immunologically identical cells.A B cell's antibodies stay bound to the cell membrane, where they are displayed on the surface as receptormolecules. When and if an antigen binds to an antibody in the membrane, the cell is stimulated to proliferate.This is called the process of clonal selection. Many different clones can respond to a single infection. The antigenmarkers can be very small patterns of molecular structure, and a single virus or bacterium carries many suchpatterns. Complement ProteinsAntibody molecules do not directly destroy a foreign invader: they mark it for destruction by other defensemechanisms. One of these mechanisms is comprised of complement proteins, or enzymes. Complement proteinsconsist of at least eleven different proteins circulating in the body. Their attacks on invaders are triggered byantibodies attaching themselves to the cell membranes of bacteria, protozoa. or tumor cells.When stirred into action by the binding of immunoglobulin to antigen, complement proteins attach to thecell membrane and cause it to burst. Because they are not altered or used up by the process. these complementproteins can be considered a special type of enzyme.A second defense mechanism consists of phagocytic cells moving in the circulatory system which recognizeand consume antibody marked substances. A third way antibodies work in defense is to coat or combine withan invader and interfere with one of its vital functions. No further action by complement proteins or phagocytesis necessary, since the act of binding with the particle de-natures it. For example. when an antibody combineswith a virus it prevents it from invading a host cell. Antibody DiversityA virus or bacterium has many different epitopes, or centers for antibody attachment. Antibodies can beformed for each different epitope on the invading organism, and although one antibody is sufficient to controlan invader, the body usually produces a polyclonal. or more than one antibody. reaction. Each different anti-body comes from a separate B lymphocyte which produces a unique antibody.One mouse can produce an estimated billion different antibodies. A single antigen may elicit several thousanddifferent antibodies. Antiserum effective against even a single antigen is almost impossible to duplicate. Theuse of conventional immune serum, because of polyclonal responses. can have unforseen side effects. Minorcontaminants in the serum may cause untoward allergic reactions. Even highly specific antibodies can exhibitheterogeneity and cross reactivity, and they are available only in limited quantities. 2586 T LymphocytesIt is more difficult to classify and to describe T cells than B cells. Most T cells do not recognize freely circulatingantigens. and they respond to an antigen on a cell surface only under particular conditions. The foreign invadermust be in the process of invading a host cell before there is a T cell response. For an immune response tooccur, the antigen receptor on the surface of a T cell must simultaneously recognize the antigen and the hostcell protein.There are four types of T lymphocytes and four T responses. The cytotoxic. or killer T cells destroy targetedinvader cells without further assistance. The other three types of T cells variously modulate the immune responseby secreting messenger proteins or by directly contacting cells under attack. One of these three is referred toas an inducer T cell because it triggers the maturation of T lymphocytes from precursor forms into functionallydistinct cells. The so-called helper T cells. once they recognize an antigen. stimulate other components of theimmune system, including B cells and other T cells specific for the same antigen. The final type. suppressorT cells. diminish the activities of all other lymphocytes. thus permitting the body to return to a normal state.While the term helper T cell implies a subsidiary role in the immune system. the opposite in fact may betrue. Some believe that helper T cells might b 1 master switches for the entire immune system. The suppressorT cells might be equally important. for they provide the negative feedback vital to making the immune responseself-limiting.Self, Nonself, and ToleranceSince B and T lymphocytes react to foreign invaders, a critical question is how they recognize foreignsubstances. The English immunologist Peter B. Medawar in 1953 attempted to answer this question by takinglymphoid cells from one variety of adult mouse and injecting them into newborn mice of another variety. At eightto ten weeks of age he grafted skin from the original adult mice onto the younger mice, as well as skin froma third strain of mice. The younger mice accepted the skin, of the original adult mice as their own but rejectedthe skin of the third mouse strain. These results showed that immunological tolerance, acceptance of a substanceas part of self. was induced by exposure to the antigen early in the development of the newborn mice.If a substance ceases to be produced in the body. the body (via the lymphocytes) ceases to regard thesubstance as part of itself. This reaction is called clonal deletion. If the body resumes production of the sub-stance. the lymphocytes react to the substance as foreign and move against it. eliciting a full-fledged autoimmune.or self allergy. disease.Edward Triplett in 1962 at the University of California removed the pituitary glands of frog embryos andstored them under the skin of other young frog embryos. Later. when the original owners had matured. Triplettreturned their pituitaries to them. whereupon the glands were rejected. If any piece of the original pituitaryhad been left in place, the returned gland was not rejected. The immune system's knowledge of self and nonselfis an important key to an organism's defense system. Edward Triplett studied self-nonself identification andorgan transplant rejection in frogs. Today medical researchers are studying human organ transplants and con-sidering methods to suppress immune system attacks until a new organ has established itself in the recipient's body.Immune System DisordersAutoimmune DiseasesSometimes the immune system's recognition of self and nonself fails, and lymphocytes react against self.Once stimulated into production. they can perpetuate and wreck considerable damage upon the body. Amongthe autoimmune (self-directed) diseases of humans. in which components of the body are attacked by its ownimmune system, are juvenile-onset diabetes. lupus c rythernatosus. multiple sclerosis. myasthenia gravis, rheumaticfever, rheumatoid arthritis, several types of anemia, and ulcerative colitis. 25q 1-U Quite simply. different parts of the body are targeted by lymphocytes for destruction. In lupus erythematosusantibodies attack the skin, in myasthenia gravis antibodies attack neuromuscular junctions, multiple sclerosisattacks are centered in the brain and spinal column. in rheumatic fever antibodies attack the heart, in rheuma-toid arthritis the bones and joints are under seige, and in ulcerative colitis it is the colon. Autoimmune diseasesmay attack almost every known part of the body. from muscles to the thyroid. Doctors can mask the symptomsof autoimmune diseases, but there is no cure, unless the body somehow cures itself. That seldom has beenknown to happen.The Rh FactorHemolytic anemia, which results from Rh incompatibility between mother and child, can be a serious problemfor newborn babies. The human baby acquires antibodies from its mother during its last month in the uterus.Most of these antibodies are beneficial. The exception is the Rh factor, which is a genetically determined substancefound on the surface of red blood cells. If an Rh negative woman carries a child who is Rh positive, her bloodstream will form antibodies against the blood of the Rh positive child. The first born child generally escapeswithout serious damage, but the antibodies against Rh positive blood persist in the mother. In each subsequentpregnancy the mother's immune system attacks more vigorously the fetal bloodstream, and the mother's bloodcan seriously harm or kill the nearly full-term child.Now that the causes of hemolytic anemia are known. Rh disease can be suppressed by injecting the mother.within seventy-two hours of any abortion or live birth, with antibodies against the fetal Rh red blood cells stillin her system. This destroys the remnant fetal cells and prevents the triggering of antibody production. Subsequentpregnancies will be at no greater risk than the first.Another immune system problem for some women is the build up of antibodies against their husband'ssperm. These react to the sperm as foreign invaders and destroy them before conception can occur. Sincethe reaction is cumulative, the couple may have one or two children before the problem becomes obvious. AllergiesPeople are routinely exposed to environmental antigens, such as pollen, food, animal parts. or dust. Insome people, there is an allergic reaction caused by inhaling, eating, or touching foreign substances. Althoughthe antigen itself may present no danger to the individual, an excessive immune response does present a problem.either in terms of discomfort or, in extreme cases, death.An allergic response builds over time. The antigen causes a response in the immune system. Lymphocytememory cells are produced, and the next time the antigen is encountered. the antibody response is muchstronger. Eventually the antigen can be met with such a strong antibody response that the body may fatallyoverreact. In fatal bee stings the reaction is generalized throughout the body. Blood vessels dilate (under theinfluence of histamine) in an inflammatory response, others constrict. blood is misdirected. shock follows, andthen death.Other well known allergic reactions include hay fever where airborne pollens or dust cause reactions innasal passages, and asthma where the reaction is centered in the lungs. Food allergies can produce symptomsthat affect the intestines or produce skin rashes. In serious cases. food substances may be absorbed into theblood steam and cause a general reaction, at times life threatening.Antihistamines. which counteract the histamine effect, suppress some of the symptoms of an allergic response.Steroid hormones are also effective in some severe cases. Again, as with autoimmune diseases. medicalresearchers are still at the point of treating the symptoms. .not effecting a cure or preventing the syndrome. 260 Cancer, Viruses, and the Immune SystemWhen body cells mutate into something other than the role they were genetically destined to play, as inthe case of cancer, it is appropriate that the body's defense system mount an all out attack against these deviantcells. The transformation of a normal cell in to a cancer cell may begin in many ways, and such triggeringmechanisms are under medical study throughout the world. We know that nuclear changes can be inducedby infection with viruses, particularly the retroviruses. Retroviruses are mostly oncogenic, or tumor inducingviruses. The retroviruses are RNA viruses which are dependent upon cellular DNA synthesis for growth. Whenthey transform a cell, the transformation is genetically stable, so that a single cell will produce a clone of cancercells. This yields the tumor.Cell membrane changes also occur in cancer cells. Cell membrane changes transform the cancer cell intoan invasive cell with no restraints on growth. Cancer tumors are malignant, in that they invade surroundingtissues and spread to other parts of the body. This metastasis occurs in two stages. First, cancer cells invadesurrounding tissues, and then they enter the circulatory system. The sequence is the same for most cancers,including leukemia, which begins in bone marrow, although some cancers act much faster than others.Cell membrane changes in cancer cells also yield a positive side effect. Once the cell membrane has changed,the immune system normally is able to identify these cells as nonself, form antibodies against them, and destroythem. As early as 1908 the German microbiologist Paul Ehrlich suggested that cancer might in fact be a verycommon occurrence but that most people possessed an immune system which routinely is able to detect anddestroy deviant cells. This logically suggests that all cancers fundamentally represent failures of the immune system.Very recently Leo Sachs of the Weizmann institute of Science in Israel demonstrated that it is even possibleto reverse the malignancy of a cell by altering its environment. The medical applications of this discovery arepotentially considerable.AIDSAIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a retrovirus caused fatal disease. Like most retroviruses,the AIDS virus changes the nuclear structure of a cell. Often AIDS victims die of a previously rare cancer,Kaposi's sarcoma, a cancer of blood vessel linings. Also, like many other viruses in this group, the AIDS virusproduces a lasting depression of the immune response. It destroys T lymphocytes. As a consequence, AIDSpatients may eventually die from any number of minor and normally not fatal infections.The depression of the immune system in AIDS has parallels in other viral infections. For example, Clemensvon Pirquet in 1908 noted that measles temporarily weakens immunity. Von Pirquet found that people whohave been exposed to tuberculosis, and normally show positive with a tuberculin skin test, lose that skin reactivityfor a period of time after having had measles. Another example is the common and generally correct beliefthat a bout with the flu often leaves an individual in a weakened condition and susceptible to other communicablediseases. However, retroviruses differ from other groups of viruses in that they produce a permanent depres-sion of the immune system. .AIDS not only depresses the immune system, it eventually destroys it. AIDS viruses, like some other viralgroups. initially fight off the immune system by frequently mutating, causing antigen-specific immune responsesti miss the mark. This is called anti-genetic drift, and it is the reason why antibodies extracted from the bloodof AIDS patients are ineffective against the virus.Cell Tissue CultureSome readers may be asking how the preceding pages relate to the title of this. discussion \"Hybridomasand Monoclonal Antibodies.\" It is a good question, but before attempting an explicit answer, it is necessaryto provide one more facet of the story, the matter of cell tissue culture. And this story can begin with an Englishman,H. B. Wilson, who is 1907 decided to take a leisurely lunch after a full morning in his laboratory. At the timehe was studying sponges. and, wanting to perform experiments on individual cells, he forced a sponge throughcheese cloth, which caused the sponge cells to separate. Upon his return from the leisurely lunch, somethingvery startling had occurred. The sponge had reformed into a complete organism. 261t1 /1 Wilson repeated the experiment several times. including separating two types of sponges and mixing thetwo cell types together. He fo-und that the sponge cells sorted themselves out and still reformed two typesof sponges. These experiments led Wilson to a lifetime of sponge studies and caused other scientists to concludethat sponges are colonial creatures. not true multicellular organisms. Wilson's experiments were simply notedas an oddity peculiar to sponges and the subject generally dropped by the scientific community.Even though Wilson's experiments did not receive the attention they merited, they did stimulate some scientiststo wonder how cells of true multicellular organisms could be induced to grow separately in live cultures.Wilson had mechanically dissociated sponge cells. Finally, in 1916. Rous and Jones successfully dissociatedcells chemically. They used partially purified trypsin powder to chemically dissociate cells growing from tissuefragments explanted in plasma clots. They demonstrated that the freed cells could then be subcultured in freshplasma. It was the first time that anyone had successfully grown cells of a true multicellular organism outsidethat organism. In Vitro SystemsRoss Harrison in 1929 was able to standardize in vitro tissue culture, that is, he was able to grow varioustissues which reproduced and lived outside source organisms. Harrison still later pioneered work with polioviruses by growing the virus in vitro in monkey kidney cells. By the 1940's investigators were separating andculturing many types of tissues through various in vitro techniques. In vitro culture systems proved to be aturning point in virology studies, for they provided a means to study viruses outside a living organism.The first cell lines of classic human malignancies were being cultured by the end of WWII. In vitro systemsallow study of a cell isolated from other influences. cellular or otherwise. They permit control of the physicalenvironment (pH. ter-perature. pressure. etc.) in which a cell grows. They also offer the opportunity to clonecells, while providing a measure of genetic control and uniform:4-y of the population under study. In vitro cellsystems. in addition to cancer. viral, and bacterial studies. can be used in medical research for chromosomalstudies. cell fusion procedures. and investigations into the molecular bases of genetic disorders.Cells growing in vitro have special culture requirements. as they are extremely sensitive and perishable.For example. culture vessels must be non-toxic, and only de-mineralized, de-ionized, distilled water can beused. In addition, cells normally cannot proliferate unless they can attach to a substratum. which in some casescan be the plastic or glass container in which they are being cultured. An exception is cancer cells which donot require attachments. The medium must be carefully defined, so that any changes are attributable to theculture alone. Despite all these, and still other necessary precautions, there is a high frequency of abnormalcells, due to the unnatural environment in in vitro systems. This is characteristic of cells in culture.Fibroblastic and Epithelial CellsThere are two basic growth patterns in multicellular, proliferating cells. In one type of cell pattern. fibroblas-tic, the cells grow oriented to each other, normally in a single layer due to a factor called migration inhibition.which discourages them from growing on top of one another. Due to contact inhibition, they stop growingwhen they have no more room to spread in the culture vessel.The other type, epithelial cells. maintain strong contacts, called junctions, between cells. They thus tendto grow in packets or clusters until they fill the entire culture vessel. Culture PatternsCellular aggregation patterns can be altered by factors other than whether the cell's growth pattern is fibroblasticor epithelial. Age, health, and medium characteristics all play a role. The normal adhesive tendencies of cellscan be inhibited mechanically by maintaining the culture in a rotating flask. Aggregation also can be affectedchemically by changing the concentration of solutions used as nutrients for a cell culture. 262 Individual cells proliferate at a rate similar to what might have occurred in the source organism. For example,in a mixed culture, brain cells do not proliferate, bone and blood cells increase slowly, but fibroblasts, becauseof their wound healing properties. increase rapidly, just as they do in the source organism. Therefore, as amixed culture continues through the generations, certain types of cells become increasingly less common. Neuralcells do not replicate and eventually disappear, whereas neural connector cells called filial cells undergo mitosisand maintain a presence within a mixed culture.When a cell turns cancerous. culture patterns change radically. Cancerous cells do not depend on attachmentto a substratum, they clump together. and their growth is unchecked. In laboratory settings they spread to theouter limits of the culture's nutrient solution.Characteristics of culture pattern will be used in the following laboratory to distinguish cell types.The Aging ProcessHayflick and Morehead. in the late 1950's and early 1960's. monitored cell reproductive processes by culturinghuman fetal lung tissue. They discovered that cells in culture have a finite life span. After fifty doublings, humanfetal lung tissue stops proliferation. The growth curve becomes flat and eventually turns down. If hydroCorti-sone is added to the culture, proliferation can be expanded, but not indefinitely. The culture ages and, in essence.dies. However, if the human fetal lung tissue cells had been cancerous. they would have continued to growendlessly. as if they were immortal.Hybridoma and Monoclonal AntibodiesHybridomasAn important breakthrough in cell culture was achieved in the mid-1970's by Cesar Milstein, an Argentinean.and Georges Kohler, a Swiss, conducting research in Cambridge. England. Milstein and KOhler. in commonwith other researchers working on antibodies at the time, had difficulties because of the body's production ofa complex mixture of antibodies, making it almost impossible to separate specific antibodies for study. Milsteinand Kohler searched for a method to produce. isolate, and purify specific antibodies.Milstein and Kohler applied the knowledge that cancer cells are immortal in culture. They separated andcultured myelomas. a bone marrow cancer. which they hoped might be compatible with the lymphocytes whichproduce the antibodies they were studying. Using a newly developed technique, they fused the cancerousmyeloma cells with the target lymphocytes. The result was immortal cells which produce antibodies even inthe absence of antigens. They were able to fuse these two different cells because of the discovery that polyethyleneglycol, abbreviated PEG, causes cell membranes to lose their individual identity markers. They had combineda normal lymphocyte with a myeloma and had produced a hybrid immortal cell which makes specific anti-bodies. They termed this new cell a hybridoma. It was a discovery worthy of the Nobel Prize. Now specificantibodies can be produced in sufficient quantities for both research and medical applications.Cloning HybridomasCloning hybridomas is done as follows. An animal is inoculated with an antigen to trigger lymphocyte andantibody production. Later, a blood sample is taken and a mixture of lymphocytes is extracted from the blood.Next, the lymphocytes are fused with myeloma cells from a single tumor. The mixture of hybridomas is thenallowed to proliferate (clone) in separate little wells (tiny petri dishes). Each dish is tested for antigen-antibodyreactions. This sifting process is greatly facilitated today by computer-aided chemical analysis. whereas Milsteinand .Kohler culled their tiny dishes manually.Positive dishes are separated from the rest. The dishes are again cloned and tested further for specific reactions.From literally thousands of little dishes researchers are fortunate to find a single. pure hybridoma culture whichproduces a desired antibody. It is similar to searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack. Rare finds arethose which produce monoclonal antibodies, or uniform antibodies from a single clone of cells. Once isolatedthe monoclonal antibody producing hybridoma can be multiplied indefinitely by cell tissue culture to supplythe world's needs for that particular antibody. Such potentially profitable isolations are now patented. 263 Monoclonal AntibodiesMonoclonal antibodies are ideal for the study of antibody chemistry. and with sufficient volumes of anti-body now available. they are used to extend our knowledge in other areas. such as cell membrane specificityand tissue typing. Researchers now are able to explore the possibility of passive immunization, in which peoplewould be vaccinated with a specific antibody rather than with an antigen. as now done, which causes a patientto develop their own antibodies. Until the monoclonal antibody technique, large quantities of pure. specificantibodies were unavailable for this procedure.The medical benefits of monoclonal antibody production are just now beginning to accrue. and the poten-tialities are enormous. Researchers now have volumes of pure antibodies which yield consistent results.Cell LinesIn the United States, the Hybridoma Cell Bank. supported by the National Institute of Allergy and InfectiousDiseases. began operation in October 1980. The principal aim of the bank is to collect hybridoma cell linessecreting monoclonal antibodies. Groups and individuals may deposit cell. lines for preservation and storage.Researchers from around the world may then order the cell lines they wish to investigate. The cell bank checkscultures for contamination with mycoplasmas and bacteria and for species identification. It also performs analyticalisoelectric focusing in flat-bed thin layer agarose gels on the cultures submitted.The American Type Culture CollectionThe Hybridoma Cell Bank is only one section of the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) locatedin Bethesda. Maryland. It was the first approved international depository under the Budapest Treaty for theInternational Recognition of the Deposit of Microorganisms for the Purposes of Patent Procedures. Also. Americanand European patent organizations consider the ATCC as a legal depository for patent verification.At present. one can only speculate as to what the eventual industrial. medical. and research impact ofhybridomas and monoclonal antibodies might be. It is. however, certain to be substantial.ResourcesHakomori. Sen-itoh. \"Glycosphingolipids: Scientific American. May 1986.Jaret. Peter. Our Immune System: the Wars Within: National Geographic.

LaboratoryCreating a Heterokaryon When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Demonstrate asceptic technique in cell tissue culture.2.Fuse two different cell lines with polyethylene glycol.3.Create a heterokaryon.4.Identify and describe the new cells. PurposeTwo stages are required for cells to fuse. In the first stage the cell membranes integrate, and the cellularcytoplasms fuse. A cell in this first stage of fusion is called a heterokaryon. Many heterokaryons exist naturally.such as binucleate and coenor:ytic algae. In the second stage the two nuclei within the cytoplasm fuse. Afterthis stage of complete fusion :he cell is called a hybridoma, as discussed in the last unit.In this six day laboratory you will force cells to physically fuse. and you will observe this through thefirst stage of fusion. You will create a new living organism. a heterokaryon. You will be able to observeit functioning and reproducing. If you were to maintain the culture over several weeks, you might seesome of the heterokaryon cells become true hybrids or hybridomas.Two cell lines have been chosen for this experiment which are not virulent to humans. However, it wouldbe prudent to exercise care so that neither cell lines, laboratory, nor experimenters are accidentally contami-nated. The first cell line used for this fusion exercise is the same mouse myeloma used by Drs. Georges K5hlerand Cesar Milstein during their hybridoma experiments in Cambridge. England. Itis a non-secretorymyeloma. or primary tumor of mouse bone marrow. The other cell line also comes from a mouse. Itis a non-cancerous spontaneous tumor. called a r.euroblastoma. taken from a mouse brain. It secretesacetylcholinesterase. together with enzymes for the synthesis of the neurotransmitters, choline acetylase andtyrosine hydroxylase.In this laboratory you will fuse two morphologically distinct cell lines. brain and bone. You will study theparent cell lines. subculture them. fuse them. prepare slides of both pure and fused cultures for staining. andcytologically stain both parent and fused cell lines. You will then study the stained cells to see if fusion betweenthe brain and bone cell lines did indeed occur.Pre-labSupplies needed: inverted microscopemicroscopecentrifuge2 centrifuge tubes. slides2 1 sterile pipets10 sterile 10 ml. pipetsnon-sterile pipetstimer or watch3 sterile 25 ml. flasks6 sterile Leighton withMorton closures6 sterile Leighton large coverslips.24 x 50 mmcurved forcepsprobe2 pi-pumps. 1 for 1 & 2 ml. pipet sizeand 1 for 5 & 10 ml. pipet size.

Plan the laboratory well in advance, but, if possible, avoid contamination durirg handlingand subculturing by arranging to have cultures for each laboratory group delivered just two or three daysin advance of laboratory start. Each 25 ml. flask should contain 5 ml. of cell suspension. This deliveryschedule allows time for the cells to grow into confluency in the culture flasks (to cover surfaces of flaskunder liquid one cell layer deep). At the same time, not enough time has elapsed to require a mediachange. Upon arrival, immediately incubate culture flasks at 37\u00b0 C.If you do not wish to purchase individual flasks for each laboratory group, have the cell culturesdelivered one week in advance of laboratory start. When the cells have grown to confluence (two to threedays). subculture them, per the steps delineated in hour two, so that every laboratory group will have 5 ml.of cell suspension of each of the two parent cell lines in separate 25 ml. cell tissue culture flasks. Subculturingone flask provides cells for many groups.2) Prepare staining kits for each student group by preparing sets of labelled 30 ml. plastic vials containingthe following stains and reagents: 40% methanol. isopropyl alcohol. distilled water, freshly prepared Giemsastain, and xylene.To make Giemsa stain dissolve 0 5 gram Giemsa powder in 33 ml. glycerin (dissolution may requireone to two hours). Next, add 33 ml. acetone-free absolute methyl alcohol. This is a stock Giemsa stainsolution. To prepare for students, at the earliest 24 hours before use, dilute each ml. of stock by adding20 ml. distilled water.3) As to quantities. plan for each student group to use 20 ml. DMEM. 11 ml. SF DMEM. at least85 ml. PBS, and 1 ml. PEG. Provide 1 ml. of each color marker bead to each student group, if it is decidedto use them. The solutions are available from commercial suppliers. Universities also can be a source ofbiological materials.4) A 100 ml. bottle of permount is sufficient for several years of this exercise. It would be best for theinstructor to carefully dispense the permount on toothpicks as it is being used, because it hardens very quicklyupon exposure to air.5) To set up student equipment. have two or three student groups share one centrifuge. When the37\u00b0 C. water bath is required. prepare one for the entire class.b) Provide quantities of 70% alcohol for cleaning work surfaces, particularly during hours two and threeof this laboratory. Bccause alcohol can dry the skin, students appreciate having hand cream available. 27017 7) Pi-pumps and Pipet Aids are described in most biological supply catalogues. Both are excellentpipetting devices.8) Hand the students coverslips and Leighton tubes which have been sterilized as a unit.9) Use of marker beads isoptionalbecause of cost. Although students can identify the two cell typeswithout marker beads. they do dramatically highlight the separate lines and the fact of fusion. Beads espe-cially designed for this work are called dyed polystyrene microspheres with 2.5% solids-latex. If used, add1 ml. 0.2 p. m. beads to each of the two 25 ml. culture flasks. Use a separate color for each of the parentcell lines four to six hours before attempting the fusion step during hour three. The marker beads will beincorporated by the cells and provide an identifiable internal marker when viewed with a light microscope.Time RequiredThe creating a heterokaryon laboratory requires six classroom hours, in addition to preparations,discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students microscope.and confluent cultures of ME 115 mouse brain tumor cells and NS 1 mouse cancerous bone marrow cells.During this laboratory hour you will study the morphology of both parent cell lines. You also will practiceusing the inverted microscope and practice the art of pipetting with pi-pumps or other pipetting devices, aswell as review asceptic technique.StepsA. Review the following cell tissue culture asceptic techniques: 1)Prepare the work area by wiping it with 70% alcohol. Also rinse your hands with alcohol.2) Do not uncover any sterile glassware such as flasks. pipets. or petri dishes, until required. Neverleave them uncovered. Remember. sterile pipets do not have to be flamed. and hot pipets kill cells.3) Do not hold any opening straight up to the air. Microorganisms fall straight down. so hold openingsto the side. Flame the lips of such containers both before and after introducing a pipet and, orclosing it.4) Neverpipet by mouth. Use a pi-pump or similar device. Even though sterile pipets are plugged.mycoplasmas from the mouth can still creep through the cotton, and mycoplasma contaminationis a major source of tissue culture contamination.5) Use a sterile pipeteach timeyou draw from a bottle. Once the pipet has been exposed. the chancethat it has been contaminated is too great to risk reuse. This heavy use of pipets is essential tomaintaining pure cell lines.6) Pipetting and other techniques in this laboratory need to be performed as rapidly as possible tominimize opportunities for contamination.7) There should be no talking, singing. or whistling during the execution of sterile procedures.8) The success of this laboratory greatly depends on clean and precise execution.B. Practice pipetting exact volumes using non sterile pipets and plain water. Accustom yourself to pi-pumps.or similar pipetting devices. and how they operate. The more facile you become now with pipetting technique.the easier it will be to accomplish cell fusion successfully without contamination. and in the allotted laboratory hour. 271r,; C. Study the structure and function of an inverted microscope.D. Place the NIE 115 cell tissue culture flask on the stage of the inverted microscope and bring the cellsinto focus, first on low and then on high power.1.

Note differences in structure which should enable you totell these two cell cultures apart. F. Label the cell culture flasks you have observed and return them to the 37\" C. incubator.8. Why isit necessary for the incubator to be set at 3!\" C.? 273/ Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following supplies: the labelled NIE 115 and NS 1 cell culture flasks, 2 sterile 25 ml.cell culture flasks. 4 sterile Leighton tubes with flying coverslips and Morton closures. 2 sterile 10 ml. pipets.pi-pump or other pipetting device. and 10 ml. DMEM 10% FBS 1/2% PS (hereafter referred to as DMEM).In this laboratory hour you will study two established cell lines and then subculture them, using aseptictechnique.A. Observe again both the NIE 115 and NS 1 cultures under the inverted microscope, first under low andthen under high power. Verify that the morphology and cell structures are the same as those observed in hour one.9. Has the physical orientation of the NIE 115 cells changed since hour one? If it has changed, how has it changed? 10. Why would it (not) have changed) 11. Has the physical orientation of NS 1 cells changed since hour one? If it has changed. how has it changed? 12. Why would it (not) have changed? B. Using aseptic technique and a 10 ml. pipet with a pipetting device. withdraw 5 ml. fresh DMEM.C. Add the 5 ml. DMEM to the NIE 115 flask, washing the cells from the flask surface by titurating withthe pipet. (Note: titurating is a term used to describe the sucking in and out. or up and down motion of liquidgoing in and out of the pipet.) Titurate gently until you feel certain that the cells in the flask are in the DMEMsolution and not stuck to the sides of the culture flask.D. Draw the entire mixture into the pipet. Do not remove the pipet from the flask until you have collectedthe full volume of cell suspension mixture.E. Immediately place 5 ml. of the cell suspension into a new 25 ml. sterile flask. Then, without toughingthe pipet to anything. add 1.5 ml. to each of the 2 sterile Leighton tubes with flying coverslips and Mortonclosures. Dispose of the pipet and any remaining mixture. 274 F. Repeat the procedures of steps B through E with the NS 1 flask.G. Label the new cultures with the proper cell line indicator, passage number (since this will be the firsttime you have subcultured the cell lines, this passage number will be 41), date, and your initials I-IObserve the new cultures under the inverted microscope. Check to see that the morphology and cellstructures are the same as at the beginning of the hour, thereby confirming that you have not confused cell lines. I.Place the flasks and tubes in the 37\u00b0 C. incubator. Make sure that the caps on the Leighton tubes andflasks are tight.J. Incubate for 24 to 48 hours. Before proceeding with hoer three. determine with the inverted micro-scope that cells have again grown into confluency.Procedure: Hour 3Note: If marker beads are to be used, the instructor or students, four to six hours before the start of thislaboratory session. should add 1.0 ml. 0.2 \u00b5 m. colored latex beads to each 25 ml. flask containing parentalcell Jines (different colored beads for each cell line). The 37\u00b0 C. water bath, from which students will takewater to fill styrofoam cupS later in the hour. will need to be turned on in advance of hour start.Students need the following supplies: inverted microscope. confluent cell cultures from hour two, centri-fuge. 15 ml. sterile centrifuge tubes. 11 ml.

Observe the parent cell line flasks under an inverted microscope.13. Are the cells in each flask of the same type you started with during thE. first hour of this laboratory? If the answer to question thirteen is no. you must repeat hours one and two this laboratory before youcan continue. If tlie answer to question thirteen is yes. proceed with hour thre.e. as follows.B. Harvest the NIE 115 flask using a sterile 10 ml. pipet with pipetting dei.ice. Harvesting of cell linesis accnplished by employing the titurating technique described during hour tWo.C. Place the cell suspension in a 15 ml. sterile centrifuge tube. Centrifuge :for 3 minutes at 300 G's.D. Carefully pour off the fluid in the centrifuge tube, leaving the pellet formed from centrifuging in thebottom of the tube. This procedure is known as decanting (pouring off) the supelmatant (surface liquid).E. Pipet 10 ml. PBS with a sterile 10 ml. pipet and pipetting device. and add it to the pelletized cells inthe centrifuge tube. Gently agitate and titurate the tube to resuspend the pellet.F Again, centrifuge the tube for 3 minutes at 300 G's.G. Again, decant the supernatant. and resuspend the formed pellet in 1 mi. PBS using a sterile 1 ml.pipet and a pipetting device. This double centrifuging and suspending in PBS serves to wash the cells freeof DMEM. 2751'tiA. Li 4 H. Repeat steps B through G using the NS 1 cell line. 1.Transfer the NIE 115 cell suspension to the tube containing the NS 1 cell suspension using a sterile5 ml. pipet and a pipetting device.J. Centrifuge the mixed cell suspension 3 minutes at 300 G's.K. Carefully aspirate (suck up with a sterile 5 ml. pipet and pipetting device) as much of the supernatantas you can, leaving the pellet as dry as possible. L.This next step is critical. It is easier to accomplish if two students work together. Over a styrofoamcup filled with 37\u00b0 C. water. roll and agitate the centrifuge tube containing the cell pellet. While doing this,with a sterile 1 ml. pipet and a pipetting device, slowly add 1 ml. 50% PEG solution over a 1 minute timeperiod.Timing and coordination are very important, hence the suggestion for joint effort.M. Continue to incubate the tube for one minute over the 37\u00b0 C. styrofoam cup water bath. Slowlyremove the pipet and continue to roll the tube during incubation. Remember aseptic technique.N. Keep gently rolling the tube over the water bath for another minute, while at the same timeslowly adding 1 nil. SF DMEM with a sterile 1 ml. pipet and pipetting device.0. Over a further two to three minute period add 10 ml. additional SF DMEM with a sterile 10 ml pipetand a pipetting device. Continue to gently agitate and roll the cell suspension tube over the water bath. P.Pelletize this cell suspension by centrifuging for 3 minutes at 300 G's.Q. Decant the supernatant.R. Resuspend the pellet in 10 ml. DMEM using a 10 nil. pipet and a pipetting device. Titurate gently withthe pipet. Do not remove the pipet from the tube.S. Using the 10 ml. pipet left in the tube, inoculate 2 Leighton tubes with 1.5 ml. of cell suspension each.T. Place the remaining cell suspension in a 25 ml. sterile tissue culture flask.U. Label the new cultures with the proper cell line, passage number, date, and your initials. Make surethat the caps are tight on both flasks and Leighton tubes. Incubate them in a 37\u00b0 C. incubator for 48 to 72hours. Do not start hour four until incubation period has elapsed.Procedure: Hour 4Students need the following supplies: the incubated cultures in Leighton tubes. centrifuge, 6 each 15 ml.centrifuge tubes. approximately 60 ml. PBS at 37\u00b0 C., 3 each 5 ml. pipets, 1 each 10 ml. pipet, pipettingdevice, staining kit, extra 40% methanol, probe. forceps, and 6 microscope slides which have been refrigerated(810\u00b0 C.) in 40% methanol.Note to instructor:the incubated flask from conclusion of hour three should be held in reserve in theevent a student group needs to repeat staining procedures of hours four and five. Similarly, incubated flasksfrom conclusion of hour two also should be held in reserve. Keep flasks in incubator at 37\" C.. where they canremain viable without fresh media for approximately one week.Aseptic technique does not need to be strictly observed during this labora: )ry hour, and thus clean, butnot sterile, pipets may be used.Students will prepare cells for staining during this laboratory hour. 276Is4.00 StepsA. Gently decant the medium from each of the 6 Leighton tubes into separate 15 ml. centrifuge tubes(2 NIE 115 tubes, 2 NS 1 tubes, and 2 potential heterokaryon tubes). Set the centrifuge tubes aside.B. Gently rinse the Leighton tubes with 5 ml. 37\u00b0 C. PBS per tube. Use 5 ml. pipets with a pipettingdevice for this procedure. Care is required so as not to dislodge the cells which should be growing on the sidesand coverslip area inside the tubes. Discard the rinsing fluid.C. Gently remove the flying coverslips from the Leighton tubes using forceps and probe. Carefullyimmerse each coverslip in the methanol vial from the staining kit. Allow each coverslip to fix for 7 minutesin the methanol.D. Remove the coverslip and allow it to air dry for 24 hours, or overnight.When you removed each coverslip you may have seen an opaque area on the coverslip indicating cellgrowth. If this occurred, hour four procedure is now complete. But when in doubt, or if you suspect that manyof the cells did not stick to the coverslip (quite possible with NS 1 cells, and perhaps also the fusion cells),then proceed as follows:E. Put the appropriate centrifuge tubes prepared in step A into a centrifuge and spin the cells for 3 minutesat 300 G's.F. Decant the supernatant, and gently.titurate to resuspend the formed cell pellet in 10 ml. PBS usinga 10 ml. pipet.G. Centrifuge again for 3 minutes at 300 G's.H. Decant the supernatant, and resuspend by tituration the formed cell pellet in 5 ml. methanol for 7 minutes.Use a 5 ml. pipet for this procedure. I.Centrifuge again for 3 minutes at 300 Cs.J. Decant the supernatant, and resuspend by tituration the formed cell pellet in 1 ml.methanol. Use a1 ml. pipet for this procedure.K. Pipet the cells onto a microscope slide which is propped at a 45 degree angle and which has just beenremoved from a cold 40% methanol solution. Cover surface of the 'slide with the solution. Allow the slideto air dry for 24 hours, or overnight.Procedure: Hour 5Students need the following supplies: the air dried coverslips and/or microscope slides from hour four ofthis laboratory. staining kit with fresh Giemsa stain, extra staining (Giemsa stain, isopropyl alcohol,distilled water, and xylene), probe, forceps. 6 8 microscope slides. permount, toothpicks, and 1 - 3 petri dishes.During this hour you will cytologically stain and permanently mount both parent and fused cell lines.StepsA. Place the air dried coverslips into a Giemsa staining vial, and/or put the air dried microscope slidesinto petri dishes and cover with Giemsa stain. Allow the cells to fix for three to four minutes in the Giemsa stain.B. Removecoverslips/slides from Giemsa stain, and dip coverslips three times in the distilled water vial.and/or rinse microscope slides with distilled water. 2772 6 4 C. Dehydrate coverslips for 1 minute in the isopropyl alcohol vial, and/or rinse microscope slides withisopropyl alcohol.D. Allow the coverslips to clear for 1 minute in the xylene vial, and/or rinse microscope slides for 1 minutewith xylene.E. Mount specimens. For flying coverslips. place 3 drops of permount. using a toothpick, on a microscopeslide in area where coverslip is to be mounted. Slowly lower the coverslip, cell side down, onto the slide. Itis best to start at a 45 degree angle with the coverslip so as to trap a minimum number of air bubbles. Carefullypress the coverslip to remove bubbles and evenly disperse the permount. For slides, place 4 drops of permount,using toothpicks. over the area of greatest cell number. Lower a clean glass coverslip over the slide. Carefullypress to remove air bubbles and evenly disperse the permount.F. Carefully label the slides and allow them to air dry for 24 hours or overnight.Procedure: Hour 6Students need the following supplies: prepared slides and light microscopes.Students will observe stained cell populations and determine whether fusion between cell lines did indeedoccur.A. Study the pure parent NIE 115 and NS 1 cell slides under the microscope, first on low and then highpower.14. Draw three typical NIE 115 cells in the space provided below. Be very careful to determine the proportionof cytoplasm to nucleus, and note any irregularities in the cell membranes. Label all the cell structures youcan identify in your drawings. 15. Describe how the cells physically orient to each other 2782$5 16. Draw three typical NS 1 cells in the space provided below. Be very careful to determine the proportionof cytoplasm to nucleus. and note any irregularities in the cell membranes. Label all cell structures you can identify. 17. Describe how the cells physically orient to each other. 18. Are your answers to questions fourteen through seventeen similar to your answers to questions one throughseven in laboratory hour one? Why or why not? B. Study under a microscope the two prepared slides of the (hopefully) fused cells, first under low andthen under high power.19. Can you find any cells which have fused, or look as if they have two nuclei instead of one?20. What proportion of the cells on view in your slide have fused? Polyethylene glycol does not selectively permit only certain types of cells to fuse. Any cell might havefused with any other nearby cell. Two cells of the same type might have fused. Cells which were not in closeproximity with one another when the PEG was introduced would not have fused. You might have createdseveral different heterokaryons. 279 21. Of the fused cells on your prepared slides, how many of them appear to be fusions of the two parentcell lines?22. Draw as many fused heterokaryons as you can find in your slides in the space provided below. Be carefulto determine the proportion of cytoplasm to nucleus, and note any irregularities in the cell membranes. Labelall identified cell structures. Also label all those cells which you believe to be heterokaryons fused from bothNS 1 and NIE 115 cell lines. 23. One parent cell line is secretory. On many of the cells of this line you can observe small bubble-like struc-tures attached to the cell membrane. These are molecules the cell cytoplasm is secreting. These cells havea relatively large amount of cytoplasm in proportion to the nucleus. because the cytoplasm manufactures thecell secretions. Which parent cell line is this?24. One parent cell line is non-secretory. These cells have a relatively large nucleus in comparison to thecytoplasm. Which parent cell line is this?25. Do the heterokaryons which you believe are the product of the two different cell lines exhibit any of thetraits of the parent cell lines? What might these be? ResourcesAnderson, W.

LaboratoryChicken Embryology When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:a.Describe the changes that take place in a chicken eggduring development.2.List four stages of embryonic development.3.Diagram an embryo containing the three primary germlayers.4.Identify the body parts formed from each primaryembryonic germ layer.5.Identify typical- structures and embryonic stages during thedevelopment of a chicken egg. Chicken EmbryologyEmbryology is the study of young animals or plant sporophytes while still contained within, a protectivestructure such as an egg, uterus. or seed. It is one of the most important subjects in all of natural history.as was emphasized earlier in the nineteenth century by Charles Darwin and others. Embryological clues areused to link species and trace ancestries. Since all embryos go through sequenced stages of development.with later structures emerging from primary tissues, similarities during specific stages are used to relate formswhich may differ considerably during their adult phases.The common chicken. used throughout the world as a major protein source. is an easily obtained subjectfor embryological studies. From hen ovary to finished product, the chicken embr'yo goes through the typicalsequence of fertilization, tissue formation, differentiation, growth. and birth.In this laboratory. you will learn about the egg laying apparatus of a chicken. You will then take eggs.incubate them. open them at different stages. and study their phases of development. In laboratory twentysix, after some of the eggs have been allowed to hatch, you will study chicken behavior.Egg LayingBirds differ from mammals in having only one ovary and oviduct. The ovary of a laying hen containsfive to six yellow follicles, which are developing egg yolks with accompanying ova (eggs), and many undeve-loped follicles. As a young hen matures, FSH (follicle from the pituitary stimulates the ovary and its follicles. When the ovary becomes mature enough it secretes estrogen-, whichcauses the development of the oviduct and an increase in blood calcium, fats, and vitamins. all needed foregg forMation. Estrogen also causes the pubic bones to spread and the vent (where eggs and feces exit) toenlarge. Progesterone is then secreted by the ovary. and it stimulates the release of LH (leutinizing hormone)from the pituitary, which in turn causes the release of a mature ovum and egg yolk from the ovary into theoviduct. The released yolk-is covered by a thin membrane called a vitelline membrane. with the ovum attachedto the outside. 285291 The oviduct is also known as the egg canal of a bird, and it has several distinct sections. The first, closestto the ovary, is a funnel-shaped structure called the infundibulum which catches released egg yolks and wherefertilization occurs. The egg making process continues whether or not the ovum has been fertilized. Next isthe magnum where egg white is deposited around the yolk. The egg's shell membranes are produced in theisthmus. The shell itself is laid around the membranes and their contents in the hen's uterus. The fully formedegg is then laid through the vent. The entire process of forming and laying an egg takes about twenty-sevenhours. with the egg remaining longest in the uterus. The YolkThe yolk provides necessary nutrients for the developing embryo. Ninety percent fertility is considered goodfertility in chicken eggs. Look for a small bullseye dot of yolk-free cytoplasm attached to the egg yolk membrane.That is the egg (ovum) itelf. Chicken sperm can survive in an lgg canal for one month. Therefore, one matingwill provide a hen with sufficient sperm for up to one month of fertile egg laying. If it has been fertilized, thebullseye will have a tiny lump in its center called a blastodisc. Cleavage and development occur only withinthis germinal disc- shaped area.Chicken embryos develop as the egg travels down the egg canal. When a fertilized egg is laid, the blastodiscwill be multicellular. Development stops when the egg is laid, and it does not start again until the temperatureis brought back up to a chicken's body temperature of 38\u00b0C. The most critical days in terms of survival fora chicken embryo are on the third day of incubation and just before hatching.One way to determine the age of a chicken egg is to crack it into a small bowl and observe the roundnessof the egg yolk. If the yolk stands well above the egg white in a semi-round shape. the egg is fresh. The flatterthe yolk. the older the egg.Sometimes an ovum and yolk produced by the ovary misses the infundibulum and gets lost in the abdominalcavity. If this happens to a hen, she will appear to be in a laying condition but does not lay a usable egg. Chickenfarmers call such hens internal layers.The Egg WhiteOnce the yolk has been caught by the infundibulum, it passes to the magnum of the oviduct, where thealbumen, or egg white, is deposited around the yolk. The egg white, like the yolk. is a complex protein. Albumenserves as a physical protection, or shock absorber, for the developing embryo. Albumen contains antimicrobialsubstances which protect the embryo from bacterial infection. Albumen also provides the chick with a ware-house of amino acids to draw on for protein synthesis, and the liquid is the chick's only source of water.As the egg travels down the egg canal, it twists like a corkscrew. This mechanically is the easiest methodfor squeezing through tight spaces. Often the albumen becomes tangled at the front and rear ends of an eggthrough this twisting motion. This tangled albumen is calledchalaza: you can see these whitened rope-likestructures in most bird eggs. Chalza has no function in an egg. (Flood spots also have no function, exceptfor demonstrating that chickens too can suffer from hemorrhoids).MembranesTwo shell membranes are added to the egg in the isthmus section of the oviduct. The thick outer membraneand the thin inner one stick together, except at the large end of the egg. where they separate to form a deadair space. This air space is very small when an egg is first laid, but as an egg cools the space expands. Oneway to tell if an egg is old is by the size of its air spaces (the larger, the older). This air space is very importantto the developing chick. One to three days before hatching the chick becomes an air breather when it puncturesthe inner membrane and sticks its head into the air space. When this happens you an hear the chick cheepinginside the egg. It must hatch before the air in the air space is expended. 286292 The Shell In the uterus the eggshell, formed almost completely of calcium carbonate, 's deposited. The shell attachesto the outer shell membrane. The hard shell protects the embryo and its food supply. but it is sufficiently porousto allow gas exchange with the environment. Eggshell colo is determined by the deposition of pigments inthe calcium carbonate as the shell is being deposited. Pigmentation is genetically determined by chicken variety.White eggs simply have no pigmentation. Some chickens called Araucanas lay Easter eggs, or eggs whoseshells are pigmented in different pastel colors. Laying hens require large amounts of calcium in their d'e.t. If they do not obtain enough calcium. problemsmay develop in the hen house. Eggs will have thin shells. Thin shdls lead to broken eggs. Once one chickenin a flock discovers that eggs are good to eat, they all can learn to crack and eat eggs. whether or not theyare thin shelled. The only way to stop such cannibalism is to kill all members of the flock.Light and Egg Production Light is extremely important to egg production, even though a rooster is not. When young hens reacha certain stage of sexual maturity. light stimulates the egg laying process. This process continues whether ornot the hen has been fertilized. The approach of winter with its shortening days reduces egg laying. This iswhy many chicken farmers provide artificial light in their hen houses during the short day months. Young henswill continue laying as long as a fourteen to sixteen hour day is maintained. Also, if laying begins at too earlyan age. the eggs will be small. If laying is delayed, by keeping the hens in an artificially shortened-day environment.eggs will be larger when production is stimulated. Optional Activity Although not detailed in the follov,..ng procedures, some classes may want to obtain a freshly killed layinghen for dissection. The instructor and/or students may then demonstrate the egg forming processes withinthe hen. Several eggs in different stages of development should be seen within the dissected oviduct. . Pre-lab Supplies neeed:Equipmentmicroscope 1)Stabilize the incubator's temperature at 38\u00b0C.. and maintain that temperature constant for at least twentyfour hours before placing eggs in the chamber. Make sure the incubator maintains the high humidity eggs needfor proper development.2) You can simultaneously hatch birds which incubate at the same temperature as ch. .kens. For example,pheasant and quail eggs hatch in 23 days, duck eggs hatch in 28-33 days (depending on species), guineaand turkey hatch in 27 days, and geese hatch in 28-33 days.3) The 0.9% saline solution is to be heated and used at 38\u00b0C. The instructor may prepare and heat theapproximately two liters required for an entire class. Alternatively, each student group may prey re the heatedsaline solution which will be used to lessen the shock of embryonic transplant from the egg. Using warmedsaline solution increases the time students may observe a living embryo.4) The unfertilized eggs specified for hour one may be purchased from any grocery store more cheaplythan fertilized eggs. Mass egg production techniques are such that commercial eggs usually are unfertilized.Of course there are exceptions, and lab participants may wish to verify infertility as they proceed with hourone. Hour one procedures may continue with a fertilized egg.5) This laboratory, with proper planning. provides the chicks to be imprinted during laboratory twenty-six.By obtaining and continuing to incubate more fertile eggs than are needed for this experiment, students willbe able to duplicate Lorenz' classic experiment on fowl imprinting. When calculating the number of fertile eggsto be incubated. the instructor should allow for approximately twenty percent sterility and death, in additionto the fertile eggs or chicks required for each ,:oup during laboratories twenty-four and twenty-six. Time RequiredThis chicken embryology laboratory requires four classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion,and review. Procedure: Hour 1Students need the following 1015 ml. 0.9% NaCI solution, dissecting scope.finger bowl, teasing needle. probe, watch glass. egg waste container, dissecting scissors, filter paper, andplastic spoon.You will study the structure of an unfertilized egg during this laboratory hour. Steps A. Carefully carry an egg. same side up as it is found, from the egg carton to your work area. While holdingthe egg same side up, place a small crack in the top of the shell with the blunt end of the probe or dissectingscissors. Try not to puncture or damage the shell membrane. The shell membrane toughens as an embryodevelops, and leaving it intact will be easier with fertilized eggs. Keeping the egg as steady as possible, carefullychip away the top third of the shell. leaving an opening through which the entire top of the egg yolk can beseen. Study the egg's structure. 288294 1Identify and label the parts of a chicken egg indicated by the lines in figure one below, writing on or nextto the lines. Figure 1B. The bullseye. or germinal disc, should be floating on the upper side of the yolk, depending on the endupon which the egg has been resting. Therefore, you should see the germinal disc on the upper surface ofthe yolk. Rest the egg in the finger bowl while studying the aerminal disc with the aid of a dissecting scope.If the germinal disc is not on the upper side of the yolk, carefully pour out the contents of the egg, withoutbreaking the vitelline membrane, into the finger bowl. Search for the germinal disc. When found, turn the yolkso that the disc is on its upper surface.C. Cut out a paper wand from filter paper using dissecting scissors. The wand itself should have a largeenough hole so that the germinal disc of the egg can fit inside. It should look something like figure two whencompleted (imagine a soap bubble blowing device with handle and loop). Figure 2D. Add a little saline solution to a watch glass (if you were dissecting a living embryo, and not an infertileegg. the saline solution would need to be 38\u00b0C.). Lay the circle of the filter paper wand on the yolk so thatthe germinal disc shows through the hole. Press he filter paper gently so that it becomes wet all over andsticks to the vitelline membrane.E. Carefully cut with dissecting scissors the vitelline membrane in a circle around the outside of the wand,to frc e the germinal disc from the yolk. F.Lift the wand slowly so that the embryo lifts from the surface of the yolk. Lay the disc in the salinesolution in the watch glass, and study it through the dissecting scope. 289295 'Nz 2. Draw the structure of the germinal disc in the space provided below, noting if you have opened a fertilizedor unfertilized egg. Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following supplies: fertile egg incubated for two days, microscope, dissecting scope,finger bowl, egg waste container, teasing needle, probe, watch glass, dissecting scissors, 0.9% saline solution,heat source, and beaker.During this laboratory hour you will dissect a fertile chicken egg incubated for two days.Early EmL. yological DevelopmentThe first cell of a new organism is the zygote, made from the fusion of sperm and egg. The zygote mitoticallydivides, and divides again, and these divisions in multicellular animals stick together to form a many celledblastula, or hollow ball of cells. The cavity of the blastula is called a blastocoel, and when the ball's surfaceno longer supports the dividing cells, it suddenly caves in to form the gastrula, which looks like a deflatedbasketball. This collapsing process is termed gastrulation, and the new cavity caused by gastrulation forms theprimitive gut, called the archenteron, of the embryo. The blastopore is the lip of the collapsed blastula. Be-cause of gastrulation, there are now two primary germ layers in the embryo, an inner one and an outer one.These are called endoderm and ectoderm, respectively. Primitive organisms with only two cell layers stop de-velopment at this early stage; most animals continue to form a third cell layer called the mesoderm.The three early embryological states zygote, blastula, and gastrula may summarized as shownin figure three. Zygote BlastulaFigure 3 290L..29tGastrula Initially the embryo does not become larger, but instead becomes denser and more complicated. Whensufficient cellular division has occurred, cells begin migrating from the blastopore into the space between theendoderm and the ectoderm. eventually forming the third layer. the mesoderm. This signals the start of thetriploblastic embryo stage. During the triploblastic embryo stage organ formation begins. This is known asorganogenesis.In general terms, the skin, nervous system, sensory organs, and the lining of the mouth and anus formfrom the ectoderm. The endoderm gives rise to the inner lining of the digestive tract and the formation oforo-ns related to it. The endoderm and the ectoderm jointly (in the area of the primitive blastopore) give risetoto mouth and anus. The mesoderm gives rise to all other tissues, organs, and systems.Organogenesis is accomplished by several cellular growth activities, such as invaginations (inpocketings),evaginations (outpocketings), cell thickenings. and epiboly (covering one cell layer with another).Embryonic InductionIt was long theorized that there must be something which controls and induces tissue differentiation andmorphogenesis. The German graduate student Hilde Mangold demonstrated in 1924 that the lip of the blastoporeacts as an organizer. She cut the dorsal lip from the embryo of one salamander and grafted it into the bellyregion of another embryo. When the embryo that had received the graft developed, it was found that a secondembryo had formed within its tissues. a sort of Siamese twin to the first. Because the two salamanders differedin color, it was possible to distinguish the tissues of the host embryo from those of the transplant. The graftedlip developed into a notochord. just as it would have done in its original embryo. but most of the second embryowas composed of tissues of the host, as could be seen from color differences. This experiment has been repeatedmany times, always with the same result. The dorsal lip of the blastopore consistently demonstrates an abilityto organize tissues.The process of organizing other cells into differentiated tissues is known as embryonic induction, It is nowknown that there are many tissue-forming inducers which act during the development of an organism. Induc-tion occurs if there are certain chemical exchanges between cells. Induction and differentiation do not occurif these chemical exchanges are blocked. Studies aimed at isolating all the chemicals and explaining the triggeringprocesses are now an active area of embryological research.The chemical exchanges can be of a very general nature, in that the capacity of the organizer to inducedifferentiation is not necessarily species-specific. For example, secondary neural plate formation can be inducedin a chicken embryo by grafting tissue from a rabbit embryo.The French Flag TheoryResearchers have theorized that inducers might operate on a cell per its position within a group. This \"Frenchflag\" theory states that if there is a group of undifferentiated cells, a chemical gradient is established throughdiffusion and that organonesis is determined by differing concentrations of the chemical within the groupof cells. While the cells are still undifferentiated. one cell can be removed, and the cells will adjust their rolesautomatically. If two cells simultaneously assume the lead position. development will include a degree of Siamesetwinning, in that there will be double cellular differentiation of the cells positioned immediately behind this doublet. Yolk Types in Embryonic DevelopmentA chicken egg represents only one of four basic types of egg development. The way an egg divides, orundergoes cleavage, is an important aspect of its growth. A chicken egg represents discoidal cleavage, in thatthe yolk is so massive that it changes the shape of the embryo to that of a flattened disc. Discoidal cleavageis typical of bony fishes, reptiles. birds. and monotremes. Because of the way the blastula is flattened. the blastulasof these egg !aying animals are called blastodiscs. The difference between a sea urchin blastula and a chickenblastula is illustrated in figure four on the following page. 291297 Sea Urchint.0,444010).117:i4 .414Air.45 Blastocoel Figure 4Chicken Another type of egg is one in which the yolk is scattered uniformly in the cytoplasm of the embryo andboth yolk and cytoplasm develop equally. This type undergoes equal cleavage of cells. Placental mammalsand echinoderms both undergo this type of embryological development.There is a third type of cell which demonstrates unequal cleavage. This type of egg has a vegetal pole(yolk), which' divides slowly, and an animal (embryo) pole, which divides much faster.The fourth type, superficial cleavage, is typical of arthropods. The yolk forms around a nuclear zygote.When division of the nucleus occurs, the divided cells migrate through the yolk to the outer periphery of theegg. The embryo then develops on the outer periphery. Changing egg orientation, and thus changing gravityduring development, can kill insect embryos.The BlastodiscWhen a fertile chicken egg is laid, the blastodisc a!rzady will have become a white mass about two millimetersin diameter attached to the yolk. The cells will number approximately 100.000 and group in two layers; thetop layer will give rise to the ectoderm and the lower layer to the endoderm. If incubation is begun, a lineknown as the primitive streak (technically the blastopore) will appear shortly. Cells migrating through the primitivestreak form the mesoderm and part of the endoderm. When gastrulation is complete, mesodermal tissue nearthe center of the embryo pinches off to form the notochord and the pairs of somites, or prirniiive segments,which lie in rows along the notochord. The notochord induces the ectoderm above it to form the neural plate,and subsequently the neural plate folds tq form the neural tube. The neural tube differentiates into the brainand spinal cord.Extraembryonic MembranesExtraembryonic membranes connect the developing embryo to its food supply, the yolk. During embryologicaldevelopment the extraembryonic membranes are more obvious than the embryo itself. Extraembryonicmembranes form as extensions of the blastodisc. Each membrane is formed from a combination of two of thethree basic tissue types, endoderm, mesoderm. or ectoderm.The yolk gradually is enveloped by the yolk sac membrane. Blood vessels in the yolk sac membrane carryfood from the yolk to the embryo. An amniotic sac encloses the embryo; it is filled with amniotic fluid whichprotects and cushions the embryo. The amniotic sac is composed of two membranes, an inner amnion and 292298 an outer chorion. The allantois, a pouch attached to the embryo inside the amniotic sac during early stagesof development, functions as a garbage can for embryonic wastes. This membrane can be found stuck to theshell after the chick hatches. The allantois, in the later stages of embryonic development, becomes the chori-oallantoic membrane, formed by the fusion of the allantoic wall with the chorion. It acts as a respiratory membranefor the embryo.and is plentifully supplied with blood vessels.During this laboratory hour you will study a two day old chick embryo. A two day old chick embryo mountedon a slide should appear similar to the drawing in figure five below. If conditions for incubation have beenless than ideal, the embryo might still be living but not be as advanced in appearance as the drawing suggests. Cerebellum Otocyst.1,.:Mesencephalon Diencelphalon Lens of Eye HourChicken Embryo StepsA. Use instructions followed during hour one of this laboratory to open and study a two day incubatedchicken egg. Note the exact time you expose the embryo from the surrounding albumen. Use the dissectingscope to clarify embryonic structures.Note that a two day old chick embryo has started to twist to the right so that the head region is now lyingon the chick's left side. This is the process of torsion, which will continue until the whole embryo is lying onits left side. At the same time, the embryo curls up so that the neural tube takes the shape of an upside downbackwards question mark, with a bend in the area of the hindbrain.B.

Using a filter paper wand and 0.9% warmed saline solution in the bottom of a watch glass, carefullytransfer the embryo to the saline solution. (This technique was outlined during hour one of this laboratory).10. Locate the parts of the brain. The optic cup has induced formation of the lens of the eye by the ectoderm.and the neural tube has induced formation of the primitive ear. Diagram parts of the brain and sensory organsin the space provided below. Procedure: Hour 3Students need the following materials and supplies: fertile egg incubated four days. microscope.dissecting scope, finger bowl, egg waste container, teasing needle, probe, watch glass. dissecting scissors. 0.9%saline solution, heat source. and beaker.During this laboratory hour you will study a four day old chicken embryo.

Describe any differences: Your embryo should have developed about forty-one somites, and the yolk should be partially coveredwith prominent blood vessels. The brain should be divided into three distinct regions, with the eye easier tosee because tissues have beome thicker in that area.C. Remove the membranes surrounding the embryo so that you can see the heart and limb buds.Note: If the embryo is dead. obtain another egg from the instructor and repeat steps A-C above.12. Record heart beats per minute:13. Note how long the heart continues to beat in your embryo once it is exposed') 14. Describe how blood is circulating in the extraembryonic membranes of your specimen? D. Use a probe or teasing needle to straighten out the embryo so that the pharyngeal clefts and pouchesare visible. (These structures appear at some stage in all vertebrate embryos).15. What membrane completely encloses the embryo? The fluid-filled sac at the posterior end of the embryo is the allantois. It will expand and eventually fusewith the chorion and become highly vascularized.16. What are the two functions of the allantois? E. Using a filter-paper wand and 0.9% warmed saline solution in the bottom of a watch glass, carefullytransfer the embryo to the saline solution. 296302 17.

Procedure: Hour 4Students need the following materials and supplies: fertilized egg incubated ten to twelve days, dissectingscope, finger bowl, teasing needle, probe, watch glass, egg waste container, and dissecting scissors.During this laboratory hour you will study a ten to twelve day old chicken embryo. This will be the lastview of a chicken embryo before hatching. All major developmental processes occur during the first six daysof development. The embryo then grows larger and matures during the rest of the incubation period. untilit hatches at twenty-one days.

Compare your embryo with figure seven on the previous page. Describe any differences: The embryo should have developed large, prominent, pigmented eyes by day eight of incubation. Theiris of the eye should be clearly visible, with eyelids developing to cover the eyes. The small opening behindthe eye is the ear. At eleven days the limbs are developing, and toes should be very distinct, with claws onthe ends of the toes. There should be wing \"fingers\" on the wing bud, even though the chicken does not havefingers in later life. The chicken's beak should be well developed. The brain is visible through the transparentskull, and the skin should be covered by prominent feather buds. Note how large the head is in relation to the trunk.19.

LaboratoryCat Dissection When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Locate and descrthe action of at least twenty catmuscles.2.Trace the digestive path of a cat from mouth to anus.3.Trace the circulatory and respiratory systems of a cat.4.Identify the excretory and reproductive structures of a cat.5.Identify the basic structures of a cat's nervous system.6.Identify as to type and function at least fifteen bones andthree joints in a cat. IntroductionThe cat is popular for mammalian anatomy studies. Its size is convenient for laboratory dissection, andit represents basic anatomical features of the class Marnmalia. Students who continue on to a medical careerwill dissect and study human cadavers in great detail. This laboratory introduces requisite anatomical knowl-edge and dissection skills.Pre-labSupplies needed:Equipmentdissecting pan razor forcepslarge plastic bag with tie colored pencils slidesbone scissors coverslipsmicroscope probe ruler Preparations1) Purchase double latex injected cats: such specimens are preferable for study of the circulatory system. 2)If students are squee.,nish, the instructor may provide disposable latex surgical gloves, which are avail-able in boxes of one hundred. However, students will gain more from the dissection if bare hands are used.3) Standard dissecting pans are too short for cat dissections. Earth science stream tables, used in the studyof soil erosion. are a good size for cat dissections. 303309 Time RequiredThis cat dissection laboratory requires eight classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion,and review.Procedure:Hour 1Students need the following supplies: cat, dissecting pan, probe, forceps, dissecting scissors, coloredpencils, and large plastic bag and tie. You will study the external structure of a cat during this laboratory hour and begin skinning the specimen.StepsA. Study the external structures of the cat. Locate the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the specimen. Thecat's trunk is divided into the chest, or thorax. and a belly, or abdomen. Note the two external characteristicsunique to all mammals: hair and mammary glands. 1. Describe your particular cat so that it can be distinguished from other specimens (fur color. etc.). 2. How many nipples, or teats. does your cat have? Most mammals have separate urogenital and anal openings. The anal opening of a cat is located at thebase of the tail. dorsal to the urogenital opening. In males, the urogenital structures consist of a penis andthe testes. contained in a sac called the scrotum. 3.Is your cat male or female2 Study the cat's feet. In a cat the claws are retractable, and the epidermis on the bottom of the cat's feetis thickened into pads. 4.How many pads are on each foot? 5. Do cats walk on the entire soles of their feet, on their toes. or only on their claws? 6. How can you tel! from observing a dead cat how it walked? Study the cat's head. Locate the face. The lips around the mouth are well developed, and the upper lipis cleft in the center by a groove called the philtrum. The nares are on a naked nose. The eyes have upperand lower lids as well as a small nictitating membrane. 304310 7. In the space provided below draw a cat's eye, with its surrounding structures. Label the lids andmembranes. 8. Notice that the ears possess a long flexible external fold. This fold is called the pinna, and it directs soundwaves into the external auditory meatus of the ear. In the space provided below, draw a cat's ear, and labelthe external structures. B. Open the cat's mouth. Note the placement of the tongue. Study the placement of both upper and lowerteeth. In the front of the mouth, there are six similar-appearing teeth on both the upper and lower jaws. Theseare incisors. On each side of the incisors there is a car.ine tooth, for a total of four canine teeth. Canine teethare long and pointed. After each canine tooth there are two premolars, for-a total of eight premolars. An adultcat will have a molar tooth after the premolars on each side of the jaws. for an additional four teeth. Juvenilecats will not have molar teeth. 305311 9. In the space provided below, diagram your cat's upper and lower jaws. In the diagram place the cat's teethas you observe them. Label the teeth as to type. 10.Is your cat specimen an adult or a juvenile? How can you determine this? C You will now skin your specimen. Use dissecting scissors, preferably those with one blunt tip. Insertthe tip between the skin and muscles of the cat in the neck opening made during embalming of your speci-men. Do not cut into the musculature of the animal. Continue the cut to the front of the neck. then up tothe chin and down the boc.ls. as illustrated in figure one.If your specimen is a female. cut around each mammary gland. and leave as much teat as possible withthe gland.Cut around the mouth. ears, eyes. wrists and ankles, leaving the fur on the feet, chin, ears. and eye areas.and carefully separate the skin from underlying tissues with the blunt end of your scissors or probe.Note: Students will begin the skinning process during the first laboratory hour, but they will need tocomplete it during the second laboratory hour. When class time has expired. store the cat in a large plasticbag on the dissecting tray. along with the dissecting utensils. Students should label their specimens. 306312 Figure 1 307313 Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following supplies: cat, dissecting pan, probe, forceps, dissecting scissors, and largeplastic bag and tie. During this laboratory how you will complete the skinning process and then study the musculatureof a cat. StepsA. Complete the skinning process begun in hour one of this laboratory. B. Study the muscles exposed by the skinning process. All striated muscles are covered with a tough con-nective tissue known as fascia. Fascia near the skin is spongy and is known as superficial fascia. This is whatyou separated when skinning the cat. A second inner layer. deep fascia. is rather thin and somewhat iridescentin appearance. Observe the calf of a hind leg with its musculature. The leg calf is the gastrocnemius muscle. Themuscle has two ends, known as heads. Skeletal muscles are connected by tissue bands to the bone thatthey move. The point where a muscle connects to a bone that it moves is known as the insertion ofthe muscle. The proximal attachment of the muscle (at the other end) is known as the origin. The originattachment usually is to another bone, but one which that particular muscle does not move. The functionof the muscle is to move the animal's bone in a specific way. This is known as the muscle's action. Look for individually covered bundles of muscle fibers within the muscle. The thick part of a muscle isknown as the belly. and the cords of connective tissue at the ends of the muscle are called tendons. If thecords were flat. as they are on the animal's trunk, they would be called aponeuroses. Aponeuroses attach skin rnuscles which lack skeletal attachments. Observe the side of the cat's body. Youshould see a large sheet of skin muscle called the cutaneous maximus. The cutaneous maximus originateson each side of the latissimus dorsi and of the ventral pectoral muscles. See figure two to locatethese structures. Study figure two, on the following page. which diagrams a lateral view of superficial trunk and limb mus-culature. Find on your specimen the muscles labeled in the diagram. Study figure three. on page 310. which diagrams a lateral view of deep trunk and limb musculature. Findon your specimen the muscles labeled in the diagram. Study figure four, on page 311. which diagrams a ventral view of superficial and deep trunk and limb mus-culature. Find on your specimen the muscles labeled in the diagram. 11. Determine the location and describe the action of the muscles listed in figure five on page 312. 308314 Figure 21. 312320 12. In the chart provided below. figure six. identify other muscles you have found in your specimen. Name Location Action Figure 6Procedure:Hour 3Students need the following supplies: cat, dissecting pan. probe. forceps, dissecting scissors, bone-cuttingscissors. colored pencils. and plastic bFig and tie.You will expose and study the abdominal and thoracic cavities and viscera during this laboratory hour.and identify the major visceral membranes and organs of your specimen.StepsA. Open the abdominal and thoracic cavities with scissors. Cut through the cat's body wall just to the rightof the midventral line from the clavicle to the anus. To do this in the thoracic region, you will have to cut throughthe cartilagenous ribs on the cat's right side. Do not attempt to split the sternum. As you cut through the ribs,make lateral cuts as neede3 in order to lift the ribs up and out to expose the thoracic cavity. As you lift theribs up and out, each rib should crack near the vertebral column. If they do not crack, cut them.The two coelomic cavities. both abdominal and thoracic. lie inside a balloon-like membrane which extendsthe length of the trunk. This serous membrane derives from a pair of membranes which enclosed organs andtissues in opposite sides of the body, many of which still appear in pairs. However. mammals have evolvedso that some organs, such as the stomach and intestines, extend into both sides of the body. The coelomicmembranes grew together and became ciouble-walled in places. particularly along the midline of the body.These double-walled sections are called rnesentv. and they support and protect organs within the coelom cavity-you should see a double-walled structure surrounding the heart. This double-walled mesentery is called the pericardium. The membranes at the caudel, or lower end of the pericardial sacare thickened with connective tissue which attaches to the diaphragm. The diaphragm effectively divides thecoelomic cavities into abdominal and thoracic regions, or, as they are also known, respectively, the peritonealsac and the pleural and pericardial sacs. Various ligaments attach organs such as the liver, stomach, and reproduc-tive organs to the mesentery in the peritoneal, or abdominal sac. B. Locate the above mentioned membranes, sacs, and ligaments in your specimen. Figure seven shouldhelp you with the identification process. C. Locate the following thoracic structures in your specimen. 1). The lungs and heart. These organs nearly fill the entire thoracic cavity.13. Draw the lungs in the space provided below. Include all lobes in your sketch, and label structures to whichthe lungs are attached. 2). Thymus gland. Locate the thymus between the lungs and above, or cranial to the heart. Thethymus covers large blood vessels and the bifurcation of the trachea from the lungs into primarybronchi. The younger the specimen the larger the thyr: will be. It may be so large that thebronchi will not be visible until it is removed. The thymus is part of the lymphatic, or immunesystem, as noted in discussion twenty-two. 315323 14. Draw the thymus in the space provided below. Label the structures to which the ,,iymus gland is attached. D. Locate the following abdominal structures.1). Esophagus. From the pharynx the esophagus passes on the side of a cat's neck, throughthe thoracic cavity dorsal to the trachea. to join the stomach at the cranial end of the abdomen.2). Liver. The liver is the very large, dark-brown organ pushed against the diaphragm. It is the largestorgan in the cat. It is divided into right and left halves. The left liver consists of two lobes and theright liver consists of three. Bile is drained from liver cells by very small canals which run betweenthe individual liver cells. These little canals collect into bile ducts which in turn drain into the gallbladder.In addition to bile production the liver is responsible for chemical conversions of sugar. amino acids,and fats absorbed from the intestines.3). Gall bladder. The gall bladder is a dark-green organ stuck in the right lobe of the liver. It is a collect-ing point for bile. The gall bladder eventually empties its bile collection into the duodenum as itis needed for digestion, primarily of fats.15. Draw the liver and gall bladder in the space provided below. Include all the lobes. and label the structuresto which the liver and gall bladder are attached. 3163 2 4 4). Stomach. The stomach is a fat J-- haped structure just below the liver in your specimen. It shouldbe greyish-white in color, and it is divisible into three regions. The first region, called the cardiacregion, is where the stomach is hooked in to the esophagus. The large, bulging portion in themiddle of the stomach is called the fundic, and the narrow region which joins the small intestineis called the pyloric region. 5)Spleen. The spleen is a long, flat, red or dark-brown organ lying to the left of the stomach. Thespleen is part of the lymphatic system, along with the thymus, lymph nodes, and follicles. (See'figure fifteen in how five of this laboratory for a diagram of lymph node locations). In addition tothe spleen's role as a lymphatic organ, it removes old red blood cells from circulation, anddissociates their hemoglobin into bilirubin (bile pigment) and iron which are restructured intohemoglobin within new red blood cells. 16. Draw the spleen in the space provided below. Label the structures to which the spleen is attached. 6). Small intestines. These intestines hook onto the stomach. They are attached to each other andthe dorsal body wall by mesentery containing blood vessels and nerves. The small intestinesare divisible into three sections. Where the intestine hooks onto the stomach is known as theduodenum. The middle p ..tion of the small intestine is called the jejunum, and the last sectionis called the ileum.7). Pancreas. The pancreas is a two-lobed gland the mesentery between the stomach and the loopof the duodenum. The pancreas is usually drained by two ducts. One duct joins the bile duct fromthe gall bladder and empties into the duodenum. Often there is an additional duct which entersthe duodenum near the jejunum.The pancreas produces seven or eight different digestive enzymes in the cat. Additionally, areasof the pancreas called Isles of Langerhans produce the hormones insulin and glucagon. 317325 17. Draw the pancreas of your specimen in the space provided below. Label the structures to which the pan-creas is attached. 8). Cecurn. The cecum is a blind pouch where the small and large intestines neet.9). Large intestine. The large intestine, or colon, like the stomach and small intestines, is d;vided intothree main segments. The first section is on the right side of your specimen and is known as theascending colon. The middle portion of the large intestine is on the left side of your specimen andis called the descending colon. The intestinal tract which connects the ascending and descendingcolons is called the transverse colon. In a cat the transverse colon is poorly defined. The last sectionof the large intestine is a straight tube connected with the anus known as the rectum.10). Anal glands. The anal glands are paired scent glands opening to the rectum very close Lo the anus.18. Draw the anal glands of your specimen in the space provided below. Label the structures to which theyare attached. 318326 11). Kidneys. The kidneys are dark red-brown structures the size of walnuts which are located on thedorsal abdominal wall. Unlike the other organs observed so far, the kidneys are not suspended inthe abdomen but are attached on either side of the backbone. They are covered by the peritoneum,and the right kidney should b touching the liver.12). Adrenal glands. The adrenals are located on the cranial side of each kidney, like a cap on top ofeach organ.19. Draw the kidneys and adrenal glands in the space provided below. Label the structures to which they areattached in the body of your specimen. 319327 Procedure: Hour 4Students need all listed supplies except the straw.During this laboratory hour you will trace the digestive and respiratory systems of your specimen.StepsA. Locate and study the salivary glands. There are five pairs of salivary glands, three pairs of which areeasy to see and should have been exposed when you removed the skin of the head and neck to examinethe cat's musculature. The major function of salivary glands is to provide lubrication for food. Secondarily theysecrete the enzyme amylase which converts starch to dextrose.The first pair to be studied, the parotid glands, lie just beneath the skin and below the ear. The parotidducts connecting them to the mouth open just inside the cheek opposite the last premolar tooth. The parotidsare composed of predominantly enzyme-producing cells which secrete amylase.The submaxillary glands are below the parotids at the angle of the jaw. The submaxillary ducts connectingthe glands to the mouth's interior open to the mouth through a small papilla at the base of the cat's tongue.The submaxillary glands are composed equally of enzyme producing cells and mucus producing cells. Thesublingual glands are attached to the submaxillary glands and are about two centimeters long. They are com-posed almost exclusively of mucus producing cells.20. Diagram in the space provided below the location. position, and over-all shape of the parotid. submaxil-lary, and sublingual salivary glands in the cat's head. B. Cut through the muscles and skin at the corners of your specimen's mouth. Press down on the lowerjaws with your fingers, being careful not to impale yourself on cat teeth. Cut the angle of the jaw with bonecutting scissors. Locate and identify the following structures-1). Cheeks and lips.2). Vestibule. The vestibule is the space between the lips and teeth3). Teeth. 320328 4). Tongue. Note the taste buds, or papillae, on the upper surface of the tongue. Note that almost theentire tongue is a muscle and the variety of movements pc with it. The tongue is one of themost complex components of the muscular system.5. Hard and soft palates. The hard palate is the roof of the mouth: the soft palate hangs from theback part of the hard palate. Nasopalatine ducts (naso means \"from the nose') open through thefront section of the hard palate. Above and at the end of the hard palate and continuing acrossthe soft palate is part of the pharynx.C. Study the pharynx of your cat. The pharynx is the crossing of air and food passages in an animal.Openings from the nares, ears, mouth, lungs. and stomach all converge in the pharynx.The glottis is a flap of tissue in the pharynx which functions to direct food from the mouth into theesophagus and on to the stomach. or air into the trachea past the glottis and voicebox, or larynx, andon to the lungs.Split the soft palate of the cat for the best observation of the cavity called the nasopharynx in which thetwo eustachian tubes leading from the middle ear cavities open along the lateral walls.You will also see tonsils in the pharynx. They are lymphatic nodules located just past the base of the tongue.D. The esophagus conveys food from the pharynx to the stomach. Study the cat stomach. with the aidof the drawing in figure eight below, which depicts an enlarged cross-section view of the stomach. 6 the esophagus. has deep-branching. columnar mucus glands.The fundus. or middle stomach. has deep gastric pits lined with cuboidal cells. The cells lining the upper halfof the pits are mucus producing chief cells, and those lining the lower half of the pits secrete zymogen, anenzyme precursor which is activated by acidic catalysis. Layered under the chief cells are parietal cells whichsecrete hydrochloric acid. The pylorus. or lower stomach. has deep-branchng mucus glands like the cardiacstomach.E. Take a minute cross-section of the stomach lining, and mount it on a slide with coverslip. Observe thiscross-section mount under both low and high power of the microscope. 321329 21. Draw your stomach lining cross-section in the space provided below. Label all the cell types visible in the slide. 22. From which stomach section did you take your specimen?23. How could you have identified the stomach section from which the specimen had been taken withoutknowing in advance where it came from? 24. From which stomach section was the figure eight drawing taken?25. Draw the entire stomach of your specimen in the space provided below, with its attachments to the esophagusand duodenum. Label the sections of the stomach. , ,322330 F. Cut the small intestine where it joins the stomach. Cut away the mesentery which connects the smallintestine loops and attaches it to the peritoneal membranes. Leave it attached to the large intestine, stretchit out from the body cavity, and measure the small intestine.26. How long is the small intestine of your specimen2The duodenum, which attaches to the stomach, is characterized by the presence of mucus secreting glandscalled Brunner's glands. In cross-section the lining of the duodenum would appear as in the figure nine glands2. Circular3. The ileum, the final section of the small intestine, is characterized by groupings of lymphatic nodulescalled Peyer's patches. Cut a minute cross-section of ileum lining and mount it on a slide with coverslip. Exam-ine it under both low and high power of the microscope.27. Draw in the space provided below what you see in the ileum lining cross-section mount. Label what youcan identify. H. Study the colon. The entrance to the colon from the ileum is guarded by a sphincter valve, the ileocolicsphincter. Cut the colon where it joins the ileum and identify the sphincter. 28. In what direction does the ileocolic sphincter allow material to pas0 29. In the space provided below draw the colon as it lies in the cat. Label all sections of the colon, and showits attachments. Procedure: Hour 5Students need all listed supplies, except the straw.During this laboratory hour you will identify and trace the respiratory and circulatory systems of the cat.StepsA. Completely expose the thoracic cavity. Using bone cutting scissors. cut through the cartilage on bothsides of the sternum. Make an incision at right angles to the sternum between two caudal ribs. Bend back thethoracic walls and break or cut the ribs near the spinal column. This will expose the pleural cavity atlungs. Figure ten on the following page diagrams the thoracic viscera you is the lining of the thoracic cavity and the lung. The parietal pleura lines the cavity. whilevisceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs themselves.B. Review the respiratory structures studied during hour three, and define those terms listed below bydescribing their placement and function in the cat:30. Nares 31. 32. Pharynx 33. Trachea Bronchii branch from the trachea and attach to the lungs, one bronchus, or tube going to each lung. Withinthe lungs, the bronchii subdivide into bronchioles, ultimately terminating in small chambers called vestibuleswhich are bordered by alveoli pockets. 325333 36. The larynx, trachea, and bronchii arm all d by support tissue. What is this support ti,ssue.? The lungs of a cat occupy most of the thoracic cav:ty. The right lung is composed of four lobes and theleft lung has three lobes.C. Section a minute piece of lung tissue and mount it on a slide with coverslip. Observe it under bothlow and high power of the microscope. 37. In the space provided below, draw a clear view of your lung tissue slide. Label all identifiable structures,such as alveoli, vestibules, and bronchioles. D. Using probe and forceps, open the pericardial sac to expose the heart and blood vessels. Notice thatthe pericardium is composed of two membranes, a parietal and a visceral pericardium. similar in structure andfunction to those encompassing the lungs. Locate and study the f -,11-)wing structures. 1).Left and right ventricles. The ventricles are the chambers at the lower apex of the heart. 2).Left and right atria. The atria are thinner walled chambers which sit like caps on top of the ventri-cles. Covering the atria are small muscular lobes, called auricles, which extend downwards overpart of each ventricle.3). The pulmonary arch. The pulmonary arch passes between the two auricles. and branches into rightand left pulmonary arteries, which further subdivide before reaching the lungs.4). The aorta. The aorta is a large arch beginning at the left ventricle. If your specimen is fat, it maybe necessary to remove some fatty deposits before the aorta is visible.5). Veins. Caudal and cranial vena cavae enter the right atrium. Pulmonary veins enter the left atrium. 326334 The following figure eleven diagram will aid in your study of the cat's artery1219. Right tricuspid valve20. Right ventricle21. Vein Figure 11 E. Cut the pulmonary arch, the vena cavae. the pulmonary veins. and the aortic arch close to the heartand remove the heart. Loosen and then pull out the latex probably remaining in the stub of the aortic archof your cats heart. The latex will contain a negative impression of the semilunar valve of the aorta. Slice theheart transversely through the wall of each atrium down to the apex of the ventricles. Using forceps, washand pick out the clotted blood. Locate and identify the following structures.1). Tricuspid valve. This valve prevents blood in the right ventricle from entering the right atrium. Theflaps of the valve are held to the walls of the right ventricle by chordae tendinae, which areattached by raised bundles of muscle. Even though tricuspid valves have three flaps (hence thename), the flaps are difficult to distinguish in a cat.2). Pulmonary semilunar valve and aortic semilunar valve. These valves are found between thepulmonary arch and the right ventricle, and between the aortic arch and the left ventricle.respectively. Note their shape. and compare them with the negative impression in the latex pulledfrom the stub of the aortic arch. 327335 38. Draw the pulmonary and aortic semilunar valves in the space provided below. 39. Are they similar?3). Bicuspid valve. This valve is similar to the tricuspid, except that it has two flaps instead of three.The two flaps should be visible in your specimen.40. In the space provided below. draw both the bicuspid and tricuspid valves of your cat's heart. Label them. 41. Are they similar? 328336 F. Study the figure twelve diagram of cat arteries. Using probe and forceps, identify the major arteries ofthe cat the figure thirteen chart below.Artery Location OriginInnominateCarotidCranial thyroidLingualCeliacRenalIliacFemoralLumbarGonadalFigure 13 G. Study the figure fifteen diagram (on following page) of veins ald glands in a cat. Using probe andforceps, identify the major veins and glands of your specimen. Very little dissection will be necessary to exposethe veins, since they usually accompany the arteries.43. Complete the figure fourteen chart below.Vein Location OriginVena 14 330338 6Students need all listed supplies.During this laboratory hour you will locate and study the urinary and reproductive organs of a cat.StepsA. Locate the kidneys embedded in fat on the dorsal body wall. Remove the fat surrounding the kidneys,without damaging the adrenals and blood vessels in the area. Note where the ureters attach to the kidneys.Cut one ureter as it exits a kidney, and cut the blood vessels that attach to the kidney. Remov2 the kidneyfrom the body cavity. Longitudinally slice the kidney in ha!!, in order to see the following sections.1). Adrenal gland. Review hour three procedure.2). Cortex. The cortex is the outer region of the kidney which contains blood filtering mechanisms.It should be distinguishable by color from the inner kidney region, the medulla.3). Medulla. The medulla is the inner region of the kidney. It contains the collecting ducts which carryurine from the cortex. The ducts merge into larger ducts and empty into the funnel-shaped renal pelvis.4). Renal pelvis. The renal pelvis is a collecting area for urine just before it is funneled into the ureter.5).1-li lus. The hilus is the region where blood vessels enter and leave the kidney. 44. In the space provided below, draw your cat's sectioned kidney, and label all parts. B. Take a straw and place one end in the cut ureter left in the cat's body cavity. Gently blow into the straw.The urinary bladder should swell like a balloon, making it easy to distinguish.The bladder is a reservoir for urine discharged through the urethra. Because it is held to the ventral bodywall by a mesentery suspensory ligament, it might be difficult to find because, in exposing the body cavity,the suspensory ligiment was probably cut, thus collapsing the bladder. 340332 C. Depending upon the sex of your cat. identify the following reproductive organs. When you have com-pleted this reproductive dissection. compare cats with another laboratory group which has a cat of the oppositesex. In this fashion you should complete both male and female reproductive sections of this laboratory.Male Organs;with the aid of figure sixteen. identify the following 1). Scrotum. The scrotum is a sac of muscle and connective. tissue on the outside of the body, justventral to the anus, which surrounds the testes. All mammals carry the scrotum on the outside ofthe body, so that the testes will not overheat, because sperm remain alive only at a temperature lowerthan body temperature. Remove the scrotum from the cat's body, and slice it in half. Find the testes,paired reproductive glands within the scrotum. Find the coiled epididyrnis, leading into the spermaticcord which extends from the testes into the abdominal cavity of the cat. The spermatic cord is com-posed of a duct from the epididymis, spermatic artery and vein, and a nerve, bound together in a sheath.45. Draw a sectioned view of the cat's scrotum in the space provided below. Label all structures exposed inyour dissection. 2). Prostate glands. The prostates are small bulb-shaped glands covered by striated muscles. They arelocated on either side of the urethra near the entrance of an epididymal duct, the ductus deferens.The prostate orchestrates the release of either semen (sperm) or urine from the penis.3). Penis. The enlarged distal end is called the glans. A male cat has a baculum, or penis bone. Removethe penis and cross-section it. In the center area you should see three cavernous bodies. These sinusesare what engorge with blood when the male cat is sexually aroused. On either side of the penis wheremuscles attach to the penis, you should see two small glands, Cowper's glands. Cowper's glands dis-charge stored sperm into the urethral tubes.46. Diagram and label the structures you have located in the cat's penis in the space provided below. 334342 Female Organs: with the aid of figure seventeen, identify the following structures. Figure 171. Anal gland 1). Ligaments. There are several broad ligaments supporting female reproductive organs, such as the ovaries.uterine tubes. and uterus. These ligaments are attached to the dorsal body wall and should still bein place. Another ligament supports the uterus ventrally (although it was cut when opening the cavity).and small ovarian ligaments hold the ovaries in place.2). Ovaries. Ovaries are the female reproductive glands. The eggs develop in the ovaries by meioticdivisions inside fluid-filled chambers called follicles. The follicles enlarge as the eggs within themmature. Mature follicles are known as Graafian follicles. After the egg erupts (ovulation), the walls,or scar tissue of the erupted follicle, become the corpus luteum. Eventually the corpus luteumdegenerates. The corpus luteum produces female sex hormones. Slice a minute section from oneovary, and mount it on a slide with a coverslip. Study this section under both low and high powerof a microscope. 3353.4 3 47. Draw and label what you see in the cat's sectioned ovary in the space provided below. 3). Uterus. Uterine tubes (oviducts) connect the cat's ovaries to the uterus. The cat uterus has twosections or horns, called comu, joined caudally, just before the terminal chamber of the femalereproductive tract, the vagina. Use bone cutting scissors to cut away the bone (the ischium and thepubis) overlying these organs.4). Vestibule. The vagina and the urethra both empty into the vestibule, a chamber common to boththe reproductive and excretory systems. Dorsal to the vestibule are the anal glands which scentthe female. In the floor of the vestibule near the opening of the urethra you will find the clitorus.The clitorus is the counterpart of the male penis, and it is composed of two sinus bodies anda small bone, the os clitoris. Itis difficult for a beginner to dissect a cat's clitorus. The walls ofthe external opening of the vestibule are raised into flaps called vulvae.Procedure: Hour 7Students need all listed supplies, except the straw.During this laboratory hour you will identify and trace the nervous system of a cat.StepsA. Use bone cutting scissors to cut and chip your way into the cranial cavity of your specimen. Older catshave harder crania than younger ones, and some students may need to ask an industrial arts student orinstructor for use of an electric saw. Be careful not to cut into the brain itself. After opening the cranium, chipoff the remaining roof of the cranium with forceps. Leave the eyes and ears intact for future study. Use figureeighteen to locate and study the following structures. 336344 1. The meninges are membranes that cover the brain. All mammals have three layers ofmembranes. The outermost layer is called the dura mater. The arachnoid, or middle, layer is anetwork of thin delicate fibers. The innermost layer is called the pia mater: it is stuck to the brain itself.2).Olfactory bulb. The olfactory nerves terminate here after their journey from the nares.3).Cerebrum. The cerebrum, or center of intelligence, consists of two halves, or hemispheres, dividedby a deep groove called the sagittal fissure. The floor of the sagittal fissure is called the corpus callosum.The corpus callosum is a band of nerve fibers connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres.4).Cerebellum. The cerebellum is a very convoluted part of the brain. It is caudal, or behind, thecerebrum. There are two pairs of lobes between the cerebrum and cerebellum called the corporaquadrigemina. They serve as optic reflex centers for the cat.5). Medulla oblongata. The medulla oblongata is the most caudal portion of the brain. and constrictsinto the spinal cord.It is difficult to remove the brain from the cranium without destroying the parts you wish to study. Theinstructor and/or students may wish, as a demonstration or optional activity, to remove the brain from thecranium. Slice both ventral and sagittal sections of the brain and study what is exposed.B. Study the cat's eye. Notice the upper and lower eyelids, and a small fold of tissue at the corner of theeye. A very thin membrane, the conjunctiva. covers th (.. tenor of the eyeball and the inner margin of theeyelids. Remove the eyelids and the skin around the eye as Tar as the ear. Locate the following external structures(in addition to those studied during hour one):1).Eye muscles. Notice that the muscles attached to the eye, with one exception, all originate nearone spot. This spot also is where the optic nerve attaches the eye to the brain.2).Lacrimal glands. These are found near the corner of the eye.3). Harderian gland. The Harderian gland is a the front, or external, partof the eyeball.48. In the space provided below, draw the eye so as to show muscles and glands. Label these structures. 338-'346 C. Remove the eyeball from the optic foramen (the orbit of the cranium ineye muscles and optic nerve. Locate the sclera, the tough, white, fibrous outercornea, the exposed transparent continuation of the sclera.D. Cut the eyeball in half in a plane parallel to the optic nerve and locatenineteen for help in identification. 10which it rests) by cutting thelayer of the eyeball, and the the following. Refer to figure 1. Anterior chamber2. 1). Blind spot. The blind spot is where the optic nerve enters the retina.2). Retina. The retina is the light sensitive, yellow tissue which coats the interior chamber of the eye.The retina is a complex tissue layer composed of rods and cones (special cells for sight and color),nerve fibers, and pigments. The fovea centralis is a specialized area of the retina directly behindthe pupil. The interior chamber of the eye is filled with vitreous humor, a jelly-like substance whichprovides shape to the eye. The vitreous humor clings together in a vitreous body, and it probablyfell out of the eye when you sliced into it.3). Choroid. Underneath the retina of the eye is the choroid layer. After the choroid layer is the sclera.Choroid tissue is black except for the portion directly behind the pupil, which is a metallic blue-green. This area is called the tapetum lucidurn. The tapetum reflects light back through the retinaand out the pupil. The ciliary body is an enlargement of the choroid between the iris and choroidproper. The ciliary body contains a muscle which controls eye lens movement. The iris is also acontinuation of the choroid. The iris is a pigmented partition pierced by the pupil. It separates theanterior and posterior chambers of the eye. 339.347i 4 4). Lens. The lens is a spherical clear body in the center of the eyeball. The lens is attached to the ciliarybody by a suspensory ligament. The lens is separated from the ciliary body by a space called the posteriorchamber, and from the cornea of the eye by an anterior chamber bounded by the iris and pupil. Ifthe vitreous body fell out of your eye. the lens might well have fallen with it. Find the lens and washit clean of vitreous humor. You can use the lens of the eye like a magnifying glass. Place the lensover this printed page and see how it magnifies.49. How many times does the lens magnify the print on this page?5).Pupil. The pupil is tne opening through the center of the iris. Cats can see very well in the dark, inpart because of the way in which their pupils are constructed. In the cat. the pupil is a vertical slitand dilates to a large, round opening in the dark. Such a large opening is not possible in a roundpupil. such as that found in humans.E. Study the cat's ear. The external ear consists of the pinnae (flaps) and a canal. The canal is called theexternal auditory meatus. and it leads to the eardrum. or tympanum. Refer to your drawing completed duringhour one.F. Cut away the external ear and eardrum to reach the middle ear. You should see two round, window-hke holes covered by thin membranes. These are the fenestra rotunda and the fenestra ovalis. The fenestrarotunda is found in the dorsal wall of the middle ear, and the fenestra ovalis is found near the stirrup boneof the middle ear. The middle ear contains three bones, the malleus (hammer), incus (anvil), and the stapes(stirrup). The eustachian tube opens the middle ear to the nasopharynx cavity. Refer to figure 20 for aid inear structure identification. 1. inner ear is very small and difficult to dissect. The instructor and/or students may wish, as a demon-stration or optional activity, to remove the petrous bone containing the inner ear, and locate the following struc-tures: the cochlea, utricle, saccule, and the semicircular canals.Procedure: Hour 8Students need the following supplies: cat, dissecting pan. probe, forceps. and dissecting scissors.During this laboratory hour you will study the skeleton of a cat.A. Remove the remaining flesh from your specimen. The fleshing of an animal is critical to preparing askeleton. Take care not to cut through any remaining ligaments which hold the bones in position.If you were to prepare a skeleton for permanent mounting, you would select a fresh, mature cat whosecarcass had not been dissected. Your specimen, at a minimum, has a cracked cranium and broken ribs.B. The bones are connected by joints or articulations. Joints allow bones to be moved in one, two. orthree directions. There are six joint types. They are spheroidal (ball and socket). ellipsoidal and sellar (saddle-shaped), ginglymus (hinge), trocoid (pivot), and arthroidal (plane) joints. Study the joints connecting the bonesof your specimen. 50. Identify the joint types in the joints listed in figure twenty-one below. Also state whether they can be movedin one. two, or three planes or directions. Joint Type Planes Of Movement Hip Knee Wrist Shoulder.. Humerus & Ulna Radius & Ulna Figure 21 341349 C. Study figure twenty-two below, a lateral view of a cat skeleton, and find on your specimen the listed bones. 1111I locate, and state the function of the bones listed in figure twenty-three below. Bone Location Function Radius Ulna 23 Bones are for protection and/or support. The skeleton of mammals is considered to consist of two sec-tions, the axial and the appendicular. The axial skeleton consists of the skull, facial bones, vertebral column.ribs, and sternum. The appendicular skeleton is composed of the shoulder and hip girdles and their appendages.341,5 2 D. Study the bones of the head. Locate the following bones.1). Cranium. The cranium encloses the brain. You had to crack it in order to view the brain duringlaboratory hour seven. The cranium consists of several fused bone structures. The frontal bonescover the area from the cat's eye (zygomatic arch) and have processes (knobs that stick out). Parie-tal bones cover the back section of the skull, and end in a sagittal crest. The occipital bone coversthe mosti:audal area, and it is attached to the spinal vertebrae. The temporal bones cover the sideof the skull to the ear area.52. In the space provided below, draw the skull of your cat and label the bones that comprise it. 2).Facial bones. The facial bones consist of the nasals (paired bones roofing the ethmoid process ofthe occipital skull region), the palatines (forming the hard palate of the mouth), the mandible orjawbone, the teeth and the bones that contain them, the bones of the ear, and the lacrimals (smallpaired bones which border the lacrimal gland near the eye).53. In the space provided below draw a frontal view of your cat's skull, and label the visible facial bones. 344353 Optional Dissection Activity The entire articulated skeleton of a cat may be constructed and mounted according to the followingprocedures. The instructor may wish to demonstrate these procedures, or students may wish to proceed withthem. submitting their skeletons to the instructor for evaluation.A. Examine the fleshed bones of the specimen to be sure that most of the natural cartilage and ligamentsare intact. Place the bones in a large container and cover them with water. The container must be stone.earthenware, glass. or plastic. Do not use a metal or wooden container. Keep the container in a warm roomor incubator where an average temperature of 25 to 28\u00b0 C. is maintained for six to eight days. The remainingflesh on the bones will rot. or macerate. The process is complete when the flesh gels and sloughs off the boneseasily. but the ligaments holding the skeleton together are still intact.B. Remove the bones from their maceration bath. and rinse under running water. scrubbing them witha toothbrush to remove all remaining pieces of flesh. To halt any final maceration. place the scrubbed bonesin a weak caustic soda solution (9 grams caustic soda per liter of water) for one to two hours. Wash the bonesin running water.C. Run a stiff pointed wire through the specimen's vertebrae. forcing the point well into the sacrum. Bendthe vertebral column to its natural shape. Space the ribs equally along the vertebral column by stringing themwith thread. Hold the limbs together with wire and a cork or wood support. Wire any other loose bonestogether in proper position. Allow the skeleton to dry for two weeks.D. The bones will still be greasy after drying. Place the skeleton in a TF solvent bath for six to eight hours.TF solvent, or trichlorotrifluoroethane (TTE), costs more than carbon tetrachloride. but it is very much saferfor students to use. The alternative is to soak the skeleton in carbon tetrachloride for the same period of time.E. Remove the skeleton from the solvent bath and plunge it into a hot (but not boiling) water/ammoniabath for five to ten minutes. The waterammonia bath solution should contain 0.5 liters ammonia solutionin every three liters water. If it is desired to have a perfectly white skeleton. remove the bones from the waterbath and place them in a ten per cent solution of hydrogen peroxide for four hours.F. Mount the specimen using stiff wires and metal rods and attaching the specimen to a bottom board.Mounting or putting together any model is largely a matter of experience and skill. and time and patienceMust be applied. If you wish. a glass case may also be constructed to protect the specimen from dust andcareless handling. ResourcesEisenberg. Mickey S.. Lawrence Bergner. Alfred P. Hallstrom. and Richard 0.

LaboratoryAnimal Behavior When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to: 1.Explain the theoretical difference between innate andlearned behavior.2.Define taxis and state three types of stimuli which cancause a taxic response.3.Describe conflict behavior and explain why it is thought tobe important in the development of threat displays andcourtship behavior.4.Describe how threat and appeasement behavior helpmaintain a dominance hierarchy.5.Describe territorial behavior.6.Describe social behavior and give two examples of thecommunication patterns involved. Man's Best FriendHumans often fallaciously assume that animals act because of emotions and drives similar to those of man.We tend to think. for instance, that a dog displays shame when it puts its tail between its legs or crawls onits belly after receiving discipline from its master. What we actually observe in such cases are appeasementdisplays innate to social mammals. The dog thereby reaffirms its acceptance of subordination in the human/dogsociety in which it exists. All domesticated mammals derive from social species in which hierarchial positionis communicated by innate behavior. This behavior should not be confused with human emotions. rather weneed to understand the animal in its own terms.EthologyMan has observed animals since before the dawn of written history. Prehistoric man painted animals oncave walls. the Chinese developed metaphors of animal behavior to describe human relations. and Greeksbelieved in gods whose half animal bodies symbolized that god's powers. The Greek philosopher Aristotlewrote a book which focused on animal behavior. Aesop told tales about animals. and he. as did his people.made inferences about human behavior from what they had observed among animals. Medieval Japanesescroll paintings and stories employed animals to satirize human foibles. as did the modern writer George Orwellin Animal Farm. Most of this human observing and commenting has failed to deal with the animal in termsof the animal. The focus. rather. has been upon man and how the animal impacts human society.Ethology, a word first used shortly after 1850. applies to the study of animals under natural conditions.Europeans. such as the Austrians Konrad Lorenz and Karl von Frisch. pioneered the use of careful, systematicobservations to explain animal behavior. with observations and experiments employed to test hypotheses theyhad developed. For their Lvork. Konrad Lorenz. the Nobel Prize in 1973. Konrad Lorenz is known as the \"father of ethology.- 349358 Many animal behaviorists have emulated Lorenz's methods of scientific field research. Jane Goodall of GreatBritain, who was supported by the National Geographic Society under the aegis of Louis Leakey. spent mostof her adult life studying the habits of chimpanzees. Dian Fossey, an American who was similarly funded andsupported. opened our eyes to the intricate society of the mountain gorilla, before she was hacked to deathby poachers.Animal Behavior in the LaboratoryAt the same time that ethology was being developed as a science by Europeans. an American school ofanimal psychologists pursued the goal of learning about animal behavior under controlled laboratory conditions.This behaviorist school was strongly influenced by Ivan Petrovich Pavlov. a Russian physiologist (1849-1936)whose classic studies on dog responses are still pertinent. B. Frederic Skinner of Harvard University pioneeredmechanized tests of both animal and human behavior. Harry F. Harlow, director of the Primate Laboratoryat the University of Wisconsin. studied parent/child bonding with newborn rhesus monkeys and artificial motherfigures made of wire, baby bottles, and sometimes terrycloth.Many scientists today employ a variety of methods in their observations on animal behavior. Donald R.Griffin, at the Tropical Research Station of the New York Zoological Society in Trinidad, theorized that batsmake use of stimuli beyond the range of human sense organs, and he proved his theory by recording ultrasonicsounds bats emit to locate objects as they fly, a sonar-like mechanism. Theodore C. Schneirla. of the AmericanMuseum of Natural History in New York City, combined years of field work with laboratory experiments tobecome an ant expert. He discovered the phenomena of chemically-driven ant suicide, in which ants blindlyfollow their chemical scent, even until death if the pheronomes have been laid down in a circle.Kjell Sandved. one of the world's leading nature photographers who works from the Smithsonian's Museumof Natural History in Washington D.C., has documented moth behavior in over thirty countries, as well asphotographing natural phenomena as diverse as Bronze Age man near the Dead Sea and the wildlife ofMadagascar. He has provided a visual study guide for those interested in life.Patterns of ResponseBehaviorists have articulated three response patterns which contribute to a specie's survival. First. an animalmust be able to discriminate between important and unimportant stimuli in order to survive or reproduce. Forexample, chicken hens which lay eggs in response to longer-light days. even though not fertilized by a rooster.would not be aiding in the survival of the species, if in a natural environment (refer to laboratory twenty-four).Second. behavior patterns must allow an animal to solve immediate problems. such as feeding when hungry,or escaping when threatened by predators. Once-adaptive response patterns can become inappropriate, suchas the circling behavior of Arctic-musk oxen. which protects calves and cows from wolves but which also groups. the bulls for easy slaughter by humans with rifles.Third. behavior patterns will be naturally selected as they contribute over time to an organism's reproduc-tive success. For example, Niko Tinbergen, a leading Dutch ethologist at Oxford University. has demonstratedthat black-headed gulls which do rot remove empty eggshells from the nest lose more chicks to predation.apparently because the solidly white interior of the speckled eggshell helps predators spot a nest with chicks.Most black-headed gulls instinctively remove eggshells shortly after hatching.Instinctive versus Learned BehaviorMembers of the same or similar species tend to show the same inherited behavior whether they aredomesticated or wild. Thus. the domestic dog displays social behavior interited from tv:Id ancestors. Thesetypes of behavior are consideted to be innate, or instinctive. Learned behavior, on the other hand, results fromadjustment to a new environment. To a dog. the human master substitutes for the pack's alpha animal. A barking.trick-performing seal at a show certainly has learned a new form of feeding behavior. Of course, learned behaviorscan become integral. if the stimulus remains the same. For example. humans do not consciously think aboutthe muscles required to write or ride a bicycle. but once mastered the appropriate neural sequencing remainsengrained. Animals with longer life spans tend to acquire more learned behaviors. 350359 In this laboratory you will observe animal behavior during four mini-labs, each of which is separable andexpandable into lengthy experiments of many months duration. These four hours introduce some aspects-ofboth laboratory and field research into animal behavior. You will work with fruit flies. Siamese fighting fish.chickens, and honey bees. If it is not possible to undertake one of the sessions, use those which are practicalin your locality.Pre-labSupplies needed: Equipmentwatches or stopwatchesGlass crayons. or markersSpecial Preparations 1)Drosophila culture: fruit flies may be caught in season, or purchased from biological supply houses.If you are running this experiment in Minneapolis during the winter, for example, you had best purchase thefruit flies. To catch fruit flies, use any fermenting fruit. but ripe banana is excellent. To speed the fermentingprocess. dip a piece of ripe fruit in a yeast suspension made by dissolving yeast in warm water. Place a pieceof paper toweling, which will absorb excess liquid, into the bottom of a milk bottle or vial. Then insert the yeastcovered fruit. Leave the container open to attract flies. When the fruit flies have begun to feed on your attractant.plug the neck of the glass container with cotton wrapped in cheese cloth.If either purchased or captured fruit flies have to be held longer than two or three days. you will needto prepare a medium which will not liquify and drown the flies (rotting banana, for example. liquifies in a fewdays). Prepare 50 to 60 ml. of medium for each container. Heat the medium close to boiling, and pour itinto sterile vials or small milk bottles. Insert a strip of paper toweling into the medium while it is still soft, withan end of the toweling sticking out to provide surface area for egg laying and pupation. Cap the bottles. andallow the medium to solidify on a slant. to provide more surface area for feeding. These containers with mediumcan be prepared well in advance of fruit fly arrival, if refrigerated.To transfer captured flies to the prepared-medium container, place the new container upside down overthe unplugged trap. and fruit flies will fly up into the new container.Medium: dissolve 15 g agar in 480 ml. water. Stir well and heat to boiling. Add 500 g. mashed bananaOr. if bananas are unavailable, add 135 ml. corn syrup or molasses and 100 g. cornmeal dissolved in 27()ml cold water. Gently boil the whole mixture for about five minutes. If desired. add a mold inhibitor accordingto package directions The mold inhibitor is optional. but recommended for hot. humid climates. Mold inhibitors.such as Tegosept M (methyl paraben), are available from biological supply houses :151:I;I.. 2) Chickens or other fowl:for imprinting to be successful, chicks newly emerged from their shellmust be used. This laboratory hour must take precedence over any other activity. It must run asthe chicks hatch(see laboratory twenty-four). Most laboratories can be re-scheduled or interrupted, but notthis one.3) Male Siamese fighting fish must be kept in separate aquaria or compartments. All visual contactbetween individual fish should be blocked until the experiment. They may be purchased from tropical fish storesor biological supply houses. Water temperature of all aquaria or containers should be similar (25\u00b0 C.) so thatthe fish do not suffer temperature shock during introduction. Also. prepare the water by aeration for a day,or use a dechlorinating agent. before introducing the fish. If the aquaria or jars are tiny. loosely cover themso that the fish will not jump out. Air pumps are required to keep the fish any length of time, but they arenot essential in the short term of one week or less. Siamese fighting fish are able to gulp air from the water'ssurface and store the air in a pair of internal chambers above the gills. Filled with thin plates covered with fine.blood vessels. these auxiliary breathing organs provide for a direct exchange of oxygen and waste gases.During the laboratory fighting fish models w e made, unless you wish to prepare them in advance. Useany waterproof. stiff material. Thick plastic is ideal but not always available. Fabric stores regularly stock heavy.nonwoven interfacing, a washable material used to stiffen collars and form flannel board figures. When coloredwith permanent fabric markers, they may be c:eaned and reused for many years. Each student group maywish to make their own, or the instructor may wish to provide uniform fighting fish models for the class asa whole. The models will be lowered into the aquaria by transparent line during the laboratory.4) Bees: bees and hives are available from biological supply houses. mail-order houses, and local beekeepers.Some local beekeepers are happy to care for hives in exchange for their honey harvest. If purchase and main-tenance of a hive are not practical. temporarily borrow a beehive locating a willing lender through the localapiary society. Beekeepers usually are delighted with interest shown in their avocation and are excellent sourcesof practical information.Bee veils are not essential for the type of hive observation to be performed during the laboratory. but theycan comfort the timid student or inexperienced instructor. Careless approach or careless observation of thehive might lead to a bee sting. Before students get near the hive, check to see if any of them have a knownallergy to bee stings. In any event. have an injection of adrenalin available in case a stung student suffers ageneralized allergic reaction. Effective epinephrine injection kits are available from pharmacies and doctors.If refrigerated. epinephirine injection kits are viable for up to one year.Observation bee hives are fascinating additions to biology programs. They provide a long-term source ofinterest for very little effort. Time RequiredThe animal behavior laboratory requires four classroom hours, in addition to preparations, discussion,and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the following: Drosophila culture. food vials and stoppers. glass Y's to fit the vials withstoppers. rotten fruit, ammonia, black paper. aluminum foil. filter paper. watch, light source. and masking tape.During this laboratory hour you will study taxis in fruit flies. Taxis is any orientation behavior in which thereis a sustained movement either toward or away from a stimulus. Taxic responses are termed phototaxic if thestimulus is light. geotaxic if the stimulus is gravity, and chemotaxic if the stimulus is chemical in nature. :352361 StepsA. Put five or seven flies in a dean vial (this move can be a challenge to the less well coordinated). Coverthe opening with another vial of the same size. and tape the vial openings together so that the flies can movefreely in both vials. Cover the taped vials with black paper so that only one of the ends opens to the light.and lay it down horizontally. Place a light source near the open end of the vials, and. wait three minutes.Quickly and with as little disturbance as possible, remove the paper and count the number of flies in eachsection of the tube.1. How many flies were in the section closest to the light source? 2. How many flies were in the section farthest from the light source? B. Repeat the experiment twice more. 3. Record your results in the chart, figure one. below. Trial Near Light Source Near Closed End 1 2 3 Figure 1 4. Do fruit flies show positive or negative phototaxis? 5. Why was it important to keep the vials in a horizontal position during the experiment? C Temporarily remove the black paper and allow the five to seven flies inside the taped vials time to alighton the glass and come to rest. Once at rest cover the vials completely with black paper. Hold the vials verticallyfor three minutes.

Explain how you would dothis in the space provided below. E. Set up a T maze using three vials and stoppers and the Y glass to join them. according to figure threeon the following page. Place a small piece of fermenting fruit smeared on a small square of filter paper inone vial before attaching it to the T maze. nine to thirteen flies in another vial before attachment. and asmall square of moistened filt, r paper in the third vial.

Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following: hatching chickens hatching fowl), and brooder with food andwater trays.During this laboratory period you will observe chicks (or other fowl) hatching. and you will attempt to imprintyourself as a chick surrogate parent. Step A must be completed prior to the imprinting laboratory hour.StepBis best accomplished when the chick is between ten and sixteen hours old. ImprintingImprinting, the rapid. early learning of behavior appropriate to the species, has been observed in insects.fish, birds. and mammals. although it has been studied most extensively in birds. Human infant bonding patternsand earliest behavior are undergoing extensive research. and behavior similar to that observed in birds hasbeen noted. Imprinting became widely known as a result of the work of Konrad Lorenz, who first used theterm technically in 1937. Lorenz is perhaps best known for demonstrating that goslings follow the first movingobject seen mmediately after hatching.Lorenz also discovered that there is a relationship between imprinting and sexual behavior in male birds.For example, a male Chinese pheasant will provide a courtship display to objects similar to that to which hewas imprinted as a chick. Lorenz imprinted himself as parent to a male jackdaw. and when the bird achievedsexual maturity, the jackdaw kept trying to stuff worms in Lorenz's ear in a misplaced effort at courtship. Thisoccurred before Lorenz had made the connection between imprinting and adult sexual behavior.Some birds are easier to imprint than others, and the instinct seems to be genetically conditioned. Experi-ments have been run variously on chickens, ducks. and geese, with the more easily imprintable of the speciesseparated from the more difficult, and the separate groups then inbred. The offspring displayed imprintingcapability very close to that of the parents.StepsA. This first step in the procedure likely will not take place during a scheduled laboratory period.Whenever hatching begins in a clutch of eggs, students should observe further hatching through the incubator'swindow or plastic cover. without removing the lid. Hatching cannot be orchestrated. and whenever it occurs.students will have to make themselves available. Do not remove the lid of the incubator because both hatchedand unhatched chicks are very susceptible to chilling during this period. Chicl.s can live 48 hours before requiringfood and water, so do not attempt immediately to feed them.21. What kinds of movements do the chicks employ in getting out of the shelf ..356365 22. Study the empty shell. Draw the pieces in the space provided below. 23. Describe the pattern in which the egg was cracked 24. Do you think all bird's eggshells are cracked in the same manner? Why or why not? 25. Can you cite any evidence for your statement?. If so, what? B. As some students will have to crawl on the floor, they should come to class in casual dress, or perhapsuse a large, washable throw rug or blanket. Students need to work in groups of at least two, because whileone student attempts to become the chick's surrogate parent. another student must record the chick's actionsand reactions.Imprinting behavior is strongest in chicks ten to sixteen hours old. Select..the chick you will attempt to imprint.The surrogate parent should gently pick up the chick from the incubator. and cuddle it in the hands. Softlyand rhythmically talk to the chick, repeating over and over the name you have decided to call it. Slowly moveto your prepared work area of the room.C. Place the chick on a soft floor surface, keeping your hands cuddled around it. Continue to call softlyto it. After a few minutes, move your cupped hands twenty to thirty centimeters away. Coax the chick to walktowards your hands by calling to it and moving your hands slowly back and forth. When the chick takes astep or two in the direction of your hands, reward it by cuddling it some more. Set it down and repeat theprocedure. Keep moving your hands farther and farther away each time you repeat the procedure. Be patient.Hand imprinting should take ten or fifteen minutes to accomplish. 357...366 26. In the space provided below, record what the chick does during hand imprinting. Record whether or notit stands. sits, or makes random or purposeful movements. such as those toward or away from the surrogateparent. Record these movements minute by minute. D. When the chick has been trained to come to your hands. it then needs to be trained to focus on anotherpart of your body. People are very large compared to chicks. and the chick must learn to associate your feetwith the parent surrogate. as well as your hands, so that the chick can be trained to follow you.Put the chick down by your heel. and take one small step while calling to it. Wait until it catches up toyou. then take another step. Gradually increase the speed and length of your steps. making sure the chickcan keep up Continue softly calling as you walk. Eventually the chick should follow you wherever you go. 358367 27. In the space provided below, record what the chick does durino heel imprinting. Record whether or notit stands, sits, or makes random or purposeful movements, such as those toward or away from the surrogateparent. Record these movements minute by minute. 28. Compare your chick imprinting observations with those of other students. Did the chicks all show similartypes of movements? Comment: 29. How many times was each chick cuddled? How long did hand imprinting take in each group? Answerthese questions in the chart. figure five. 359 Group Times Cuddled Imprinting TimeYour Group Figure 5Optional ActivitiesStudents may wish to explore some variables concerning imprinting and chick behavior. They can submittheir results to the instructor in a formal laboratory report.1) Formally observe the imprinted chick with its surrogate parent for at least one week. Does it continueto follow the surrogate parent? What sorts of behaviors on the part of the surrogate parent tend to reinforceimprinting behavior? Compare your findings with other student groups.2) After completing procedures in this laboratory. try to imprint older or younger chicks. Does there appearto be a critical period during which imprinting occurs? Compare imprinting success with chick age.3) At about two weeks of age chicks no longer need artificial heat, over and above room temperature.At that time provide a number of them with a box to live in. a penned enclosure, and food and water. Markeach of them on the back with a different color. so that you can tell them apart. (Fat magic markers workwell). Formally observe chick behavior at the same time for the same period each day. and record yourobservations. Can you determine a pecking order? How did it evolve? Compare chick growth and developmentwith their position in the pecking order.4) You can also run preference tests on the chicks. What are their color preferences? Make small construc-tion paper boxes of different colors and design an experiment to test which box gets pecked at most often.and the order of pecks each colored box receives. Change the order of the boxes. Does the position of thecolored box affect its pecking order? 360369 5) Vary the above experiment by making different shaped objects. such as rectangles, squares, triangles,hexagonals, etc.. all of the same color. Determine which shape gets pecked most often and the packing orderof the shapes. Does the position of the shape affect its pecking preferability?6) Raise a chick at home. When it is an adult, introduce it to a flock of chickens. Observe its behavior.Does it relate well to other chickens. or does it show identity confusion? What do you observe? How longdoes it take to integrate into the flock? What is its position in the flock pecking order? Compare its adult behaviorto that of other chickens in the flock.7) Attempt to imprint yourself as a surrogate parent to a mammal. This has been successfully accomplishedwith guinea pigs.Procedure: Hour 3Students need the following: two male Siamese fighting fish, two small aquaria with heaters and pumps,hand mirror. plastic transparent thread or fine line, fabric markers. scissors. and heavy. nonwoven interfacing fabric.During this laboratory hour you will observe fish bred for exaggerated conflict, or agonistic display. Agonisticbehavior in these fish is stimulated by protective territorial instincts. Protection of offspring. territoriality, andcourtship, all are expressed in conflict.Siamese Fighting FishSiamese fighting fish. Betta splendens. belong to the Asiatic family Anabantidae. They live naturally inthe tropical freshwater streams of Southeast Asia. Fish available for purchase have been bred not only for theirbeautiful colors, most notably the tail. but also for exaggerated conflict behavior displays. The male fish showsits intention to attack another male. or to flee, by visual dispays. Normally the fish is as drab as the female.or only slightly colored, and it keeps its dorsal and ventral fins folded. During displays fighting fish often becomebrilliantly iridescent. Some of these displays are illustrated in figure six. Resting or SubmissiveBroadside Display Figure 6Frontal Attack One of the male fish will eventually intimidate the other and bluff its competitor into leaving the territory.When the fish are housed in aquaria, the intimidated fish unfortunately cannot leave, and the winner will chaseand bite the losing fishIn your experiment, you must be ready to remove one of the fish as soon as thewinner is apparent. 361370 The decision to fight or flee is strongly dependent on whether it is in its own established territory, and whetherit has just defeated another fish or has just been defeated itself. The most impressive displays are observedwith closely matched fish.Nest DefendersSome fish which have not evolved other means to guarantee survival of the next generation achieve thissurvival by protecting nest and territory. Male Siamese fighting fish are well known for guarding their nestswith ferocity. This ferocity can be misplaced, but the initial behavior is one of protection.During courtship the male chases, nips and butts, and eventually reduces the female to submissiveness.Male Siamese fighting fish maintain visual display during mating, and the female must make herself as incon-spicuous as possible to avoid being attacked. The male wraps itself around the female and appears to squeezethe eggs out of her body. The male fertilizes the sinking eggs, and then grabs the eggs in its mouth and fetchesthem to a floating mucous bubble nest it has previously built. The male then guards the eggs against all territorialinvaders, including the mother. It will continue this vigil until the hatched fry are six days old.This ferocious defense of territory and young can be stimulated in response to any territorial invasion, by otherSiamese fighting fish or by artificial stimuli. Artificial stimuli, such as models or brightly colored objects. are mosteffective if the fish has recently defeated another fish and is in its own territory with 'she motivation to display high.StepsA. Place a male fighting fish in an aquarium, and observe its normal behavior. Place a second male fightingfish in the aquarium, and observe the behavior of both. Note their orientation to each other, their color, thepositions of their fins. and the position of their gill covers, or opercula. Continue your observations for ten minutes,or until one of the fish starts pursuing the other. If this happens, immediately remove the aggressor fish.30. Record what you observe in the space provided below 362371 31. If the fish were equally matched before the experiment, which one theoretically has the advantage? Why? B. Substitute for the removed dominant fish one which was submissive from another group (groups willhave to double-up). Note their orientation to each other, their color, the positions of their fins, and the positionof their gill covers, or opercula. Continue your observations for ten minutes, or until one of the fish starts pursuingthe other. If this happens, immediately remove the submissive (non-attacking) fish.32. Record your observations in the space provided below 33. Did either of the submissive fish show conflict behavior? If so, which one? Why? 363372 C. Placea dominant fish in an aquarium, and allow it five minutes :0 adjust to the new territory. Holda mirror alongside the tank close to the fish, and move it slightly so that the image appears to move. Be patient.Continue for five minutes, or until there is a response, whichever occurs first.23. What kinds of behavior did the fish display toward its mirror image? D. Make two models of the dominant fish using nonwoven interfacing material (or heavy plastic) and scissors.Cut one model out in the shape of the fish when it is in full broadside display (see figure six). Cut one modelout in the shape of the fish at rest (also figure six). Color the models in a fashion similar to your dominantfish. Tie transparent thread or fishing line to the models and wet them.E. Lower one of the models into the water near the fish. If the fish moves away, follow it, but do not touchthe fish. Continue to present the model for five minutes. or until there is a response, whichever occurs first.F. Repeat ,tep E using the other model made during step D.35. Record your observations for steps E and F in the figure seven chart. ReactionBroadside Display Rest No response Swims away Lowers ventral fin Raises dorsal fin Tail expands Color increases Operculae extend Faces model Bites modelFigth.? 7 36. Was the response greater or less than the response to another fish? Why? 364373 Optional ActivitiesStudents may wish to explore some variables concerning fish behavior. They can submit their results tothe instructor in a formal laboratory report.1) Repeat steps D. E. and F. keeping the shape of the objeCt the same but varying the color. Did coloror shape more strongly influence the response of the fish?2) Consider other fish and their behavior For example, schooling is prevalent among many fish. It is aform of social communication. What causes fish to school? Make nonwoven interfacing models similar to thefish in an aquarium. The aquarium may be stocked with groups of schooling fish, such as zebra danios. whiteclouds. or neon tetras. Devise an experiment to determine what types of artificial visual stimuli. such as shapeor color. are required to cause fish to group around and follow the stimulus. Do fish without obv\".)us visualmarkings react similarly to fish with obvious visual markings?Procedure: Hour 4Students need the following supplies: bees in a beehive, compass. magic markers. and an optional bee veil.Additionally, the instructor should have available an adreoalin injection kit. in case of an accidental bee stingto ,vhich some observer may be allergic.In this laboratory hour you will observe a colony of social insects. bees. and their interactions. You alsowill diagram bee dances and observe the relationship of these dances to locating foods sources.Honey BeesHoney bees are social insects with a very high degree of specialization. The female worker bees are sterile.and they leave all egg laying to the queen. The workers exist to benefit the colony as a whole. Working them-selves to death within a few weeks during the height of summer, they tend the queen. brood cells, and thehive. and when older begin to forage away from the hive for pollen and nectar. Food gathering is a communalaffair. and information on its location is exchanged by a successful forager in a variety of elaborate ways.A honey bee colony may number as many as 80.000 individuals, and it consists of a fertile diploid femalecalled the queen. workers which are infertile diploid females constituting more than ninety five percent of thehive's numbers, and drones which are haploid males. The drones do nothing but wait for an opportunity tofertilize a virgin queen during her nuptial flight, thus contributing a colloquial word which describes a non-productive member of human society. This degree of specialization is similar in many other social insects, suchas ants and wasps, in the order Hymenoptera.Queens, Drones, and WorkersBee bodies are divided into three parts. head. thorax and abdomen. The head has compound eyes. Theseeyes are larger in the drone than in the worker or queen. The head also has short. thick. smooth mandibles.which work sideways, instead of up and down as in higher animals. The mandibles have no teeth. but theydo allow hive bees to conduct necessary hive duties such as molding wax into comb. Bees also have a tongueand three pairs of salivary glands. the largest pair of which is used to make food for larvae. The antennae.or feelers. are two long. horn-like structures which protrude from the head of the bee. The feelers appear toserve the purposes of smell. touch. and hearing.The honey bee has four wings and six legs fastened to the thorax. In flight each of the two sections ofwing on either side of the body link together with fine hooks to increase flight surface area In the hive thewings are folded back on each other to expose a minimum of surface area. The legs have claws. and alsoa pocket which secretes a sticky substance. This sticky substance enables bees. like flies. to walk on smoothsurfaces. The anterior legs also have a notch and a thumb-like spine which is used to clean the antennae.The third pair of legs. in worker bees only. has a hollow portion. called a pollen basket. which enables thebees to carry pollen. a protein source. back to the hive. 365374 Breathing organs are in the thorax and in the abdomen between the rings or segments of the third bodysection. The first stomach, or honey sac. is located in the abdomen. The bee can digest honey and nectarby forcing it into a second stomach for digestion. Or. it can regurgitate the contents of the first stomach intohive storage cells where fresh nectar is concentrated through evaporation (aided by hive bees beating theirwings) and altered by enzymes to become honey. In a way. honey can be regarded as a form of bee vomit.Ovaries. or egg pouches. are very large in the queen. and incomplete in worker bees. Drones do not havestingers. Queens have stingers. at the end of the abdomen. which are curved and used as an ovipositer andin fights with other queens Queens can sting many times. Workers. on the other hand, have a straight stingerwhich is barbed and attached to a poison sac. Worker bees use the stinger once. Their sting usually is suicidal.in that the barbed stinger and poison sac are firmly attached to the intestinal tract. Workers with filled stomachs.such as a returning field bee or swarming bees which have filled their honey sacs before leaving the hive. havedistended abdomens and cannot bend to sting until they dump their honey load.Study figure eight which diagrams the three types of honey bee. so that you will be able to identify themin field or hive. Drone Figure 8Worker ReproductionReproduction begins with the mating flight of a Orgin queen. She receives enough sperm during this onemating to last the rest of her egg-laying life. although she may mate with more than one drone. The dronesare killed by the act of coupling Mating takes place when the queen is five to six clays old and occurs on thewing. If mating is delayed beyond two weeks the queen loses the instinct to do so. and she begins laying infertileeggs which will all be haploid drones (desperate worker bees in a queenless hive also begin to lay eggs. butall these too will be drones) The newly fertilized queen will function as an egg-laying machine fur the balanceof her life of perhaps five to seven years. Life spa.i is greatly dependent upon her effectiveness as an egg-layingmachine The workers replace a queen whose output begins to drop Beekeepers also change hive queensevery two to three year, for peak hive efficiency. for a young, healthy queen can lay as many as three thousandeggs a LW; 366375 The queen uses the sperm received during her mating flight to fertilize eggs as she lays them one to acell. Cells are prepared and eggs attended by \"nursery bees.\" The egg develops first into a larva and then intoa pupa. Eggs in cells selected to produce queens are fed a pharyngeal proteinaceous excretion called royaljelly during their entire development. whereas worker bees and drones are fed royal jelly only during the firstthree or four days of development. During the remainder of their time as larvae. workers receive a coarserfood. which is a mixture of pollen and honey called beebread. Groups of young worker bees care for the young.feeding each of them two or three thousand times a day during the six or so days of their larval life stage.Workers cap the cells with wax during pupation. Calculations show that one worker bee working full time cantend only two to three larvae at a time Queens emerge from the pupa in fifteen days. workers in twenty oneclays. and drones in twenty four days.Not all of the queen's eggs are fertilized: those that are not develop as haploid drOnes who are 100% ge-netically related to the queen and to each other. The diploid queen. however. is only 50% related to her sons.because she only donated 50% of her genes to the drones. Workers share the same haploid father, whosesperm is genetically identical. and therefore are 100% related on the father's side. Workers share the samediploid mother. whose eggs have a 50% chance of relatedness. Therefore. workers share a 50% relatednesswith the queen. but a 75% relatedness with each other. Workers have a better chance of reproducing themselvesby protecting the queen than they do by reproducing themselves.Worker Life StagesWhen a worker bee first emerges from the pupa. she busies herself cleaning out newly vacated cells toprepare them for a new generation of larvae. After two or three days. her salivary glands begin to secrete royaljelly and she feeds very young larvae. When larvae are older. she weans then from royal jelly by feeding thembeebread. At the age of seven or eight days the young worker bee will begin short orientation flights from the hiveAfter the tenth day the secretion of royal jelly stops. and the wax glands begin to function. The workerthen becomes a budder of new comb. In addition she receives nectar and pollen brought to the hive. Pollenis stored in cells next to brood cells, while nectar is placed peripherally Many worker bees sit over the nectarcells fanning their wings in order to evaporate the water in nectar and convert it to honey. This is the hummingsound heard inside an active hive. When the evaporation is complete. the workers cap full cells with wax. Atthis age the worker also carries debris and dead bees out of the hive.After two weeks of age. some young worker bees take up guard duty. staying at the entrance of the nestto inspect all incomers. Raiding bees. wasps. beetles, and flies are stung by these guards. but their stingersdo not automatically pull off after stinging brittle skinned insects. so that the guards occasionally live to stingagain. They also fly out to sting large animals, or people. who approach the entrance too closely. Beekeepersknow that light colored polyester clothing is far less likely to antagonize bees than bright or dark colored woolens.(Beekeepers also always wear shoes). Beekeepers avoid using any product with a strong odor, such as perfume.hair spray. or deodorant. when working with bees. \"Smoking\" a hive before entering it apparently disruptschemical signatures, as well as possibly signaling fire and stimulating many bees to consider flight rather thanattack Bees prefer to attack the chemically strongest parts of the body. such as nostrils, mouth, and sweatyhair, hence the use of veils to cover the vulnerable headAfter three weeks of life the wax glands cease to function and the bee becomes a forager. The workermay live as long as a winter. when she is not flying about, to less than five weeks in the summer. when sheliterally works herself to death.CommunicationChemical communication is the primary communication means within the hive. and each hive has its ownchemical signature. Pheromones. chemical hormones which stimulate behavioral responses identify both theindividual and the colony. as well as serve to communicate courses of action. The queen bee coordinates theentire colony by emitting pheromones. The aathor has watched a newly mated queen bee land on the groundfully ten meters from her birth hive, away from the normal flight path. with a drone carcass nearby. stand onher head, and wave her abdomen in the air Within seconds hundreds of worker bees had gathered. Not wishingthe hive to divide by swarming at the height of the nectar season. I killed her, and ever since I have wonderedhow long it would have taken her to attract a support colony 3(37376 1Bees also communicate by elaborate stylized movements and sounds. Some of these movements, or dances,can be seen at the hive entrance. The round dance is performed if food is less than eighty meters from thehive. The odor on the foraging worker indicates the flower in bloom, but the round dance contains no informa-tion about the direction in which to go. (Bees can see ultraviolet colors, which we cannot, but red looks darkor black to them).The waggle dance tells other workers the direction and distance to go for food. The successful forager describesangles between the sun, hive, and food by stylized movements. Toward the sun is indicated by dancing upthe hive body, away from the sun by dancing downward. Straight up means fly toward the sun, and directionleft or right of vertical on the waggle run. Distance to the food source is signaled by the speed of dancing.The farther away it is. the longer the time spent in each waggle run. This waggle dance is a form of symboliccommunication. These two dances, round and waggle, are illustrated in figure nine. Vik WaggleDagnCeCA%%ar 110boteftritr7N\\N.N IRoundDance11 Figure 9 368377Scout Bee StepsA. RevieW the following instructions on bee sting treatment. The odds are that these instructions will nothave to be followed, but it is prudent to be prepared for chance stinging of an allergic individual. Those withknown generalized allergic reactions to bee or wasp stings should not participate in the observations.1)If someone is accidentally stung, remove them from the hive area at once. Bees smell a sting andrepeatedly attack a stung area.2) Scrape the stinger out if it is still embedded in the skin. Do not pull it out, for the poison sac isusually still at the end of it draining its poison into the wound. If you squeeze the poison sac, you will injectall of the remaining poison.3) Observe the sting closely. All insect stings will cause local pain and swelling, and a bee sting canbe particularly uncomfortable. This may be lessened by applying ice. If the individual does not develop a gener-alized allergic reaction within one hour, they most likely will not do so. If they show the following signs of ageneralized allergic reaction, immediately administer an adrenalin injection and take the patient for medicaltreatment.a.Hives.b.Generalized itching.c.Generalized redness.d. Generalized swelling, especially around the face.e.Difficulty breathing, either wheezing, choking, or coughing. f.Dizziness or unconsciousness.B. Slowly approach the entrance to the hive. staying clear of the flight path to and from the hive entrance(watch arriving and departing bees for a few minutes to determine the flight path). Use a bee veil if desiredor available. Do not step on any bees. On a sunny, early afternoon, when large numbers of bees are absenton foraging expeditions, you should be able to approach to within one half meter of the hive entrance. Lookon the ground in front of the hive, and pick up one or two drones (be certain of your identification). Remember,drones do not have stingers. so you can handle them with impunity. Return to a safe distance from the hiveand study the drone.37. Draw the drone bee in the space provided below. Label all the external structures you can identify. 369378 38. Did hive activity change when you removed the drone? Why or why not? C. Return to the hive. find a comfortable position to the side and away from the entrance and flight path.and study the bees on the hive's entrance platform. Note the compass direction which the hive entrance faces(beekeepers usually place them facing the south or southeast, so that early sun stimulates the workers to beginforaging).Remember, move slowly and be patient.39. In the space provided below, diagram any stylized movements you observe on the entrance platform. Diagramthem in relation to the hive body. Label these movements as to direction. i.e. north, south. up. down. etc.Space is provided for up to three different types of movements. D. Follow one of the bee flight paths which seem to originate near a bee round dance. Find out wherethe bees are going. 370379 40. Where are the bees going? 41. What are they gathering? Remember, not only do bees forage for nectar, but also for pollen and water(used for humidifying and cooling the hive). 42. Now far from the hive is their destination'?Optional Activities Students may wish to explore some other variables concerning bee behavior. They can submit their resultsto the instructor in a formal laboratory report.1) Karl von Frisch won the Nobel prize for his historic work on bees in the 1930's. He proved that beescan distinguish colors (hence the assumed symbiotic relationship between the evolution of flower colors andhoney bees). You can duplicate one of his experiments. Set up a small table near the bee hive. Place a pieceof colored construction paper on the table. Use any color except red or black, because bees cannot see thecolor red. Place a petri dish containing a little sugar water on the paper. (Make sugar water by adding twoparts sugar to one part water). Wait until lots of bees are coming to the petri dish. Set up another table nearbywith different colored construction paper on top, and move the sugar water filled petri dish to it. Place an emptypetri dish on top of the original paper and table. Where do the bees go? Now can you vary this experiment?How many different sensing behaviors can you test with this experiment?2) Mark the backs of bees clustered around a waggle or round dance with vegetable dye or paint. (Onemethod is to drop the dye or paint while hanging over the top of the hive). Chart their movements for severalhours. How many bees responded to the particular waggle dancer you observed? Do they also dance in turn?3) Catlogue over a period of weeks the kinds of plants the bees in a particular hive visit. if other hivesare nearby. mark a number of your bees to verify hive identity. What kinds of plants in your locality are pollinatedby honey bees? What plants do the bees prefer? What flavor honey is produced by bees in your area (clover,locust, blackberry. tulip poplar, etc.)?Resources Altmann, Jeanne. Baboon Mother and Infants. Harvard University Press: Cambridge.

LaboratoryHuman Spacing Behavior When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to: 1.Cite examples of human territoriality. 2.List differences in the ways males and females protect theirspace. 3.Consider cultural variations in spacing behavior.4.Observe how the environment impacts spacing behavior. Social HierarchiesDominance hierarchies related to reproductive, feeding. and survival competition are key features of mostsocial groupings. Such hierarchies can be obvious, s.uch as the pecking order in chicken flocks and the alphamale and his mate in wolf packs, or more subtle, such as can be found in flocks of parakeets and in schoolsof fish. Dominant individuals take their pick of limited commodities such as food, shelter, and mates.Dominance hierarchies regularly change due to youthful challenge and aging or disability of once dominantindividuals. Behavioral patterns related to territoriality, such as agonistic displays and nest defense, areimportant in maintaining these hierarchies. Territoriality in Vertebrates:,The extent of permissible physical contact between individuals varies by species. Some animals huddletogether closely, while others do not usually touch. Those species which maintain physical separationcommunicate with the group by sound, smell, visual signals, etc. Close contact animals include hippopotami.parake.1, and many rodents. Minimum contact animals include hawks, horses, and humans. Instinctive formsof tenaoriality include a balance between separation and contact typical of the species. Acceptable distanceis maintained, but there also is a distance at which individuals become anxious about losing contact.Conversely, there is a critical distance beyond which strangers or other animals cannot approach without theindividual wishing to fight or flee. This critical distance varies depending upon whether the animal approach.ingof the same group or species.There are individual variations in spacing behavior within a group. Dominant individuals demand morepersonal space. just as they command first choice of desirable commodities. Ostentatious display by wealthyhumans, such as the building of very large homes, can be interpreted as a form of territorial display bydominant individuals. 375c,3,84 Humans use knowledge of territoriality to manipulate other animals. The narrow, critical distancewhich separates the urge to fight or the urge to flee is used by lion trainers to manipulate the large cats.Upon entering the cage, the trainer will directly approach the lion's critical distance and keep pushingagainst this personal space to force the nervous cat to circle and stalk the intruder. The cat will overcomeany obstacle in its path, such as jump through hoops or onto platforms, in order to stalk the trainer. Thetrainer intrudes into the animal's critical distance, and uses barriers such as a chair so that the animal willnot directly attack, but rather circle. As soon as the lion has circled and stalked in such a way as to performa task desired by the trainer, the lion trainer will step back from the animal's critical area, and the lionwill relax. Through multiple repetitions of challenge to the lion's critical distance, the animal can be manipu-lated to appear trained. Human TerritorialityEdward T. Hall of the University of Chicago studied the spacing behavior of humans, using the termproxemics to describe the ways humans use space within a group. The use of space differs among people ofdifferent cultural backgrounds and in different situations. However. Hall and his associates defined foursituations standard to all cultures and peoples. The four territories are termed intimate space, personal space, social space, and public space. The useof intimate space involves physical contact, blurred vision, smell, soft voices (speaking louder expands the dis-tance). and awareness of body heat. Personal space, from one half to one meter, creates a small protectivearea, or space bubble, between oneself and others. This distance varies from hand-holding distance to arm'slength. and talking is at a low to moderate level. Facial features and details are visible, but body heat is notsensed. Social distance, from one to four meters, is the distance appropriate for social gatherings and imper-sonal business. The entire person is readily seen, voices are moderate, and neither odor nor body heat aresensed. Public distance, from four to eight meters, is the distance for strangers or for formalities, and for voicesat full capacity. Cultural DifferencesThe above distances were derived from United States cultural norms. Problems in human interactionssometimes result from culturally defined differences in acceptable personal space. Since spacing responsesare learned early and become automatic, individuals from different cultures can inadvertently offend. InLatin America. for instance, social distance is often no more than half a meter, similar to personal distancein the U.S. A hypothetical social conversation between a Chicagoan and an individual from Buenos Aireslikely would be marked by the Chicagoan steadily backing away while the Argentine would appear to bestalking the Chicagoan around the room. Neither person is likely to understand why one is discomfitedand the other feels rejected. Middle Easterners and Americans can experience extreme communication problems because of differencesin acceptable spacing behavior. Arabs and Turks recognize a much smaller personal space (although differ-ences do exist between peoples within the region). Same sex hand-holding, bunching together, mutualkissing on the cheeks when arriving and leaving, and speaking practically mouth-to-mouth are standardbehavior. Whereas Americans avoid breathing on others while speaking, Arabs require it for sincerity ofcommunication. The American who turns his head away while speaking. or who declines the opportunity tosit close to a stranger, can quite innocently offend. 376385 Human spacing behavior has tremendous impact, ranging from definitions of correct public behay.Dr tothe buildings we erect. American farmers, for example, scatter across the countryside in individual farmsteads,whereas Turkish peasants cluster together in villages and commute to their fields. One insists on privacy, theother needs human closeness. The purpose of this laboratory is to determine the patterns of human spacing behavior in your school. Pre-Lab Supplies needed: pencil Special Preparationstape measure Students should plan to observe other students eating lunch. in a cafeteria or similar area, for three con-secutive days. The observing students will require an alternate lunch period. Consequently, the only prepara-tion required for this laboratory is scheduling. Time RequiredThe human spacing behavior laboratory requires three classroom hours, in addition to prepa-rations, discussion, and review. These classroom hours must coincide with the school lunchperiod. Procedure: Hour 1 Students need all listed supplies. During this laboratory hour the student will observe students while eating lunch and interacting during thelunch. period. Steps A. Before lunch begins find a comfortable. unobtrusive seat, preferably with your back to the wall. Assurethat one or two lunch tables are close and clearly visible. Since you can adequately observe no more thaneight people interacting, one table seating six or more people will be sufficient.

PurposeThe purpose of this laboratory is to introduce the student to the study of plant growth. Live plantlaboratories such as this require time for plants to respond to conditions Placed upon them, and timing is animportant aspect of such studies. This laboratory actually is a cluster of seven mini-experiments begun andconcluded over a timed and separated set of laboratory sessions.Locus of Plant GrowthPlant growth is influenced by many factors. Before observing how environmental changes influence plantgrowth, it is essential to know what parts of a plant grow, and how fast they grow in relation to other parts.The first experiment, begun in hour one of this laboratory and concluded in hour five, pinpoints the locusof plant growth in stems, leaves, and roots.PhototropismThe second experiment in this laboratory, begun in hour one and concluded in hour six, repeatsCharles Darwin's classic experiment on phototropism. Darwin, attempting to identify the most physio-logicMly active site in a plant, studied the effects of gravity and unidirectional light on plant movement.He concluded, in The Power of Movements in Plants, that \"when seedlings are freely exposed to a laterallight some influence is transmitted from the u_ pper to the lower part causing the latter to bend.\" Todaywe know that this \"influence\" is exerted by plant hormones called auxins. They stimulate cell elonga-tion and RNA transcription within the cell which are then followed by an increase in the biosynthesisof proteins. 403413 Light, Gibberellin, and GrowthThe third experiment, begun in hour one, continued in hours seven and eight, and concluded in hournine, studies how light rays of specific frequency affect plant growth. It also demonstrates how gibberellin, aplant-growth regulator, influences plant growth. More than fifty gibberellins have been identified, and charac-teristically they stimulate cell elongation, tissue differentiation, and bolting.Control of Cell ElongationThe fourth experiment, begun in hour two and concluded in hour three, studies some chemical regulatorsinvolved in plant cell elongation. Coleoptiles, leaf growth tips, will be excised and paced in various test tubes.Separating these parts from the rest of the plant avoids endogenous auxins or other regulatory chemicals. Anauxin, IAA (indole acetic acid), will be applied in varying amounts to different test tubes, along with othersynthetic auxins and auxin inhibitors. It is not yet fully known how auxins regulate cell elongation, but factorssuch as increased cell permeability to water, reduction in cell wall pressure, and an increase in wall synthesishave been observed. Students will graph some factors influencing growth versus IAA concentration.Seed GerminationSeed germination varies considerably in response to light. Some seeds require light to germinate, light in-hibits germination in other seeds, and, in still others, germination is associated with a photo-periodic response.Temperature also may interact with light to influence the germination of some seeds.In the fifth experiment, begun in hour four and concluded in hour six, lettuce seeds will be germinatedin response to specific wavelengths of light. Because imbibition of water modifies the light germinating responseof lettuce seeds, this factor was standardized before the start of the experiment.Additionally, three plant hormones and their effects on lettuce seed germination are tested. An auxin, IAA, .which stimulates plant cell elongation and growth, a plant growth hormone, GA (gibberellin). which also stimulatescell elongation, and a cytokinen, kinetin, which stimulates cell division, are all used to test lettuce seed germination.Control of Bud DormancyIn the sixth experiment, begun in hour one, continued in hour eight, and concluded in hour nine, thestudent will consider the effects of two plant hormones on bud development. This is an elegantly simpleexperiment in which the action of a plant auxin, IAA, and a plant growth regulator, GA, are considered bothseparately and jointly.Flowering inPharbitus nilIn the seventh experiment, begun in hour seven and concluded in hour ten, the effect of day/night lengthon the stimulation of flowering in morning glories, Pharbitus nil, is studied by varying the amount of light theyreceive. Different plants flower variously in response to the amount of light they receive. They may be short-day or long-day plants. Some plants flower in response to the amount of dark they receive, such as morningglories. They may beport -night or long-night plants. Some plants are not affected by the amounts of lightor dark they receive. They are called day-neutral plants.In the second part of this seventh experiment, the role of florigen, a plant flowering regulator, is studiedindirectly. it is believed that florigen is produced in plant leaves and travels to the nodes to stimulate flowering.It was described and named by M. Kh. Chailakhyan, a Russian scientist during the 1930's. Since it hasnot yet been successfully isolated, some scienti..,,s question the existence of such a chemical. However, itapparently is influenced by several other plant hormones. such as IAA and by phytochromes, pigmentswhich respond to light intensity and periodicity, and especially by the level of GA. Since GA production isinfluenced by day/night length, florigen production also is influenced by day/night length. In addition, florigenproduction seems to be stimulated variously by different light wavelengths. The issue of florigen is an excellentarea for further research. 404414 Pre-LabSupplies needed: greenhouse3 cabinets, closets, ml. test tubesAccess cabinetcontrolled solution10' cyanide1 IAA in ethanol1% IAA lanolinlanolinaluminum foil Living Materials1 pot with 4-6 bean seedlings40 soaked corn seeds60 corn seedlings48 Alaska pea seeds24 soaked Alaska pea seeds24 soaked dwarf pea seeds3 germinating pea seedlings450 soaked (16 hours in the dark)lettuce seeds10 day old potted Pharbitus nil(morning glory) seedlings Special Preparations1) Because of the deferred observation times in this laboratory, care must be taken when scheduling thefirst hour. Allow seven days between the seventh and eighth hours of this laboratory, and five days betweenthe eighth and ninth hours of this laboratory. The tenth hour cannot be concluded until at least twenty-eightdays after the beginning of this laboratory, or three weeks after the seventh hour, whichever is e.sier toschedule. In other words, the entire laboratory will be spaced over a one month period, but the initial sevenhours may be completed in seven consecutive laboratory sessions.2) Students must have access to a greenhouse to conduct this laboratory. Also, it is difficult for theinstructor to have necessary living plants ready for use, if a greenhouse is not available. There are manymodels of inexpensive glass or plastic sheeting greenhouses available for those schools lacking a standardgreen house. 405415 3) Controlled environment chambers are available from many biological supply houses. The controlledenvironment chamber should have a timer for light control. If one did not come with the school's environmentchamber, they are relatively easy to purchase and install separately. For this laboratory, tha controlled environment chamber must be placed in a room or closet in which the only light received by the plants wit! he fromthe chamber itself.4) Vial cabinets are available from many biological supply houses. Obtain a vial cabinet of sufficient sizefor the entire class. Each student group will need to place one tray with 40 vials in the cabinet. Of currentlyavailable vial trays, the closest in size holds up to 45 vials.5) Of the three cabinets, closets, or small darkrooms, one should have no lighting, one should have dimred lighting, and the third should have fluorescent lighting. The entrance to each should be hung with blackoutcloth to keen out extraneous light when people enter or leave. If space is a problem, the threeenclosures may consist of light protected shelving in the classroom proper. However, this experiment is muchmore reliable if students are able to enter the areas and remain inside to manipulate the plants. Blackout clothis essential because very small amounts of extraneous light may be enough to invalidate results. Dim redlighting may be installed either by using red bug lights, or by using grow lights over which red cellophane hasbeen taped at sufficient distance so as not to melt. Plant stands within the enclosures may either be built-inor borrowed mobile plant stands from classrooms.6) Plant grid markers in the form of rubber stamps are available from many biological supply houses.Plant materials such as leaves may be backed by a damp sponge while being stamped with a plant grid markercoated with fingerprint ink. Fingerprint ink is readily available. 7)It is convenient to purchase plant auxins as a kit. Plant regulator kits containing seventeen auxins in100 mg: amounts are available from chemical supply houses. Those auxins not used in this laboratory willbe used in either laboratory twenty-nine or thirty. Or, you may prefer to purchase each auxin or regulatorseparately.8) Cycloheximide.if purchased alsois known as maleic acid hydrazide and, if purchased separately, is solo as 1,2-dihydro-3,6-pyridazinedione.9) Have the chemicals required for hour two available it stock erienmeyer flasks.. with a 5 ml. pipet ineach flask.10) To add auxins to lanolin, heat the lanolin only enough to melt it, and star in the auxin. 0.1% IAA(indoleacetic acid) in lanolin may be prepared by dissolving 100 mg. IAA in 2 ml. absolute ethyl alcoholand stirring this solution into 100 g. lanol'n paste. 1.0% IAA in lanolin may be prepared in the same fashion,in this case dissolving 1 g. IAA. GA (gibberellic acid, also called gibberollin from the fungus from which it wasfirst isol-.ted) in lanolin is prepared in a similar manner. This makes enough IAA and GA in lanolin for de, ssesfor several years. Also, growth regulator paste kits, which contain all the above auxins in le Bolin, are availablein many bk.iogical supply catalogues and can be purchased \"ready made.\"11) Those seeds which need to be soaked before using, except for the lettuce seeds, are to be placed inwater twelve to twenty-four hours prior to the laboratory session. Plant bean seeds in rcts three weeksbefore the laboratory session. Plant corn seedlings two weeks befcre the laboratory session, and st- peaseedlings ten days prior to the laboratory session.12) The morning glories are used in a group laboratory on stimulation of flowering. Students will monitorthe experiment, but the experiment itself will be done by the class as 3 whole. The instructor will need to start13 pots of morning glories for each class ten days before the laboratory session under long-day conditionsin an environment chamber (16 hours light and 8 hours dark, repeating). After eight days. and two days beforethe hour seven procedure, change the lighting conditions to continuous, 24-hour light. 406416 13) Fourteen students will be scheduled for brief laboratory worn( during off -hours in connection withthe morning glory flowering experiment. All students will be required to return to the laboratory twoto four hours after hour six in order to observe the results of the phototropism experiment.14) And type of garden pot may be used in these experiments. Clay or plastic pots are Convenient forlarger plants and those plants which will grow in a pot for more than three weeks. Peat pots convenientfor starting plants and sprouting seeds.Time Required:The plant growth laboratory requires ten &Ask:room hours, in addition to preparations, discussion, andreview. The laboratory sessions take place over a period of one month, even though most of thelaboratory sessions are schedule. during the fist seven classroom hours. During the month-long periodplants must be watered and tended.Procedure: Hour I.Students need the following: pot with bean seedlings, plant grid marker, fingerprint ink, sponge,600 ml. beaker, glass plate, paper toweling, distilled water, 3 germinating pea seedlings. rubber band.aluminum foil, 40 shell vials, vial tray, vermiculite, 40 soaked corn seeds, 10 pets, 8 soaked Alaska pea seeds,8 soaked dwarf pea seeds, and 48 Alaska pea seeds.Additionally, students need access to all structures listed under \"Access To\" in the pre-laboratory instructions.During this laboratory hour students will set up experiments on stem and leaf growth, root growth.phototropism, light and gibberellin, and control of bud dormancy.StepsA.Stem and leaf growth:an experiment on the 'ocus of plant growth. Obtain a pot which containsfour to six bean seedlings grown in the light. Label the pot with your name and today's date. Examine theseedlings carefully and note the number of visible leaves and nodes. Coat a plant grid marker with fingerprintink, and moisten a sponge. Select two of the seedlings and mark them with the grid marker from the groundto the apex. Use the moistened sponge to support the seedlings during this operation. Depending on the plantgrid marker available to you, your lines will be either 1 o 2 irm. apart. Select two other seedlings and applythe grid marker to the smallest visible leaf (as long as it is greater than 5 mm. long) on each plant. Returnthe plants to the greenhouse for five days.The above experit.tent may also be done using India ink and a fine pen with rule!. In that case allow anentire hour for the step A procedure.B.Root growth:an experiment on the locus of plant growth. Prey are a moist chamber by lining the sidesof a 600 ml. beaker with thoroughly moistened paper toweling. Completely cover an 3 x 10 cm. glass platewith filter paper soaked with distilled water. Label the beaker with your name and today's date.Select a healthy, straight, germinating pea seedling and wipe off excess moisture. Mark the root, startingat the tip and continuing for one centimeter, with the plant grid marker and fingerprint ink, again using a moistsponge for support. Do this for three roots. Mark three more roots with a single mark one centimeter from the tip.Attach the seedlings to the glass plate by slipping them through a rubber band attached to the glass plate.Cover the beaker with aluminum foil and place it in your locker or drawer for five days.C.Phototropism:a classic experiment first performed by Charbts Darwin. Fill 40 shell vials with wetvermiculite, and plant in each a single. soaked corn seed. radicle down. Place the vials in the vial tray, andlabel the tray with your name and today's date. Store this in the vial cabinet for six days. 40741 D.Light, Gibberellin, and Growth: an experiment testing the result of adding the growth regulatorgibberellin to plants. (Phosfon, a chemical with an impact opposite to that of gibberellin, is used by thehorticultural trade to make plant growth more compact on ornamental plants.)Fill six pots with wet vermiculite. To three pots add 8 soaked Alaska pea seeds, and to the other threepots add 8 soaked dwarf pea seeds. Label each pot with your name and date. and seed type. Place one pairin the enclosure with fluorescent light, one pair in dim red light, and the third pair in the dark enclosure. Makesure the pots stay moist. but otherwise leave them for eight days.E.Control of Bud Dormancy:an experiment to determine bud dormancy control. Fill four pots with gnodpotting soil or vermiculite and plant them with 12 Alaska pea seeds each. Water them and make sure eleystay mo'st, but otherwise leave them in the greenhouse for fifteen days.Procedure: Hour 2Students need the following: 0.025 M. maleate. 10% sucrose water solution.

You also will determine the effects of three plant hormones, an auxin (IAA). a growth regulator (GA),and a cytokinen (kinetin) on seed germination.StepsA. Place filter paper in the bottom of 9 petri dishes. Label dishes #1 through #9, and put your name andtoday's date on each of them. To the dishes add:dishes #1 - 5. add 3 ml. distilled water:dish #6, add 3 ml. 1 ppm ml. 1 add 0.1 ppm kinetin. 411421 B. Attach green cellophane to a flashlight with a rubber band, so that light from the flashlight shines throughthe green cellophane. You will use the shielded flashlight to work in the dark. The following steps must other-wise be conducted in the dark. When moving petri dishes and lettuce seeds from one light source to another,as detailed below, cover the entire petri dish with aluminum foil to protect the dish from extraneous light whichmight invalidate your experimental results.1). Working with the green cellophane filtered flashlight, place in each of the nine dishes 50 lettuceseeds that have been soaked for 16 hours in the dark.2). Place dishes \"1, 6, 7 & 8 immediately in the dark.3). Expose dishes \"2, 3, 4, 5 & 9 to three minutes of red light. Place #2 & 9 in the dark.4).

LaboratoryPlant and Water Relationships When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Determine by a graded solution method the water potentialof potato tissue.2.Determine the rate of water conduction/transport per hourin a herbaceous plant.3.Determine the water holding capacity of four soil types.4.Determine the effect of temperature on the rate and totalimbibition of water by kelp.5.Determine the effect of soil water percentage on seedgermination.6.Determine the path of water transport in a woody plant. PurposeAll living organisms require water. Indeed, they are composed mostly of water, and maintenance of internalwater levels is essential to life. To properly study living plants, water relationships must be fully known. Thislaboratory introduces the student to several aspects of plant/water relationships through studies to be madein six mini-experiments.Water Potential DeterminationUnder natural conditions, practically all water absorption by rooted plants takes place through the roothairs. Water diffuses into the root hairs, and other epidermal cells, as a result of a diffusion pressure deficitgradient. As long as the diffusion pressure deficit of the root cells' sap is greater than that of the soil solution,water will enter the cell. Any increase in the concentration of minerals or decrease in turgor pressure will increasethe diffusion pressure deficit of the cell sap, thereby increasing the uptake of soil water. We therefore cansay that most water absorption occurs through passive osmotic mechanisms.The student will determine the water potential of potato tissue during the first experiment of this laboratory.Water potential of tissue is dependent upon the amount of solute concentrated in water surrounding the tissue.Solute concentration is comparable to osmotic pressure. When graphed, the student will be able to find anequilibrium where water is neither gained nor lost and to determine the corresponding osmotic pressure valuewhich indicates the water holding potential of the tissue.Soil Water Percentage and Seed GerminationDuring the second experiment the amount of soil water required to effectively trigger corn seed germinationis measured. As noted in laboratory twenty-eight, there are many factors which might trigger or otherwiseinfluence seed germination, not the least of which is seed type. Light requirements, temperature requirements,mechanical resistance of the seed coat, seed coat permeability properties, and hormonal controls are someof these factors. This experiment gives the student the ability to specifically test one mechanical germinationfactor, soil water requirements. 4334 5 Imbibition and TemperatureThe effects of temperature upon imbibition rate and total absorption are studied during the third experiment.This experiment is a graphic reminder that all of the plant/water experiments in this laboratory would yielddifferent values if performed at temperatures other than room temperature.Water Holding CapacityDifferent soils have different water holding capacities. The water holding capacity of soils depends on manyfactors, such as the physical size and structure of soil particles. Other factors include the diffusion pressure ofwater in the soil. The more solutes in the water, the lower the diffusion pressure. Diffusion pressure can beincreased or decreased by atmospheric pressure. Weather conditions and altitude thus are factors which alsoaffect the water holding capacity of soil.When a soil type holds the maximum amount of water it can without being waterlogged, it is consideredto be at field capacity. When a soil is holding so little water that a plant can no longer extract enough waterthrough its root hairs to maintz..n life, the soil is considered to have reached its permanent wilting percentage,or wilting coefficient. A plant reaches a state of permanent wilt when it can no longer regain turgor when watered.The term \"permanent wilting percentage\" is a rather unfortunate choice of words because the term refersto water held by a soil type under specific conditions, and yet it defines that soil condition by reference to -'antgrowth. The permanent wilting percentage of soil does vary according to the type of plant growing on it, althoughthese species dependent variations account for only about ten percent of the permanent wilting percentageof any given soil.The fourth experiment tests the water holding capacities of four soil types. An experiment to test the permanentwilting percentage of soil is introduced as an optional activity at the end of this laboratory.Water Movement Through a StemThe timed movement of water through an herbaceous stem is studied during the fifth experiment. Theactual path of water movement in a woody stem is studied during the sixth experiment. An experiment todemonstrate transpirational pull. or how water can be carried to the tops of the tallest trees by simple osmoticmechanisms, is given as an optional activity at the end of this laboratory.Pre-labSupplies needed: Equipment10 125 ml. wide erlenmeyer flasks 1 cm. diameter cork borer10 stoppers to fit flasks knifetray for 10 flasks hold 4 0300 tin cansdrying oven photoflood light500 ml. graduated cylinder screen to hold tin cans5 ml. graduated cylinder2 1-holed rubber stoppers to fit 1000 ml. flasks4 0300 tin cans with bottoms perforated (14 ozs., g. dry kelp (kombu)4 soil types2 uniform branches of an evergreen, such as hemlock or cedar1 stem Impatiens (garden balsam) or celery stalkfilter paper7 cm. ml. eosin solutionplastic distilled water40 2-hour soaked corn seeds Special Preparations1) To assure that there are enough tin cans for the entire class, start collection well before the actual laboratory.2) 1M sucrose is made by dissolving 342 g. sucrose in distilled water, and adding more distilled waterto make 1 liter.

The exact temperatures canvary slightly from those listed for the experiment. The lowest temperature can be achieved by setting the culturedishes and distilled water in a refrigerator, the second simply by leaving the culture dishes and water at roomtemperature, and the third by placing them in an incubator.7) Test soil types from your locality and select four with meaningful differences in water holding capaCity.Time RequiredThe plant and water relationships laboratory requires six full classroom hours and one partial additionalhour, in addition to preparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the following: 500 ml. 1M sucrose solution, graduated cylinders. 10 125 ml. wideerlenmeyer flasks with stoppers, 1 cm. diameter cork borer, 1 large potato, filter paper, scale or balance, tray,refrigerator. 4 #300 tin cans with the bottoms perforated, 4 sheets 7 cm. diameter filter paper, 4 soil types,4 petri dishes, pan, and water.In this laboratory you will set up both an experiment to determine the water holding potential of potatotissue, as well as an experiment to test the water holding capacity of four soil types.StepsA.

Compare water loss through each of the branches. Which tracheid system absorbs water and which systemloses water? How can you tell from this information the paths of water movement in plants? Optional ActivitiesStudents may wish to explore other aspects of plant and water relationships. Listed below are two experi-ments, one on permanent wilting percentage and the other on plant transpiration. Students can submit theirresults to the instructor in a formal laboratory report.1) Permanent Wilting Percentage: six to eight weeks prior to this laboratory, four tomato seedlings shouldbe planted in each of four pots with good garden soil, and with a 5-6 cm. glass cylinder fitted around themain stem of each seedling.When you are ready to begin the experiment, seal the lower end of the cylinder with soft wax, and fillthe cylinder to within one centimeter of the top with the soil you wish to test. This soil should be a type whichhas already had its water holding capacity determined, as during this laboratory. Moisten by adding water dropby drop. Do not waterlog. Return the plants to the greenhouse. Water the main plants normally, but do notwater the dirt in the cylinder.After six weeks remove the soil from the cylinder. separating out the roots which have grown into it fromthe stem. An easy way to do this is to slice off the entire tomato stem both above and below the cylinder.remove the stem section and roots carefully so as to minimize soil loss, and then empty the soil from the cylinder.Weigh the soil without delay, place it in a drying oven for two days, and weigh again. Your data may be easilyread from a chart such as the following, figure eleven. Soil type and its water holding capacity have been previouslydetermined. Tare weight is what you measure after six weeks of drought. Although the soil still holds somewater, the plant is no longer able to withdraw that residue. The soil at that point has reached its permanentwilting Pull: fill a small bore capillary tube which is 100 cm. or more in length with recentlyboiled, distilled water. Attach a woody shoot of Chamaecyparis or Thuja to one end of the capillary tube witha length of heavy rubber tubing. and place the other end of the glass tube into a test tube of water. Greatcare must be taken to avoid introducing air bubbles into the system.Pour a small amount of clean mercury into the test tube, so that mercury covers the end of the capillarytube. Observe this set up periodically, and record the maximum height reached by the mercury. If more than76 cm. was recorded, how would you interpret such a result?Instead of using a woody evergreen twig. you can perform the same experiment by demonstrating trans-pirational pull using a porus clay cup in place of the twig.ResourcesCarlquist, Sherwin. \"Types of Cambial Activity and Wood lop-Harrison, Yolande. \"Carnivorous Plants.\" Scientific American, February 1978.Triplett.

LaboratoryMineral Absorption, Use, and Trans location in Plants When you have completed this laboratory you should be able to:1.Determine the minimum mineral requirements of a plant.2.Determine the absorption of iron by barley roots.3.Determine the effects of temperature and a competing ionon mineral absorption rate.4.Trace the translocaticin of Fe\" in a plant. PurposeMinerals are absorbed by plants during the imbibition and transpiration of water. Minerals. mostly in theform of salts. accumulate in the xylem ducts of the root and translocate to the shoot. Once in the shoot, theyare distributed and redistributed throughout the entire plant. The plant uses different minerals in different ways.It is able to move minerals to areas of greater need or to save minerals prior to leaf drop by moving theminerals to other areas of the plant. Some minerals are highly mobile while others are not. Different plantspecies have different mineral requirements. or utilize similar amounts of the same minerals in different ways.Essential Mineral ElementsMacro-nutrientsCarbon. hydrogen. and oxygen are the three elements present in all carbohydrates, fats. proteins, andother organic components of living organisms. Plants obtain them from atmospheric carbon dioxide and fromwater.Nitrogen is absorbed by plants as nitrate or ammonium ions derived from the decomposition of organicmatter in the soil, and by other means. Nitrogen functions as a primary constituent of proteins, as well asof other plant parts such as chlorophyll.All remaining plant nutrients are obtained from soil minerals.For example. phosphorus, obtained from the soil, functions as a constituent of some fatty substances andof special proteins found in cell nuclei and chromosomes. It also is a component of starch synthesizing systemsin many plants and a component of the adenylic acid system which stores chemical energy in cells for later release.Sulfur serves as a constituent of many proteins, including certain enzymes.Calcium is present in calcium pectate, which is the principal component of the middle lamella of leavesand generally maintains the differential permeability of cellular membranes. It also promotes the activity ofcertain enzymes, such as amylase.Magnesium is a basic constituent of chlorophyll. and some magnesium also promotes thq activity of certainenzymes, especially those which function in carbohydrate transformations. 453463 Potassium functions in the synthesis of proteins and in the translocation of carbohydrates.Iron functions in the synthesis of chlorophyll and as a constituent of several important oxidative enzymes.Iron actually might better be called a micro-nutrient, because it is required by the plant in amounts similar tothat of micro-nutrients.Micro-nutrientsBoron functions in the synthesis of proteins and pectins in the plant.Manganese is required in the synthesis of chlorophyll and also in the synthesis and digestion of fats and oils.Zinc functions in the synthesis of the auxin IAA, indole acetic acid, and it also is a constituent of the en-zyme carbonic anhydrase.Copper is a constituent of enzymes (the polyphenol oxidases) which cause the browning reaction on cutsurfaces of fruits and vegetables. Incidentally, you exploited the browning reaction in laboratory seven onenzyme activity, when you measured light transmittance and absorbance with the spectrophotometer. (Researchersdo not yet know of other uses of capper in plants.)Molybdenum is active in transformations of nitrogen, as in nitrogen fixation by bacteria and nitrate reduc-tion by higher plants.Chlorine is considered to be a micro-nutrient, but its function is as yet unknown. Its presence in plantswas discovered only in 1960.Additionally, some plants require yet other elements in trace amounts. For example. diatoms require sili-con. some algae require vanadium, and galium is required by some fungi. Sodium stimulates the growth ofsome plants. such as sugar beets, and most desert plants. There is evidence that nickel, cobalt, aluminumand titanium also are required by some plants; but why, how, and in what amounts has yet to be determined.Radioactive TracersUntil the development of radioactive tracing techniques plant physiologists encountered great difficultiesdetermining which vascular tissues provide passage for mineral salts from one area of the plant to another.Since the introduction of radioactive tracers, several ditferent pathways for the translocation of salts have beendiscovered. For example, mineral salts move in the xylem, in the phloem, laterally between these two tissues,and outward from the leaf.Mineral Absorption, Utilization, and Trans locationThis laboratory is designed as three introductory mini-experiments in the determination of minimum mineralrequirements of a plant. the monitoring of plant mineral uptake, and the tracing of the translocation of a miner-al throughout a plant.Mineral Deficiency CultureThe first experiment is designed to explore the mineral nutritional requirements of the mold, Aspergillusniger. The mold will be grown both in complete nutrient solution and in solutions deficient in differentelements. As an optional activity at the end of this laboratory, directions are given for the growth of tomatoseedlings without soil, some in complete nutrient baths, and others with deficient nutrient baths.Mineral AbsorptionThe second experiment involves testing barley roots for mineral uptake over a period of time and deter-mining how temperature affects that uptake. Mineral absorption also is tested to determine how the presence 454464 of a competing ion affects uptake. Uptake is traced and monitored by adding a radioactive tracer and countingthe absorbed radioactive substances on a scintillation well counter.Iron Trans locationThe third experiment involves tracing the circulation and reutilization of a mineral once it has beenabsorbed into the plant. Different minerals are utilized in different ways. This experiment traces the path ofiron in a plant by using a radioactive tracer. Fe\". The plant is blotted and then placed against film which isallowed to develop for two to three days in a darkroom. In essence, the plant photographs itself with absorbedradioactivity. The result is called an autoradiograph.Radioactive Tracing in 'Studies of Trans locationMinerals generally are taken up in the transpiration stream and exported to the leaves, with excess quanti-ties of minerals relocated downward in the phloem. Minerals can be transported laterally into xylem tissue wherethey can again be translocated upwards to repeat the cycle until completely used by the plant. Elements suchas nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus move readily within this circuit, recycling many times. Because phos-phorus is highly mobile and also available as a radioactive isotope. there are many experiments in which anautoradiograph of radioactive phosphorus in plants can be taken.Radioactive calcium is taken up in a fashion similar to phosphorus. nitrogen, and potassium. However,calcium is immobile in the phloem. and once delivered by the transpiration stream, it remains stationary inthe phloem until utilized.Radioactive sulfur also is mobile in plants, but because of its rapid uptake into metabolic compounds. itdoes not circulate in the plant like phosphorus. nitrogen. and potassium. When sulfur is translocated, it rapidlybecomes concentrated in the plant's younger leaves. Mature leaves lose their suifur content to younger, fastergrowing leaves. All this occurs within twenty-four hours of uptake. Sulfur is a constituent of proteins, and pro-tein synthesis occurs to a much greater extent in young leaves. Therefore, sulfur circulating within a plant iscaptured metabolically by sites of protein synthesis within the plant. In this fashion sulfur rapidly is renderedimmobile in plants.Radioactive iron tracing within the tissues of a plant yields information on the uptake and subsequent mo-bility of iron. Iron mobility is dependent primarily upon iron concentration in plant tissues, but it is dependentsecondarily upon phosphorus availability and on pH. When iron concentration is low in plant tissue, uptakeand translocation of iron into the phloem is highest. As iron increases in the tissues, the mobility of iron decreases.A pH of four gives high iron mobility. This mobility decreases as the pH increases to seven. Low phosphorusavailability increases iron mobility. As phosphorus concentrations increase, iron mobility decreases.Radioactive iron is used in the third experiment employing autoradiography, because iron is readily takenup and moved abc at within plants. The many variations possible in iron uptake make it possible to experimentfurther with the absorption, utilization, and translocation factors influencing Fe\" uptake. Students are urgedto continue these experiments on their own.Pre-labSupplies needed: 16 culture jars with capsscale or balancescintillation well counter5500 C. furnaceincubatorplant pressEquipmentglass stirring watchglassesdessicator or pressurecooker and fixative100 solution which contains 2.5 mg. Fe/liter plus 10 gFe\" per literPlantsAspergillus barley rootsSpecial Preparations1) Stock solutions of the minerals required for Aspergillus niger nutrition should be made available in stockbottles with 10 ml. pipets. Prepare by adding each of the following to a liter stock flask and then adding distilledwater to make one liter of solution:12.5 g. Na2SO412.5 g. g. NaNO,100 g. cane sugar2) To make the Fe59 stock solution, add 0.14 g. CaSO, to .1 liter of distilled water and then add 2.5 mg.Fe and 10\u00b5g. Fe59. Allow 500 ml. Fe59 stock solution per student group.3) Fe\" is easily obtained in license exempt quantities of 5 ml. with low concentrations of acid or carrier.By law you can order no more than ten vials during any one time period. This radioactive source is suitablefor most tracer studies, even though it is not recommended for very precise research use. The half life of Fe59is only forty-five and one-half days: thus. you must 3ecify the usage date when ordering. See appendix Bfor a supplier. Such suppliers also usually sell x-ray film and processing chemicals used in autoradiographicexperiments.4) X-ray film processing chemicals usually are sold as developing fluids A and B and fixative. There aremany kits available which contain both the X-ray film and processing chemicals. Directions are printed on thepackage. If you wish to purchase materials separately, hydroquinone (trade name Quinol) is a good de-veloping agent. Rhodol, 1-4 dihydroxyben-zene, and Metol is thiosulfate. is what is normallysold as a fixative. It is much easier to purchase these as kits 'and to follow package directions.5) Most schools have a darkroom set up for journalism and yearbook photographic activities. It usuallyis easy to arrange for time in the darkroom for science use. A darkroom usually will have many pieces of equipmentand materials required for autoradiography, in which case you will not have to worry about a clothesline.clothespins, a water source, developing pans, etc. 456466 6) X-ray film is widely available from many sources, including biological supply houses.7) School art or industrial arts rooms may have a furnace with a 550\u00b0 C. capability. If this is not availableat the high school, search your locality for colleges with such a furnace, or amateur potters with kilns. 8)If your school does not have a scintillation well counter. one probably will be available at local institu-tions of higher learning or research oriented private companies.9) Plant presses are available from most biological supply houses, or you can make your own.10) Aspergillus niger: grow one slant of this bread mold for every two laboratory groups. Inoculate nutri-ent agar slants with mold one week before the start of the experiment. Incubate. See laboratories fourteenand seventeen for directions on preparing slants and on identifying Aspergillus niger.11) Barley roots: germinate barley seeds on a mesh screen over a container filled with tap water. Runwater into the container very slowly to maintain freshness. The roots will grow through the screen into thewater so that they can be easily snipped off below the screen at the beginning of the experiment. Start ger-minating the barley seeds ten days before start of the experiment. By using only tap water for germination,the roots will have a low salt content, which promotes the conditions for good iron uptake.If you were to germinate the barley roots on a screen over a complete nutrient solution (see optional activity in this laboratory for information on complete nutrient requirements), you would have produced high saltbarley Toots.12) Bean plants must be started five weeks before the start of the experiment on mineral translocation.Germinate bean seeds on filter paper soaked in a complete'nutrient solution (see the optional activity in thislaboratory).When the beans have germinated, grow them without soil for four more weeks. See the optional activityin this laboratory for the nutrients required for complete soilless growth. You may purchase the complete solu-tion in most biological supply catalogues, or you may make your own following the directions given in thislaboratory. If you make your own solution, omit the iron containing chemical and add Fe\" instead. Either way,add 1 ml. Fe\" per liter of nutrient solution. Grow two bean seedlings for each student group.After the bean seedlings have grown for two weeks in the complete nutrient solution containing Fe\", re-move half the bean seedlings from the solution and grow them in complete nutrient solution without Fe\".In this fashion you will have one bean seedling for each student group grown for two weeks in a radioactivesolution, and one bean seedling grown for four weeks in a radioactive solution.Time Required:The mineral absorption, use, and translocation in plants laboratory requires seven full classroom hours,as well as one partial hour, in addition to preparations, discussion, and review.Procedure: Hour 1Students need the fclowing: 16 sterlizable storage jars with caps. and marking pen and pencil.During this laboratory hour you will prepare eight mineral nutrient solutions.

Take all twelve labeled evaporating dishes filled with dried barley root residue and ash them to grey-white in a 550\" C. furnace for twenty to thirty minutes. Allow the ash to cool for twenty-four hours.C. Mineral Trans location: put on the same plant press sheet a plant grown for 4 weeks in a nutrientsolution with Fe\", and a plant grown for 2 weeks in the same solution and then for 2 weeks in a normal com-plete nutrient solution. Label appropriately. Place a plant press blotter top and bottom and cover the packagewith plastic wrap. Take the package to a darkroom. Next. in complete darkness. place a sheet of x-ray filmbehind one of the blotters. Wrap the whole package. plants. sheet. blotters, plastic wrap. and x-ray film, inaluminum foil and black paper and insert the whole package in the plant press. Store in a cool. dark placefor two or three days.Procedure: Hour 6Students need the following: twelve evaporating dishes with barley root ash. 3N HCI. warming oven.13 15x140 mm. counting tubes with screw caps. pipet. pans. paper toweling. and a scintillating well counter.During this laboratory hour you will determine the radioactivity of the treated barley roots. This must beaccomplished entirely in one hour. or else all counts must be corrected to compensate for further radioactivedecay. Remember, the half life of Fe\" is forty-five and a half days.StepsA. Using three successive 1 :rd. portions of warm (about 50- 60\" C.) 3N HCl to dissolve the ash. transferby wetting the ash in each of the twelve evaporating dishes. or the soluble part thereof, to flat-bottomed 15x140mm counting tubes with screw caps. Each counting tube ultimately should contain 3.0 ml ash solution. Doall transfer over pans layered with absorbent paper. Label each tube with original data B.Fill the remaining counting tube with :3 0 ml. 3N HCI. This thirteenth tube will be used to obtain a back-ground count which will be subtracted from the other twelve readings. to obtain a figure for any radioactiveincrease in the barley roots.C Using the scintillation well counter. obtain a radioactive count from all tubes. (Most scintillation coun-ters have simple directions printed directly on the machine). 4614744. All radiation detectors that respond by emitting a flash of visible light are classified as scintillators or fluors.Most scintillation counters today combine a fluorescent tube and a multiplier phototube. The total light outputof the fluorescent tube is functionally related to the total energy lost by a moving charged particle in the tube.If the fluorescent tube makes good optical contact with the multiplier phototube, the light produced in the fluores-cent tube liberates electrons photoelectronically from the photosensitive surface on the face of the tube. Byapplying appropriate voltage increments between successive dynodes of the tube, these electrons are acceler-ated. and at each dynode secondary electrons are produced. Because of this electron miltiplication, the finaloutput of the tube is an electrical pulse of sufficient magnitude to be counted. The light is counted electronical-ly and read as cpm, or counts per minute.2. Record the cpm for each of the twelve samples in the chart, figure four. The background count will bethe count from the thirteenth tube, filled only with 3N HCI. which will be subtracted from each sample toobtain a net cpm for each sample Sample CPM3N HCI CountNet CPM 1Minute 5 Minutes 10 Minutes 20 Minutes 30 Minutes 24 Hours Temperature Refrigerator Room Incubator C.

Compare and explain the results with the two plants. 469479 Optional ActivityStudents may wish to experiment with soilless growth on vascular plants. The following are directions onhow to set up an experiment on mineral deficiency cultures with a vascular plant. The plant chosen for thisexperiment is a tomato plant, but corn plants may be substituted, as their mineral requirements are similar.These solutions are based on Hoagland's Solution #1, which was first published in a California AgriculturalExperimental Station Circular, #347, in 1938.Hoagland's complete and mineral deficiency solutions may also be purchased from biological supplyhouses.A. Wash 18 one quart mason jars in lukewarm water, rinse three or more times with tap water, plus threetimes with distilled water. The jars are usually painted or whitewashed to prevent sunlight striking the roots.Prepare solutions in duplicate in these jars, using the compositions as given in the table, figure eight, proceed-ing as follows. Fill the jar three quarters full of distilled water, then add the mineral components one by onewith graduated pipettes, stirring with a large stirring rod after each addition. Bring the level in each jar to withinthree centimeters of the rim with the addition of distilled water, and stir again. Fit a cork to each jar. Labelthe jars as to type of solution, today's date, and your name. Milliliters of Stock Solutions per One Quart FeEDTA, is the iron chelate of ethylene-di-amine-tetra-acetic acid, made up to contain5 mg. Fe per ml. The micro-nutrients are compiled using Haas and Reed's \"A to Z\" solution which is madeby weighing out the following ingredients and dissolving them in 1 liter of distilled tomato seedlings for uniformity of shoot and root length. Record the average lengths. Alsoselect them for uniform sturdiness and vigor. Drill holes in the corks of the jars so that the seedlings may beinserted in the holes. Also drill a small hole for the aerator. Insert the seedlings root first into the corks, securethem firmly but not too tightly with small wads of non-absorbent cotton, and place them in the jars. Avoidletting the roots dry out during these manipulations.C. Place the jars on a designated area of a greenhouse bench, insert capillary glass aerators, connect theaerators to the air-line, and turn on a fine stream of bubbles (aquaria air pumps will suffice). Leave the plantsfor two or three weeks.D. Nutrient solutions should be changed every two to three weeks. and the experiment should be con-tinued until deficiency symptoms are obvious. Normally this will take six to eight weeks.E. At harvest, cut the tomato shoots off just above the corks. Place root and shoot in separate labeledpaper bags, dry for 48 hours in a 70\u00b0 C. ventilated oven, and weigh. Report the weights, average the twoplants per solution, and compare this average against the average weight of the plants grown in a completenutrient solution.Students may also wish to record the pH of new and used nutrient solutions. Tomato plants grow bestin a slightly acidic environment, such as pH 5 to 5.5. They have difficulty growing in a pH of 7.0 or greater.ResourcesBiddulph, S. and 0.

Laboratory: Introduction to the AlgaeLaboratory: pages 163 - 1741. Answers will vary depending on the algae selected.2. Observation.3. Students should identify the word Thallophyta from thallus (Gr. thallus. a sprout) which means a complete plant bodywithout specialized conducting tissues and without parts resembling roots, stems, and leaves. Those Thallophyta whichcontain chlorophyll pigments are for the most part algae. Other pigments may occur in addition to the chlorophyllsAlgae may be single celled plants or multicellular with an organization varying from filaments to plate-like growth ordichotomously branching thalli.4. Answers will vary depending on the algae selected.5. See the characteristics listed in the chart, page 163 of the laboratory. Additionally, life cycle characteristics and biochemicalactivity should be considered.6. Zoosporangia house zoospores which are produced by mitotic division and hence are vegetative cells.

Answers will vary depending on the outside reading sources to which the student has access. However, all answersshould include the idea that biochemical changes are of a far more fundamental nature than structural and othermorphological changes. Color is superficial in that there are many shades and variations possible: however, the pho-tosynthetic pigment itself is not a superficial marker. Pigments may be added, but the primary biochemical methodof photosynthesis is a basic indicator in 180 - 1941. Answers will vary.2. They are algal fungi requiring a complex growth medium which is as yet undetermined.3 and 4. Chytrids have zoospores and motile isogametes with a single posterior whiplash flagellum, similar to the algae.Most are intracellular parasites. but the apple trap chytrids remain attached to the surface of the host and extractnutrients by means of haustoria, similar to many fungi. Most remain spherical or ellipsoidal, like some algae, andonly some develop small coenocytic mycelia, like other fungi. They are the most primitive of the fungi.Chytrid sporangia release, usually through an operculum, uniflagellate naked swarm cells. These swarm cells func-tion as zoospores or as isogametes. according to the species and the circumstances. There are many chytrids in whichonly the asexual cycle is known.5 Answers will vary.6. Clear.7 Branched. However, the branching may not be evident if the individual strands are well developed and long.8. Nonseptate.9. The hyphae are coenocytic.10. Yes.11. Answers will vary. However. most students will say yes.12. The bread.13. The sporangia are borne on aerial hyphae called sporangiophoh..b which are supported by strong lateral hyphae calledstolons. Mitosis occurs within the sporangium. forming many spores between the outer limiting wall and the centralcolumella. 500507 14. Because they are the product of mitosis.15. Male and female are terms traditionally used when there is a difference of the meiospores, generally in size. Thereare no observable size differences in the plus and minus strains of Rhizopus.16. Isogamous.17. Students should draw a line between all areas where plus and minus strands meet.18. Mating would have to be initiated between the unknown and known strains of plus and minus fungi.19. Some fungi can be mistaken for algae, if they possess photosynthetic pigments. Some algae are coenocytic, andmany are filamentous, like most of the fungi. The Phycomycetaceae possess numerous flagellated spores, similarto the fungi.20. Saprophyte: also, it can be weakly parasitic on fruit such as strawberries.21. Lack of propinquity. Most Rhizopus in a given area are of the same strain.22. They are similar.23. borne in fours at the tips of conidiophores which are divided into two or more branches, each ofwhich terminates in a chain of mitospores. The sexual cycle in most ascosporangia produces meiospores in chainsof eight. Often Penicillium has been placed in the Deuteromycetaceae because the sexual cycle has been so rarelyfound. In Penicillium the ascosporangia hold meiospores in chains of four.25. Because they are borne on conidia.26. Answers will vary.27. Division is not equal.28. Meiosis occurs in a zygote formed by the fusion of two equal or unequal uninucleate cells. The zygote enlarges tobecome an ascus, and the diploid nucleus then meiosis, with the four resulting haploid nuclei maturinginto ascospores, or dividing into eight and then maturing.29. They can be interchangeable.30. Conidiospores are mitospores borne Ascospores are within an ascus.31. Mitospores are borne on conidia, and eight meiospores are borne within an ascus. Sexually and asexually Clavicepsis an ascomycete.32. Answers will vary, but they should include all aspects of agriculture which depend on grain crops.33. The major portion of fungi life is hidden: the reproductive phase is the only one which \"surfaces.\" a necessity forspore dispersal.34. For nutrient gathering and support.35. Observation.36. On the hymenium the students will see the asci. Each ascus contains eight ascospores in a single row.37. Because of the angle it is cut at. or because of the maturity of the ascus.38. The hymenium gives rise to the spores, not only in fungi but in living organisms generally.39. Eight.40. Shallow cup shape with a short stalk. Depending on the ascocarp. they can range in size from 2 cm. to as muchas 30 40 cm. across.41. Observation and thought.42. At the base of the stipe.43. The hymenium bears slender stalks called sterigmata, on which the spores are borne.44. Observation. 501508 45. Basidiospores are borne on club-shaped structures (basidia) and are entirely the product of a dicaryotic mycelium.Often teliospores (resting stage consisting of two or more cells) are formed. Meiosis occurs in the basidium, withtypically four cells produced per basidium. Often the original nucleus of the basidiospore divides mitotically, so thatthe basidiospore is binucleate.See the answer to question #28 for a discussion of the sexual cycle in ascomycetes.46. The Lycoperdaceae (puffballs) are very similar to other basidiomycetes, with the exception of the structure of theirfruiting bodies and the position of the basidiospores. A puffball has an outer layer, the peridium, with an inner spongylayer of mycelia, called the, gleba. Spores are borne on the capillitium which is formed from parts of the gleba. Atmaturity the peridium tends to rupture, and wind or other disturbances cause the basidiospores to be dischargedinto the air.47. Lichens are combinations of algae and fungi. Several different algae and fungi can be involved.48. Warm and wet.49. They seldom do much damage to the reservoir host plant, such as the barberry or gooseberry. but they can destroythe other host plant, such as wheat or the white pine.50. Parasites.51. In the stem of the wheat.52. Two, a plus and minus strain.53. Observation.54. Yes.55. Because the cold weather inhibits growth and transmission of the fungus.56. The barberry is an alternate host of Puccinea graminis, but it is not essential. The fungus can grow indefinitely byspreading from one infected grass to the next, especially in areas where the uredospores are not killed by extremelycold winters.57. New crops of uredospores may sometimes arrive in Canada via wind patterns which sweep the North Americancontinent. These uredospores come from the south where the winters are less severe. The wheat growing regionsof Northern Europe do not have this reinfection problem, because they are cut off from their southern neighborsby the Pyrenees, the Alps, and similar mountain 2051.A root-like structure, the rhizoid.2. Tan.3. Depends on the species, and the age of the moss plant.4.It is not a true root because it did not originate as a structure growing in a direction opposite from the stem.

They must be removed.19. The zygote begins life in the archegonium.20. The archegonium, and then the archegonial, or female gametophyte plant.21: Water trapped in the junctures between the leaves\" and branches. Of course, mosses cannot live in dry areas.22. Answers will vary.23. The capsules are parasitic on the leafy plant.24. Haploid. They are part of the gametophyte plant.25. Depends on the species.26.It is called fertile in that it produces spores, and sterile in that there is no product other than its own growth.27. There is no need for a capsule if the moss plant's spores are dispersed by water. If dispersal is by wind, or by anelaborate mechanism for \"shooting\" the spores with the capsule's operculum, then the capsule is a mechanical neces-sity. The more advanced mosses have capsules.28. Actually it is extremely difficult to distinguish protonemata from green algae, except by their environment. As soonas the protonemata produce buds, which are the forerunners of the moss plants, the differences are obvious..29. Gametophyte = haploid. Sporophyte = diploid.30. Yes. The 2N generations produce spores.31. Homothallic.32. Heterothallic.33.It is difficult. \"Leaves\" are two cell layers thick, and originate off branches in a symmetrical spiral.34. At the apex. or tips of the plant.35.It is similar.36. One kind.37. Two cell layers thick.38. The students may vary in this answer, but all should include a discussion of the angle at which the leaves\" are attachedto the branches.3'.Answers will vary somewhat depending on the specimen under study.40. By the flattened \"leaves\" of liverworts.41. Off the main \"branch\" or plant body.42. There is no differentiation of tissue in moss leaf\" structures. They do not arise from a true stem.43. They are haploid. and mu.ticellular. In fact, in most species they can be seen with the naked eye.44. On top of the antheridial disk.45. The student should compare cell shape and cell position. homothally and heterothally. Polytrichum antheridia aremulticellular but microscopic. while Marchantia have an elaborate eight lobed disk structure that is usually about1/2 cm. thick and quite visible to the naked eye. 503510 46. On the female gametophyte.47. One.48. The student should compare cell shape (Polytrichum is elongated and Marchantia is more flask shaped), and cellposition (Polytrichum archegonia are located at the apex or plant growing tips, and Marchantia bears its archegoniaon special upturned branches).

By describing roots, stems, leaves. perhaps reproductive structures, if they are on the specimen plant provided bythe instructor.2 Acain depending on the spe :imen provided for observation, the student should note the unusually long stem whichdevelops before the first leaf. Growth is apical!!+ meristematic, and many cycads have short. subterranean stems. Theage of a plant can be computed from the number of leaf bases, the number of leaves in a crown, and years' durationof a crown.3. Many have short, underground stems, like the rhizomes of ferns. Leaf arrangement and structure are similar, althoughcycads have a stiffer structure. Reproduction in cycads is very similar to the extinct seed bearing ferns. Many fernsare hereosporous, like the cycads.5001 3 4. The leaves have a heavy, thick cuticle with a thick-walled epidermis. The stomates are basically confined to the lowersurface and are usually sunken in small pockets. These adaptations all enable plants to withstand water loss in adry climate.5.

As each B cell matures in the bone marrow, it becomes committed to the synthesis of antibodies which recognizea specific antigen, or molecular pattern. The descendants of each such cell retain the same specificity, and thus theyform a clone of immunologically identical cells.12. Cancers fundamentally represent failures of the immune system. in that the system does not detect and destroy devi-ant cells as they usually do. Normal cells are transformed into cancer cells in many ways, with several categoriesof triggering agent. Both the triggering agent and the resulting cancer cell have bypassed the immune defense system.13. Self relates to those molecules, cells, and tissues which belong uniquely to an individual. Nonself relates to thosemolecules, cells, and tissues which are alien to the individual.14 Both B and T lymphocytes are produced in bone marrow. T lymphocytes are further differentiated in the thymus.B lymphocytes manufacture antibodies. T lymphocytes variously attack invading intracellular organisms and controlthe overall immunological response of an individual.15. Hybridomas are hybrid cells of a cancerous tumor and an antibody producing lymphocyte. Hybridomas, resultingfrom the fusion of one lymphocyte cell and one tumor cell secrete only one type of antibody, or a monoclonal antibody.23.

Observation. 514521 20. Corn seedlings, like most plants, are positively phototropic. and the phototropic response primarily occurs in thegrowth tip. Therefore, the growth tips in groups #1 and #5 should have bent toward the light, while groups #2 and/4 should not have been affected by the light, and group #3 should have exhibited a limited positive response to the light.21. Observation.22, 23. 24. and 25. Dish #4 should have shown the highest percentage of lettuce germination among those dishes inwhich light or its absence was the only factor. Dish #9 should also have shown a similar percentage; even thoughit was exposed to sunlight, the kinetin should have removed the inhibitory effects of the far-red light (irradiation)waves in sunlight. Lettuce seed germination is stimulated by red light and reversibly inhibited by far-red light. IAA.added to dish 07, should have had no effect on this process. However, GA does promote seed germination andthe breaking of dormancy, and the student may have had some germination in dish #6. These results taken as awhole are evidence for the existence of a pigment system which absorbs light wavelengths.U.S. government scientists at Beltsville, Maryland have conducted a series of investigations in this area and haveconcluded that this pigment system is based on phytochromes, pigmented proteins. Temperature interacts with lightin the germination of lettuce seed, and this variable was not taken into account in this experiment. Lettuce seedgermination promoted by red light may be thermally reversed as well as being reversed by far-red light. Also, thereis a decrease in lettuce seed sensitivity to light with temperatures above 25\u00b0 C. What were the temperatures underwhich the experiment was conducted?26. Observation.27. Peas demonstrate light responses similar to those of lettuce. See the above discussion, questions #22 through #25.28 and 31. Observation.29 and 32. See question /27.30 and 33. GA generally promotes the growth of intact plants, and promotes bolting and flowering in long-day plants.34. Observation.35. 36. and 37. Pot /1 is the control group from which the other three pots may be measured. Pot #1 should demon-strate that with removal of the apical bud, lateral buds will grow. Lanolin does not change this reaction. Pot /a treat-ed with 1% IAA in lanolin, demonstrates continued suppression of the lateral buds, showing that IAA is the auxinin the apical bud which suppresses lateral bud growth. The nutritional status of the plant can influence this suppres-sion. Therefore, if this experiment were to be conducted in different soil types, the results would vary. Pot #3, treatedwith 1% GA in lanolin, demonstrates that GA does not inhibit the formation of lateral buds, but the student mightnote that GA promotes internode elongation which IAA suppresses. Pot #4, treated with both IAA and GA, demon-strates that GA synergistically increases the action of IAA on lateral bud growth.38. Observation.39. Morning glories belong to a group of plants in which the photoperiodic response may be modified or even reversedby changes in temperature. Consequently, answers to question #39 will vary depending upon the temperature andits variations during the experiment, and for each class the results of this experiment will depend upon the tempera-ture, day and night, in the environmental chamber. Morning glories behave as a long-day plant at night temperaturesof 13\u00b0 C., as a short-day plant at a night temperature of 20\u00b0 C., and as a day-neutral plant at a night temperatureof 18\u00b0 C. This complex relationship between the effects of temperature and the photoperiod points up the fact thatenvironmental factors governing plant growth act by favoring certain chemical reactions in the protoplasm, at theexpense of others. The behavior of the plant is determined by the chemical reactions which occur under a givenset of environmental conditions.40. Answers will vary.41. Observation.42. Florigen rate seems to be affected not only by day-night duration but also by temperature. See question /39. Conse-quently the rate of florigen varies in relation to photoperiod and temperature interactions. Florigen is so potent thatexperiments have been conducted in which a short-day and a long-day plant, grown under short-day conditions.were grafted together. and the florigen from the short-day plant forced blooming in the long-day plant under short-day conditions. The reverse also is true. Experiments such as this suggest that all florigen compounds are the same.or very similar. and that florigen is not species specific. Isolation and description of the chemical would constitutea scientific breakthrough.43. Answers will vary, but all students should understand that the potential of having florigen available to the horticulturalindustry would be immense. 515r022 Review: pages 433 - 434Essaygood answers should contain the following:1. Auxins do not affect lettuce seed germination. ai gibberellins and cytokinens promote germination. How? Lettuceseed is stimulated by red light and inhibited by far-red, or infrared. Cytokinens stimulate lettuce seed in the samemanner as red light, but the reaction is not inhibited by far-red radiation. It is probable that cytokinens promote seedgermination in concert with IAA. Gibberellins are natural growth hormones.2. Short-day plants are those in which flowering is initiated as soon as the day length falls below a critical photoperiodof about 12 to 14 hours. Short-day plants usually bloom in the fail or spring. Long-day plants are those in whichflowering is initiated only when the day length is more than a critical period of 12 to 14 hours. Under artificial condi-tions. long-day plants will flower when continuously illuminated. Long-day plants usually bloom in the summer. Day-neutral plants, such as dandelions and tomatoes, bloom under a wide variety of conditions, Short-day plants mightbetter be called long-night plants, and vice versa. because it is actually the length of the night, rather than the day,which impacts the flowering process. Interruptions of only a few minutes in the length of the night may interfere.Street lights or even car lights have been known to disrupt flowering.See questions #39 and #42 of this laboratory for an answer as to how florigen interacts With gibberellin in the flower-ing response. and how this relationship interacts further with day/night length.3. Phototropism, a response to light, is regulated by IAA in the growth tip of a plant. Apical dominance is also main-tained by the presence of IAA in the plant's growth tip. Kinetin, in the presence of IAA, stimulates lateral bud growth.Apical dominance is controlled by a balance of concentrations between endogenous kinetin-like substances and IAA.Gibberellin promotes growth. especially internodal growth, bolting. and flowering. It has no effect on apical domi-nance by itself, but its effects with IAA are additive.29. Laboratory: Plant and Water RelationshipsLaboratory: pages 438 - 4491, 2. 3. and 4. Observation.5 and 6.

Factors such as corn seed age and variety, and the temperature at which the pot was stored, alsoinfluence germination. These variables were not factored into this experiment. The results of the experiment will bevalid for the seed variety and growing conditions.31. Observation.32. Xylem absorbs water in the root system and transports it upward into the plant, and phloem transports the water,nutrients, and minerals dissolved in water to all parts of the plant. If the xylem were blocked, the plant could notabsorb water. The plant would lose its initial water content through transpiration to the atmosphere and be unableto absorb more water from the flask. If the phloem were blocked, the plant would continue absorbing and usingwater from the flask. Therefore, the set-up with blocked phloem will show a greater weight loss. Water is taken upby xylem, distributed by phloem from the xylem. and eventually lost through plant transpiration, hence the correspond-ingly greater weight loss of the blocked phloem set-up.Review: pages 451- 452Short answer1. Water holding capacity is the field capacity, or maximum water content of a soil without waterlogging occurring.2. Permanent wilting percentage is the percentage of soil water left after a plant growing in the soil can no longer extractany of the residual water. 5165 23 3. Xylem absorbs water from the root system and carries it upward for use in the plant. Phloem transports food andminerals in a water solution downward and to all parts of the plant.4. Temperature increases plant imbibition, up to 25\u00b0 C.5. Adequate soil water is essential for seed germinatior:. The process of germination may be defined as that sequenceof steps beginning with the uptake of water and leading to the rupture of the seed coat by the radicle or the shoot.Cell divisions and enlargements in the embryo and an overall increase in metabolic activity accompany these steps,all of which require water.30. Laboratory: Mineral Absorption, Use, and Translocation in PlantsLaboratory: pages 458 - 4691. 2, and 3. Observation.4. No. Fe\" should have been absorbed into the barley roots in two stages. The initial stage should have been a rapid,passive uptake, followed by a period of equilibrium, and then another stage in which uptake was more slowly butuniformly accomplished. The second stage is demonstrative of an active, metabolic mineral uptake by a plant.5. Theoretically, if iron uptake by a plant is passive, temperature should have no effect. If iron uptake is active, uptakeshould increase as temperature rises. Because the second stage of iron absorption is metabolic, the student shouldhave noted that temperature increase does indeed increase Fe\" uptake.6. The amount of a similar competing ion available in solution is inversely proportional to another mineral's absorption.This is termed the carrier theory of absorption, and it is equivalent to saying that the plant cell's active carrier sitesdetermine the proportion of iron/manganese taken up. The proportion of iron or manganese in solution affects theuptake of the other.7. See questions 04. 115, and #6. Those conditions which favor optimum plant growth favor the mcst active iron ab-sorption rate. The absence of competing ions also favors the increased absorption of Fe\".8 and 9. Observation.10. Answers will vary, but students should note how pH affects absorption rate. Mineral uptake proceeds best underthe optimum growing conditions for the plant, and this includes pH. If a solution initially was not within the bestpH perimeter, the plant would not grow well in that solution. If a solution initially was within the plant's pH perimeter.but the pH of the solution changed because of utilization by the plant, plant growth would lessen over time.11. Observation.12. The complete solution.13 and 14. Answers will vary. because all missing nutrients are vital to growth. Students will find that carbon must beapplied for growth. and depending on location, might find that sulfur is the least vital for growth. However, sulfuris a major component of air pollution, and the plant may receive its sulfur requirements from the air.15. Iron functions in the synthesis of chlorophyll and also as a constituent of several oxidative enzymes. Studies havefound that when iron is absorbed in the dark, uptake of iron is favored by the root over the shoot. This is the oppositeof what happens in sunlight. Consequently. the plant grown for four weeks in a radioactive iron solution should havea strong concentration of radioactive iron in the roots and stems. The plant grown for two weeks in radioactive iron,and then for two weeks in a non-radioactive solution, will have definite but weaker radioactivity more evenly dis-tributed throughout the plant.Review: pages 473 - 474Essaygood answers should include the following:1.a. Translocation: the conduction of a soluble material from one place in a plant to another.b.It occurs in order to distribute and re-distribute minerals and nutrients to the areas of greatest need.2. See pages 453 454 where fully discussed.3. -aRadioactive tracers allow scientists to follow the translocation of salts from one area of a plant to another.b. Radioactive tracers allow scientists to quantify the amounts of mineral salts in different areas of a plant, which pro-vides clues as to how, how much, and where a plant uses the mineral.c. Radioactive tracers, by their redistribution in plants, chemically signal how certain plant life stages are initiated orfinalized, and at what points these stages or developments become irreversible. 5175 2 4 "}
