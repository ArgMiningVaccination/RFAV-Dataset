However, it is also known to have some symptom-like side effects - mostly ranging from minor to moderate. Some people have side effects from the vaccine, which are normal signs that their body is building protection. These side effects may affect their ability to do daily activities, but they should go away in a few days. Some people have no side effects, and allergic reactions are rare. Researchers report that side effects appear to be stronger from COVID-19 boosters than from initial doses of the vaccine, according to a new study published in JAMA Network Open. This cohort study was conducted using electronic health record (EHR) data from December 2020 to October 2021 from the multistate Mayo Clinic Enterprise. Participants included 47 999 individuals who had received 3-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. Data were analyzed from September through November 2021. Significantly increased reporting was found for low-severity adverse events such as fatigue, lymphadenopathy, nausea, and headache.

You might run a fever and experience body aches, headaches and fatigue for a day or two. Chills and swollen lymph nodes can also occur. Nausea, diarrhea and vomiting are other common side-effects for booster doses. These symptoms do not mean you are sick. They mean that your immune system is responding to the shots and building up protection against the coronavirus. Usually, the side-effects are mild, and should not stop you from getting a booster shot.

It is not exactly the vaccine which causes the side effects, but rather an indication of your immune system reacting to the vaccine. Immune system reactions are usually signs that our immune system is active and fighting an infection, whether from the actual disease or as reacting to the vaccine. According to experts, the side effects through booster shots may be stronger because the immune system reacts more strongly to succeeding vaccine doses. However, the absence of side-effects does not indicate a poor immunogenic response. It is worth noting that the symptoms after a booster are similar to the symptoms of COVID-19. This is because our immune system is trying to build immunity against COVID-19.

People are advised to avoid alcohol, smoking and junk food post their booster shot. It is advised to talk to a doctor before taking any over-the-counter medicine for any pain and discomfort experienced after getting vaccinated.

If adverse effects occur, they generally happen within six weeks of receiving a vaccine dose. A severe allergic reaction can cause difficulty in breathing, drop in blood pressure, swelling of the throat, or rashes. Anyone who had a severe allergic reaction after getting a particular COVID-19 vaccine should not get another dose of the same COVID-19 vaccine.

In a recent update, the Indian government has said that citizens planning to travel abroad are eligible to get a third (booster) dose of vaccine as soon as three months after the second dose. The announcement was made for the convenience of international travellers who need to meet such requirements imposed by other countries. People can book their third doses on the Co-WIN platform under the new rules.
