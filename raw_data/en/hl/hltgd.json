service, while promoting discovery and the generation of knowledge through research, with strong commitments to community engagement, diversity and inclusion. 1.2 Vision To be a global leader in dental education, research, patient care and service. 1.3 Values We value excellence through high -quality comprehensive dental care, cutting -edge research and learner - focused education. We support a culture of dignity , respect, support and compassion fostered through a diverse and inclusive environment. Hyperlink to UFCD Strategic Plan 2019 -2024 2.0 STANDARD OF PATIENT CARE 2.1 Philosophy of Patient Care The college philosophy of care is focused on the delivery of comprehensive patient -centered care that is evidence -based, appropriate and consistent with UFCD and American Dental Association (ADA) Standards of Care, and administered in concert with the educ ational and service missions of the college. Predoctoral patient care is delivered in multidisciplinary clinics within small group \"team\" based clinics. Specialty or graduate level care is available for pre -doctoral student patients when the case complexi ty requires. All pre - doctoral and graduate level patient care within the college is delivered under the supervision of faculty members in accordance with students' abilities. 2.2 Goal of Clinical Program The University of Florida College of Dentistry clinical program is a blend of clinical opportunities and assessment challenges designed to graduate a competent \"new\" dentist who is scientifically knowledgeable, technically competent, socially sensitive and committed to the highest standards of professi onal conduct. Attainment of \"competency\" shall not interfere with patient -centered care. Attitudes and behaviors inconsistent with compassionate care, refusal by the student to participate constructively in learning or patient care, derogatory attitudes or unprofessional conduct directed at patients, peers, faculty or staff, can be grounds for dismissal. A core component of patient -centered care and commitment to high standards of comprehensive care include the development of an individualized treatment p lan developed through an accurate, objective examination which addresses the patients' physical, cultural, and economic needs and concerns. Benefits and risks of treatment and non -treatment are discussed and informed consent is obtained. Care is delivered in a prescribed sequential order, in a timely fashion, and in a professional manner that protects patients' 9 confidentiality. Equally important is student assessment of the outcomes of care and compliance with quality assurance measures and the UFCD Standar ds of Care document. 2.3 Standards of Care The Standards of Care document was developed with input and consensus from the Dean, department chairs, directors, and the Clinical Affairs and Quality Assurance Committee. Students are introduced to these concepts in pre -clinical and clinical courses, and professionalism courses. Compliance with standards of care focused on treatment is reinforced by attending clinical faculty and staff and assessed by the quality assurance committees. The Standards of Care document is found in Appendix A of this manual. 2.4 Credentialing Standards for Clinical Faculty and Staff 1. CPR at BLS level 2. Annual HIPAA and Confidentiality Training 3. Annual Biosafety Training 4. Annual Physician Billing Compliance Training 5. Biennial Compliance Training 6. Continuing education requirements for dentists and registered dental hygienists equal to those required by the Florida Board of Dentistry 7. Maintenance of state issued licenses, permits to practice within the assigned position. 3.0 P ROTOCOL FOR MANAGING CLINIC MEDICAL EMERGENCIES The purpose of the protocol is to assure a prompt and appropriate response to a medical emergency in the College of Dentistry clinics. 3.1 Rules 1. Department chairs (or their designees) will be responsible for assuring that all assigned clinics are properly equipped and that all faculty and staff are properly trained according to the guidelines described herein. 2. All students, clinical faculty, and patient care staff will be current in CPR certification at th e Basic Rescuer for Healthcare Provider (BLS) level. 3. Oral Surgery (OS) faculty members and residents will be responsible for providing primary and/or backup support for emergency problems as needed. 4. The Shands Code Blue Team (5 -#-66) should be contacted if the seriousness of the emergency warrants. 5. Emergency phone numbers and emergency location room descriptions are placed on each phone. 6. Emergency phone number lists are posted centrally, near house phones in patient care areas. 3.2 Emergency Preparedness and In -Service Training 1. Unannounced emergency drills (simulated) may be held as needed, alternating among clinics. (These will not interfere with patient care procedures.) 2. At irregular intervals students may be summoned from chairside and presented with a simulated problem, such as respiratory arrest, shock, dyspnea, asthma, or cardiac arrest. Student rescuers will be selected at random. No attempt will be made to cover the entire student body. 3. Minimal requirements for students, clinical faculty, and staff will be current certification in CPR training (trained at the BLS for Healthcare Provider level), according to the College CPR Policy. 4. CPR courses are provided for students, faculty, and staff through a partnership with UFHealth and the \" CPRTraning\" progr am. (See APPENDIX Q for UF HEALTH SHANDS CPR TRAINING CENTER AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION COURSE REGISTRATION FORM form link 10 5. Clinic administratio n will inform faculty, staff and students when their certification is within 60 days of expiration. Individuals must enroll in the next available class or their clinical privileges will be suspended. (Exceptions, such as extended illness, a sabbatical, or extended leave for personal emergencies, will be considered on an individual basis.) 6. Inservice training is provided upon orientation to clinics and annually through myTraining with Course number: UFH_UFCDManagingMedicalEmergencies_OLT . Upon request clinic, administration will arrange with program and course directors for in-person/classroom training experiences. 7. Clinic Administration maintain s training records in the axiUm user profile and personal planner . 3.3 Oral Surgery Emergency Protocol for Managing Emergencies in UFCD 1. Upon observing a medical emergency (See APPENDIX R: Medical Emergencies: UFCD Definitions ), go to the nearest clinic phone and call Oral Surgery by dialing 9 -413-1143. If using a cell phone or a telephone outside UFCD, dial 413 -1143. This pager is reserved solely for medical emergencies. 2. This phone line is connected to pagers in Oral Surgery. The four digit room number entered will appear on each pager, and the OS team will respond. 3. As always, someone should stay with the patient and render supportive care until the OS team arrives. 4. Send someone to the main elevator on the first floor and the floor of occurrence to meet the OS responder. If the floor of occurrence is the first, second, third, or fourth floor, send someone to the OMFS Clinic door to direct the responders. 5. This is an unexpected outcome and should be reported as a clinical occurrence using the link in axiUm to IDinc (event reporting) . 3.4 UFHealth Code Blue Team Emergency Protocol (Direct Dial 5 -#-66) 1. To contact UFHealth Code Blue Team from inside the College of Dentistry, dial 5-#-66 (pause briefly after the 5 and # ). Tell the operator the location is the Dental Tower . Provide the operator with a phone number to call back (so a number for a manned phone) and do not hang up until the operator tells you she has all the information needed. IMPORTANT : Inform the operator that someone will be waiting at elevators 21 and 22 (Dental Tower front/main elevators). 2. Simultaneously, while the UFHealth Code Blue team is bein g called by a member of the clinic team, a clinic leader (faculty or admin) will direct the following activities until either Oral Surgery responders or Code Blue responders arrive: a. Direct two team members to begin life support. b. Direct a team member to pe rform the role of \"recorder\". The recorder must document the time the emergency started, and all details regarding the treatment of the emergency victim. c. Assign a team member to call Oral Surgery pager 9 -413-1143 and enter the four digit room location of t he emergency. d. Send a team member to get the medical emergency kit and emergency oxygen. e. Send a team member to get the UFHealth Code Blue Crash Cart. f. Send at least two team members to the first-floor elevator banks to hold the elevator for the emergency res ponders and direct them to the floor of occurrence. g. If above the first floor , send at least two additional team members to the elevators at the floor of occurrence so one can remain at the elevators while the other escorts the team to the emergency locatio n. h. Assign remaining team members to crowd control and arranging for the movement of non - essential persons from the area where the emergency is occurring (re -locate patients for completion of their treatment to another clinic location). 3. Following the emerg ency, the recorder will work with the patient's provider to make sure the event is properly documented in the patient record. 4. The unanticipated event must be reported as a safety event using IDinc, Event Management System (easily found in axiUm under Links on the toolbar) 11 5. Make certain that the details of the emergency are reported to clinic administration within 24 hours of the emergency (regular business days). 3.5 Emergency Medical Services (EMS) 911 . 1. If the major cardiac event or the OMFS Team deems the event worthy of transport to the UFHealth Emergency Department ( ED) and it occurs on the ground floor or floors four through eleven, 911 must be called. In any medical emerg ency on the Sun Terrace or in the Communicore, 911 must be called as neither UFHealth nor the UFCD OMFS Team respond to these areas. 2. In the case of a 911 call, UFCD staff should meet the emergency responders at the West Entrance of the UFCD building and gu ide them to the site of the emergency. 3.6 When to call the Emergency Department(s) Charge Nurse If the patient has presented with or developed symptoms that require discontinuation of treatment and referral to the Emergency Department (See APPENDIX R: Medical Emergencies: UFCD Definitions ) for further evaluation, contact 733 -0815 to report that you are transporting a patient to the Emergency Department. Be prepared to offer a report regarding the Situation (What is the problem, duration, severity) Back ground (medical history) Assessment and Recommendations (what do you want the ED provider to do) this is called a SBAR handoff . Be prepared to transport the patient to the ED. This is an unexpected outcome and this patient safety event should be reported by way of a link from axiUm to IDinc (event reporting). SBAR : Situation \u2014What is going on with the patient? \"I am calling about a patient we need to transfer to the ED. Patient appears to be in hypertensive crisis\" Background \u2014What is the clinical background or context? \"Patient is a 58 year old female presenting for routine dental treatment. No history of hypertension or cardiovascular issues, takes a statin drug for hypercholesterolemia. Assessment \u2014What do I think the problem is? \"Three consecutive manual cuff bp readings 5 minutes apart are as follows, 180/118, 182/118, 180/120 , rule-out risk of heart attack or stroke .\" Recommendation and Request \u2014What would I do to correct it? \"I feel strongly the patient should be transferred to the emergency department and assessed immediately?\" 3.7 Policies Regarding Basic Life Support (CPR) and Emergency Training 1. Overview UFCD is committed to providing a safe and secure environment for its employees, students, patients, and visitors. The College maintains the highest standards of care for its patients, which includes traini ng of clinical faculty, staff, and students to recognize and appropriately manage medical emergencies. Maintaining Basic Life Support skills (BLS) is a national standard of care in dentistry and dental hygiene, is required by many state boards for licensure, and is an accreditation standard for dental schools in the United States. Properly managing life -endangering medical emergencies that may 12 occur within the College requires maintaining current BLS skills by all students, clinical faculty, and staff. The College must assure that all students, clinical faculty and staff maintain their BLS skills, i.e., Card iopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and knowledge of medical emergency response protocols. Healthcare Provider Course - teaches all aspects of 1 - and 2 -rescuer adult, child and infant CPR, obstructed airway management for the conscious and unconscious victim, use of bag -valve -mask, risk factors, and access to the EMS system. Instruction in the use of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) is included. UFCD instructors are certified trainers. 2. BLS Provider Classes As part of the onboarding process predoctora l dental students, clinical graduate students, faculty and staff will provide a copy of their current BLS (CPR with AED training) certificate. Predoctoral and graduate dental students are required to complete the BLS training within two months prior to the start of their first semester in their program. The onboarding process of faculty and staff may allow the hiring manager to arrange for BLS renewal prior to access to the clinics and patient management system. BLS certification compliance will be ente red into the patient management database for predoctoral and graduate dental student users. Any student who begins a program out of sync with their cohort, is responsible for scheduling their renewal training by contacting CPRTraining@shands.ufl.edu and attaching a completed UF HEALTH SHANDS CPR TRAINING CENTER AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION COURSE REGISTRATION FORM (Appendix Q). The student is responsible for sending the Office of Clinic Administration a copy (pdf) of the new BLS (CPR with AED training) certificate. Clinical faculty and staff will receive BLS renewal training at no cost . Note: supplementary materials (e.g., manuals) for personal use must be purchased by the user. The clinician is responsible to schedule the training session by contacting CPRTraining@shands.ufl.edu and attaching a completed UF HEALTH SHANDS CPR TRAINING CENTER AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION COURSE REGISTRATION FORM (Appendix Q) The clinician is responsible for sending the Office of Clinic Administration a copy (pdf) of the new BLS (CPR with AED training) certificate. 3. BLS Training Records a. The Office of Clinic Administration maintain s a file of all predoctoral dental students, clinical faculty, and clinical staff reflecting the status of their BLS skills training. Clinic personnel are responsible for providing clinic administration with a copy of their AHA BLS course completion card. Clinic Administration will notify non -exempt personnel who do not have current training of the need to renew their cards within 60 days or risk suspension of clinical privileges. b. Students, clinical faculty, or clinical staff who cannot complete BLS training because of physical limitations or medical conditions must submit a written request for exemption, stating the reason for the request. In certain cases, the Associate Dean for Clinical A ffairs and Quality may request physician verification. The exemption forms will be kept on file in the Office of Clinical Administration. c. Exempted personnel are encouraged to periodically attend BLS Provider classes for the information value, even though they may not be able to complete the motor skills portion of the class. A letter verifying attendance should be issued 4. Student Policies Predoctoral students must complete BLS training for Healthcare Providers within July or August of the first year (pre-admission requirement). Renewal will be scheduled during semester 6. 13 Advanced education dental student applicants must present evidence of a current BLS/CPR course completion card prior to beginning their first academic year. Predoctoral students must present evidence of current BLS/CPR certification completed within two months of entering the predoctoral program. Thereafter, retraining at the Healthcare Provider Level will be available as needed to maintain certification. Students who are in nonco mpliance or have expired cards will have their clinical privileges suspended by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality until they can show evidence of completing an approved course. 5. Faculty and Clinical Staff Policies UFCD Human Resources will assure that newly hired full- and part -time clinical faculty, dental assistant and dental hygiene staff personnel possess a current AHA or ARC Healthcare Provider course certification. If not certified upon hiring, they must register for a class or file f or medical exemption prior to becoming involved in clinical patient care. The UFCD Office of Human Resources will assure that the Office for Clinical Administration receives notification of all new full - and part - time clinical faculty hired for addition to the database. Department chairs will likewise assure that all faculty undergo BLS CPR skills renewal at least every two years. 6. Non -Clinical Staff Policies Non -clinical staff, including administrative personnel, secretaries and receptionists are encourage d to maintain BLS/CPR skills, in the event their bystander skills might be needed in non -clinical areas or in the community at large. This training can be at the Heartsaver BLS level for non -healthcare providers. 3.8 Emergency Phone Numbers : Clinical Operations MEDICAL EMERGENCIES : Using House Phone Oral Surgery - First Responders within Dental Tower This is a digital pager; after you hear the series of beeps, you will enter the 4 -digit room location . Do NOT leave a voice message. Example, for room D3 -3 you would enter 0303. 9-413-1143 Medical Emergencies outside of clinics (floors 4 -11 and ground) 911 Code BLUE Team from UFHealth * For location of emergency, state to the operator \"Dental Tower\" Stay on phone until operator indicates it is okay to hang up 5-#- 66 UFHealth Emergency EMERGENCIES: FIRE 911 Facility Services (formerly PPD) 392-1121 University Police and Security 392-1111 UFHealth Operator 265-0111 Clinic Administration 273-6820 Dental Maintenance 273-8001 Housekeeping 273-9700 These teams (*) have been instructed to report to the floor to which they have been summoned.

If a failure occurs when not on an elevator, call the Dean's Office, 273 -5800, and report the details, or call 392-1121 (Facility Services). Any elevator malfunction should be reported (with details) to the Dean's Office. 6. Minor Emergencies in the Clinic Notify the attending faculty and then provide supportive care, using the minor emergency kit, if needed. Contact Oral Surgery if necessary. 3.11 Accidents and Reporting 1. Management of Major (Life -Threatening) Emergencies Provide supportive care, and identify someone to call Oral Surgery Emergency at 413 -1143 and/or the Code Blue Team (from UFHealth , 66; from the College of Dentistry, 5 -#-66). Be sure to enter the four -digit room location when paging Oral Surgery, and to provide the \" Dental Tower \" location to the Code Blue operator. Have someone meet the emergency responders at the doors of the UFCD main elevators (front elevators) and on the floor of the emergency occurrence. IMPORTANT : Inform the operator that someone will be waiting at \"Dental Tower\" elevators (front main elevators, #21 or #22) . 2. Management of Accidents a. Involving visitors i. When a visitor is injured or involved in an incident while inside or on the grounds of the Health Science Center, the employee witnessing or receiving the report of the incident to the Office of Clinical Administration (273 -6820) who will notify the Insurance C oordinator's Office (273 -7006), and then the employee should complete a patient safety report using IDinc -Event Management System , ii. If the visitor involved consents to emergency care, they should be taken to the UFHealth Emergency Dept. (ED) for examination and treatment if necessary. Do not coerce the visitor to go to the ED. Do not tell the visitor that the hospital's insurance will pay for ED charges as this is not always true. 15 iii. The Emergency Dept. physician will examine the visitor to determine the nature and extent of the injury, and will note the findings on the Incident Report form and in the Emergency Room Medical Record. The Emergency Room clerk will attach the charging document to the Incident Report and route it to the Insurance Trust Fund Office. iv. In all cases, an event r eport for accidents involving visitors will be reviewed by Clinic Administration . b. Involving patients These incidents will be handled in the above manner, except that examination and treatment may be done in the area in which the patient is being treated. Should the nature or extent of the injury require medical attention which is not available where the pati ent is being treated, the patient should be taken to the Emergency Dept for emergency services. For emergency services call 733-0815, to report that you are transporting a patient to the Emergency Department. Be prepared to offer a report regarding the Si tuation (What is the problem, duration, severity) Background (medical history) Assessment and Recommendations (what do you want the ED provider to do) this is called a SBAR handoff (see section 3.2) . Be prepared to tra nsport the patient to the ED. Routine Emergency Dept administrative procedures will be carried out in such cases and the completed Incident Report form will be sent to the Office of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . Appendix B contains flow diagrams for handling medical emergencies. 3. How to Report an Incident a. Incidents should be reported by phone immediately to the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs 273 -6820. b. When a patient or visitor is involved in an accident and declines or refuses to be transported to the Emergency Dept., a Patient Safety Report IDinc (Event Management System) should be completed immediately . In addition to the link in this sec tion, this form is also available through the links button on the ribbon in axiUm.

If you find that a cart or airway box lock has been broken, call clinic administration (273 -6820) immediately so that a cart refresh may be initiated . For the locations of the hospital Code Blue Tea m Crash Carts ( Crash Cart ) see table 3 -12.2 in the preceding section . 18 The crash carts are to be used fo r medical emergencies which have escalated to a higher level of emergency response, either by Oral Surgery responders or by the hospital Code Blue team responders ; for example, heart attack, respiratory distress, and or stroke. Items that do not belong on the cart should never be placed on the cart (drink cups, etc.). The sharps container is for use only during a code blue type emergency and never for gen eral clinic needle disposal. The cart must remain plugged into the electrical outlet between uses for emergencies (charging battery for suction machine). Each cart has a manual with lists of the contents. In the event of a Code Blue emergency, the crash cart is to follow \"clean handling \" protocols, meaning with clean hands only. No gloved or contaminated hands should contact the cart. If it so happens that contaminated hands are used on the crash cart, the crash cart must be labeled as contaminated and the exchange protocol should be amended to prevent cross contamination with the UFHealth Central Distribution Center. 3.14 Protocol for Prevention of Aspiration/Ingestion of Foreign Bodies 1. Rationale The University of Florida, College of Dentistry is committed to the highest quality of clinical care and safety for all patients. As part of ongoing quality assurance endeavors, this protocol is designed to facilitate a reduction in foreign body aspiration/ingestion events during dental treatment and to ensure appropriate patient management. 2. Prevention Protocol a. Patient Evaluation The clinician should review the health history of the patient to identify any neurological, psychological, systemic, and pharmacological problems that might contribute to the poten tial for aspiration or ingestion of an object and take measures to minimize the risk. Examples of these concerns, not intended to be all -inclusive, include the following: i. Neurological - seizure history, stroke, dementia ii. Psychological - extreme anxiety iii. Systemic - chronic cough, allergies, esophageal stenosis, scleroderma with restricted opening ability, trismus, GI reflux or nausea iv. Medications - Haldol can increase involuntary muscular activity as in tardive dyskinesia. b. The clinician (student, resident or faculty) should review the procedure with the patient, carefully explain the risks, and elicit the patient's cooperation. For example, the patient should be instructed to stop speaking during this time and signal if they need to cough or sneeze, to preven t aspiration. i. Dental Dam Utilization Whenever possible, a dental dam should be used during restorative and endodontic procedures to prevent aspiration/ingestion of broken teeth, instruments, and amalgam fragments. Floss should always be tied to the dental dam clamp before placing on the tooth. ii. Throat P rotection II.a For all surgical procedures (e.g., extractions, periodontal surgery, implant placement and cementation procedures), a modified throat pack should be employed by placing a sterile gauze block as a barrier to block the oropharynx. Floss may be tied around a tooth in particular situations to avoid an accident with medically compromised patients. iii. Alternative Throat Protection Devices: 19 Providers and dental auxiliary who are properly trained to use ISO VAC, ISODRY, ISOLITE devices may select to use these when a dental dam is not indicated. Such as with nonsurgical periodontal treatments/therapies, or fixed prosthodontic procedures. iv. Equipment Verification Assure that handpieces are properly maintained to prevent parts from breaking away during use. Prophylaxis cups, brushes, and latch type burs must be properly attached to prevent dislodgment of a cup or brush or instrument breakage. Always verify the handpiece bur is properly engaged to prevent loss of a loose bur in the opearatory, and/or the patient's oral cavity. Ultrasonic tips must be set at the proper power level based on the tip being utilized. v. Provisional Restorations All provision al restorations (single units and fixed partial dentures) should be fabricated from a radiopaque material, when feasible, to facilitate radiographic identification in the event it is ingested or aspirated. Cements should also be radiopaque, when feasible. vi. Restorative/Implant Procedures Floss should be attached to all p in wrenches and implant hardware and screwdrivers when used on a patient in a supine position. vii. Endodontic Procedures Dental dam isolation must be employed at all times Cementation Procedures The patient should be positioned with the head tilted toward the s ide receiving the restoration, instead of the head positioned straight upward. This position may protect the airway and help prevent aspiration. When feasible for a fixed bridge, floss should be attached to the restoration or prostheses prior to beginning the \"try -in,\" occlusal adjustment, cementation, and/or sectioning procedures. Floss embedded in Duralay may be beneficial when manipulating smaller castings such as onlays . 3.15 Protocol for Referral to ED of Adult Patients Suspected of Ingesting a Dental Device during a UF Dental Clinic Procedure (Dental Swallow Protocol) Purpose: The goal of this protocol is to improve efficiency, provide timely endoscopic procedures when indicated, and enhance patient care and satisfaction. Protocol: When Dent al faculty determines that (1) an item may have been ingested during a dental procedure, (2) the patient is clinically stable, and (3) the airway was not impacted, the following process will be followed: I. Referral to the ED for evaluation and treatment if necessary: A. The Dental team calls the UF Health Shands Hospital Transfer Center at 352 -265-0559 and initiates the \"Dental Swallow Protocol\" B. The Transfer Center connects the Gl consult fellow (352 -219-0328) or Gl consult attending (if fellow not availab le) to the dental team for discussion of the case. C. The dental team sends a generic picture of the suspected item by email or text to the Gl fellow. D. If the decision is made to proceed with evaluation, the Transfer Center connects the Gl attending/fellow to the ED PIC to notify her/him that the patient is being sent to ED for evaluation. E. The patient is escorted by the dental service to the ED. F. Upon arrival at the ED, the patient is registered and triaged in accordance with standing orders for patients who are suspected of swallowing dental devices, to include. 20 1. Consult placed to Gl 2. Order for an abdominal flat plate, upright and lateral x -ray on a STAT basis (standing order set containing the dot phrase \"Ingested foreign body from dental procedure, contact Gl c onsult fellow if photo of object is needed) G. The Gl team follows up on the x -ray and sees the patient in the ED and determination is made if an endoscopy is appropriate. 1. If not, the patient is provided instructions and discharged. 2. If so, the timing of the procedure is discussed and endoscopy is arranged by the GI team. The GI team will communicate this to the ED Physician. The procedure is handled as usual for ED patients needing an endoscopy. The patient is assigned a room, an iv is placed and anesthesia i s contacted per routine. Discharge from the ED is anticipated after endoscopy. Note that an endoscopy order cannot be placed in EPIC unless there is a room assignment in the ED. This order activates scheduling, anesthesia, etc. H. GI and the ED place notes in the patient's medical record indicating the event and actions. II. Other issues A. If the patient is unable to give procedural consent, the dental team will identify the person responsible and provide contact information to GI team. B. The Dental faculty will enter a Patient Safety Report and notify SIP. C. Not intended for nights, weekends, other ingestions or food impactions, pediatric patients (<18 yr) Pathway for Protocol Approval Dental School: Dr. Cesar Migliorati, Assoc. Dean of Clinics and Quality (GI fellow). Transfer Center: Dave Hudson Emergency Department: Wendy Swan, and Tom Payton Eric Palacio 734-358-3873 with any questions ) 4.0 PATIENT INFORMATION AND PATIENT CARE 4.1 Patient Screening The College provides an information sheet to patients at the screening appointment. Please refer to Appendix I . 4.2 Clinic Hours 1. The College of Dentistry TEAM student clinics are open from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday Tuesday, Thursday & Friday, and 2:00 -4:30 p.m. on Wednesdays, except on holidays. Each care group will conduct a pre -clinic meeting or \"huddle\" from 8: 15-8:30 am eac h day (1:45 -2:00 p.m. on Wednesdays) that the clinics are open for patient care. Students, staff, attending faculty and team leaders are required to attend the huddles. 2. Patient treatment begins at 8:30 a.m. and 2:00 p.m. The lunch break provides adequate t ime to prepare for the afternoon session. (This includes preparation up to the point of obtaining a start check and opening sterile instruments.) 3. Plan clinic sessions so that any procedures can be finalized by 11: 00 a.m. for the morning session and by 4: 00 p.m. for the afternoon session. Patients should be out of the clinics by 11:30 A.M. and 4:30 P.M. each day . This schedule allows ample time to clean and complete records before leaving. 21 All students should be out of the operatory and the clinic by 11:45 am and 4:45 pm respectively. Chronic offenders will be suspended from the clinics. 4.3 Clinic Access 1. Advise patients that they cannot bring their children with them into the clinic while they are having dental treatment. The College cannot provide child care or assume responsibility for the safety of the child. 2. All minor patients and certain adult patients will require the presence of a third party or legal guardian to validate certain responses to the health questionnaire and to obtain informed consent. Adult patients presenting as poor historians or with evidence of inadequate decision -making capabilities should be identified during screening in order to insure that a responsible third party will be available to obtain informed consent. The third party will be needed at the initial data - gathering appointments and may be allowed in the treatment operatory for limited periods of time only for the recognized purposes listed above. 3. Also advise patients that, except for unusual circumstances (such as a recog nized disability), they cannot invite their friends or family members into the dental operatory during dental treatment. This is due to OSHA and infection control regulations. If the patient has a question regarding this policy, please ask a facul ty member or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . 4.4 Patient Rights The Patient Rights & Responsibilities document is part of our combined consent form which is reviewed with the patient during the intake process with patient services. The patient signs the combined consent prior to receiving any treatment with UF dental practices. A copy of the Patient Rights & Resp onsibilities document is offered to the patient at the initial appointment. Please see Appendix J to view an example of this form. All students, faculty and staff receive training on the UFCD Patient's Rights while orienting to work in the UFCD clinics. St udents are trained as part of their curriculum, and faculty and staff are trained through myTraining with Course number: UFH_UFCDPatientAdvocacy_OLT 4.5 UFCD Confidentiality Policy 1.

Before being assigned patients, students must have completed the following requirements: Completion of HIPAA, Confidentiality Statement, OSHA -Biosafety Training and Biomedical Waste (BMW) ; Physician Billing Compliance Training 2. Completion of Basic Life Support (BLS) Certification Trainin g along with Medical Emergency Training. 3. Assignment into the TEAM Program During the spring of the sophomore year, students will be assigned to one of 8 teams. Each team will consist of one facu lty team leader, a treatment coordinator, dental assistants and dental students. The T EAM Leader becomes the student's academic advisor for the remainder of the program. Each team will meet with their Treatment Coordinator and faculty TEAM leader to determine patient scheduling, discuss patient treatment progression, and participate in educational activities such as case presentations, journal reviews, and ethical dilemma discussions. The TEAM program must be viewed as part of a pedagogical philosophy of the College, supporting the philosophy of patient -centered comprehensive care. 4.7 Screening and Patient Assignment: 1. All patient assignments must be made by the appropriate designated faculty or staff member working in conjunction with the Office of the Clinical Administration. Assignments are entered in axiUm, EHR. With the exception of rotations, it is a violation of c linic policy to treat a patient that has not been assigned or transferred. Most of the assignments made to students at the University Of Florida College Of Dentistry are for TEAM comprehensive care management. This means that the student is responsible for all the dental needs of an assigned patient --from the stage of examination, diagnosis, and treatment planning to providing sequenced care, assessing outcomes of care, and establishing supportive periodontal therapy. 24 2. The Director of Screening and Patient Services will assign each student an initial family of patients. This family of patients is selected to meet, as closely as possible, the student's educational needs. 3. Self-recruited Patient : A friend or acquaintance can be assigned to the student to meet certain comprehensive care educational needs through a \"self -recruitment\" procedure. The patient will be scheduled in the Screening Clinic to complete a screening evaluation of the patient to assure that the prospective patient's dental needs meet the UFCD educational requirements and the student's current level of competency. The student will participate in the screening process through his attendance, exposing all appropriate radiographs (wi th faculty signature), and requesting the patient be assigned . The patient will be assigned to the student in axiUm as a comprehensive care patient. 4. All comprehensive care patients treated by students in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry are assigned to the Pediatric Dentistry faculty and maintained by that department. Students may treat patients during rotations in Pediatric Dentistry, Student Oral Surgery Clinic (SOS), and at off -site rotations that are not assigned to the student. However, all other comprehensive care patients for the pre -doctoral program must be assigned to the student by the Director of Screening and Patient services or designee . 5. If treatment needs warrant, patients may be referred to an advanced education student (resident) or a faculty member as applies. 4.8 General Pre -doctoral Clinic Policies NEVER seat a patient in an operatory until at least one attending faculty member has arrived in the clinic . Be certain that the patient's name appears on the schedule. 1. It is mandatory for the dental student to obtain a \"Start Check\" from the supervising faculty member. The start check process includes a review of the medical history and recording vital signs, and case presentation by the student dentist to the faculty . At the \"Start Check\", the faculty supervisor must observe that your instrument pack is sterile and has not been opened. Start check needs to occur within the first 30 minutes of the clinic session. 2. Attempt to see the patient at least every 30 days (minimum). Ev ery two weeks is preferable. 3. Attendance: Link to Student Handbook - SECTION G, Student Attendance, Absence, Leave and Parking Policies - Leave Policy for the TEAM Clinic 4.9 Appointing the Patient 1. Initial Contact Using the personal planner in axiUm, the student may open a list of their assigned patients by selecting \"assigned patients\" and the search button to populate the list. The list is an active page in the patient management system allowing the student to sel ect the patient record directly from the list. The student will also be notified of patient assignments by the messenger module in axiUm (Patient Management System) and must treatment plan the patient within four weeks of assignment, however, two weeks is preferable. Be sure to advise the patient that children/ visitors are not allowed in the clinic due to safety concerns. The College cannot provide childcare or take the responsibility for child welfare. Also , advise the patient that except for unusual cir cumstances such as a recognized disability, friends or family members are not permitted in the dental operatory during dental treatment. This is due to privacy, safety and infection prevention standards . If the student or the patient has a question regardi ng this policy, please ask a faculty member or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . 25 When contacting the patient by phone, always make sure to verify the patient's date of birth and/or phone number/address before communicating PHI with the patient. Document all telephone conversations or other contacts in the contact notes (located in the patient card in axiUm) on the date contacted, or as soon as possible thereafter . 2. Treatment Planning The first appointment with a new patient will usually be for the start of treatment planning. Following the steps below will minimize confusion for the student and the patient: a. Obtain and review the new patient's record. Note previously reported health problems which may have been noted in the forms tab on th e medical history form(s), screening assessment or in the contact notes, a history of \"no -shows,\" or financial problems. b. If radiographs appear adequate and current, complete a radiographic interpretation. This must be done before presenting a diagnostic wo rk-up. If additional radiographs are necessary, they can be scheduled and obtained during the initial appointment. Prior to completing a treatment plan, an interpretation of all new radiographs is to be completed. c. The patient will be scheduled for the f irst appointment with the assigned student dentist for a comprehensive examination, diagnosis and tentative treatment planning. This consists of a thorough review of the patient's medical/dental history, a comprehensive extra/intra oral examination (includ ing periodontal evaluation), an oral health risk assessment, caries risk assessment, and endodontic consultation, followed by the development of a properly sequenced problem list, diagnosis list, and propose an appropriate treatment plan. d. When you call the patient to introduce yourself prior to the initial appointment, inform the patient that a medication history must be recorded. Therefore, remind the patient to bring all medications (labeled medicine bottles) or to bring a complete list of medications to the appointment. Also inform the patient that he /she will need to bring the Medicaid card, if appropriate, and the name and telephone number of the ir physician(s). e. Inquire as to whether or not the patient is in pain and establish any needed appoint ments in the Student Oral Surgery Clinic prior to initiating the examination/diagnosis/treatment planning appointment. Confirm the length of time of the appointment (approximately 3 hours) so that the patient can plan accordingly. Remind the patient of the anticipated fee. Since diagnostic casts will be required, plan on taking dental impressions on the first visit. Often, supplemental consults can be obtained in the patient's absence with quality casts, current radiographs, and the patient's record. The ne ed for consults (other than Radiology) will be directed by the attending faculty at the initial appointment. f. The attending faculty's review (with approvals) is required on the medical history, extra/intra oral head and neck exam, caries risk assessment, oral health risk assessment, odontogram (dentition chart), periodontal health evaluation, and treatment plan before therapy can be initiated. g. Failure by the student to keep a scheduled appointment at the appointed time or to cancel an appointment witho ut informing the treatment coordinator may result in a professional variance (please refer to section 8.0 of this manual). 3. Treatment Planning - Disease Control Evaluation Upon completion of ALL initial phase operative treatment and periodontal therapy that includes scaling and root planning, every comprehensive care patient must receive a Disease Control Post - treatment Assessment. This assessment is required prior to moving to the definitive phase treatment. The re -evaluation should include a thorough review of the Disease Control Treatment Plan and validation of the completion of those treatments at a satisfactory level. The instructor may discuss the treatment rationale, antimicrobial treatment, future plans for outcomes 26 assessment (bacteriological culture), and health maintenance with the student and the patient as part of this evaluation. 4. Patient Communication - Form Letters The treatment coordinators will have computer -generated form letters for use in routine communication with patients. A copy of all correspondence with a patient will be maintained in the patient's record and notations must be made in the contact notes. 5. Cancellations and Broken Appointment s Conversations or other contact actions (left message on voice mail) with the patient regarding cancellations and broken appointments must be recorded in the contact notes in the electronic record. If a patient calls any time before the appointment hour and explains inability to keep the appointment, an event is called a \"cancellation.\" If a patient fails to call before the appointment hour or calls after the time for the appointment, this is a \"broken appointment\". An explanation for a broken or cancelled a ppointment should be documented in the contact notes. Before leaving the clinic, advise the treatment coordinator that the patient failed to keep the appointment. Student failure to keep a scheduled appointment or a \"student no -show\" will adversely affect clinical performance and could result in the loss of clinic privileges. 4.10 Limited Care Patients 1. Limited Care Endodontics Some patients (who are not Comprehensive Care, or otherwise assigned for care) may initially present to the Student Oral Surgery Clinic and receive a secondary referral for stabilization of a tooth by the Endodontic Clinic. The Endodontic Clinic may accept the patient by referral and initiate endodontic treatment to relieve pain and retain a tooth. If a patient is accepted for limit ed care by the Department of Endodontics, the following guidelines will apply: a. At the beginning of the endodontic procedure, a determination of tooth restorability must be made in the progress notes using the endodontic evaluation form. Prosthodontic and periodontal consultations should be obtained to confirm that the tooth is restorable. b. The patient is to be told (and will sign an appropriate release) that following the completion of the endodontic part of the treatment, the tooth should have a final resto ration or the tooth may be lost due to fracture and/or recurrent caries. c. Upon completion of the endodontic therapy, the tooth must be temporized so as to be reasonably stable and maintained for a period of at least 3 -4 months. d. The patient is informed regarding the need for definitive restoration. 2. Low Needs Patients please review Table 4.10 -2 for the minimal paitent record compliance requirements for a patient who is categorized with \"Low (dental) Needs\" Table 4.10 -2 Minimal Documentation Requirements axiUm Process Current Medical History OSHHX or DMDHX Oral Cancer Evaluation Findings TxNote, Diagnostic Codes Intraoral Exam Findings Odontogram, PerioTab and TxNote Request Treatment Plan TxPLan Module 4.11 Patient's with Medical Risk Health care professionals are responsible for providing comprehensive oral health care to all people; children (6 -21 years), adults, (over 21 years), medically -compromised and disabled. 27 People with special needs are defined as individuals who have medical disorders, physical limitations, intellectual impairments, or psychological/social conditions that impact the delivery of oral health care. People with special health care needs, including those aged 0 -5 years, often require more time, effort and accommod ation by the dental team. In addition, the dental team may need to modify their routine treatment procedures in order to provide care that is appropriate for the needs of the individual. Dental students at the University of Florida provide comprehensive or al health care to people with special health care needs which include the following disorders or conditions.

If for some reason a patient refuses to continue treatment, a registered letter must be sent to the patient with a return receipt requested in the following situations: 1. Patient has provisional restoration(s). 2. Patient is mid -treatment in an endodontic procedure. 3. Patient has been advised to have a biopsy procedure. Patient discharges can be made only through the office of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality by the Patient Advocate. Discharge of all \"routine\" patients must be cleared as described above. Patient Transfer/Dismissal Summary forms are in axiUm and must filled out completely before sending to the faculty Team Leader for approval. Once the form is approved it may be sent to the Patient Care Coordinator (administrative staff aka Treatment Coordinator) for review before being sent to Clinic Administration for final review and assignment update. This is a three step qualit y and administrative review process to assure a patient centered approach is being honored. Patients whose recommended treatment has been completed, and therefore are ready for discharge or maintenance, must be seen by faculty in the TEAM Clinic for a post -treatment assessment case completion exam. At this exam, with the student present, the patient will be evaluated to determine that the planned treatment was delivered, that the delivered treatment meets College standards, that the patient is satisfied with his care, and that no further treatment is necessary. Only then will the patient be discharged from the associate pair . 4.13 Urgent Care Needs of Comprehensive Care Patients 1. Patients that are actively assigned for care by a Student Dentist (SD) will be provided with contact information for the SD's Treatment Coordinator . a. During regular clinic hours the patient will be routed to the SDs Team/ Care Group (CG) for urgent care needs. If the SD is available, he/she will attend to the patient's urgent needs. If the SD is not available, then the Team Leader will assign another SD within the CG to attend to the patient's urgent needs i. Patients who call the Clinic Administration numb er (273 -6820) will have their call forwarded to the appropriate TC. ii. Patients who present at the Patient Registration window with urgent issues will be asked to take a seat while the attendant locates the appropriate TC b. During Clinic Breaks: The patient wi ll contact either Clinic Administration or the TC. If the TC for the SD is present she/he will coordinate with the Team on duty for the appropriate plan of care for the day; otherwise, the TC for the Team on duty for urgent care will handle the arrangement s. Patients needing to be seen on these days will be scheduled in the pre -doctoral dental emergency schedule and attended to by the supervising faculty dentist and the dental students hired to help cover team patients' emergencies during the brea k. c. If it i s determined that the patient may require an extraction, then the TC will coordinate with the Student Oral Surgery (SOS) front office to schedule the patient for care in the SOS clinic. 2. In the case of the screened and/or accepted patient for the TEAMs cli nics, who has not yet been assigned for comprehensive care: Calls from this person for urgent needs go to the Student Oral Surgery (SOS) clinic, where he/she will be informed how to become a patient by participation in the lottery. This person should be present at the SOS clinic by no later than 6:45 AM on the days that SOS is open 29 a. SOS is generally open M -F, but the caller should be encouraged to check with SOS either by going online to our website, or by calling the clinic. b. During breaks, SOS is generally open only Tuesday -Thursday. An exception occurs when a holiday falls within these days, or relatively close to these days . c. Persons who call the college of dentistry after hours for emergencies that cannot wait until the next day will be encouraged to seek emergency care at the local Emergency Department. If the emergency is life threatening, then the caller will be instructed to hang up and dial 9 -1- 1; otherwise, he/she will be encouraged to call back during office hours to coordinate urgent dental care nee ds with an appointment coordinator (in the SD clinics it will be the TC). 4.14 Appointment Scheduling in Student Dental Clinics 1. Student Dentistry patient appointments are to be set by the Treatment Coordinator (TC) for each Team in the Care Group (or an approved designee). The student may assist the TC ) with calling patients to set appointments only after he/she has attained a short list of dates the TC ) determines are available for the student to see the patient. Students should use the provided clinic phones to contact patients, and provide the patients with the call back information for the TC. 2. The student dentist must enter planned appointments into axiUm from the approved and signed treatment plan in order for the Treatment Coordinator to be able to schedule appointments for the patient with the student. 3. Endodontic referral patients: The student dentist names will be maintained on an active rotational list in the Pre -Doctoral Endodontic List. As referrals from outside clinics come into the Endodontic Clinic, As referrals from outside clinics come into the Endodontic Clinic, the student and their TC will be contacted via an Axium message with the patient's demographics. The student then contacts the potential patient to introduce themselves and explain the procedure and associated fees. Once the potential p atient has agreed to schedule an appointment, the student creates a Planned appointment and messages their TC to contact the patient for scheduling a. If the patient fails to make an appointment, then the student's name will return to the top of the list, and he/she will be in line for the next referral. b. If the patient presents for the appointment and is not treated (i.e. tooth gets extracted, pt. refuses treatment, etc.), the student's name will return to the top of the list. 4.15 Patient Care Procedures f or Students Approaching Graduation The treatment philosophy for the predoctoral program at the College of Dentistry is that of patient -centered comprehensive care. Consistent with that philosophy, students are strongly encouraged to complete all care for e ach assigned comprehensive care patient. Equally important is maintenance of continuity of care. As graduation approaches, transfer of care within the TEAM family is facilitated. One of the advantages of the TEAM Associates Patient Care Concept is seamless transfer of patients, with the approval of the TEAM leader. Transfers are allowed, with the approval of the student's TEAM Leader, under the following circumstances: 1. The date of assignment is so close to the student's projected graduation date that the student could not complete the care specified by the treatment plan. 2. The planned treatment was interrupted by the patient's medical concerns. 3. The original treatment plan was subsequently changed to a more complex plan (requiring additional appointments) w hich exceed the student's remaining time in school. 4. There was an unavoidable delay in some phase of treatment not under the student's control, e.g., orthodontic treatment or substantial delay in healing. 5. Patient transfer from one provider to another will be approved when the timeliness and continuity of care is enhanced for the patient . The TEAM leader or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality will review the proposed transfer of a patient. These individuals will determine if the patient' s care should be completed by the student who 30 wishes to transfer the patient. If the decision is made that the student should complete the care, no transfer will be allowed and the student must complete the case to meet graduation requirements. If the grad uating student has not completed care for reasons beyond his control, the TEAM leader will review the progress and attempt to reassign the patient to another TEAM member. Graduating students should have a final disposition completed for each patient prior to two weeks before graduation, and only a few patients should require an additional disposition during that final two -week period. Post -Treatment Assessment - Case Completion reviews are conducted prior to discharge for patients with completed care. In the event this cannot be arranged, the record shall be reviewed by the Director of Screening and Patient Services (or designee) . The patient should be reassigned to a rising 3DN to complete the Post Treatment Assessment - Case Completion assessment. If that is not possible, the Director will review the case prior to patient discharge. The student who receives the newly transferred patient must review the health history and complete an updated oral evaluation including head/neck exam, obtain appropriate departmental consultation and, if indicated, review and/or formulate a new treatment plan with the attending TEAM leader prior to commencing with additional patient care. 4.16 Treatment and Contact Notes 1. Treatment notes must only be used for treatment or assessments. Contact notes are available in the patient card, and are to be used for notes regarding contact with the patient. 2. Treatment notes must include specific information about the patient's status before the procedure was initiated, health history review and vital signs, medications and materials used, steps of the procedures performed, and the patient's condition at the termination of the appointment. The following criteria for treatment notes have been established. a. With the electronic record, it is a best practice to avoid using abbreviations. However, when abbreviating words in creating a t reatment not e, use only the College of Dentistry accepted abbreviations as listed in the Clinic Manual (Appendix F). b. Treatment note entries using a general note format , should be complete and concise, and should include patient's chief complaint in their own words, a review of systems and the vital signs, a description of clinical findings, description of the procedure performed including materials and medications administered, comment regarding treatment outcome including the patient's disposition, and brief description of upcoming planned care. c. A brief medical history review/update must be the initial entry for all cl inical procedures. d. A brief medical history review/update must be the initial entry for all clinical procedures. e. Treatment note entries must list all materials used in a clinical procedure f. Medications, anesthetics and their dosages and sites/routes of admin istration must be recorded. g. Entries of prescription information must use the \"prescriptions\" tab in the electronic health record in axiUm and will include the following: i. Name of drug, dose form, and amount ii. Directions to the pharmacist iii. Directions to the pat ient iv. Refill instructions, labeling information, and permission for substitution h. All student dentist entries into the treatment record must be approved by supervising faculty. i. Treatment plan revisions must be recorded in the treatment notes as well as resul t in an updated treatment plan signed by the patient. j. Unexpected outcomes must be r ecorded in the treatment notes; however, there must not be any reference to quality assurance reporting (such as IDinc) in the patient's treatment note. 4.17 Record Audits 31 1. Patient records are audited in all programs by individuals designated by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality. a. Pre-doctoral program - Chart reviews are conducted on all assigned active patients each semes ter, by the TEAM program b. Advan ced education programs - Chart audits are conducted by the Associate Dean for Advanced Education or designee (Program Director) c. Peer Review Process - a predetermined number of patient records is randomnly selected by the chair of the peer review committed f or a monthly review. 2. Random patient record audits may be conducted by the Assistant Director for Clinical Affairs and Quality, in all programs on a routine basis. 3. Focused audits are conducted on students' charts upon request of TEAM leaders or the Associ ate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . Focused chart audits may be conducted by the Assistant Director for Clinical Affairs and Quality, if a routine audit suggests a concern that merits further review. 4.18 Informed Consent 1. Obtaining informed cons ent is a process whereby the patient is informed of the treatment proposed, the need for the treatment, risks of the procedure, alternative treatments, and the consequences of no treatment. This is an extremely important process which must be explained to the patient in words and language understandable to the patient. This should be performed by the assigned student who will perform the procedure(s), and re -enforced by the attending faculty. If staff initially provides the \"consent form\" to the patient fo r his review, it should be reviewed by the doctor performing the procedure to allow the patient the opportunity to ask questions of the doctor. 2. All patients receiving treatment must give informed consent in writing. Informed consents must be appropriately signed, dated, and witnessed. They must be obtained from individuals legally authorized to give consent. 3. For more information regarding obtaining proper consent refer to Appendix N . 4.19 Persons Who May Consent to Non -Routine Medical/Surgical Treatment and Sign the Permit 1. Patients 18 years of age or older or legally emancipated, are considered able to make their own decisions regarding health -care, and therefore no other consent is required (Florida Statute 743.07[1]). 2. The following individuals under 18 years of age may give consent if they are: a. Under 18 and ever married (Florida Statute 743.0 1). b. Under 18, female, and consenting for care or service related to her pregnancy or her child (Florida Statute 743.065 [2]). c. Under 18 and consenting to care for a sexually transmitted disease, alcohol, or drug dependency. NOTE: An unmarried male parent under 18 may not give consent for himself. He must have consent from a parent/guardian. 3. For minors under age 18 , who cannot consent as described above, the followin g may consent: a. Either parent b. A court appointed guardian c. A person specifically designated in a court order as having capacity to consent to non -routine medical care . d. A relative who has been awarded an Order for Temporary Custody by Extended Family . e. HRS, bu t only if the child is permanently committed as a ward of the state (i.e., all parental rights have been terminated) NOTE : A grandparent or other relative who has custody of the child due to an informal arrangement or who has power of attorney from an abs ent parent may not consent to surgery or general anesthesia. 32 4. Consent shall not be obtained from a patient is who is not competent, and the health care provider responsible for obtaining consent shall determine if the patient is competent to consent. If the patient is not competent to consent, document such in the medical record and obtain an opinion regarding competency from a second provider or the primary care physician. 5. For an adult patient (except a developmentally disabled adult), when two provid ers document that the patient is not competent to grant consent, others may consent on his behalf in the following descending priority: a. A court appointed guardian, authorized to consent to non -routine medical/surgical care, after presentation of valid guardianship papers . b. A Health Care Surrogate designated by the patient prior to his incompetence . c. If the patient has no guardian and did not designate a health care surrogate prior to his incompetence, consent may be granted by the following individuals. ( A note must be made in the chart, by the physician, indicating that the selected individual is acting as the patient's proxy, willing, and available to consent.) i. The patient's spouse ii. An adult child of the patient or, if the patient has more than one child, a majority of the adult children who are reasonably available for consultation , or a parent of the patient iii. An adult sibling of the patient, or if the patient has more than one sibling, a majority of the adult siblings who are reasonably available fo r consultation iv. An adult relative or friend of the patient who has exhibited special care and concern for the patient and has signed a Close Friend Affidavit v. For a developmentally disabled adult who is not capable of consenting for himself, only a court a ppointed guardian or guardian advocate may consent vi. A patient or patient's representative who is unable to write shall make a \"mark\" as his/her signature. The witness(es) to the signing shall use full signature. vii. In an emergency, when the patient is unable o r an appropriate individual is not available to consent, two attending providers must document in the medical record (after independent examinations) the existence of the emergency and that the proposed procedure is necessary to preserve the life or health of the patient. Written notification of an appropriate individual shall be accomplished as soon as possible, and a signed written authorization for treatment will be requested. viii. In the case of a dental emergency, parental/guardian consent by telephone is p ermissible if witnessed by at least two college faculty or staff members. The conversation should be documented in the dental record and signed by the witnesses. 4.20 Patients with Disabilities Every effort will be made to accommodate patients with disab ilities. If a student or patient has questions or needs assistance (for example, to provide sign language interpretation for a hearing impaired patient), contact the Office for Clinical Affairs at 352 -273-6820. 1. Hearing Impaired Patients a. UFCD recognizes tha t patients with hearing impairment have the right to emergency and elective dental treatment, and that this right may require UFCD to provide necessary assistance to the patient. b. UFCD will make every reasonable effort to provide patient assistance for emer gency dental treatment. However, assistance may not always be available on short notice. c. To arrange for patient assistance, the dental student or faculty member providing treatment for the patient must contact the Patient Advocate in the office for Clinica l Affairs as soon as possible before the appointment. Assistance can be assured only with at least a two week notice. d. When assistance is requested, Social Work Support Staff will be contacted. Patient assistance 33 will then be coordinated through the Social Work office e. UFCD (Gainesville locations) will be billed as follows: Business hours (Monday - Friday, 8:00 AM - 5:00PM) $170 for the first two-hour s of service during regular business hours. Additional business hours time is charged at $21.25 per 15 minutes. After hours (Monday - Friday between 5:00 PM and 8:00 AM, all day Saturday and Sunday, and all standard holidays) $180 for the first two hours of service and after - hours (after 5:00PM on a S/S/H) additional time is $22.50 per 15 mins f Mileage i s charged for trips greater than 110 miles from the Center for Independent Living of North Central Florida. The fee is 0.445 per mile round trip. 2. Adult Protective Services Act ( Elder Abuse - \"Vulnerable Adult\" Fl statute 415.1034 http://www.flsenate.gov/Laws/Statutes/2012/415.1034 The Legislature recognizes that there are many persons in this state who, because of age or disability, are in need of protective services. Such ser vices should allow such an individual the same rights as other citizens and, at the same time, protect the individual from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. It is the intent of the Legislature to provide for the detection and correction of abuse, neglect, and exploitation through social services and criminal investigations and to establish a program of protective services for all vulnerable adults in need of them. It is intended that the mandatory reporting of such cases will cause the protective services o f the state to be brought to bear in an effort to prevent further abuse, neglect, and exploitation of vulnerable adults. In taking this action, the Legislature intends to place the fewest possible restrictions on personal liberty and the exercise of consti tutional rights, consistent with due process and protection from abuse, neglect, and exploitation. Further, the Legislature intends to encourage the constructive involvement of families in the care and protection of vulnerable adults. A health professional who knows, or has reasonable cause to suspect, that a vulnerable adult has been or is being abused, neglected, or exploited shall immediately report such knowledge or suspicion. Management of patients who are suspected to be victims of abuse according to the Florida Adult Protective Services Act should be discussed with the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs and the Chief Executive Officer. Any person 60 years of age or older who is suffering from the infirmities of aging or other physical, mental, or emotional dysfunction to the extent that the person is impaired in his/her ability to adequately provide for his own care or protection is eligible for these services. A person 18 years of age or older who suffers from a condition of physical or mental inc apacitation due to a developmental disability, organic brain damage, or mental illness, or who has one or more physical or mental limitations which restrict his ability to perform the normal activities of daily living is eligible for these services. Florid a Statutes mandate any person who knows or has reasonable cause to suspect that an aged person or disabled adult is being abused, neglected, or exploited shall immediately report such knowledge or suspicion to the Florida Abuse Registry on the state toll f ree telephone number: 1 -800-96-ABUSE. Adult protective services investigations will begin within 24 hours of receipt of a report of possible abuse. At the completion of its investigations, reports will be classified as Unfounded, Closed without Classifica tion, or Proposed Confirmed. Referrals will be made to criminal justice agencies, the state attorney, the Human Rights Advocacy Committee, Long Term Care Ombudsman Council, and the Office of Licensure and Certification as appropriate. Adult Protective Serv ices staff will evaluate and assess the need for ongoing protective social services, emergency removal, protective placement, and other necessary social service supports as deemed 34 necessary and appropriate in each individual situation. Any person required by Florida statute to report a case of known or suspected abuse, neglect or exploitation of an aged person or disabled adult who knowingly and willfully fails to do so or who knowingly and willfully prevents another person from doing so is guilty of a misd emeanor of the second degree. 3.

Service animals must be on a leash, wear a harness, or be in a carrier while in the clinic. The care and supervision of a service animal is solely the responsibility of his/her owner. Staff i s not required to supervise or care for a service animal in accordance with the ADA guidelines (Sec.36.302 (c) (2). The facility is not required to provide care, food, or a special location for the animal. Service animals may not enter areas where invasive procedures are being performed. A service animal may be removed from a clinic if that animal's behavior poses a direct threat to the health and safety of others. Non -service animals are not allowed in clinic for the protection of patients and staff. 35 4.21 Reporting of Injuries Resulting From Acts of Violence The attending faculty directly involved in the discovery and treatment of the patient with injuries resulting from acts of violence shall immediately contact Patient Advocate and the Associate Dean fo r Clinical Affairs and Quality . Unless otherwise required or authorized by law, the reporting of injuries to law enforcement without patient consent may be considered a breach of patient confidentiality. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality, and the Patient Advocate will coordinate reporting with Legal Services. 790.24 Report of medical treatment of certain wounds; penalty for failure to report. \u2014Any physician, nurse, or employee thereof and any employee of a hospital, sanitarium, clinic, or nursing home knowingly treating any person suffering from a gunshot wound or life -threatening injury indicating an act of violence, or receiving a request for such treatment, shall report the same immediately to the sheriff's department of the county in which said treatment is administered or request therefor received. This section does not affect any requirement that a person has to report abuse pursuant to chapter 39 or chapter 415. Any such person willfully failing to report such treatment or request therefor is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083 . 1. In accordance with Florida law, 790.24, the following injuries must be reported to the appropriate authority, the county Sheriff's Department: a. Gunshot wounds and other wounds indicating violence must be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency. b. Incidents of d omestic violence should only be reported if otherwise reportable as a gunshot wound or other wound indicating violence, or if the victim consents. c.

If a patient has for gotten to take his antibiotic premedication, the options are as follows: a. The attending faculty may write a prescription and send the patient to Shands Outpatient Pharmacy or any pharmacy of the patient's choosing. After taking the medication and waiting th e appropriate time, treatment can proceed. 36 b. The patient may be reappointed. c. An individual department may wish to provide antibiotics for the premedication for that single appointment, following the appropriate guidelines. 2. In the event that a faculty member decides antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary after a procedure has been initiated or completed in a susceptible patient, the faculty member must obtain appropriate medication to be administered within the two -hour window recommended by the American Heart Association. 3. The attending faculty in each clinical area is responsible for prescribing medications for their respective patients. 4. All medications must be prescribed by a properly credentialed faculty and must be recorded in the electronic record and chart and in the medication log present in each clinic ( Appendix K ). 5. The medication container/envelope must also bear the following information: practitioner's name, patient's name, date dispensed, name and strength of the drug, and directions for use. 6. Medicati ons dispensed according to these guidelines must be dispensed at \"no charge\" to the patient. 4.23 Management of Hypertensive Patients Requesting Elective Care 1. Patients presenting for elective dental care with a blood pressure reading > l65/95 mm. require a medical consult and/or physician referral prior to continuing treatment. The blood pressure reading should be verified via two accurate recordings with the proper cuff and at least 10 minutes apart. (In general, \"rushing\" to an appointment will primarily increase the systolic blood pressure but have much less effect on the diastolic pressure.) 2. Any patient with a diastolic reading >110 mm. should be immediately referred to their physician with a medical consultation as appropriate. 3. Any patient w ith a diastolic reading >120 mm. should be referred to Shands Emergency Department (ED). The attending dental faculty should contact the ADTC nurse in the ED (5 -5-0930) and request the nurse evaluate the patient for possible transport to the ED. An entry s hould be placed in the dental chart stating that patient was sent to the ED \"stat\". A medical consultation request form must be completed and signed by the attending faculty to determine status, and all elective dental procedures are suspended until the p hysician consult request form is returned to the College. 4.24 Guidelines for Management of Pregnant Patients Requesting Elective Care A pregnant patient, while not considered medically compromised, poses a unique set of management considerations for th e dentist. Dental care must be provided for the mother without adversely affecting the developing fetus. The first trimester (first three months) is when organogenesis occurs. The fetus is most susceptible to malformations during this period. The goal of d ental care is to minimize the risk of exposure or avoid it whenever possible. The reference to Pregnancy Risk Factor (PRF) and the letter A, B, C, D, or X immediately following, signifies the Food and Drug Administration Pregnancy categories. (Refer to t he list below for a summary of the categories.) The recommendations listed below are only guidelines and may not always apply. Treatment decisions must be made based on the status and needs of the individual patient in consultation with her obstetrician as appropriate. 1. Treatment During Pregnancy Based on Trimesters a. First trimester i. OHI ii. Plaque control iii. Avoid elective treatment 37 iv. Urgent care, but the dentist must do whatever is necessary to relieve pain and infection. (Febrile illness and sepsis have been a ssociated with miscarriage early in pregnancy.) v. Local anesthesia: lidocaine, PRF B is acceptable , vi. As PRF C, consider carefully vii. Analgesics: with codeine. Avoid aspirin and NSAIDs. viii. Imaging: All films necessary to establish the diagnosis should be exposed with appropriate shielding. ix. Antibiotics: Penicillin and clindamycin are acceptable to use as both are PRF B. x. Avoid tetracycline as it is PRF D. xi. Avoid metronidazole in the first trimester, due to carci nogenicity in rats. xii. Avoid benzodiazepines as they are D. (Risk for clefts) xiii. Avoiding nitrous oxide sedation during pregnancy is suggested. b. Second Trimester i. Emergency care ii. OHI, Scale, polish iii. Routine dental care - unless pregnancy has complications. Alw ays monitor blood pressure. c. Third Trimester i. Emergency care ii. OHI, Supragingival scaling iii. Routine care is provided for the first 2 -3 weeks of the third trimester. Beyond that, routine care is usually deferred until the baby is delivered. This is primarily for the comfort of the mother. This will avoid inferior vena cava syndrome, or supine hypotensive syndrome. d. FDA Pregnancy Categories (Pregnancy Risk Factor) Reference: Drug Information Handbook for Dentistry , Lexi -Comp, Inc. 2013 -14 A Controlled studies i n pregnant women fail to demonstrate a risk to the fetus in the first trimester with no evidence of risk in later trimesters. The possibility of fetal harm appears remote. B Either animal reproduction studies have not demonstrated a fetal risk but ther e are no controlled studies in pregnant women, or animal -reproduction studies have shown an adverse effect (other than a decrease in fertility) that was not confirmed in controlled studies in women in the first trimester and there is no evidence of a risk in later trimesters. C Either studies in animals have revealed adverse effects on the fetus (teratogenic or embryocidal effects or other) and there are no controlled studies in women, or studies in women and animals are not available. Drugs should be gi ven only if the potential benefits justify the potential risk to the fetus. D There is positive evidence of human fetal risk, but the benefits from use in pregnant women may be acceptable despite the risk (e.g., if the drug is needed in a life -threatenin g situation or for a serious disease for which safer drugs cannot be used or are ineffective). X Studies in animals or human beings have demonstrated fetal abnormalities or there is evidence of fetal risk based on human experience, or both. The risk of the use of the drug in pregnant women clearly outweighs any possible benefit. The drug is contra indicated in women who are or may become pregnant. IMPORTANT: These are only guidelines and do not always apply. Treatment decisions must be made based on the status and needs of the individual patient in consultation with her obstetrician. 4.25 Biopsy Specimens and Cytologic Smears When patient history, clinical examination, or appropriate diagnostic tests indicate a need for microscopic examination of abnormal tissue, the tissue must be removed and submitted for histopathologic examination. 38 The decisi on to submit tissue for histopathologic examination is done according to the UFCD Guidelines for Removal of Human Tissue. All tissue which is submitted to the UFCD Oral Pathology Laboratory Service must be accompanied by a completed biopsy/cytology request form and signed by the attending faculty member. Following microscopic examination, the original histopathologic report will be scanned into the patient's axiUm record. It is the responsibility of the submitting student dentist to notify the patient pers onally of the results of the histopathologic examination for patients of the pre -doctoral program. If the patient does not return for follow -up or cannot be contacted by telephone, the student dentist must send a registered letter to the patient's home add ress advising them to contact the student dentist to discuss the results of the biopsy procedure. Florida statues prohibit the mailing of biopsy results directly to the patient. All attempts to contact the patient and all discussions with the patient conc erning the biopsy results must be documented in the patient record. Inform the patient that he will receive a separate bill from the Biopsy Service at UF for reading the pathology specimen. Pathology services are usually covered under medical insurance. 4.26 UFCD Guidelines for Removal of Human Tissue Submission of tissue removed from patients for microscopic analysis is the established standard of care to ensure accurate diagnosis and optimal patient care. It also provides written documentation and conf irmation of diagnosis, which may be important for risk management and medico legal considerations. The following guidelines represent the accepted management parameters for UFCD patients: 1. Informed consent must be obtained prior to removing tissues from a patient. (The exception would be dentin and enamel removal during routine and dentin, cementum, associated pocket epithelium removed during periodontal scaling and root planning.) 2. Other than the tissues exempted in (1.) above, all patients will be given the option of submission of their tissue for histopathologic examination. (The patient will also be informed of the associated oral pathology lab fee 3. All tissues removed for the follo wing indications must be submitted for histopathologic examination.* a. All procedures identified as hard or soft tissue biopsies b. Radiographic alterations or lesions in bone where tissue removal is indicated to determine or confirm the diagnosis includes but is not limited to: i. All hard or mixed hard and soft tissue removal ii. All apical or periradicular surgical procedures c. Soft and/or hard tissue alterations i. Where tissue removal is indicated to determine or confirm the diagnosis ii. When there is no response or reso lution after conservative treatment to establish adequacy of surgical margins *Tissues removed by UFCD faculty while treating UFCD patients must be submitted to the UFCD Oral and Maxillofacial Pathology Biopsy service or to the Shands Hospital Surgical Pathology service as appropriate. d. In defined situations, at the discretion of the attending faculty, alterations to this policy could be applied. i. Extirpation of pulp tissue removed during non -surgical endodontic proced ures. At a minimum, the tissue will re ceive a gross visual examination. If the tissue appears grossly consistent with the clinical diagnosis (e.g., irreversible pulpitis or pulpal necrosis), and the attending faculty determines submission for histopathologic examination is not indicated (will not alter diagnosis, treatment or prognosis), or the patient is offered but declines microscopic analysis, the attending faculty will so designate in the progress note and sign. ii. Extraction of Teeth : At a minimum, extracted teeth (without soft tissue attached) 39 should be described in the progress note to include tooth number, and diagnosis or reason for removal. The progress note should state that gross examination is consistent with the clinical diagno sis (e.g., non -restorable due to advanced caries). 1. If extraction is associated with orthodontic procedures, the progress note should indicate that the teeth were unremarkable in appearance. 2. If a periapical or periradicular radiographic lesion is associated with the extracted tooth, and/or if soft tissue remains on the tooth when delivered, appropriate tissue should be submitted for histopathologic examination. If the patient declines tissue submission, the gross visual description and the patient declinatio n should be recorded in the progress notes and signed by the attending faculty iii. Soft/hard tissue removal associated with periodontal surgical procedures including gingivectomy and/or gingivoplasty , tissue debulking and recontouring, clinical crown lengtheni ng procedures to facilitate impression making or excessive donor tissue from grafting procedures may not require submission for histopathologic examination in the absence of signs or symptoms of pathology. If the patient declines, at a minimum, gross visua l inspection confirming the tissue is consistent with the clinical diagnosis should be so noted in the chart and signed by the attending faculty. iv. Pre-prosthetic surgery (e.g., alveoloplasty, tori removal) Tissues removed during pre - prosthetic surgery may r eceive histopathologic examination. If the patient declines, at a minimum, gross visual inspection verifying tissue was unremarkable in appearance should be entered in the progress notes and signed by the attending faculty. NOTE : In instances where micro scopic examination of ti ssue is offered and recommended to a patient but the patient declines such service, the record should document that fact and the patient should co -sign the entry. Appropriate patient care is our primary concern . If the attending f aculty determines a specimen should be submitted for histopathologic examination to confirm the diagnosis of a serious systemic disorder, a neoplasm, or a malignant condition, the specimen must be submitted regardless of the patient's financial status. In these rare situations, the College will assume financial responsibility for this service. 4.27 Guidelines for Removal of Restorative Hardware 1. Offer the removed restorative hardware to the patient a. IF the patient accepts the removed restorative hardware; then, i. Render removed restorative hardware non -biohazardous by following CDC/Florida Statutes - Guidelines (decontaminate) and, ii. Turn removed restorative hardware over to patient before departure (same day) b. If the patient declines the removed restorative hardw are; then, i. Render removed restorative hardware non -biohazardous by following CDC/Florida Statutes guidelines (decontaminate) and, ii. Turn removed restorative hardware over to Clinic Administration (same day) 2. All \"non -metal\" restorative hardware is to be dispo sed of by following CDC/Florida Statues guidelines 4.28 What to do when you suspect a patient may be a victim of Human Trafficking What is Human Trafficking? Human Trafficking is the recruitment, harboring, transporting, providing or obtaining, by any me ans, a person for labor or services involving forced labor, slavery or servitude in any industry, such as forced or coerced participation in agriculture, prostitution, manufacturing, or other 40 industries or in domestic service or marriage (Freedom Network, based on the federal criminal law definitions of trafficking). Warning Signs of Human Trafficking : Chances are there's going to be nothing visible, nothing that you can see from across the room, or even from up close, that should alert you that a stranger is being trafficked. That may come as a surprise - especially if you have been to a training where you have been taught the 'signs' or indicators of trafficking, such as a person looking disheveled, upset or scared. But as we learn more about how traffick ing really works, we are also learning that the best way to help is to pay attention to people you actually know or interact with - your students, your tenants, your children, your patients, your co-workers. It is all about two magic words: Context and pro ximity. Research shows that the majority of human trafficking survivors had some contact with the health care system during the time they were being exploited. That means health care providers are often in the position to recognize that something is wrong and take steps to provide support. Potential red flags specific to a health care setting may include: A patient with reproductive or sexual health concerns and or potential signs of sexual violence and reporting an unusually high number of partners A patient with work -related injuries reporting that health and safety gear were not provided or conditions were otherwise unsafe A patient is unwilling or hesitant to answer questions about the injury or illness A patient Is accompanied by an individual who does not let the patient speak for themselves, refuses to let the patient have privacy, or who interprets for them How to report Human Trafficking: If you have information regarding suspected Human Trafficking of a child in Florida please contact: Florida Abuse Hotline, 1(800)96 -ABUSE or 1(800)962 -2873 If you have information regarding suspected Human Trafficking of an adult anywhere in the United States or of a child outside of Florida please contact the National Human Trafficking Resource Center: 1(888) 373-7888.

Visit the National Human Trafficking Hotline online at: https://humantraffickinghotline.org . 5.0 FEES AND COLLECTIONS 5.1 Establishing Appropriate Fees All students must adhere to the charges listed at all times. Any deviation from the listed fees may be challenged and corrected by a faculty member. 5.2 Patient Accounts and Student Collection Policy 1. Patients acceptable for student treatment must have a screening examination before assignment. These patients' accounts are verified with the Business Office or the treatment coordinator prior to assignment to ensure the balance is zero. 2. The student, with support from the treatment coordinator, is responsible for assuring the patient account is either current or treatment discontinued. Differences between student financial records and pati ent accounting reports must be reviewed and verified. Questions or problems concerning patient accounts and/or patient account reports should be directed to the Business Office located in D2-6. 41 3. All balances , regardless of the clinic where the services are rendered, should be collected. This is the responsibility of the treating student dentist. Patients are scheduled with no balance and if they do not pay after the first appointment a balance will develop. The patient should not be rescheduled unless the ba lance is paid prior to the next treatment. All efforts should be exhausted to collect first time balance s, including phone calls and balance letters to the patient. Student dentists are responsible for any balance incurred after the first nonpayment proced ure. (For example: if you have completed scaling and root planing on quadrants I and IV on June 1st and the patient does not pay, and you continue treatment (i.e. more scaling and root planing) you will be responsible for paying all charges since you added to the balance without having the patient pay for the previous balance.) 4. Correct fees and codes ar e in the patient management system. Review with the patient the plan, fees, and payment procedure. Ask the patient to confirm his understanding by printing a copy of the proposed treatment plan. Stress to patients that the fees quoted are estimates only and variations may occur if it becomes necessary to alter the treatment plan. If changes do occur, the patient must sign and be provided with a revised version of the treatment plan. 5. The patient is responsible for paying the appropriate fees for dental care. The student is responsible for collecting patient fees. Make all patient charges and collections on the day of treatment. When treatment is completed, escort the patient to Patient Services (in the lobby). The cashier will accept payment from the patient based on the amount recorded on the gold routing slip/or in the patient management system. a. Under no circumstances can the student accept payment from the patient for dental services performed. If the cashier's office on the first floor is closed, take the patient to the Business Office on the second floor. b. If a patient plans to pay at the next appointment, document this agreement. No patient paying on a \"cash basis\" should be allowed to continue treatment if fees from the last appointment have not been coll ected by the next appointment date. c. Bring patient payment problems or other special circumstances to the immediate attention of the TEAM leader, treatment coordinator, the Business Office, patient advocate or the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs. NOTE : Written approval from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality, or his/her designee must be obtained before agreeing to personally pay for the dental care of a patient. As a general rule, this practice is not condoned. If a case should arise in which a patient requests that a student remunerate the patient for a particular procedure, or request that the student pay for the dental work, the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality should be immediately informed. 6. Charges associated with mul tiple visit procedures (prosthodontics) should be submitted in full when treatment is initiated. This will not affect any payment arrangement established with a patient. 7. Patients will not be formally discharged from responsibility until the account balan ce has been verified as zero, without special approval from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . Before graduation, all patient accounts must be verified as zero. 8. The student is responsible for ensuring that current patient information, including address, phone numbers, and copy of state identification card, is on file for each patient. Any changes should be submitted to the treatment coordinator or the Chart Room f ront desk in Patient Services . 5.3 Third Party Guarantors If a patient is being sponsored by a social service agency or other third party, the student is still responsible for ensuring that payment will be collected. Before beginning treatment on a patie nt with Medicaid, verify the patient's eligibility ( this applies to every visit ). Medicaid has multiple managed care plans, and each is slightly different regarding covered services, pre -authorization requirements, and frequency limitations. The specific p lan should be selected during registration in axiUm and the Business Office will assist with prior authorization approval after treatment needs are determined. Eligibility can be verified online at the Florida Medicaid website , as well as the various Medicaid managed care web sites. If the patient is not eligible, 42 students MUST inform the patient and make other payment arrangements before beginning treatment. Patients may be unaware that they are no longer covered and it is the student dentist's responsibility to verify this. If the pat ient loses coverage mid -treatment, students must make the patient aware. The patient will be responsible for non -covered charges, as long as a Non -Covered Services form is completed and signed by the patient prior to rendering the services. Omitting this s tep may result in the student dentist being responsible for the balance. Assuring eligibility is the student's responsibility at every appointment . If you have any concerns or questions you need to bring them to the attention of the Business Office , (273-5380). 5.4 Insurance The insurances accepted in the pre -doctoral program are Medicaid and the Medicaid managed care plans . Any other insurances are not accepted as a form of payment in the pre -doctoral program. The student is responsible for collecting fees from his/her patients. However, the patient may be assisted in submitting their insurance claim and receiving reimbursem ent from their insurance provider once the services have been paid for in full and completed in axiUm. The patient must bring their insurance company's approved claim form for completion. The patient must complete the patient information section of the for m. The student or patient must bring the form to the Business Office for completion. The Financial Assistance Counselor will complete and mail the form to the insurance company. 5.5 Contract Policy Subject : University of Florida College of Dentistry Title : Policy for Establishing a Financial Contract in the Clinical Care Groups Date: August 18, 2008 Approving Authority : Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality. Custodian : Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality, 273 -6820 Purpose : Financial assistance is needed for many of our patients to continue their treatment in our student clinics. Once a treatment plan is established, many of our patients find themselves unable to afford the lump sum payment for treatment that has been establi shed. This also affects our students and their progression through our clinical curriculum by decreasing the number of patients that will seek treatment. The purpose of this policy is to set up a mechanism for the patient to enter into a financial contract with the University of Florida, College of Dentistry to pay for planned treatment. Policy : The University of Florida, College of Dentistry will offer patients the option to pay for services through a contract establishing a payment plan with an appropria te down payment . Procedure : A. Guidelines to establish a Financial Contract with a Clinical Care Group: Two distinct levels of contracts can be established based on the total cost for the treatment that is planned. 1. When the treatment planned is, or will be, billed from $400.00 - $600.00 dollars: a) At the time the contract is accepted, a minimal down payment of \u00bd of the total amount being billed will be collected. The balance is to be paid in monthly installments. b) The contract will be for a set amount of time n ot to exceed six months. (Minimal payment in this level will be $35.00/month) c) There will be an administrative charge of $50.00 for contracts between $400.00 - $600.00. This fee will be added to the down payment. 2. When the treatment exceeds $600.00 dollars a nd up to a maximum of $3,000.00: a) At the time the contract is accepted, a minimal down payment of 1/3 of the total amount being billed will be collected. The balance will be paid in monthly installments. 43 b) The contract will be for a set amount of time not to exceed 12 months. (Minimal payment in this level will be $50.00/month.) c) There will be an administrative charge of $75.00 for contracts of $601.00 and up. This fee will be added to the down payment. B. To establish a contract, the Budget Payment Form must be c ompleted and approved by a Team Leader. Once approved, the form is sent to the Patient Accounting Office in order for the budget payment to be established in axiUm. 1. Contracts can be renegotiated if the treatment plan changes during the course of treatment. 2. Any treatment provided in a Graduate, Endodontic, Orthodontic, or Oral Surgery clinic will not be covered under the Clinical Care Group contract. These charges must be paid directly to the respective program. No contract will be written if there is an exi sting balance from another clinic. 3. Payments must be current in order for appointments to be scheduled. 4. The payment plan will be considered in default if one monthly payment is missed. The entire balance becomes due and is subject to collection after 120 d ays 5. Other options for paying for treatment charges is via Credit Card (VISA, MasterCard, & American Express). 5.6 TEAMS Payment Contract Process (per the Business Office) 1. Dental student completes the payment contract form, gets it approved in their clinic, and scans the document into axiUm. 2. The same day, the dental student brings the patient to the Business Office (D2 -6) along with a copy of the patient's treatment plan. NOTE: The required down payment must be made before the payment plan can be set up in axiUm. If the patient is paying with cash, they must make the payment at the first floor cashier window before coming to the Business Office. Any other form of payment can be processed by the Business Office staff in D2 -6. 3. The dental student will remain wi th the patient in the Business Office while the Business Office staff verifies that all procedures and correct charge amounts are on the patient's account. a. Any necessary corrections will be communicated to the dental student at this time. 4. After the payment contract has been set up in axiUm by the Business Office staff, the patient will then sign the original Budget Payment Agreement form and the axiUm printed contract. a. The Business Office staff will provide the student with 1 copy of the signed forms to be scanned into the patient chart. b. The Business Office staff will provide the patient with a copy of the signed forms. 5. The patient then pays the appropriate down -payment amount. a. Check and / or Credit Card payments will be processed in the Business Office by the Business Office Staff setting up the payment contract and a receipt will be provided to the patient. b. If the patient is paying by cash, they will be directed to the first floor cashiers accompanied by their dental student to make the appropriate down -payment and receive a receipt. i. Patient will bring their copy of the payment contract to the first floor cashier, along with the appropriate documented down -payment amount to be paid. ii. Cashier will attach the patient's receipt to the patient's copy of the paym ent contract. NOTE : Any / all additional services performed outside of the contracted procedures must be paid in full at the time of service. 44 5.7 Voiding Charges If a procedure/charge is entered in the patient management system that is incorrect for some reason, a faculty member must authorize an adjustment form. The \"ADJST\" form must be initiated in axiUm for an adjustment. All patient visits must generate a treatment code entry in the patient management record whether a fee is charged or not. If th e fee is to be waived, an adjustment form MUST be submitted with a rationale supporting the reason for the adjustment. 5.8 Missing Charges Policy The College of Dentistry has the potential to lose many thousands of dollars in revenue each year if charge s are not properly processed in the patient management system. At any given time, there should be no missing charges over 24 hours in the patient management system . 5.9 Treatment of Fellow Dental Students Dental students are allowed to be treated by ot her dental students for one -half the normal student patient fee except for prosthodontics and implant procedures. For prosthodontic procedures, consult with the chair of the Department of Restorative Dental Sciences and/or division director of prosthodonti cs, regarding the appropriate fee. For castings in operative, consult with the division head of operative dentistry. This provision is strictly for student dentists being treated by student dentists in the teams clinics and does not extend to family member s, dental assistants, Santa Fe College (SFC) dental hygiene students, or SFC dental assisting students, who must pay standard fees. 6.0 GENERAL CLINIC PROTOCOL 6.1 Sterilization UFCD is committed to the highest quality of care and patient safety. All procedures outlined in the Infection Control Document, consistent with UF, state, and federal policies are followed. Students will be instructed in those policies and non -compliance w ill not be tolerated. 1. Central Sterilization is responsible for cleaning, disinfecting, packaging and sterilizing instruments and handpieces from the student leasing program and select post -doctoral clinics. The methods of sterilization utilized at UFCD a re steam autoclaving. All sterilizer units are tested daily using UFCD's in - house biological monitoring service. Additionally, all loads which contain an implantable device are tested utilizing Assert Biological Indicator which provides results within 40 m inutes The test results are logged and records maintained for three years. The UFCD Sterilization Manual is maintained in Central Sterilization. The manual outlines the procedures and policies which ensure the efficacy of processing, sterilizing, transport and storage of all critical items. Students are to check out leased instruments from Central Sterilization in all clinical floors (D1-28; D2 - 44 or D3 -28). 2. Start -check Procedure As part of the start -check procedure in clinics, a faculty member will verify that the instruments to be used have been through a sterilization procedure. To accomplish this, the faculty member must see the unopened package of instruments before the dental procedure is started. 3. Sharps Management 45 NOTE : ALL USED NEEDLES AND SURGICAL BLADES MUST BE DEPOSITED IN SHARP BOXES IN EACH CLINIC OR OPERATORY. FAILURE TO COMPLY will result in counseling and Professional Clinical Variance, leading to a grade reduction in Professionalism. Repeat non -compliance may result in clinic suspe nsion. 6.2 Use of Portable Nitrous Oxide Machines To use a portable nitrous oxide/oxygen machine, the student must have a statement of approval from the attending faculty member responsible for the student and the patient during that period. This statem ent must be in the Treatment Notes and signed by the specific faculty member, who has the required qualifications for the use of nitrous oxide/oxygen. Under NO circumstances may a student leave a patient unsupervised who is under nitrous oxide/oxygen inhal ation. 6.3 Predoctoral Implant Protocol 1. Implant Screening : Screening for dental implant treatment in the student program is done by appointment. If the student identifies a potential implant patient, the student completes an Implant consult Pre -screen form to ensure the patient is disease free and has completed all outstanding treatment which then allows the Treatment Coordinator to schedule the implant consult appointment. Currently, implant consults are available on most Monday through Thursday mornings and Monday s through Wedensday afternoons. Consults are available in three clinics: Center for Implant Dentistry, Graduate Periodontics, and Graduate Prosthodontics . For partially edentulous patients, we are providing posterior tooth replacement (i.e. molar or premolar) only. For edentulous patients, we are providing two -implant mandibular overdentures only. Note: We do not provide care for patients who present with implants placed outside of the Colle ge of Dentistry. These patients must be referred to Graduate Prosthodontics for evaluation for treatment by a prosthodontic resident . 2. Radiographic/Surgical guides : Once the patient is approved for treatment in the student program, the student dentist wil l need to work with the assigned resident to fabricate a conventional or 3D printed surgical guide. The student will need to expose a periapical radiograph (or panoramic) with the radiographic guide which shows the roots of the adjacent teeth prior to fabricating the surgical guide. Alternatively, the surgeon may request a sectional or full arch CBCT in radiology to allow for a CBCT guided surgical template . 3. Surgery Appointments : Once the student dentist has completed the surgical guide, he/she may schedu le the implant surgery. The student dentist should then go to the receptionist of the clinic where the implant consult was completed to make the surgical appointment. The student dentist must plan on being present for the patient's surgery and show the sur gical guide to the surgeon in advance of the appointment. 4. Restorative Appointments : Restoration of implants is completed in the TEAMS clinics, after a suitable healing period, which is usually a minimum of 8 to 12 weeks, as indicated by the surgeon. Once the surgeon has cleared the patient for restorative treatment, the student will contact the Director of Predoctoral Implant Dentistry to order the restorative components at least two weeks prior to the appointment. Implant restorative kits for the Strauman n and Astra implant systems are available through Central Sterilization. Prosthodontic faculty and TEAM leaders are available to supervise the restorative treatment. When removing healing abutments, use a throat pack and tie off any wrenches with dental fl oss prior to their use in the mouth . 5. Additional information : To learn more about the clinical procedures, refer to Canvas for DEN 7411 Overview of Implant Dentistry. In the \"Documents\" section, look for the implant lectures entitled \"7&8 Fixed Rest Option s (implant level) and \"13&14 Treatment of the edentulous patient.\" For additional information on the radiographic and surgical guides, in the \"Documents\" section, look for the implant 46 lectures entitled \"3&4 Guides.\" 6.4 Laboratory Utilization The simulati on lab will be available for all scheduled courses and activities. The simulation lab will be available for scheduled and unscheduled practice as described below. Follow the Simulation Lab Scheduled posted outside the Simulation Laboratory doors. 1. Monday through Friday (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), students may not practice during a scheduled laboratory session. 2. Monday through Friday (8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.), students may practice when no class is scheduled. All students must be out of the lab 15 minutes prio r to any scheduled activity even if it is for their own class. This is to allow cleaning, stocking, and dispensing of materials 3. Course activities or practice sessions with tutors after 5:00 p.m. on weekdays or during the weekends will require scheduling th rough the Office of Academic Affairs . 4. The lab is available for \"walk -in\" practice after hours and on week -ends when not reserved for scheduled activities from 6:00am until11:00 pm. While locked, students will use their ID card and \"swipe\" for entrance. For safety reasons, video cameras will monitor the lab. 5. The lab will be available for UFCD continuing education activities at times that do not conflict with the UFCD curricular requirements. Scheduling of the simulator lab for continuing education activit ies will be coordinated through the Office of Continuing Education, Office of Clinical Administration, and Office of Academic Affairs . The lab must be monitored by an individual trained in simulator usage and maintenance and also skilled in the operation o f the computer technology. 6.5 Student Responsibilities for Simulation Lab Equipment Students are responsible for certain aspects related to the care and function of the assigned simulators. These are described below. Students are assigned to one simulator for their entire pre -clinical curriculum. The student's name will be affixed to the assigned station. Each student will be loaned a numbered key to correspond to his numbered drawer. Misplaced or lost keys should be immediately reported to the education resource manager. The replacement fee is $44.00. 1. White butcher paper should be pla ced on the workbench prior to any lab work. 2. Students are not to use another student's simulator or station for assigned lab sessions or interchange any parts with another simulator unless reassigned by the educational resource manager or faculty, due to ma intenance issues. 3. Students should inspect their simulator and station at the beginning of each lab period to verify that the units are functional and that the torso or other components have not been damaged or defaced. If damage is noted, the student shoul d report this to the attending faculty and educational resource manager. (Refer to section on \"Reporting Damage.\") 4. Students are given a shroud \"rubber face\" for simulator use and are responsible for replacement at their own cost if lost or damaged beyond use. 5. Shrouds are removed, cleansed, dried and locked in the assigned drawer at the close of each session. If replacement becomes necessary, the fee is $80.00. 6. If a student finds any equipment in their unit that does not belong to them, it is to be immedia tely turned in to the educational resource manager or the instrument leasing manager. 6.6 Reporting Damaged Simulator Components If damage is noted, it should be immediately reported to the education resource manager. If the unit is still functional, the s tudent may proceed with the lab exercise after appropriate reporting has been completed. 47 If the unit is not functional or the repairs cannot be made within 10 -15 minutes, the student will be assigned to another unit, preferably an unassigned simulator. Th e problem will be reviewed and the student who previously used the unit will be contacted. Corrective action will be administered when indicated . Students are ethically and financially responsible for damage or defacement of the simulator torso. For afte r-hours emergencies refer to the yellow signs in both labs S3 -15 and D3 -31. Please call , the Facilities Services number for after -hours maintenance emergencies. 6.7 Student Responsibilities for Simulation Lab Maintenance The Simulation Lab will be closed and locked at the scheduled time for the class to end. The following steps must be completed prior to leaving the lab: 1. Stop working 10 -15 minutes before the close of the session to allow ample time to clean the area. 2. Remove the dentoform from the jaw assembly. 3. Remove, clean, dry, and store the face mask in the locked simulator drawer. 4. Clean the simulator torso and jaws with wet paper towels. If necessary, use hand soap and water and rinse well. 5. Do NOT use commercial c leansers, abrasives or solvents on the components. These could cause irreversible damage for which students would be responsible. 6. Clean and dry jaw assembly and place on the simulator base. Turn off the simulator power switch (green), the water pressure v alve (up is off), the bench light, the composite curing light, and the computer monitor and help light. 7. Place the hoses on their proper holder. 8. Fill the water container (white liter jug) with fresh distilled water. 9. If the white collection tank is over 3/4 full, decant the water into the sink drain in the wet lab (D3 -16), making certain the amalgam stays in the trap and does not go down the drain. (Allowing amalgam to go down the drain is a violation of federal hazardous waste disposal regulations.) 10. Leave t he torso in a folded forward position, stored under the bench top. 11. Properly dispose of trash, and remove waste and debris from the bench top. 12. Leave the bench and work area neat, dry, and clean. 13. Push the stool under the bench upon leaving. 14. No student is p ermitted to remove any equipment or material, (i.e.; dentoform jaws and plates, curing lights or any material from the supply table) from the Sim Lab without explicit permission from the educational resource manager, instrument leasing manager, office of e ducation, or clinic administration. 6.8 C ontact Individuals for Assistance For Scheduling Office of Academic Affairs - 273-5950 Continuing Dental Education - 273-8480 For Computer/AV Support AV Equipment Operator (D3 -43) - 273-5711 For Simulator Maintenance Dental Maintenance - 273-8001 6.9 Faculty and Staff Responsibilities for Simulation Lab Maintenance 48 1. Faculty using the lab will be issued keys so they may become more familiar with the computer technology and to allow them to set up lab activities a t their convenience. 2. The lab will be opened at least 10 minutes before scheduled activities. (This will vary with individual faculty preference.) 3. At the beginning of each session, faculty will report any concerns, such as a lack of cleanliness or equipmen t malfunctions. 4. Faculty will conclude the class with 10 -15 minutes remaining to allow students ample time for maintenance procedures. 5. When the educational resource manager is not available at the end of a scheduled course, the last attending faculty to l eave the area will close the door. 6. At the conclusion of each session, the areas will be checked for student compliance with the maintenance protocols. Action regarding non -compliance will be initiated as appropriate and consistent with the severity of the incident. 7. Counseling and suggestions to manage initial acts of non -compliance and promote improvement may be offered by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . 8. Continued violations and/or serious violations with the intent of misleading fac ulty or inflicting intentional damage to equipment may result in a lowered performance evaluation in the category of asepsis, patient management, or professionalism (as appropriate). Variance reports will be submitted as required. 9. In addition, a letter of reprimand from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality will be included in the student's permanent academic file. 6.10 Junior/ Senior Lab Utilization 1. The Junior/Senior lab will be available for authorized users from 7:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. daily (Monday - Sunday), unless reserved for special purposes such as state boards, mock boards, lectures, lab exercises, continuing education, or maintenance work. Advance notice (at least seven workdays) will be given regarding closures and reservations. 2. All efforts will be made to save some sections of the lab for clinical patient care when clinics are scheduled. 3. The lab doors will be locked when unoccupied during evenings, on weekends, and holidays. For security and safety, students and staff are to ca ll UF Security if persons enter the lab without authorization or proper identification. 4. Food and drinks are not allowed in the lab. 5. No clinical procedures can be performed in the clinical lab, D3 -31 (i.e., alginate impressions, face bows). 6. Sound or music s ystems may be used in the laboratory provided their volume, content, and use does not detract from the normal operation of the lab and its surrounding clinics. 7. Scheduling of the lab for continuing education activities will be coordinated through the Clinic al Administration Office, activities will not be allowed to adversely impact patient care. 6.11 Lab Safety The laboratories are considered hazardous work areas. The risk of injury from chemical, gas, heat, electrical sources, air -driven tools and mechani cal equipment in this confined limited space must be understood by everyone. For these reasons, all users must: 1. Know the location of the telephone and emergency numbers in the lab (wall -mounted on the northeast corner, near the double doors). Know the loca tion of fire extinguishers and exit d oors and stairways from the lab 49 2. Know the location of the three emergency eyewash stations in the lab (one on the SE corner next to the single door and two on the model pouring and trimming station in the middle of the lab) 3. Wear eye protection in the lab at all times. 4. Know the location of the First Aid box in the lab (mounted on the second column, next to station number 32). 5. Dispose of broken glass, sharps, and instruments in the sharps container located in the middle of the lab. Large broken glass items must be disposed of separately in a box that is legibly marked \"broken glass\" and placed near trash receptacles. 6. Obtain proper training and instructions from faculty or staff members prior to operating or using any unfami liar or never -used lab equipment. 7. Report any broken equipment, exposed electrical components, loose or missing parts, gas, air, or water leaks to the educational resources manager, leasing manager, dental maintenance (273 -8001) and/or clinic administration . 8. Report any inappropriate behavior or actions by others that could lead to unsafe conditions to attending staff, faculty, or the Office of Academic Affairs . 6.12 Student Dentist Responsibilities for the Clinical Lab Equipment and Stations Student dentists are responsible for certain aspects related to the care and operation of the lab. A degree of pride and ownership is expected from each assigned student so that the laboratory remains in good condition for continuous use. These responsibilities ar e described below: 1. Two student dentists (a Junior and a Senior) are assigned a working station with adjacent storage bins for their tackle boxes. In the event that both students would need to use their assigned station at the same time, a \"first -come, firs t-serve\" rule will be followed, with latecomers expected to use another station that may be vacant at that time. Staff members may move students to other stations at any time as various situations warrant. 2. Prior to working at their stations, students must lay down brown paper on the counter to prevent dirt and debris from accumulating on the workstations . In case of spills, splatters, wax, or acrylic deposits on workstation surfaces, students must wipe, scrape, or remove such deposits immediately to avoid build-up. 3. Each student dentist is responsible for collecting and depositing trash that he has generated in trash containers located throughout the lab. 4. Student dentists must know the proper care, operation, use, and settings of lab equipment. Contact the at tending faculty or staff member for instructions and guidance prior to operating any equipment. Lab equipment is to be used for specified laboratory procedures only. Improper use could render the equipment unsafe for the next user. Use of lab equipment oth er than for its intended purposes constitutes misuse of state property and may result in follow -up disciplinary sanctions. 5. All lab equipment is to remain in D3 -31. 6. When using gas or alcohol burners, ensure sufficient distance is maintained from nearby item s to prevent accidental melting or burning. Do not place burners directly underneath lamps, shelves, or hoses. 7. Seal or cap all containers that could spill or leak fumes or chemicals in the air or working surfaces. To ensure efficient vacuum operation at st udent workstations, avoid suctioning moisture or moist items into suction units. 8. Casts and prosthesis must be dried prior to grinding or trimming with suction vents on. 9. Clean suction vents and shields after grinding or trimming. 10. Report occasions when \"C heck filter\" indicator light comes on to the staff member or make an entry in the Repair Log. 11. Prior to leaving the lab, students must follow the checklist below. Make sure: a. All lathes, desk lamps, burners, and other equipment have been turned off. 50 b. Gas and air valves are closed. c. Equipment and parts are returned or mounted in their original positions. d. Chairs are rolled back into their respective stations. e. Tackle boxes are locked and stored only in your assigned stations. No personal equipment or items are allowed on shelves, drawers, counters, and floors. f. If the collection drawer was used, all debris must be removed and drawers must be wiped clean. g. All work station trash is collected and deposited in trash containers located throughout the lab. 6.13 Laboratory Infection Control In consonance with the Infection Control Document procedures outlined under Section 9.0 of this Manual, the following guidelines will be followed when working on prostheses that come from patient care clinics: 1. Polishing or the use of pumice and polishing compounds is not allowed in D3 -31. 2. To polish prostheses, use the Polishing Lab in the predoctoral teams clinics and follow protocol. Since the Polishing Lab is open only during clinic hours, students must plan on polishing their prosthesis according to these hours. 3. Upon entering D3 -31 with disinfected prosthesis, always wear full P.P.E. protection before doing any laboratory procedure. P.P.E. supplies are located within the student dentist's team clinic. 4. Rinse prosthesis again pr ior to performing any procedure. Dispose of transfer bag(s) and exposed paper towels in trash containers. 5. Disinfect all instruments with approved surface disinfectant prior to leaving the pouring station. 6. Dispose of gloves, masks, and gowns in trash containers. 7. Follow other laboratory disinfection and decontamination procedures outlined in Section 9.0 Infection Control. 6.14 Supervision of Maintenance and Cleanliness of Student Laboratories Student dentists are responsible for cleaning and maintaini ng the Junior/Senior Student Laboratory (D3 -31). The activity will be supervised by UFCD staff designated by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . If the laboratories are not properly cleaned and maintained, the responsible students will be suspended from the clinics for up to one week. Failure to maintain the third floor clinical laboratory properly can also result in the closure of this laboratory to student use for any period of time deemed proper by the administration. To keep the labora tories in the best usable condition, each person must exercise a professional \"clean as you go\" practice as they work in the Lab. 6.15 Student Responsibilities for Polishing Laboratory (in the TEAM clinics) Wear gown, mask, eye protection (student's own), and gloves before working in the Polishing Laboratory. Ensure every prosthesis has been properly decontaminated prior to entering the lab. To minimize cross contamination, keep each case in a separate seale d denture bag or cup issued by Clinical Staff dental assistants. Collect polishing supplies and material prior to opening the bag containing the prosthesis. The use of a unit dose system is mandatory to minimize cross -contamination and waste. 1. Cover the bl ack rubber polishing tray with a clear plastic bag before polishing. 2. Open and lay down supplies on the foam tray to avoid touching other items when polishing. 3. If using an ultrasonic cleaner, place the prosthesis in a separate re -sealable bag using approp riate cleaning solution before placing it in the ultrasonic tray. 4. Refer to posted charts on the wall for the correct cleaning solutions and time settings. 5. Allow sufficient vibrating time prior to removing the bag, and dispose of the cleaning solution imm ediately in the sink. 6. Dispose of the bag immediately in the trash receptacle . 51 7. When finished with the polishing, collect all used material and dispose as follows: Place the prosthesis in a new zip -lock bag and seal it tight. Spray approved disinfectant on the sealed bag, all countertops, and equipment surfaces used during polishing. Wipe with paper towels. Spray the approved disinfectant again; leave the second spray to dry (\" Wipe -Discard -Wipe \"). De -glove and wash hands prior to using marking supplies. Repo rt any equipment needing repair or servicing on the maintenance sheet posted on the wall or to the designated staff. Write down needed supplies on the supply request form next to the maintenance sheet. 6.16 Faculty and Staff Responsibilities for D3 -31 Faculty will inform the staff responsible for the laboratories of the scheduled courses and lab exams requiring special needs. Faculty will conclude the class with 10 minutes remaining to allow students ample time for clean -up procedures. Faculty will remin d students to clean their areas before leaving the lab. 6.17 Checklist for Clinic Maintenance 1. Operatories (Expectations after use of clinic operatory) a. Counters and sinks should be clean. b. Cabinet fronts should be clean c. Operator's chair, dental assistant's chair, and the dental chair should be clean. d. No calendars or cartoons should be pasted on walls. e. Suction tips should be removed from the unit. f. Saliva ejector tubing should be in place on the unit, without the disposable tip. Tubing should be free of debri s. g. Trash bag should be deposited in clinic trash. h. Place individual small red bag containing any regulated waste (blood or saliva soaked gauze or cotton rolls) into the \"red bag\" trash. i. Paper towels should be in the dispenser. j. Only approved hand soap, hand sanitizer, and surface disinfectant is permitted near sink area. 2. General a. Instrument trays, laboratory trays, and other equipment and supplies checked out or borrowed from sterilization must be returned at the end of each clinic session. b. No linens, magazin es, or other materials should be on the tops of the walls separating the cubicles. c. The oxygen tanks and masks are checked daily and replenished as needed. d. Emergency kit locks are checked daily. Emergency kit supplies are replaced immediately if used, or replenished when expired. 3. Maintenance To ensure the saliva ejector and high volume evacuator (HVE) systems are properly maintained and continue to operate with maximum efficiency, the following care and maintenance shall be performed as indicated: a. After each patient , suction hoses (saliva ejector and HVE) shall have a cup of water drawn through each line that requires their use. After the water rinse, draw air through the system for a few seconds to clear water from the tubing (student responsibility). b. At least once each week , but more often if required by usage, all vacuum hoses (saliva ejector and HVE) shall be cleaned, deodorized, and sanitized by suctioning a quart of cleaner (i.e., OR - EVAC from Henry Schein Dental Supplies or PUREVAK from Sultan) prepar ed according to the manufacturer's instructions, through each hose (dental assistant responsibility). c. Each week , disposable solid traps shall be replaced. The proper protocol is to be followed for the disposal of the used trap. If suction is weak after the trap replacement, contact Dental Maintenance for assistance. (dental assistant responsibility) 52 6.18 Handpiece Maintenance and Sterilization Handpieces are among the most frequently used instruments in the dental operatory, thus making them highly susc eptible to viral and bacterial contamination. Handpieces represent a considerable economic investment, and because they contain delicate parts and are used from patient -to-patient, handpieces have been described as the \"weak link\" in infection control. Air /turbine handpieces and electric handpieces leased by students are maintained and sterilized by Central Sterilization. All users should follow the sterilization guidelines found in this document for proper management of handpiece sterility. Laboratory hand pieces must be maintained by the student and oiled after each use as recommended by the manufacturer. 6.19 Dental Maintenance Service Request The procedure for reporting maintenance problems on all dental operating equipment is as follows: 1. Each clinical area has a clipboard with a Maintenance Request log sheet. If any item requires maintenance, list it on the log sheet. Maintenance personnel check this sheet daily and make the necessary repairs. 2. Report emergency maintenance requests by telephone (273 -8001) or email ( DN- Maint@dental.ufl.edu ). 3. Any mechanical defect noted in an operatory must be reported to maintenance the same day, whether or not it is your assigned operatory. 4. Report any major physical maintena nce problem immediately to the dental maintenance supervisor (273 -8001) for correction. 6.20 Dress Code Professional Attire (students, faculty and staff): Link to Student Handbook All faculty members staff, and students must wear casual business attire or college -approved scrub top with dress slacks, or a scrub top and bottom. Shorts and denim jean slacks are unacceptable attire. Students may wear a standard short/medium white clinic coat over the scrubs when not providing patient care . Clinic jackets or lab coats are to be worn buttoned, clean and unstained at all times and should be changed as frequently as necessary to maintain cleanliness. Wearing a clean white lab coat over scrubs while outside the preclinical or clinical area, such as going to the cafeteria, dining facilities, or patient reception areas, is encouraged. While working chairside in the clinics, faculty and students are required to wear the appropriate PPE, including a cover gown (which should replace the white lab coat in this event), when aerosol, splatter, or spray may be anticipated. In the Simulation Lab, or while in any clinic performing pre - clinical procedures, protective eyewear is re quired. Skirts and dresses are not allowed in the clinical setting as proper ergonomics cannot be effectively achieved, and bare skin may be exposed to aerosol, splatter, or spray. An exception for skirts can be made for religious purposes, provided infection prevention and safety protocols are maintained. Shorts, divided short skirts, capris, and denim jean slacks are unacceptable attire. Plain or printed T -shirts will not be an ac ceptable substitute for a dress shirt or blouse . Dress shirts or b louses must be designed to preclude inappropriate chest or cleavage exposure during procedures. Professional students must wear properly fitting garments and maintain seams and hems approp riately. For example, by the fourth year, the seam may become stressed and expose skin, or the hem may become frayed and present a less than professional appearance. In addition, frayed hems increases the possibility of 53 accidently tripping on the garment. Be aware of the fit of garment s when positioned in operator and assisting stools, maintain coverage of skin a nd do not expose undergarments. Shoes must be clean and in good repair. Appropriate business shoes would be expected with business attire. Clean athletic or health care professional shoes of vinyl or leather are acceptable with scrubs. To avoid occupational exposures, solid and closed toed shoes are required. Shoes must cover the top portion of the foot when in the clinic setting. However, work boot s or hiking boots are inappropriate footwear. Open -toe shoes, thongs, sandals or \"crocs\" with holes and no heel closure are unacceptable attire. Everyone should wear appropriate socks so legs are covered by scrubs or socks during seated clinical procedures Baseball caps and similar athletic headwear are inappropriate attire. Exceptions are made if the attire is for medical reasons, such as chemotherapy. Personal Hygiene: Dental professionals work in close proximity to the patient's face and hence must main tain awareness of how personal hygiene affects the patient experience. Use of strong fragrances such as perfumes, colognes and perfumed body lotions should be avoided when scheduled to care for patients. We enjoy living in a sub - tropical climate, but we n eed to remain mindful of the effects of this weather on our bodies, and be prepared to minimize its effects upon arrival to clinic. Likewise, consumption of some foods and spices may produce strong body odors and must be avoided prior to providing care to patients. Additionally, professional attire must be clean, tidy and odor free. Daily maintenance of personal hygiene combined with the u se of commercially available fragrance free and odor reducing laundry detergents is recommended to help the dental pro fessional practice patient centered care . Hand -Hygiene: Fingernails must be kept short, clean and neatly trimmed. Fingernail polish, artificial nails (acrylic or gel) and hand jewelry may harbor pathogens and are not acceptable when delivering patient c are. Providers should report breaks in skin (hands) that may affect the safety of the healthcare provider or patient. Hands must be effectively washed at the start and end of each patient care session. Use of hand sanitizer between hand washing is permitt ed so long as there is no visible debris on the hands. Hand hygiene 54 procedures are to be performed before donning gloves for patient care, and immediately after removing gloves following patient care. Hair Maintenance: Hair must be neatly groomed at all times. In the clinical setting, hair should not touch the patient during procedures, nor should it fall in the field of the operator. Hair should be tightly secured, and/or contained in a head covering . During patient ca re facial hair must be contained by appropriate face covering . When wearing a surgical N95 face covering, p lease refer to the guidelines for additional information regarding facial hair and use of filtering facepiece respirators: Facial Hairstyles and Filtering Facepiece Respirators (cdc.gov) 1910.134 - Respiratory protection. | Occupational Safety and Health Administration (osha.gov) Clinic Scrubs Policy: This policy allows students the option of wearing full scrubs along with the existing dress code options with the following guidelines: 1. The scrubs will be ceil blue in color (top and bottom) for all of the pre -doctoral classes. No other color of top or bottom is permitted for pre -doctoral students, with the exception of hospital call rotations. 2. The cost of scrubs is the responsibility of the student. 3. When outside clinical trea tment areas, a white lab jacket may be worn over the scrubs. This includes the Communicore, COD hallways, and all dining areas. 4. Scrubs are considered as \"street clothes\" and are to be laundered by the student as regular clothing. They should be clean, nea t, and well maintained. Scrub tops can be worn untucked but torso and undergarments may not be exposed (for example, when chairside). 5. For any aerosol or splatter -producing procedure in patient care clinics, a disposable or washable covergown must be worn i n addition to the scrub or business attire. The covergown will be disposed/discarded of at the end of each clinic session. The professional white lab coat is not permitted to be worn during procedures involving aerosol, splatter, or spray, unless it is und erneath a covergown. 6. For aerosol or splatter -producing procedures involving non -sterile, but disinfected extracted teeth in the simulation exercises, a covergown is required. 7. For aerosol or splatter -producing procedures involving plastic dentoform teeth in the simulation exercises, a covergown is optional. 8. For reasons of modesty and/or warmth, solid white (short - or long - sleeved) T -shirts may be worn under the scrub top. This practice is encouraged if inappropriate exposure of the chest area is in question . White T -shirts must be tucked in at the waist. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE): The purpose of the personal protective equipment listed below is to protect skin, eyes, nose, and mouth from any possible splashes, spray, spatter, or droplets of blood o r saliva produced during simulation exercises or patient contact or treatment. The final decision as to the protective equipment required rests with Infection prevention and safety subcommittee in accordance with Florida Statutes, CDC, and OSHA requirements. OSHA Rule 29 CFR 1910.1030 http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=ST ANDARDS&p_id=10051 Guidance as to protective equipment (PPE) usage is also available from the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality , the Department Chair, and the Clinical Affairs Committee. Instructions for the proper donning and removal of PPE are available in Appendix L . NOTE: Food and drink are not allowed in the simulation lab, clinics, or clinical labs . 1. General: 55 a. Fingernails shall be kept short and well groomed. Acrylic nails and nail polish harbor pathogens and are not allowed during t he provision of clinical care. b. Hand or wrist jewelry should be removed prior to hand hygiene and donning the protective cover gown and gloves. c. Hair must be neatly groomed at all times. In the clinical setting, hair should not touch the patient during procedures, nor should it fall in the field of vision of the operator.

Gloves shall be removed and hand hygiene must be performed prior to handling paper documents (for example: patient walk -out forms, or patient educational materials) f. Upon leaving the patient care operatory , gloves are to be removed and hand hygiene must be performed. 4. Eyewear: a. Protective eyewear must be worn by students, faculty, staff, and patients for any patient contact or procedure which could result in exposure to patient blood or saliva. b. Eyewear in the form of glasses or goggles must have solid side shields. Prescription eyeglasses are acceptable only if they include solid side shields. c. Chin length face shields may be substituted for glasses or goggles, and must be worn along with a surgical mask (or surgical N95 respirator ) d. Eyewear shall be disinfected between patients following the guidelines and materials detailed in the Infection Control Document and in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. 5. Masks: Interim guidance for the COVID19 pandemic (Protocol when the region is considered \"High Risk\") : a. During patient care, a disposable surgical filtering facepiece respirator such as a surgical N95 respirator must be worn. Alternative respirators may be considered on a case by case standard and in accordance with university policy and procedure through the office of Environmental 56 Health & Safety. b. Surgical N95 must be worn when the operator or assistant is wearing a face shield for eye - protection. c. Surgical N95 must be changed if clinician is unable to achieve a tight seal during the seal check when donning the respirator, or if it become s torn, saturated with operator saliva, or otherwise contaminated. d. Surgical masks are to be worn whe never the clinician is in the clinic al floor setting (At a minimum, floors 1 -3, and all of the first floor of the academic health center) e. Surgical masks must fully cover from the bridge of the nose down under the chin. 6. Persons passing through clinics during clinics hours are required to don clinic attire and use proper PPE. This is not required when clinics do not operate and no patient treatment is rendered. 7. A translator or necessary adjunct individual, who remains in the operatory during a procedure, mu st don the appropriate PPE. Identification Badges/ Nametags : 1. Students, faculty, and staff are required to wear their UF picture ID's at all times. 2.

Reduction in \"professionalism\" portion of clinical assessment 5. Dismissal from clinic by the attending faculty or department chair 6. Counseling by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality for repeated non -compliance. 7. Suspension from clinical activities for a period to be determined by the appropriate faculty in conjunction with the Associate Dean for Cli nical Affairs and Quality . Students should use discretion and present a professional image. If uncertainty exists, the lecturer, or attending clinical faculty should be consulted. 7.0 GUIDELINES AND POLICY REGARDING THE USE OF IONIZING RADIATION 7.1 Introduction The following guidelines and policy regarding the use of ionizing radiation are to insure maximum radiologic yield of benefit to both the patient and diagnostician while reducing to a minimum the potential risk to the operator (faculty, students, and staff), patient and/or non -occupational personnel in adjoining areas. 7.2 General Policy Statement This document is prepared in compliance with National Council on Radiation Protection, NCRP Report No.177 \"Radiation Protection in Den tistry and Oral and Maxillofacial Imaging\" (2019), and U.S. Food and Drug Administration Selection Criteria for dental radiographs, 2012, Federal Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1969, and the Consumer -Patient Radiation Health and Safet y Act of 1981. 57 The policy of the University of Florida College of Dentistry regarding the use of ionizing radiation will be that endorsed by the American Dental Association, American Dental Education Association, American Academy of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, Amer ican Board of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology, the National Center for Devices and Radiological Health (NCDRH), and the State of Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, Office of Radiation Control. The College of Dentistry will therefore adopt and disseminate any policy changes these organizations may initiate in the future. The College of Dentistry adheres to the philosophy that every effort should be made to keep the dose to all individuals As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA). If procedures are done that require exceeding ALARA recommendation, sufficient justification must be provided that needs to be approved prior to the procedure by the attending radiologist. 7.3 Radiation Safety Program Responsibility The Director of the Divis ion of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology is responsible for UFCD policy development and oversight. This includes responsibility for the proper adherence to ADA/FDA patient selection criteria protocol, monitoring the use of ionizing radiation, equipment sele ction, purchase and calibration, annual inspections, and technical quality assurance. The Director serves as a consultant to all departments and communicates policy and compliance requirements to department chairs. The Director and University Radiation Con trol have oversight authority for radiation safety compliance in the central radiology area and in all clinical areas outside central radiology where ionizing radiation is used. 7.4 Training/Certification Students are trained in the safe use of ionizing radiation via didactic and clinical courses, experiences and one competency conducted by the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. (Refer to the Clinical Courses Syllabus for detailed course descriptions of DEN 7762L: Clinical Radiography - Radiogr aphic Technique and Interpretation.) On- the-job-trained dental assisting staff who wish to expose digital sensors are required to take a 1.5 day state mandated training course to expose films and digital sensors, which includes information on the safe use of ionizing radiation. Dental hygienists and certified dental assistants are qualified by virtue of their training. Diplomas and certificates of completion are kept on file in the Quality Assurance Office. 7.5 Physical Facilities 1. All existing radiographic facilities and equipment which are used for patients, or for any experimental or research application, must comply with all federal, state University and College regulations. 2. Radiographic facilities shall be designed or modified to provide student/operator/patient protection from unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. 3. No facilities or equipment used for the production of ionizing radiation shall be constructed, removed or altered without first notifying the Division of Environmental Hea lth and Safety, Department of Radiation Control and Radiological Services (Radiation Control), and faculty in the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology (Radiology). No x -ray equipment shall be purchased, obtained, installed or used in The College wi thout approval from Radiology and Radiation Control and the Radiation Safety Officer . 4. A complete inventory of all x -ray generators within the College of Dentistry will be kept on file in Radiation Control and in Radiology. 5. All x -ray generators will be annually registered with the State of Florida, Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, as administered by the Department of Radiation Control and Radiological Services. All UFCD generators will be annually inspected. The State of Florida will ins pect all generators every five years as per state law. 58 6. Digital sensors shall be monitored daily for defects, replaced if defective and cleaned once a month. Computer monitors shall be accessed for defects/functionality by Information Technology every six months. QA tests are performed using a QA phantom on all size 1 and size 2 sensors twice a year to evaluate contrast, spatial resolution, dynamic range, latitude and delamination defects. 7.6 Criteria for Radiographic Exposure The following criteria will be required throughout the College of Dentistry: 1. All patients will be clinically examined and their medical and dental histories obtained prior to diagnostic radiation exposure. A faculty member (dentist) will prescribe the appropriate radiographs uti lizing the ADA/FDA Guidelines for Patient Selection Criteria. 2. College of Dentistry patients will have appropriate x -ray examinations made based on the ADA/FDA's \"The Selection of Patients for Dental Radiographic Examinations,\" Revision 2004, and NCRP Report No. 145, \"Radiation Protection in Dentistry\", 2003. New patients to the College will be encouraged to bring any recent x -rays, duplicates, or digital image CDs with them during their first visit. 3. The needs of each patient for diagnosis will determin e the frequency of x -ray examinations and not the period of time elapsed since the last visit. 4. Digital sensors must be dispensed to students. Boxes PSP sensors or CCD/CMOS sensors will not be left out for students' unauthorized use. Sensors will not be dispensed to students unless radiographs are ordered in axiUm by attending faculty. Faculty computer entry will certify that requested images are appropriate for the diagnostic need(s) being addressed. 5. Students may re -make a radiograph once after consult ing with faculty or trained staff. If additional remakes are needed, however, they must be performed under direct supervision of faculty or trained staff. 7.7 Pregnant Patients Primarily for reduction of potential anxiety, elective radiography on pregnant patients at the College of Dentistry is recommended to be delayed until after at least the first trimester. Emergency radiographs are recommended when the dental risk to the patient outweighs the health and psychological benefit of waiting. Appr opriate radiographs should be made as needed to diagnose an oral emergency problem. As a general rule until 1987, elective exposures of pregnant women to routine x -ray examinations, particularly in the first trimester, were postponed until after delivery. In 1987, the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (FDA) concluded that arbitrarily avoiding elective dental radiography was not necessary. The concept of avoiding radiography during pregnancy generally applies to procedures in which a fetus or embryo would be in or near the primary x -ray beam (as in some medical procedures). For dental radiography, the primary beam is limited to the head and neck region. Generally, the only radiation that a fetus or embryo could be exposed to is secondary radiation. Uterine doses for full -mouth intraoral radiography have been shown to be less than 1[\u00b5Sv] (without a leaded apron). On the other hand, the uterine dose from naturally occurring background radiation during the 9 months of pregnancy can be expected to be abo ut 75 mrem in view of average background doses on the order of 100 mrem per year. Accordingly, there appears to be no rationale to preclude a properly justified dental radiographic examination because of pregnancy. In embryo cases radiography may be arbit rarily deferred during pregnancy for purely psychological reasons (FDA Pub. No 88 -8273). 59 Additionally, NCRP Report No. 1177 , page 15, B2.2: Exposure to the Embryo and Fetus in Dental X -Ray Procedures: \"Radiation exposures in utero or to children pose a greater risk of stochastic effect than a comparable exposure in adults. However, given the extremely low in utero doses for most dental diagnostic imaging examinations (e.g., 0.009 to 6.9 \u00b5Gy for a full -mouth examination) compared to ~2.25 mGy from natural background during the nine -month gestation, the risk to the developing embryo or fetus is negligible.\" 7.8 Administrative Radiography Administrative radiographs will not be acquired. These radiographs include those authorized or required by a third par ty for reasons other than diagnosis, treatment planning, or preventive services. Administrative radiographs are generally unrelated to professional problem solving, to specific oral and dental treatment needs, or to preventive needs of patients. Thus admin istrative radiographs often result in unnecessary exposure of patients to ionizing radiation as they do not provide a direct health care benefit to the patient. NCRP Report No. 177, page 39, 4.44.1.3 : \"Administrative use of radiation to provide information that is not necessary for the treatment or diagnosis of the patient shall not be permitted. Students or candidates for licensure shall not be compelled or permitted to perform radiographic exposures of humans solely for purposes of education, licensure, c redentialing or other certification.\" In accessing the use of administrative radiographs, attention must be directed to guard against the exclusive use of radiographs for the following purposes: 1. Requirements of third -party carriers: To monitor or to verif y reimbursement claims for treatment. 2. Requirements of Dental Specialty Boards: To provide comprehensive and complete documentation of cases treated, including periodic radiographic examination(s) obtained during the course of treatment , which exceed diagno stic/treatment needs of the patient . 3. Providing training and clinical experiences: Requirements for a specific number of radiographic examinations to ensure the competence of students regardless of the need of the individual patient for such examinations. 4. Certifying competence: Each student must be competent in the use of ionizing radiation prior to graduation as outlined in DEN 7762L . 5. Academic reasons: Repeat radiographic exposures must not be obtained for the exclusive purpose of demonstrating technical co mpetence. Patients must not be exposed solely for the purpose of obtaining radiographs that are technically acceptable or perfect if other radiographs cover the area in question adequately and acceptably. \"Routine examinations\" will not be used on new pat ients to determine their acceptability as a patient , but will be decided on an individual basis . 6. Radiographic examinations must not be used routinely for the purpose of checking the adequacy of restorative, extraction, orthodontic or other procedures when clinical observations alone will suffice. Post -treatment radiographs are a necessary part of endodontic therapy , implant placement and restoration, and follow -up of treatment as dictated by need . 7. Exposure to ionizing radiation must not be used solely to d evelop or maintain departmental case records, to serve as a means for developing visual aids for teaching purposes or to conduct case studies. If patients are to be exposed to ionizing radiation for research purposes, or for clinical studies, the study has to be approved by the \"University's Human Use of Radioisotopes and Radiation Committee.\" 7.9 Radiation Protection Radiation exposure data is available in the patient's electronic health record. Calculation of effective dose is possible if required, using information contained therein that includes the clinic where exposure was made, 60 equipment used, exposure parameters , number of exposures, including remakes, collimation employed, sensor used and any patient related factors. Intraoral and extraoral exposures of patients do not mandate the use of a lead apron when appropriate radiation protection guidelines are followe d, unless it is a pediatric patient up to 18yrs of age, or an expectant mother. Appropriate protection using lead aprons while acquiring cone beam CT studies. In addition, for cone beam CT procedures, it is imperative that lower -dose protocols programmed in the units by patient size and gender must be carefully selected to reduce the field of view, and employ exposure parameters that do not compromise image quality while lowering dose significantly. NCRP Report No. 177, pages 43 -44, 4.4.5 : \"Radiation prot ective aprons for patients were first recommended in dentistry many years ago when dental x -ray equipment was much less sophisticated, image receptors were much slower than under current standards, and the primary risks were thought to be heritable effects . They provided protection in an era of poorly collimated and unfiltered dental x -ray beams. Gonadal (or wholebody) doses from these early full -mouth examinations, reported as high as 50 mGy (Budowsky et al., 1956), could be reduced substantially by radiat ion protective aprons. Gonadal doses from current panoramic or full -mouth intraoral examinations using state -of-the art technology and procedures do not exceed 5 Gy (White, 1992). A substantial portion of this gonadal dose results from internal scattered radiation arising within the patient's head and body. Technological and procedural improvements have eliminated the requirement for the radiation protective apron, provided all other recommendations of this Report are rigorously followed, unless required b y state regulation. However, some patients have come to expect the apron and may request that it be used.. Thyroid shielding shall be provided for patients when it will not interfere with the examination.\" Patient protection will be used in accordance with NCRP Report No. 177 recommendations. All exposures will be performed using the posted appropriate kVp, mA, and time settings Digital images should be obtained utilizing the manufacturer's recommendations whereby the highest signal -to-noise ratio is achiev ed with the optimum contrast resolution. Users of x -ray generating equipment will follow good radiation hygiene practices. During exposures, users will stand in appropriate safe areas, will not hold sensors for patients, and will observe patients so that n o unnecessary remakes occur as the result of tube, film, or patient movement. All radiology faculty, x -ray technicians and other departments' faculty and staff who routinely use ionizing radiation (>3 exposures per week) will wear radiation monitors that a re provided by the Department of Radiation Control and Radiological Services. This department will maintain personnel records of exposure and will act accordingly if excessive exposure levels occur. All supporting technical staff shall be certified in the State of Florida to use x -ray equipment. Radiology faculty should possess appropriate education in oral and maxillofacial radiology. Students shall be closely supervised by faculty or staff during all clinical radiographic procedures conducted on patien ts. Students shall not make radiographs on patients until they have shown competency in the pre -clinical course in radiology. All College of Dentistry x -ray generators will be annually tested by the Department of Radiation Control and Radiological Service s and every five years by the State of Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services, Office of Radiation Control. These surveys will be kept on record in Radiology and in Radiation Control. Evaluations will include beam quality, geometry, expo sure rates, and output. Each department in the College of Dentistry will receive approval from Radiology and Radiation Control and the radiation safety officer prior to the purchase or relocation of equipment. X-ray beams for intraoral generators will be collimated to the smallest diameter (not greater than 2.75 inches in diameter) compatible with the techniques used. Long target -to- receptor distances (at least 8 inches; long \"cone\" technique using 12 -16 inch target -to-film distances is preferable) are t o be utilized when possible. Extraoral x -ray generators should be collimated so the beam size does not exceed the film by more than 2%. Minimum total filtration shall not be less than 1.5 mm aluminum equivalent for beams produced below 70 kVp, and 2.5 mm aluminum equivalent for beams above 70 kVp. Use of rectangular collimation will be employed for intraoral radiographic procedures with the exception of occlusal radiographs using #4 size sensor. 61 All lead aprons and cervical shields must be visually inspe cted annually for cracks or defects and the results reported to Radiology. Aprons and shields will not be folded but rather hung or draped when not in use. These will be checked by the Quality Assurance Division. Departments will be notified if defective protective equipment is found that requires replacement. Ultimately, the use of ionizing radiation should directly benefit patients. Its judicious use as a diagnostic tool is invaluable. This policy statement is designed to put the proper use of ionizing radiation into perspective. Itis the responsibility of the Division of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. Radiology will monitor the use of ionizing radiation, ensure equipment is properly calibrated and tested, and provide technical consultation and assistance to all departments where appropriate. 7.10 Radiology Clinic Protocol Because of potential problems associated with the misuse of ionizing radiation in diagnostic services, the following procedures will be employed for x radiation used for dental r adiographs. Universal compliance is expected. 7.11 Ordering Radiographs 1. A clinical exam of oral tissues must be performed prior to any initial baseline radiographs (new patients). A health history must be completed, reviewed and signed by faculty prior to exposing any radiographs on new predoctoral patients. An updated signed health history will be necessary for all other patients of record. A radiographic request form (RADREQ in axiUm) must be initiated in axiUm using the forms tab in the patient electronic health record. 2. Radiographs are to be ordered based solely on diagnostic need. The expected information that will be gained from ordered radiographs must be expe cted to affect the patient's treatment plan. Ordering radiographs based solely on time intervals is not considered a diagnostic need. NCRP Report No. 177, page 38: \"Maintenance of oral health may require radiographs in asymptomatic new patients or those re turning for periodic reexamination without clear signs and symptoms of oral disease. Selection criteria that aid the dentist in selecting and prescribing radiographic examination of these patients have been published (ADA/FDA, 2004; 2012). These criteria r ecommend that dental radiographs be prescribed only when the patient's history and physical findings suggest a reasonable expectation that radiographic examination will produce clinically useful information.\" 7.12 Operatory Preparation 1. After being dispensed sensors, the operator should identify an x-ray operatory for use. Before seating a patient, the operator should first cover (plastic bag and stick -on plastic sheets) all surfaces, knobs, and buttons as described by the Infection Control Policy. A n excerpt from this document pertaining to radiology is included in this section.* Supplies are available on a cart in the hallway. 2. Collect any instruments, cotton rolls, etc., that will be necessary for the procedure. Place them on a patient napkin. In struments should never come in direct contact with a counter surface. 3. Place a large plastic utility bag over both the headrest, chair back, and chair controls as a barrier. 4. Seat the patient and offer the patient the use of an apron. If elected, plac e the lead apron on the lap and chest. Utilize a thyroid collar when appropriate (18 years of age or less). This is particularly important in the Pediatric Dentistry Clinic. Lead aprons should be offered to all patients. They are recommended, not required, as stated in this document. 5. If using the XDR sensors, place the sensors in protective covers. 6. Use appropriate barrier techniques and personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and masks (as needed), during radiography procedures. 62 7. Begin the pr ocedure. PSP sensors should be dried with a paper towel and collected in a \"dirty\" paper/plastic cup. The outer surface of the collection cup should not be touched by gloved contaminated hands. Sensors, exposed or unexposed, should never be placed in an operator's pocket. 8. Remove the protective covers from the sensors with gloved hands. The XDR sensors and cords need to be wiped with disinfectant. 9. After exposing sensors, return the patient to the waiting area. Before going to the darkroom or the digital scanning area with exposed sensors, the instruments and any uncovered operatory surfaces or controls should be cleaned/disinfected as outlined in the Infection Control Policy. 10. During exposures, radiology personnel will stand behind shielded walls or doors, will not hold the sensors for patients, and will observe patients through the glass shields 7.13 Processing See the Infection Control Policy for additional guidance on film development protocol. 1. PSP Plates : Before going to the scanning area with exposed sensors, the black plastic over -wraps should be removed carefully in the darkened operatory , being careful not to contaminate the sensors with either saliva or white light. Sensors are placed in a carry box and then transported to the scanners wher e they are handled by bare hands for final processing, mounting, and archiving. 2. For CMOS or CCD based sensors , a sealed, disposable sleeve must be used for each patient, taking care to inspect it for tears between exposures. This will then be removed post image acquisition. 7.14 Recording of Exposures After exposure(s), the x -ray unit operator will note any changes in the prescribed technique or number of images acquired in the electronic patient record as applicable. The operator should also indicate the date the images were exposed. Note that the radiology prescription form captures all of this information and can be closed by the operator post image acquisition, once such notes are entered and approved by the attending faculty or radiology certified sta ff. No images may be deleted from the patient record. With the exception of sensors exposed for endodontic therapy, the radiology procedure information will be maintained in the patient records (including Santa Fe Hygiene Program) in the manner described a bove. Endodontic faculty will record each exposure made during the course of endodontic therapy of a specific tooth. When therapy is completed, a total radiation exposure history for that tooth may be entered as one item in the patient's chart, especiall y if several remakes are made or excessive images are acquired for purposes of completing treatment, with appropriate justification. No images may be deleted. 7.15 Remakes 1. All requests for remakes of original exposures must be approved by radiology faculty or radiology staff in central radiology and/or by attending faculty in predoctoral clinics. Remakes are not to be made until the student identifies the error(s) on the original exposure and what steps will be taken to correct them. Second remakes will not be done without direct student supervision. 2. All remake images will be documented in the chart just as original exposures are recorded. 7.16 Patients with Known or Suspected Infectious Diseases Patients with a known or suspected infectious disease will be treated the same as any other patient, using the normal and proper barrier techniques and appropriate medical consultations as detailed in this section. It is the policy of the Health Science Ce nter and its clinics that students, faculty, and staff participate in the treatment of all patients. Refusal will result in expulsion of students (whether pre -doctoral or advanced education) from the academic program ) or termination of employment. 7.17 Use of Radiography Operatories 63 1. Extraoral Radiographic Procedures a. Students, faculty and staff, hereafter referred to as operators, will employ barrier techniques at all times. b. When available, powder -free gloves should be used for all radiographic procedur es. c. When applicable, operators shall cover with plastic (bags or stick -on sheets) those areas of the chin rest, head restraint apparatus, cassette holder, controls, tubehead and any other areas where contaminated gloved hands will be in contact during pati ent positioning and exposures. d. After each extraoral study with PSP or CCD /CMOS , the patient is returned to the waiting area. With gloves still on, all coverings are then removed, being careful not to touch any surfaces. Additionally, after each panoramic procedure , the operator, with gloves on, shall remove and dispose of the incisal positioning pin. Gloves are then removed. e. All operators should employ barrier techniques at all times. Staff will occupy shielded control room during acquisition to monitor t he acquisition process, the patient, and to ensure operator protection from radiation. This will be applicable to cone beam CT and all other extraoral procedures. A member of the public will not be allowed into the acquisition area, without prior consent o f the attending radiologist, and that too only if a by -stander is required for a pediatric patient. In such circumstances, the by -stander will be required to adhere to recommended safety protocols including use of appropriate lead aprons, under direct supe rvision of the attending or technologist. f. No contrast -enhanced studies are to be performed in the clinics. (What about sialography?) Do we do this procedure? If we do, please describe. NOTE: For direct digital systems, the patient is released before break down, disinfection and finalization of image(s) prior to final archiving. 2. Intraoral Radiographic Procedure a. Operators will employ barrier techniques at all times. b. When available, powder -free gloves should be used for all radiographic procedures. c. To minimize contamination in a radiographic operatory, the following steps shall be taken: i. Before seating the patient, the counter top where instruments and cotton rolls will be placed shall be covered with an opened patient napkin. Instruments should never come in contact with a bare counter. ii. Cover the chair headrest, chair back, and side controls with a large plastic utility bag. If large bags are not available, use an individual headrest cover and stick -on plastic sheet to cover the chair controls. iii. Cover the yoke and tube head with a large plastic utility bag. Use tape to keep the excess plastic from hanging down from the cone. If bags are not available then pre & post procedure wipes (utilizing an appropriately approved disinfectant) for disinfection shall be used. iv. Use stick -on plastic sheets to cover all controls including the exposure button, kVp knob, and timer. v. Once the patient is seated with lead apron in place, mask and gloves are put on. After the procedure has started, contaminated gloved hands shall only come in contact with covered surfaces. If by accident an uncovered area is contaminated, that area shall be wiped with disinfectant soaked gauze. vi. All exposed PSP sensors shall be dried with a paper towel and placed in a dirty\" paper/plastic cup. Do not touch the outside of the cup with contaminated gloved hands. vii. After the completion of the procedure, have the patient remove and rehang the lead apron on the wall or leave it on the chair seat. Then dismiss the patient back to the waiting area. . viii. With h ands still gloved, all film holding devices shall be disassembled and washed with a brush, soap and water. They should be individually dried and placed in sterilization bags 64 that are provided in each operatory. Sealed bags containing instruments are then p laced in a collection box located in the hallway. ix. Once instruments have been cleaned and bagged, carefully remove all coverings so as not to touch any uncontaminated surfaces. Wipe any areas that are accidentally touched with disinfectant. x. De-glove and car ry the \"clean \" cup holding unwrapped ClinAsept films to the darkroom bare -handed. No darkroom infection control procedures will be needed. xi. Before going to the scanner with the exposed PSP sensors , the following protocol should be followed to remove the PSP plastic outer covers: After sensors have been exposed , each having been dried and dropped in a cup, the \"dirty\" cup is placed on a patient napkin. The plastic covering of each sensor is opened gently, letting each uncovered \"clean\" sensor fall into a \"clean\" carry box which is next to (but not on) the patient napkin. Wrappers are collected on the \"dirty\" patient napkin. The napkin/\"dirty cup\" wrappers are then thrown into the trash case. The carry box of sensors are taken into the digital scanning a rea bare -handed and opened bare -handed. No new gloves need to be worn.

February 2001. 8.0 COLLEGE OF DENTISTRY POLICY FOR PROFESSIONAL VARIANCES, SUSPENSION FROM CLINICAL ACTIVITIES AND CLEARANCE FOR GRADUATION 8.1 Professional Behavior The College of Dentistr y expects all dental students to behave as professionals in their dealings with patients, colleagues, faculty and staff and to exhibit caring and compassionate attitudes. These and other qualities will be evaluated during patient contacts and in other rele vant settings. The behavior of a dental student reflects on a student's qualification and potential to become a competent dentist. Attitudes and behaviors inconsistent with compassionate care, refusal by or inability of the student to participate construct ively in learning or patient care, derogatory attitudes or inappropriate behavior directed at patient groups, peers, faculty or staff, or other unprofessional conduct can be grounds for dismissal. In conferring the DMD degree, the University of Florida ce rtifies that the student is competent to undertake a career as a dentist. It also certifies that in addition to competency in dental knowledge and skills, the graduate possesses those personal traits essential to the profession of dentistry. Professionalis m encompasses altruism, accountability, compassion, duty, excellence and respect for others. 8.2 Monitoring, Reporting and Disciplining Variance in Student Professional Behavior On occasion, a student may vary from the positive expression of the college's core values by displaying unprofessional behavior. Their actions may be directed not only to individuals but also to property. On such occasions, these variances need to be reported, documented, feedback needs to be given to the student and actio n may be taken by the College. 65 8.3 Professional Variance Forms: A form is available at the college website for reporting variances in student professional behavior: Link- Professional V ariance Form This form can be used to document and provide feedback for variances in professional behavior both in clinical and academic settings. 1. A faculty or staff member observing student deviating from expected behavior must complete the form. 2. Once the form is completed, the faculty/staff member must meet with the student to discuss the observed behavior and more appropriate alternative behaviors. 3. The student has the opportunity to respond as indicated on the form if s/he so desires. 4. Both the student and the faculty/staff sign the form. 5. Copies of the signed form are given to the student, faculty/staff, and Office of Academic Affairs . Forms are maintained in the student conduct files in the Office of Academic Affairs . All variances are cumu lative over the entire course of enrollment in the DMD program. 8.4 Counseling and Disciplinary Action First offense : The student and faculty or staff member completing the form must meet to discuss the incident and sign the form. The copy of the form di stributed to the student will serve as a written warning and self - corrective action is anticipated. A copy of the first variance is placed in the student conduct file in the Office of Academic Affairs . A neutral third party, such as a department chair, Tea m leader, course director, clinical or education representative should also be part of this meeting. Second offense : A counseling appointment is completed by the As soc. Dean for Student Advocacy and Inclusion and appropriate faculty, including TEAM leader, or others as appropriate. At this meeting, the student, faculty or staff member and Ass oc. Dean for Student Advocacy and Inclusion complete the form, discuss the incident and sign the form. A plan for corre ctive action is discussed with the student and documented. Record of second variance is placed in the student conduct file in the Office of Academic Affairs . Third offense : A counseling appointment is completed by the Associate Dean for Education/Associ ate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality, and As soc. Dean for Student Advocacy and Inclusion and appropriate faculty, including TEAM leader, or others as appropriate. At this meeting, the student, faculty or staff member and Associate Deans complete the form, discuss the incident and sign the form. A plan for corrective action is discussed with student and documented. Record of third variance is placed in the student conduct file in the Office of Academic Affairs . A suspension from school may be issued a t the discretion of the appropriate Associate Dean (see above) or the Associate Dean may elect to issue a \"U\" grade in the enrolled Professionalism course. Student is referred to SPEC. Any future variances will result in immediate referral to SPEC. Some types of behavior may be so egregious as to justify immediate suspension or dismissal of a student. Such behavior might include criminal acts, persistent substance abuse, and blatant disregard for patient safety or flagrant academic dishonesty. 8.5 Off -Hour Use of Physical Facilities 66 Off-hour access to secured areas, such as clinics and classrooms, is prohibited except in dire emergencies. In those emergencies, contact security .. Security will record the caller's name, phone number, reason for access, and the room. If there is any question, security will contact the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality for authorization. These records are maintained for future review. Access to the dental lab, D3 -31 (Junior/Senior Lab), is permitted to junio rs and seniors 24 hours per day, with the exceptions of special scheduled activities. After -hours access to the simulation lab is available through scheduled sessions with lab monitors providing oversight. 8.6 College of Dentistry Graduation Clearance All UFCD students must obtain signatures from the various departments and all administrative units to be documented as cleared for graduation. 9.0 INFECTIOUS DISEASE POLICY 9.1 Introduction The University of Florida, College of Dentistry has the right and the obligation to adopt policies which are designed to protect the health of the students, faculty, staff, and patients of the College. It has been well established that a medical history is not reliable for the detection of infectious diseases. To maintain maximum levels of protection, the following guidelines emphasize adherence to standard (universal) precautions that produce blood and saliva from dental procedures and other potentially in fectious materials (OPIM) be handled in a manner consistent with state and federal guidelines. The College expects that appropriate professional judgment shall be used by the faculty in all matters related to infection control procedures in preclinical and clinical settings. UFCD policies are in accordance with UF Health Shands Hospital Infection Control Policies and UF Environmental Health and Safety requirements. The following policy was designed based on the following references from the Centers for Dise ase Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, OSHA, and Florida State Statutes. 1. Center for Disease Control. Guidelines for Preventing the Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Health -Care Settings, 2005. MMWR 2005; 54 (No. RR -17, 1 -141. \\ 2. Center for Disease Control. Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health -Care Settings - 2003, MMWR 2003;52, No RR -17. 1 -76. 3. Revision to OSHA's Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, April 2016 4. \"Occupational Exposure to Bloodborne Pathogens Rule,\" Federal Register, April 8, 2001 . 5. Florida Administrative Code, Department of Health. The Bloodborne Pathogen Exposure Control Plan and Hazardous Waste Management Plan are in accordance with the University Environmental Health and Safety Policies. Copies of documents can be found on -line at http://www.ehs.ufl.edu/ . Responsibility for review and update of these policies rests with the UFCD Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality , the Clinical Affairs Committee, the ad hoc Infection Control Committee and CQuIT subcom mittee. 1. The College of Dentistry Occupational Health Requirements and Infectious Disease Policy is applicable to students, faculty, staff, and patients. The policy outlines the responsibilities of each group and consequences of non -compliance or inadequate perform ance. 2. The Infection Control Clinical Protocol is applicable to students, faculty, staff and patients. The policy outlines routine disinfection and sterilization procedures to be employed when treating all College of 67 Dentistry patients. 9.2 Patient M anagement All patients shall be managed in a manner which preserves their dignity and provides for confidentiality. By law and in accordance with University of Florida Health Science Center policy, patients may not be denied treatment for reasons of infec tivity. It is unlawful to require any person to submit to an HIV -related test as a condition of treatment. Patients with urgent dental care needs diagnosed with active infectious/contagious diseases, such as but not limited to chicken pox or measles, sh ould be managed by appropriate (immune) faculty in the Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Clinic. Non -emergency patients with transitory infection should be rescheduled subsequent to resolution of symptoms. Patients infected with HIV, or chronic carriers of He patitis B or Hepatitis C, may be treated in the student clinics after appropriate medical consultation. Patients with advanced HIV disease, acute hepatitis, or other medically compromised conditions requiring additional expertise may be referred to advance d education program clinics or to faculty, pending complexity of medical and dental needs. Patients with signs and/or symptoms of undiagnosed disease may be screened by dental faculty for laboratory markers of infectious disease as needed to deliver appro priate care or may be referred to the appropriate physician. Patients with confirmed or signs and symptoms of active tuberculosis shall be managed according to the College TB Infection Control Protocol. Elective care shall be deferred pending medical evaluation and treatment. Patients requiring emergency care will b e referred to UF Health Shands Emergency Department for immediate triage and treatment. On -call oral and maxillofacial surgery residents will be contacted as needed. All dental records will be maintained in such a manner as to preserve patient confidential ity, following established HIPAA guidelines. Patients with a known infectious disease will be accepted for treatment in the UF Dental Clinics under the same guidelines as non -infectious patients, except for any limitations which may be listed above. All p atients will be seen for any emergency dental care and/or scheduled for consultation regarding routine dental care. Following the consultation appointment, every effort will be made to provide routine care. The provision of routine dental care for all pat ients is, however, dependent on space and faculty or student time limitations. 9.3 Hepatitis B Immunization Requirements 1. Students The College requires all dental students (pre -doctoral and advanced education) to have the hepatitis B immunization or show proof of protection (HbsAb titer) prior to entering any clinical phase of their program. This is required of entering students. Completion of this immunizat ion is a student responsibility 2. Clinical Faculty and Staff a. All clinical faculty and staff must be i mmunized against Hepatitis B. Within 10 working days after clinical assignment, they are required to either have the hepatitis B immunization, show proof of antibody protection (HbsAb titer) or have initiated the series. b. Hepatitis B vaccine and HbsAb ti ter tests will be provided at no charge to the employee and will be arranged through the office of the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . Special exemptions will require a letter from the employee's physician. c. The College may require employee s whose contracts are renewed on an annual basis, with no expectation of continuing employment, to submit to the vaccination as a condition of their contract renewal. 68 9.4 Policies Regarding Infectious Disease Status It is the policy of the University of Florida to assess the needs of students or employees with HIV infection or other communicable diseases on a case -by-case basis. If any such infection occurs in a dental student, any recommendations made or actions taken by the College of Dentistry will res pect the confidentiality and welfare of the student, while also recognizing and responding to issues regarding the welfare of patients, the College of Dentistry and the hospital and outpatient clinics. Each student's situation will be evaluated by the College on a case -by-case basis. With the permission of the affected student, the Director of the Student Health Care Center (a physician) will assist in the coordination of resources and services. Currently, the UF College of Dentistry does not require routin e HIV testing of patients, students or healthcare workers. However, it is certainly prudent for individual healthcare workers, including students, to be aware of their own individual HIV status so that they can take appropriate precautions and measures. Wi th current advances in treatment of HIV infection, early intervention can be crucial in maintaining well -being and delaying complications of the illness. If future state or federal legislation were to change guidelines or requirements for HIV testing of he althcare workers or healthcare students, the College of Dentistry will comply as required. In the event of a potential bloodborne pathogen exposure in a student, the medical provider will recommend HIV testing as a baseline and also follow -up intervals of 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months. When testing is medically advisable, it is subject to informed consent, and results are treated confidentially. 9.5 Procedures to Prevent Transmission of Infectious Diseases 1. Students, faculty, and staff shall routinely adhere to universal precautions including the appropriate use of hand washing, protective barriers, and care in the use and disposal of needles and other sharp instruments. a. Gloves, mask, and protective eyewear (goggles or protective face shields) shall be worn during all patient contacts and most preclinical procedures (at faculty discretion). b. Gloves shall be changed after contact with each patient or as procedures or glove defects dictate. c. Torn gloves shall be replaced as soon as discovered. d. Hand hygiene shall be performed with either a non -antimicrobial or antimicrobial soap and water when hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with blood or other potentially infectious material. If hands are not visibly soiled, an alcohol -based hand rub can b e used. e. Masks shall be changed during patient treatment if the mask becomes wet. 2. Students, faculty, and staff shall routinely wear clean surgical scrubs or cover gowns for each patient contact that has the potential to disseminate blood and/or saliva. Protective clothing will cover personal clothing and skin (e.g., forearms) likely to be soiled with blood, saliva, or OPIM. 3. Students, faculty, and staff shall strictly adhere to the Clinical Protocol as outlined in Section 9.11 (below). 4. Students, faculty, and staff who have exudative lesions or weeping dermatitis shall refrain from all direct patient care until the condition resolves. 9.6 Non -Compliance with Infection Control Policy 1. Students a. Initial failure by a student to comply with infection control policies shall be recognized and handled immediately upon discovery by the attending faculty or staff. Faculty shall provide counseling and direct corrective action appropriate for the protocol violation. The health and safety of the faculty, staff, students, and patients must not be compromised. The Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality shall be notified of the incident. 69 b. Continued failure by a student to comply with infection control policies will result in generation of a Professional Variance and review by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality , clinical suspen sion, and possible referral to the Student Performance Evaluation Committee (SPEC). Non - compliance will be considered as academic incompetence. 2. Faculty and Staff a. Failure by the faculty or staff to comply with infection control policies will result in revi ew by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality , with a report to the employee's supervisor, department chair, or College Dean as appropriate b. Non -compliance will be considered as inadequate job performance. 3. Patients a. Patient noncompliance or falsification of the historical medical record may result in dismissal from the College dental care program by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . b. Follow -up measures will be coordinated by the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quali ty. 9.7 Management of Exposures The Florida Legislature in the 1990 session addressed the concerns of injured medical personnel. \"Medical personnel\" shall include a licensed or certified health care professional; an employee of a health care professional, health care facility, or blood b ank. In June, 2001, the CDC published \"Updated U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HBV, HCV, and HIV and Recommendations for Post -exposure Prophylaxis\" MMWR (50 RR 11) p. 1 -42 (Appendix A). More recently, the CDC published \"Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health -Care Settings - 2003,\" Vol. 52, No. RR -17 and \"U.S. Public Health Service Guidelines for the Management of Occupational Exposures to HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C,\" September 30, 200 5 http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov . These publications serve as the basis for the post -exposure management of percutaneous and mucous membrane exposures within the UFCD. Post -exposure management of percutaneous injuries and mucous membrane exposures will be handled by the University of Florida Student Health Care Center (SHCC) in accordance with the University of Florida Environmental Health and Safety Biological Safety Office \" 2021 Exposure Control Pla n with Policies. \" These policies are in compliance with OSHA standard 1919.1030 and Florida Statutes. The UF College of Dentistry follows the same Occupational Exposure Protocol as UF Colleges of Medicine, Nursing and Pharmacy. Because some treatment re gimens for bloodborne pathogen exposures must be started within 1 -2 hours of exposure, the following guidelines were established to ensure prompt and appropriate care for those who have sustained a potential exposure: needlestick, sharps injury, mucous membrane splash, or human bite. \\ NEEDLESTICK HOTLINE NUMBER: (352) 265 -2727 Call 24 Hour s a Day, 7 days a week in the Gainesville area 9.8 Occupational Exposure Protocol for Needlestick 1. Stop procedure, cleanse skin with antibacterial soap, or flush eye with clean water. 2. Advise attending faculty of incident. 3. Call Needlestick Hotline (352) 2 65-2727 at SHCC (Student Health Care Center). Identify yourself as a UFCD employee or student and report that you've had an exposure. Be prepared to leave a \"call back\" number with them so you can be reached. Keep that line open so they may immediately re turn the call. 4. Faculty may need to assist in bringing the procedure to safe closure. 5. Faculty will discuss the exposure event with the source patient and explain the UFCD protocol. The source patient may be asked to have their blood drawn if so directed by SHCC medical provider. This includes having their blood drawn and tested for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, and HIV at no expense to the source patient. 6. When SHCC calls back, give a description of the incident, including what is known about the source patient' s history. If advised to proceed with protocol, follow the SHCC instructions. 70 7. If SHCC recommends proceeding with testing, the UFCD attending faculty will verbally confirm permission from the source patient for testing. The UFHealth exposure consent form must be signed by the source patient and attending faculty granting consent to be tested. The name of the exposed HCW should not be included in the record. 8. The exposed HCW and the source patient will be escorted by Clinic Admin representative to the UF outpatient lab on the the1st floor of UFHealth , to have blood drawn for lab tests requested by SHCC. SHCC will complete the \"Exposure Ordering/Billing Form\" \"Source Patient\" and the \"Health Care Worker\" and provide both lab order sheets to th e Clinic Admin representative. 9. The source patient may be verbally informed of their test results by the attending faculty. 10. Follow -up appointments for exposed HCP (employees and students) may be scheduled with SHCC in UFHealth satellite clinic, D2 -49 (294 -5700) or SHCC on main campus (392 -1161, ext. 1 -4212) NOTE: If the exposed HCP is faculty or a paid resident, they should contact Amerisys (Worker's Compensation) at (800) 455 -2079 to open a claim so expenses will be covered by Worker's Compensation 11. Injured Health Care Worker (student, staff, resident, faculty) should submit Occupational Exposure IDinc event report . 12. Documentation of the incident and lab results will be mai ntained in a confidential file at SHCC. SHCC will provide annual reports to UFCD. 13. If an occupational exposure occurs while the student is participating in an extramural rotation, the student should follow the established protocol of the clinical organization overseeing the rotation. The student must call the needlestick hotline on the d ay of occurrence so that a ppropriate follow -up is arranged for the student by the Student Health Care Center (SHCC). Additionally, on the day of occurrence, the student will submit a report in the event reporting system (IDinc). The supervising dentist should contact the course director for external rotations on the day of the occurrence . 9.9 Patient Contact Health Requirements 1. Pre-doctoral , Advanced Education Students and employees : For predoctoral dental program entry, immunization compliance is managed by the UF Health Compliance Office within the Student Health Care Center. https://healthcompliance.shcc.ufl.edu/ Immunizations required for Health MMR/MEASLES, MUMPS, RUBELLA VACCINE: Required For everyone born after December 32, 1956. Two doses are required. You must have received on or after 12 months of age AND in 1971 or later.

Health Provider - Basic Life Support (BLS -CPR with AED) Certification Each predoctoral student must complete a Health Provider -BLS (CPR /AED) certification prior to participating in the DMD Orientation. The certi ficate MUST reflect training between July 1 and August 31, of the year entering the program. UFCD strongly recommends that you take the American Heart Association -Basic Life Support (BLS) for Healthcare Provider (CPR and AED) initial or renewal training. The course MUST include hands -on demonstration of the skills or online individual skills assessment. (American Red Cross courses would not be recommended as the certification expires in one year. There are other choices other than AHA that provide a two-year certification . Any of those would also be acceptable.) 3. Must consistently maintain medical insurance coverage: All newly admitted or re -admitted domestic students who are enrolled at least half -time in a degree - seeking program along with all internati onal students are required to purchase the Student Health Insurance Plan unless proof of comparable coverage is provided. Proof of comparable coverage is provided annually. a. UF Plan Rates and Dates: https://healthcompliance.shcc.ufl.edu/health -insurance - - requirement/comparable -coverage/ 9.10 Guidelines to Reduce Exposure to Latex and Glove Powders To protect the health of faculty, staff, students, and patients, the College has implemented practices to reduce (but not totally eliminate) exposure to potentially harmful allergens from latex and powdered gloves. Powder -free nitrile gloves are available in all clinical areas. These should be used exclusively for protection of patients, students, and employees. 9.11 Infection Control - Clinical Protocol The 2003 CDC Guidelines are a comprehensive and evidence -based source for infection control practices developed for the protection of dental care workers and their patients (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Guidelines for Infection Control in Dental Health -Care Settings \u20142003. MMWR 2003; 52 (No.RR - 17). The ADA Statement on Infection Control in Dental Settings released February 9, 2011 recommends all practicing dentists, dental auxiliaries and dental laboratories employ standard precautions as described in the 2003 CDC Guidelines. In 2016, the CDC produce a companion document Summary of Infection Prevention Practice in Dental Settings: Basic Expectations for Safe Care to help dental offices with practical application of the 2003 guidelines with the subsequent upda tes in 2008 and 2011 . 72 Additionally, dental health care providers are expected to follow procedures as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The OSHA Infection Control Standard OSHA Rule 29 CFR 1910.1030 website: http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&p_id=10051 The UFCD Hand Hygiene Technique is provided in Appendix G . Standard universal prec autions are used for all patients. Barrier techniques and the clinical protocol outlined below will help ensure hygienic practices and infection control. Such activities shall become the routine modus operandi for all patients. The following represents a general procedural outline for clinical infection control. Specific modifications unique to individual departments have been formulated and ar e published in course syllabi. 1. Surface Disinfection Surface disinfection will be accomplished with the SPRAY -WIPE -SPRAY (or Wipe - Discard -Wipe if using approved disinfectant wipes) method recommended by CDC between each patient. Surface disinfectants must be EPA registered and have the ability to kill TB organisms on room temperature surfaces in 10 minutes o r less. Spray - wipe with paper towel and spray again. Let stand and remain wet for the amount of time recommended by the manufacturer. If the surface has not \"air dried,\" a clean paper towel may be used to absorb the excess. Surface disinfectant wipes may be used for routine counter -top cleaning providing they are tuberculocidal and used according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 2. Operatory Set -Up a. Predoctoral student b ack packs, jackets, and books shall be placed in appropriate locations ( student locker and/or the approved and lid secured plastic bin located in each operatory ) so as not to become contaminated by aerosols or contaminate working surfaces or counter or mobile tops. (If this occurs, surfaces shall be disinfected again with an approved disi nfectant.) b. Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) must be worn when disinfect ing and prepar ing the dental unit (see Appendix L for PPE donning and removal guidance). A small red biomedical waste bag, found in each clinical area, must be affixed to the operat ory cabinet. In addition, tape a clear trash bag next to the red bag for \"non -biomedical waste\". Clinical waste will be segregated as described in the chart entitled \"Approved Methods for Disposal of Clinical Waste.\" c. Flush air/water syringe(s) for 20 -30 se conds. Turn on the faucet and suction about a cup of water through the high volume evacuator and saliva ejector. Once you have your start check from faculty, then you will set up your handpiece, and you will need to flush water through the handpiece for 20 - 30 seconds. d. Disinfect the patient chair by utilizing the wipe -discard -wipe method or a spray -wipe -spray method with an approved surface disinfectant. Being certain to scrub the headrest, chair back, seat, and arms. Pay close attention to disinfect the chair controls . Wipe again with disinfectant and allow to air dry. e. Remove and dispose gloves. Perform hand hygiene. If foot/knee operated controls are not available, turn faucet handles on/off with paper towel or elbows when possible to avoid cross -contami nation. f. Various items used during a procedure are not autoclavable, easily disinfected, or disposable. These are likely to include, but not be limited to, BP cuff, forms, keyboard, mouse and pens. These items should be kept in the uncontaminated area of th e lidded box . To avoid cross -contamination, use over gloves or apply barriers to forms and pens. g. It is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to take the time to plan the procedure and set it up properly, and utilize the provided supply container . It will save time and prese rve the integrity of the operatory. Gather the instruments(s), disposable supplies, and equipment required for the procedure. h. Set up protective covers and supplies. 73 (1) Cover any tables and counter top(s) wh ere instruments will be placed. (2) Place chart, pencils, pens, and mask on counter top. Cover pens and pencils which you anticipate hand ling during the course of treatment with plastic wrap. (3) Cover light handles and the switch with barrier. (4) Place large plastic bags over the bracket table. (5) Place a small plastic bag over saliva ejector and suction arm. (6) Place headrest cover. (7) Cover faucet handle(s) with barrier. (8) Cover any device(s) to be used during the procedure. (9) Place disposable barrier on air/water syringe tip, saliva ejector and high volume evacuator. Retain t he barriers throughout patient's appointment. NOTE: Do not instruct the patient during treatment to \"close his mouth around the saliva ejector.\" Doing so may create a negative pressure and bring fluids from the hose back into the patient's mouth. Use the saliva ejector so air can circulate around it. Pl ace UNOPENED sterile instrument tray(s) on mobile and arrange the UNOPENED bag of sterile cotton pellets, cotton rolls, gauze, floss, articulating paper, and devices on the mobile as appropriate. DO NOT place trays/instruments on the dental unit. 3. Dental P rocedure a. Prior to seating a patient, be certain an attending faculty is in the clinic. b. Prior to treating a patient, obtain a start check from the attending faculty which will include verification of instrument sterility. (Do not open instrument trays or ba gs until they are checked by faculty.) c. Request the patient to rinse with mouthwash to reduce the number of transmissible micro - organisms. Perform hand hygiene. d. Seat the patient, adjust the chair, and place the patient napkin and patient protective eyewea r (must provide top and side protection). Disinfected eyewear will be available from the central supply room in the clinic . Because normal prescription lens frames do not offer adequate protection for aerosol producing procedures, goggles, face shields, o r prescription frames with solid side shields are required. Prescription lens frames with side shields are available from some optical companies. Students are responsible for purchasing their own eyewear. e. Review medical history, take a blood pressure, an d request any additional history. f. Perform hand hygiene . Put on (don) gown, mask, eyewear, then gloves (in that order). Arrange instruments on the tray. g. After presenting the patient's case for the day and obtaining the faculty approval at start check, unwrap instrument cover with clean gloved hands, so as to provide a clean field on the mobile table. h. Begin the procedure. Apply topical anesthetic and administer the anesthetic injection(s) as required. All disposable needles , unless equipped with self -sheathing safety devices, will be recapped using the one -hand \"scoop\" method or needle -recap safety device. i. When using an air driven highspeed handpiece, c lean the fiber optic light transmitting surfaces of handpiece with a cotton swab wet with isopropyl alcohol. j. Isolate the operative area by placing a rubber dam as appropriate. Confine instruments, devices, and supplies that come into contact with the patient to a limited area to reduce chance of cross - conta mination and enhance clean up. Wipe instruments carefully during the course of treatment to minimize scrubbing. Keep instruments organized on the tray. Dispose of waste into patient cups or trash bags. k. When the procedure is completed, remove the patient napkin and place it (plastic side up) over the 74 used instruments. Remove patient protective eyewear and place it on the patient napkin. Suggest that patients rinse mouth and/or wash hands at the termination of treatment as appropriate. l. Remove gloves, eye wear, mask, and gown in that order. Perform hand hygiene. Finish required documentation in the patient record obtaining faculty approvals as required. m. At any point during patient care, upon leaving the operatory to find faculty, de -glove and perform hand hygiene. n. Escort the patient to the cashier. 4. Operatory Clean -Up a. Put on personal protective equipment (gown, mask, goggles, and gloves). Dispose of the patient napkin covering the instruments. Remove the saliva ejector and HVE and place them in the red biom edical waste bag. b. Flush the handpiece hose(s) and air/water syringe(s) for one minute. Turn on the faucet and suction about a cup of water through the high volume evacuator and saliva ejector hoses and handles. c. Do not immerse the handpiece in water. Shak e the handpiece slightly to remove excess water. Dry the handpieces and attachments thoroughly using paper towel or air from a syringe. After removing bur, disc, brush, or prophy cup from handpiece, separate attachment(s) from motor and replace to the hand piece cassette . Replace cassette inside the carrying bin. d. Replace useful burs to the block(s) or holder(s). Dispose burs that are not useful in sharps container in the operatory. e. Return clinic equipment to the clinic's \"contaminated items\" cart for disinfection by clinic staff. f. Surplus amalgam and used amalgam capsules are considered biohazardous waste. These will be collected and placed in the large labeled plastic containers located in the center lab. g. Remove all coverings from chair, dental unit , and light and dispose of into clear plastic trash bag. h. All syringe needles, cartridges, suture needles, and scalpel blades will be discarded into a specially marked plastic \"sharps\" box , located in the operatory in plain view (most often on the counter ) All non-glass or non -metal disposables will be placed into the appropriate trash bag. i. Clean and disinfect all eyewear. eplace instruments to the tray in order. Open all hinged instruments to permit a sterilizing agent contact to all surfaces. Place cass ette inside the carrying case for central sterilization. Remove coverings from mobile(s) and counter top(s). j. Repeat disinfectant spray, paper towel wipe down, and respraying of the unit, patient, and operator chair(s), mobile(s), counter top(s), sink(s), faucet(s) and exterior of all carrying bins for central sterilization . Wipe the operating light and patient chair switches using a paper towel moistened with disinfectant. This procedure may be completed using disinfectant wipes using the wipe -discard - wipe method. k. Remove the clear plastic trash bag and red biomedical waste bag. Tape the clear plastic bag closed and dispose in the clear bag waste receptacles, located throughout the clinic. Close the red bag and place it in the \"Biohazard Waste Only\" recept acles, located in the clinic and clearly marked \"Biohazard Waste Only.\" Remove gloves and perform hand hygiene. Place the instrument cassettes, handpieces, and bur blocks into the clear plastic bin with lid for transport to Central Sterilization. l. No conta minated instruments are to be left in the clinic over the noon break or after 5:00 p.m. 5. Dental Assistants Responsibility for Clean -up a. Daily: Disinfect equipment returned to the \"contaminated items\" cart, and return to the clinic storage room. b. Daily: Superv ise the student dentists' compliance with infection control standards and OSHA regulations in the clinics. Address infection control variances with students as applies, and report the variance to the Team Leader. c. At least once each week, but more often i f required by usage, all vacuum hoses (saliva ejector and HVE) shall be cleaned, deodorized, and sanitized by suctioning a quart of cleaner (i.e., OR - EVAC from Schein or PUREVACE from Sultan) prepared according to the manufacturer's 75 instructions, through e ach hose. d. Each week, disposable solid traps shall be replaced and permanent solid traps, located at the bottom of units so equipped, shall be cleaned (more often if suction is weak.) Contact Dental Maintenance for assistance. Clinic staff must follow pro tocols to decontaminate the trap, process and label and place in the designated hazardous waste management satellite accumulation area in the clinic. e. Schedule floor care as needed. Contact housekeeping to establish, and then maintain optimal condition of our floors on a regular basis (bi -monthly). 6. Laboratory Protocol The college advocates a \"clean lab\" policy to ensure effective dental laboratory infe ction control. All items entering the lab must be cleaned and disinfected before being transported to the lab. Disinfection can be achieved with an EPA registered disinfectant in accordance with manufacturer recommendations for compatibility and contact t ime. The brands Cavicide and Opticide3 are approved for use. Gloves are not allowed in the lab. Items that have been effectively disinfected can be handled with bare hands. Student compliance with lab protocols during patient care sessions shall be the imm ediate responsibility of the attending clinical faculty. 9.12 Management of Extracted Teeth (MMWR, May 28, 1993, Vol. 42, RR -8) The CDC and Florida Statutes require that extracted teeth must be rendered non -biohazardous by disinfection so they may be returned to the patient or the patient's legal guardian. These teeth should be cleansed of adherent material by scrubbing with deter gent and water or cleaned in an ultrasonic unit. Teeth should be immersed in a fresh solution of sodium hypochlorite (1:10 dilution) or any liquid chemical germicide suitable for fixation in 10 minutes. If this method is used for teeth used in pre -clinic al modules, appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) will be worn and teeth will be treated as potentially infectious material. Alternatively, teeth used for practice in the simulation laboratory will be sterilized by steam autoclaving for 40 minute s at 121 degrees C and 15 psi to render them free of viable organisms. To avoid making the teeth brittle, the drying cycle should not be used during autoclaving or dry heat sterilization. Use universal precautions, gloves, mask, eye protection, and disinfe ct contaminated surfaces when handling extracted teeth. 9.13 Infection Control Variance s The UFCD clinics strive to maintain the highest level of infection control for the health and well-being of patients, students, faculty and staff. To enhance complia nce with UFCD Infection Control Policies, the following protocol has been established in all pre -doctoral clinics. Attending faculty and clinical staff are to mentor students by encouraging appropriate compliance. When an i nfection control variance is reco gnized by faculty or staff and addressed with the student the event is documented using the Professional Variance reporting mechanism. This process alerts the Office for Academic Affairs and the course director for the appropriate professionalism stream course (DEN6015, DEN7017, DEN8018) . Additionally, sharps breaches that reach sterilization will be reported into the IDinc event reporting database in order to provide feedback mechanisms for training and orientation. 9.14 Other Examples of Non -Compliance Behaviors that may result in faculty or staff initiating a variance include, but are not restricted to, the following : 1. Breach of any infection control policy 2. Failure to begin each clini cal session with sterile instruments (even if the same patient is being seen morning and afternoon in the same clinic). 3. Improper management of instruments, sharps, or impressions, during a clinical procedure 76 4. Improper or inadequate barrier precautions 5. Cove r-gown variance (these are not to be worn outside of the clinic) 6. Improper or inadequate hand washing/or gloving procedures (i.e., failure to remove gloves when leaving the operatory) 7. Lack of solid side -shields on eyewear for aerosol or splatter producing p rocedures 8. Lack of protective eyewear for patients 9. Personal hygiene variance (i.e., long fingernails, operator's hair touchi ng a patient's face or shoulders, or excessively stained attire) 9.15 Administrative Procedures If, during a start check procedure or anytime during a patient care session, faculty or staff observe non - compliance with clinic protocols, a Professional Variance ( PV) may be generated (refer to Appendix H to view a copy of the Infection Control Variance form). All Professional Variances are logged into a database maintained by the Office of Academic Affairs . Refer to Section 9.13 above for the Professional Variance Policy and subsequent administrative follow -up as appropriate. 9.16 Radiography Infection Control Procedures Radiography Operatories 1. Extraoral Radiographic Procedures: Students, faculty and staff, hereafter referred to as operators, will employ barrier techniques at all times. 2. Appropriate PPE (gloves) will be used for all radiographi c procedures. Interim CDC guidelines will be followed during a pandemic, such as universal masking in health care delivery environments, such as clinics and lobbies of clinical enterprises. 3. Extraoral images should be exposed and processed prior to any intr aoral exposures, whenever possible. 4. When applicable, operators shall cover with plastic bags or stick -on sheets those areas of the chin rest, head restraint apparatus, cassette holder, controls, tubehead, and any other areas where contaminated gloved hands will be in contact during patient positioning and exposures. 5. After each extraoral study with conventional film, PSP, or CCD (direct digital), the patient is returned to the waiting area. With gloves still on, all coverings are then removed, being careful not to touch any surfaces. Additionally, after each panoramic patient, the operator, with gloves on, shall remove and dispose of the incisal positioning pin. Gloves are then removed. The cassette can then be removed and taken to the darkroom or scanning a rea in the case of PSP sensors. Note: For direct digital systems, the patient is released before breakdown, disinfection, and finalization of image(s) prior to final archiving. 9.17 Intraoral Radiographic Procedure 1. Operators will employ barrier techniqu es at all times. 2. When available, powder -free gloves should be used for all radiographic procedures. 3. To minimize contamination in a radiographic operatory, the following steps shall be taken: a. Before seating the patient, the counter top where instruments and cotton rolls will be placed shall be covered with an opened patient napkin. Instruments should never come in contact with a bare counter. 77 b. Cover the chair headrest, chair back, and side con trols with a large plastic utility bag. If large bags are not available, use an individual headrest cover and stick -on plastic sheet to cover the chair controls. c. Cover the yoke and tube head with a large plastic utility bag. Use tape to keep the excess plastic from hanging down from the cone. If bags are not available then pre & post procedure wipes (utilizing an appropriately approved disinfectant) for disinfection shall be used. d. Use stick -on plastic sheets to cover all controls including the exposure button, kVp knob, and timer. e. Once the patient is seated with lead apron in place, mask and gloves are put on. After the procedure has started, contaminated gloved hands shall only come in contact with covered surfaces. If by accident an uncovered are a is contaminated, that area shall be wiped with disinfectant soaked gauze. f. All exposed PSP sensors shall be dried with a paper towel and placed in a dirty\" paper/plastic cup. Do not touch the outside of the cup with contaminated gloved hands. g. After the completion of the procedure, have the patient remove and rehang the lead apron on the wall or leave it on the chair seat. Then dismiss the patient back to the waiting area.. h. With hands still gloved, all film holding devices shall be disassembled and decontaminated following the Wipe/Discard/Wipe protocol . They should be individually dried and placed in sterilization bags that are provided in each operatory. Sealed bags containing instruments are then placed in a collection box located in the hallway. i. Once instruments have been cleaned and bagged, carefully remove all coverings so as not to touch any uncontaminated surfaces. Wipe any areas that are accidentally touched with disinfectant. j. De-glove and carry the \"clean\" cup holding unwrapped ClinAsept film s to the darkroom bare - handed. No darkroom infection control procedures will be needed. k. Before going to the scanner with the exposed PSP sensors, the following protocol should be followed to remove the PSP plastic outer covers: After sensors have been exposed, each having been dried and dropped in a cup, the \"dirty\" cup is placed on a patient napkin. The plastic covering of each sensor is opened gently, letting each uncovered \"clean\" sensor fall into a \"clean\" carry box which is next to (but not on) t he patient napkin. Wrappers are collected on the \"dirty\" patient napkin. The napkin/\"dirty cup\" wrappers are then thrown into the trash case. The carry box of sensors are taken into the digital scanning area bare -handed and opened bare -handed. No new gl oves need to be worn.

Specific written orders are required for imaging the procedures and only are conducted by central radiology faculty and technicians. The division ensures compliance with re quired accreditation standards as stipulated by the Intersocietal Commission on Accreditation of computed tomography. Appendix ( O) includes the UFCD operating policy for CBCT units. 9.19 Staff Training All new clinical staff employees must complete a com prehensive training program that includes the following on-line web based courses: The Bloodborne Pathogen (BBP) and Biomedical Waste (BMW) Management Trainings. An annual update of BBP and BMW training is required by UF Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S). This is completed via the online web -based course or through direct training. Biosafety Training (course number EHS850D) either online, or in person when available. Biosafety Training includes Bloodborne Pathogen and Biomedical Waste training. The Safety Compliance Coordinator handles this program and reports compliance to UF Environmental Health and Safety and the Associate Dean for Clinical Affairs and Quality . 10.0 STERILIZATION, DISINFECTION, AND HAZARDOUS WASTES 10.1 Central Steriliza tion Central sterilization has been utilized by the predoctoral program for many years. The development of the student instrument leasing program in conjunction with the central sterilization program ensures that all instruments are sterilized before patie nt care. The Clinical Manual describes the detailed procedures students must follow to obtain and return their instruments. Instrument processing is done by the Central Sterilization technicians. All instruments and burs used for patient care are leased to the students. Cleaning, packaging, sterilizing, biological monitoring, inventory control and maintenance/replacement of all instruments, burs and handpieces fall under the purview of Central Sterilization in cooperation with the Operations Manager for SMILE (leasing) . Central Sterilization locations and hours are as follows: 1st floor D1 -28 pick -up /7:30 AM - 4:00 PM Monday -Friday 1st floor D1 -29 drop -off/ 7:30 AM -4:00PM Monday -Friday 2nd floor D2 -44 pick -up /7:30 AM - 5:00 PM Monday - Friday 2nd floor D2-28 drop -off/ 7:30 AM - 5:30 PM Monday - Friday 3rd floor D3 -26 pick -up/ 7:30 AM - 12:00 PM & 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM Monday - FridayMon, Tues, Thur, Fri 3rd floor Wednesday AM Closed 1:00 PM -5:00 PM 3rd floor D3 -28 drop -off/ 7:30 AM - 12:00PM & 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM Mon, Tues, Thur, Fri 79 1. Checking out instruments: Present and swipe Gator1 card. a. Instruments will not be checked out without the Gator 1 card b. Students without Gator1 cards must see Leasing Manager immediately c. All items checked out by s tudents are their responsibility d. All routine patient care items must be returned after each AM and PM session e. Students may not check out items using another student's Gator 1 card 2. Check trays and handpieces after obtaining start check from faculty. a. Open packaged equipmen t and locate the indicator strip to assure sterility was achieved. b. If an instrument is broken or missing from a tray, return the tray to sterilization. Notify sterilization staff of broken or missing item(s) and check out another tray. If you do not immedi ately return the tray, notify the staff when the tray is checked back in c. If a handpiece does not work, the entire cassette (all components) must be returned to sterilization before receiving another handpiece . . When returning the handpiece describe to the sterilization tech exactly what is wrong with the handpiece in detail. d. When checking out implant cassettes check to make sure all components are in the cassette using the cassette map provided at checkout 3. Prior to returning the equipment to central ste rilization, the student dentist MUST remove disposable items and dental materials from instrument trays. Examples include but are not limited to: gauze, tofflemire matrix bands, Mylar matrix strips, used steam indicators, bend -a brush, dental floss, and paper products (i.e., cotton rolls, cotton pellets, and paper towels). a. All disposable blades and sharps must be removed from the cassette tray and properly disposed of in the sharps container located in the operatory, prior to returning any tray to steriliza tion. Failure to do so will result in a Professional Variance b. Burs must be removed from handpieces before being returned to sterilization. Failure to do so will result in a Professional Variance. c. Assure all instruments are securely locked in place so they will not poke out the sides and confirm that trays are closed on ALL sides d. Scissors and hemostats that are kept in trays should be open and placed in the clips e. The individual who checked out the equipment from central sterilization is fully responsible for the condition of the returned equipment; therefore, we strongly advise each student personally return equipment they have checked out. f. All components must be in handpiece cassette prior to returning the items to sterilization g. Be sure all other reusable eq uipment and instruments are returned to the appropriate trays h. Ensure that all cassettes and equipment are placed in the instrument carrying bin i. Instrument carrying bin must be disinfected for transport - gloves are not to be worn during transport from oper atory to sterilization j. Do not leave either clean or contaminated instruments in the clinic for any reason k. If a patient does not show for an appointment, please return all items to sterilization on the decontamination side of sterilization immediately. Do not keep instruments for a different patient that may be treated later in the day. l. NOTE: Failure to return instruments in a timely manner will result in a Professional Variance 80 m. Clinical personal protective equipment (PPE) such as cover gowns, or gloves mus t not be worn out of the clinics. If this is worn when retrieving instruments from central sterilization, the clinician will be instructed to remove PPE and perform hand hygiene before being served. 10.2 Disinfectants The following guidelines should be considered in selecting a disinfectant: 1. The disinfectant should be capable of rapidly killing pathogenic organisms, including tubercle bacillus, and be ADA and EPA or FDA approved as appropriate. 2. The disinfectant should not be toxic to human tissues. 3. The d isinfectant should not be destructive to items to be disinfected. 4. The disinfectant should be simple and uncomplicated to use effectively. 5. The disinfectant should be appropriate for the intended purpose. 6. The disinfectant should be reasonably priced.

Pick -up and subsequent disposal is arranged through UF Environm ental Health and Safety Hazardous Materials Handling. Online pick -up requests are available at Online Chemical Waste Pick -up Request 10.4 Dental Mercury Protocol: The primary means by which mercury is absorbed by dental personnel is via inhalation of the vapor from ambient room air. Amalgam scrap and accidental mercury spills in the dental treatment room are sources of potential vapor releases. Other sources in the dental environment include: 1. Removing/polishing amalgam restoration 2. Leaking amalgam capsule 81 3. Faulty amalgamators 4. Capsu les with residual mercury and amalgam 5. Improperly stored mercury and/or amalgam scrap 6. Exposure of mercury or amalgam to heat sources (sterilizers) or warm air To reduce mercury vapor to the lowest possible levels, the following procedures shall be used: 1. Use high volume evacuation and water spray when cutting amalgam, removing old amalgam, or adjusting restorations. The rubber dam is to be placed whenever possible. 2. The amalgamator shall have an enclosure for the capsule and be periodically disassembled to look for and remove accumulated mercury. This will be done by dental assistants and dental maintenance personnel approximately every six months. 3. After dispensing the amalgam, the pestle and empty mercury \"pillow\" shall be replaced in the capsule and the c apsule halves rejoined (closed). The closed capsule shall then be placed in a scrap amalgam container which consists of a white plastic container labeled \"Scrap Amalgam and Amalgam Capsules Only\". 4. All instrument trays shall be thoroughly cleaned and check ed for amalgam scrap before sterilization. 5. Accidental spills shall be immediately reported to Dental Maintenance (273 -8001). A commercially available spill kit is to be used, or a bottle of sulfur or zinc powder is to be spread immediately over any spille d mercury. The residue should be placed in the scrap amalgam container. 6. Always wear gloves, face mask, disposable cover gown, and proper eye protection when working with amalgam. 7. Amalgam carving scrap shall be collected and placed in the scrap amalgam con tainer. 8. Suction traps are to be replaced weekly by dental assistants in each clinic. The used suction traps are to be placed into a Ziploc bag and disinfected with an EPA -registered disinfectant (such as Opticide) then sealed and placed into the amalgam b ucket. 9. Containers shall be stored in each clinic. 10. Amalgam separators have been used to ensure environmental safety and are compliant with effluent limitations guidelines and standards.Are inspected weekly by the dental maintenance team who follow the manuf acturers maintenance and replacement schedule.

The Exposure Control Plan shall be reviewed and updated annually and whenever necessary to reflect new standards to protect the health care worker. The review and updat e of the plan shall reflect changes in technology that eliminate or reduce exposure to bloodborne pathogens, and document consideration and implementation of appropriate commercially available and effective safer medical devices designed to eliminate or mi nimize occupational exposure. UFCD is required to establish an Exposure Control Plan and to solicit input from non -managerial employees responsible for direct patient care who are potentially exposed to injuries from contaminated sharps in the identificati on, evaluation, and selection of effective engineering and work practice controls and shall document the solicitation in the Exposure Control Plan. 1. Definitions a. Engineering and Work Practice Controls: Controls such as sharps containers, safer medical dev ices such as sharps with engineered sharps injury protections and needleless systems, or practices, such as needleless system and safety syringes that isolate, reduce, or remove the risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens in the work place. b. Sharps with Engineered Sharps Injury Protections: A non -needle sharp or needle device used for withdrawing body fluids, accessing a vein or artery, or administering medications or other fluids, with a built -in safety feature or mechanism that effectively reduces the risk of an exposure/incident. c. Needleless Systems: A device that does not use needles for the collection of bodily fluids or withdrawal of body fluids after initial venous or arterial access is established i. The administration of medications or fluids ii. Any other procedure involving the potential for occupational exposure to bloodborne pathogens due to percutaneous injuries from contaminated sharps. iii. Exposure management 2. Record Keeping a. Employee medical records shall be maintained by the UFCD Human Resources for the duration of employment, plus 30 years. b. The UFCD Clinical Quality Improvement Team shall establish and maintain an occupational exposure injury log.

Boyce, M.D.1 Didier Pittet, M.D.2 1Hospital of Saint Raphael New Haven, Connecticut 2University of Geneva Geneva, Switzerland The material in this report originat ed in the National Center for Infectious Diseases, James M. Hughes, M.D., Director; and the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion, Steve Solomon, M.D., Acting Director. Summary The Guideline for Hand Hygiene in Health -Care Settings provides health -care workers (HCWs) with a review of data regarding handwashing and hand antisepsis in health -care settings. In addition, it provides specific recommendations to promote improved hand -hygiene practices and reduce transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to p atients and personnel in health -care settings. This report reviews studies published since the 1985 CDC guideline (Garner JS, Favero MS. CDC guideline for handwashing and hospital environmental control, 1985. Infect Control 1986;7:231 --43) and the 1995 API C guideline (Larson EL, APIC Guidelines Committee. APIC guideline for handwashing and hand antisepsis in health care settings. Am J Infect Control 1995;23:251 --69) were issued and provides an in -depth review of hand -hygiene practices of HCWs, levels of adh erence of personnel to recommended handwashing practices, and factors adversely affecting adherence. New studies of the in vivo efficacy of alcohol -based hand rubs and the 136 HYPERLINK TO THIS FULL DOCUMENT antiseptics, hand lotions or creams, and wearing of artificial fingernails) are also included. Definition of Terms Alcohol -based hand rub. An alcohol -containing preparation designed for application to the hands for reducing the number of viable microorganisms on the hands. In the United States, such preparations usually contain 60% --95% ethanol or isopropanol. Antimicrobial soap Antiseptic agent . Antimicrobial substances that are applied to the skin to reduce the number of microbial flora. Examples triclosan. Antiseptic handwash. Washing hands with water and soap or other detergents containing an antiseptic agent. Antiseptic hand rub . Applying an antiseptic hand -rub product to all surfaces of the hands to reduce the number of microorganisms present. Cumulative effect . A progressive decrease in the numbers of microorganisms recovered after repeated applications of a test material. Decontaminate hands. To Reduce bacterial counts on hands by performing antise ptic hand rub or antiseptic handwash. Detergent . Detergents (i.e., surfactants) are compounds that possess a cleaning action. They are composed of both hydrophilic and lipophilic parts and can be divided into four groups: anionic, cationic, amphoteric, a nd for handwashing or antiseptic handwash in health -care settings represent various types of detergents, the term \"soap\" is used to refer to such detergents in this guideline. Hand antisepsis . Refers to either antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub. Hand hygiene . A general term that applies to either handwashing, antiseptic handwash, antiseptic hand rub, or surgical hand antisepsis. Handwashing . Washing hands with plain (i.e., non -antimicrobial) soap and water. Persistent activity. Persistent activity is defined as the prolonged or extended antimicrobial activity that prevents or inhibits the proliferation or survival of microorganisms after application of the product. This activity may be demonstrated by sampling a site several minutes or hours after application and demonstrating bacterial antimicrobial effectiveness when compared with a baseline level. This property also has been referred to as \"residual 137 activity.\" Both substantive and nonsubstantive a ctive ingredients can show a persistent effect if they substantially lower the number of bacteria during the wash period. Plain soap . Plain soap refers to detergents that do not contain antimicrobial agents or contain low concentrations of antimicrobial agents that are effective solely as preservatives. Substantivity . Substantivity is an attribute of certain active ingredients that adhere to the stratum corneum (i.e., remain on the skin after rinsing or drying) to provide an inhibitory effect on the gro wth of bacteria remaining on the skin. Surgical hand antisepsis . Antiseptic handwash or antiseptic hand rub performed preoperatively by surgical personnel to eliminate transient and reduce resident hand flora. Antiseptic detergent preparations often have persistent antimicrobial activity. Visibly soiled hands. Hands showing visible dirt or visibly contaminated with proteinaceous material, blood, or other body fluids (e.g., fecal material or urine). Waterless antiseptic agent . An antiseptic agent that does not require use of exogenous water. After applying such an agent, the hands are rubbed together until the agent has dried. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) product categories . The 1994 FDA Tentative Final Monograph for Health -Care Antiseptic Drug Products divided products into three categories and defined them as follows ( 19): Patient preoperative skin preparation. A fast -acting, broad -spectrum, and persistent antiseptic -containing preparation that substantially reduces the number of microorganisms on intact skin. Antiseptic handwash or HCW . An antiseptic for frequent use; it reduces the number of microorganisms on intact skin to an initial baseline level after adequate washing, rinsing, and drying; it is bro ad-spectrum, fast - acting, and if possible, persistent. Surgical hand scrub . An antiseptic -containing preparation that substantially reduces the number of microorganisms on intact skin; it is broad -spectrum, fast -acting, and persistent. Part II. Recommendat ions Categories These recommendations are designed to improve hand -hygiene practices of HCWs and to reduce transmission of pathogenic microorganisms to patients and personnel in health -care settings. This guideline and its recommendations are not intended for use in food processing or food -service establishments, and are not meant to replace guidance provided by FDA's Model Food Code. As in previous CDC/HICPAC guidelines, each recommendation is categorized on the basis 138 of existing scientific data, theoreti cal rationale, applicability, and economic impact. The CDC/HICPAC system for categorizing recommendations is as follows: Category IA. Strongly recommended for implementation and strongly supported by well - designed experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies. Category IB. Strongly recommended for implementation and supported by certain experimental, clinical, or epidemiologic studies and a strong theoretical rationale. Category IC. Required for implementation, as mandated by federal or state regul ation or standard. Category II. Suggested for implementation and supported by suggestive clinical or epidemiologic studies or a theoretical rationale. No recommendation. Unresolved issue. Practices for which insufficient evidence or no consensus regar ding efficacy exist. Recommendations 1. Indications for handwashing and hand antisepsis A. When hands are visibly dirty or contaminated with proteinaceous material or are visibly soiled with blood or other body fluids, wash hands with either a non-antimicrobial soap and water or an antimicrobial soap and water (IA) ( 66). B. If hands are not visibly soiled, use an alcohol -based hand rub for routinely decontaminating hands in all other clinical situations described in items 1C --J (IA) (74,93,166,169 ,283,294,312,398 ). Alternatively, wash hands with an antimicrobial soap and water in all clinical situations described in items 1C --J (IB) ( 69-71,74 ). C. (IB) ( 68,400 ). D. Decontaminate hands befor e donning inserting a central intravascular catheter (IB) ( 401,402 ). indwelling urinary catheters, peripheral vascular catheters, or other invasive devices that do not require a surgical procedure ( IB) ( 25,403 ). F. Decontaminate hands after contact with a patient's intact skin (e.g., when taking a pulse or blood pressure, and lifting a patient) (IB) ( 25,45,48,68 ). G. Decontaminate hands or excretions, mucous membranes, nonintact skin, and wound dressings if hands are not visibly soiled (IA) ( 400). H. Decontaminate hands if moving from a contaminated -body site to a clean -body site during patient care (II) ( 25,53 ). I. Decontaminate hands after contact with inanimate objects (inclu ding medical equipment) in the immediate vicinity of the patient (II) ( 46,53,54 ). J. Decontaminate hands after removing gloves (IB) ( 50,58,321 ). 139 K. Before eating and after using a restroom, wash hands with a non -antimicrobial soap and water or with an antimicr obial soap and water (IB) ( 404-409). L. Antimicrobial -impregnated wipes (i.e., towelettes) may be considered as an alternative to washing hands with non -antimicrobial soap and water. Because they are not as effective as alcohol -based hand rubs or washing hands with an antimicrobial soap and water for reducing bacterial counts on the hands of HCWs, they are not a substitute for using an alcohol -based hand rub or antimicrobial soap (IB) ( 160,161 ). M. Wash hands with non -antimicrobial soap and water or with ant imicrobial soap and water if exposure to Bacillus anthracis is suspected or proven. The physical action of washing and rinsing hands under such circumstances is recommended because alcohols, chlorhexidine, iodophors, and other antiseptic agents have against spores (II) ( 120,172, 224,225 ). N. No recommendation can be made regarding the routine use of nonalcohol -based hand rubs for hand hygiene in health -care settings. Unresolved issue. 2. Hand -hygiene technique A. When decontaminating hands with an alcohol -based hand rub, apply product to palm of one hand and rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and fingers, until hands are dry (IB) ( 288,410 ). Follow the manufacturer's recommendations regarding the volume of product to use. When washi ng hands with soap and water, wet hands first with water, apply an amount of product recommended by the manufacturer to hands, and rub hands together vigorously for at least 15 seconds, covering all surfaces of the hands and fingers. Rinse hands with water and dry thoroughly with a disposable towel. Use towel to turn off the faucet (IB) (90-92,94,411 ). Avoid using hot water, because repeated exposure to hot water may increase the risk of dermatitis (IB) ( 254,255 ). Liquid, bar, leaflet or powdered forms of plain soap are acceptable when washing hands with a non -antimicrobial soap and water. When bar soap is used, soap racks that facilitate drainage and small bars of soap should be used (II) ( 412-415). B. Multiple -use cloth towels of the hanging or roll type ar e not recommended for use in health -care settings (II) ( 137,300 ). 3. Surgical hand antisepsis A. Remove rings, watches, and bracelets before beginning the surgical hand scrub (II) (375,378,416 ). B. Remove debris from underneath fingernails using a nail cleaner under running water (II) (14,417 ). C. Surgical hand antisepsis using either an antimicrobial soap or an alcohol -based hand rub with persistent activity is recommended before donning sterile gloves when performing surgical procedures (IB) ( 115,159,232,234,23 7,418 ). 140 D. When performing surgical hand antisepsis using an antimicrobial soap, scrub hands and forearms for the length of time recommended by the manufacturer, usually 2 --6 minutes. Long scrub times (e.g., 10 minutes) are not necessary (IB) ( 117,156,205, 2 07,238 -241). When using an alcohol -based surgical hand -scrub product with persistent activity, follow the manufacturer's instructions. Before applying the alcohol solution, prewash hands and forearms with a non -antimicrobial soap and dry hands and forearm s completely. After application of the alcohol -based product as recommended, allow hands and forearms to dry thoroughly before donning sterile gloves (IB) ( 159,237 141 APPENDIX H : Professional Variance Form Link to Professional Variance Form : Qualtrics Survey | Qualtrics Experience Management 142 APPENDIX I: Patient Information Form 143 Appendix J : Patient Rights & Responsibilities 144 Appendix Dispensed By: Directions to Patient: L: Sequence for Donning PPE 146 APPENDIX M: Budget Payment Agreement 147 APPENDIX N: Essentials of Otaining Proper Consent 148 149 APPENDIX O: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT): Radiation Safety and Operating Policy 150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 APPENDIX P: Mandatory Immunization Health History Form - Health Professions 158 159 APPENDIX Q: UF HEALTH SHANDS CPR TRAINING CENTER AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION COURSE REGISTRATION FORM (form link ) form formatted to fit this page UF HEALTH SHANDS CPR TRAINING CENTER AMERICAN HEART ASSOCIATION COURSE REGISTRATION FORM NAME : ______________________________ CLASS DATE AND TIME: _________________________ CONTACT NUMBER: ____________________ EMAIL: ______________________________________ ALL COURSE FEES MUST BE PAID PRIOR TO TAKING THE COURSE.

Asthma : Acute on chronic exacerbation of reactivity of the pulmonary airway re sulting is difficulty breathing and the development of hypoxia. May be associate with decreased SaO2 and can lead to respiratory collapse. [www.cdc.gov > Asthma > FAQs] Cardiac/Respiratory Arrest: Sudden cardiac death resulting from inadequate perfusion of the cardiac muscle leading to loss of systemic circulation. May be associated directly from a cardiogenic source or from a respiratory systems failure. Hypoglycemia: Blood glucose levels below 70 mgs/dL resulting in altered mental status, heart palpitati ons, shakiness and a general felling of malaise. If severe enough hypoglycemia will lead to loss of consciousness. Hypertension: As recently re -defined by the American Heart association, Adult patients with hypertension have BP's in the range of 130 -139 /80-89 [Stage 1 Hypertension], 140 of greater /90 or greater [Stage 2 Hypertension], 180 or greater systolic and/or greater than 120 diastolic [Hypertensive Crisis]. At UFCD, the parameters for hypertension is defined as 165/95. Pts presenting with elevat ed pressures and systemic symptoms may be classified as requiring urgent or emergent attention. (www.AHA.org, Hypertension ) Pediatric patients with 3 repeated BPs greater than the 95% of age, sex, height norms measured at separate visits or measurements >1 20/80 ( www.Hopkinsmedicine.org , Pediatric Hypertension ) Hypotension: Adult patients with BP less than 90/60. In situations where there are systemic symptoms (chest pain, shortness of breath, altered mental st atus). In Pediatrics : the definition will be according to the formula: systolic BP - <70 + 2 (age in years). Allergic Reactions: Immune mediated hypersensitivity to a pre -processed antigen. When exposed to an allergen the patient first becomes sensitized to the allergen. The body then produces antibodies of the IgE class, which when re -exposed to the allergen binds IgE antibodies causing Mast Cells to release vasoactive amines and other agents of vasoactive chemicals. The bodies response may be delayed an d mild or immediate and severe. Mild responses ( Delayed Hypersensitivity ) may include rashes, wheals and itching. Severe allergic reactions ( Anaphylaxis ) will include multiple systems of the body leading to cardiopulmonary collapse. [www.medlineplus.gov, Allergic Reactions ]. Dyspnea/Shortness of Breath (SOB): A sensation where the patient is subjectively not getting enough air. This condition may be psychosomatic in nature leaving a frightening feeling to the patient or may be a symptom of a more ominous underlying disease process; either chronic or acute. I t is usually associated objectively with a SaO2 of <92% but that may vary depending upon the subjective feelings of the patient. [www.mayoclinics.org, Shortness of Breath ] 161 Seizure: Chaotic neuro -electrical activity that may cause physical symptoms ranging from momentary blank stares to more generalized Tonic -Clonic movements and loss of consciousness. These may be associated with benign physiologic issue (fever, anoxia associated with syncope), head trauma, brain masses or infections or become part of the Epilepsy complex of activity [www.mayoclinic.org, Seizures - Symptoms and causes ] Syncope: The progressive increase in parasympathetic/Vagal tone manifested by bradycardia, hypoperfusion to the cerebral cortex. This leads to a brief loss of consciousness a nd may be associated with excessive perspiration, loss of continence and in some cases, anoxic seizure activity. [https;//my.clevelandclinic.org, Syncope: Symptoms, Causes and Treatments ] Unresponsive patient : When a patient fails to respond to verbal or tactile stimulation, this patient is considered unresponsive. The causes may vary but attention must immediately be directed to the ABC's of evaluation and resuscitation. Intravascular Injection of Local Anesthesia: Can create situations of distal -site nec rosis (if epinephrine is utilized), cause seizure activity or global neurologic inactivity and/or potential cardiovascular collapse. [www.sciencedirect.com, Intravascular Drug Administration - an overview ] Sodium Hypochlorite injection into the Maxillary S inus and Soft Tissues: Sodium Hypochlorite is a very basic (high pH) solution that if injected into the maxillary sinus may cause severe pain, and tissue necrosis of the Schneiderian membrane. If injected into the perioral soft tissues will cause a low pH burn and localized tissue necrosis. Accidental spillage into the eyes will cause tissue injury and possibly corneal damage. As with all toxic agents, the Molar concentration and length of exposure are directly related to the extent of soft tissue injury. [Ehrich DG, et al., JEndod. Sodium hypochlorite accident: inadvertent injection into the maxillary sinus , 1993 PMID:8326264] Foreign body into the eye : Inadvertent deposition of a foreign material into the lid regions of the eye. Associated with a foreign body sensation, pain, excessive tearing and may cause abrasions to the cornea. Agitated patient after injection of Local Anesthesia: IF vital signs are within normal rages for the adult or pediatric patient, these patients may present with agitation due t o several possible causes: intravascular injection, fear/anxiety, hypotension, altered mental status. Swallow/Aspiration of foreign body : The inadvertent loss of control of a tooth, material or instrumentation which passes beyond protective throat screens/ rubber dams. It may be ingested or aspirated. Signs and symptoms may include, foreign body sensation upon swallowing, foreign body sensation in the low oropharynx or acute respiratory distress. "}
