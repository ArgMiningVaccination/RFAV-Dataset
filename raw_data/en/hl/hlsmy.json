[Author: Meg Farris 5:53 PM CDT March 16, 2021 NEW ORLEANS \u2014 In February, preliminary science showed the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine was safe, giving 100 percent protection against severe illness. Now it's under further investigation in Europe, after 37 cases of blood clots, out of the 17 million people who had been vaccinated. So what does this mean if you're trying to decide about getting vaccinated? A number of European countries are temporarily pausing the use of the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine after reports of dangerous blood clots in some people. That vaccine is not yet approved in the U.S., but reports can cause fear about the current vaccines. So we asked Tulane Vaccinologist Dr. Lisa Morici for the vax facts. \"At this point, there's no causal relationship between any of the vaccines and serious adverse events,\" said Dr. Lisa Morici, who is in the Tulane Department of Microbiology and Immunology. Dr. Morici reminds us that millions of people are being vaccinated across the globe. Blood clots can occur for many reasons. The important question to ask now is, is it happening more frequently in people who got the vaccine? \"Right now the reports are that the number of cases are no higher than what you would typically expect in your everyday population,\" she explained. You may remember warnings were announced about reactions in people who have pre-existing severe allergies. There were a few cases in a million. Those are treatable. For now, doctors will carefully examine the new cases of blood clots. When asked, as an expert, if she trusts the system that's in place to find and report any link to the vaccine, she replied, \"I do. There are numerous mechanisms in place for monitoring the safety of these vaccines.\" The concern is, if enough people globally don't get vaccinated, the coronavirus could then infect many, and mutate, causing new variants. She says catching the virus should be feared more than the vaccines. \"Thousand times greater chance of dying from COVID than from getting the vaccine, even if the vaccine could cause death.\" The data from the AstraZeneca vaccine trial in the U.S. should be ready soon, and will be studied very carefully for safety before it is authorized for emergency use. Thursday, The European Union's drug regulatory agency will review the findings on the AstraZeneca vaccine and decide if action needs to be taken. Tulane Microbiology Professor Robert Garry, PhD.

Article By James Gorman - New York Times A small group of scientists and others who believe the novel coronavirus that spawned the pandemic could have originated from a lab leak or accident is calling for an inquiry independent of the World Health Organization's team of independent experts sent to China last month. While many scientists involved in researching the origins of the virus continue to assert that the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic almost certainly began in a leap from bats to an intermediate animal to humans, other theories persist and have gained new visibility with the W.H.O.-led team of experts' visit to China. Officials with the W.H.O. have said in recent interviews that it was \"extremely unlikely\" but not impossible that the spread of the virus was linked to some lab accident....

Garry, a virologist at Tulane University Medical Center, recently posted on the website Virological a report that is not yet peer-reviewed that described new evidence that aspects of the virus that seemed unusual at first had been found in new viruses in Japan, Thailand and Cambodia. He and his co-authors concluded, \"These observations are consistent with the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2 and strongly inconsistent with a laboratory origin.\" He said that he was familiar with some of the views of the letter signers expressed in previous media appearances or on social media, involving speculation about ways the virus could have come from laboratory work, and that none of those views appeared in the letter. Dr. Garry said the possible scenarios described in the letter were that \"the Wuhan Institute of Biology either had SARS-CoV-2 or something very close to it before the outbreak. And for whatever reason, some grand conspiracy, they just didn't want to tell anybody about it.\" Scientists are getting closer to discovering the origins of the novel coronavirus that [sparked the pandemic](https://www.radio.com/kcbsradio/topic/coronavirus-pandemic). \"We've been studying the origin of viruses for a long time,\" said Dr. Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University School of Medicine, who is something of a disease detective. He and his team have been looking for coronaviruses in Southeast Asia mostly in bats to see if they can find the progenitor of the virus that causes COVID-19. Dr. Garry said his team has found several close relatives and are close to finding the virus' direct ancestor. \"By comparing these viruses, looking for different signatures - we call them signature motifs, different parts of the virus proteins - we can start to piece together how a virus like SARS-CoV-2 could have evolved,\" he explained. \"We need to find out what other SARS-like viruses are out there so we can be much better prepared the next time. We don't want another pandemic like this to happen.\" As an expert in the origin of viruses, Dr. Garry said there is no truth to the [conspiracy theories](https://www.radio.com/kcbsradio/topic/conspiracy-theories) that the novel coronavirus may have been created in a lab as a bio weapon. \"There's no reason to think that investigators in China had any viruses anywhere close to SARS-CoV-2 or knew about it before the outbreak happened.\" Author: Meg Farris (WWL) NEW ORLEANS \u2014 We were curious about some stories that came out in the news after people were vaccinated against COVID. One was why did Mayor Cantrell have a positive test after her vaccine. And another is why do some people still get a mild case after being fully vaccinated. Last week Mayor LaToya Cantrell was denied access to the White House after getting a positive result from a coronavirus test. \"Upon taking that, they gave me a call and said that I had tested positive and I'm like, 'Oh no, I've never tested positive,'\" Mayor LaToya Cantrell said. Shortly afterward she had two more tests that were negative. She had just gotten her first dose COVID vaccine two days earlier. Did that make a difference? \"Getting the vaccine will not give you a false positive test,\" said Dr. Bob Garry, Tulane Microbiologist and Immunologist. Dr. Garry said the PCR tests the mayor had are more than 98 percent accurate. He suspects it was a false positive. \"This apparently is what happened to the mayor. She just happened to be in that unlucky one percent where the test gave a false result,\" he explained. Another question is why are we seeing headlines like the one out of Oregon, where four people tested positive and some have mild symptoms after full vaccine immunity? We know the vaccine does not give you the virus, and the current ones are 95 percent effective. \"That is not 100 percent. You know five people out of 100 are going to get infected and there, the vaccines are going to keep you from getting a severe illness,\" said Dr. Garry. So the vaccines will not necessarily keep you from getting infected when you're exposed to the virus. \"You might just replicate the virus enough to make the test come up positive, but you're either going to be asymptomatic or have very mild illness.\" \"Hopefully, when all of us get the vaccine and we drive this virus into the ground, you know, then there won't be a need for masking and social distancing anymore,\" said Dr. Garry. And with vaccine supplies ramping up, that could come sooner than later. The PCR COVID test that the mayor had is not the rapid test, which is not quite as accurate as the PCR test. People throw beads from a balcony on Royal Street during Mardi Gras in the French Quarter in New Orleans, Feb. 25, 2020 Staff Photo by Sophia Germer for Nola.com Public health officials have largely accepted that last year's Mardi Gras helped make New Orleans an early coronavirus hotspot in the U.S., even if a lack of testing made it hard to be sure. But a new study that sought to pinpoint how the virus spread through the city has found that 2020 Carnival revelry was responsible for tens of thousands of coronavirus cases, after a single person likely brought it to New Orleans in the weeks before Mardi Gras. Researchers at the Scripps Research Institute, Tulane University, LSU Health Shreveport and several other institutions said in a pre-publication report released Monday that the coronavirus probably arrived in New Orleans about two weeks before Fat Tuesday, likely from a person traveling from Texas.

Photo by Paula Burch-Celentano. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is rapidly evolving as COVID-19 spreads across the globe. Tulane Microbiology Professor Robert Garry, PhD, is part of a national team of leading virologists who are sequencing coronavirus samples to monitor mutations. He spoke with Tulanian Now about what the new variants mean for transmission and how they may impact the next phase of the pandemic. Q: What do we need to know about the new COVID-19 variants? Robert Garry: We have three or four variants now circulating around the world. The one that most people recognize is the United Kingdom variant, known as B.1.1.7. It spreads easier than the other variants, but it is not more pathogenic. It doesn't cause increased symptoms or illness. And, so far, there is no evidence it causes increased deaths. Now, the fact that you've got it spreading easier, means you're going to have more people infected. And that ultimately will result in more people in the hospital and more deaths. But, individually speaking, if you're infected with that variant, it's no worse than the ones that are currently most prevalent. Q: How common is the U.K. variant in the United States right now and do you expect it to become the dominant strain here? It is not prominent yet. We don't have good numbers, unfortunately, because the United States is behind other countries in terms of the amount of sequencing that we're doing. Once it gets a toehold in, it will start to take off. But that's going to take several weeks to several months. Q: Should we change our behavior because of the new variant? Yes. We have to double down on those protections that everybody has been talking about \u2014 social distancing and wearing a good mask. Wear the best mask you can. If you can get your hands on a KN95 or an N95 that's properly fitted, that's the kind of mask you want to wear. If you can't get one of those, multiple layers of cloth will do in terms of keeping the virus out of your lungs and keeping you from expelling it to other people so they can't get infected.

What should we know about the vaccines that you worked on? What we really work on are things called adjuvants, things you add to vaccines to make them work better. Just think Tony Chachere's\u2014it makes everything you put it on a little bit better. Well, that's what adjuvants do, they amplify the body's immune response to a vaccine's antigens. Q. The adjuvants you work on can improve access to vaccines by helping to reduce the amount of antigens needed in vaccines or allowing them to be delivered differently? Yes. Our primary focus is vaccines against diarrheal diseases for children in developing countries. These diseases do not affect children in developed countries, so they are not attractive targets for large pharmaceutical companies. Along with numerous other organizations, we explore novel ways to develop low-cost, safe, effective vaccines for these children. Q: I'm told you enjoy mentoring. Junior investigators are always asking questions that I would not have thought to ask. The answers allowed us to move forward in directions that I would not have moved on my own. Betzi Norton and Jacob Bitoun in our department will continue working on the same things that I'm working on now, in their own way. It's a natural progression.

The Scripps Research Institute will lead the effort via the newly created Center for Viral Systems Biology (CViSB), which includes researchers from Tulane University School of Medicine, Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone, the University of California, Los Angeles, the Ragon Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The new project builds on more than a decade of highly collaborative work in Sierra Leone, West Africa, where scientists and local partners have built research facilities and worked with patients. \"Coupling the powerful tools of systems biology research with the resources built up over the past fifteen years in West Africa will allow important advances in our understanding of Ebola and Lassa fever, two of the deadliest diseases known,\" said Robert Garry, PhD, co-director of the new center and professor of microbiology at Tulane. While Ebola virus outbreaks are rare, the 2013-2016 epidemic in West Africa infected more than 15,000 people, killing more than 10,000. Lassa virus causes recurring outbreaks in West Africa, killing thousands of people a year. \"These are very severe diseases, but some people survive. So the simple question is 'Why?' How are some people able to fight off the disease, while others are not?\" said CViSB co-director Kristian Andersen, PhD, director of Infectious Disease Genomics at the Scripps Translational Science Institute. Researchers will use genomic analysis and other advanced tools, including physiological measurements, to study individual disease survivors. They will also develop predictive statistical models for identifying critical disease correlates and analyze large-scale data sets to pinpoint causal host-pathogen interactions. By shedding light on the molecular networks that play critical roles in patient outcomes, the research will allow scientists to identify new targets for medicines and vaccines and inform personalized treatment strategies. \"This is different from a lot of research where we are looking at the outbreaks as a whole,\" Andersen said. \"In this research, instead we're zooming in on the individual patient to learn how we can best treat and prevent these diseases in the future.\" WATCH: Tulane's proposal for the MacArthur Foundation's 100&Change grant was named a \"Best Bet\" by one of the nation's leading philanthropic research centers. A Tulane University proposal to establish a comprehensive system of infectious disease response, from early detection to the development of new treatments, has been named a \"Best Bet\" by one of the nation's leading philanthropic research centers. The Center for High Impact Philanthropy (CHIP), which is widely recognized as a trusted source of knowledge and education to help donors do more good, sees great potential in a Tulane plan to combat infectious diseases, like Ebola and Zika, before they burst onto the world stage in the form of epidemics. The recognition by the University of Pennsylvania-based CHIP shines a light on deserving proposals that the MacArthur Foundation, a leading supporter of nonprofits, cannot fund but hopes others will. Tulane was one of 1,904 institutions and groups that submitted proposals for the MacArthur Foundation's 100&Change grant, which awards $100 million to a single project that can make measurable progress toward solving a significant problem. CHIP analyzed MacArthur's top applications and identified 11 \"Best Bets\" that didn't get the big prize but have the greatest potential for impact. Tulane's proposal centered on developing processes to quickly respond to emerging disease threats by creating a seamless \"detection to production\" system. \"Our solution is to establish an efficient and adaptable system able to identify potential infectious disease threats and quickly develop novel diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines, which are critical to stopping the spread of diseases in a timely fashion,\" John Clements, professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane School of Medicine, wrote in the grant proposal. CHIP noted that Tulane's proposal was a particularly bold idea worth funding given the combined resources of its schools of Medicine, Public Health and Tropical Medicine and Science and Engineering, as well as its National Primate Research Center, Biodiversity Research Center and affiliated clinical trials units. CHIP's recommendation also highlighted Tulane's long history of infectious disease research and prevention. \"[Tulane's] team of scientists from across the university's multiple schools, and its past involvement in infectious disease prevention represent unique competencies that the team brings,\" says CHIP's Bold Ideas guide. \"In addition, Tulane suggests that the processes it develops will be shared and could eventually be replicated at other institutions.\" \"If Tulane is successful in streamlining the process of diagnosing and developing treatment and vaccines for infectious disease and minimizing the response time to an outbreak, loss of life could be dramatically reduced.\" If you would like more information about supporting this project, contact Melissa Ereckson at [merekson@tulane.edu](mailto:merekson@tulane.edu). Story by Katy Reckdahl October 13, 2017 James Robinson and Robert Garry have tracked the Lassa virus for more than a decade. Twelve years ago, Robert Garry first suggested that his team at Tulane University School of Medicine could unlock the secrets of the mysterious Lassa virus. Some researchers were skeptical. \"They thought it was too difficult,\" Garry said. For starters, the trip from the closest airport to Tulane's partners at the Kenema Government Hospital in Sierra Leone took 13 hours, driving over treacherously bumpy dirt roads. Tulane would have to draw blood samples from Lassa survivors at a lab in southern Nigeria and the hospital in Kenema, freeze the samples, then keep them frozen for another long bumpy ride and a trans-Atlantic flight to New Orleans. Once those practical concerns were overcome, Tulane researchers were faced with a virus that science knew very little about in 2005. \"This virus was an enigma,\" said Garry's longtime colleague, Dr. James Robinson, a professor of pediatrics. \"We knew it occurred and that people either died or got better.\" \"Before we started, no one knew what the proteins of Lassa virus looked like,\" said Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology. \"We knew little about how the immune system responded to the virus. And we didn't know if our tests would work.\" A few years ago, the Tulane team grieved and suffered setbacks after Kenema's hospital became ground zero for an explosive outbreak of Ebola virus, a highly contagious hemorrhagic fever whose initial symptoms look similar to Lassa in patients. Despite protective gear, 11 of the hospital's staff were infected; several died, including the chief nurse and the doctor in charge of the Lassa fever program. This article appeared first in the September 2017 issue of Tulane magazine. [Continue to full article.](https://news.tulane.edu/news/hunt-lassa-fever-cure) September 05, 2017 Story by Keith Brannon Tulane University School of Medicine virologists Dr. James Robinson (left) and Robert Garry are part of the research team that developed human monoclonal antibodies for a new Lassa fever therapy. An experimental therapy using cloned antibodies from Lassa fever survivors was 100 percent effective in stopping the progression of the deadly disease in nonhuman primates up to eight days after infection, according to a new study in Nature Medicine. The research, conducted by a collaborative team led by University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston, tested Arevirumab-3, a cocktail of human monoclonal antibodies developed by Tulane University and Zalgen Labs LLC. Lassa fever is a severe and often fatal hemorrhagic illness caused by Lassa virus. It infects more than 300,000 annually. Women and children are in the highest risk groups for the disease, which is often hard to detect in early stages because initial symptoms are similar to the flu and other common illnesses. \"The fact that Arevirumab-3 was 100 percent effective in rescuing primates more than a week after infection with Lassa virus suggests that this therapy may benefit patients with Lassa fever in West Africa, who often present to the clinic at a late stage of disease,\" said virologist Robert Garry, professor of microbiology and immunology at Tulane University School of Medicine. \"We are accelerating further development of Arevirumab-3 so that this promising treatment can be deployed into clinics where it is needed most.\" This summer, the National Institutes of Health awarded Tulane $5.7 million to further test and refine the antibody-based treatment to get it ready for clinical trials. Tulane was also awarded $6.32 million to develop a Lassa vaccine. The vaccine will test antibodies that target a recently identified viral surface structure, called the surface glycoprotein, which can block it from infecting a host cell. Tulane researchers have been studying Lassa in West Africa with a team of collaborators for more than 14 years. They have developed a rapid test to diagnose the disease in the field and spent years collecting blood samples from survivors to identify critical antibodies against the virus. Tulane University School of Medicine is now a Center of Excellence in the Global Virus Network (GVN), a organization of leading medical virologists from 25 countries decidated to fighting pandemic viral threats through collaborative research, training and advocacy. Dr. Robert Garry Dr. Robert Garry, professor of microbiology and immunology, will lead Tulane's GVN Center of Excellence, which will focus on building research capacity to respond to emerging viral threats in West Africa, an area that recently experienced the deadliest outbreak of Ebola. Tulane also leads the Viral Hemorrhagic Fever Consortium (VHFC), a public-private partnership of scientists who are developing countermeasures, including diagnostics, immunotherapeutics and vaccines, against Lassa virus, Ebola and Marburg viruses, flaviviruses (including Zika virus) and several other high consequence pathogens. \"Given their breadth and deep expertise in viruses, particularly hemorrhagic viruses, Tulane will be an excellent resource for the GVN,\" said Robert Gallo, GVN co-founder and scientific director. \"Bob Garry's ability to establish successful public-private partnerships, such as the VHFC, to help bring lab research to the clinic, particularly in the field of diagnostics, will be a tremendous boost to the GVN.\" Garry helped pioneer a rapid test for Ebola and is now working on diagnostics for Zika virus. \"We look forward to joining the GVN so that we can better foster infrastructure development, research, training and education on detection, prevention, amelioration, and treatment of viral hemorrhagic fever viruses targeting both the scientific and general communities,\" Garry said. \"We have a significant presence in West Africa and are pleased to extend our global reach through the GVN.\" The GVN is a global authority and resource for the identification, investigation, interpretation, control and suppression of viral diseases posing threats to mankind. It addresses a global need for coordinated virology training, developing scholarly exchange programs for recruiting and training young scientists in medical virology. It also serves as a resource to governments and international organizations seeking advice about viral disease threats, prevention or response strategies. "}
