Biomed Pharmacother ; 133: | ID: covidwho-1059801 ABSTRACTCOVID-19 is a global [pandemic], with over 50 million confirmed cases and 1.2 million deaths as of November 11, 2020. No [therapies]or [vaccines]so far are recommended to treat or prevent the new [coronavirus]. A novel [traditional Chinese medicine]formula, [Taiwan]Chingguan Yihau (NRICM101), has been administered to [patients]with COVID-19 in [Taiwan]since April 2020. Its clinical outcomes and [pharmacology]have been evaluated. Among 33 [patients]with confirmed COVID-19 admitted in two medical centers, those (n = 12) [who]were older, sicker, with more co-existing conditions and showing no improvement after 21 days of [hospitalization]were given NRICM101. They achieved 3 consecutive [negative results]within a median of 9 days and reported no adverse events. Pharmacological assays demonstrated the effects of the formula in inhibiting the spike [protein]/ACE2 interaction, 3CL [protease]activity, viral necrosis factor](TNF)-. may disrupt [disease progression]through its [antiviral]and anti-inflammatory properties, offering promise as a multi-target agent for the prevention and [treatment]of COVID-19.
