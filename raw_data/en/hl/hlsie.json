Dr. Garg completed his bachelors in chemistry at the University of Chicago, followed by MD-PhD training in the Harvard-MIT combined program. His dissertation work utilized small regulatory RNA molecules to study cellular interactions in the immune system. Following clinical training in laboratory medicine and molecular genetic pathology, Dr. Garg completed postdoctoral fellowship with Phillip Sharp at MIT. Dr. Garg started his laboratory as a clinical fellow at MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, and the Garg lab moved to Yale University in the fall of 2022. Dr. Garg is interested in how non-genetic changes arise naturally in cell populations, particularly in the contexts of development and cancer. The Garg lab studies how small RNAs and other gene regulatory events contribute to these non-genetic differences between cells, influencing their behavior, and how this information can be applied to build novel cancer diagnostics. Approaches include tools from RNA biology, cell biology, genomics, machine learning, and data science. https://www.garglab.org Education & Training - Clinical InvestigatorMassachusetts Institute of Technology (2022) - Postdoctoral FellowMassachusetts Institute of Technology (2017) - ResidentMassachusetts General Hospital (2016) - FellowHarvard Medical School (2015) - MDHarvard Medical School, Health, Sciences, and Technology (2012) - PhDHarvard Medical School, Immunology (2012) - BSUniversity of Chicago, Biochemistry (2003) - MSUniversity of Chicago, Chemistry (2003) Departments & Organizations [Center for RNA Science and Medicine](https://medicine.yale.edu/rnacenter/) [Genomics, (PTB) [Yale Cancer Center](https://www.yalecancercenter.org/) [Yale Combined Program Biological "}
