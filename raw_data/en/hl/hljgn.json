It exemplifies the rigor, autonomy, and pride with which MGH medical residents approach their work and their training. The Whi te Book is comprised of a collective of clinical experiences on the medical services as well as an annual review of the literature. This book is a product of diligent work of many resident contributors (listed on the bottom of each page) as well as past generations of authors and editors. We exten d our sincere gratitude to those junior and senior residents who contributed significant time and energy in editing entire sections of this manual: Cardiology : Rachel Frank, Avanthi Raghavan, Sam uel Slavin Endocrinology : Alexandra Wick Pulmonology & Critical Care : Shelsey Sneha Psychiatry : Fiona Gispen, John Weems Infectious Disease : Ali Castle, Christian Larsen Primary Care : Andrew Hoekzema , Margaret Threadgill Hematology : Jackie Henson, Vinayak Venkataraman Consultants : Melissa Lumish Oncology : Lauren Miller Procedures : Chris Kearney, Paige McLean Rheumatology : Louise Xu In ad dition, we would like to thank the many faculty who assisted with this book. Multi ple sections have had significant updates and there are many new articles including: Cardiology - Mechanical Support & Transplant, Peripheral Artery Disease, Cardio -Oncology; Infectious Disease - Head & Neck Infections, Sexually Transmitted Infections, Travel Medicine; Geriatrics & Palliative Care - Non Pain Symptom Management, Advanced Care Planning; Endocrinology - Osteoporosis; Allergy & Immunology - Common Allergic Disorders; Psychiatry - Agitation, Psychosis; Primary Care - Decision Aids. Ou r work would not be possible without the countless hours of work by the previous editors of the MGH Department of Medicine Housestaff Manual. We hope we have lived up to their example: 1994 Albert Shaw & Ravi Tha dhani 1995 Barry Kitch 1996 Sam Hahn 1998 Marc Sabatine 2000 Sherri -Ann Burnett & Bill Lester 2001 Jose Florez 2003 Andrew Yee 2004 Ishir Bhan 2005 Aaron Baggish & Yi-Bin Chen 2006 Bobby & Eugene Rhee 2007 Rajeev Malhotra 2008 Maha Farhat & W.

In particular, we extend special thanks to Gabby Mills, Libby Cunningham, and Paula Prout for support ing this project. In addition, we would like to thank our Chief Residents - Emily Walsh, Daniel Restrepo , Nino Mihatov, and Nancy Haff for their undying support and sage wisdom. Finally, we are very grateful to Jay Vyas, Hasan Bazari, and Katrina Armstrong for their endless devotion to housestaff education. It has be en an incredible honor to edit The White Book. We look forward to the contributions of future generations of authors and editors in the years to come. Meli ssa Lumish, MD & Shilpa Sharma, MD Department of Medicine, Massachusetts General Hospital June 2019 As with any other medical reference, this manual is NOT intended to provide specific clinical care decisions in an individual case, and should NOT substitute for clinical judgment. Every clinical care decision must be made by the exercise of professional judgment by the individual responsible for the care of a patient based on the facts of that individual case, which may differ from the facts upon which entries in this manual are based. You should con sult other references and your fellow residents, fellows, and attendings whenever possible. We have carefully inspected every page, but errors may exist. If you find any errors, we would appreciate it if you would inform next year's editors to make sure these errors are corrected.

Always note: rate, rhythm, QRS axis, complexes and intervals, chamber enlargement, ischemia/infarction, compare with prior EKG Rate (atrial, ventricular) If the rhythm is regular, use the counting method (300 / # large boxes). See image at right. If the rhythm is irregular, count R waves in the rhythm strip and multiply by 6 (EKG printouts record 10 seconds) Normal 60- 100bpm; <60bpm is bradycardia, >100bpm is tachycardia Rhythm (regular or irregular; sinus vs. non- sinus ) Sinus rhythm defined as: P before every QRS, regular w/ rate 60- 100, P wave upright I, II, aVF, V5 -6 P wave s/morphology : Determine (1) If a P wave is present (best leads to visualize P wave are II and V1) (2) The atrial rate in II and biphasic in V1) QRS morphology complex association: If not 1:1 association, determine if number of P>QRS (AV block) or P<QRS (accelerated junctional or ventricular rhythm) . If P precedes QRS, evaluate the PR interval . If P after QRS, evaluate the RP interval and determine if PR or RP interval is fixed or variable QRS Axis Normal axis ( -30 to 90\u00ba): QRS complex is positive (upright) in leads I and II Leftward axis ( -30 to -90\u00ba): QRS complex is positive in lead I but negative in lead II Ddx: normal variant, mechanical shifts, MI Rightward axis (90 to 180\u00ba) : QRS complex is negative in lead I and positive in leads II, aVF Ddx: normal variant, mechanical shifts, WPW, causes RAD) Extreme axis deviation/ northwest axis ( 180 to -90\u00ba): QRS complexes negative in both I and II Ddx: Lead transposition, ventricular ectopic rhythms, hyperkalemia, (i.e. \"R wave progression\") : R wave amplitude typically increases from V1 to V5, with transition of R>S in amplitude at V3 or V4 . CCW : to V3 due to RVH, WPW, LAFB, posterior MI. CW occurs due to cardiomyopathy, LVH, LBBB, anterior MI . Both CW and CCW rotation are nonspecific and can be normal (Am Heart J 2004;148:80 ) Low voltage: Average QRS amplitude < 5 mm in I, II, III and < 10 mm in precordial anasarca Complexes and Intervals (Circ 2009;119:e241) P wave : Right and left atrial depolarization; normal duration <120ms PR interval : Atrial node and His -Purkinje conduction. Normally 140- 200ms, changes with rate (shortened at faster rates, longer at lower rates due to autonomic effects on AV nodal conduction) QRS : Ventricular depolarization. Normal duration 60- 100ms, not influenced by HR. QRS 100 -120ms is seen with incomplete BBB delay (IVCD) ; >120ms represents BBB, activation (PVC, VT, fusion beats, WPW, beats), hyperK, Na channel poisoning, aberrancy , hypothermia ST-segment : Represents a time of electrical silence. See \"Ischemia/Infarction \" on next page T-wave : Ventricular repolarization, with a slow upstroke and a rapid return to the isoelectric line after peaking. Usually asymmetric and in the same direction as the QRS. Should have smooth contours (bumps in T are usually buried P waves) U wave : occurs in the same direction as T wave, rate- dependent (shorter at faster rates); ddx : and repolarization. Excludes U -wave unless fused with the T wave. Rate -dependent (shortened at faster rates). Normal <440ms in men, <460ms in women Chamber Enlargement (Circ S in V1+ 35mm OR R in aVL 11mm.

Common, nonspecific. LPFB : Right axis deviation (0 to +90) w/ QRS<120. No alternate reason (e.g., RVH, emphysema, lateral MI, PE). Rare to see in isolation, usually occurs with RBBB. Bifascicular block : RBBB with either LAFB or ) T -waves can be found within minutes ; followed by T wave inversions (0.1 mV in 2 contiguous leads) ST depression : Suggests subendocardial injury; 0.05 mV below the baseline (PR segment ), measured at the J point, in two contiguous leads, downsloping or horizontal = more ominous . ST depressions do not localize to territories (Circ Res 1998;82;957 ) NB: always look for ST elevations to rule out reciprocal ST depression. Digoxin toxicity: scooping ST depressions. ST elevation : Suggests transmural ischemia; 0.1 mV, except for leads V2 to V3 (0.2 mV in men 40yo and 0.15 mV in women), measured at the J point . PR segment is the isoelectric interval on the ECG and can be used to assess ST segment elevation/depression. Q-wave: Usually a marker of scar; must be deep (>1 mm) and broad (>0.04 seconds), more likely 2/2 prior MI if inverted T wave in same lead. Pathologic Q wave defined by 40ms duration (1 box wide) , 25% height of QRS (non -pathologic) . Sgarbossa Criteria: Used to diagnose acute MI in presence of LBBB.

Step 3 : correct underlying causes or precipitants whenever possible ( e.g. IVF) . Long- Term Rate vs. Rhythm Control Overall, rate control noninferior to rhythm control for AF symptoms, CV mortality, if systolic dysfxn). Restoration of NSR may also lead to in achieving rate control (70% vs. 54%), either alone or in combination with digoxin. Digoxin alone is moderately effective in controlling V -rate at rest, ineffective during exertion or high adrenergic tone . Long -term digoxin independently associated with increased mortality in AF patients (JACC 2018;71:1063 ). Rate T argets: Lenient rate control (resting HR <110 ) non- inferior to strict rate control (HR <80); similar outcomes in CV death, stroke, bleeding, arrhythmia and hospitalization for HF (RACE II ). Stricter HR ( or rhythm control ) may be beneficial in younger pts or pts w/ HF. Contraindications/Warnings: Evidence of pre -excitation on E CG (in these patients, IV procainamide is 1st line), cautious use in high -degree AVB. CCA should not be used in pts with EF<40% given negative inotropy. \"Pill-in- Pocket\": For pts w recent pAFib w infrequent and well -tolerated episodes, ppx may have risk>benefit, and thus prn flecainide or propafenone sx onset is safe and effective ( NEJM 2004;351:23 84). Long- Term Rhythm Control : Overview (Circulation 2012;125:381 ) Choice of Agents : oNo structural ablation vein isolation): associated with a lower long- term AF recurrence rate vs. antiarrhythmic agents in both paroxysmal ( MANTRA -PAF, RAAFT -2) and persistent A F (Eur Heart J 2014;35:501 ).

Edoxaban 60mg QD CrCl <30 Noninferior to warfarin for prevention of stroke with lower rates of major bleeding and death (ENGAGE -AF). NOACs vs Warfarin: In meta- analysis , NOACs shown to have lower risk of stroke or systemic embolic events (RR 0.81 ), all-cause mortality ( RR 0.9 ), and ICH (RR 0.48) but higher risk of GI bleeding (RR 1.25) compared to warfarin ( Lancet 2014;383:955 ). In new AF, start a valvular (see below) (Eur Heart J 206;37:2893 ). Bridging AC: Consider bridging with mechanical (Circulation 2014;130:2071 device) : In non- valvular AFib, device placement provides comparable stroke prevention to warfarin w ith reduced bleeding risk and improved mortality (JACC 2017;70:2964 ).

Atrial Flutte r Overview Less prevalent but often coexists or precedes AF . Type 1 (typical): Reentrant loop in RA via cavo- tricuspid isthmus (CTI). Divided based on direction of circuit: Counterclockwise (more common, inverted flutter waves in II, III, aVF + upright flutter waves in V1) Clockwise (less common, upright flutter waves in II, III, aVF + inverted flutter waves in V1) Type 2 (atypical): does not meet criteria for Type 1; is typically faster and often refractory to ablation Anticoagulation: Risk of thromboembolism lower than AF (J Stroke Cerebrovasc 2018;27:839 ) but these are small studies - management should be similar to AF (Chest 2012;141:e531S ). Rate control : Similar strategies (BB,CC A) to AF, but more difficult to successfully rate -control . Rhythm control : CTI ablation for (prolonged QTc >450 ms in men; >470 ms in women) Measure from beginning of QRS to end of T wave in a lead with T- wave > 2mm ; define end point using tangent from peak of steepest slope to isoelectric line QTc - Corrected for HR o Bazett 's formula = QT/ RR; overcorrects at high HR and undercorrects at low HR o Fridericia's formula = QT/3RR; more accurate at high or low HR (Am J Cardiol 1993 26;72:17B ).

TAVR is recommended for those at extreme surgical risk (compared to medical therapy ; PARTNER ). TAVR is noninferior to SAVR in those at intermediate ( PARTNER 2 , surgical risk with interim data ( NOTION ) suggesting that TAVR may be non- inferior to SAVR in low -risk patients but longterm follow -up required. Valve -in-valve TAVR may additionally be beneficial in pts with surgical bioprosthetic AV failure ( JACC 2017;69:2283 w/ CABG appropriate. If other valve/aortic disease can be simultaneously fixed by cardiac surgery, SAVR is indicated. TAVR Evaluation: Consult access site Medical Management : Treat hypertension: reduces the \"double load\" on the ventricle; however, no optimal regimen exists because many anti - hypertensives can lead to hemodynamic issues (diuretics reduce preload which lead to decrease CO, vasodilators can reduce coronary artery perfusion, BB can reduce needed contractility).

More recently, organ dysfunction has been quantified using the Sequenti al Organ Fail ure Assessment (SOFA) score.

C omponents of initial management include: (1) administering broad spectrum empiric antibiotics within 1 hour of diagnosis (2) initial fluid resuscitation with a 30 mL/kg fluid challenge over 3 hours (+ more as needed if patient is volume- responsive) (3) vasopressor support if needed (4) so urce identification and control 1)Antibiotics: ***Antibiotics should be administered , not just ordered, within one hour of recognition. Order STAT .*** Broad, empiric intravenous antibiotics must be started within one hour (CCM 2010;38:1045 ). Rapid administration of antibiotics is associated with lower in -hospital mortality (NEJM 2017;376:2235 ); increase in mortality of 7.6% per hour delay in adequate antimicrobial administration ( CCM 2006;34:1589 ) Antibiotic selection should be guided by old micro data and exposures (SNF, lines, recent antibiotic use, MDROs, etc) Consider double coverage of GNRs if: (1) immunocompromised (2) healthcare exposures in prior 3-6mo (3) p seudomonal infection in prior 3- 6mo (4) institutional prevalence GNRs >20% ( Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2005;49:760 ). Data for this practice is mixed but recent cohort studies showed benefit w ith anti -pseudomonal beta- lactam Chemother ) If there is suspicion of toxic shock syndr ome, add clindamycin for anti -toxin effects and staph/strep coverage 2) Resuscitation : Initial fluid challenge is minimum of 30 mL/kg of crystalloid administered over 3 hours Balanced crystalloids (e.g., LR), compared to NS associated with lower mortality and less renal impairment (NEJM 2018;378:829 ) After the initial resuscitation effort, further fluid administration should be guided by dynamic measures of fluid responsiveness : Assessing for Fluid Responsiveness Techniques and Monitors Fluid Responsive if: Sn Sp Clinical/Lab Assessments : BP, mental PPV ( PPmax -PPmin/PPmean ) in patients mechanically vented with tidal volumes of 8 mL/kg or 45\u00b0 w/ supine torso x 1 min. in a mechanically ventilated patient (less accurate if spontaneous respirations) in pulse pressure 12% 60% 85% Ultrasound collapsibility : bolus and then immediately after. *Note that static CVP measurement alone is poor predictor of volume responsiveness suggest s adequate volume challenge No response to volume challenge suggests patient is on the flat part of the Frank -Starling curve ; consider vasopressors instead Consider a lbumin when patients require crystalloid; meta- analysis showed trend toward decreased mortality in septic shock (CCM 2014;18:702 )qSOFA 1.

Get at least 2 sets of BCx (both aerobic and anaerobic bottles), with at least one drawn percutaneously. Evaluate early for conditions that would require emergent source control ( e.g., necrotizing soft tissue infections, peritonitis, cholangitis, intestinal infarctions , abscess, obstructive renal stone blood for fungemia. Imaging studies: F ailure to improve on broad spectrum antibiotics should prompt eval uation for an occult source CONTINUING MANAGEMENT Antibiotics: Attempt to narrow within 48 hours, ideally guided by culture data + sensitivities and clinical improvement Duration of therapy should typically be 7-10 days; longer courses in patients w/ slow clinical response, foci , bacteremia, S. aureus som e infections , or immunologic deficiencies (e.g., neutropenia) Procalcitonin levels can inform decision to discontinue a ntibiotics or shorten course ( Lancet Inf Dis 2016;16:819; PRORATA trial, Lancet 2010;375:463 ) Resuscitation: Overall conservative fluid management results in faster recovery in ARD S (FACTT trial, NEJM 2006;354:2564 ) Transfusion: No evidence to support transfusion goal higher than hgb 7 g/dl unless cardiac ischemia, hemorrhage, page Renal D ysfunction: CVVH and HD are largely equivalent for treating AKI, but CVVH can help minimize fluid shifts in hem odynamically unstable patients. Can consider early renal consult for RRT in patients with refractory acidosis, though recent data suggests no mortality benefit to early (<12h) versus delayed (>48h) initiation of RRT in patients with septic shock and AKI -dependent contractilit y (NEJM 2014;371:2309 ) Traditionally lactic acidosis ( CHEST 2000;117:260 ) In patients BICAR showed benefit with infusion of 125 -250ml 2% IV bicarb over 30 min with max of 1000ml in 24h (Lancet 2018;392:31 ), goal pH >7.30 CONTROVERSIAL MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES Corticosteroids : An initial study suggested a mortality benefit for corticosteroids in patients with septic shock (\"Annane\" or French trial, JAMA 2002;288:862 ). Patients were randomized to placebo or hydrocortisone + fludrocortisone x 7d. ICU mortality, 28- day mortality, and in-hospital mortality were significantly improved compared to placebo. The same author showed similar results in a recent study (NEJM 2018;378:809 ). Controversy: Findings were not replicated in recent other groups (CORTICUS , HYPRESS , and ADRENAL ). Key points: hydrocortisone for patients in whom fluids and pressors do not restore hemodynamic stability. Note that cortisol measurements are not adequate predictors of response to steroids in ICU patients, and that etomidate (used by RICU for rapid sequence intubation) directly inhibits adrenal steroid biosynthesis . Esmolol : RCT demonstrated significant mortality in w/ septic shock treated w/ esmolol Controversy : Single -center trial performed in Italy; control group had a significantly higher mortality rate (80.5%) than that expected for septic patients . No subsequent studies have confirmed these findings . Key points: Esmolol not routinely used for pts in septic shockWhere to draw blood cultures? Drawing cultures from vascular access devices can lead to high rates of false positives. Obtain cultures from vascular access devices only if concerned for CRBSI (rigors with infusion, erythema/induration around line site); otherwise obtain only peripheral blood cultures. 62Pulmonary & Critical Care Vasopressors Usama Abbasi, Ray Parrish CO reflex brady can negate HR from chronotropy Septic (1st ) if HR from Levo CO w/ BP or 3rd pressor needed; AFRVR, HOCM, AS, RV failure Reflex vs NE alone) (VASST, ACLS (1st) Anaphylaxis No benefit in low \"renal\" dosing) Isuprel 1 = 2 agonist HR, SVR Symptomatic Torsades 2-6 mcg bolus 1: Vasoconstriction, duration contraction 2: Sedation/analgesia, vasoconstriction (if peripheral) vs. vasodilation (if central, 15cc NS into area of extravasation 63Pulmonology ( jflood@partners.org ; great resource for questions re: tox screens) Drug/Toxi n Presenting Symptoms Diagnostic Workup Management Acetaminophen See Acetaminophen Toxicity under chapter on Acute Failure Tinnitus, fever, vertigo, N/V/D, respiratory (early), (>30- dL toxi c, though a clinical dx ).

Differential diagnosis: other causes of acute hepatitis (check acute viral hepatitis serologies; ask about APAP, OTCs, herbs, FH of liver disease or autoimmune disease), decompensation of underlying cirrhosis, whether from alcohol (93% w/ alcohol related hepatitis & MDF32 had cirrhosis on biopsy ) or another process. Diagnostics for Alcohol Related Hepatitis Labs: usually cholestatic LFTs (alk phos) with moderately elevated AST & ALT (usually <300), typically in >2:1 ratio. AST & ALT >500 rare except in foamy degeneration; should consider concurrent injury such as acetaminophen, viral, or ischemia . ALT can be normal with concomitant vitamin B6 deficiency. o Other findings : WBC (<20,000; PMNs), Tbili, GGT, INR, or normal ammonia, iron sat, TG o Exclude infection : blood & urine cultures , diagnostic paracentesis if ascites thrombosis, b iopsy : not essential , but helpful to establish diagnosis if any ambiguity , exclude other etiologies, and establish severity Severity & prognosis in acute alcohol related h epatitis ( http://alchepscores.com/livercalculator.html ): o + Tbili.

Relapse is high at 67- 81% at 1 yr. At discharge, patients should receive counseling, medication assisted therapy (acamprosate 666 mg TID, naltrexone 50mg ) and be referred to Bridge Clinic or treatment program for alcohol use disorder Supportive therapy : monitor closely for infection, consider acid suppression with PPI / H2RA , monitor for signs of HRS and avoid nephrotoxic drugs , hold beta blockers if MDF 32 as increased incidence of AKI Nutrition therapy : MVI, thiamine, folate, enteral feeding; nutrition independently decreases mortality; daily protein intake 1.5g/kg and 30-40kcal/kg recommended. Consider nutrition consult while inpatient, as insurance may not cover outpatient consult . If MDF 32 and/or presence of encephalopathy, initiate medical therapy: o Steroids : prednisolone 40mg/d for 4 weeks +/ - taper x 2- 4 weeks; short term survival w/ MDF 32 although ) However, MDF (eg >54) risks may outweigh benefits.

Summary: Consider steroids if MDF >32 (or MELD>20) and there are no contraindications. A dding NAC may be beneficial. Consider pentoxyfylline if steroids are contraindicated. Consult hepatology for consideration of early liver transplant. Long- term, onl y abstinence from alcohol and liver transplant are effective for treating alcohol related hepatitis. 82Gastroenterology End Stage Liver Disease Jacqueline Henson, Amy Yu Definitions Cirrhosis: advanced state of fibrosis and regenerative nodules that distorts pathophysiologic state of impaired liver phos, and GGT may be elevated or normal Diagnostics: viral hepatitis panel, iron studies, ANA, (HBV/HCV), Wilson's, failure, Budd- Chiari syndrome, veno-occlusive mucosal & luminal NH 3, NH 3 & endogenous BDZ-like compounds (NEJM 2016;375:17 ) Immune dysfunction: increased risk of infection; bacterial infection is a major cause of morbidity & mortality Endocrinopathies : hypoglycemia, thyroid dysfunction, hypogonadism, hyperestrinism (palmar erythema, spider angiomata) Coagulopathy : AND anticoagulant factors (protein C/S, ATIII, plasminogen).

Clinical starts peaks 3- 5d, resolves 10d; FENa be normal or high. Usually non- oliguric. Controversy: More recent controlled studies and meta- analyses have raised questions regarding the risk of AKI following contrast, which is probably lower than many previous studies indicated. For now, we operate under the assumption that contrast plays a role. Do not invoke contrast without full workup for other causes (Ann Em Med 2017;69:577 ). Risk factors include higher contrast load, intra- arterial injection, presence diabetes, proteinuria and multiple myeloma. Prophylax is: For high risk pts receiving arterial or IV contrast, give NS at 1ml/kg/hr for 6-12hr pre, 6- 12hr post. No added benefit for Na bicarb, NAC (arterial) (NEJM 2018;378:603), or prophylactic HD (IV) (Am J Med 2012;125:66 ). CARDIORENAL SYNDROME (TYPE 1) : Rev Neph 2013;9:99; CJASN 2013;8:1800 ) Refers to 5 categories of disease processes which impact the heart and kidneys with various causal relationships, but at MGH we use the term to refer to type 1, in which acute CHF leads to AKI. Pathophysiology: Decreased renal perfusion from low CO is one factor, but more importantly, RV failure and high CVP lead to a low trans -renal perfusion pressure. More of a problem with \"underdraining\" (congestion) than with \" underfill ing\" (perfusion), though worsened by neurohumoral activation in setting low EABV . Treatment: Relie f of renal venous congestion. Trend creatinine against TBB to test hypothesis, but expect a lag effect. Loop diuretics are first line for type 1 +/ - addition of thiazide (metolazone / diuril) . ROSE trial (JAMA 2013;310:2533 ): No benefit of low dose dopamine or nesiritide to improve forward flow . CARESS -HF (NEJM 2012;367:2296 ): Ultrafiltration sh owed similar outcomes in regard to weight loss and decompensated CHF symptoms , but worsened renal function compared to pharmacologic therapy with loop/thiazide diuretics. 89Nephrology Acute Kidney Injury Dana Larsen DEFINING AKI + GENERAL MANAGEMENT : (KIDIGO 2012;2:1 ) Prevention: (1) maintain volume status & perfusion pressure, (2) monitor Cr & UOP, (3) avoid hyperglycemia and nephrotoxins, (4) caution w/ contrast. Serum Cr approximates GFR at steady -state only (unable to estimate GFR w/ Cr): must assume GFR< 10 if Cr >1/day Drugs can impair Cr excretion without G FR exposures (contrast, meds, see below), recent infection ( IgA nephropathy in 1- 2 days , PSGN in 10 -14 days ), active infection (sepsis can induce ATN Independent of BP or RBF (JASN 2011;22:999 ); (AIN, vasculitis). 2)Urinalysis (UA) : See urinalysis section for more details, particularly heme, protein, and specific gravity (SG) . 3)Urine chemistries: FENa : (Urine Na * Serum Cr) (Serum Na * Urine Cr). FENa< 1% is suggestive of pre-renal AKI, >2% with ATN. Note this is ONLY verified in oliguric AKI. Healthy controls with low Na intake can have FENa <1% to keep Na balance even. Diagnostic accuracy is improved if repeated ( Clin Nephrol 1980;13:73 <35% consistent with ( Kid Int 2002;62:2223 ) Urine Osm : >500 is consistent with a pre- renal etiology. P atients with ATN are only rarely able to concentrate to this degree. Urine protein: If proteinuria identified on UA , send urine protein and albumin to determine if glomerular vs tubular. Urine albumin/protein ratio < 0.4 strongly suggests tubulointerstitial (Sens 88%, Spin urine on Bigelow 10 across from dialysis unit (call security for access if after hours) . Important if clinical history/above studies are not strongly suggestive or if AKI fails to respond to initial management. Findings will guide next steps.

PD -1 inhibitors are FDA -approved for any microsatellite instability 2018;378:1277 Pre-existing autoimmune disease is NOT an absolute contraindication to the use of ICIs. Can be associated with flare but rarely treatment -limiting (J Clin Oncol ) Definition : systemic autoimmune or inflammatory events due to immune system activation by ICIs Risk factors: o Combination immunotherapy (anti -CTLA -4+anti -PD-1): associated w/ earlier, higher incidence, and severity; significantly less with anti -PD1 compared with anti-CTLA -4 o No predictors of who will develop irAEs. Patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease can flare (see above). Timing : Highly variable based on organ system involved, drug target, monotherapy vs combination.

Continue medications that contribute to comfort, that will prevent uncomfortable events (e.g., maintain rate control to avoid AFRVR), or that have a withdrawal syndrome (e.g., SSRIs). Generally avoid artificial nutrition and hydration - may cause volume overload without meaningful benefit (J Clin Onc 2013 31:111 ) Prio r family +/ - chaplaincy (available 24/7), other care team members (e.g., PCP) . Ask about religious/cultural traditions . Consider early contact of the New England Organ Bank (NEOB) @ 800- 446-6362. The NEOB determines eligibility for donation. They are trained in how to discuss donation with the family ; you DO NOT need to discuss with the family. See also Organ Donation page. When passing off a patient who may pass away, prep the \"Report of Death\" form - at minimum the cause of death section Wit hdrawing ventilatory support (palliative extubation or discontinuation of BiPAP/HFNC) : Prior to extubation (see also MGH MICU Policy and ATS Guidelines for more detail; Am J Resp Crit Care Med 2008 177:912 ): o Allow family time with p atient (if desired) .

Discuss plan/orders w/ RN. o Do not withhold appropriate symptom management because of concern for hastening death (remember the Principle of Double Effect - your focus should be on managing symptoms, including palliative sedation if no other reasonable options ). If in doubt, involve SAR/fellow/attending/pall care. o Discuss with RT (and SAR/ fellow/attending PRN) vent withdrawal plan (immediate withdrawal vs down- titration of vent support) . In some cases, may continue full vent support if death expected rapidly from pressor wean. Medications (see also Non- Pain Symptom Management page): STOP paralytic not already on gtt, give bolus when starting gtt. If increasing gtt, bolus as well - otherwise won't reach new steady state for hours). Work w/ RN to provide anticipatory dosing. o S ymptom Management page DEATH PRONOUNCEMENT PRONOUNCEMENT . Introduce yourself to the family, explain what you are doing, express condolences FEEL for pulse, LISTEN for heart sounds/breath sounds (> 60 sec), SHINE light to determine absence of pupillary light reflex, and NOTE time at the end of your exam, which becomes the time of death AUTOPSIES are free and do not delay funerals (can still have open casket). In addition to helping determine cause of death, they can be instrumental in advancing research. QUESTIONS FOR NEXT OF KIN (Not HCP, but Next of Kin (NOK) : Husband/Wife > Children > Other Family) If no NOK in room, call NOK to notify of patient's death. Ask the family if they would like to see a CHAPLAIN or SOCIAL WORK Ask if family would want an AUTOPSY? If family accepts autopsy, ask obout DISPOSIT ION OF ORGANS . Consider recommending the option of MGH retaining organs for further testing, education, research (if not, value of/info from autopsy lower) Are there OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS they would like you to inform? Will anyone else be COMING TO VIEW THE BODY prior to morgue? What you can tell family: body is kept at MGH until the funeral home calls MGH (path: 617- 726-2967) and arranges for pick -up. Advise family to contact their funeral home, and tell the funeral home that patient passed away at MGH (Social Work can assist ). ONCE YOU LEAVE THE ROOM: Step 1: Notify ATTENDING and PCP . Email acceptable, if death was expected. Step 2: Obtain \"Report of Death\" form from OA. Fill out in BLACK ink. If any mistakes, you will need to START OVER . Step 3: Log into Epic before calling the numbers listed on the form . Step 3: Call the Medical Examiner if necessary or in doubt ( most cases not necessary). Document the first name of the staff member. Step 4: Call New England Organ Bank : 800-446-6362: will need patient's demographics, cause of death. May require: histor y of cancer, recent infections , recent labs, hx dementia, other PMHx . Step 4: Call the Admitting Office (6-3393) to inform them of the death . They will ask cause/time of death, M ed Examiner , NEOB. Step 5: The \"Report of Death\" goes to admitting with the chart . Chart cannot leave the floor until the Report of Death is completed.

Monitor for DI with severe neurologic injury or brain death. o Proper ventilatory support and pulmonary toilet - lung- protective LTVV as in ARDSNet. Prevent pneumonia with head elevation, etc. ( JAMA. 2010;304:2620 ) o Maintenance of glucocorticoids hormone for EF <45% or hemodynamic instability ( limited evidence) o Empiric antibiotics if concern for infection Death pronouncement in the o perating room for DCD pa tients Generally, withdrawal of medical support, including extubation, occurs in the OR after pt is prepped by surgical team All members of the organ recovery teams must be outside of the room from the time of withdrawal of support to declaration of death;otherwise this poses a conflict of interest. Family may be present in the OR if they wish. Medical team (MD and RN) are present to coordinate end of life care from time of withdrawal of support to death, including PR N palliative medications. NEOB staff may not participate in the administration of medications or declaration of death. Death must occur and be declared within 2 hours of extubation, otherwise organs are deemed nonviable. o \"Dead- donor rule\" (DDR) = recovery of organs cannot be the cause of death, and organs should be taken only from persons who are already dead (NEJM 2013;369:1287 ) MD declares death based on the irreversible cessation of circulatory and respiratory function (checks carotid artery for pulsations andauscultates for breath sounds using a sterile ultrasound cover over stethoscope) o PEA arrest meets criteria for cessation of circulatory function so long as there is no pulsatile flow on arterial line. Death can be declared even if cardiac electrical activity persists. o After death is declared, a a 5- minute observation period begins to ensure no ROSC Death paperwork should be signed by declaring MD in the OR (i.e., bring prepped death paperwork with you) 159Rheumatology Approach to Rheumatologic Disease Julie Fiore, Mazin Abdelghany Overview : rheumatologic diseases may be roughly separated int o 4 categories : Arthritis Connective tissue disease Vasculitis Other RA, ACE, IgG4) NB: Always consider malignancy and infection as alternative diagnoses prior to initiation of immunosuppressants unless at risk of permanent organ damage ( i.e., do not withhold glucocorticoids when suspecting TSH, B/C serologies Inflammatory Arthritis Sex arthritis F M of psoriasis, examine nails Reactive arthritis (post -infx) >25 RF- Intermittent RF- RA-like arthritis lasting for wks to mo nths Viral arthritis F > M All ages RF+ (<10%); consider Parvo virus Disease Sex Age Serology Polyarteritis nodosa ; Kawasaki disease (usually in children, can affect large vessels) Small -vessel vasculitis ANCA- ; \u00a7Extractable nuclear antigens (ENAs)Antibody Antigen ANA pattern Disease Comments Inflammatory polyarthritis: RF Fc gamma negative RA HCV Most specific test RA (\"seropositive RA\"), a/w extraarticular only , NOT marker of Connective tissue diseases (SLE, Sjogren's, SSc, MCTD, UCTD, DM/PM): Screen with ANA ANA - ANA = Antinuclear antibodies ( specific ANA Abs listed below).

The introduction of therapeutic hypothermia alters the timeframe for neurological recovery and the interpretation of prognostic markers. Studies of neurological prognostication are hampered by heterogenous patient populations and variable definitions of \"coma\" . We will discuss the clinical predictors of recovery and available diagnostics - clinical exam, electrodiagnostic testing, and neuroimaging . Cerebral perf ormance category (CPC) Good Outcome: oCPC 1. Mild deficits. Able to work. May have have mild neurologic/psychologic deficits. oCPC 2. Moderate deficits. Capable of independent activities of daily life. Able to work in sheltered environment. Poor Outcome: oCPC 3. Severe deficits. Conscious but dependent on others. Ranges from ambulatory to severe dementia /paralysis. oCPC 4. Coma (no wakefulness) or vegetative state unawareness). oCPC 5. etc. Therapeut ic hypothermia: Post-cardiac arrest patients are cooled within 6 hours of return of spon taneous circulation (ROSC) , to 32-34\u00b0C, where they are maintained for 24 hours via surface or endovascul ar cooling methods ( Nat Rev Neurol 2014;10:190 ). equivalent efficacy ( NEJM 2013;369:2197 ). During this period, patients can be paralyz ed with neuromuscular blocking agents to prevent shivering, and are commonly maintained on propofol, midazolam, fentanyl and other sedative s. After completion of 24 hours of TH, patients are typically rewarmed in a controlled fashion over 8 -12 hours, with discontinuation of paralytics (if used) only once the shivering threshold \u2014estimated at around 36\u00b0C\u2014 is passed; sedative-hypnotics are continued while patients are paralyzed. Time frame post cardiac arrest diagnostics : Day 1-2 Therapeutic hypothermia and rewarming oElectroencephalography (EEG) Timing: started during TH and continued for 24 hours post normothermia. Poor prognosis: absence of EEG activity, seizures, burst suppression (Neurology 2013;80:339 ). Positive prognosis: continuous background pattern and reactivity at day 3 or later. oClinical exam Poor prognosis: Status myoclonus at <48 hours post cardiac arrest or normothermia. Defined as spontaneous, repetitive, unrelenting, generalized multifocal myoclonus involving the face, limbs and axial musculature. no EEG correlate. Absent pupillary, corneal, and oculocephalic reflexes. Absent brainstem reflexes, along with apnea and other criteria (depending on local guidelines), may signify brain death. Day 3-5oSomatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) - measurement of brain activity in reponse to somatosensory stimulation Timing: 48 hours post cardiac arrest or normothermia. Poor prognosis: Bilateral absence of N20, which reflects the integrity of thalamocortical projections. oNeuron specific enolase (serum) - non-specific marker of neuronal injury (misnomer as it is found in RBC and platelets). Timing: 24 -72 hours post cardiac arrest or nomothermia. Poor prognosis: >33 ug/l and increasing daily NSE levels (Neurology 2011;77:623 ). NSE is prognostic in the pre - therapeutic hypothermia era but is not well validated in patients who received therapeutic hypothermia. Not part of MGH neuroprognostication guidelines. oCT head, 48 hours post cardiac arrest or normothermia Poor prognosis: wide spread hypodensity, loss or reversal of grey-white differentiation. oBrain MRI, 72 hours post cardiac arrest or normothermia Poor prognosis: DWI and ADC changes suggestive of ischemic (Ann Neurol 2009;65:394 ). Quantitative ADC values may correlate with severity. MRI can be insensitive to lesions if not performed during normothermia. Combining prognost ic indicators (MGH neuroprognostication guidelines, 2017) : Prognostic value of at least 2 of the following findings (measured after completion of re-warming following TH, between 36 -72 hours post cardiac arrest) - bilaterally a bsent SSEP, unreactive EEG Background, e arly b rainstem reflexes.

Consult psychiatry for pts requiring IMs. oIM haloperidol (5mg) should be co- administered with either IM diphenhydramine (25 -50mg) or IM benztropine (0.5 - 1mg) to reduce risk of dystonia although these medications may temporarily worsen delirium . oIM olanzapine or thorazine may be given alone but should be used cautiously in elderly pts given risk of orthostasi s oIM olanzapine cannot be administered with IM benzos/barbiturates due to risk of cardiorespiratory depressionAPPEARANCE/BEHAVIOR : grooming/hygiene, eye contact, attitude /cooperation , abnormal mvmt (fidgeting, tics, TD) SPEECH/LANGUAGE : mechanics (rate, volume, prosody, articulation, fluent or not if pt can place 5 words together = fluent) ; paucity of speech, mutism , echolalia (copying provider's speech), verbigeration (repeating meaningless phrases) THOUGHT PROCESS : presence of disorganization (including derailing/tangentiality ); also note vague use of references (common in psychosis); thought blocking (pt appears unable to produce responses to questions) MOOD/AFFECT : pt's own description, observed affect, future , grandiosity) THOUGHT ideas, obsessions , poverty of content COGNITION : level of consciousnes s, orientation, MOCA INSIGHT/JUDGMENT : give examples (insight: patient sx as pathological/ accepts dx; judgment: pt takes 193Psychiatry Consent, Capacity, & Legal Laura DiCola Three Elements of Valid Informed Consent Psychosomatics 1997;38:119; NEJM 2007; 357:1834 1. Relevant Clinical Information: A t minimum: diagnosis, proposed intervention, its purpose, its risks/benefits, alternatives, and risks/benefits of alternatives (including n o intervention) 2. Voluntary D ecision : The decision must be voluntary and without coercion from hospital staff or family/friends 3. Capacity: Confirm patient has the ability to make a decision about the specific question being addressed (see below) Exceptions to I nformed Consent 1. Emergency: Imminent risk of death or serious harm without medical intervention. A ll attempts should be made to find HCP /other surrogate decision -maker. Always discuss with At tending of Record. Document emergent situation, lack of capacity, lack of available surrogate, need for emergent intervention. Consider 2nd opinion/consulting MGH lawyer -on-call. 2. Lack of Capacity or Competency: Turn to the appropriate HCP, guardian or other surrogate decision-maker (see below) Capacity Assessment Capacity: person's ability to make an informed decision about a specific question . It can change over time. Competence : legal designation made by judge. Determines a person's ability to make decisions in multiple areas of life. Any physician can make a determination of capacity. Psychiatry should be consulted only for capacity assessment in complex cases, such as when neuropsychiatric illness m ay be impairing decision-making or when the pt, family, and medical team disagree on decision- making. Before consulting psychiatry, explain risks/benefits to patient and know patient's expressed decision. If consult required, have risks & benefits of each intervention available to consultant. The strictness of the capacity test varies as the risk/benefit ratio of a decision changes: the more favorable the risk/benefit ratio, the lower the standard for capacity to consent and higher the standard to refuse, and vice versa. Crit eria for Determining Capacity ( all must be met for patient to have capacity) NEJM 2007; 357:1834 NEJM 1988; 319:1635 Criterion Approach in Physician's Assessment Communicate a clear and stable choice Ask patient to indicate a choice. No expression is a presumption of incapacity . Frequent reversals of choice may indicate lack of capacity. Understand relevant information Ask patient to describe his/her understanding of the information given by the physician (diagnosis, proposed intervention, purpose of intervention, risks/benefits, risks/benefits of alternatives including no intervention) . Appreciate the situation and its consequences Ask patient to describe views of diagno sis, interventions, and likely outcomes. Is patient aware of her illness? Its seriousness? Consequences? Be able to manipulate information provided in a rational fashion Ask patient to compare treatment o ptions, consequences, and reasons for choice. Does the patient weigh the risks and benefits logically? Docu menting Capacity Assessment: \"B ased upon my evaluation of the pt, he/she does/does not express a consistent preference regarding the proposed treatment, does/does not have a factual understanding of the current situation as evidenced by [example ], does/does not appreciate the risks and benefits of treatment and non-treatment, and is able/unable to rationally manipulate information to make a decision as evidenced by [example ]. Therefore, in my opinion, this pt has/lacks capacity to make this medical decision.\" If capacity present : \"We should respect the patient's right to make this decision to [details ].\" If lacks capacity: \" Surrogate decision -maker needed.\" Sur rogate Decision-Makers Encourage each pt to sign legal HCP form specifying surrogate. Surrogate should be activated when pt lacks capacity. Surrogate's job is to make the decision pt would have made for herself if she were able\u2014 not what the surrogate wants HCP may be uncomfirmed (most common) or confirmed. C ourt- confirmed HCP is required when pt's surrogate is activated & pt actively objects to surrogate's decision. If HCP confirmation required, contact Guardianship team. Guardianship : Legal process by which the MA Probate Court grants a guardian the authority to make decisions on behalf of someone whom a judge has ruled is not competent. Guardianship required when there is no HCP identified & pt is unable to designate a HCP . Note: a patient may not have capacity to make a certain medical decision and still be able to designate a HCP. For help: contact 'Guardianship team' of Lisa Lovett, LICSW, & Mary Lussier-Cushing, RN/PC o Rogers guardianship : Granted by court, allows guardian to authorize the use of specifically approved antipsychotics For emergent or life-threatening situations in which a patient lacks decisional capacity , emergency guardianship is not required to provide lifesaving treatment & should not delay care.

Before prescribing, review potential benefits vs. risks. MA law: Must check PMP and limit 7 days for initial opioid prescription. Plan to d/c in 6- 8 weeks if no benefit LON G-TERM OPIOIDS FOR MSK PAIN : Screening, Prescribing and Monitoring (e.g. Pain Agreement, Tox Screens) Vanishingly limited evidence for chronic MSK pain. High risks of hyperalgesia, tolerance, dependence, addiction. Before prescribing longer- term non- hypnotics . Screen for sleep apnea, SUD, mental health. Stress that pain control is a mutual goal, complete pain relief is unlikely. Perform a risk assessment ( Screener & Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain (SOAPP )-Revised ). Check MassPAT (also in Epic under PHS applications). Obtain prior records & speak to prior prescribers. Agree that single prescriber will provide scripts. Create a pain agreement with the patient : Discuss 6-8 week initial trial, safe use, secure storage and disposal of opioids. Educate that random UTox and oral drug swabs, random pill counts are for pt safety. Rx on 28- day cycle ending on weekday to facilitate refills. Prescribe the patient naloxone to be used in case of overdose risks. Discontinue opioids if no significant benefit at 6 -8 wks, significant side effects, risk > benefit, non- adherence. Caution prescribing > 50 mg/day morphine equivalents (MME), avoid > 90 MME (obtain pain consult). Follow -up for longer -term opioids: See patients in office at least q1- 3 months to review pain, function, side effects, compliance, and re- evaluate plan. Early refill requests should trigger an appointment to assess reason, obtain tox screen, discuss proper use. 205Primary Care LGBTQ Health Sarah Axelrath, Seth Tobolsky Preventive (Am Fam Physician 2015;91:844 ) Background: o the following areas: HIV/AIDS, STIs, cancer screening, immunizations, substance & tobacco use, mental health, domestic violence (IOM 2011 ) o 2006- 2009: 34% increase in HIV incidence among MSM ages 13- 29 (48% among African American MSM).

You should also know name of the outpatient provider before calling an inpatient consult. o Know your patien t - you may be asked to provide additional information (current status, exam , workup). Briefly review the admit note and briefly see/examine the patient if you have not done so previously. GI: melena/hematochezia, outpt cardiologist Renal: stage/ tx history, biopsy results (for new dx), current anticoagulants, special slide, outpt oncologist ID: current/past micro data, possible sources, current/prior abx (incl # of days), fever curve, hardware, travel, exposures o Know your quest ion - Bigelow JAR should specify consult question in task list. If not there, ASK. It is always OK to clarify. To do DURING the page/ call: o Call as early in the day as possible (ideally before noon). The paging directory: ppd. partners .org or \"Phone Directory\" in Epic o In your page to consulting team, include: pt name, MRN, location, call back #, brief consult question +/ - level of urgency o Avoid \"curbside\" questions. If there is a specific question about management, call a formal consult . o Tell the consultant a brief HPI, a clear explanation of the team's thinking and a clear and specific question To do AFTER the call: o Invite the consultant to find you to relay their recommendations or tell them who will be covering for you CALL ING EMERGENT CONSULTS Surgery: STAT to surgeon means life-t hreatening emergency (eg: hemorrhage, lost airway, perforated or ischemic bowel) include reason for consult in your page to help surgeon triage urgency o Page \"Senior Resident o n call\" under Emergency Surgery/Trauma (Churchill) Team (Red/Blue/White/Green) Psychiatry (e g: pt actively trying to leave AMA w/ unclear capacity; security conc erns, major behavioral issues) pm: p33061 (Emergency Consult Resident).

Ideal for vascular, skin, breast, thyroid. -Low frequency (2-5MHz): resolution, deeper tissue penetration. Ideal for abdominal, OB/GYN, cardiac. Gain : Signal amplification. Similar to brightness control. Depth: Depth of field of view (FOV). Excessively large FOV spatial resolution; tight FOV limits view of nearby structures. Attenuation : Reduced signal tr ansduction through a medium = signal intensity behind it (bone /air have high attenuation) Transducer ( probe): Converts electricity into sound waves transmits sounds wave into tissue receives sound waves echoed back from tissue . Indicator (denoted by light or notch on probe) displays on left of the screen. Exception: echocardiography indicator displays on right side. SECTOR (cardiac) probe: Good for looking in small sonographic windows (i.e., between intercostal spaces for cardiac or pulm imaging); low resolution, produces fan -like image. LINEAR (vascular) probe : Good for shallow structures (i.e. vascular, soft tissue). Uses high frequency with good resolution, produces rectangular image. CURVED (abdominal) probe: Good for deeper structures (i.e. intra-abdominal ). Uses lower frequency; combines linear and sector probe image qualities. Commonly Used Modes : B-mode (brightness mode): Standard 2D gray- scale image. D-mode (doppler): Detects flow to or away from transducer. Useful to find and define vessels, flow across valves oColor direction and velocity are color coded and superimposed on B -mode image. \"BART\" (B lue is A way from probe, R ed is T owards) oPower detects very low flow but not direction, useful in vascular compromise oSpectral velocity presented graphically on a timeline M-mode (motion mode): Takes a slice of a B -mode image over time. Often used in TTE. Useful to assess lung sliding for pneumothorax. General Imaging Concepts : Typical appearance of normal tissue: Skin and pleura are smooth and brighter than surrounding tissue ( echogenic or hyperechoic) Fat and muscle are dark, though varies depending on the tissue ( hypoechoic) Fluid (e.g. blood, effusion) appears black on ultrasound ( anechoic), though thick fluids (pus) can be brighter than typical fluid Tendons and nerves are bright / hyperechoic when perpendicular to probe, but dark / hypoechoic when angle is changed (anisotropy). Bone has a bright hyperechoic rim (due to reflection) around a black / anechoic image with a shadow beyond it Artif acts: Elements seen on ultrasound image that do not exist in reality Reflection : Proportional to the difference in acoustic impedence between two tissues ( difference = r eflection) Relative acoustic impedance: bone >> solid organ > fat >> lung >> air . Shadowing : signal beyond a strongly attenuating OR reflecting structure (e.g. stones, bone) Enhancement: signal posterior to weakly attenuating (hypo or anechoic) structure (e.g., cysts) Mirror image: Structures in front of strong reflector (e.g. diaphragm) appear to lie behind it as well Reverberation: Evenly spaced lines at various depths beyond a strong reflector (e.g. A lines beyond pleura) Comet tail : Tiny, narrow reverberations beyond very strong reflector (e.g. metal pellet) blending into a line B mode M mode Rib Rib Pleura Lung Fascia Muscle Indicator Enhancement Shadowing 228Procedures Ultrasound Basics Sean Mendez Imaging and Tips : Diagnostic Use : Pneumothorax: Use SECTOR probe. With patient supine, look in the 3rd intercostal space on the anterior chest. Identify the hyperechoic rims of the ribs with posterior shadowing ; within the intercostal space identify the hyperechoic stripe that is the pleura. A normal lung will slide along the pleural line with respiration, a pneumothorax will not. Ifambiguous, use M mode to confirm. A lack of lung sliding will change the norma l 'seashore' sign to a static 'barcode' sign (see pictures) . Sens 91%, Spec 98%, superior to CXR. A lung point is not sensitive but is 100% specific. (J Emerg Trauma Shock 2012;5(1):76 , Ann Emerg Med 2013 61(2):207 ). Pulmonary embolism: SECTOR probe. Bedside ultrasound can be used to identify right heart strain. Look for RV size LV size, septal bowing, though note sens/spec for PE 53%/83%. RV/LV ratio is most easily visualized in the apical 4 chamber view, but can be misleading based upon slight chan ges in plane. Assess with septum vertical in line with midpoint of probe. Combine with the parasternal axes for better reliability . (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2017;30:714 ) Pulmonary Edema: Use SECTOR probe to evaluate the lung between rib spaces as above, across lung fields as for auscultation. Look for B -lines: comet like artifacts that shine perpendicular from the pleural line and obliterate A -lines. 3 in one interspace is consistent with interstitial fluid , and bilaterally suggests pulmonary edema. Operator dependent but can outperform CXR . (Am J Emerg Med 2015;33(5):620 ) Pericardial Effusion: Use SECTOR probe. Look for an anechoic stripe between the heart and the hyperechoic pericardium, though hemorrhagic or purulent effusions can appear more complex. On parasternal long axis this will be anterior to the descending aorta, while a pleural effusion would be pos terior. All four views are important, but often only subxiphoid used in emergencies. Look for chamber collapse indicating tamponade : RA is more sensitive; RV is more specific . (Resuscitation 2011;82(6):671 ) Volume Status: Use the SECTOR probe. IVC collapsibility has been proposed as a proxy for CVP and fluid responsiveness, though data is mixed and there are no consensus guidelines. Start with subcostal view of RA/RV, then rotate probe to the sagittal plane to find the IVC draining into RA and abutting the liver. Look at IVC 2Cmfrom RA: Fluid responsiveness or an underfilled IVC is by 1) IVC diameter2.1cm and 2) IVC collapses \u00bd its diameter . Can use M mode to track variation, cycles are inverted if spontaneously breathing vs mechanical ventilation, more accurate in thelatter. (Crit Care 2012 47(5):550 ) Pr ocedural: Refer to white book pages on specific procedures for more details Paracentesis: Use CURVED probe . Locate largest fluid collection, often in LLQ. Try rolling patient to side to increase pocket s ize. LINEAR probe can help identify any overlying vessels to your approach, particularly the inferior epigastrics. Hyperechoicfinger -like projections are bowel within the anechoic ascites. Measure the depth of the abd wall and compare to your needle to determine when to expect flash, though with tentingthis will be a slight underestimation . Central venous access: Use LINEAR probe. Reduces complications and quality of placement compared to landmark approach (Crit Care 2017;21:225 ). oIn-plane (long axis): Can view entire tip, but harder to keep needle in view oOut-of-plane (short axis): Easier to center needle, may underestimate depth Peripheral IV: Use LINEAR probe. Most of your time should be in finding the best vein to go for, often in the medial groove between biceps/triceps. Track along vessel length todetermine trajectory, look for large, superficial, compressible vessels that are not adjacent to pulsatile, non -compressible arterial vessels. As above, in plane vs out of plane . B lines Waves Sand Effusion RA Collapse Liver RA IVC Barcode Sign Seashore Sign Pulmonary Edema: Abd wall Peripheral IV Sean Mendez Indication: Non -emergent access i n a patient for whom 2+ attempts at blind PIV placement have failed or have a history of difficult access. If emergent, obtain IO or central access . Equipment: IV catheter: Use a \"straight\" IV, not a \"butterfly\" ; 20G or larger (smaller IVs not well visualized on US ); Standard length (30mm) ok if superficial edge of the vein < 0.8 cm deep; Long IVs (48mm+ ) best if depth 0.8 cm. ( Long 20G IVs only available in ED ); IV starter pack (includes tourniquet, chlorhexidine, Tegaderm, gauze and tape), sterile lubricant (what you use for a rectal exam is fine), Tegaderm to cover the ultrasound probe, and extension tubing, which should be primed and attached to a saline flush . Ultrasound machine with a vascular probe . Optional : additional tourniquet (stacked, not serial) , tubes for labs and vacutainer adapter (if you need labs) . Pr eparation: Place a tourniquet high, near axilla . Using a transverse view (short axis) and shallow depth (about 2 cm), scan forear m. Anatomy is variable. Upper arm is more predictable, see diagram. Success is predicted primarily by the diameter of the vein (>0.5 cm is preferred) and the superficial edge of the vein should be < 1.6 cm deep . A vein should be fully compressable and pulseless. Scan its course to learn trajectory. Use minimal pressure to avoid collapsing vein and accurately assess depth. It is important to estimate depth correctly because if IV is too short, it will come out. Keep little finger on skin to stabilize probe. C lean the site and probe with alcohol or chlorhexidine. Cover the probe with a sterile Tegaderm. Apply sterile lubricant. Transverse Technique (Short Axis) - Pros : requires less finesse with the ultrasound probe and allows visualization of adjacent structures. Faster. Cons : harder to visualize the needle tip. Select the point where you intend for the catheter to enter the vein . Prepare to puncture the skin distal to this point (distance = depth of vein) . Hold the needle at 45 to the skin . Puncture the skin just enough to identify the tip of the needle on the screen. Advance the probe until you lose the needle tip. Then advance the needle until it reappears. When you are right above the vein it will likely compress under the pressure of the needle. Make a quick, but very small jab to enter the vein without puncturing the back wall. You should see a bright spot the in the center of the dark vessel . Drop the angle of the nee dle. Advance the probe until the needle tip is no longer visible. Then advance the needle again so that is reappears in the center of the vessel. After you have advanced the needle tip 3- 5mm within the vein you can either advance the catheter until hubbed or proceed advancing the needle by the same method until hubbed. Then retract the needle, attach extension tubing, remove tourniquet, and ensure blood return/flush before securing catheter. Longitudinal Technique (Long axis) - Pros : improved visualizati on of the needle tip helps to avoid going through the back wall of the vein and you can advance the catheter under direct visualization. Cons : challenging to maintain probe, vein and needle in plane; cannot see adjacent structures . Identify your target vein in the transverse view , then slowly rotate the probe to obtain a longitudinal view with the indicator towards your needle . Align your needle in the plane of the probe, puncture the skin at a 45 and visualize the needle tip. Advance the needle until it begins to compress the vein. V ery small jab to enter the vein. Advance the needle until the you can see that the tip of the catheter itself is fully within the vein. Do not to go through the back wall. At this point you can advance the catheter under direct visualization. Troubl eshooting - Cannot see needle: bounce the needle tip to generate artifact. Too much loose tissue: a sk someone to assist by putting tension on the tissue without applying pressure over your target vein. Vein rolls: reposition to make sure you are directly over the middle of the vein and use a slightly steeper angle to take advantage of the sharp edge of the needle. Trouble finding any veins , try using a blood pressure cuff high in the axilla instead of a tourniquet, but give the patient frequent breaks Re sources - NEJM Video : long, but comprehensive.

Contraindications: Vein thrombosis or stenosis should prompt another site. oagulopathy/ thrombocytopenia are relative contraindications , if severe coagulopathy, avoid subclavian (not a compressible site + difficult to effectively monitor for bleed) . Site selection: General preference at MGH is R IJ > LIJ > subclavian > femoral due to historical concern for infection. However, more recent data suggests no difference between these sites with proper attention to sterile technique. Catheter selection: Select based on number of lumens and speed of infusion; if rapid infusion required large bore, short length Cordis Alternatives: PICC (if no concern for bacteremia) or IO (should not be used for > 24h, but in extreme circumstances OK for 48h). Scheduled exchange of catheters without evidence of infection is NOT indicated Cultures drawn from indwelling catheter have false (+) rate; generally not done aside from time of sterile placement (NEJM 2003;348:1123 ) Internal Jugular Vein Video https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMvcm0810156 Advantages Disadvantages Compressible vein Carotid artery puncture 2 -10% Lower risk of pneumothorax (< 1%) than subclavian Less patient comfort Ability to use real -time ultrasound Anatomy not as consistent as subclavian All IJ CVCs placed with real -time US guidance @ MGH: first attempt failure, procedure time, and failure / complication rate.

If using Doppler, mark out course of artery with marking pen or indentations from top of Bic pen. If using US , once needle is withdrawn and plastic catheter visualized in the artery, it can be advanced under US guidance without use of the guide wire. This can be helpful if artery is small. If unable to thread guide wire AFTER ATTEMPTING TO SPIN duringinsertion, consider micropuncture wire (cardiac cath lab or MICU med room) . May help with atherosclerotic arteries at the price of risk of perforation After multiple attempts, the artery may spasm. Pursue al ternative site. Femoral artery access can be considered in difficult cases. Use the long catheter in the Arrow a line kit. Puncture must occur distal to the inguinal ligament to prevent RP bleed. Too distal, however, and the femoral artery will bifurcate into superficial and deep femoral ves sels. The femoral artery usually transverses the from pubic symphysis to the ASIS. Optimal point of skin puncture is 1- 2 cm below the inguinal ligament at point where pulse is palpated ( see above) Proper f emoral puncture site ( Interventional Cardiac Catheterization Handbook , 3rd Ed. 2013) Daily for ischemia (cool, white, purple) & infection ( need for removal) 233Procedures Intraosseous Line Placement Chris Kearney General Considerations : Video: If you have 15 min If you have 1 min Anatomy : Veins that drain medullary sinuses of bones.

Magnetic pole holds the needle in place on the drill; t urn the safety cap clockwise for removal 8. Hold drill perpendicular to bone; manually press the needle through the skin until it touches the bone 9. Confirm you see one black line on the needle (5mm mark ); if not, use a longer needle 10. Apply gentle, steady, downward pressure while holding the trigger ; allow drill to do the work 11. Release trigger when decrease resistance felt (\"give\" or \"pop \") as you enter into medullary space 12. While holding catheter in place, pull straight up from the catheter to remove driver 13. Unscrew the needle stylet by rotating counterclockwise (both stylet and needle are encased in colored plastic) 14. Aspirate marrow to confirm placement. Prior to attaching tubing, send labs - blood samples may only be obtained in patients with spontaneous cardiac activity or during initial CPR before drug and fluid infusion through the IO. 15. Attach connector tubing and flush IO w/ NS or 1% lidocaine over 45s if the p atient is awake (IO infusions are VERY painful ); if the patient is unconscious, rapid 10mL NS . Look for superficial swelling, and note that n o flush means no flow! 16. Apply IO dressing stabilizer - FYI each size needle has a different dressing, will not fit if dressing for other size 17.

Use L4- F etal position ( maximize head and hip flexion), no hip / shoulder rotation; keep back parallel to edge of bed Upright (easier in obese): Sit on bed, head / arms rest on table, spine flexed To identify target, place a hand firmly on each iliac crest and mark where your thumbs meet at the midline, or draw a line between the iliac crests. B efore inserting the needle, place your thumb and pointer finger on either side of the spine to ensure the needle is midline Sitting while performing the procedure i s often easier than standing, as the needle is in your line of sight Protocol: (JAMA 2006;296:2012 ) 1) Prep : Sterilize target . Mak e lidocaine wheal w/ 25 G, then inject track (aspiration before injecting, goal is not spinal anesthesia). Keep CSF collection tubes in order nearby . If checking pressure, have manometer connected and ready. 2) Tap: Check needle / stylet mobility. Bevel should face ceiling when pt is lateral. Needle angles toward the umbilicus, straight at the back. Stabilize with your hand against the skin and advance with your dominant hand. Remove stylet f requently to check for CSF flow but always keep stylet in place when advancing . 3) Troubleshoot : If hitting bone, partially withdraw , adjust angle, and re- advance. Try another space below if no luck. If patient has pain, DO NOT withdraw ASK \"where?\" If pain is shooting down the left side, withdraw slight ly and go slightly more to the right . 4) Measure OP : Once flow is established, remove stylet and connect manometer to measure opening pressure (must be in lateral decubitus position). Pt m ust extend legs to obtain accurate pressure. If performing therapeutic LP, drain until pressure normal . 5) Collect : Collect CSF tubes 1 to 4. If flow slows, try rotating needle or minimally advancing or withdraw ing with stylet in place. 6) Finish : re-insert stylet prior to needle removal (associated w/ post-LP headache).

A pericardial pigtail catheter is often left in for24-72h to allow for serial drainage, preventing re -accumulation and repeated procedures. Frequency of drainage depends on chronicity and size of the effusion, usually q6 -q12h. Recommendations are often found in the report from the cath lab when the drain was initially placed. Give cefazo lin 1g q8h (or vancomycin if PCN allergy) for prophylaxis while drain is in place. Monitor effusion resolution and recurrent tamponade. Check serial hemodynamics/pulsus paradoxus. If >100cc output/day for 3 days s/p drain placement, aggressive therapy ma y be indicated (i.e., sclerosing a gents, pericardial window, etc.) Consider removal of pericardial drain if <50cc output over 24 hours. Obtain approval from cardiology prior. Ma terials : Sterile technique: gloves, mask, hat Sterile towels Chl orhexidine swabs (at least 3) 60cc screw -on syringe (x2 -3 if high output) New blue cap for 3- way stopcock Heparin pre- mixed syringe (10U/mL) Tec hnique : 1. Set up sterile field. Put on, gloves, mask and hat, gown is optional 2. Ask nursing to lift catheter off skin by flu sh port. Sterilize distal exposed catheter and stopcock with chlorhex swab. Holding the sterilized area, take catheter from nursing and sterilize remaining portion 3. Place sterile towels around and underneath distal catheter and stopcock, and lay catheter down 4. Ensure the stopcock is turned towards the catheter. This closes the catheter line. 5. Remove and throw away one blue cap (doesn't matter which). 6. Sterilize open stopcock tip with iodine or chlorhex swab. 7. Hold up flush port; nursing will connect heparin sy ringe (syringe itself is not sterile) to open/sterilized tip, turn stopcock to the remaining capped valve, and infuse 2cc heparin. 8. Turn stopcock back towards catheter, remove (do not discard) heparin syringe, and connect 60cc syringe. 9. Turn stopcock to the remaining capped valve and slowly withdraw pericardial fluid. This may require significant negative pressure. Consider different patient positions ( Trendelenberg, lateral decubitus, etc .) to mobilize pericardial effusion. experience chest disco mfort. Monitor hemodynamics 10. Save/transfer pericardial fluid if needed for analysis. Otherwise discard. 11. Can stop draining once fluid flow diminishes/ceases. Turn stopcock back towards catheter and remove syringe. 12. Ask nursing to re-attach heparin syringe and infuse another 2cc heparin, again closing stopcock to the patient 13. Remove heparin syringe and attach new blue cap to open valve.14. Consider re- sterilizing distal exposed catheter and stopcock with chlorhex swab. 15. Write procedure note. Be sure to deduct the 2- 4cc infused heparin when calculating amount of fluid removed.

As you go through the Discharge Summary tab, click on the \"Refresh\" button to move completed items from the \"Not Completed\" to \"Completed\" column. All components must be completed prior to a discharge to a facility. Only the \"D/C Order Rec\" needs to be completed for a patient to be discharged home. D/C Order Rec : oReview Prior to Admission Medications : Update home medication list. If they were not accurately verified at the time of admission, the discharge medication list will be inaccurate and may be confusing to a patient with regards to which medications to modify, continue, or discontinue. oDischarge Problem List: Add all relevant hospital problems and diagnoses - this is important for a patient's transition to outpatient providers. You can change the \"Principal\" diagnosis for billing purposes. \"Resolved\"problems will not remain on a patient's problem list after they are discharged. oReconcile Meds for Discharge : Choose whether to modify, resume, or stop taking each pre -admission medication. You can also prescribe new medications that are being given inpatient. Select patient's preferred pharmacy for e- prescriptions . oPlace New Orders : Select appropriate discharge disposition. Under \"Order Sets and Pathways\", select \" General Adult Discharge Order Set \" and complete. Do NOT complete \"Referral to Home Health VNA\" or the \" face to face\" - this will be done by case management. AVS Pt Instructions : oReason for admission : Briefly state the patient's medical diagnosis/reason for admission in 1- 3 words using patient -friendly language (eg : pneumonia , low sodium level, urinary tract infection, fainting, etc. ). oImportant events, results, medication changes, and instructions : This is meant FOR THE PATIENT to clarify the reason for his/her hospitalization, highlight important testing/interventions, and briefly explain discharge instructions/follow -up plans. Important to consider health literacy, native language, and language fluency for each individual patient. Additional Patient Instructions : You can leave this section blank. Sometimes residents add wound care or post -procedure instructions here; specialists may leave specific instructions here as well. Scheduled Partners Appts : This will automatically populate with upcoming scheduled Partners appointments. Follow -Up: All relevant non- Partners appointments should be manually entered here. You can also enter appointments that have yet to be made with a phone number for the patient to call. Brief Summary : Update the one -liner one last time. It is helpful to make this a brief but comprehensive summary of the entire hospitalization to preface the details in the hospital course. Hospital Course: Use the admission H&P and most recent progress note to identify which problems should be included in the Hospital Course. Lump rather than split your hash- tagged problems into paragraph form. For each problem, include:1) relevant presenting symptoms and exam findings , 2) labs, imaging, and studies used to diagnose the problem , 3) consultant recommendations , 4) treatment course and discharge plan, 5) post-hospital follow -up items (including repeat labs and f/u incidentalomas). Less is more - focus on the big- picture overview and the clinical reasoning that guided your decision -making and management of each problem. Try to avoid MGH -specific abbreviations (eg: RUQUS, LENIs). Some find it helpful to copy and paste the admission H&P below the hospital course, especially if the patient is followed by a provider outside of Partners. Discharge Exam : Copy and paste exam from last progress note, but make sure this is up to date. Provider Follow Ups : Identify key lab, imaging, and other items that a provider needs to follow up after discharge. Please note that any pending pathology and send out tests should be included here as they do not automatically pull into thepending results section. Be sure to review all imaging results and consultant recommendations for follow -up. Some residents comment on medication titration suggestions and key medication changes. Finalize DC Summary : Once the discharge orders are signed, a new button appears under this section that allows you to create the actual discharge summary that will be filed in the Epic. Click the button and then click into the note writing space that opens on the right. Press F2 and select the general medicine discharge summary template from the drop-down menu. This will create a discharge summary containing the contents of the other free text fields already completed. You can edit this once signed as long as your attending has not already signed the addendum. 250Logistics for consult pagers Emergency Numbers Senior On (Med Sr)/Bauer Room 3-1388, p22337 ED Triage Sr (ED Sr) 617-224-2599 Consult Pager (Code Backup) p13480 Radiology (stat CXR) 6-3050 Pharmacy (on RT (on call) p24225 Acute stroke (neurology) p34282 ICU Nursing Supervisor 6-6718, p25213 Hospital Floors Phone Fax ED - Front desk 4-4100 6-7415 Acute 4-4170 Urgent 4-4190 Fast 6-3496 6-3800 Bigelow/Gray Bigelow Bigelow - Endoscopy Suite 6-8074 4-6832 Blake 6 - Transplant Surgery 4-8610 4-8650 Blake 7 - MICU 6-8048 4-0102 Blake 8 SICU 4-4410 4-4450 Blake 11 - Psychiatry 4-9110 4-9150 Blake 12 - ICU 6-8071 6-7560 Blake 14 - Labor & 4 - 11 - Cardiac 4-6010 4-6050 Phillips 21 - Gynecology 4-6110 4-6150 Phillips 22 - Surgery / HMG 4-6210 6-4228 6-6106 6-7555 White Surgery 6-3336 6-7550 White 8 - Medicine 6-3339 6-7551 White 9 - Medicine 6-3342 6-7557 White 10 - Medicine 6-3345 6-7564 White 11 6 -3789) 4-3100 Outpatient pharmacy (private line) 6-2354 Pharmacy - White 8, 9 p17648 Pharmacy - White 10, 11 p 17718 Pharmacy - Bigelow 11 p27604 Pharmacy - Bigelow 9 p20174 Pharmacy - Blake 7 p 27614 Pharmacy - Ellison 9 p 17647 Pharmacy - Ellison 10 p 27629 Pharmacy - Ellison 14 p17905 Pharmacy - Ellison 16 p30363 Pharmacy - Phillips 20 p27613 Laboratories lab - Bigelow 5 6-3856 Blood bank - Bigelow 2 6-3623 Microbiology - Bigelow 5 6-3613 After hours (blood culture room) 6-7919 Parasitology 6-3861 Virology 6-3820 Pathology lab (Flow, ANCA, EM) 6-8487 (blood/urine) -7615 CCU Fellow Back -Up - see Partners Paging Directory Daytime Issues (non -HF ward patient) 2nd yr CCU fellow Overnight Issues (crashing patient) 1st yr Ward fellow STAT Echo Echo fellow Access (hematoma, sheath, IABP) Access fellow Cardiology Studies Cath Lab Lab 6-7737 Pacer Interrogation Studies - Warren 9 (PVR/ABI) 6-2034 Pulmonary Studies PFTs - Cox 2 6-1200 Sleep Study (inpatient/outpatient) 4-7426 GI Studies Endoscopy Lab - Blake 4 6-8074 Neurology Studies EEG - Blake 12 6-3640 (Translation Service) IPOP Access Code #017616 Record requests (pull charts) Transcriptions (stat dictations) 4 -8409) 6-3390/6 -3384 Finance Department 6-2171 MD connect (OSH Transfer Requests) 6-3384 Physician Referral Line 6-5800 Registration 866-211-6588 Registrar's office 6-2119 Security 6-2121 IT Help Desk 6-5085 Care Clinics Medical Group 617-724-6610 IMA 1A IMA 4B 5 6 IMA 7 617-724-2700 IMA 8 617-726-2368 IMA 9 617-726-8157 IMA 10 617-724-4600 Massachusetts General Medical Group 617-724-8059 Medical Walk -In Unit 617-726-2707 MGH Back Chelsea 100 Everett Avenue 617-889-8580 MGH Downtown 617-728-6000 MGH Everett Family Care 617-394-7500 MGH Associates Waltham 781-487-4040 MGH Revere 300 Broadway 781-485-1000 MGH Revere 300 Ocean MGH Senior Health MGH West (Waltham) 781-487-4300 MGH Health Associates 617-724-6700 Waterfront Subspecialties Allergy / Immunology 6-3850 Anticoagulation (AMS) 6-2768 Boston Healthcare for the Homeless 781-221-6565 Brace Shop (White 10) 6-3248 Breast Center 6-9200 Orthopedics 6-2784 Pain Service (Acute) - peri-op/trauma 6-8810 Pain (Chronic) p17246 Palliative 6-3487 Poison Control (ingestion) 617-232-2120 Psychiatry 4-5600 4-7792 Mass Eye and Ear Infimary Page Operator 617-523-7900 Direct Dial to MGH from MEEI 87 + last 5 digits of MGH # Emergency Room 617-523-7900 x3240 11th floor (Inpatient) 617-573-3202 Ophthalmology Consult p23555 or 617 - 573-3412 opt 3 See \" Radiology\" Section for additional Radiology contact information 252Logistics NWH Directory Lau- floor) 6587 3 West Usen 4 West 6400 6 Usen 6095 Nuclear / Night 617-732-5657 Cardiac Studies ECG 6229 Echo 6231 / 2665 ETT or Nuclear Stress 5375 / 6229 / 6087 Ancillary Staff Nursing Supervisor p57711 Pharmacy 6012 Respiratory Therapy 6213 Phlebotomy 5903 Speech 1230 Infusion Clinic Office South) 6467 Chief Medical Resident 6470 Outside Calls 617-243-6841 Getting to NWH (2014 Washington St , Newton, MA) You will receive transportation information prior to your NWH rotation Note that all transportation stipends are taxed Driving o Stipend covers gas and tolls o On day 1, park in patient garage for ~$10 o Pay $15 cash/check at parking/security office for pass to park in employee garage behind West Entrance Ride-sharing o If using a ride- sharing service, consider carpooling to stay within stipend Public transportation o Take MBTA Gr een Line D outbound train to Riverside -> Woodland stop - > NWH is 2 blocks to the left Single day/night coverage (eg: NF coverage, HIT) o Use Uber for Business MGH DOM Internal Medicine Residency Program account 253 "}
