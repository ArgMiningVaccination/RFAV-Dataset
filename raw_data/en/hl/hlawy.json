Article Received on 11/05/2020 Article Revised on 01/06/2020 Article A ccepted on 22/06/2020 INTRODUCTION In Ayurveda though the disease COVID -19 is not directly mentioned but its sign and symptom resembles in certain disease according to Ayurveda . Acharya Caraka said 5000 yrs back that there will be many diseas es in future which will called Aviskritamroga and can be nomenclature according to Karana (causative factor), Dosha (humors of body), Dushya (bodily tissue), (loation of diseases) and Linga (sign and symptoms) etc.[1] COVID -19 is such a disease which can be categorized under Pranavahasrotas diseases according to its sign and symptoms. Till now it spreads million of people all over the world and it declar ed as pandemic which was told as Janapadodhwamsa in Ayurveda . According to Susruta it is a Aupasargikvyadhi means it is a communicable disease. A group of spherical or pleomorphic enveloped RNA viruses, carrying petal or club shaped plemorph on their surface has been classified as Corona viruses. Previous outbreaks of coronaviruses (CoVs) include the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -CoV. In November 2002 the Guangdong province in China experienced an outbreak of an unusual respiratory infections with many death. The world outside knew about it only in 2003 when a physician from Guangdong vi sited Hongkong, fell ill and died there, after affecting 12 person who stayed in the same hotel .[2] Later than in late 2019, the same disease named COVID -19 emerged again, where the e picentre was in Wuhan city of South China. SARS spreads by inhalation of the virus present in droplets or aerosols of respiratory secretions of patients. Fecal aerosols also may be infectious. The incubation period is under 10 days. The disease starts as fever with cough or other respiratory symptoms. Diarrhea is sometimes see n. The chest radiograph shows pneumonic changes. Death is due to respiratory failure.[3] Pathogenesis Patients infected with COVID -19 showed higher leukocyte numbers, abnormal respiratory findings, and increased levels of plasma pro -inflammatory cytokines . One of the COVID -19 case reports showed a patient at 5 days of fever presented with a cough, coarse breathing sounds of both lungs, and a body temperature of 39.0 \u00b0C. The patient's sputum showed positive real -time polymerase chain reaction results that c onfirmed COVID -19 infection . The laboratory studies \u00d7 10^9 cells/L neutrophils. value of 16.16 mg/L of blood C -reactive protein was noted which is above the normal range (0 -10 mg/L). High erythrocyte sedimentation rate and D -dimer were also observed . The main pathogenesis of COVID -19 infection as a respiratory system targeting virus was severe pneumonia, RNAaemia, combined with the incidence of ground -glass opacities, and ac ute cardiac injury. Significantly high blood levels of cytokines and chemokines were noted in patients with COVID -19 that JOURNAL AND MEDICAL RESEARCH www.ejpmr.com ejpmr, 2020,7( 7), 321-325 ABSTRACT Corona Virus or COVID -19 is creating a great havoc all over the globe. It is a worldwide epidemic. Since no medicine or vaccine has been discovered so various preventive measures should be followed to keep this vaccine at the bay. Ayurveda has mentioned about Janapadadhwamsa way before. It has been clearly mentioned that the four factors for causing epidemic are Vayu , Jala, Desha and Kala . The treatment principle are also mentioned in various classics like following the Sadvritta , taking Rasayana therapy as prophylaxis, performing Panchakarma . However Nidanparivarjana is the first thing that should be followed. The symptoms showed in COVID -19 can be correlated with the various diseases that come under Pranavahasrota that is Swasaroga, Kasaroga etc.Various single herbs are mentioned for Pranavahasrota which can be helpful in COVID Regional Ayurveda Research Institute for GID, Guwahati. www.ejpmr.com Das et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical R esearch 322 MIP1, MIP1, PDGFB, TNF, and VEGFA. Some of the severe cases that were admitted to the intensive care unit showed high levels of pro to promote disease severity .[4] Transmission Several repo rts have suggested that person -to-person transmission is a likely route for spreading COVID -19 infection. This is supported by cases that occurred within families and among people who did not visit the wet animal market in Wuhan. Person -to-person transmiss ion occurs primarily via direct contact or through droplets spread by coughing or sneezing from an infected individual. In a small study conducted on women in their third trimester who were confirmed to be infected with the coronavirus, there was no eviden ce that there is transmission from mother to child. However, all pregnant mothers underwent cesarean sections, so it remains unclear whether transmission can occur during vaginal birth. This is important because pregnant mothers are relatively more suscept ible to infection by respiratory pathogens and severe pneumonia .[5] AIM AND OBJECTIVE An effort has been made to find possible Ayurvedic comparison to the current most prevalent communicable diseases , COVID -19. Conceptual Study utbreaks, epidemics and pandemics had mentioned in Ayurvedic classics 5000 yrs back . In the Charaka Samhita Vimansthan (one of the principle textbooks of Ayurveda ) both the concept epidemics and pandemics are clea rly described together with its preventive aspects. In Ayurveda pandemics ar e Janapadodhwamsa roga. Coronavirus is an example of Janapadodhvansaroga . Due to the vitiation of the factors which are common to the population, produces same signs and symptoms result in the manifestation of sam e disease causing death to a community can be termed as Janapadodhwamsa .[6] In classic it is mentioned that which are common to the entire population, air, water, place/ habitat and the time period forms the responsible factors for the manifestation of Janapadodhwamsa (~communicable disease ). Feature of vitiation of these factors has also been clea rly explained in our science. Classification is based on the severity. Diseases arisi ng due to vitiation of Jala(water) is more severe than arising due to vitiat ion of Vayu (air) and less severe than Desha (place) . Diseases arising due to vitiation of Kala (particular time period) is more severe than Desha (place).[7] Aupasargic Roga : According to Ayurveda Aupasargic Roga c an be compared to contagious diseases in contemporary science, According to WHO contagious or infectious diseases, are caused by microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, parasites and fungi that can be spread, directly or indirectly, from one person to another. Some are transmitted through bites f rom insects while others are caused by ingesti ng contaminated food or water. Acharya Susruta elaborate ve ry nicely the mode of spread of Aupasargic Roga . It can be spread ed by one person to another by.[8] Gatrasamprasa (Frequent contact of the body of the patient ) Niswasa (inhaling his expired air ) Sahabhojanat (dining together with the patient ) Sahasa yasan (sleeping and sitting together with the patient ). Vastramalaanulepana (wearing dress, garlands and unguents used by the patient ) Pranvahasrotas The huma n body contains several channels through which the Doshas, Dhatus and Malas travel which are called as Srotamsi .[9] These are t he basic th ing of Ayurveda . Acharya Charak had explained Srotas as medicinal point of view while acharya sushrut had explained Srotas according to surgical aspect. There are thirteen Abhyantrasrotamsi , each of which relates to specific organs, and are increased and vitiated by specific factors .[10] Pranavahasr otas is first & important Srota , which carry Pran (vital things) all over body. Vitiation of Pranavaha Srotas include suppression of one's natural urges; seasonal, environmental, lifestyle and dietary patterns that are Ruksha , Sita in nature; exertion and exercise while hungry etc. they produce different symptoms like Kasa, Sv asa, Hikka etc.[11] Its Mulasthana (origin), Dustilakshana (sign and symptom after vitiation) are related to respiratory system. Pranavahasrotas is impotant & main srotas of the body. It starts from nose upto alveoli via external nares, nasal chambers, p harynx, trachea, bronchus & bronchioles, which carry oxygen or carbon dioxide to and from the lungs. From lungs these gases are transported to heart through pulmonary veins. From heart oxygen is supplied to a ll cells of body . In this process heart plays a very impo rtant role so heart is considered as Mulsthana of Pranavahasrotas . The gaseous path and exchange occurs nose to alveoli, alveoli to heart by pulmonary veins, heart to all cells of body by arteries, again from all cells to heart wi th the help of veins. Th is path occurs through Pranavahini Dhaman i. After vitiation Pranvahasrota cannot work properly and leads signs and symptoms like increase of expiratory rate, whishing sounds during respiration, painful www.ejpmr.com Das et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical R esearch 323 breathing and tightening of chest . Commentrat or of Susruta , Dalhana says that When this srotas vitiate then following symptoms are seen croshan which means to cry, winaman means to bend forward, b hram ana means vertigo, mohana means unconsciousness, vepenani means tremors of the part of body Possible aspects of Ayur vedic preventive measure and Management for Covid-19 Ayurvedic treatments may not helpful to cure corona virus infection. But the Ayurvedic holistic approach to keep health of healthy person which we can say indirectly to prevent develop a diseases is the key for this pandemic. Ayurveda emphasizes remain abstain from causative factors and improving immunity through proper diet, drugs , sleep, lifestyle, yogasan, pranayam etc. Nidanparivarjan Prohibition on restraint fro m Nidan constitutes the real treatment of disease. Acahrya Sushruta emphasizes that the sum of all kind of Chikitsa in a particular disease is Nidanparivarjan i.e. by removing the Karan or Hetu the manifestation of disease get dissolved itself.[13] It is the first principle of Chikitsha Sutra . It is a communiable disease and according to Ayurveda it comes under Sangkramikroga . The causes of transmission as described above should be avoided at first. It means we should keep social distance means should not touch or remain close to the diseased person, avoid dining, sitting with the infected person, to avoid from droplet infection we should keep cover the mouth, should not share cloths, cosmetics with the diseases person. Pranvahasrota so here Vaman and Virechan is applicable. Cakradutta has clearly mentioned in Hikkaswasa chapter tha t Vaman and Virechan is applicable here as Panchakarma . Samshamana chikit sa Proper administration of Rasayana therpies is advised in the effective management of communicable diseases which is described in Janapadodhwamsa .[15] Importance of Rasayana According to Kalpadruma Rasayana means Rasaraktadi Dhatus (the bodily tissues) get their proper nourishment of tissues by Poshaka Rasa . Sushrut said about Rasayana that helps in delaying aging process, increases longevity, and intelligence and help to develop resistant power against diseases.[16] Charaka said that Rasayana makes the dhatus of optimum quality.[17] The benefits of Rasayana are that it gives optimum body strength physically and against diseases, good complexion, good voice and body glow. Promotes mental health, provides good memory and intellect , good power of senses , provides good life span, Helps to fight against as well as curing the diseases. Rasayana act by , direct enrichment of the nutrient quality by p romoting agni vyapara (increases digestive fire), by providing competence to the channels or passages . Naimittik a Rasayana is disease specific Rasayana which is one among the classification of Rasayana mentioned by Sushruta, . It is having Vyadhiharana property it can mitigates diseases .[18] Few Naimittika Rasayana explaine d in different classics according to d iseases . Rasayana drugs are available in our classics in different disorders with special interactions with the RasavahaSrotas. Administration of these Rasayana in proper way in different Vyadhis along with the prescribed medicatio n will provide a fruitful result . During using Rasayana it should be kept in mind the Desha (place), Kala (season) and Prakri ti (body constitution) of the patient. This Rasayana can be used as preventive aspect to different problems facing in the current pandemic communicable disease. For any condition affecting Pranavahasrotas (respiratory channels) one should apply the treatment protocols recommended for Shvasaroga , Kasaroga Chikitsa \u2014 breathing difficulty , cough, and related disorders. In Brihatrayeekaras a wide range of herbs for the treatment of PranavahaSroto roga is found , in Charaka Samhita around 30 dru gs are found 3 categories under Kasahara, Svasahara Svasa drugs under different Ganas like Surasadi and Vidarigandhadiganas .21 again differe nt Swashara and Kasahara drugs are mentioned in their respective treatments in different chapters . Among these the drugs www.ejpmr.com Das et al. European Journal of Pharmaceutical and Medical R esearch 324 like, Puskaramoola , Tulsi, Abhaya, Trikatu, Sati, Brihati, Kantakari, Tamalaki, are treatment of dif ferent Pranavaha Srota Roga . DISCUSSION As COVID 19 is proving to the world, tiny viruses are powerful biological agents, capable of rapidly effecting massive damage and fatality. Yet they are so simple: a virus is merely comprised of pieces of genetic ma terial either RNA or DNA - wrapped in a protein envelope, which is known as a Capsid. Yet this tiny organism carries with it a mortality rate (death rate) or about 10 % for people over 70 years of age and 22% for those over 80. Many people have claimed va rious measures for preventing COVID 19 virus to the respiratory tract cells. Drinking warm water, doing pranayama, meditation will protect against infection. The symptom of COVID 19 includes fever, breathing difficulty, cough, sore throat, loss of appetite , diarrhea these symptoms can very well correlated under the diseases mentioned in Pranavahasrota that is swasa, kasa and hikka. The treatment principle mentioned like nidanparivarjan that is avoiding the cause so one should wash hands repeatedly, cover fa ce with masks, covering face while coughing, sneezing should be done. Sanshodhanchikitsa that is administration of panchakarma which is very well mentioned in hikkaswaschikitsa of CharakSamhita and janapadadhwamsachapter.Samshamanachikitsa includes rasayan a therapy which acts as immunity boosting. A number of drugs are also mentioned in various cl assics for treating paranavahasrota diseases. CONCLUSION In this review article, an attempt has been made to find out the most possible treatment principle that c an be given in this global pandemic . Ayurveda has long ago mentioned about janapadadhwamsa and its treatment. Though at present no vaccine or medicin e has been discovered for COVID -19 but Ayurveda has always given importance to the preventive aspect. So if one follows the various preventive measures mentioned than defiantly we can overcome this global pandemic very soon. REFFERENCES 1. Charak Samhita 1, Ch/Su/20/3: 391. 2.
