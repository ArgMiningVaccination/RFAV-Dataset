This systematic review was conducted as part of the Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project (P/B -24 Project) by USDA's Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review (NESR). The purpose of the P/B -24 Project was to conduct a series of systematic reviews on diet and health for women who are pregnant and for infants and toddlers from birth to 24 months of age. This project was a joint initiati ve led by USDA and HHS, and USDA's NESR carried out all of the systematic reviews. A Federal Expert Group (FEG), a broadly representative group of Federal researchers and program leaders , also provided input throughout the P/B -24 Project. More information about the P/B -24 Project has been published2 and is NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/project -specific -overview -pb-24-0 NESR, formerly the Library (NEL), specializes in conducting food- and nutrition- related systematic reviews using a rigorous , protocol -driven methodology . To conduct each P/B -24 systematic review, NESR's staff worked with a Technical Expert Collaborative (TEC) , which is a group of 7- 8 leading subject matter experts . NESR's systematic review methodology involves developing and prioritizing systematic review questions, searching for and selecting studies, extracting and assessing the risk of bias of data from each included study, synthesizing the evidence, developing a conclusion statement, grading the evidence underlying the conclusion statement, and recommending future research. A detailed description of the methodology used in conducting systematic reviews for the P/B -24 Project has been published3 and is available on the NESR website: https://nesr.usda.gov/pb- 24-project -methodology -0. In addition, starting on page 62, this document includes details about the methodology as it was applied to the systematic review described herein. An analytic framework that illustrates the overall scope of the question, including the population, the interventions and/or exposures, comparators, and outcomes of interest, is found on page 62. In addition, the literature search plan , that was used to identify studies included in this systematic review is found on page 63. 2 Stoody EE, Spahn JM, Cassavale KO.

PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY What is the question? What is the relationship between the types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages consumed and growth, size, and body composition? What is the answer to the question? Moderate evidence indicates that higher versus lower meat intake or meat versus iron- fortified cereal intake over a short duration (~3mo) during the complementary feeding period does not favorably or unfavorably influence growth, size, and/or body composition. There is insufficient evidence to determine a relationship between meat intake and pr evalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. Limited evidence suggests that type or amount of cereal given does not favorably or unfavorably influence growth, size, body composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. Moderate evidence suggests that consumption of complementary foods with different fats and/or fatty acid composition does not favorably or unfavorably influence growth, size, or body composition. There is not enough evidence to determine a relationship between consumption of complementary foods with different fats and/or fatty acid composition and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. Limited evidence suggests that sugar sweetened beverage consumption during the complementary feeding period is associated with increased risk of obesity in childhood, but is not associated with other measures of growth, size, and body composition. Limited evidence showed a positive association between juice intake and infant weight -for-length and child BMI z -scores. No conclusion c ould be made about the relationship between other complementary foods (vegetables, fruit, dairy products and/or cow's milk, cereal -based products, milk -cereal drink, and/or categories such as \"ready - made foods\") and growth, size, body composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. No conclusion could be made about the relationship between distinct dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period and growth, size, body composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of malnutrition, over weight or obesity. 11 Why was this question asked? This important public question was identified as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project How was this question answered? A team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review conducted a systematic review in collaboration with a group of experts called a Technical Expert Collaborative. What is the population of interest? Generally healthy infants and toddlers who were fed complementary foods and beverages from ages 0- 24 months and had growth, size, and/or body composition outcomes measured across the lifespan What evidence was found? Forty -nine articles were included that addressed type and/or amount of complementary foods and beverages consumed, including the introduction of specific complementary foods and beverages and dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period. The study designs included 18 randomized controlled trials, 1 non- randomized controlled trial, and 30 prospective cohort studies The studies varied in terms of the types and/or amounts of CFB examined, which included dietary patterns consumed during the complementary feeding period, meat, cereal, foods with different fatty acid com position, SSB, juice or 100% juice, and other CFB The gaps and limitations in the evidence may include the following: o Randomized controlled trials and studies that examine a wider range of specific types and amounts complementary foods and beverages, o Research that account s for the rationale for type/amount of complementary foods and beverages given (e.g., reverse causality), and adjust s for potential confounders (e.g., human milk and/or formula -feeding and baseline growth status). How up -to-date is this review? This review includes literature from 01/1980 to 07/2016 12 TECHNICAL ABSTRACT Background The goal of this systematic review was to examine the following question: What is the relationship between types and amounts of complementary foods and bever ages (CFB) consumed and growth, size, and body composition? Systematic reviews were conducted as part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Department of Health and Human Services Pregnancy and Birth to 24 Months Project. Complementary feeding is the process that starts when human milk or infant formula is complemented by other foods and beverages, beginning during infancy and typically continuing to 24 months of age. CFB were defined as foods and/or beverages other than human milk or infant formula (l iquids, semisolids, and solids) provided to an infant or young child to provide nutrients and energy. Conclusion Statement Moderate evidence indicates that higher versus lower meat intake or meat versus iron- fortified cereal intake over a short duration (~3mo) during the complementary feeding period does not favorably or unfavorably influence growth, size, and/or body composit ion. There is insufficient evidence to determine a relationship between meat intake and prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. Limited evidence suggests that type or amount of cereal given does not favorably or unfavorably influence growth, size, body composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. Moderate evidence suggests that consumption of complementary foods with different fats and/or fatty acid composition does not favorably or unfavorably influence growth, size, or body composition. There is not enough evidence to determine a relationship between consumption of complementary foods with different fats and/or fatty acid composition and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. Limited evidence suggests that sugar sw eetened beverage consumption during the complementary feeding period is associated with increased risk of obesity in childhood, but is not associated with other measures of growth, size, and body composition. Limited evidence showed a positive association between juice intake and infant weight -for-length and child BMI z -scores. No conclusion could be made about the relationship between other complementary foods (vegetables, fruit, dairy products and/or cow's milk, cereal -based products, milk -cereal drink, and/or categories such as \"ready - made foods\") and growth, size, body composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. No conclusion could be made about the relationship between distinct dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period and growth, size, body 13 composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of malnutrition, overweight or obesity. Grades: Moderate - Meat; Different Fats and/or Fatty Acid Composition; Limited - Juice; -Sweetened Beverages; Grade Not Assignable - Cereal; Other CFB; Dietary Patterns Methods This systematic review was conducted by a team of staff from the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review in collaboration with a Technical Expert Collaborative. Literature search was conducted using 4 databases (PubMed, C ochrane, Embase, and CINAHL) to identify articles that evaluated the intervention or exposure of t ypes and amounts of CFB consumed and the outcomes of growth, size, and/or body composition. A manual search was conducted to identify articles that may not have been included in the electronic databases searched. Articles were screened by two analysts independently for inclusion based on pre- determined criteria. Data extraction and risk of bias assessment were conducted for each included study, and both were c hecked for accuracy. The body of evidence was qualitatively synthesized to inform development of a conclusion statement(s), and the strength of evidence was graded using pre- established criteria evaluating the body of evidence on risk of bias, adequacy, consistency, impact, and generalizability. Summary of the Evidence This review includes 49 articles from 18 randomized controlled trials, 1 non- randomized controlled trial, and 30 prospective cohort studies The studies varied in terms of the types and/or am ounts of CFB examined, which included dietary patterns consumed during the complementary feeding period, meat, cereal, foods with different fatty acid composition, sugar - sweetened beverages, juice or 100% juice, and other CFB Gaps and limitations in the evidence include the need for randomized controlled trials and studies that examine a wider range of specific types and amounts complementary foods and beverages, account for the rationale for type/amount of complementary foods and beverages given (e.g., reverse causality), and adjust for potential confounders (e.g., human milk and/or formula -feeding and baseline growth status). 14 FULL REVIEW Systematic review question What is the relationship between the types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages consumed and growth, size, and body composition?

Grades Moderate - Meat; Different Fats a nd/or Fatty Acid Composition; Limited Assignable - Cere al; Other CFB; Dietary Patterns 15 Summary This review includes 49 studies that examined the association between types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages (CFB) and growth, size, body composition, and/or overweight or obesity status including: o 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) o One non-RCT o 30 prospective cohort studies The types and amounts of CFB consumed during the complementary feeding (CF) period that were examined varied across studies. The types of CFB included meat, fortified and unfortified cereal, foods with different fats and/or fatty-acid composition, sugar -sweetened beverages (SSBs), juice drinks and/or 100% juice, and other CFB (e.g., fruits, vegetables, eggs, fish). o Distinct dietary patterns during the CF period were also examined but difficult to compare o Introduction of specific types of CFB was also examined but varied widely (e.g., SSB <6mo vs. never; ground meat/soy product <3, 4- 6, >6mo) Growth, size, and body composition outcomes varied across studies. These outcomes included weight, length/height, body circumferences (e.g., head, arm, chest, waist), fat mass (FM) , lean mass, weight -to-height ratio (e.g., body mass index (BMI), weight -for-length z-score (WLZ)), and/or incidence/frequency/prevalence/risk of malnutrition, overweight, or obesity measured either at a single time point or change over time. The relationship between the types and/or amounts of CFB and grow th, size, and/or body composition remains unclear. o In many cases, the amount of CFB provided would not be expected to affect these outcomes over the limited duration of time in which it was tested or how long after the intervention subjects were followed- up o Given the normal variation in healthy child growth patterns, caution should be used when interpreting results between timing, types and amounts of CFB and outcomes for individuals based on findings at the population level. Additional factors that need to be considered when examining the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB and growth, size, and/or body composition outcomes include: o Early infant milk feeding practices (human milk, formula, and/or mixed) o Variability of normal early infant growth patterns o Parental feeding styles and the rationale for choosing specific types of CFB (e.g., perceived infant readiness, infant growth or size, fear of inadequate milk supply, sleep promotion, responsive feeding, infant food neophobia/acceptance) o Cultural preference related to parental history and/or feeding practices Description of the evidence This SR includes 49 studies that examined the association between the types and 16 amounts of CFB and growth, size, and body composition. The study designs in this review included 18 RCTs (1 -18), one of which was a cross -over design (1) , one non-RCT (19), and 30 prospective cohort studies (20- 49) (Supplemental Table S 1). Multiple articles used the same cohorts but represented different outcomes, different exposures, or exposures/outcomes at different ages (41, 42, 40, 49, 51, 56, 32, 50, 31, 38, 39). Description of subject characteristics The studies included in this SR enrolled both girls and boys (~29- 67% females) who were healthy, full -term infants According to the Human Development Index (50), 37 articles were from studies conducted in countries categorized as \" very high\", and 12 articles were from studies conducted in countries categorized as \"high. While most studies did not describe the race/ethnicity of subjects, they were all conducted in representative populations from the countries in which they were conducted. A number of studies enrolled infants who were exclusively breastfed (EBF (4, 11- 15, 17) or exclusively formula- fed (EFF (1, 9) up to at least 4 mo of age. The remaining studies varied in terms of whether infants were fed human milk, infant formula, or both and most adjusted for feeding method (e.g., BF duration) in analyses. Description of types and amounts of complementary foods and beverages The types of CFB commonly examined in these studies included meats, fortified and unfortified cereals/porridges, foods that varied in fats or fatty acid profiles, and sugar -sweetened beverages (SSBs), juice drinks, and 100% fruit juice. In most cases, cereal refers to infant cereals that were fortified with iron (Fe), and variably fortified with additional micronutrients (e.g., zinc). Fewer studies examined other foods and/or food groups such as fruit and/or vegetable snacks, biscuits, fried potatoes, confectionary or sweetened foods, home- based CFB (prepared with a blender according to a provided recipe), and self -made vs. ready -made CFB. Types and amounts of CFB were analyzed in several ways, such as different types of CFB, different amounts of the same CFB, by age of introduction of specific CFB, and dietary patterns during the CF period (Supplemental Table S 1). The included articles were categorized according to how types and/or amounts of CFB were assessed: Meat, with or without cereal (2, 3, 5, 11, 14, 15, 18, 32, 33, 39, 44, 49) . These studies examined meat as a CFB, including meat intake compared to another CFB such as cereal, the amount of meat c onsumed, or meat introduction; Cereal (9, 11, 17, 35, 38, 49) . These studies examined cereal(s), including different types of cereal, amount of cereal, or timing of cereal intake. Several articles randomized groups to receive meat vs. cereal, or meat and cereal vs. control. Those studies are not discussed in the \"cereal\" section to avoid redundancy with the \"meat with or without cereal\" section; CFB with different fats and/or fatt y acid composition (4, 6, 10, 13) . These studies ex amined different types of CFB including fish and egg that naturally 17 contain or were manipulated to contain different amounts or types of fat; SSBs (26, 31- 33, 38, 40, 43, 45) . These studies examined either amount or timing of SSBs consumed during the CF period; Juice drinks and/or 100% juice (31 -33, 38, 43, 45) . These studies examined the consumpti on of juice, which may or may not have contained added sugar. Studies examined the amount or timing of juice, included 100% juice, juice drinks, and/or other beverages, during the CF period; Other CFB (8, 16, 19, 21, 22, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36- 38, 43, 44, 48, 49) (7, 8, 19, 21, 22, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36- 38, 43, 44, 49) . These remaining studies examined other or multiple CFB, which were not addressed in the aforementioned categories (e.g., vegetables, ready -made foods, confectionary foods); Dietary patterns (12, 20, 23- 25, 27, 28, 34, 41, 42, 46, 47) . These studies examined dietary patterns during the CF period classif ied either by observation (e.g., macrobiotic diet) or statistical analyses (e.g., adherence scores for patterns derived from latent class, cluster, or principal component analysis). Description of growth, size, and body composition outcomes Outcomes that were reported in relation to types and amounts of CFB consumed included growth, size, and body composition at various ages, ranging from birth to 42 y (Supplemental Table S 1). The majority of studies reported that standard procedures were used to obtain weight and height (e.g., measured from calibrated scales/stadiometers) and were assessed within the first two years of life (1, 3 -9, 11, 12, 14, 15, 18, 19, 23, 24, 28, 36, 39, 48) . However, a few studies obtained weight and/or length or height via maternal -report (31, 42, 47, 49) , clinical records (2, 37) , unstandardized or various methods (38, 44) , or did not specifically report their methods (10, 13, 17, 20) . Nineteen studies determined BMI, BMI trajectory, BMIZ, and/or WLZ from measured (5, 9, 14, 15, 21, 25, 28, 29, 32- 34, 38, 41, 43, 45) or reported (42, 44, 47, 49) , weight and length. Eleven studies assessed adiposity according to fat mass (FM) and/or lean mass measured by skinfold thickness (3, 4, 22, 23, 28, 30, 36) body dual-energy X adiposity, either waist circumference ( WC) or abdominal fat (14, 26, 29, 33, 34, 44) measured using flexible tape (26, 33, 34) , ultrasound (29), self -report (44), or non- specified methods (14) . Four teen studies reported head circumference (HC) (1, 4, 5, 7, 9- 12, 15, 18, 24, 28, 36, 39) and six reported mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) (1, 3, 7, 12, 28, 36) .Seven studies assessed overweight or obesity (20, 26, 29, 40, 42, 44, 49) , using standards according to BMI or WLZ. Two studies assessed malnutrition outcomes (e.g., wasting, stunting) (28, 46). Evide nce s ynthesis Results from the included studies are described accordi ng to specific CFB in Tables 1-6, placed after each respective section. Twenty -four of the 49 articles reported 18 one or more significant associations, either positive, negative, or mixed, between types or amounts of CFB and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of malnutrition, overweight or obesity (5, 14, 15, 19, 21, 23, 27, 28, 30- 34, 37- 42, 44- 47, 49) . Twenty -five of the 49 articles found no relationship between types and amounts of CFB and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity (1-4, 6-13, 16- 18, 20, 22, 24- 26, 29, 35, 36, 43, 48) . Meat Twelve articles, including sev en RCTs (2, 3, 5, 11, 14, 15, 18) and five articles from four observational studies (32, 33, 39, 44, 49) examined the relationship bet ween meat intake and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity outcomes. Studies varied in terms of whether they assessed meat compared to cereal, meat and cereal compared to controls, or the amount of meat consumed (see Table 1). Krebs et al. (5) reported that BF infants consuming meat compared to Fe- fortified cereal from 5- 7 mo had a significantly greater rate of HC growth from 7- 12 mo, but no significant differences in HC growth 4- 7 mo, weight -for-length 4- 7 mo or 7 -12 mo, weight growth rate at 4- 7 mo or 7- 12 mo, WAZ 4- 12 mo, length growth rate 4- 7 mo or 7- 12 mo, or LAZ 4- 12 mo. Tang et al. (15) reported that Chinese infants randomly assigned to the meat vs. cereal groups had a smaller decline in WAZ, smaller decline in LAZ and greater increase in length from 6- 18 mo but no significant differences in WLZ or in HC, or HC z -score from 6- 18 mo. Tang and Krebs (14) also reported that U.S. infants randomly assigned to meat vs. cereal groups had significantly greater mean change in WAZ and LAZ from 5- 9 mo, but there were no differences between groups in WLZ or BMIZ from 5- 9 mo or in WC at 9 mo of age. In two other RCTs, there were no significant group differences in weight, length, or HC in the first year of lif e between those who received meat and Fe-fortified cereal relative to control groups (11, 18) . Two RCTs found no relationship between amount of meat consumed and growth, size, or body composition outcomes prior to 10 mo of age (2, 3) . Three articles from two observational studies also examined meat intake (32, 33, 39) . Garden et al. (33) and Garden et al. (32) reported significant positive associations between meat intake at 18 mo and BMI trajectory (i.e., 'early and persistent', 'late increase', or 'normal' according to C DC percentile curves) at different ages, 8 y and birth- 11.5 y (in boys only). Morgan et al. (39) found that meat intake from 4- 12 mo was significantly associated with higher weight gain from 4- 12 mo but this did not persist in the fully -adjusted models or at older age intervals (4- 16 mo, 4- 24 mo), and there was no association with length or HC outcom es. Meat introduction. Two observational studies examined the introduction of meat (44, 49). Zheng et al. (49) reported no significant association between age of ground meat/soy introduction and overweight or obesity or BMI at age 4- 5 y. Schack - Nielsen et al. (44) found that, among other relationships identified, later introduction of meat was associated with decreased BMI and risk of overweight at 42 y, but not at 20- 34 y of age. 19 Table 1.

Three articles from RCTs examined cereal as a CFB in relation to multiple outcomes, including body composition, weight, length, and HC prior to 18mo of age (1, 9, 17) (see Table 2). Davidsson et al. (1) reported no differences in a cross -over trial with EFF infants receiving specially -developed weani ng cereals that were fortified to match commercially -available fortified cereals made with wheat/soy or wheat/milk for 4 wk each and weight, length, HC, or arm or chest circumference at 7- 17 wk. Lonnderdal and Chen (9) reported no differences between EFF infants receiving 25g/d of cereal (fortification not specified) vs. no cereal from age 4- 7 mo and weight -for-height, skinfold thickness, weight gain, length gain, or HC from 4- 7 mo of age. Walter et al. (17) reported no differences between EBF infants, who were randomized at 4 mo to receive 30 g/d of Fe- fortified vs. non -fortified cereal, in weight or length at 8, 12, or 15 mo of age. Three articles from observational studies (35, 38, 49) also examined the relationship between cereal as a CFB and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity outcomes (see Table 3). Hertrampf et al. (35) reported no significant differences between infants consuming Fe- fortified cereal compared to routine CFB (including cereal that was not specified as fortified) from ~3- 6 mo and weight at 8 or 12 mo of age. Using data from the PROBIT trial, Kramer et al. (38) found that any intake of cereal (non- fortified adult' cereals) vs. none at 3 mo of age was associated with lower WAZ, LAZ and HC from 3 -6 mo of age, but not with WLZ at any time point (38) . Kramer et al. (38) reported no significant associations between cereal intake and outcomes at either 6- 9 mo or 9- 12 mo of age. Finally, Zheng et al. (49) found no significant associations between introduction to rice cereal/porridge and risk of either overweight or obesity at age 4- 5 y. 25 Table 2.

Outcomes w ere organized for practicality into columns: weight status, body composition, weight, length or height, and head circumferenc e. Results described in the respective columns are based on outcome similarity and in accordance with the analytical framework a s follows: Weight status included risk/incidence/prevalence/frequency of malnutrition, healthy weight, overweight, or obesity; Body comp osition included measures, indices, and proxies of overall adiposity such as lean mass, fat mass (FM), % body fat, weight -to-height ratios such as BMI, BMIZ, WLZ, central adiposity or waist circumference, and arm or thigh circumferences; Weight included weight -specific measures such as weight -for-age z -score (WAZ), Length or Height included length- specific measures such as len gth-for-age z -score (LAZ); Head circumference included head circumference Abbreviations: BF, breast -fed; CFB, complementary not reported; significant group differences; RCT, randomized controlled trial; WAZ, weight for age z -score; WLZ, weight for length z -score 27 CFB with different fat/fatty acid composition Table 3 descr ibes results from 4 RCTs, which examined the influence of CFB that varied in fatty acid profiles (4, 6, 10, 13) . No relationship was found between groups consuming CFB that differed in fatty acid content with respect to growth, size, or body c omposition outcomes . Hoffman et al. (4) found no significant differences between infants randomly assigned to receive one jar/d of CFB with or without egg- yolk for 6 mo (ages 6 -12 mo) in weight, length, skinfold thickness, or HC at 6, 9, or 12 mo of age. Libuda et al. (6) randomly assigned infants to receive rapeseed oil, salmon, or corn- oil from 4 -10 mo, but found no differences between groups in weight or length at 10 mo of age. Makrides et al. (10) randomly assigned infants (BF and/or FF) to consume eggs (~ 4/wk, regular or omega- 3 enriched) or receive no dietary intervention for 6 mo, and reported no differences in weight, length, or HC at 12 mo of age. Schwartz et al. (13) found no significant differences between infants randomly assigned to receive one jar/d of CFB with either rapeseed oil vs. corn oil with respect to weight at 10 mo or weight gain from 4 to 10 mo of age. 28 Table 3.

Outcomes were organized for practicality into columns: weight status, body composition, weight, length or height, and head ci rcumference. 29 Results described in the respective columns are based on outcome similarity and in accordance with the analytical framework as follows: Weight status included risk/incidence/prevalence/frequency of malnutrition, healthy weight, overweight, or obesity; Body comp osition included measures, indices, and proxies of overall adiposity such as lean mass, fat mass (FM), % body fat, weight -to-height ratios such as BMI, BMIZ, WLZ, central adiposity or waist circumference, and arm or thigh circumferences; Weight included weight -specific measures such as weight -for- age z -score (WAZ), Length or Height included length -specific measures such as length -for-age z -score (LAZ); Head circumference included head differen ces; RCT, randomized controlled trial 30 SSBs. Five articles examined SSB intake (26, 32, 33, 40, 43) (see Table 4).One article reported that any vs. no intake of SSBs, including during infancy was associated with higher prevalence of obesity at age 6 y and that higher frequency of SSB intake (3/wk vs. never) at age 10 -12 mo was associated with a 2- fold increase in odds of obesity at age 6 y (40) . In addition, SSB introduction before age 6 mo vs. never during infancy was associated with 92% higher odds of obesity at age 6 y. Four articles reported no association with BMI, BMIZ, odds of obesity or abdominal obesity (26, 32, 33, 43) . Specifically, there were no significant associations between intake of SSBs (which included cordials, fruit drinks, and soft drinks but excluded juice) at 18mo and BMI -trajectory at 8 y (33) or from birth -11.5 y (32) . Cantoral et al. (26) reported no significant association between SSB introduction (based on the sum of daily intake of soda, commercial fruit drinks, or flavored water with sugar exclusive of natural fruit juice) at or before 12 mo vs. after 12 mo of age and odds of obesity or abdominal obesity at age 8- 14 y. Santorelli et al. (43) found no significant association between introduction of S SBs, including cola, lemonade, sweetened tea and pre- prepared 'baby' drinks, before 17 wk and BMIZ at 3 y of age. Juice drinks and 100% fruit juice. Six articles examined jui ce consumption primarily at or <1y of age (31-33, 38, 43, 45) (see Table 4). Juice was inconsistently described and juice consumption was defined differently across studies as follows: any vs. no intake of 'juice or other liquids' at ages 1, 3, 6, or 9 mo of age (38) ; fluid oz/d of orange juice or 100% fruit juice at 0, 1 -7, 8-15,or >16 oz/d (31); and intake of \"non- milk beverages\" including juice,cordials, fruit drinks, and soft drinks (32, 33) . Two studies found significant positive associations between juice consumption and weight relative to length (38, 45) but both studies reported additional null results. Results from Kramer et al . show that intake of juice at 9 mo was associated with higher WLZ from 9- 12 mo of age but not WAZ, LAZ, or HC at any age (38) . Sonneville et al. (45) found that 8- 15 oz/d of fruit juice at 1 y vs. none was associated with increased BMIZ at 7.7 y, but lesser or greater amounts (1- 7 oz, or >16 oz/d) were not associated with BMI Z at 7.7 y. In addition, the amount of fruit juice at 1 y was not associated with BMIZ at 3.1 y in fully -adjusted models. Gaffney et al. (31) found that infants who were given greater amounts of juice (>1 serving of juice/2d vs. none) had significantly higher WAZ at 12 mo. However, there were no significant as sociations between lesser amounts (1 serving of juice/2d vs. none) and WAZ at 12 mo. Garden et al. (33) and Garden et al. (32) found no association between intake of non- milk beverages which included juice, cordials, fruit drinks, and soft drinks at 18 mo and BMI -trajectory at 8y (33) or from birth -11.5 y (32) . Collectively, the findings from these observational studies suggest positive associations but are inconsistent given the variation in the definitions and amounts of juice intake and outcomes at different ages. 31 Table 4.

The independent variable/exposure of interest included types and/or amounts of CFB, which encompassed dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period and timing of specific CFB; this section of studies examined sugar -sweetened beverage, juice drinks, and/or 100% juice. 3. Outcomes were organized for practicality int o columns: weight status, body composition, weight, length or height, and head circumference. Results described in the respective columns are based on outcome similarity and in accordance with the analytical framework a s follows: Weight status included ris k/incidence/prevalence/frequency of malnutrition, healthy weight, overweight, or obesity; Body composition included measures, indices, and proxies of overall adiposity such as lean mass, fat mass (FM), % body fat, weight -to-height ratios such as BMI, BMIZ, WLZ, central adiposity or waist circumference, and arm or thigh circumferences; Weight included weight -specific measures such as weight -for-age z -score (WAZ), Length or Height included length- specific measures such as length -for-age z -score (LAZ); Head circumference included head circumference not reported; significant randomized controlled trial; SSB, sugar - sweetened beverage; WAZ, weight for age z -score; WLZ, weight for length z -score 35 Other CFB Sixteen articles examined distinct types, amounts, groups, or introductions of other CFB (7, 8, 19, 21, 22, 27, 29, 30, 32, 33, 36- 38, 43, 44, 49) using different assessment methods and are des cribed in more detail in Table 5. These other CFB were examined during intervals or at specific ages, primarily between 4 and 12 mo, relative to various outcomes ranging in age from 4 mo up to 42 y. Although a few significant associati ons were identified (see Table 5), there was insufficient evidence, inconsistency, and substantial methodological limitations across these studies that prevented conclusions from being drawn. Types of Other CFB. Lind et al. (7) reported no differences between groups randomized to receive regular -phytate vs. reduced- phytate milk -cereal drink and porridge from 6- 12 mo in WAZ, LAZ, MUAC, or HC at 6, 12, or 18 mo of age (7) . Liu et al. (8) found no differences between BF infants and toddlers receiving a fortified (Fe, Zn, vitamin A, calcium, folic acid) or non- fortified biscuit daily for 3 mo in weight or length at ages 9- 16 mo of age. de Silva et al. (19) reported that infants who were assigned to receive 'home- based CFB' (i.e., a CFB made with common foods including red rice, red lentils, and vegetable oil) from 4- 12 mo had significantly greater weight gain from 4- 12 mo than those receiving mom's choice of CFB, but found no dif ferences in length gain 4- 12 mo of age. Virtanen et al. (16) found no significant differences between infants, who were randomly assigned to receive cow's milk that was either standard- fat, low -fat, or iron -fortified with either 50% vegetable fat and vitam in C, or 100% vegetable fat, with respect to weight at 18 mo, or weight change from 12- 18 mo of age. Almquist -Tangen et al. (21) found that MCD at 6 mo of age, but not porridge or semi -solid foods, was significantly associated with high BMI (>1SD) at 12 mo and 18 mo of age. However, several potential key confounders were not adjusted for in analyses (SES, race/ethnicity, feeding practices) and no other outcomes were examined that could inform the results. For instance, it is unknown whether high BMI was driven by gains in FM or weight or decreases in length percentiles. Carruth et al. (27) reported that consumption of meat, mixed food, and/or table food by age 8 mo was associated with a smaller weight change from age 2- 8 mo, al though this did not remain significant after adjusting for length slope. Ianotti et al. (36) reported no differences between infants consuming animal source foods (meat, fish, egg, or milk) or other CFB (cereal, mixed or blended foods, stews, bread or other cereal products) from 6- 12 mo of age with respect to MUAC, weight, length, or HC from 1 -12 mo of age. Kalies et al. (37) reported a significantly lower risk of elevated weight gain (difference between weight at birth and at 24 mo of age) among infants consuming 'ready -made' vs. 'self -made' foods. Santorelli et al. (43) found no significant association between intake of non- sweetened solid foods (e.g., baby rice, pureed vegetables, fruits or rice, and lentils/dhal) or sweetened foods (e.g. egg custard, rice pudding, sweetened rusks, biscuits and cake) and BMIZ at 3 y of age. Wosje et al. (48) found no significant differences between those consuming whol e-milk vs. 2% fat milk with respect to (absolute or change in) weight, length, and body fat from 12- 24 mo of age. 36 Amount of Other CFB . Two articles from one observational study mentioned previously (32, 33) examined intake in quintiles by weight and % total energy of additional CFB at 18 mo of age including dairy foods (milk, yogurt, cheese, ice cream, custard), milk (skim, whole and evaporated), fruits, vegetables, total extra foods (e.g., savory sauces, fats, and oils), fried potatoes, salty snacks (e.g., cheese snacks, corn chips), confectionary (e.g., chocolate, jellies), cereal foods, including bread, pasta, rice, and breakfast cereals and cereal -based products (e.g., cookies, cakes). In terms of significant findings, negative associations were identified between the amount of cereal -based products and dairy foods consumed and BMI at age 8 y. In addition, positive associations were identified between the amount of fruit intake and WC at 8 y of age. Although they did not reach significance, there were trends suggesting that greater intake of vegetables was associated with higher BMI at 8 y whereas greater intake of confectionary foods was associated with lower BMI at 8 y. The amount consumed of other remaining foods (e.g., milk, cereal - foods, fried potatoes; salty snacks) were not significantly associated with BMI in either analysis (32, 33) . Other CFB introduction. Three articles from one observational study (Generation R) examined the age of introduction to fruit or vegetable snacks (22, 29, 30) . Two articles found no significant associations between fruit or vegetable snack introduction and body composition (22, 29) . Durmus et al. (30) found that fruit or vegetable snack introduction at 4- 5 mo relative to >5 mo was significantly associated with greater thickness (total FM) at age 24 mo. Durmus et al. (30) found no other associations between introduction at <4, 4- 5, or >5 mo and other outcomes including total, peripheral, or central FM at 24 mo or odds of overweight or obesity at 6 y of age. Kramer et al. (38) found that intake of \"other solids\" (not described) at age 9 mo was associated with significantly lower LAZ from 9 -12 mo of age but found no association with WLZ, WAZ, or HC at any age interval. Carruth et al. (27) reported that age of vegetable introduction was associated with lower weight change from age 2- 8 mo in the final predictive model, although this did not remain significant after adjusting for length slope. Schack -Nielsen et al. (44) reported that later introduction of vegetables and firm food were significantly associated with decreased risk of overweight at 42 y but not with BMI at 20- 34 y. Later introduction of veget ables was associated with decreased BMI at 20- 34 y and 42 y. Associations between egg introduction (continuous) and overweight at ages 20- 34 y or 42 y were not significant. Introduction of firm food (bread and biscuits mixed with milk) was negatively assoc iated with BMIZ at age 1 y, 10 y and 11 y but this did not persist at 42 y. Later introduction of spoon- feeding (continuous) was not associated with risk of overweight at 42 y but was significantly associated with lower BMI at 42 y and smaller WC at 42 y. When examined categorically, there was a non-significant trend for later introduction ( 4 vs. <4 mo) of spoon -feeding to be associated with decreased risk of overweight at 42 y. Schack -Nielsen et al. (44) also found no significant associations between number of food items from the CFB groups at ages 3, 4, 5, or 6 mo and risk of overweight at 42 y. Zheng et al. (49) reported that introduction to fish liver oil <3 vs. at 4- 6 mo was significantly 37 associated with increased risk of overweight at 4- 5 y, but not obesity at 4- 5 y. There were no significant associations between introduction to other CFB examined in that study (e.g., egg yolk, liver paste, tofu) and risk of overweight or obesity at 4- 5 y of age (49). 38 Table 5.

All studies, except those noted as RCT or non -RCT, followed a prospective cohort design 2. The independent variable/exposure of interest included types and/or amounts of CFB, which encompassed dietary patterns during the complementary feeding period and timi ng of specific CFB; this section of studies examined various other CFB that did not fit into previously labeled sections such as milk and/or dairy products, vegetables, fruits, egg, and categories such as \"ready -made\" or \"animal source\" foods. 3. Outcomes w ere organized for practicality into columns: weight status, body composition, weight, length or height, and head circumferenc e. Results described in the respective columns are based on outcome similarity and in accordance with the analytical framework a s follows: Weight status included risk/incidence/prevalence/frequency of malnutrition, healthy weight, overweight, or obesity; Body comp osition included measures, indices, and proxies of overall adiposity such as lean mass, fat mass (FM), % body fat, weight -to-height ratios such as BMI, BMIZ, WLZ, central adiposity or waist circumference, and arm or thigh circumferences; Weight included weight -specific measures such as weight -for-age z -score (WAZ), Length or Height included length- specific measures such as len gth-for-age z -score (LAZ); Head circumference included head circumference randomized controlled circumference; WAZ, weight z -score; WLZ, weight for length z -score; Zn, zinc 47 Dietary patterns Eleve n articles examined distinct dietary patterns during the CF period, including one RCT (12) and 10 articles from observational studies (20, 23- 25, 28, 34, 41, 42, 46, 47) . Dietary patterns at different ages from the same cohort were analyzed in multiple articles as follows: Infant Feeding Practices Study (42, 47) and the Southampton Women's Survey (23, 41) (see Table 6). Seven articles from observational studies identified various associations between the dietary patterns examined and growth, size, body composition and/or overweight or obesity status outcomes (23, 28, 34, 41, 42, 46, 47) . Resu lts reported in these seven articles are summarized below briefly . Table 6 provides details regarding the specific dietary patterns that were compared and additional information can be found in Supplemental Table 1 . Baird et al . (33) found that adherence to the 'Infant guidelines' pattern at age 6 mo was associated with significantly greater conditional gains in weight and skinfold thickness from 6 -12 mo and greater absolute skinfold thickness at 12 mo of age. Infants who were i n the highest compared to lowest quartile for scores on the U.K. 'Infant guidelines' pattern at 6 mo gained ~0.12kg more weight and ~0.49mm more in skinfold thickness from 6- 12 mo of age. Greater adherence to the 'Adult foods' pattern at 6 mo was significa ntly associated with lower weight gain from 6- 12 mo of age but not with skinfold thickness (at age 12 mo or gain from 6- 12 mo). There were no significant associations between either dietary pattern at 6 mo and weight or length at 12 mo or change in length from 6 -12 mo of age. Robinson et al. (51) reported that greater adherence to the U.K. 'Infant guidelines' pattern at age 12 mo was significantly associated with increased lean mass and lean mass index, but not with BMI, FM, or FMI at 4 y of age. Rose et al. (52) used latent class analysis to assign infants based on frequency of intake to one of five dietary patterns described in Table 6. Outcomes were assessed based on maternal -report of height and weight. Rose et al. (52) reported that infants in the 'MXHED' group had the highest prevalence of overweight at 1 y of age compared to all other classes. The 'MXHED' and 'FFLV' groups had significantly higher WLZ at 1 y than other classes ('BFLV', 'BFFV', or 'FFFV'). Wen et al. (57) assigned adherence scores to each infant for four dietary patterns at age 6 mo, identified via principal component analysis. Outcomes were assessed based on reported weight and height. Wen et al. (57) found no significant association between adherence to the U.S. 'Infant guideline sol ids' pattern at 6 mo and change in BMIZ from 6 -12 mo. However, greater adherence to the other three patterns at 6 mo was associated with greater change in BMIZ from 6 -12 mo. Both the 'High dairy/regular cereal' and 'High sugar/fat/protein' patterns were as sociated with smaller increases in LAZ from age 6- 12 mo. Golley et al. (44) assigned each infant a CF utility index (CFUI) score at age 6 mo, which was derived and analyzed from dietary pattern scores as a continuous variable from 14 components such as B F duration, age of introduction to solids, textured foods, and minimizing ready -made infant foods. Higher CFUI scores reflected higher adherence to U.K. guidelines for CF. Golley et al. (44) reported that higher CFUI scores at 6 mo were not associated with BMI at 7 y of age but were (weakly) associated with smaller WC at 7 y. 48 Two a rticles (28, 46) f rom obs ervational st udies r eported similar r elationships bet ween dietary pat terns and wasting (defined according to arm -muscle- area, w hich was calculated from MUAC and triceps ski nfold thickness) and/ or malnutrition (defined as WAZ, LA Z, and/ or W LZ of l ess than 2 SD, r espectively underweight, s tunting, or wasting, according to Thai referenc es). Dagnelie and Staveren found that a 'Macrobiotic' diet compared to 'Om nivorous' diet at age 4-1 8 mo (see Table 6) was significantly asso ciated with higher w asting, lower we ight-for-length, l ower w eight velocity, lower l ength velocity, lower M UAC ve locity, lower ar m muscle area velocity, and lower H C velocity (37) . However, t here were no significant di fferences i n crown- rump length velocity, width a rea velocity (mm2/y). Tantrecheewathorn reported that 'Inadequate' compared to 'Adequate' diets (see Table 6) were significantly as sociated with increased relative r isk of malnutr ition, defined as either underweight, s tunted, or wasted ( 55). Four ar ticles r eport ed no significant ass ociations bet ween dietary pat terns ( observed, or der ived by anal yses) during the CF period and growth, size, an d body co mposition outcomes (1 2, 20, 24, 25). R esults sh owed no significant di fferences bet ween the respective dietary pat terns ex amined in each study and the following outcomes examined: ( mean or c hange in) weight, l ength, H C, or M UAC at 6- 12 mo of age (21) , overweight/obesity st atus at 45- 48mo (29) ; body co mposition, w eight, or l ength at 4- 6 mo (ref 33 ); or body c ompositi on at age 24 mo (34) . 49 Table 6.

Outcomes were organized for practicality into columns: weight status, body composition, weight, length or height, and head ci rcumfe rence. Results described in the respective columns are based on outcome similarity and in accordance with the analytical framework as follow s: Weight status included risk/incidence/prevalence/frequency of malnutrition, healthy weight, overweight, or obesit y; Body composition included measures, indices, and proxies of overall adiposity such as lean mass, fat mass (FM), % body fat, weight -to-height ratios such as BMI, BMIZ, WLZ, central adiposity or waist circumference, and arm or thigh circumferences; Weight included weight -specific measures such as weight -for-age z -score (WAZ), Length or Height 55 included length- specific measures such as length -for-age z -score (LAZ), linear velocity; Head circumference included head circumference.

There is insufficie nt evidence to determine a relationship between meat intake and prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. Despite the majority of evidence coming from well -designed RCTs, these studies were not necessarily designed to determine the effects of adequate or inadequate amounts of meat consumption on growth- related outcomes. For example, the objective of Yeung and Zlotkin (18) was to prevent iron depletion in cow's milk -fed infants by testing CFBs that are higher in iron content, and collected anthropometric measurements mainly to ensure that growt h was not impaired during the trial. Among the trials, there are several important methodological limitations such as short durations ~3 mo, variable length of follow -up, relatively small sample sizes, insufficiently described data, statistical analyses, and/or outcome assessment methods. Findings from one study in China may be less generalizable due to participants coming from a rural community with high rates of stunting (15). All of the RCTs reported outcomes prior to 18 mo of age and therefore do not provide information on growth, size, or body composition later in childhood. Five studies (two RCTs and three observational studies) examined the amount of meat given and BMI only, weight only, or weight and other outcomes. Neither of the trials assessed the impact of high loss to follow -up or provided sufficient detail to determi ne the reliability/validity of outcome assessment (2, 3) and did not adjust for baseline differences between groups (3) , or did not report results for all potential outcomes (2) . Observational studies pointed to positive relationships between meat intake and outcomes but varied in terms of when m eat intake was examined, how outcomes were assessed, and did not adjust analyses for potential key confounders (SES, maternal age, or gestational age). Cereal Limited evidence suggests that type or amount of cereal given does not favorably or unfavorably i nfluence growth, size, body composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity . Results from six studies (3 RCTs) provided little evidence of a strong relationship between the type or amount of cereal and the outcomes assessed. Studies vari ed considerably in the type or amount of cereal provided (e.g., wheat/soy vs. wheat/milk fortified weaning cereal; Fe- fortified vs. non- fortified cereal) and outcomes examined. Limitations include a lack of description regarding statistical methods, potent ial impact of unintended exposures due to other CFB consumed, indirectness, failure to adjust statistical analyses for multiple comparisons, and limited generalizability. CFB with different fats/ fatty acid composition Moderate evidence suggests that consumption of complementary foods with different fats and/or fatty acid composition does not favorably or unfavorably influence growth, size, or body composition although there is not enough evidence regarding over weight or obesity specifically. There was vari ation in the different CFB and/or fats/fatty acids 57 tested (4, 6, 10, 13) , with two studies examining egg- yolk as sources of DHA, one examining fish, and another examining a CFB meal with fatty -acids from different oil sources. None of the studies examined outcomes at ages older than 24 mo. Most of the art icles lacked sufficient description of outcome assessment methods and therefore, the validity/reliability of outcomes could not be determined. Two articles did not account for high loss to follow -up (6, 13) . One of the RCTs may not have been adequately powered to detect differences in growth (13) . SSBs. Limited evidence suggests that SSB consumption during the CF period is associated with increased risk of obesity in childhood, but is not associated with other measures of grow th, size, and body compos ition. Two studies examined the relationship between SSB consumption during the CF period and risk of obesity in childhood. One of those two studies demonstrated significant increased risk of obesity in childhood and was weighed more heavily than the other study due to its strength including sample size and adjustment for potential confounders. Three studies examined the relationship between SSB consumption during the CF period and other outcomes (BMI, BMI trajectory, BMIZ, and WC) in childhood, with all fi nding no significant associations with these other measures. The relationship between early introduction of SSBs in the CF period and later childhood overweight or obesity could reflect unmeasured confounding factors. A stronger conclusion could not be drawn due to an inadequate number of studies (all were observational), inconsistencies in how SSBs were examined (e.g., age of introduction of SSBs), and lack of information on quantities consumed. Juice drinks and 100% juice. Limited evidence suggested a si gnificant positive association between juice intake and infant weight -for-length and child BMI z -scores . However, there is not enough evidence to determine the relationship between juice intake and other outcomes (i.e., growth, size, and/or body composition). The evidence came from only a few observational studies, most of which examined juice intake without describing the type of fruit or % of fruit juice in the juice, although one study specified orange juice or other 100% fruit juice (45). Notably, there were a few positive and significant associations observed between juice intake in relatively large amounts (e.g., 8- 15 oz) or at young ages (e.g., at 9 mo) and WLZ, BMIZ, or WAZ. There was variation in types and age of outcomes assessed across studies, with most reporting weight relative to length outcomes (e.g., WLZ, BMI) at different ages. The reliability/validity of measures for outcome assessment could not be determined in several of these studies because weight and/or length was obtained from maternal report, unstandardized methods, or was not reported. Other CFB No conclusion could be made about the relationship between other CFB (vegetables, fruit, dairy products and/or cow's milk, cereal -based products, milk -cereal drink, and/or categories such as \"ready -made\" foods) and growth, size, body composition, and/or prevalence/incidence of overweight or obesity. This was primarily due to het erogeneity in study design and the types of other CFB examined (e.g., distinct CFB such as cow's milk, MCD, vegetables, fruit, tofu, biscuits/breads, and/or groupings such as dairy products, animal source foods, sweetened/confectionary foods, 'mixed' foods , and 58 'ready -made' foods). The majority of evidence was observational, although data were included from several RCTs and one non- RCT. There were also the following: limited generalizabili ty to the U.S. population due to CFB used or CF practices at the tim e of the study, inadequacy of statistical methods regarding adjustment for multiple comparisons, indirectness with which some studies examined the link between types or amounts of other CFB and outcomes, variation in outcome types and assessment methods, and inconsistency in which analyses were adjusted for potential confounders (e.g., SES, race and/or ethnicity, feeding practices, or birth size). Dietary patterns No conclusion could be made about the rel ationship between distinct dietary patterns during the CF period and growth, size, body composition, or prevalence/incidence of malnutrition, overweight or obesity (Table 8). The conflicting evidence precludes the ability to draw a conclusion due to heterogeneous analyses of dietary patterns. The studies were difficult to compare and contrast due to the wide variation in the specific dietary patterns compared, as well as the outcomes assessed. In several cases, the labelling of dietary patterns carried judgement (e.g., 'Inappropriate' or 'Inadequate'), which may or may not correspond to evidence- based infant feeding. Several articles examined the relationship between dietary patterns that align with CF guidelines and growth, size, and/or body composition out comes. Although some studies emphasized fruits, vegetables, and meats in a pattern labelled \"Infant guidelines', there were differences in other emphasized foods, such as baby cereal (56) or commercial baby food (50) , across other patterns. Several articles identified dietary patterns that do not clearly align with CF guidelines and varied widely in specific foods or food groups included (e.g., high frequency of french fries, sweet foods, fish/shellfish, nut foods, and eggs (47) compared to bread, snacks, crisps, breakfast cereals and low frequency of human milk and cooked/canned fruit (23)).These prospective studies are likely conf ounded by unmeasured factors that may differ between families that follow infant feeding guidelines vs. those who do not. For example, families that adhere to infant feeding guidelines may choose healthier diets and lifestyles (e.g. physical activity) later in the child's upbringing. The results from Dagnelie and van Staveren (37) and Tantracheewathorn (55) are less generalizable to the U.S. population due to the types of dietary patterns examined (i.e., 'Macrobiotic' vs. 'Omnivorous'; 'Inadequate' vs. 'Adequate'). Neither of these observational studies adjusted for several confounding factors nor provided sufficient detail regarding comparison diets (e.g., 'Omnivorous'; 'Inadequate'). The relationship between dietary patterns during the CF period and overw eight or obesity status was examined in two articles from observational studies, which varied in the specific dietary patterns assessed and reported inconsistent results. Limitations Across the entire body of evidence, there were concerns surrounding methodological limitations and internal validity. One methodological limitation across most of the 59 observational studies includes the potential for reverse causality. That is, the child may already be growing faster or slower when decisions regarding feeding frequency, types, or amounts of CFB are made. Another limitation includes the variability in controlling for confounding factors. While most studies did account for infant milk - feeding practices, the majority of observational studies (22 of 30) did not adjust for two or more key confounders (see Figure 1). Most of the RCTs enrolled infants who were EBF (4, 5, 11- 15, 17) or EFF (1, 9) to 4 mo of age or older. With few exceptions, the included studies were not designed to evaluate different amounts of CFB but rather varying types of CFB relative to outcomes. In addition, many studies were designed to test the influence of CFB in relation to outcom es other than those of interest in this SR. For example, several studies aimed to test the influence of Fe- fortified cereal on iron status, using anthropometric measures as secondary outcomes. In many cases, the amount of CFB provided would not be expected to affect growth and body composition over the duration in which it was tested. Several studies examined timing of specific types of CFB as opposed to more directly comparing different types and/or amounts of CFB in relation to growth outcomes (22, 26, 29, 30, 38, 43, 44, 49) . Most of the studies examined outcomes at multiple time points or assessed change over time to capture growth. However, a few trials (3, 6, 10) and many observational studies (20, 22, 25, 29, 31, 34, 41- 43, 47- 49) examined outcomes at only a single time point. Of those studies, all of the observational studies adjusted analyses for baseline or current anthropometric status (25, 29, 34, 47, 49) , or birth weight (20, 31, 41- 43, 49). Engelmann (3) reported differences between groups in baseline anthropometrics that were not accounted for in analyses. Both Libuda et al. (6) and Makrides et al. (10) lacked sufficient detail regarding outcome assessment, though Libuda et al. (6) reported no differences in birth w eight between groups at baseline. Another limitation is the limited reliability/validity of assessment methods for both outcome assessment and assessment of types and/or amounts of CFB. Several studies used weight/height that was reported weight/height, not measured, from various sources (31, 40, 42, 44, 47) , did not fully describe their methods for assessing all outcomes (10, 13, 17, 20, 24, 35, 49) , or used unstandardized methods (2, 37, 38) . Several authors of the RCTs noted limitations regarding insufficient sample size/power and/or did not assess the impact of high loss to follow -up (2, 3, 6, 13, 16- 18). Most of the observational studies had adequate sample sizes to investigate the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB and outcomes although 15 (of 30) did not account for missing data/high attrition rates. Adequacy of statistical methods in sev eral of the RCTs was insufficient due to a lack of detail describing data in analyses or figures (9, 17, 19, 27, 46) . Adequacy of statistical methods in several of the observational studies could not be determined due to insufficient description and/or lack of statistical correction for multiple comparisons (32, 33, 35, 44, 49) . In many of the RCTs, blinding of investigators could not be determined and participants were not blinded due to receipt of specific types and/or amounts of CFB. Blinding of outcome assessors could not be determined in the majority of the observational studies 60 Research recommendations In order to better understand the relationship between types and/or amounts of CFB and growth, size, body composition, and/or risk of overweight or obesity, future research should consider: Rigorous study designs that directly examine the effects of specific types and amounts of CFB such as fruits, vegetables, meat, cereal, oil sources of fat/fatty acids, and dairy products on m ultiple growth- related outcomes over longer duration of intervention and follow -up. Evidence examining foods that may be historically non- traditional complementary foods in settings such as the U.S. (e.g., legumes, nuts and seeds). Additional observational evidence regarding consumption of CFB that are not nutrient -dense (e.g., contain added sugars, refined starches, or solid fats) during the CF period, which may influence energy balance, growth, and development Sufficient breadth and depth of duration of follow -up to determine short - and long- term influences of CFB on growth, size, and body composition (i.e., multiple studies that examine the relationship between types and amounts of CFB consumed and outcomes shortly after the CF period as well as into childhood, adolescence, and adulthood). Consistency across research investigating dietary patterns during the CF period, with respect to labeling dietary patterns (avoiding judgements about \"adequacy\"), analytical methods used to derive and assign patterns, f oods and food groupings included; and documentation of human milk and/or formula intake. Additional adjustments in observational studies to the extent possible for confounding factors, including: parental education, socioeconomic status, child sex, maternal age, race/ethnicity, feeding practices including dietary intake/patterns between baseline and follow- up, birth size, gestational age, baseline growth status.

The results of an electronic database search were s creened independently by two NESR analysts by reviewing titles, abstracts, and full text articles to determine which articles met the criteria for inclusion. A manual search was done to ascertain articles not identified through the electronic database search. The systematic review on timing of introduction of CFB included 81 articles, and the systematic review on types and amounts of CFB consumed included 49 articles. The literature search was conducted for multiple systematic reviews that addressed complementary feedi ng and various health outcomes. 76 Excluded articles The table below lists the excluded articles with at least one reason for exclusion, but may not reflect all possible reasons.
