Live my life! Science is interesting, but I have other things to care about. What? Does it concern me, too? I am irritated about disagreeing experts and uncertain facts. Wow, that sounds scary! Oh my, the virus has reached my neighborhood! I have to take care of my family! I hear no more news about the pandemic, is it over yet?Live as healthy as possible! Get an idea of how exactly people do get infected! The WHO informs you on their website. Dierentiate between rumors, ocial information sources and populist messages. Gather information from several sources, including websites from WHO and ECDC. Draw your own conclusion! Even when the press spot- light has found something more interesting you could be in danger. Get information from reliable sources like the national health authority, the WHO, CDC, ECDC etc. Get vaccinated to help control the outbreak!No tested vaccine is available yet. Avoid spreading the virus! Stay home if you feel sick, wash your hands carefully! In some cases avoiding public spaces and public transportation can be useful! Check whether you belong to a risk or priority group for vaccination! Get vaccinated! You or somebody in your family got serious symp- toms? If so go see a doctor! But please be patient, the health sta is working long hours now!No overreacting because of fatal cases - stay calm & e.g. wash your hands! Listen to advice from health authorities (e.g. WHO) or ask your doctor!ME SIZE SHOWS AMOUNT OF INFECTIONS SIZE SHOWS AMOUNT OF DEATHS PRESSTHIS POSTER 1.
