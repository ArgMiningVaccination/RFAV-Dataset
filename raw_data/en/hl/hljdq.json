Multicultural Calendar April is \"Celebrate Diversity Month \" Celebrating Diversity Hello fellow NSU MD students, staff and faculty. This month is an awesome occasion to recognize and honor the diversity surrounding us all , by celebrating our difference s and similarities. 'Celebrate Diversity Month' is about opening dialogues that foster an appreciation of the differences that distinguish us, as well as the similarities that unite us. We may look different, speak differently and practice different custom s, but we all valuably contribute in our own unique way to excellence in medical education. Our successes are attained through the contributions made possible by the diversity of our stude nts, faculty and staff. NSU MD believes that an environment of incl usiveness, equity , equality , acceptance, and respect for differences in the community , is essential for ex cellence in the fulfillment of our mission. This month , as the current pandemic piles on workload and precludes an in - person event, we draw our facult y's attention to the diversity webinar series made available by the American Association of Medical Colleges . We also attach a multicultural calendar and excerpts from our students. Although we acknowledge the stress of current conditions, w e encourage all st aff, faculty and students to complete a brief survey to sugge st strategies that can make our academic environment more diverse and inclusive. Faculty are also invited to participate as mentors in a virtual pipeline program. As you go through this month , espec ially with the challenges and adjustments we are currenl ty making in the COVID -19 pandemic, please take time to celebrate the diversity in your life, workplace and community, and appreciate the strengt h it brings us all. We invite you to take advantage of the AAMC Diversity 3.0 Learning Series @ https://www.aamc.org/what -we-do/mission -areas/diversity - inclusion/learning and view the following training webinar s in addition to other educational activities: Exploring Unconscious Bias in Academic Medicine The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies LGBT, Gender Nonconforming, and DSD Health Engaging Diverse Med ical Students and Residents To Pursue Academic Medicine Careers Inclusion What makes me unique : I'm always looking for a random topic to learn about, from ant wars to Dyson spheres. My Definition of Diversity : The thing about being unique is that when you look in the mirror, the person looking back at you is unlike any other. Diversity to me is a collection of unique people bringing their perspectives and ideas together. Aaiz Hussain NSU MD Class of 202 3 Volume 1, Issue 1 PAGE 2 DIVERSIT Y NEWSLETTER We are currently strateg izing to host our first virtual pipeline mentorship program for high school students f rom diverse backgrounds in our local communities. The program aims to encourage i nterest in careers in medicine . Mentees will be initially assign ed to faculty mentors over the course of three months and will receive guidance and counsel on how to navigate the course to medical school admissions. We expect to engage students from all ba ckgrounds with emphasis on underrepresented in medicine populati ons. Planned activities will span the months of M ay-July. Mentorship activities will require an average of 2-3 hou rs per month. All NSU MD faculty are invited to participate as mento rs. \"A small amount of time can make a large amount of difference\" . For additional information please contact Miss Jennifer Vaden -Rose @ jvaden@nova.edu . The NSU MD Diversity Committee r eports to the NSU MD Faculty Council twic e a year on our diversity and inclusion strategies, activities and results. We welcome suggestions and we rely on the active participation from our students, staff and faculty to bring our vision to reality. In December 2018, NSU MD and the Shepard Broad C ollege of Law collaborated to host 'Make An Impact With Law And Medicine Day . The program was designed to encourag e students to consider a career in medicine or law as a path to address health disparities , and to address legal and medical hurdles through i nterdisciplinary collaboration. The high school students came from four S outh Florida high schools . We will continue with such collaborations as we continue to build our pipeline initiatives. Our Pipe line Activities What makes me unique: I organized a weekly \"lunch club\" during my f irst semester at NSU MD for everyone to get to connect with each othe r and with South Florida's culturally diverse food. To me, diversity is being able to celebrate, exper ience, and share the variety of flavors that life has to offer. It would be boring t o ha ve to same meal over and over again.

Highlights from our pipeline events 5. Faculty development 6. Student voices Deconstructing Equity Hello fellow NSU MD students, staff and faculty. It has been an eventful past few months. The word equity has emerged as a trending topic in many forums especially those highlighting racial inequities. In the coming months , achieving racial equity in the workplace will be one of the most important issues that higher education institutions will address. When race no longer determines one's socioeconomic outcomes, then we have achieved racial equity. As a medical school we al so consistently focus on the indicators of equity in higher education with the goal of transforming our organizational framework to fit all our people. This means that we are committed to ensuring that every student has what he/she needs to be successful through the intentional design of the medical school experience. We have support systems in place to ensure that every student has an equal chance for success. Implementing these support systems requires a clear understanding of the unique challenges fa ced by individual students in order to help them overcome any barriers. Equity is anchored in the tenet of fairness and NSU MD has adopt ed equity policies that improve college affordability for low -income students, students of color, and other vulnerabl e populations . We are investing in innovation and evidence- based practices and policies to support completion , and most importantly we ensure that the safety and civil rights of our students are protected. Volume 1, Issue 2 The racially charged events that have captured our nation brings to bear the need for uncomfortable conversations around race . It is good to have uncomfortable conversations , because we gain understanding about the issues that affect us. Dialogue around racial realities that minorities are facing have provided an opportunity to share emotions and experiences, and a forum for other ethnic groups to develop authentic awareness. Racial dialo gue also provides an opportunity to tackle institutional racism . Institutional racism refers to discriminatory treatment, unfair policies and inequitable opportunities and impacts, based on race, produced and perpetuated by institutions . This is typically embedded in a historical structure where racial minorities chronically experience pervasive negative differences. It is important that organizations take an active approach to dismantl e racism by empowering the development of diverse formal and informal leadership at all levels and developing a strategic plan that increases accountability and demonstrates transparency. \"If tolerance, respect and equity permeate family life, they will translate into values that shape societies, nations and the world.\" - Kofi Annan \"Equality is the soul of liberty; there is, in fact, no liberty without it. \" - Frances Wright PAGE 2 DIVERSITY NEWSLETTER I'm doing whatever I can to make changes here that make it a better place for everyone, and I ask that you do the same. Qaas Shoukat NSU MD Class of 202 3 Thoughts from Qaas on Racial Equity Racial equity matters. The recent murders of innocent black women and men are a testament to the racial inequity that many of us still face. It is painful and difficult to confront such realities, but on an individual level, we all must do our own part by not only acknowledging and working to eliminate our own prejudices and biases, but to assist others to do the same. While we must also fight for meaningful institutional change, our journey towards implementing and maintaining racial equity begins in our own communities. NSU MD is a community that we are all a part of - as a cutting -edge institution that prides itself on being innovative, NSU MD hails diversity as one of its Seven Core Values. It is a value that I believe every student, faculty and staff member should not only embrace, but actively promote. I am whole -heartedly optimistic that real change will come and that we may be witness ing history before us; we should use this occasion to ensure that we start programs here that bridge the racial inequities present in society . It is time that we all ask ourselves what we can do to bridge the racial equity gap . Heidi Kiziah NSU MD Class of 2022 An environment built on the foundation of equity using building blocks such as mentoring minority youths and empowering underrepresented voices, is a diverse one. An environment that identifies problems within itself an d fixes them through improving cultural competencies in medical students and bettering the quality of healthcare offered to the LGBTQ+ community and other populations facing health disparities is an inclusive one. Diversity is going out of our way to ensur e a community that is not only inclusive in its make up, but equitable in its opportuni ties. I am happy to share that Seema Belani and I will be spearheading the launch of an open dialogue book club in the coming weeks, to facilitate dialogue in the NSU MD community around race, racism and other issues that relate to health disparities. Dear NSU MD, in the midst of a global coronavirus pandemic we have united to bring scientific, clinical and community resources to bear. Let us recognize eight of our NSU -MD students- Shivani Kaushal , Patete , Samuel Raine, Jason Shao and Sydney Stillman who crowd sourced over $1 300.00 in two days to procure and assemble over 3,100 face shields. The shields were donated to the Broward County Medical Association, Holy Cross Hospital , Orlando Health, Nemours Hospital Orlando, and some Palm Beach area nursing homes. Continue the great work!! PAGE 3 DIVERSITY NEWSLETTER Diversity Responsive Medical Education Achieving greater diversity and inclusion in academic medicine are not only important in equalization, but also to prepare medical students who are diverse in thoughts and cultural competencies. A diversified physician workforce will more effectively meet the needs of an increasingly diverse patient population, which is crucial to ultimately eliminating health disparities within health care. Here in Florida , African Am ericans make up roughly 17% of the general population, yet our physician workforce diversity is lagging with only 5.5% of medical doctors being African American. Similarly , Hispanics constitute 26% of the general population, but only 17% of medical doctors in the state are Hispanic. Sexual minority physicians are also needed to serve the unique needs of the growing LGBTQ community. The recent southern LGBTQ health survey highlighted the dire need for better healthcare and health outcomes for this population , and NSU MD has initiated several funded initiatives to increase the LGBTQ cultural compet encies of our students. Read the full report of Southern LGBTQ health survey here : https://southernequality.org/wpcontent/uploads/2019/11/SouthernLGBTQH ealthSurvey -ExecutiveSummary.pdf NSU MD is prioritizing diver sity in every aspect of our institutional culture as shown in figure 1 below , to ensure that we recruit and retain a diverse student, staff and faculty pool. Most recently w e developed an elective course entitled the ' Fundamentals of diversity and inclusion in medicine ' for our M3 class. Our goal is to create and maintain a culture of diversity and inclus ion. Integral to the success of our diversity initiatives are our pipeline programs . Highlights from our pipeline programs are below!!!! Figure 1 . The interface of diversity and inclusion within medical education Medical school is fast - there is only enough time in the classroom to plant the seed for LGBTQ healthcare . To best support the 4.5% of the US population identifying as LGBTQ, future physicians need to foster the growth of that seed on our own. The opportunities to do so are endless and flexible regarding levels of engagement: sit down and stream \"When We Rise\", lead a LGBTQ health research project, partner with local LGBTQ organizations to develop health screening events, join a weekend LGBTQ running group, volunteer for the Trevor Project, go to a Pride Festival. Any opportunity allows us to sprout into more c aring, understanding physicians in improving health outcomes for the LGBTQ community . I am happy to be engaged in several research initiatives involving NSU MD faculty and the local LGBTQ community in th is COVID -19 era. My hope is to continue to engage with our local community to improve the mental health outcomes of our local elderly LGBTQ population.

This collaboration between NSU MD and the Blanche Ely H igh School Medical Magnet Program engages students who are interested in careers in medicine through various mentorship activities . The overall goal of the program is to provide students from backgrounds underrepresented in medicine with an opportunity to develop skills that will increase their competitiveness for admission to schools of medicine. It was a great kick off . In this initial meeting students were paired with mentors and discussed: 1. Different facets of the medical profession 2. Strategies and skills to navigate the application process to medical school 3. Tips to build their portfolio s Through this program, w e hope to create a pipeline of interested students into the medical field by developing meaningful mentoring relationships with the youth in our communities. Our faculty mentors Dr. Stephen Ely, Dr. Miriam Zylberglait Lisigurski, Dr. Nicholas Lutfi, Dr. John Ogunlade (keynote speaker) and Dr. Vijay Rajput as well as our student mentors Muhammad Awan , Mitchell Bourne, Samantha Marazita, Jackie Nguyen, and Eric Young, all did an excellent job!!! The STEM Ready Program is a program directed by the U rban League of Broward County (UBLC). NSU MD recently partnered with the UBLC to mentor their STEM ready Middle School Students at their end-of- the-school -year event last month. Students from the Silver Lakes M iddle School engaged in dialogue with M3 student Eric Young and NSU MD faculty members Dr. Kate Carnevale, Dr. Joshua Costin, Dr. Arkene Levy, Dr. Samiksha Prasad & Dr. Michelle Zhao . Our faculty provide d insights into different career trajectories in STEM, and tips on how to be perseverant , especially in the fac e of new adversities such as the COVID -19 pandemic. It was indeed heartening to interact with these motivated young minds, and we hope to continue to foster these mentoring relationships.

NSU MD virtual Dash for Diversity 5. Logo competition 6. Student spotlight 7. Faculty Development Exploring our Biases Volume 1, Issue 3 The following approaches are proposed by the Kirwan Institute as evidence - based bias mitigation strategies: fostering and increasing motivation toward unrestricted goals, perspective taking and empathy building, mindfulness, and building new relations,1,2. These strategies can be employed at the i ndividual and Institutional level . In her recent seminar to NSU MD, Dr. Julie Servoss group ed these strategies more broadly into three categories: 1. Deliberative processing and self -monitoring - where for example Implicit association tests (IAT s) can be used by an individual to measure or identify certain attitudes and beliefs . 2. Individuating - where a conscious effort is made to see diverse others as individuals rather than as members of groups. 3. Perspective taking - where a conscious attempt is made to envision another person's viewpoint. CLICK HERE for Dr. Servoss' s full presentation We are often unaware of our implicit biases; however, tracking data is a great way to start identifying trends and to establish that bias. This is crucial for informing how we should intervene. One of the most important predictors of unconscious bias are friends, family , and people we surround ourselves with. Therefore, it is important to also try to have meaningful intergroup contact . 1. http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/implicit- bias-traini ng/ 2. https://u.osu.edu/breakingbias/tools -for-mitigating -bias/ \"To know the true reality of yourself, you must be aware not only of your conscious thoughts , but also of your unconscious prejudices, bias and habits \" - Author Unknown \"Knowing that one may be subject to bias is one thing; being able t o correct it is another\" - Jon Elster Literature offers several definitions of bias. When viewed from a very simple perspective , a bias can be defined as an inclination or propensity toward or against an individual or a particular thing. There are two types of biases . The first is explicit or conscious bias where an individual 's feelings and attitudes and related behaviors are conducted with obvious intent and is easily identifiable. The second is Implicit or unconscious bias where our unconscious associations cause us to act in a way that unfairly has a negative impact on another person or group. Because the origins and motivations of our actions are unknown to ourselves, we may not even realize that our actions, or in some cases our inactions, may cause harm to others . An important question for us to ponder in the context of medical education is how and to what extent the presence of implicit bias es impacts our interactions within the academic and clinical setting . Implicit bias es can impact peer to peer interactions at the student, faculty, and staff level. Such interactio ns can negatively interfere with learning, open communication, clinical assessment, decision -making and ultimately educational, professional, health, and healthcare outcomes. So how might we take our first steps in exploring our implicit biases ? It begins firstly with us recognizing and acknowledging that implicit bias es do exists , and secondly expanding our knowledge and mindfully engaging in strategies to mitigate these biases. Several of these bias mitigating strategies are discussed below. PAGE 2 DIVERSITY NEWSLETTER NSU MD Bias Curriculum NSU aims to maintain an institutional culture where biases do not compromise diversity and inclusion efforts in admissions, curriculum development, counseling, hiring, promotions, faculty advising and other activities. Our bias curriculum consists of activities to he lp us meet these goals. During the month o f September, we hosted several events: Dr Julie Servoss delivered an interactive seminar on unconscious bias and microaggressions We provided LGBTQ proficiency training for our faculty and staff We delivered a case- based implicit bias session to the combined M1/M2 class The student led Open Dialogue Book club hosted its second meeting, which focused on microaggressions We will continue to roll -out activities throughout the academic year Diversity Logo Competition Ami Shaddipur NSU MD Class of 202 3 \"If we want to be equitable physicians and citizens, we must tackle our unconscious biases. At first glance, unconscious bias may seem easily overcome. However, once we have to make snap judgments under pressure while multitasking, exhausted, or afraid- it's human instinct to stop screening. We've seen this time and time again with the racially charged snap judgments responsible for the murders of black women and men. We see it in healthcare as well, where black people are less likely to be administered pain medications, evidence -based care, or surgical procedures that are clearly indicated. It's our responsibility to address these biases before it comes time for those quick judgments - during our training as physicians. NSU MD is well on its way to doing so by increasing representation and voices of underrepresented minorities in our latest MS1 class. Two of our MS2s, Heidi and Seema, created an amazing open dialogue book club to explore health disparities and racism . I'm happy that NSU MD is increasing awar eness of implicit bias; we will carry those lessons in our lives and our practice of medicine \" In August, the NSU MD Diversity Committee in collaboration with the Office of Admissions and Student Affairs hosted a logo competition where NSU MD students created an original design for the staging of our first annual Virtual Dash for Diversity 5K. The goal of the logo was a representation of our college's commitment to promoting and maintaining a culture of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in Medicine. The winning design by Ami Shiddapur (M2) and runner up Jacob Oster (M3) , were selected by members of the Diversity Com mittee and received a $100 and $50 gift card, respectively. Winning logo by Ami: Ami's logo description: A school of sharks, despite the diversity in characteristics and color, are \"dashing\" towards a common goal.

The sun in the background is a representation of the NSU sun logo with all colors utilized in alignment with official NSU colors. Runner up logo by Jacob: Jacob's logo description: My image is a circular navy blue logo with the fists of a diverse group of people in solidarity with each other. All of the fists used are the hands of actual NSU MD students or significant others. PAGE 3 DIVERSITY NEWSLETTER Jacob Oster NSU MD Class of 2022 \"I think that unconscious bias is at the root of many problems we face here in the US and especially in medicine. It can be difficult for people to grasp that their impact matters more than their intentions, and so they are often willing to write off their o wn biased decisions as being well -intentioned, even if they caused actual harm. The solution is for people to recognize that these biases exist and make an effort to overcome them, but the trouble lies in convincing people of their impact \" NSU MD V irtual 5K DASH for Diversity NSU MD will host its inaugural Virtual Dash for Diversity 5K from November 24th-30th 2020. Participants will come together virtually to raise funds in support of our pipeline programs with community middle and high schools.

Faculty Development Mentorship in Academic Medicine Volume 1, Issue 4 The word \"mentoring\" originates from the ancient Greek poem \"Odyssey\" by Homer , where Mentor is the name of the teacher who Odysseus trusted more than anyone to watch and teach his son. Indeed, mentorship in its ideal form describes a selfless relationship guided by a more experienced person where an exchange of wisdom leads to the growth and development of a mentee. In academic medicine, a culture of mentorship is a powerful tool that help s to generate a diverse body of leaders with diverse thoughts and skills. Mentorship plays a crucial role in the training and career development of medical students, residents, and faculty. Several studies have clearly shown that mentorship positively impacts the mentee, the mentor, and the ac ademic institution they belong to. Through mentoring by more experienced physicians, mentees gain valuable clinical skills, high standards of professionalism and ethical behavior, increased research productivity, and an overall increase in career satisfac tion. Mentor s gains a renewed sense of purpose in contributing to the development of the next generation of physicians . A culture of mentorship consisting of a diverse body of leaders is not only important to achieve vertical transmission of knowledge to accelerate learning and invigorate the medical workforce, but also to increase the number of underrepresented in medicine (URM) candidates that are recruited and retained in medical schools. For example, r oughly 6% of medical students in the United States are African American (AA) , while 12% of the general population is AA.This highlights that there is a deficit in the number of AA s in the physician workforce . Mentorship of AA students is therefore crucial to bridge this gap. Finally, mentorship benefits medical schools and teaching hospitals by resulting in greater faculty retention and productivity . Four key steps in mentoring: 1. Building the relationship 2. Setting clear expectations 3. Monitoring results 4. Providing feedback Breaking Barriers for URM s in Medicine The AAMC defines URM status applicants as \"those racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in the medical profession relative to their numbers in the general population.\" These are: African Americans and/or Black Hispanic/Latino Native American Pacific Islander Mainland Puerto Rican Despite increasing efforts to create a more a diverse physician workforce in the United States , Black, Hispanic, and American Indian students especially remain significantly underrepresented in medical schools . Multiple factors contribute to this including the cost of education , lack of academic preparation , admissions requirements, lack of mentors hip, bias , limited exposure to health careers and poor advising. At NSU MD we ha ve employed focused strategies to reduce barriers to URM matriculation and retention. T hese include peer to peer mentorship of incoming classes, holistic admissions practices, tailored academic support to enable students to maximize their potential, interprofessional activities with other health professions students, financial support mechanisms for URM candidates , and the implementation of pipeline programs such as Journey into M edicine to engage URM students at the high school level and equip them with tools and skills to help them strengthen their chances of being accepted into medical schools. Most importantly , we are intentional about building and maintaining a culture of inclusion in our college. PAGE 2 DIVERSITY NEWSLETTER Mentoring for Inclusion in Resear ch It has been widely reported that involvement of undergraduate students in research activities is beneficial to their overall educational growth and development . Research experience is also viewed as a strength by medical school admissions committees as it helps to build skills in scientific reasoning and thinking which are critical in healthcare decision -making and evidence- based medicine . Because such research activities depend on the mutual commitment of students and mentors, successful outcomes require the fostering of positive attitudes among diverse medical students towards scientific research. It is also critical to recognize that although URM candidates would stand to benefit most from the dedicated encouragement of research mentors , more limitations often exist for URM students to pursue research when compared to their non -URM counterparts . Therefore, it is important that faculty within medical schools intentionally encourage the participation of URM students in research. So how can we aid in the process? A good first step is to reach out and volunteer to mentor a student. Secondly , when seeking funding for research , consider applying for diversity supplements to support research by minority students. Finally , we should also aim to d esign research projects to facilitate long -term involvement of students while being mindful of other a spects of their curriculum , and to provide socioemotional and culturally relevant mentoring along with research -specific mentoring to your mentees. With the right combination of ambition, skill, dedication, and intellect, success is inevitable. Right? I'd be willing to bet that some sort of variant of this 'formula' has been repeated throughout our lives. While this thinking is undoubtedly important, the recognition of its shortcomings is equally significant. Experience, mentorship, and contacts are highly influential variables that, when present, illuminate a vastly different path. These silent variables are oftentimes overlooked, but their impact cannot be overstated, especially in a competitive field such as ours. Students who lack these influential assets face an added obstacle, as they must bli ndly navigate the fast - paced and cutthroat path to medical school. Of course, this is not to say that those who did have such advantages experienced an easy journey, as everyone faces their own unique challenges. This occurrence underscores the importance of mentorship for minority students who oftentimes are children of immigrants, or immigrants themselves, who do not have connections to physicians or mentors who may help them throughout their journey.The clubs that actively help guide younger students and fill the role of a mentor are contributing to the future of medicine. I'm excited to see current clubs, such as Shark Pals, and new clubs, such as LMSA, continue to expand this mission and increase mentorship for minority students to help bring about a di verse and representative group of future physicians. Jose R. Garcia, NSU MD Class of 2024 Mentor ship for URM Faculty Academic medical centers with a robust mentorship culture experience higher rates of faculty productivity , promotion and retention. As a new innovative medical college our focus on a culture of mentorship is essential to not only enhanc e the experience of our students but also our faculty. It is well e stablished that faculty who enjoy a healthy mentoring relationship are more productive, confident, and successful than those who do not have such guidance and support from a senior colleague. Studies show that URM faculty either do not understand the importance of finding a mentor or have difficulty doing so , and this l ack of mentorship can lead to unfulfilled goals , job dissatisfaction , disparit ies in academic promotions , and high attrition rates . According to a 201 7 report from Kaplan et al , URM faculty had fewer publications and were less likely to be promoted and retained in academic careers.1 A paucity of URM in positions of leadership at American academic health centers perpetuates the broader healthcare disparities minorities experience in access and treatment. Academic health centers are therefore encouraged to foster URM mentor/mentee relationships and programs. These p rograms must be comprehensive and be able to demonstrate a measurable decr ease in URM faculty representation disparities. Mentorship should begin at the department level , especially for new faculty , and should be integrated into the strategic plan of the institution to ensure that URM faculty have adequate resources and opportun ities to develop professionally. 1.
