Many health concerns and conditions are complex in symptomatology yet connected to one or more common root causes. Functional Medicine is an approach to patient care that focuses on biological systems and their complex interactions to address these root causes and their associated symptoms. Unlike conventional medicine that tends to just treat symptoms and body systems individually, Functional Medicine recognizes how symptoms and systems are interacting and interconnected. This approach allows for more personalized treatment options that look at the patient as a whole rather than individual parts. Functional Medicine can be life changing for those who have complex conditions, multiple potential causes for a condition, or multiple conditions caused by one underlying factor. Because we believe that everything in the body is connected to everything else in the body, we treat the entire body as a connected system, unlike conventional medicine which focuses on individual systems. Rather than simply writing prescriptions for each symptom, Functional Medicine prefers holistic, natural and nutritional treatments over medications when possible. Family history, lifestyle, diet, life stressors, and biochemical results are all considered to form a personalized treatment plan. Functional medicine always seeks to meet a person where they are to create a customized course of treatment that is both accessible and effective. In addition, the treatment options offered by conventional medicine may not reverse the root cause or even completely remove the symptoms; Functional Medicine can often reverse the cause over time while also treating the symptoms. \"Functional Medicine: Fixing your biochemistry from the ground up.\" Conditions We Treat: Complex Chronic Medical Conditions Thyroid Disease Adrenal Fatigue Menopause Andropause Metabolic Syndrome Insulin Resistance Diabetes High Cholesterol Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) PMS Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Irritable Bowel IBS/SIBO Depression Aesthetic Services Rejuvenate and renew.

It prioritizes eating nutrient dense whole foods and improving your relationship with food. While \"on the plate\" nutrition will be the primary focus of consultations, our PA will also encourage you to deeply examine how you show up for yourself every day. This integrative approach is vital because if you are undernourished \"off the plate\" then you likely won't reap the full benefits of a clean diet. Topics discussed may include phytonutrients, macronutrient distribution, gut/brain connection, gut microbiome, mindful eating, proper digestion, body shame, yo-yo dieting, body awareness, physical, emotional, and mental health, sleep, movement, spirituality, creativity, joy, relationships, home environment, and much, much more. We will help you create an individualized healthy, balanced lifestyle that will decrease your systemic inflammation, help you feel more comfortable around food, and help you break free from the restrict-binge-guilt-restrict cycle.

Recovering from the flu? Traveling soon? Had a rough night in the town and feeling dehydrated? Having a migraine? Overall, would you like a little pick-me-up? IV Hydration Infusions may be your answer! IV Hydration provides your body with immediately bioavailable vitamins and minerals needed to boost your immune system and help promote better overall health and wellness.

Well Woman Exams Our PA-C Kacie can perform your routine well woman pelvic exam and PAP smear right here at IHS. Routine PAP smears are important as they screen for cervical cancer. Our cash pay rate is $125 for the entire 30 minute visit (not including the lab sample). This DOES NOT replace the need for your primary care provider or annual wellness exam and is not intended to be used for female gynecological problems (yeast infections, bacterial vaginosis, etc.), but DOES provide an alternative service should you prefer your routine well woman exams be performed here at IHS. The lab samples themselves will be sent to LabCorp, which can be billed to insurance if desired. "}
