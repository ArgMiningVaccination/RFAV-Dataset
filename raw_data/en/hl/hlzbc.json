A CAR is a genetically-engineered receptor made so that immune cells (T cells) can attack cancer cells by recognizing and responding to the CD19/CD22 proteins. These proteins are commonly found on diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine phosphate, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. NKTR-255 is an investigational IL-15 receptor agonist designed to boost the immune system's natural ability to fight cancer. Giving CD19/CD22-CAR T cells and chemotherapy in combination with NKTR-255 may work better in treating patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma or B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Official Title Phase 1 Dose Escalation Study of CD19/CD22 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells With or Without NKTR-255 in Adults With Recurrent or Refractory B Cell Malignancies Eligibility Criteria - 1. History of other malignancy, unless disease free for at least 3 years. At the discretion of the Principal Investigator, subjects in remission for 1-2 years prior to enrollment may be deemed eligible after considering the nature of other malignancy, likelihood of recurrence during one year following CAR therapy, and impact of prior treatment on risk of CD19/CD22-CAR T cells. Subjects in remission <1 year are not eligible. - Exception: Nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in situ (e.g. cervix, bladder, breast) is eligible. - Hormonal therapy in subjects in remission >1 year will be allowed. 2. Presence of fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is uncontrolled. Simple UTI and uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis are permitted if responding to active treatment. 3. Known history of infection with any of the following: - HIV - Hepatitis B (HBsAg positive) - Hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV positive) A history of hepatitis B or hepatitis C is permitted if the viral load is undetectable per quantitative PCR and/or nucleic acid testing. 4. Presence of a seizure disorder, cerebrovascular ischemia/hemorrhage, dementia, cerebellar disease, or any autoimmune disease with CNS involvement that in the judgment of the investigator may impair the ability to evaluate neurotoxicity. 5. History of myocardial infarction, cardiac angioplasty or stenting, unstable angina, or other clinically significant cardiac disease within 12 months of enrollment 6. Any medical condition that in the judgement of the investigator is likely to interfere with assessment of safety or efficacy of study treatment 7. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in this study 8. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding 9. In the investigator's judgment, the subject is unlikely to complete all protocol-required study visits or procedures, including follow-up visits, or comply with the study requirements for participation. 10. Previous treatment with interleukin-2 or interleukin-15. 11. Confirmed diagnosis of relapsed/refractory biphenotypic BT cell ALL 12. Primary immunodeficiency or history of autoimmune disease (e.g. Crohns, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus) requiring systemic immunosuppression/systemic disease modifying Contact us to find out if this trial is right for you.
