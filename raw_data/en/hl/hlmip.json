This is why naturopathic doctors recommend cleanses to rid the body of toxins. But at a conference I recently attended, I was impressed to see the mounting scientific evidence proving that toxins are a primary driver for countless health problems. The good news is that there are steps we can take to protect ourselves and the environment. Our toxic environment Unfortunately, the reality of the world today is that we are ALL exposed to a plethora of toxins. There have been more than 80,000 new toxic chemicals released into our environment in the past 60 years, very few of which have been tested for safety. According to a 2004 study spearheaded by the Environmental Working Group, 287 toxic chemicals were found in the umbilical cord blood of newborn babies in the USA, even though some of these toxins were banned in the '70s. From this study came the statement: \"Of the 287 chemicals we detected in umbilical cord blood, we know that 180 cause cancer in humans or animals, 217 are toxic to the brain and nervous system, and 208 cause birth defects or abnormal development in animal tests.\" (Source: [http://www.ewg.org/research/body-burden-pollution-newborns](http://www.ewg.org/research/body-burden-pollution-newborns)) If you think living in the \"clean north\" saves you from toxins, think again. The Arctic is particularly vulnerable to global sources of pollution. Volatile contaminants travel north from warmer climates and become incorporated into our colder ecosystem. The major air currents flowing to the Yukon come from southeast Asia, so pollution from China ends up here, in our air, land, water and wildlife. How toxins harm us Toxins can damage DNA, cell membranes, organs and enzymes, all of which are critical for countless bodily functions, cognitive and nervous system function, energy production, and the production of molecules we need to survive. They can also displace structural minerals, resulting in weaker bones. Toxins can also modify gene expression, interfere with hormones and impair the body's ability to detoxify, which further compounds their negative consequences. Here are some examples of diseases driven by toxins. Smoking cigarettes doubles the risk of getting lung cancer; 23% of the population has enough arsenic in their bodies to double the risk of gout; 25% of the population has enough DDT to double the risk of ADHD; 55% of the population has enough phthalates to double the risk of diabetes; 60% of the population has enough PCBs to double the risk of breast cancer; and POPs (persistent organic pollutants) can cause a 12-fold increase in the risk for developing diabetes. (Source for the above 2 paragraphs: Pizzorno, Joseph. The Toxin Solution. New York: Harper One, 2017.) Here's a link to a recent study linking plastics to disease: [http://ihpmagazine.com/are-phthalates-causing-chronic-disease-in-your-male-patients/](http://ihpmagazine.com/are-phthalates-causing-chronic-disease-in-your-male-patients/) Signs and symptoms of toxin overload can be many. The major indicators are: chemical sensitivities (these people are \"the canaries in the coal mine\"), environmental or food allergies, brain fog, auto-immune disorders, cancer, neurological illnesses like Parkinson's, anxiety and depression. Other signs that can be linked with toxicity are headaches, fatigue, infertility, hormonal disruption, skin rashes, insomnia, weight gain, infertility, and sinus/lung irritation. Sources It's difficult to avoid toxins that come from industrial pollution, but thankfully we only absorb about 5% of toxins through air. Below is a list of sources over which you can have control. 1) Food and water: 80% of toxins we absorb come into us through food and water. Food and water can contain neurotoxic pesticides and herbicides, antibiotics, heavy metals, fertilizers, hormones, food colouring, food additives and preservatives, artificial sweeteners, and GMOs. The packaging of food (plastic, popcorn bags, pizza boxes) can also emit toxins and the way we cook can create harmful chemicals as well. 2) Personal Care Products: Many toxins are found in shampoo, skin cream, cosmetics, perfumes, soaps, toothpaste, etc. 3) Household items & yard chemicals: Building materials, furniture, carpets, clothing, paint, cleaning supplies, fertilizers and weed/insect control products can all contain harmful chemicals. Our bodies have the natural ability to detoxify themselves, but we aren't able to handle the level of toxins we are now exposed to. Many of us also have genetic defects that reduce our body's ability to eliminate toxins. I know it can feel quite overwhelming when you read these facts. But the good news is there are many ways you can decrease the amount of toxins you take in, and at the same time, reduce the amount that are released into the environment. Practical tips to decrease toxin exposure I am aware that some of the recommendations below are expensive and/or not always possible. I offer you this information to help you be more informed and give you some ideas to decrease your exposure. Doing a little bit is better than doing nothing. FOOD - Eat organically grown, unprocessed, non-GMO food. This will help you avoid consuming the pesticides, herbicides, and chemicals that come in the form of additives and preservatives. Especially avoid the \"Dirty Dozen\" [https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty_dozen_list.php](https://www.ewg.org/foodnews/dirty_dozen_list.php) - Avoid buying canned foods, even if organic, as they are lined with plastic containing BPA. *** Just two servings of canned foods per week doubles the risk of diabetes! - Store your food in containers made of glass, stainless steel or ceramic only. - Avoid buying food packaged in plastic. - Grow some of your own food, using only natural fertilizers. - Avoid Teflon, non-stick and aluminum cookware. Use stainless steel, cast iron or ceramic. - Do not eat large pike, lake trout, or farmed fish. - Avoid cooking with high heats as it can produce carcinogenic chemicals; it's better to steam, bake, stir-fry with water, or stew your food. - Limit alcohol consumption. - Limit sugar consumption; sugar impedes the liver's ability to clear toxins. AIR - Get your home vents and ducts cleaned. - Use high-quality, pleated filters on your furnace and change them regularly. Get a high-quality air filter. A leading expert in environmental medicine, Dr. Walter Crinnion says filtering your home air is one of the best ways to limit exposure to some toxins. He recommends the IQAir filter, but says Blue Air and Austin Air are also good. See this page for a description of why these filters are better than a $100-$200 unit: [https://www.modernalchemyair.com/effectiveness/the-modern-alchemy-difference](https://www.modernalchemyair.com/effectiveness/the-modern-alchemy-difference) - Avoid off-gassing products like air fresheners, scented candles and perfumes. WATER - Filter drinking and cooking water. - Install a whole-house carbon block filter, or at least on your shower and kitchen sink. We absorb more potentially carcinogenic hydrocarbons from breathing in a shower than we do from water we drink! OTHER - Use only natural personal care products (toothpaste, creams, shampoo, soaps, etc.) Here are a few websites to help you find products: [http://lesstoxicguide.ca/](http://lesstoxicguide.ca/) [http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/](http://www.ewg.org/skindeep/) - Use only natural cleaning products, such as vinegar, baking soda. - Look for and eliminate any mold, and properly repair any water damage. Remove outdoor footwear at the door so you don't track toxins that have precipitated onto dust and dirt into your house. - Don't handle the thermal, shiny receipts (they contain BPA). - Avoid using triclosan (found most commonly in hand sanitizers). - Use organic clothing or clothes made from natural fibers such as bamboo, hemp, silk, or wool. - Stand upwind of the gas pump when you are gassing up. - Furniture: Consider the chemicals contained in the materials of your furniture, as well as the fire-retardants that may be on them. Pressboard/particle board can off-gas chemicals for up to 15 years. - Remove carpet from your home. - Use only non-toxic paints and materials for construction and home renovations. "}
