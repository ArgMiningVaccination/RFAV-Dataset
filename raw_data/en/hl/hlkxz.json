Let me show you what non-toxic, organic and safe products we use in our home, on our bodies and on our kids.", "sitename": "Mama Instincts\u00ae", "date": "2016-07-28", "cleaned_text": "Many of my friends and readers have asked me what non-toxic products we use in our home. They asked me if I could list them on this blog so they can have easy access to this information and of course I loved the idea. In the past 5+ years I've researched and read a lot about non-toxic items for my family. Sometimes it was really overwhelming since I couldn't find information online easily or had to dig through a lot of different sites to find the best items. So I'm hoping this page helps you and saves you time! I'll be constantly adding different type of items and divide them in categories to make it easy for you. The links on this page are affiliate links, which means I will get a commission if you buy a product - without this affecting the price you pay ( [full disclosure policy](https://mamainstincts.com/disclosure-policy/)). Anything listed on here it's what we actually use and have at home. I will never add a product here that I don't personally use. To buy or learn more about the product click on the picture Non-toxic cleaning supplies: My go-to cleaner is [Force of Nature](https://www.forceofnatureclean.com/ref/mamainstincts/) - it works just like bleach but without the toxic chemicals, and it's the only cleaner you'll ever need.
