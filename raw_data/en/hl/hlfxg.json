In Steiner's view, the natural world was guided by cosmic rhythms and he created anthroposophy with the aim of investigating the spiritual world without the partial and limited approaches of either science or mysticism alone. The basic tenets of anthroposophy were outlined in three of his key works: Theosophy, Occult Science and Knowledge of the Higher Worlds. Steiner studied in Vienna, being particularly fascinated by the natural sciences and the German philosophical tradition. He worked on the team editing Goethe's complete works between 1890 and 1897 and his own work is considered to be an extension of Goethe, for example in his emphasis on understanding the experiential polarities of sensory information. Steiner was a moral individualist and believed in the necessity of awakening the spiritual faculties of human consciousness. He had contact with theosophy and was asked to lead a new German Theosophical Society, which he developed with Marija von Sivers, whom he later married. Steiner differed from the theosophists, notably in their emphasis on Indian thought and on revelations (particularly those of Helena P.Blavatsky\u2014see Blavatsky, Helena). Although Steiner was interested in Indian thought\u2014one of his key projects was a remodelling of the concept of karma\u2014he was more concerned with revitalizing the European Christian tradition. Steiner's anthroposophical work centred around Dornach in Switzerland, where in 1913 construction began on his novel Goetheanum building and the Anthroposophical Society was founded. However, Steiner was never a member of the Society and remained independent, more concerned about social renewal and World War I than the Dornach community. After the first Goetheanum burned down in 1922, divisions within the Anthroposophical Society were apparent and in 1923 Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society to continue his ideals. Steiner generated a number of artistic and social initiatives under the umbrella of anthroposophy, the most enduring of which is in the field of education. Steiner Schools focus on the creative, social and intellectual development of children, drawing on a wide curriculum. The first Waldorfschule was established in 1919 and over 880 Steiner schools exist worldwide, in countries as diverse as Brazil, Singapore, and Zimbabwe. The anthroposophical approach has also been successfully applied to special needs education and adult learning. A second important initiative was the development of anthroposophical medicine with Dr Ita Wegman, a holistic system based on plants and minerals, most popular in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. Anthroposophical thought teaches that the human is composed of four bodies: the 'physical' or material body, the 'etheric' body of formative forces in living matter, the 'astral' body common to humans and animals and the 'ego', blending Jungian ideas of 'ego' and 'self'. Besides medicinal treatments the system advocates nutritional therapy, massage, counselling and artistic therapies, such as Steiner's movement therapy system 'Eurythmy'. The famous Weleda brand of medicines, founded in 1921 in Switzerland, is homoeopathically produced in line with the anthroposophical principles of biodynamic agriculture. "}
