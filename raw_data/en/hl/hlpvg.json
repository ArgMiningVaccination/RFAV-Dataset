There are many ways to use candles in your meditation or yoga practice. Candle gazing, ambiance, and aromatherapy are the most common and powerful ways to initiate an [introspective](https://www.theyoganomads.com/introspection-questions/) meditation. Candle Gazing Meditation Candle gazing meditations are one of the easiest types of meditation for beginners. The candle flame acts as a focal point (called 'drishti' in Sanskrit) where the eyes can stare to help quiet the mind. It is often easier to avoid distractions when you have a grounding force to focus on. To practice candle gazing, place a candle at eye level about 20 from your face and dim the lights to minimize distraction. Get in a comfortable seated position and be sure that your neck will not be strained by looking at the candle. Light the wick and begin deep pranayama breathing while softening your gaze on the flame. Your eyes may water at first, but don't worry, this practice is completely safe and the watering will stop within a few minutes as your sight adjusts. As you [breathe](https://www.theyoganomads.com/tummo-breathing/), allow all distractions to float away. If you feel your mind wandering, return to the present moment by focusing on the flickering flame. Using Candles for Ambiance If you prefer not to stare at a bright flame, you can also use candles to create a relaxing ambiance for your yoga or meditation practice.

Thanks to our ancient psychology, humans have been mesmerized by campfires and candles for [nearly a million years](https://www.livescience.com/19853-fire-fascination.html).
