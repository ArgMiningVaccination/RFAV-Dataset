Micozzi Edinburgh: Churchill Livingstone Elsevier; 2011;ISBN 978-0-7020-3571-5 Energy Medicine: East and West: A Natural History of Qi is a sterling collection of insightful and scholarly chapters, each one quite technical. This engaging and well-organized volume, edited by David Mayorand Marc S. Micozzi, is not really an in-troduction to energy medicine, nor abroad survey of the subject or the eld, nomatter how the book is being marketed.Rather, it is a comprehensive, detailed,and very sophisticated examination of qi for academic scientists and researchers.Accordingly, this is a superb contributionto the ongoing development of a \"basicsciences\" for complementary and alterna-tive medicine (CAM). The two-dozen chapters are uniformly fascinating and authoritative, pennedmostly by expert academic contributors.The content of the chapters, collectively,bridges current biomedical research, con-temporary basic-science theories regardingCAM, bioenergetic and features and correlates physiology and pathophysiology, andesoteric teachings regarding qi. Contribu- tors represent an especially broad range ofmedical specialties and scientic disci- plines, emphasizing published investiga-tors and individuals with professional orscientic background in CAM modalities. The book is divided into ve major sec- tions: global ethnomedical perspectiveson a vital life energy, Chinese medicine'sunderstanding of qi, theory and experi- mental research on qi, treatment modali- ties involving qi, and clinical applications ofqi. The book concludes with a fascinat- ing and revealing content analysis of thedozens of words used by chapter authorsto refer to characteristic features and func-tions of qi(eg, energy, breath, bioeld, ma- trix, quantum, spirit). As a research scientist with a particular interest in conceptual and theoretical as-pects of nonmainstream therapeutic phe-nomena\u2014that is, the \"what\" (boundaries,models) (mechanisms) that, re-spectively dene and explain such phe-nomena\u2014I especially enjoyed the chapterby John A. Ives and Wayne B. Jonas of theSamueli Institute. Their chapter, whichquestioned the value of an \"energy\" met-aphor in describing and making sense ofmodalities typically grouped under the ru-bric of energy medicine, elaborates on adiscourse on this subject that has been on-going for many years. One of the earliestcontributions, in fact, is a famous essaypublished 20 years ago, entitled, \"But Is ItEnergy?\" written by Larry Dossey, thisjournal's founder and executive editor. Ives and Jonas state their claim directly and honestly: We are not so bold as to suggest that we know themechanism for energy medicine. On the contrary, we con-tend that there is legitimate debateover whether there even is such athing as 'subtle energy' (p. 163). They go on to identify and describe sev- eral competing theories for \"the underly-ing mechanisms giving rise to the effectsof energy medicine\" (p. 163). These in-clude explanations based on conventionalunderstandings of energy, the bioeld hy- pothesis, placebo effects, and quantumentanglement; their chapter emphasizesthe latter. The presence of the Ives andJonas chapter is a clear indication that theeditors were seeking critical and expansivethinking on the subject of energy medi-cine and were welcoming of perspectivesthat challenge tacit presumptions and,one might say, that embrace the mysteryof energy medicine. Although this book is subtitled, \"East and West,\" the focus is mostly \"east,\" spe- cically on qi. Other systems or modes of energy medicine or energy healing are notas emphasized. There is not a thing wrongwith that at all\u2014this remains an impecca-ble overview of state-of-the-art theory andresearch regarding qiand its associated paradigm in the context of health, healing,and medical care for a Western audience.But, still, other systems or traditions ofenergy medicine and other worldviews re-garding energy healing are left to a futurevolume by someone else. Contributorsclearly identify, however, the convergen-ces and overlaps among Chinese medicineand other non-Western worldviews whenit comes to features of an energy-medicineparadigm; so this should not be taken as asubstantive criticism. The foreword is written by James L. Os- chman, the author of two outstanding vol-umes on energy medicine. This was thus avery appropriate choice and, indeed, thepresent volume makes an excellent com-plement to the two Oschman books. Thisedited collection is the most comprehen-sive and accessible resource on qiand heal- ing for a Western scientic audience thathas been published to date, and is a lastingcontribution to the scientic literature onenergy medicine.
