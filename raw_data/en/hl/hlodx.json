Routine [childhood](https://www.rxlist.com/childhood/definition.htm) [immunization](https://www.rxlist.com/immunization/definition.htm) with vaccines has reduced the [incidence](https://www.rxlist.com/incidence/definition.htm) of many deadly infectious diseases that were common and caused considerable [morbidity](https://www.rxlist.com/morbidity/definition.htm) and [mortality](https://www.rxlist.com/mortality/definition.htm) [in](https://www.rxlist.com/in/definition.htm) the past.

The main component of vaccines is the [antigen](https://www.rxlist.com/antigen/definition.htm) from specific organisms that generate [immune](https://www.rxlist.com/immune/definition.htm) responses to the particular organisms. Vaccines are purified preparations from weakened or inactivated organisms, the [proteins](https://www.rxlist.com/proteins/definition.htm) or toxins they produce, or from fragments of [genetic](https://www.rxlist.com/genetic/definition.htm) material. Some vaccines are synthetically produced to resemble disease-causing pathogens.
