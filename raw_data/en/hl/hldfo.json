What disorders do we evaluate under th e immune system disorders listings? 1. We evaluate immune system disord ers that cause dysfunction in one or more components of your immune system . a. The dysfunction may be due to problems in antibody production, impaired cell-mediated immunity, a combined type of antibody/cellular deficiency, impai red phagocytosis, or complement deficiency. b. Immune system disorders may result in recurr ent and unusual infections, or inflammation and dysfunction of the body's own tissues. Immune syst em disorders can cause a deficit in a single organ or body system that results in extreme (tha t is, very serious) loss of function. They can also cause lesser degrees of limitations in two or more organs or body systems, and when associated with symptoms or signs, such as severe fatigue, fever, malaise, diffuse musculoskeletal pain, or involuntary weight loss, can also result in extreme limitation. c. We organize the discussions of immune system disorders in three categories: Autoimmune disorders; Immune deficiency disorders, excluding human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection; and HIV infection. 2. Autoimmune disorders (14.00D). Autoimmune disorders are caused by dysfunctional immune responses directed against the body's own tissues, resulting in chronic, multisystem impairments that differ in clinical manifest ations, course, and outcome. They are sometimes referred to as rheumatic diseases, connective tissue disorders, or collagen vascular disorders. Some of the features of autoimmune disorders in adults diffe r from the features of the same disorders in children. 3. Immune deficiency disorders, excluding HIV infection (14.00E). Immune deficiency disorders are characterized by recurrent or unusual infections that respond poor ly to treatment, and are often associated with complications affecting other pa rts of the body. Immune deficiency disorders are classified as either primary (congenital) or acquired . Individuals with immune deficiency disorders also have an increased risk of malignanc ies and of having autoimmune disorders. 4. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (14.00F). HIV infection may be characterized by increased susceptibility to common infections as well as opportunistic in fections, cancers, or other conditions listed in 14.11. B. What information do we need to show t hat you have an immune system disorder? Generally, we need your medical history, a report(s) of a physical examina tion, a report(s) of laboratory findings, and in some instances, appropriate medi cally acceptable imaging or tissue biopsy reports to show that you have an immune system diso rder. Therefore, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain your medical histor y, medical findings, and results of laboratory tests. We explain the information we need in more detail in the sections below. C. Definitions Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 1. Appropriate medically acceptable imaging includes, but is not lim ited to, angiography, x-ray imaging, computerized axial tomography (CAT scan ) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), with or without contrast material, myelography, and radionuclear bone s cans. \"Appropriate\" means that the technique used is the proper one to support the evaluation and diagnos is of the impairment. 2. Constitutional symptoms or signs , as used in these listings, mean s severe fatigue, fever, malaise, or involuntary weight loss. Severe fatigue means a frequent sense of exhaustion that results in significantly reduced physical activity or mental function. Malaise means frequent feelings of illness, bodily discomfort, or lack of well-being that result in significantly reduced physical activity or mental function. 3. Disseminated means that a condition is spread over a c onsiderable area. The type and extent of the spread will depend on your specific disease. 4. Dysfunction means that one or more of the body re gulatory mechanisms are impaired, causing either an excess or deficiency of im munocompetent cells or their products. 5. Extra-articular means \"other than the joints\"; for exampl e, an organ(s) such as the heart, lungs, kidneys, or skin. 6. Inability to ambulate effectively has the same meaning as in 1.00B2b. 7. Inability to perform fine and gross movements effectively has the same meaning as in 1.00B2c. 8. Major peripheral joints has the same meaning as in 1.00F. 9. Persistent means that a sign(s) or symptom(s) has continued over time. The precise meaning will depend on the specific immune system disorder, the usual course of the di sorder, and the other circumstances of your clinical course. 10. Recurrent means that a condition that previously res ponded adequately to an appropriate course of treatment returns after a pe riod of remission or regression. Th e precise meaning, such as the extent of response or remission and the time pe riods involved, will depend on the specific disease or condition you have, the body system affected, the us ual course of the disord er and its treatment, and the other facts of your particular case. 11. Resistant to treatment means that a condition did not resp ond adequately to an appropriate course of treatment. Whether a response is adequa te or a course of treatm ent is appropriate will depend on the specific disease or condition you have, the body system affected, the usual course of the disorder and its treatment, and th e other facts of your particular case. 12. Severe means medical severity as used by the me dical community. The term does not have the same meaning as it does when we use it in conne ction with a finding at the second step of the sequential evaluation processes in \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920, and 416.924. D. How do we document and evaluate th e listed autoimmune disorders? 1. Systemic lupus erythematosus (14.02). Medicaid Disabilit yManual erythematosus (SLE) is a ch ronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ or body system. It is frequently, but not always, accompanied by constitutional symptoms or signs (severe fatigue, fever, malais e, involuntary weight lo ss). Major organ or body system involvement can include: Respiratory (ple uritis, fluctuating cognition (\"lupus fog\"), mood disorders, organic brain syndrome, psychosis), or immune system disorders (inflammatory arthritis) . Immunologically, there is an a rray of circulating serum auto- antibodies and pro- and anti-coa gulant proteins that may occur in a highly variable pattern. b. Documentation of SLE. Generally, but not always, the medi cal evidence will show that your SLE satisfies the criteria in the current \"Criteria for the Cl assification of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\" by the American College of Rheu matology found in the most recent edition of the Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases published by the Ar thritis Foundation. 2. Systemic vasculitis (14.03). a. General. (i) Vasculitis is an inflammati on of blood vessels. It may occur acutely in association with adverse drug reactions, certain chronic infections, and occasionally, malignancies. More often, it is chronic and the cause is unknown. Symptoms vary depending on wh ich blood vessels are involved. Systemic vasculitis may also be associated with other autoimmune disorder s; for example, SLE or dermatomyositis. (ii) There are several clinical pa tterns, including but not limited to polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis. b. Documentation of systemic vasculitis. Angiography or tissue biopsy confirms a diagnosis of systemic vasculitis when the disease is suspect ed clinically. When you have had angiography or tissue biopsy for systemic vasculitis, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain reports of the results of that procedure. However, we will not purchase angiography or tissue biopsy. 3. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) (14.04). a. General. Systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) constitutes a spectrum of disease in which thickening of the skin is the clinical hallmark. Ra ynaud's phenomenon, often medically severe and progressive, is present frequently and may be the peripheral ma nifestation of a vasospastic abnormality in the heart, lungs, and kidneys . The CREST syndrome (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasia) is a variant that may slowly progress over years to the genera lized process, systemic sclerosis. b. Diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. In diffuse cutaneous system ic sclerosis (also known as diffuse scleroderma), major organ or systemic in volvement can include the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, heart, kidneys, and muscle in addition to skin or blood ve ssels. Although arthritis can occur, joint dysfunction results primarily from soft tissue/cutaneous thicke ning, fibrosis, and contractures. Localized scleroderma (linear scleroderma and morphea) is more common in children than in adults. However, this type of sc leroderma can persist in to adulthood. To assess the severity of the impairment, we need a description of the extent of involvement of linear scleroderma and the location of the lesions. For example, linear sc leroderma involving the arm but not crossing any joints is not as functionally limiting as sclerodact yly (scleroderma localized to the fingers). Linear scleroderma of a lower extremity involving skin thickening and atrophy of underlying muscle or bone can result in contractures and leg length discrepancy. In su ch cases, we may evaluate your impairment under the musculoskeletal listings (1.00). (ii) When there is isolated morphea of the f ace causing facial disfigurement from unilateral hypoplasia of the mandible, maxilla, zygoma, or orb it, adjudication may be more appropriate under the criteria in the affected body system, such as special senses and speech (2.00) or mental disorders (12.00). (iii) Chronic variants of these syndromes in clude disseminated fasciitis with lia), and eosinophilia-myalgia syndr ome (often associated with toxins such as toxic oil or contaminated trypt ophan), all of which can impose medically severe musculoskeletal dysfunction and may also lead to re strictive pulmonary disease. We evaluate these variants of the disease under the criteria in the musculoskeletal list ings (1.00) or respiratory system listings (3.00). d. Documentation of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Documentation involves differentiating the clinical features of systemic sclerosis (sclerode rma) from other autoimmune disorders. However, there may be an overlap. 4. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis (14.05). a. General. Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are relate d disorders that are characterized by an inflammatory process in striated muscle, occurring alone or in association w ith other autoimmune disorders or malignancy. The most common mani festations are symmetric weakness, and less frequently, pain and tenderness of the proximal l imb-girdle (shoulder or pelvic) musculature. There may also be involvement of the cervical, cr icopharyngeal, esophageal , intercostal, and diaphragmatic muscles. b. Documentation of polymyositis and dermatomyositis. Generally, but not always, polymyositis is associated with elevated muscle enzymes electromyography and muscle biopsy. In dermatomyositis there are characteristic skin findings in addition to the findings of polymyositis. When you have had electromyogra phy or muscle biopsy for polymyositis or dermatomyositis, we will make every reasonable e ffort to obtain reports of the results of that procedure. However, we will not purcha se electromyography or muscle biopsy. c. Additional information about how we evaluate polymyositis and dermatomyositis under the listings. (i) Weakness of your pelvic girdle muscles that resu lts in your inabili ty to rise independently from a squatting or sitting position or to climb stairs may be an i ndication that you are unable to ambulate effectively. Weakness of your shoulder girdle muscles may result in your inability to Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 perform lifting, carrying, and reaching overhead, a nd also may seriously affect your ability to perform activities requiring fine movements. We evaluate these limitations under 14.05A. (ii) We use the malignant neoplastic diseases lis tings (13.00) to evaluate malignancies associated with polymyositis or dermatomyositis. We evaluate the involvement of other organs/body systems under the criteria for the listings in the affected body system. 5. Undifferentiated and mixed conne ctive tissue disease (14.06). a. General. This listing includes syndromes with clin ical and immunologic fe atures of several autoimmune disorders, but which do not satisfy th e criteria for any of the specific disorders described. For example, you may have clinical feat ures of SLE and systemic vasculitis, and the serologic (blood test) findings of rheumatoid arthritis. b. Documentation of undifferentiated and mixed connective tissue disease. Undifferentiated connective tissue disease is diagnos ed when clinical features a nd serologic (blood test) findings, such as rheumatoid factor or antinuclear antibody (cons istent with an auto immune disorder) are present but do not satisfy the cr iteria for a specific disease. Mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) is diagnosed when clinic al features and serologic findi ngs of two or more autoimmune diseases overlap. 6. Inflammatory arthritis (14.09). a. General. The spectrum of inflammatory arthritis include s a vast array of disorders that differ in cause, course, and outcome. Clinically, inflamma tion of major peripheral joints may be the dominant manifestation causing difficulties with ambulation or fine and gross movements; there may be joint pain, swelling, and te nderness. The arthritis may aff ect other joints, or cause less limitation in ambulation or the performance of fine and gro ss movements. However, in combination with extra-articular features, incl uding constitutional symptoms or signs (severe fatigue, fever, malaise, involuntar y weight loss), inflammatory ar thritis may result in an extreme limitation. b. Inflammatory arthritis involving th e axial spine (spondyloarthropathy). In adults, inflammatory arthritis involving the axial spine may be associated with disorders such as: (i) Beh\u00e7et's disease; and (vi) Inflammatory bowel disease. c. Inflammatory arthritis involving the peripheral joints. In adults, inflammatory arthritis involving peripheral joints may be associ ated with disorders such as: rders (gout and pseudogout); (v) Lyme disease; and (vi) Inflammatory bowel disease. d. Documentation of inflammatory arthritis. Generally, but not alwa ys, the diagnosis of inflammatory arthritis is based on the clinical feat ures and serologic findings described in the most recent edition of the Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases published by the Arthritis Foundation. e. How we evaluate inflammatory arthritis under the listings. (i) Listing-level severity in 14.09A and 14.09C1 is shown by an impairment that results in an \"extreme\" (very serious) limitation. In 14.09A, the criterion is satisfied with persistent inflammation or deformity in one major peripheral we ight-bearing joint resulting in the inability to ambulate effectively (as defined in 14.00C6) or one major peripheral join t in each upper extremity resulting in the inability to perform fine and gross movements effectivel y (as defined in 14.00C7). In 14.09C1, if you have the required ankylosis (fixatio n) of your cervical or dorsolumbar spine, we will find that you have an extreme limitation in y our ability to see in front of you, above you, and to the side. Therefore, inability to ambulate effectively is implicit in 14.09C1, even though you might not require bilate ral upper limb assistance. (ii) Listing-level severity is shown in 14.09B, 14.09C2, and 14.09D by inflammatory arthritis that involves various combinations of complications of one or more ma jor peripheral joints or other joints, such as inflammation or deformity, extra- articular features, repeat ed manifestations, and constitutional symptoms or signs. Extra-articular impairments may al so meet listings in other body systems. (iii) Extra-articular features of inflammatory arthritis may involve any body system; (chronic anemia, thrombocytopenia) , neurologic (peripheral neuropa thy, radiculopathy, spinal cord or cauda equina compression with sensory and motor loss), mental (c ognitive dysfunction, poor memory), and immune system (Felty's syndr ome (hypersplenism with compromised immune competence)). (iv) If both inflammation and ch ronic deformities are present, we evaluate your impairment under the criteria of any a ppropriate listing. 7. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (14.10). Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 a. General. (i) Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome is an immune-mediated disord er of the exocrine glands. Involvement of the lacrimal and salivary glands is the hallmark feature, resulting in symptoms of dry eyes and dry mouth, and possible complications, such as corn eal damage, blepharitis (eyelid inflammation), dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing) , dental caries, and the inability to speak for extended periods of time. Involvement of the exoc rine glands of the upper airways may result in persistent dry cough. (ii) Many other organ systems may be involved, including musculoskeletal (arthritis, myositis), respiratory (interstitial (purpura, nervous system disorders, cranial and peripheral neuropathies), mental (cognitive dysfunction, poor memory), and neoplastic (lymphoma ). Severe fatigue and malaise are frequently reported. Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome may be associated w ith other autoimmune disorders (for example, rheumatoid arthritis or SLE); usually the clinical features of the associated disorder predominate. b. Documentation of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. If you have Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, the medical evidence will generally, but not always, show that your diseas e satisfies the criteria in the current \"Criteria for the Classification of Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome\" by the American College of Rheumatology found in the most recent edition of the Primer on the Rheumatic Diseases published by the Arthritis Foundation. E. How do we document and evaluate immune de ficiency disorders, excluding HIV infection? 1. General. a. Immune deficiency disorders can be classified as: (i) Primary (congenital); for example, Acquired; for example, medication-related. b. Primary immune deficiency disorders are seen ma inly in children. However, recent advances in the treatment of these disorders have allowed many affected children to survive well into adulthood. Occasionally, these disorders are fi rst diagnosed in adolescence or adulthood. 2. Documentation of immune deficiency disorders. The medical evidence must include documentation of the specific type of immune deficiency. Documentati on may be by laboratory evidence or by other generally acceptable methods c onsistent with the prev ailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice. 3. Immune deficiency disorders trea ted by stem cell transplantation. a. Evaluation in the first 12 months. If you undergo stem cell transplantation for your immune deficiency disorder, we will consider you disabled until at least 12 months from the date of the transplant. Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 b. Evaluation after the 12-month period has elapsed. After the 12-month period has elapsed, we will consider any residuals of your immune defi ciency disorder as well as any residual impairment(s) resulting from the treatment , such as complications arising from: (i) Graft-versus-host (GVH) disease. (ii) Immunosuppressant therapy, such as frequent infections. (iii) Significant deteriorati on of other organ systems. 4. Medication-induced immune suppression. Medication effects can resu lt in varying degrees of immune suppression, but most resolve when th e medication is ceased. However, if you are prescribed medication for long-term immune suppr ession, such as after an organ transplant, we will evaluate: a. The frequency and severity of infections. b. Residuals from the organ tr ansplant itself, after the 12-month period has elapsed. c. Significant deterioration of other organ systems. F. How do we document and evaluate HIV infection? Any individual with HIV infecti on, including one with a diagnosis of acquire d immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), may be found disabled under 14.11 if his or her impairment meets the criteria in that listing or is medically equivale nt to the criteria in that listing. 1. Documentation of HIV infection . a. Definitive documentation of HIV infection . We may document a diagno sis of HIV infection by positive findings on one or more of the following definitive laboratory tests: (i) HIV antibody screening test (for example, enzyme immunoassay, or EIA), confirmed by a supplemental HIV antibody test such as the We stern blot (immunoblot), an immunofluorescence assay, or an HIV-1/HIV-2 an tibody differentiation immunoassay. (ii) HIV nucleic acid ( DNA or RNA) detection test (for ex ample, polymerase chain reaction, or PCR). (iii) HIV p24 antigen (p24Ag) test. (iv) Isolation of HIV in viral culture. (v) Other tests that are highly sp ecific for detection of HIV and that are consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge. b. We will make every reasonable effort to obtain th e results of your laboratory testing. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 404.1519f and 416.919f, we will purchase examinations or tests necessary to make a determination in your claim if no ot her acceptable documentation exists. Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 c. Other acceptable document ation of HIV infection . We may also document HIV infection without definitive laboratory evidence. (i) We will accept a persuasive report from a physician that a positive diagnosis of your HIV infection was confirmed by an appr opriate laboratory test(s), such as those described in 14.00F1a. To be persuasive, this report must state that you ha d the appropriate definitive laboratory test(s) for diagnosing your HIV infection and pr ovide the results. The report must also be consistent with the remaining evidence of record. (ii) We may also document HIV infection by the medical history, clinical and laboratory findings, and diagnosis(es) indicated in the medical evidence, provided that such documentation is consistent with the prevailing state of medical kn owledge and clinical prac tice and is consistent with the other evidence in your case record. Fo r example, we will accep t a diagnosis of HIV infection without definitive laboratory evidence of the HIV infection if you have an opportunistic disease that is predictive of a de fect in cell-mediated immunity (f or example, toxoplasmosis of the brain or Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)), and there is no other known cause of diminished resistance to that disease (for example, long-term steroid treatment or lymphoma). In such cases, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain full details of the history, medical findings, and results of testing. 2. Documentation of the manife stations of HIV infection . a. Definitive documentation of mani festations of HIV infection . We may document manifestations of HIV infection by positive findings on definitive laboratory tests, such as culture, microscopic examination of biopsied tissue or ot her material (for example, bronchi al washings), serologic tests, or on other generally acceptable de finitive tests consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice. b. We will make every reasonable effort to obtain the results of your laboratory testing. Pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 404.1519f and 416.919f, we will purchase examinations or tests necessary to make a determination of your claim if no ot her acceptable documentation exists. c. Other acceptable documentation of manifestations of HIV infection . We may also document manifestations of HIV infection with out definitive laboratory evidence. (i) We will accept a persuasive report from a physician that a positive diagnosis of your manifestation of HIV infection was confirmed by an appropriate laboratory test(s). To be persuasive, this report must state that you had the appropriate definitive laboratory test(s) for diagnosing your manifestation of HI V infection and provide the resu lts. The report must also be consistent with the remaining evidence of record. (ii) We may also document manifestations of HIV infection without th e definitive laboratory evidence described in 14.00F2a, provided that such documentation is consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice and is consistent with the other evidence in your case record. For example, many conditions are no w commonly diagnosed based on some or all of the following: Medical history, clinical manifest ations, laboratory finding s (including appropriate medically acceptable imaging), and treatment responses. In such cases, we will make every reasonable effort to obtain full details of the hi story, medical findings, a nd results of testing. Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 3. Disorders associated with HIV infection (14.11A-E) . a. Multicentric Castleman disease (MCD, 14.11A) affects multiple groups of lymph nodes and organs containing lymphoid tissue. This wide spread involvement distinguishes MCD from localized (or unicentric) Castleman disease, which affects only a single set of lymph nodes. While not a cancer, MCD is known as a lymphoproliferative disorder. Its clinic al presentation and progression is similar to that of lymphoma, and its treatment may include radiation or chemotherapy. We require characteristic finding s on microscopic examination of the biopsied lymph nodes or other generally acceptable methods c onsistent with the prev ailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis. Localiz ed (or unicentric) Castleman disease does not meet or medica lly equal the criterion in 14.11A, but we may evaluate it under the criteria in 14.11H or 14.11I. b. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL, 14.11B) originates in the brain, spinal cord, meninges, or eye. Imaging tests (for example, MR I) of the brain, while not diagnostic, may show a single lesion or multiple lesions in the white matte r of the brain. We require characteristic findings on microscopic examination of the cerebral spinal fluid or of the biopsied brain tissue, or other generally acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis. c. Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL, 14.11C) is also known as body cavity lymphoma. We require characteristic findings on microscopic examination of the effusion fluid or of the biopsied tissue from the affected internal or gan, or other generally acceptabl e methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical know ledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis. d. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML, 14.11D) is a progressive neurological degenerative syndrome caused by the John Cunningham (JC) virus in immunosuppressed individuals. Clinical findings of PML include clumsiness, progre ssive weakness, and visual and speech changes. Personality and cognitive changes may also occur. We require appropriate clinical findings, characteristic white matter lesions on MRI, and a positive PCR test for the JC virus in the cerebrospinal fluid to establish the diagnosis. We also accept a positive brai n biopsy for JC virus or other generally acceptable methods consistent wi th the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis. e. Pulmonary Kaposi sarcoma (Kaposi sarcoma in the lung, 14.11E serious form of Kaposi sarcoma (KS). Other internal KS tumors (for example, tumors of the gastrointestinal tract) have a more variable prognosis. We require charac teristic findings on microscopic examination of the induced lavage washings , or of the biopsied transbronchial tissue, or by other generally acceptable methods consistent with the prevailing state of medical knowledge and clinical practice to establish the diagnosis. 4. CD4 measurement (14.11F). To evaluate your HIV infection under 14.11F, we require one measurement of your absolute CD4 count (als o known as CD4 count or CD4+ T-helper lymphocyte count). This measurement must occu r within the period we are considering in connection with your application or continuing disability review . If you have more than one measurement of your absolute CD4 count within th is period, we will use your lowest absolute CD4 count. Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 5. Measurement of CD4 and either body mass index or hemoglobin (14.11G). To evaluate your HIV infection under 14.11G, we require one measur ement of your absolute CD4 count or your CD4 percentage, and either a measurement of your body mass index (BM I) or your hemoglobin. These measurements must occur within the peri od we are considering in connection with your application or continuing disabi lity review. If you have more than one measurement of your CD4 (absolute count or percentage), BMI, or hemoglobi n within this period, we will use the lowest of your CD4 (absolute count or percentage), BMI, or hemoglobin. The date of your lowest CD4 (absolute count or percentage) measurement may be different from the date of your lowest BMI or hemoglobin measurement. We calculate your BMI using the formulas in 5.00G2. 6. Complications of HIV infection requiring hospitalization (14.11H). a. Complications of HIV infection may include in fections (common or oppor tunistic), cancers, and other conditions. Examples of complications that may result in hospitaliza and other severe infections. b. Under 14.11H, we require three ho spitalizations within a 12-mont h period that are at least 30 days apart and that result from a complication(s) of HIV infecti on. The hospitalizations may be for the same complication or different complications of HIV infection and are not limited to the examples of complications that may result in hospitalization listed in 14.00F6a. All three hospitalizations must occur with in the period we are consider ing in connection with your application or continuing disabi lity review. Each hos pitalization must last at least 48 hours, including hours in a hospital emergency depart ment immediately before the hospitalization. c. We will use the rules on medical equiva lence in \u00a7\u00a7 404.1526 and 416.926 to evaluate your HIV infection if you have fewer, but longer, hospi talizations, or more fr equent, but shorter, hospitalizations, or if you receive nursing, rehabilitation, or other care in alternative settings. 7. HIV infection manifestations specific to women . a. General. Most women with severe immunosu ppression secondary to HI V infection exhibit the typical opportunistic infections and other conditions, such as PCP, Candida esophagitis, wasting syndrome, cryptococcosis, and toxoplasmosis. However, HIV infection may have different manifestations in women than in men. Adjudicators must carefully scrutinize the medical evidence and be alert to the variety of medical conditi ons specific to, or common in, women with HIV infection that may affect their ab ility to function in the workplace. b. Additional considerations for evaluating HIV in fection in women. Many of these manifestations (for example, vulvovaginal candidiasis or pelvic inflammatory disease) occur in women with or without HIV infection, but can be more severe or resi stant to treatment, or o ccur more frequently in a woman whose immune system is suppressed. Ther efore, when evaluating the claim of a woman with HIV infection, it is important to consider gynecologic and other prob lems specific to women, including any associated symptoms (for example, pelvic pain), in assessing the severity of the impairment and resulting functional limitations. We may evaluate manifestations of HIV infection in women under 14.11H-I, or under the criteria fo r the appropriate body system (for example, cervical cancer under 13.23). Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 8. HIV-associated dementia (HAD). HAD is an advanced neur ocognitive disorder, characterized by a significant decline in cognitive func tioning. We evaluate HAD under 14.11I. Other names associated with neurocognitive disorders due to HIV infection include: AIDS dementia complex, HIV dementia, HIV encephalopathy, and major ne urocognitive disorder du e to HIV infection. G. How do we consider the effects of treatme nt in evaluating your autoimmune disorder, immune deficiency disorder, or HIV infection? 1. General. If your impairment does not otherwise m eet the requirements of a listing, we will consider your medical treatment in terms of its effectiveness in improving the signs, symptoms, and laboratory abnormalities of your specific immune system disorder or its manifestations, and in terms of any side effects that limit your functioning. We will make every reasonable effort to obtain a specific description of the treatment you receive (incl uding surgery) for your immune system disorder. We consider: a. The effects of medications you take. b. Adverse side effects (acute and chronic). c. The intrusiveness and complexity of your treatm ent (for example, the dosing schedule, need for injections). d. The effect of treatment on your mental functi oning (for example, c ognitive changes, mood disturbance). e. Variability of your respons e to treatment (see 14.00G2). f. The interactive and cumulative effects of your treatments. For example, many individuals with immune system disorders receive treatment both for their immune system disorders and for the manifestations of the disorders or co-occurring impairments, such as treatment for HIV infection and hepatitis C. The interactive and cumulative eff ects of these treatments may be greater than the effects of each treatment considered separately. g. The duration of your treatment. h. Any other aspects of treatment that may interfere with your ab ility to function. 2. Variability of your response to treatment. Your response to treatm ent and the adverse or beneficial consequences of your treatment may vary widely. The e ffects of your treatment may be temporary or long term. For example, some indivi duals may show an initial positive response to a drug or combination of drugs followed by a decrea se in effectiveness. When we evaluate your response to treatment and how your treatment may a ffect you, we consider such factors as disease activity before treatment, requirements for changes in therapeutic regimens, the time required for therapeutic effectiveness of a pa rticular drug or drugs, the limite d number of drug combinations that may be available for your impairment(s), a nd the time-limited efficacy of some drugs. For example, an individual with HIV infection or a nother immune deficiency disorder who develops pneumonia or tuberculosis may not respond to the same antibiotic regimen used in treating individuals without HIV infection or another immune deficiency disorder, or may not respond to Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 an antibiotic that he or she responded to before. Therefore, we must cons ider the effects of your treatment on an individual basis, including the eff ects of your treatment on your ability to function. 3. How we evaluate the effects of treatment for au toimmune disorders on your ability to function. Some medications may have acute or long-term si de effects. When we consider the effects of corticosteroids or other treatments for autoi mmune disorders on your ab ility to function, we consider the factors in 14.00G 1 and 14.00G2. Long-term corticosteroid treatment can cause ischemic necrosis of bone, posterior subcapsu lar cataract, weight gai n, glucose intolerance, increased susceptibility to infection, and osteopo rosis that may result in a loss of function. In addition, medications used in the treatment of autoimmune disorders may also have effects on mental functioning, including cognition (for example, memory), concentration, and mood. 4. How we evaluate the effects of treatment fo r immune deficiency disorders, excluding HIV infection, on your ability to function. When we consider the eff ects of your treatment for your immune deficiency disorder on your ability to function, we consider th e factors in 14.00G1 and 14.00G2. A frequent need for treatment such as intravenous immunoglobulin and gamma interferon therapy can be intrusive and interfere w ith your ability to work. We will also consider whether you have chronic side effects from thes e or other medications, including severe fatigue, fever, headaches, high blood pressure, joint swelling, muscle aches, nausea, shortness of breath, or limitations in mental function including cognition (for example, memory), concentration, and mood. 5. How we evaluate the effects of treatment for HIV infection on your ability to function . a. General. When we consider the effect s of antiretroviral drugs (inc luding the effects of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART )) and the effects of treatments for the manifestations of HIV infection on your ability to func tion, we consider the factors in 14.00G1 and 14.00G2. Side effects of antiretroviral drugs include, but are not limited to: Bone marrow suppression, pancreatitis, gastrointestinal intole rance (nausea, vomiting, neuropathy, (fat redistribution, such as \"buffalo hu mp\"), glucose intolerance, and lactic acidosis. In addition, medications used in the treatment of HIV infection ma y also have effects on mental functioning, including cognition (for example, me mory), concentration, and mood, and may result in malaise, severe fatigue, joint and muscle pain, and insomnia. The symptoms of HIV infection and the side effects of medication may be indisti nguishable from each other. We will consider all of your functional limitations, whethe r they result from your sympto ms or signs of HIV infection or the side effects of your treatment. b. Structured treatment interruptions. A structured treatment interruption (STI, also called a \"drug holiday\") is a treatment practice during which your treating source advises you to stop taking your medications temporarily. An STI in itself does not imply that your medical condition has improved; nor does it imply that you are noncomp liant with your treatment because you are following your treating source's advice. Therefore, if you have stopped taking medication because your treating source prescribed or recommended an STI, we will not find that you are failing to follow treatment or draw inferences about the severity of your impa irment on this fact alone. We will consider why your treating source has prescr ibed or recommended an STI and all the other information in your case record when we de termine the severity of your impairment. 6. When there is no record of ongoing treatment. If you have not received ongoing treatment or have not had an ongoing relationship with the medical community desp ite the existence of a severe Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 impairment(s), we will evaluate the medical severi ty and duration of your immune system disorder on the basis of the current objective medical ev idence and other evidence in your case record, taking into consideration your me dical history, symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings, and medical source opinions. If you have just begun treatment and we cannot determine whether you are disabled based on the evidence we have, we may need to wait to determine the effect of the treatment on your ability to function. The amount of time we need to wait will depend on the facts of your case. If you have not received treatment, you may not be able to show an impairment that meets the criteria of one of the immune system disorders listings, but your immune system disorder may medically equal a listing or be disabling ba sed on a consideration of your residual functional capacity, age, education, and work experience. H. How do we consider your symptoms, includi ng your pain, severe fatigue, and malaise? Your symptoms, including pain, severe fatigue, a nd malaise, may be important factors in our determination whether your immune system disorder(s) meets or me dically equals a listing or in our determination whether you are otherwise able to work. In or der for us to consider your symptoms, you must have medical signs or la boratory findings showing the existence of a medically determinable impairment(s) that could reasonably be expected to produce the symptoms. If you have such an impairment(s), we will eval uate the intensity, persistence, and functional effects of your symptoms using the rules thr oughout 14.00 and in our ot her regulations. See \u00a7\u00a7 404.1528, 404.1529, 416.928, and 416.929. Additionally, when we assess the credibility of your complaints about your symptoms and their functional effects, we will not draw any inferences from the fact that you do not receive treatment or that you are not following treatment without considering all of the relevant evidence in your case recor d, including any explanations you provide that may explain why you are not receiving or following treatment. I. How do we use the functional criteria in these listings? 1. The following listings in this body system in clude standards for evaluating the functional limitations resulting from immune system disord ers: 14.02B, for systemic lupus erythematosus; Sj\u00f6gren 's syndrome; and 14.11I, for HIV infection. 2. When we use one of the listings cited in 14.00I 1, we will consider all relevant information in your case record to determine the full impact of your immune system disorder on your ability to function on a sustained basis. Important factor s we will consider when we evaluate your functioning under these listings include, but are not limited to: Your symptoms, the frequency and duration of manifestations of your immune system disorder, periods of exacerbation and remission, and the functional impact of your treatment, including the side effects of your medication. 3. As used in these listings, \"repea ted\" means that the manifestati ons occur on an average of three times a year, or once every 4 months, each lasting 2 weeks or more; or the manifestations do not last for 2 weeks but occur substantially more freque ntly than three times in a year or once every 4 months; or they occur less frequently than an aver age of three times a year or once every 4 months but last substantially longer than 2 weeks. Your impairment will satisfy this criterion regardless of whether you have the same kind of manifestation repeatedly, all different manifestations, or any other combination of manifestations; for example, two of the same kind of manifestation and a Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 different one. You must have the required num ber of manifestations with the frequency and duration required in this section. Also, the manifestations must occur within the period covered by your claim. 4. To satisfy the functional criteri on in a listing, your immune syst em disorder must result in a \"marked\" level of limitation in one of three genera l areas of functioning: Ac tivities of daily living, social functioning, or difficulties in completi ng tasks due to deficiencies in concentration, persistence, or pace. Functional limitation may resu lt from the impact of the disease process itself on your mental functioning, physic al functioning, or both your me ntal and physical functioning. This could result from persistent or intermittent symptoms, such as depression, severe fatigue, or pain, resulting in a limitation of your ability to do a task, to concentrate, to persevere at a task, or to perform the task at an acceptabl e rate of speed. You may also have limitations because of your treatment and its side effects (see 14.00G). 5. Marked limitation means that the signs and sympto ms of your immune syst em disorder interfere seriously with your ability to function. Although we do not require the use of such a scale, \"marked\" would be the fourth point on a five -point scale consisting of no limitation, mild limitation, moderate limitation, marked limitation, and extreme limitation. 6. Activities of daily living include, but are not limited to, such activities as doing household chores, grooming and hygiene, using a post office , taking public transportation, or paying bills. We will find that you have a \"marked\" limitation of activities of daily livi ng if you have a serious limitation in your ability to maintain a househol d or take public transportation because of symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxi ety, or difficulty concen trating, caused by your immune system disorder (including manifestations of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to perform some self-care activities. 7. Social functioning includes the capacity to interact inde pendently, appropriately, effectively, and on a sustained basis with others. It includes the ability to communi cate effectively with others. We will find that you have a \"marked\" limitation in maintaining social functioning if you have a serious limitation in social inte raction on a sustained basis because of symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxiety, or di fficulty concentrating, or a patt ern of exacerbation and remission, caused by your immune system disorder (including ma nifestations of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to communicate with close friends or relatives. 8. Completing tasks in a timely manner involves the ability to sustain concentration, persistence, or pace to permit timely completion of tasks commonl y found in work settings. We will find that you have a \"marked\" limitation in completing tasks if you have a serious limita tion in your ability to sustain concentration or pace ade quate to complete work-related tasks because of symptoms, such as pain, severe fatigue, anxi ety, or difficulty concentrati ng, caused by your immune system disorder (including manifestations of the disorder) or its treatment, even if you are able to do some routine activities of daily living. J. How do we evaluate your immune system disord er when it does not meet one of the listings? 1. These listings are only examples of immune sy stem disorders that we consider severe enough to prevent you from doing any gainful ac tivity. If your impairment(s) does not meet the criteria of any of these listings, we must also consider whether you have an impairment(s) that satisfies the criteria of a listing in another body system. Medicaid Disabilit yManual 151 2. Individuals with immune system disorders, including HIV infection, may manifest signs or symptoms of a mental impairment or of another physical impairment. For example, HIV infection may accelerate the onset of conditions such as diabetes or affect the course of or treatment options for diseases such as cardiovasc ular disease or hepatitis. We may evaluate these impairments under the affected body system. For example, we will evaluate: a. Musculoskeletal involvement, such as su rgical reconstruction of a joint, under 1.00. b. Ocular involvement, such as dry eye, under 2.00. c. Respiratory impairments, such as pleuritis, under 3.00. d. Cardiovascular impairments, su ch as cardiomyopathy, under 4.00. e. Digestive impairments, such as hepatitis (including he patitis C) or weight loss as a result of HIV infection that affects th e digestive system, under 5.00. f. Genitourinary impairments, such as nephropathy, under 6.00. g. Hematologic abnormalities, such as anemia, granulocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia, under 7.00. h. Skin impairments, such as persistent f ungal and other infectious skin eruptions, and photosensitivity, under 8.00. i. Neurologic impairments, such as neuropathy or seizures, under 11.00. j. Mental disorders, such as depressi on, anxiety, or cognitive deficits, under 12.00. k. Allergic disorders, such as asthma or atopic dermatitis, under 3.00 or 8.00 or under the criteria in another affected body system. l. Syphilis or neurosyphilis under the criteria for the affected body system; for example, 2.00 Special senses and speech, 4.00 Cardiova scular system, or 11.00 Neurological. 3. If you have a severe medically determinable impairment(s) that does not meet a listing, we will determine whether your impairment(s) medi cally equals a listing. (See \u00a7\u00a7 404.1526 and 416.926.) If it does not, you may or may not have the residu al functional capacity to engage in substantial gainful activity. Therefore, we proceed to the f ourth, and if necessary, the fifth steps of the sequential evaluation process in \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520 and 416.920. We use the rules in \u00a7\u00a7 404.1594, 416.994, and 416.994a as appropriate, when we decide whether you continue to be disabled.
