(Nasdaq: VBIV) (VBI), a biopharmaceutical company driven by immunology in the pursuit of powerful prevention and treatment of disease, today announced plans to focus the Company's efforts on the fight against hepatitis B (HBV), concentrating on broadening access to VBI's FDA-approved 3-antigen HBV vaccine for adults, and advancing its HBV immunotherapeutic candidate, VBI-2601, which has the potential to be part of a functional cure regimen for chronic HBV patients. Jeff Baxter, VBI's President and CEO, commented: \"The potential impact our HBV programs can have on public health and patients' lives continues to grow - already this year, with the necessary infrastructure now in place, we've seen an encouraging increase of PreHevbrio use in the U.S., and we've reported positive interim Phase 2 data from a combination study of our HBV immunotherapeutic and an siRNA candidate. Today's announcement is part of a focused effort to enable us to achieve our corporate objectives and continue to contribute meaningfully to this fight against hepatitis B. We believe these difficult decisions and actions better position VBI to deliver value to patients, our public health partners, and our investors. These decisions, however, were not taken lightly and I would like to extend my sincere thanks to all employees affected by this restructuring for their steadfast dedication to our mission and for their contributions to VBI's progress to date.\" About the Organizational Changes As part of this commitment, the company intends to reduce its internal workforce by 30-35% - a reduction which is expected to begin in April and complete by the end of June 2023. As a result of this and other reductions in spend, VBI also expects its operating expenses from normal business to be 30-35% lower in the second half of 2023 as compared with the second half of 2022. Additionally, by mutual agreement, Christopher McNulty, VBI's current Chief Financial Officer, Head of Business Development, and director, will resign from the Company and the Board of Directors effective April 10, 2023. In his place, the Company and its Board of Directors have appointed Nell Beattie, VBI's current Chief Business Officer, as the new Chief Financial Officer and Head of Corporate Development. Ms. Beattie has also been elected to VBI's Board. During her eight years at VBI, Ms. Beattie has built significant senior leadership experience, leading and contributing to various functions and teams including corporate strategy, corporate development, capital financing, commercial strategy, marketing, communications, investor relations, legal, and human resources. Preceding the appointment of Mr. McNulty, Ms. Beattie also served as VBI's interim CFO from September 2017 to August 2018, and in her time at the Company, has worked on numerous financings raising more than $180 million. Prior to VBI, Ms. Beattie was a financial and strategic consultant at Artisan Healthcare Consulting. Ms. Beattie received her Bachelor of Arts in Mathematics from Dartmouth College, and a Master of Business Administration from the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College. About the Reverse Stock Split VBI's Board of Directors approved a 1-for-30 reverse stock split of its issued and outstanding common shares. The reverse stock split is anticipated to become effective as of 12:01 AM on Wednesday, April 12, 2023, at which time every 30 shares of VBI's issued and outstanding common shares will be converted automatically into one issued and outstanding common share. VBI's common shares are expected to begin trading on a split-adjusted basis as of the commencement of trading on Wednesday, April 12, 2023. VBI's common shares will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \"VBIV\" with a new CUSIP number of 91822J202. The reverse stock split is intended to enable VBIV to regain compliance with Nasdaq's continued listing requirements. The reverse stock split will reduce the number of outstanding common shares from 258,257,494 to approximately 8.6 million shares, subject to adjustment for fractional share rounding, as applicable. The reverse stock split will affect all registered shareholders equally and will not alter any shareholder's percentage interest in the Company's equity, except to the extent the reverse stock split would result in any shareholder owning a fractional share. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse stock split. Per the requirements of the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), under which the Company is regulated, if fractional shares held by registered shareholders are to be converted into whole shares, each fractional share remaining after the completion of the consolidation that is less than half of a share must be cancelled and each fractional share that is at least half of a share must be rounded up to one whole share. No shareholders will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares. Proportional adjustments will be made to the number of shares of the Company's common shares issuable upon exercise of options and warrants, as well as the applicable exercise price. Beneficial shareholders should contact their bank, broker, or custodian for additional information on how the reverse stock split will affect their holdings. Computershare is acting as the exchange and transfer agent for the reverse stock split and registered shareholders may direct questions to Computershare by calling them at 1-800-564-6253 (U.S. and Canada) or 1-514-982-7555 (outside North America), or by writing them at [corporateactions@computershare.com](mailto:corporateactions@computershare.com).
