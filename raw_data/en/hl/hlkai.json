Are you content with where you are right now? Do you know what you are here on this Earth to do? What does living a healthy and fulfilled life mean to you? A few years ago, I had no idea of the answer to those question s, but I certainly would have liked to have known how to find that soul-fulfilling inner joy and sense of wellbeing that we all strive for . The truth is, for many years, I was desperately unhappy in my life, yet I didn' t know what to do or how to change my situation until I finally found the courage to break free of my old life. I had what socie ty often refers to as a \"good life,\" and looking in from an outsider 's perspective, everything appeared to be perfect. I lived in a big clifftop inner -city house which contained all the things that made my life comfortable. My first article had just been published in a prominent New Zealand magazine, and I had a promising career in freelance journalism ahead of me. I was engaged and planning my wedding. However , despite everything, I was miserable. The unhappiness affected my health, and I began experiencing chronic and debilitating attacks of vertigo and dizziness where I couldn' t leave my bed for weeks at a time. I someh ow knew that my life had gone drastically off course, and my body was trying to tell me that it was time for a change. I was tired ofmerely going through the motions of a life, which I had created without any real authenticity to my true self, and I eventually hit rock bottom. But in that mom ent of despair , I expe rienced an aha moment that would be the most important turning point in my life. I knew there had to be more to life than lying in bed and wallo wing in self-pity . So, I finally found the courage to take action. I gave notice on the lease of my house, packed up my most cherished possessions, and sold, gifted, and donated a lifetime of accumul ated stuff to charity . I broke up with my fianc\u00e9, moved into my campervan, and I set off alone on a pilgrimage of healing and self-discovery . In a matter of days, I went from having everything to nothing, in a material sense, and I freedom-camped in my campervan around the North Island of New Zealand with only my dog for company . I ditched the makeup and designer clothes for comfy van attire, showered in cold public showers, ate a simple whole foods vegetarian diet, and the stars and moon became my nightly entertainments. It seemed the more I simplified my life, the more I was able to reconnect to my true self, away from all the distractions that we often have in life. From this new space of awareness, beyond societal and familial conditioning, I awakened to who I really was, and I discovered what I truly wanted to manif est in my life, which was radically different from how I had been living. My passion for yoga was too strong to ignore, so I decided to go to India and learn yoga at the root source so that I could combine my skills as a Reiki healer and use my naturopathic knowledge to help others. After many hours of research, I finally found a course that resonated with me, and after six months of solitary living in my van, I boarded a plane to India. My pilgrimage led me to 21 towns and seven states throughout India. I fell in love with the Himalayas and lived in Nepal for half a year. Then the hippy vibes of Byron Bay in Australia called to me. One year later, I returned to India to teach yoga before landing my dream yoga teaching job in Bali.With a whole lot of new life experiences and soul lessons under my belt, I eventually returned home to New Zealand and established a holistic wellness practic e, however , living in a house back in my hometown of Auckland remin ded me of why I had initially left, so with my new-found knowledge alongside another year of life lessons, I once again sold and donated all of my belongings, packed my trusty yet well-used suitcase, and boarded a plane back to Australia. Round two in Australia was a much more enjoyable experience than the first time I lived there. My partner and I bought a 1997 Mercedes Motorhome that we called Bessie, and we set off to do a lap of the country while building our online businesses. A few months went by, and the Aussie dream felt like it was slowly slipping through my fingers. I didn' t find happiness there, and in a twist of fate, I suddenly found myself back in New Zealand, where I eventually decided to make Queenstown my home. Of all the teachers and people I met along the way; my biggest teacher has been life itself. Six years of soul searching, travelling, and living out of a suitcase certainly brought some lessons! I am not a medical doctor , PhD holder , guru, or psychologist, and I don't proclaim to have all the answers. The universe is infinite, and those who think they know it all usually have a lot to learn! I'm not suggesting that you need to give up everything and follow in my footsteps either , because everyone' s journey is different, and we each need to follow our own unique path. However , I sure have picked up some golden nuggets of wisdom along the way . Believe me, I know what it's like to have the odds stacked against me. I was brought up in a working-cl ass family , and as a child, I lived in a tent with my parents, where we often relied on food supplied by community organizations. I became a single mother at 17, and I was reliant on receiving state welfare to survive. I often struggled from paycheck to paycheck to pay my rent and buy food while trying to single-handedly raise my daughter , who suf fered from a range of serious health conditions. I know what it's like to live in financial hardship and to feel unhappy , misunderstood, and alone. But if I had known then what I know now, I might have saved myself a lot of unnecessary pain, poor health, and heartache.I now wake up each day feeling truly grateful that I have manifested a life that I had previously only dreamed of. I wake up each day feeling so blessed to be carrying out work that is both fulfilling and inspiring to me. I wake up each day full of enthu siasm, vitality , and creative energy, and I finally , after many years of soul searching, feel happy from deep within. I truly believe that some people tend to stay stuck in their lives, I know I was this person, because they don't realize their true power of free will and choice. Healing chronic health problems and remaining healthy and happy is achievable. How do I know? Because I have been where you are now. I have healed over 70 health conditions and symptoms and I have managed to remain symptom free. In this book I am going to share with you practical tools and the exact steps I took to heal myself so you can make the right lifestyle choices that will ultimately steer you in the direction of a healthier , happier , symptom free life filled with prosperity and abundance. When we are born, we aren' t given a guidebook on how to remain happy and healthy , and as we become older , we often lose that intrinsic feel- good feeling. In most cases, our parents and caregivers did their best to teach us, but more often than not, they had no idea how to increase their own sense of wellbeing. During my quest for the keys to good health, I discovered that health and happiness is a multi-dimens ional process. For true healing to occur , we must equally acknowledge the mind, body , heart, soul, spirit, and energetic system, because if one part isn' t functioning, it af fects the whole. If you neglect your mental health, you might feel a range of difficult emotions and experience challenging life situations. If you neglect your physical health, you may feel tired, unwell, or you might suffer from a chronic health condition. If you neglect your heart, you might find yourself on the wrong path in life. If you neglect the health of your soul, you might find yourself feeling detached and stuck in a trauma loop. If you neglect your spirit, you might lack the will power to carry on or actualize new habits. If you neglect your energetic health, you may find you have hit a wall in your healing or you might suf fer from a combination of everything! Our current health model focuses on one's physical health, and the spiritual, mental, emotional, and energetic aspects are often overlookedbecause we can' t see them, or they don' t garner tangible results. So, if you have spent years searching for the answers to your chronic health issues, if you feel that your mental habits and emotions get in the way of living to your fullest potential, or if you lack a deep sense of purpose, fulfilm ent, motivation, or enthusiasm for life, then this book is for you. Sadly , conventio nal medicine doesn' t address the root cause of most chronic health conditions, and for true healing to occur , all six dimensions of wellness must be understood and addressed. This book is a manifestation of my soul' s calling, and I have written it within a holistic context, which is designed to encompass your entire being. The content has ebbed and flowed over the past five years when I first started writing. It is a culmination of everything that I have learned in my life\u2014from reading countless self-help and spiritual books, attending self- development workshops, completing Reiki degrees and yoga teacher training courses, studying naturopathy , human bioener getics, Medical Medium information, health coaching, and healing myself and my daughter 's chronic health conditions. Listening to Satsang' s with modern- day enlightened masters, and from my nine-month pilgrimage throughout India and Nepal. It is a manifesto of many years of trial and error , researching the latest natural health solutions to a range of chronic illnesses, and some serious soul searching! It contains a lot of thought-provoking information, which may challenge your belief system. So, to get the most out of it, I encourage you to read it with an open mind and an open heart, and if what you read feels uncomfortable, I invite you to sit with the feeling and ask yours elf, \"Where is this discomfort arising from?\" Start with the chapters that stand out to you the most, or close your eyes, ask that your intuition guide you to what you most need to read at this moment, and open the book up to a page. It's entirely up to you. Chances are, you are ready to learn something new and transform your life, or you wouldn' t have been drawn to this book. It is my intentio n to inspire you to be the most authentic version of yourself so that you too can find your soul calling. I hope that awakening to the truth of who you are will give you the courage to follow the path thatyour soul intend ed and to live a healthy , joy-filled life, packed with passion and purpose. After all, it is your birthright to thrive. I am a mother , teacher , healer , and student who is dancing barefoot through life, learning, growing, laughing, and crying along the way . My soul's calling is to educate, inspire, and guide people along their path back to wellness, and I feel truly humbled to be a part of your journey toward better health and wellbeing. In health and happiness, Taleta xoPART 1 Mental and Emotional W ellness \"To understand the immeasurable, the mind must be extraordinarily quiet, still.\" - JIDDU KRISHNAMUR TIF CHAPTER ONE Understanding Your Mind to Transform Your Life or as long as I can remember , I suffered from debilitating anxiet y and panic attacks so extreme that I couldn' t leave my house for long periods of time. Anxiety impacted every area of my life. My relationships, career , and health suffered. Deep down, I was a scared little girl trapped in an adult' s body, and I didn' t know how to break free from my symptoms. At my wit's end, I began searching for answers, when I suddenly stumbled upon British hypnotherapist, Marisa Peer. After trawling through countless YouTube videos and reading everything she had ever written on anxiety , I decided to try one of her group hypnotherapy sessions. I alway s knew the mind was powerful and capable of shaping my reality; however , it didn' t sink in until one of the group sessions I attended. Don' t get me wrong, I'm not saying that anxiety , mental illness, or any chronic health condition is in your head. There are physical reasons behind the epidemic of chronic illness, which I will explain in chapter seven, \"The Three D's: Detox, Diet, and De-stress.\" However , the mind directly influences our sense of wellbeing and overall experience of life. The aha moment came when Peer said, \"The mind does what it thinks you want it to do, and it does what you tell it to do, it is wired to detect whatcauses us pain and it makes sure it avoids it at all costs for the rest of your life.\" Those words reverberated insid e my head. Until then, my life hadn' t been going so well, and I quick ly realized that if I wanted to get different results in my life, I had to change my mindset! So, if the mind' s primary function is to keep us away from pain, we need to ensure what we are telling it is positive. For example, if you say to yourself \"This job is killing me\" on your way to work, it will create a scenario to get you away from your job. The next morning, you might find yourself waking up with the flu, and you end up needing to take the day off work. Or, say you don't like drinking celery juice, and you tell yourself \"I hate celery juice,\" but you want to be healthier . By changing your language from \"I hate celery juice\" to \"I choose to drink celery juice because I want to feel healthy ,\" you bypass the part of your brain that says, \"Let me shut down anything you tell me you don't like.\" When you use the correc t language, you can reprogram your brain and literally make yourself like anything. Most of us know that positive thinking is generally better for us, but if you start to become aware of your thoughts, you will begin to notice how you communicate with yoursel f. The thing is, your mind doesn' t care if what you tell it is wrong or right, good or bad, healthy or unhealthy . It simply believes it, so you need to be really clear with what you say to it. Your beliefs and your body act in ways that match your thinking . So, try to become aware of what you're telling yourself. If you're trying to change a habit or carry out a task that you don't particularly enjoy , like washing and juicing celery, instead of focusing on negative, self-limitin g thoughts, change your language to \"I am choosing to do this.\" When you give yourself the wrong information, you get the wrong results. It's not just about positive thinking; it's about specific communication with your mind. As soon as you treat your mind like a team member , it will support your deepest desires. All of this nega tive self-talk really held me back in life. Even worse, I wasn' t aware of how I was talking to myself. I wouldn' t speak to a friend like that, let alone a person who wasn' t my friend, so why on earth was I talking to myself like this?Negative or painful words send powerful messages to the brain, and their primordial mechanisms kick in to protect you from pain, often leading to undes irable results in life. You might be wondering how to change the internal dialogue, which runs on automatic replay , so you can kick that mean person to the curb once and for all! Well, here' s the secret. If you want your mind to be on your team, to help motivate and inspire you, you need to use positive language. We must learn to use the right language, so the mind doesn' t have to come up with resistance or distraction. It sounds so simple, right? The best way to start practicing is to become the silent observer of your thoughts while remaining in a place of non-judgment. The more we show up as conscious participants in life, the more we stop believing the mean person!So where did this mean person come from? The root source of suffering and unhappiness lies in how we think, and how we see the world is shape d by our thoughts and beliefs, which often stems from child hood experienc es. The first few years of life are when we download all the data, which makes up our core beliefs, but, for better or worse, this downloaded bluepr int can have a significant impact on our experience of abundance and happiness in adult life. Your brain is wired to keep returning to what is familiar and reject what is unfamiliar . Try to think back into your childhood and ask yourself, \"What was familiar?\" Did you feel loved? Did you get the attention that you wanted? Did you feel supported? Did you feel that you were seen, valued, and heard? Did you experience abundance? W ere your needs met? Because the mind is hardwired to always return to what is familiar; what we experienced as a child is often repeated in adulthood. The beliefs that we form from our experiences as children determine our inner dialogue. You might already be aware of the constant stream of chatter inside your head. Whether it is a little voice that says you should or shouldn' t do something or a loud and critical bossy one, we make decisions based on our inner dialogue. However , we don't realize the internal critic is conditioned programs from the past. It is not a true representa tion of our adult self, which exists in the here and now . These blueprints are how you learned to survive in the world, and they are not a reflec tion of your higher self. Seventy percent of conditioned programs that were downloaded before the age of seven are disempowering, self-limiting, and self-sabotaging, and they don't support your wishes and desires. The worst bullies you will ever encounter in your life are your own thoughts, and using harsh, critical words to describe yourself is a major contributor to low self-esteem. We all have an inner critic which says we aren' t good enough, worthy , loveable, talented, attractive, intelligent, capable, or skinny enou gh. And we stumble along in life, either trying to prove these beliefs wrong by creating a life that shows otherwise while still feeling the same inside, or we create scenarios of self-defeating or self-sabotaging situations because we believe the thoughts to be true.Either way, we are living in denial of our true selves when we carry these deep-seated beliefs around , and everything we do is based on trying to make up for the deep sense of lack, which originates from a lack of knowing oneself. A FEELING FOLLOWS A THOUGHT , AN ACTION USUALL Y FOLLOWS A FEELING, AND ACTION AL WAYS CREA TES A RESUL T. SO, IF WE W ANT T O ENSURE POSITIVE RESUL TS IN ALL AREAS OF OUR LIFE, WE MUST FIRST LOOK A T OUR STATE OF MIND, WHICH HOLDS THE KEYS T O HAPPINESS AND ABUNDANCE. Your subconsci ous mind is your default. Say, for instance, you are driving a car, and you start talking to the person next to you then you arrive at your destinati on, and you suddenly realize that you weren' t even aware of driving from A to B. The moment your conscious mind engaged in conversation; your subconscious mind automatically took over driving the car. In most instances, your subco nscious mind is unsupportive to your success because its primary function is to keep you alive from real or perceived threats, such as when driving a car . To creat e true lasting happiness, try to tune in to your higher self which exists in the present moment. Practice being mindful of your thoughts, feelings, and actions by being fully present rather than living from a place of reaction or making decisions based on outdated programs you developed in your childhood. Remember , the most important communication we have is the ability to communicate with ourselves. When you communicate with yourself in adetailed, precise, relevant, and specific way, your mind will help you move forward toward your goals. When you use the wrong language, it confuses your mind, hindering its ability to help you. It's a bit like when we update our phones and computers. We need to update our software to get rid of the bugs (outdated beliefs and programs from the past) by dialoguing with ourselves more efficiently to get what we truly want in life. Ultimately , our perceptions determine how we feel, and our perception is entire ly based on past cond itioning and programming. A person who fears the water because they had a near-death experience in the ocean will look at the sea differently from a surfer , for which it evokes entirely different feeling s. Therefore, we cannot expect others to see things the way we do because we all see things dif ferently . We see things differently because we have all had different life experiences which have shaped who we are. Those experiences create the filters from which we see the world via information that passes through neural pathways which sends information to our brain. To an extent, we are all wearing different colored glasses through which we view the world, and the picture may be very different from that of another person looking at the same thing. If you have ever been to an amusement park, you can't tell if the people are screaming from fear or excitement while riding a rollercoaster . And here' s the thing\u2014your mind can't tell the difference betwe en fear or excitement. So, the next time you feel a sense of adrenaline, even if you feel scared or anxious, learn to say to yourself \"I'm excited.\" Your mind believes what you tell it, and the pictures and words you use make your reality . Let me repeat. The way you feel about something comes down to two things. The pictures you make in your head and the words you say to yourself. So, ensure what you are telling yourself is in alignment with what you truly want. Your beliefs, thoughts, and mind are there to change. That' s the only control that exists! Can a healthy mind result in a healthy body? According to leading epi-genetic scientist Dr Bruce Lipton, our beliefs can change our genetic expression, and our mind is capable of either healing or manifesting disease within the body .Scientific studies have demo nstrated the placebo effect, positive thoughts that are capable of healing subjects who were given sugar pills. The same is also true for the nocebo effect, which shows that negative beliefs can hinder healing. For example, if you receive a diagnosis from a doctor whom you trust and respect and they tell you that your body is attacking itself or your conditio n is incurable, you believe it. The sad thing is, when you believe your body has turned against you and you doubt your body' s innate ability to heal, your soul becomes injured, and healing is weakened. Dr Bruce Lipton says beliefs are energy fields capable of manifesting healing within the body , yet we have been programmed to believe that we are victims of our genetics, and Anthony William, the Medical Medium says that misinformed and incorrect diagnoses can create emotional injuries that damage the soul and weaken the spirit. The new science suggests that diseases such as cancer are caused by epigenetic factors such as toxins and pathogens, and not from a defective gene. What a relief to know that our genetic blueprint is not the problem; it's the environment and how our cells interpret information , which is influenced by factors outside our cells. According to NES theory , the mind resides in the liquid matrix aspect of the human body-field. The liquid matrix is a superconductive, interconnecting matrix that is formed from connective tissues of the body . Scientific resear cher Peter Fraser found that thoughts and emotions exist in the human body -field as small packets of energy that can be detected and harmonized when needed. Cutting-edge research shows us that childhood and emotional traumas can become imprinted into the human body' s energetic system , and these electromagnetic oscillations are often the root cause of chronic illness and disease. Our lives are a bit like a movie, and our minds are the projector . Therefore, a healthy mind is a critical component of wellbeing . Our mind has the power to create and shape our reality and experience here on Earth. If we want to become the consc ious drivers of our lives and manifest good health, happine ss, and abundance, rather than living from a place of reaction or feeling like a victim of our predispositions, we must learn to cultivate mindfulness.Thoughts trigger feelings, and feelings usually initiate some form of action. So, to be sure you are acting from your higher self, try to focus your awareness on the present moment while acknowledging and accepting whatever feelings, thoughts, or bodily sensations that may arise. Once you become aware of the state of your mind, you can truly become the master creator of your life. \"Happiness is not something you postpone for the future; it is something you design for the present.\" - JIM ROHNI CHAPTER TWO How to Create Lasting Happiness think it's fair to say that happin ess is the goal for everyone on Earth. It doesn' t matter your age, where you live, what religion you practice, your gender , the color of your skin, or your cultural backgro und and upbringing. Happiness is the goal of all other goals, and everything we do is based on the desire to feel happy . Some people try to find happin ess in a romantic relationship. Others will try to find it in a job or establishing wealth and success. Some may think having better health, gaining material possessions, or working toward something in the future will make them happy , because the purpose of life for most is the expansion of happiness. All our decision s and actions are based on our desire to feel happy, and we do what we think will make us happy , even if it is unsupportive to our long-term happiness. As a child, my dream was to get married and have a family . I would cut out pictures of what my wedding dress would look like, and I would hold my dolls in my arms and fantas ize about them being my babies. From the age of seven, my idea of happiness was to have a family . As an adult, I saw romantic relationships as my golden ticket to happiness, and I spent my twenties and early thirties searching for happiness in a man. However , no relationship brought me the type of happiness that I had hoped for; in fact, they brought me quite the opposite.My life became a whirlwind of perpetual fleeting romances, and each time one ende d, I was left heartbroke n and miserable. It wasn' t until later in my thirties that I learned I couldn' t find true lasting happiness in any external thing. You see, I always knew that external things don't provide happiness, but it didn't change my longing and need for grasping at things outside myself to make me happy . We are all condi tioned to believe that relationships, money , jobs, perfect health, or life situations and achievements will make us happy . They are all impermanent, and while they may bring momentary satisfaction, they rarely bring lasting happiness. External things aren' t fixed, and there' s no guarantee that those things will last forever , so it makes sense to not place happiness on things that could eventually change. So, if we can't find happiness in external things, where does happiness come from? Ninety percent of long-term happiness is due to how the brain processes the world, and it does this throu gh filters, which ultimately determines our levels of happiness. Babies are born with an innate sense of happiness. They marvel at their world from a sense of wonder and delight, and when they feel unhappy , they express themselves in the moment. They have a natural way to be happy , but as we become older , we lose that childlike happiness because we think that romantic love, a bigger house, more money , or a better job will make us happy . These things can bring us happiness for a while, but there are alwa ys challenges that come with being in a relationship , owning a bigger house, or being the boss of a company , and most of the time those things require hard work, which inadvertently can create stress, tension, and disharmony .In our pursuit of happiness, we seek things that will bring us pleasure; however , pleasure is not the same as happiness. Seeking pleasure through sex, drugs, alcohol, shopping, or entertainment gives us momentary happiness, but things that give us personal pleasure won' t give us an overall feeling of fulfilment or a lasting sense of happiness because pleasure eventually wears of f.Once pleasure wears off, the vicious cycle of un-fulfilment is set. Like hamsters on a wheel, most of us perpetually seek unsustainab le forms of pleasure, unaware that it only provides transient happiness. Unhappiness is rooted in not knowing oneself. The truth is, we can all feel happy . Yes! Right here, right now. Happiness is a choice. And you deserve to be happy, even if it feels unfamiliar to you. Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and say to yourse lf ''I choose to feel happy right now, in this moment.' ' When you send clear instructions to your mind, you remove the blocks to happiness, and you can begin to feel happy . To connect to the source of bliss, which is a fundamental aspect of your higher self, to experience true happiness, you may need to make a few lifestyle adjustments. Below ar e 13 easy steps that will guide you toward lasting happiness: CREA TE A POSITIVE DAILY MORNING RITUAL To elevate your vibration to a higher level of love, peace, joy, and gratitude, create a daily morning ritual that sets the right tone for the rest of the day. This could be that you wake up and have a glass of lemon water or celery juice followed by writing in a journal, meditating, practicing yoga, or going for a walk. Whatever it might be, think of activities that nourish your soul. PRACTICE GRATITUDE Write down ten things that you are grateful for each day and allow gratitude to flow . SEND OUT LOVE ENERGY Send love energy to three people who are bothering you, then stay in stillness for five minutes and ask for guidance for the day ahead. SPEND TIME IN NATUREA study featured in the American Chemical Society Journal Envir onmental Science & Technology proves that being in nature can improve our mental health and wellbeing. When we sync the rhythms of our body to that of the natural rhythms of Mother Earth, we can experience a natural feeling of joy and connectedness to the source of bliss. EARTH YOURSELF Many people have lost their connection to the earth. We wear rubber shoes, we live in cities, and we spend the majority of our lives indoor s. The earth contains its own magnetic field, which has a mild negative char ge; however , our bodies build up a positive charge in modern-day life. To bring our body' s electrom agnetic charge back to a healthy state, we need to spend more time in direct contact with the earth. Skin to earth contact such as walking barefoot on the grass or along a beach, swimming in the ocean, covering yourself in mud, or gardening with your bare hands can all have a positive impact on your health and wellbeing. GET ENOUGH SLEEP According to the National Sleep Foundation, an average adult needs at least 7-9 hours of sleep a night. Anth ony William says your body does the most healing during the hours of 10 pm to 2 am, but you don't necessarily need to be sleeping; as long as you are in bed resting with your eyes closed, you will still reap the same healing benefits. A lack of sleep over time can cause sleep deprivatio n and exacerbate chronic health issues, so it's important to ensure you get adequate sleep. REDUCE STRESS Reducing external stressors, the type of stressors that require persistent hard work, which makes life a serious effort to live and interfere with your natural experience of happines s, so it's equally important to make your environment a positive place to be in. For example, most of us spend 70 percent of our waking hours at work, so it's important to work with people who are joyful, who complement your strengths, and with whom you share a bond and a similar vision. It's also important to ensure you have access tofresh air and natural light throughout your day, which both contribute to a sense of wellbeing. ELIMINA TE ALCOHOL , TOBACCO , DRUGS , JUNK FOOD , AND CHEMICALS Most people depend on having a glass or two of alcohol to relax at the end of the day or loosen up when engaging socially . We tend to gravitate toward fast foods for convenience. We clean our homes with toxic chemicals and lather our bodies in chemical-laden soaps, deodorants, moisturizers, and makeup. However , it's important to eliminate these unhealthy substances and reduce your exposure to chemicals. You might want to think strategically and start replacing the products you use the most with healthier alternatives. After all, what we put into and onto our bodies can directly impact the way we feel. PRACTICE MINDFULNESS It is important to become aware of our thoughts that endlessly ebb and flow from the mind and avoid engaging in negativity such as gossiping, dwelling on bad news, blaming others, or venting anger onto others. The moment we take responsibil ity for our own happiness is the moment we become free from the bonds of grasping at exterior sources that don't ultimately bring us happiness. CREA TE HAPPINESS FOR OTHERS The fastest way to manifest happiness for yourself is to create happiness for others. By being attentive, being a good listener , showing appreciation, being non-judgmental, acknowledging other 's strengths, sharin g love and affection, and showing that you care without trying to change another . Because you can only change yourself! DEVELOP MENT AL AND EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE Each day, try to increase your mental, emotional, and physical capacities by learning a new skill, watching a thought-provoking documentary , reading a book, developing self-awareness through attending a workshop, or gainingknowledge through experience. Instead of believing something that you read or watch on mainstream media, try to do your own research, trust in your intuition, and get in touch with your deeper self. DISCOVER YOUR SOUL 'S CALLING The happiest people are the ones who create meaning and purpose in their life. To do this, they are in touch with their authentic self, they follow a higher calling, and they carry out work that is both fulfilling and meaningful. In a deeper sense, it is a soul' s urge to express creativity and share one's unique gifts with the world. The moment we find the courage to follow our heart' s whisperings is the moment we can experience true freedom. AIM FOR THE HIGHEST FORM OF HAPPINESS The highest form of happiness is spiritual, devoid of the ego, and deeply rooted in the divine. Whatever life throws at you, try to enjoy the lifelong process of building a self, which contains infinite potential, possibilities, and love. Instead of focusing on building on external things such as wealth, try to build a self based on these qualities. It is the prospect of a fulfilled self that brings satisfaction and lasting happiness, even in the face of challenges, obstacles, setbacks, and adversities. Fulfilment come s from being in joy and peace, which is the type of happiness to aim for, not a temporary fix of pleasure. When we allow ourselves to be, when we allow ourselves to look at life through new eyes, from a place of compassion and non-judgment, we can experience the innate sense of happiness that we are all born with. HAPPINESS CAN'T BE LOST , NOR CAN IT BE GAINED. HAPPINESS IS ACCESSIBLE T O YOU HERE, RIGHT NOW , IN THIS VER Y MOMENT . YOU DON'T NEED T O W AIT FOR IT T O ARRIVE IN THE FUTURE, AND IF IT DIDN'T EXIST IN THE PAST, IT CAN EXIST RIGHT NOW IN THE PRESENT MOMENT . Close your eyes, take a deep breath, and invite joy and peace into your life. Try to nurture feelings that connect you with life, such as love, compassion, joy, and peace, and don't be afraid to let go of things in your life that don't contribute to your sense of happiness and wellb eing. What you might have thought would bring you happiness may be the very thing that is holding you back from experiencing it. I was so scared when I let go of my stable home life and fianc\u00e9 because I genuinely thought it would have brought me happiness. Yet, if I hadn' t taken that leap and let go, I may not be living to the fullest expression of my highest self and experiencing real happiness. Try to practice reflective think ing rather than dogmatic thinking. If happiness has been absent from your life for quite some time, don't be afraid to ask yourself questions rather than thinking negatively . You might be pleasantly surprised at the answers that arise from within, enabling you to take action. There is nothing more satisfying than being true to yourself and living your life according to your values and desires despite the naysayers. It is your life, and you're the only one who is living it! Establish yourse lf in being present while performing an action with love and grace. Thinking about the past or the future keeps us stuck, and it can create feelings of fear and anxiety. Remember , thoughts are powerful, and they can distort your reality and shape your experience of life, so rather than thinking, be an active participant in your life and do things that make you truly feel good. Remember , whatever you complain about in life will automatically create an unconscious intention to produce more of that which you are complaining about. The more you live in alignment with your true self, the more joy you will feel when moving toward your highest potential.Practicing happi ness now is the only way to do it, because if you are not happy now , how will you be happy in the future? Look around and see and feel all that exists. Acknowledge the miracle that is your life and all the life that surrounds you. It is a blessing to be alive. To be given this opportunity to have a human experience and to discover and carry out your soul' s purpose during this time in the cosmos. Be here now, be present, and experience others' presence, and you will naturally feel happy . \"Within all of us is a divine capacity to manifest and attract all that we need and desire.\" - WAYNE DYER.w CHAPTER THREE The Two Keys to Creating Powerful Affirmations e have all heard of affirmations, but they have somewhat gotten a bad reputation for being silly new-age nonsense over the years. So, let' s dive in and find out if they really are all nonsense! Affirmations can be a powerful tool to help create a change in mood or state of mind by affirming to the universe your intention of what you would like to manifest. They can rewire our brains by forming new clusters of positive thought, bringing about an increased level of feel-good hormones, and they may help break harmful patterns of thought and speech, which can lead to negative actions. However , it is how we carry them out that determines their ef fectiveness. If you believe the phrase; \"You are what you think,\" then life indeed stems from your thoughts. We need to ensure that what we are thinking correlates to what we truly want to manifest in life, and one way to do this is through af firmations.WHEN WE VERBALL Y AFFIRM OUR DREAMS, GOALS, AND DESIRES, WE INST ANTL Y EMPOWER OURSEL VES WITH A DEEP SENSE OF REASSURANCE THA T WHA T WE ARE SA YING WILL BECOME A REALITY , AND WE ALIGN OURSEL VES T O THE SAME POSITIVE FREQUENCIES OF WHA T WE ARE TRYING T O ATTRACT . It's not about wishing for something and hoping that it will come true, because if in your subconscious mind you don't believe what you are affirming or trying to manifest, it won' t happen. Your subconscious is like a vast, unlimited memory bank, and it permanently stores everything that has ever happened to you. Its primary function is to store and retrieve data, and it makes sure you respond precisely the way you are programmed to. It ensures that everything you say and do fits with your concept of self. It is in a constant state of mental homeostasis by keeping you thinking and acting in familiar ways. Your habitual ways of thinking and acting get stored, and it memorizes all of your comfort zones. More often than not, when we try to do something new, the subconscious mind makes us feel emotionally uncomfortable because its primary job is to keep us within our comfort zones. When I started my first business, I felt extremely anxious, fearful, and uncomfortable taking clients' money . I had never run a business before, nor had I ever received money for the services I offered. I was completely outside my comfort zone, and everything about it felt foreign to me. My brain told me this is dangerous because I was in uncharted wate rs, however , I had to push through the discomfort because I knew that what I was doing was what I wanted deep down.It's natural to feel fear when you start something new because your brain is hardwired to always return to what is familiar . The trick is to develop mental habits that support what you truly want in life. So, how do we develop new mental habits and override those negative beliefs that hold us back in life? Affirmations can create new habits of thinking, which purposefully instill new comfort zones from which your subconscious mind will adapt. The main goal of affirmations is to transfer messages from the conscious mind to the subconscious mind , which is the part that holds 90 percent of your total mind, making it the lar gest most profound influence over whatever you wish to attract into your life. The beauty of the subconscious mind is that it never questions your instructions, so whatever you say goes. It always obeys the commands that are directed by your conscious mind. Your subconscious mind works tirelessly to make your behavior fit a pattern that is consistent with your feelings associated with your thoughts, hopes, and desir es. It does not distinguish between good or bad, helpful or non-helpful, positive or negative. It will grow either weeds or flowers in the garden of your life, and your state of mind will ultimately determine the result. Our conscious mind intercepts, analyses, and usually rejects everything that we direct toward the subconscious mind. It is resistant to change, so when we carry out affirmations , we must ensure they get delivered to the correct part of the mind. The challenge is to bypass the conscious mind, the part that you use to interact with the physical world every day, which makes up only 10 percent of your mind, and imprint the subconscious mind with an affirmation that is specific and meaningful to you. However , it is no use throwing out an affirmation and expecting what you want to magically appear without being willing and motivated to carry out the necessary tasks that will put you into alignment with what you want to manifest. A groundbreak ing study published in the April 2010 issue of Psychological Science journal suggested that asking ourselves questions can increase our intrinsic motivation to complete a goal. Askin g questions creates an intern al motivation toward action and using interrogative self-talkas opposed to declarative self-talk can increase our chances of success toward the desired outcome. Declarative self-talk is when we make statements about ourselves which can either be positive (e.g., affirmations) or negative (e.g., core beliefs). Interrogative self-talk is about asking questions. During the study , researchers found that subjects who were asking themselves questions were more likely to achieve their desired outcome because interrogative self-talk activates curiosity , which leads to finding answers and creative solutions toward achieving goals. Let's say you are about to give a public talk and you're feeling nervous. You may find yourself declaring \"I'm terrible at public speak ing; it never goes well for me.\" Or you may give yourself a positive pep talk such as \"I will deliver a great speech that inspires my audience.\" Both are declarative statements which can create inner tension and conflict because what you are trying to affirm is incongruent with a deeply held belief in the unconscious mind. However , when we adjust the above statements to questions such as: \"Am I terrible at public speaking?\" \"Have they ever gone well for me?\" or \"Will I deliver a great speech that inspires my audience?\" it automatically creates an internal dialogue where you can draw upon inner resources and strength, which can help you create the desired outcome rather than fooling your mind into believing something that doesn' t feel true, which creates cognitive dissonance. Using this technique before carrying out any task that you feel anxious about is particularly useful. It can also be a powerful tool to use when combined with affirmations. It acknowledges your negative thoughts and feelings and reduces any internal friction that often arises when you say something that your mind does not believe to be true. Additionally , when working with the subconscious mind, it is best to communicate with it through feelings because your subconscious does not associate with words. So, when saying your affirmation, try to visualize how it would feel if what you were saying came true.FOLLOW THESE FIVE STEPS T O SUCCESSFULL Y MANIFEST WHA T YOU TRUL Y DESIRE USING THE POWER OF SELF- INQUIR Y, AFFIRMA TIONS, AND VISUALIZA TION: Visualize in your mind what you would like to manifest and draw your awareness to any negative self-beliefs or internal statements. Listen carefully as they can be subtle. Once you recognize a negative belief, turn the statements into questions, e.g., I am into Am I . Reflect on your answers to those questions. Acknowledge any feelings that may arise while using your breath to release any accumulated ener gy that may have been stored in your body . Begin your affirmation and try to visualize how it would feel if it were to come true. Visualize every detail. The more specific the better and allow yourself to be enveloped by the feeling. When affirmations are repeated daily for at least 21 days, they send information to your subconscio us. This is the real power of affirmations. When done correctly , they can reprogram your mind into believing the statement.Doing this exercise puts you energetically in tune with the higher vibrations of the universe where the magic of manifestation and the real law of attraction happens. Guidelines: Follow the five steps above and speak the affirmation out loud for five minutes three times a day, preferably just before sleep and just after waking when the conscious mind is less active. Continue for at least 21 days or before any task that you feel nervous or anxious about. To creat e your own personalize d affirmation; connect with your higher self and ask for the right statement which will serve your highest good. Keeping your affirmations to a short sentence that uses I statements in the present tense is best. \"You are one thing only. You are a Divine Being. An all-powerful Creator. You are a Deity in jeans and a t-shirt, and within you dwells the infinite wisdom of the ages and the sacred creative force of All that is, will be, and ever was.\" - - ANTHON ST . MAAR TENt CHAPTER FOUR how to manifest using the real law of attraction his chapter has slowly manifested over a five-year period, and the content has arisen from what I have learned from one of my most inspiring teachers, Deepak Chopra. The one thing that stood out to me the most during my quest to learn about manifestat ion and the law of attraction was hearing these words: \"The power of intention is the real law of attraction because intention is a modified form of consciousness , and the most powerful form of intentions are ones that are subtle and totally un-manifested.\" Chopra sure had a way of delivering wisdom that reverberated through my entire being, causing aha moments! His words made total sense to me. I started writing my blog Memoirs of a Gypsy , not knowing then that some of the content would help me write this book. I started writing my blog seven years ago with no real plan except with the intention to document what I had learned and experie nced. Seven years later, it has manifested into a book, then I created The Total Transformation Method , which helps people all over the world overcome chronic health problems naturally so they too can live a happy , healthy , and symptom free life. You see, when we align ourselves to the source of universal consciousness, we can become vessels for the natural energy ofmanifestation, which ultimately brings forth everything for our highest good. For example, by moving out of my house, giving away all of my possessions, and living alone in my campervan, I created the right environment and enough space to align myself to the higher vibrations of the universe. From this space, the energy of universal consciousness manifested everything through me that was ultimately for my highest good. I soon found myself graduating as a yoga teacher in India, manifesting money , and travelling the world. Intention begins at the level of consciousness; then it moves from a subtle level to thoughts, speech, and finally , action. We are vessels for the spark of divine consciousness whic h moves through us, and it ultimately manifests in what we do in our lives. When we go to bed at night with the intention to sleep, it is a non-verbal intention becaus e the intention to sleep activates its own fulfilment in our biology . Just like how intention is a modified form of consciousness, we as human beings are modified forms of consciousness that encompass sensations, feelings, images, and thoughts. We have two parts to our nervous system, autonomic and volun tary. The autonomic nervous system keeps us alive and healthy by regulating our blood pressure and immune system and organizing self-regulation of homeostasis. It is also regulate d by intention at a subtle level. That level comes from consciousness; spiritual traditions call it the soul. It activates your autonomic nervous system , the involuntary part, to keep you alive in self-regulation. The next form of subtle intenti on is when we are aware of talking and walking but we don't verbalize it. This is the voluntary nervous system, which lies at the cusp before manifestation.The next level of intention is at the level of thought. You have a thought in your mind; for example, \"I need to call my mother tomorrow because it'sher birth day,\" so your intention becomes a thought, which has come into manifest awareness as a thought-form. The final form of intention is in the form of speech. For example, you may ask your partner to remind you to phone your mother tomo rrow, which may manifest into action. Understanding the different layers of intention enabled me to trust and let go. I was reminded of this time and time again, and \"I let go and trust in the universe\" became my new mantra. When things did not work out the way I had planned, which often happened when I made decisions based on ego, something more aligned with my higher self-took its place. I moved to Australia with the intention to rent a house, yet when I arrived there were setbacks after setbacks, and rather than clinging on to the intention that I had made in the past, I surrendered to the feeling of not knowing. Suddenly , a new path was laid out before me without having to do anything, and in a matter of weeks, my partner and I purchased a motorhome, which required little to no ef fort. Our mind, body , and experiences of the world are forms of consciousness. If your mind, body , and experiences were anything other than consciousness, you would have to ask how something unmanifest, such as your autonomic nervous system, orchestrates fulfilment in the manifest? Consciousness, mind, and body are all forms of one non-dual reality , which is conscio usness. As human beings, we have a physical body that is autonomous and a spiritual body that is a part of consciousness. That consciousness holds infinite possibilities, synchronicities, creativity , and it can create inten tion that orchestrates its own fulfilment. So, how do we use intention, which is the real law of attraction, to manifest what we truly want in life? Although it may feel uncomfortable, the best way to facilitate intention is to dwell in the realm of uncertainty and ask your higher self, which is connected to universal consciousness, for guidance. Consciousness will not move through you to help you manifest what you desire if what you are asking for is disconnected from your higher self and your intention comes from ego.IF YOU CONNECT WITH YOUR HIGHER SELF AND ASK FOR GUIDANCE, THE RIGHT INTENTION WILL AUT OMA TICALL Y APPEAR IN THE FORM OF AN INSIGHT , EPIPHANY , SITUA TION, OR IN A RELA TIONSHIP THA T GUIDES YOU. When I searched for a yoga teacher training course, I was fraught with anxiety because I was scared of choosing the wrong one. I worried that the teachers weren' t going to be qualified enough, the course wouldn' t be authentic enough, the training was going to be too hard, and I feared failing. After months of searching, I finally offered up my fears, worries, and anxieties to the universe, and I asked for guidance. In a matter of days, I booked into a yoga teacher training course in India, which turned out to be the best course for my highest good, because one year later I was offered a scholarship worth over $1800, and six months of work within the yoga village. That experience also gave me valuable insights into the type of yoga teacher that I wanted to be. So, instead of saying what you want, for example, \"I want a loving relationship,\" \"I want a beautiful house,\" or \"I want a new car,\" ask for guidance from your higher self and ask questions such as: \"What is my purpose?\" \"Wha t do I need in my life right now?\" \"What is the best choice for me to make in this moment to fulfil what I want at the deepest level of my soul?\" and \"How will the fulfilment of my intentions result in the evolution of my being?\" Asking questions instead of making statements allows for openness and vulnerability , and it is within that stillness that divine consc iousness can orchestrate the details. The deeper you go, the more powerful the intention becomes, because when you surrender to the uncertainty that resides in the field of pureconsciousness, it allows you to manifest intention through the creative power of the universe . Without uncertainty , there cannot be any creativity; uncertainty is where the divine moves through you to create new relationships, new meanings, and a new life story . When I moved out of my house, I had no idea what I wanted to manifest. I was living entirely in the realm of uncertainty , and as paradoxi cal as it may seem, it was in the space of not knowing that things became clear . Certain situations started to unfold, new relationships formed, old relationships dropped away , and I started living an entirely new life which was in alignment with my true self. Some people make specific plans, or they have ambitions based on desires of their ego, and through hard work, they become stressed out or physically ill, and even if the intention does work out, they have created so much stress that they are not able to enjoy the fruits of their labor . Trust your innermost being. The highest form of intuition is so subtle that when we surrender to the wisdom of the universe, we become a channel for choice-less awareness and the highest levels of fulfilment that align the elements, and forces within you are within the elements and forces of the universe. The fundamenta l reality is that you and the cosmos are one. We are patterns of activity in a universe of non-duality where consciousness, mind, emotions, thoug hts, body , and the universe are all modified forms of the same pure consciousness in the form of experience. All experience is ultimately our perceptions of images, feelings, and thoughts. The universe does not function linearly; it functions all at once. It is an ever-present continuation of the now. Although we think of the universe as material, there is no actual physical substance. It is all sense experiences that we interpret as matter . Matter is the interpretation of sensory experiences such as sound, taste, smell, texture, color , and form. We are essentially formless beings that express itself as form, and we do this through intention. Exer cise: We form most of our negative, self-limiting beliefs during the first few years of life, which can deeply impact how we feel about ourse lves and the world around us. It can also block our ability to connect with our higher self, which is deeply rooted in the divine. This simple NLP (Neuro-Linguistic Programming) exercise will help you discover your three biggest blocks to abundance so you can gain more clarity about what you truly want in life. You will learn how to remove those blocks that are holding you back and access the universal flow of infinite possibilities. Write down what your perfect body would look like, including how you would feel. For example, my skin is clear and glowing, my hair long and lustrous, and I feel vibrant and healthy . Write down your ideal love relationship, what would they look like, what you would be doing together , and how you feel being with them. For example, my perfect partner is tall with an athletic build, we share a similar life vision, we carry out meaningful work together , and I feel loved and happy when I am with him/her . Write down what wealth and financial abundance would look like to you; the more specif ic, the better . Include how much money you would like to receive each month and the things you would do with the money . Write down what you would give back to the world, what would it look like, and how would it feel to do this?Write down what your big dreams are. If there were no limitations to what you could manifest, what would you be doing, what would you create, what would it look like, and how would you feel doing it? Be clear and specific! Removing Y our Abundance Blocks: This step reveals any limiting beliefs that may be stopping you from having what you want in life. Remember how you felt when you wrote down what you wanted in each of the five steps. Choose three areas that stood out to you the most for having the least clarity and the most inner conflict or resistance. For example, how did you feel when you decided on the amount of money you wanted to receiv e each month? Did you feel any blocks, resistan ce, doubt, or unworthiness? Did you hear a voice that said that's unrealistic or there' s no way I can achieve that? In respo nse to what you wrote in step 6, write down, I allow myself to followed by a positive affirmatio n that correlates to your limitin g belief. For example, I allow myself to experience financial abundance . Choose three things that you are guaranteed to do each consis tently . It could be brushing your teeth, turning on the light, or using the toilet. Write down one of the three things that you have decided to do, using the words I allow myself to before the action, on three individual post-it notes, followed by one of your three affirmations, then post the notes on the three places where you will go to carry out these tasks. Stating a fact that you know to be true using things that you repetitively do each day, doing the stated fact and then adding in your positive affirmation can fool your subconscious mind into believing the affirmationto be true. Doing this automatically places you in tune with the vibration that you would like to manifest. IT IS IMPOR TANT T O CARR Y OUT STEP 8 IN THIS EXACT ORDER: 1. You will automatically go to do what you do every day without thinking, so strategically place your post-it note on a place where you can easily see it. For example, on the light switch, next to the toilet, or above the bathroom sink. 2. Carry out your stated fact. 3. Then say your af firmation. Ultimately , the best way to tap into abundance is to start giving , even if you feel like you have nothing to give. You could simply give a smile or say hello to a rando m stranger . Ask and give to receive is the universal order . You cannot have an idea of what you want without putting forth the energy you are trying to attract and expect it to work. Many people have a difficult time creating abundance in their lives because deep down they feel not enough. If this resonates with you, tell yourself every day, ''I am enough.' ' Write it on your mirror and put it on your screen saver on your phone to remind you. On the other hand, notfeeling enough can also have the opposite effect. Some people may overcompensate for the lack they feel within by trying to create abundance on the exterior . Whatever side you sit in, ensure your motivation to create abundance is genuine and not coming from an unmet emotional need. The universe works to support our highest self, not our ego' s needs. \"This life that has been given to us is a gift, such a precious gift. To really try to understand it, really try to recognize it, is the greatest meditation. Through the media of this knowledge, we can tap into our inner sources that are so beautiful.\" - PREM RA WAT.I CHAPTER FIVE The Gifts of Meditation f you have read the previous chapters, you might anticipate what I am going to say next. After all, repetition is the best way to learn! Our subconscious mind is largely responsible for what we manifest in life and the levels of happiness that we experience. So, to create what we truly desir e, we must become aware of our mind' s inner workings, and one way to do this is through meditation. From the age of four, I can remember watching my parents meditate, and being an inquisitive child who wanted to copy everything they did, I often joined in. Being exposed to meditation at such a young age enabled me to forge through life with an inner know ing which often comes much later in life. I consider myself fortunate to have learned how to meditate at such a young age, and I strongly believe that being exposed to the various practices has helped shape who I am today . The meditations my parents practiced varied. Some involved sitting in a dark room and observing a candle's flame, and others involved sitting in silence, breathing, dancing, crying, yelling, shaking, and chanting. All the different techniques had the same goal: to release trauma and become conscio us and aware in the present moment. Because whatever is left in the uncon scious remains, waiting for an opportunity to be expressed, accepted, and resolved.Instead of expressing trauma unconsciously in life, which can impact your relationship s, health, and happiness, meditation allows a safe space to explore, discove r, accept, and release what is holding you back. Imagine how much our world would change if everyone meditated! What is Meditation? Meditation is a primary tool for personal development and spiritual growth. It can provide the missing link which takes you from living life unconsciously to being a consc ious participant in life as it unfolds, and it can bring healing to your soul. According to Osho, there are over one hundred methods of meditation, which all hold a common theme: to transform the mind to realize consciousness. To meditate simply means to observe the content of your mind from a place of non-judgment without becoming identified with the content. As soon as you judge a thought, you become identified with it, and so you lose being in a state of meditation. To meditate means to become a silent observer , a witness to an ever-flowing wave of thoughts which come and go continuously from your mind. Some people think meditation is to stop thinking, but that is almost impossible! Don' t feel like you have failed because you have been unable to switch your mind off. The truth is, your thoughts will always be there , but if you can learn to recognize them, they will no longer be the driving force behind your words and actions. You will then live from a space of consciousness rooted in the here and now instead of reacting unconscious ly from an imprint of the past. When you are free from your mind, you are free from past trauma and conditioning, and you are free to start living from a space of authenticity , which is deeply connected to source consciousness. To know oneself means to know all that is worth knowing; it is to understand the inner workings of the cosmos. You cannot get freedom without awareness. You might think that you have arrived at a place offreedom, but your subconscious will always be in the background, pulling strings and dominating the outcome of your life experience. It is easy to get caught up in labels and forget who we are. People declare \"I am a mother\" or \"I am a father ,\" \"I am a doctor ,\" \"I am a lawyer ,\" \"I am a painter ,\" but those labels are not who we truly are. If you stripped away all the labels, what would you be left with? Who are you? When we run an errand, we usually encounter a person who provides us with a service. They almost always say, \"Hello, how are you today?\" And we automaticall y reply with \"I am good, thank-you,\" even if we feel terrible. All too often, we respond on autopilot, which leaves no room for any real interpersonal exchange or authenticity . In modern-day life, people are often busy working, studying, or caring for children, and we rarely get the time to reflect on and disco ver who we truly are. As a result, we live our lives on autopilot, and we don't even realize it. IF OUR RELA TIONSHIP WITHIN LACKS DEPTH, OUR RELA TIONSHIPS WITH OTHERS WILL LACK DEPTH, AND LIFE WILL BECOME SHALLOW . WHEN WE DRA W OUR AWARENESS INW ARD AND GET REAL WITH OURSEL VES, WE CAN BE REAL WITH OTHERS. LIFE THEN BECOMES MORE FULFILLING. Meditation is a powerful tool that helps bring you closer to knowing yourself, and it can bring about feelings of deep peace, harmony , and joy. It is a practice that enables you to focus your attention inward, bringing youinto an internal space of clear awareness so that you can be rooted in the present. It is a way to focus your mind on paying attention to what is happening deep inside you, allowing you to connect to your highe r self and consciousness, bringing deep feelings of love and joy. It can release long- held traumas and promote emotional healing. It can also balance your chakras, the energy centers of your soul and the portal that connects your energy to all that resides within consciousness. Besides providing the tools to knowing yourself and increasing that feel-good feeling, the most significant gift that meditation brings is higher levels of consciousness and peace, which raises the vibration of all on planet Earth. When you meditate, you not only experience the benefits for yourself, but you directly impact those around you, and you contribut e to raising collective consciousness. Meditation can be practiced by anyone, with no need to be part of any religion. Scientific studies that prove the benefits of meditation for health, and especially the brain, show that secular meditation is suitable for all. With so many different methods available, try to choose one that suits you. Suppose you have a lot of energy and you are very physically active. In that case, you might struggle to sit still for any length of time, so an active meditation might be more suitable, or if you are very mentally active, you might find reciting a mantra more helpful rather than sitting in silence. Find what medit ation style works for you and begin with a few minutes each day , gradually increasing the length of time. With practice, you will eventually notice fewer thoughts coming and going, and you will begin to find that gap between your thoug hts and the silence, where everything suddenly stands still. In time, that gap lengthens, which allows you to move more easily into that space. Some people can live continuously from that gap. Those people are called enlightened or awakened. Clearing Y our Space to Pr epar e for MeditationThe energy surrounding you can affect how you feel and how effectively you can meditate, so it is important to take control of your space by ensuring only the type of ener gies you want to live in are present. Traditional meth ods of clearing the space such as smudging and burning herbs like sage have been used for centuries. However , I learned a powerful visualization from my spiritual teacher Deborah King that requires nothing other than your mind. Sit comfortably within the space you want to clear . Close your eyes and take a few slow, deep breaths. Now , beneath your feet, picture a white sheet as big as the entire space you are sitting in. Using your energy, concentrated focus, and breath, start raising the white sheet off the floor . As it rises, you will notice that it goes right through you. You are using your intentionality to raise all of the dark energy that is in your space, and even within yourself, anythin g depressive, heavy , anxious, negative, or sad. Using your breath, continue raising the white sheet. It is like a giant parach ute, floating up through you and ultimately rising above you. Watch it as it continues to float up. Give it an extra little push and send it up above the ceiling, up above the roof, and right into the sky . And away it goes! Your space will feel lighter and look a little brighter . Outer and Inner Distractions If you meditate at home, your family members need to know not to disturb you. Put a do not disturb sign on your door, silence your phone, turn off anything that emits electrom agnetic energy, and make sure there are no pets in the room with you, as they will take all the energy you generate during your practice. Inner distractions are your thoughts. The thought of \"I'm making a mistake\" or \"I'm not doing this right\" is simply another thought. Once you become aware of the thought, try to return your focus to your mantra or breath. If you find that you fall asleep while meditating, that's fine too. Your body might need the rest. There will also be times when you release so much stress that you will have to lie down to clear your nervou s system. It is all okay. Whe n you wake up, whether it is after five minutes or a wholehour, you can then resume meditating for five or ten minutes before moving. Mantra Meditation Mantra meditation is a powerful seed syllable, word, or phrase that is internally heard while meditating. As you hear it inside your head, it creates a vibration that connects you to divine consciousness. It expands your energy field, so you can enter into deeper levels of awareness and eventually into the field of pure consciousness. Reciting a mantra makes it possi ble for you to slip through a gap, a tiny- microscopic space between your thoughts, and enter a vast field of pure consciousness, silence, and peace. Concentrating on a mantra can be particularly helpful for those with overactive minds. If you want to give it a go, you might want to begin with the mantra AUM , repeating it silently in your head without moving your lips. AUM is the sound of the univer se, and when chanted, it vibrates at the same frequency that is found throughout all of nature. When you chant it, you are physica lly tuning in to that vibration. The vibration also helps to calm the nervous system and mind. After meditating , it can be useful to write down any thoughts, feelings, or sensa tions that arise. Journaling will give you time to reflect on your experience and become aware of any resurfacing themes that may need to be addressed in therapy . Medical Medium Meditations Anthony William says when we go through trauma, our soul, which resides in the head, leaves in an attempt to avoid injury . When we experience shock and trauma, it triggers the adrenals to relea se a potent hormone blend, which can short circuit neurotransmitters and lead to subtle brain inflammat ion, particularly in the presence of heavy metals, which oxidize in a high fat environment. In an ideal world, we would all have fully intact souls, however it is virtually impossible to avoid some form oftrauma, after all; we are only human! And through the course of our life, our soul can become fractured. YOUR SOUL, SPIRIT , AND HEAR T ARE DISTINCT P ARTS OF YOU THA T ARE ALL CONNECTED. YOUR HEAR T SER VES AS A COMP ASS FOR YOUR ACTIONS, AND IT IS ALSO A SAFETY NET FOR WHEN YOUR SOUL BECOMES INJURED, AND YOUR SPIRIT IS YOUR WILL AND STRENGTH. If you feel you need to work on healing your soul, another good option if you are new to meditating is to try a Medical Medium meditat ion such as: Watching or envisioning waves on the beach, being in nature and calling upon the Angel of Trees to ground yourself, bird watching, bee watching, collecting stones, sunbathing, picking fruit, watching your garden grow , expressing creativity , watching the moon, watching sunsets and star gazing, which can help heal fractures in your soul. For a deeper explanation on each meditation, please pick up a copy of Medical Medium: Secrets Behind Chronic and Mystery Illness and How to Finally Heal (Revised and Expanded Edition). A SIMPLE MEDIT ATION TECHNIQUE THA T CAN OPEN YOU UP TO LIMITLESS POSSIBILITIES AND UNIVERSAL ABUNDANCE: Sit quietly in a comfortable position away from any potential distractions and close your eyes. Begin to focus on the ebb and flow of your breath. When you have arrived at a still and quiet space within, ask for guidance, then let go of any outcome or ideas. Go deeper into meditation and silence, allow yourself to receive insights from your higher self and guidance from divine consciousness in the forms of synchronicities, epiphanies, insights, intuition, situations, events, or relationships, which orchestrate the fulfilment of your highest good. Observing the content of your mind, asking for guidance, surre ndering to what is, and letting go of any need for control strengthens your intuition and allows the flow of spontaneous universal energy to flow in the direction of your highest good. The key is to develop trust in the univers e and allow yourself to receive guidance from the cosmos, which heightens your intuition, thus enabling you to make the right choices in the right moment and for the right purpose. The gifts of meditation are far-reaching. Even a few minutes a day can bring about a profound change in the way you think, feel, and experience life. It is the starting point for self-discovery and spiritual development, and it promotes feelings of inner harmony and joy . People often set aside time for their meditation practice; however , it doesn' t need to be something you do. When you become familiar with the empty space between your thoughts and begin to live more consciously , your meditation practice becom es a way of being, and everything you do becomes a meditation. \"Yoga is the settling of the mind into silence. When the mind has settled, we are established in our essential nature, which is unbounded consciousness. Our essential nature is usually overshadowed by the activity of the mind.\" - PATANJALI.I CHAPTER SIX the Eight Limbs Of Yoga f meditation is not your thing, another powerful tool for perso nal and spiritual development is the practice of yoga. The popularity of yoga has exploded over the years, and most people associate yoga with physical postures. Western-based classes focus mainly on yoga' s physical aspects, however; there is a lot more to yoga than most of us realize. What is the true essence of yoga? Is it fast becoming lost to a multi- billion dollar-fitness industry , which is largely based on getting a toned body , looking good in the latest fitness gear, and posting the best-looking pictures on Instagram? Let's dive in and explore the answers to those questions! The goal of all traditional yoga paths is to experience the truth of oneself in connection to the cosmos. This is called self-realization or samadhi. Traditionally , a yoga posture was held for an extended period of time so that the yogi would forget the body and the mind. Doing this would help facilitate meditation to experien ce the truth of oneself. These postures were often simple. For example, yogis would hold lotus pose (cross-legged seated position) for extended periods of time during meditation. Yogis also practiced yoga postures or asanas to improve the body' s health so that there were no distractions in the mind when sitting tomeditate. With a peaceful mind comes the ability to meditate; therefore, the true purpose of yoga asana is to facilitate meditation. However , nowadays, it seems the more extreme an asana is, the more the yoga practitioner is hailed as an advanced yogi, which is far from the truth in a traditional sense. Many modern yoga styles have arisen from students of the great yoga guru Sri Tirumalai Krishnamac harya, who tried to save traditional yoga from oblivion. Students of Krishnamacharya, including Sri Krishnamacharya) created their own styles of yoga, which we now know as Ashtanga, Iyengar , and V ini Y oga. These modern forms of yoga are what is now being taught and practiced throughout the world. To understand what has happen ed to traditional yoga, my passion for learning the deeper aspects led me to the Himalaya' s in Nepal. It was there that I met a yogi who completely shattered everything that I'd learned in yoga teacher training schools. Unlike the big names and popular social media yoga teachers in the west, Premanan da didn' t have a Facebook or Instagram account, and he didn' t advertise himself. Only by chance, when driving down a narrow dirt road, did I notic e a little sign outside the front of his house adve rtising yoga classes. I didn't quite know what to expect when I attended my first class with him. All I knew was he had trained at The Bihar School of Yoga (the world' s first yoga university), he taught one-on-one, and his classes were based on Swami Satyananda Saraswati' s teachings. He welcomed me into his mode st little home with a warm \"namaste,\" and I sat down on a cushion on the floor . There were no mirrors, props, or music playing, just a bare room with paint peeling off the walls in a basic house perfumed with the smell of incense. In his forties, he dressed in loose yellow clothing, and, like most Nepalis, he was short. The class immediately began with a long philosophical talk about yoga. He explained that he believed yoga is the practice of non-ego and in a class full of students, it's easy to compare yourself and compete with others, which is why he only taught one-on-one.He explained that yoga could be practiced anywhere at any time and during any activity that one carries out through the art of mindfulness. This idea was totally foreign to me, and I felt so na\u00efve to have thought that yoga postures were the all-important element in yoga, when yoga postures are one of many yogic practices that can lead one to internal bliss. A light suddenly switched on inside me while the profoundness of what he was saying sunk slowly in. This means we could practice yoga while washing the dishes, going for a walk, cooking dinner , or anything that we are doing or not doing. Perhaps it is more yogic-like to be watching television within a complete state of awareness rather than carrying out a sequence of yoga poses in a crowded studio with no awareness whatsoever! After having an in-depth discussion about yoga philosophy , he took me through a series of postures to warm up my body before starting the asanas. I was so used to jumping right into sun salutations before practicing a rigorous form of sweat-inducing Ashtanga, and I wondered how slowly and repetitively rotating and flexing certain body parts would be of any benefit to me. As if he could read my mind, his softly spoken voice pointed out the numerous benefits of bringing total mind-body awareness through specific movements designed to warm up my joints and remove blockages in my pranic flow . He explained that illness and disease often result from energetic blockages, and through these simple exercises, one can attain a healthy life. So, I continued with my eyes closed as he guided me into my first posture using only his voice. I thought the pose was too easy for me because I was used to doing advanced postures and handstands. However , he continued guiding me into the simplest of postures as he could see I was attached to my ego, and I wasn' t yet ready to move onto the more advanced postures. He studied the rhythm and flow of my breath and gave me gentle reminders as I worked slowly and consistently through each posture while maintaining complete awarenes s. For the first time, I felt that I was going deep into a meditative state, far from a yoga studio' s bright lights and the often-quick pace of an asana-based led class.I went on to practice pranayama, and then he led me into Yoga Nidra (a deep psychic sleep) where every muscle in my body felt completely relaxed. My mind drifted into oblivion, but I was fully awake, and all my fears, worries, and insecurities disappeared until I was left with nothing but nothingness\u2014a state of peace with the universal source of life itself. After three years of practicing what I thought was yoga, I felt like I was finally beginning to grasp what the essence of yoga really is, far from the watered-down versions that are so often taught in western classe s and over- priced teacher training schools. Just like the old proverb; \"When a student is ready , a teacher will appear .\" I had found my teacher , and I felt thankful that I had unintentionally stumbled across him. I had been given an invaluable lesson, which cost me a fractio n of the price of a western yoga class, and I learned more than I had in all the yoga classes that I had ever taken! Feeling humbled, I left my ego at the door that day and went back to the very basics of yoga. As a yoga teacher , I had felt like a fraud. I had been yearning to learn and experience for myself the deeper aspects of yoga, and now I was fully able to pass down what I had learned to my students and offer them a well- rounded class, without feeling like nothing more than a fitness instructor . There are many different yoga paths, which all have the same goal of awakening our consciousness. Choosing a yoga path is indeed a personal choice which can entirely depe nd on one's personality as to what would best suit. There is no one size fits all approach. Each style has its unique benefits; however , this chapter will be based on providing an in-depth understanding of yoga' s philosophical background, focusing on Patanjali' s eight limbs, also known as Raja or Ashtanga Y oga. Yoga in Sanskrit signifies the union of any form of connection, so it can mean the conscious connection with self in a philosophical sense. According to the Upanishads' sacred Hindu texts, yoga was divided into four form s: Raja, Hatha, Mantra, and Laya. Then it later branched out into eight schools: Bhakti (the path of love through devotion), Jnana (the path of knowledge and wisdom), Karm a (the path of service through action), Raja (the path of meditation), Tantra (the path of personal experience and ritual), Hatha (the path of physical postures), Kundalini (the path of awakening kundalini and uniting Shiva and Shakti) and Mantra (the path of sound).All these yoga paths are interchangeable with each other and lead to the same goal: enlightenment. Raja Yoga's eight-fold path, which is also considered to encompass Hatha, Jnana, Bhakti, and Karm a Yoga, aims to harmonize oneself to attain samadhi or union with the divine, which leads to self-realization. The first five precepts are orientated toward removing external distractions, while the final three focus on raising one's consc iousness so that the mind ceases to function. If we look at the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali, the foundational text of yoga, we can see a clear path laid out for yoga practitioners to achieve kaivalya , Raja Y oga's ultimate goal, and liberation from rebirth. While it may not be the goal of most people to achieve this level of consciousness, it is worth understanding these ancient texts if we wish to achieve a well-rounded and balanced yoga practice. So, if you are thinking about taking up yoga or if you have already been practicing, understanding the philosophy behind the postures will enable you to go deeper into your practice. Let's now look more closely at the eight limbs of Patanjali' s yoga system. Within the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali are the yamas\u2014the first limb of Raja Yoga. The yamas are the moral disciplines for the practicing yogi, and the five precepts attempt to harmonize oneself with our external world. Ahimsa is the absence of violence from one's mind, body , and spirit. It means the total cessati on of violent thoughts, words, and actions toward all living beings, including animals. It is the realization that the spark of divine spiritual energy exists in all forms of life, and to hurt another being is to hurt oneself. This precept gives many yogis a fundamental reason to maintain a vegetarian diet. Satya means the practice of truthfulness, and it pertains to the virtuous restraint from falsehoo d and distortion of reality in one's words, expressions, and actions. It mean s to think, speak, and act with integrity and truthfulness. Asteya means one must not steal in action, speech, or thought. Not only does it mean not to steal property , but it can also pertain to being on time and speaking mindfully so as not to steal another 's time away , or it could mean not stealing someone else' s peace during a yoga class. Brahmacharya can be interpreted in various ways. The classical text refers to maintaining a virtuous lifestyle of celibacy or fidelity if one is married. However , in modern-d ay times, it is recognized as not wasting one's energy on things that don't serve a higher purpose, such as misusing our sexual ener gy. Aparigraha pertains to non-greed, non-poss essiveness, and non- attachment. It means to live without greed from material gain or happiness by killing, hurting, or destroying other human beings, life forms, or nature. Next comes the niyamas: self-restraint disciplines and internal observances to harmonize oneself with our feelings. Sauca means to maintain the purity of body and mind through cleanliness. The outer aspect pertains to keeping ourselves clean and our lives organized and uncluttered . The inner aspect guides us to a healthy body and clarity of mind through the practice of asanas and pranayama. Santosha is a feeling of inner contentment. It means to be happy with what we have rather than focusing on what we don' t have in life. Tapas represents the burning desire to reach self-realization and the disciplined use of our energy. It is the focused and intense commitment needed to burn of f that which keeps us from being in the true state of yoga. Svadhyaya means self-study and observation. Through cultivating self-awareness, we can live in balance with all aspects of our being. Ishvarapranidhana pertains to total surrender to the creator . It is the recognition of an omnipresent force guiding and directing the course of our lives and the celebration of the divine spark of life that is within us and all living things. Yoga without the moral found ations of the yamas and niyamas is contradictory to the path of yoga, as it will most likely not have the desired effect. I have heard a few yoga students say they have felt bored during a yoga class. This is where I feel the practice and understanding of yamas and niyamas would be of benefit. By reducing the friction between one's outer actions and inner attitudes, one can begin to feel inner harmony and peace rather than carrying out postures with no internal framework. The third limb is asanas. According to Patanjali, the purpose of asanas is to balance the different nerve impulses by maintaining a steady and comfortable position that is firm but relaxed for extended periods of time. Later , asanas became a term for various postures used to restore and maintain a practitioner 's health and wellbeing by regulating internal organs, improving the body' s flexibility , and cultivating awareness, concentration, and relaxation.The fourth limb is pranayama. The purpose of pranayama is to control and expa nd the breath through the concentration of one's prana or life force. When practiced correctly , it can slow down the heart rate and mental activity , leading to a state of no-mind and inner bliss. Involves the conscious withdra wal of the senses to find union with oneself and life. Ultimately , the practice of pratyahara enables us to choose our responses rather than reacti ng. How does this translate into our yoga practice? It can simply mean to withdraw the ener gy of our thoughts about a pose by focusing on the pose itself. THE FINAL THREE STAGE S IN PATANJALI'S YOGA SYSTEM INCLUDE: Means to concentrate the mind through fixing the awareness to one object and exclu ding others. In an Ashtanga class, we are often told where to fix our gaze so we can stay focused and keep our mind from wandering. Is the total absence of thought during meditation, which results in deep tranquility and a feeling of oneness. During the World Yoga Convention held at Satyananda Ashram in Mangrove Mountain, Australia in October1978, Swami wati stated that in Patanjali' s Yoga Sutras, meditation is defined as \"When the mind has been able to transcend the knowledge of smell, sound, touch, form, and taste, and at the same time when the consciousness is functioning around one point.\" Means to experience bliss and a state of oneness through trans cending the mind and awakening to the truth of oneself. IF THE ESSENCE OF YOGA IS T O SUR VIVE IN AN ENVIRONMENT OF COMMERCIALISM, WHICH IS DRIVEN BY MONEY , SUCCESS, EGO, AND ST ATUS, THE FUNDAMENT ALS NEED T O BE PRACTICED AND T AUGHT IN THEIR ENTIRETY , AS THE GREA T SAGES OF YOGA INTENDED IT T O BE. If we can move forward with awareness and spread the true teachings of yoga, which encompasses so much more than just a physical workout; if we can allow the ancient teachings to penetrate our practice with the hope of spreading more love, compassion, and awareness to ourselves and all other living beings on Earth; if we can let our practice be the basis for all that is good and shine forth the beautiful beings we are, we can keep the true essence of yoga alive. PART 2 Physical W ellness \"When we become well, doubt melts away. We have energy to devote to our true purpose. We watch ourselves transform, and we believe in the good in life again. We get reacquainted with our path in this world. We find our way back home with peace in our heart and soul.\" - ANTHONY WILLIAM.I CHAPTER SEVEN The Three D's: Diet, Detox, and De-Stress t saddens me to think that almost everyone I talk to has been affected by cancer or known someone who has received a cancer diagnosis . We are at a time in history where almost everyone is suf fering from a chronic or mystery illness. Diabetes, heart disease, anxiety , depression, thyroid disorders, and autoimmune disease are on the rise. People want answers within a health system that is designed to treat the symptoms and not the root cause of their health compl aints. Meanwhile, people are getting sicker and sicker . Like you, many people are now turning to more natural ways to increase their levels of health and heal from chronic illness. Living in the 21st century means we are regula rly exposed to toxic substances such as herbicides, pesti cides, radiation, and toxic heavy metals, which can have an accumulative effect and weaken our body' s innate ability to heal, causing all sorts of health problems. We have technology that emits powerful electromagnetic frequencies, which weakens our immune system and throws our energetic system out of balance. We have pharmaceutical treatments and prescription drugs that contain toxic heavy metals and substances that are harmful to our health. Our food contains genetically modified organisms, and the air we breathe, the water we bathe in, and the soil we grow our food in contains toxic by- products from chemtrails. Our drinking water is filled with fluoride andchlorine, and now more than ever, there is a selection of fast-food restaurants on every street corner in every town. Our bodies are being constantly bombarded with toxic substances, it's no wonder we are all sick. Unfortunately , we cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that we are living in a toxic world, and if we are ever going to stand a fighting chance, we must detox our bodies from these unnatural substances or succumb to illness further down the track. When I say detox, I don't mean adopting a 3-day juice cleanse and then going back to consuming the same unproductive foods and living the same lifestyle. We must create a detox lifestyle that is sustainable over the long term. Otherwise , your body won't have the chance to get rid of what is holding it back from full health. For over 8 years, I suffered with symptoms so debilitating they left me bed ridden, and the one thing that pulled me out of poor health was cleansing. The most important thing we can do to protect ourselves from succumbing to chronic illness and disease is to cleanse. We need to be detoxing our bodies every day to remove the buildup of toxins so that we can heal and avoid becoming sick in the future. Many people are also following trendy high protein diets. The thing with high protein diets is they are high in fat. The problem with these diets is they put a tremendous strain on your adrenals, which pump out adrenaline in an attempt to thin your blood, and your liver which is most likely already overburdened with toxins, poisons, and pathogens. High protein diets create an excess amount of fat in the bloodstr eam, which creates suboptimal oxygen and over time, stagnant blood. Thick, stagnant blood, which Anthony William refers to as Dirty Blood Syndr ome hinders the body' s ability to eliminate toxins and absorb nutrients, which strains your liver, and the lack of oxyge n gives pathogens an opportunity to thrive. Most of us have sluggish, overburdened, and fatty or pre fatty livers from consuming a high fat, high protein diet and from a buildup of toxins and poisons that we are regularly exposed to. The liver is a miraculous organ and perhaps the most overworked, misunderstood, and under -acknowledged or gan in the human body . THE LIVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR: Processing fats and protecting your pancreas Glucose and glycogen storage to maintain blood sugar levels Vitamin and mineral storage Disarming and detaining harmful materials Screening and filtering your blood. Protecting you from viruses and bacteria The liver is a key player in detoxification, and when it constantly has to process fat, it takes time away from other more important jobs like neutralizing toxins. Stress also plays a significant role in health. Environmental stress from toxins weakens your immune system, which gives pathogens an opportunity to thrive, and emotional stress triggers the body to release adrenaline. Adrenaline pushes the nervous system into overdrive, and it is a number one food source for pathogens like Epstein-Barr virus . The foods we consume also trigger a rush of adrenaline. Caffeine in coffee, tea, cocoa, and matcha are highly addictive, and the adrenaline highs and lows that come with consuming them send us into chronic fight or flight. Consuming fats can also send us on an adrenaline high because the adrenals have to pump out adrenaline to comp ensate. Over time, all of this adrenaline becomes corrosive and toxic to the liver, and when the liver is underperforming, health issues can start to appear . Eating a diet that is focused on fruits, leafy greens, vegetables , herbs, spices, wild foods, and avoiding consuming unproductive foods is the best place to start to regain your health. IT IS CRUCIAL TO CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING WHEN EMBARKING ON YOUR HEALING JOURNEY : 1. Your pathogen load 2. Your toxin load 3. The health of your liver 4. Your adrenals 5. Your elimination pathways 6. Your lymphatic system 7. Your diet and hydration 8. Triggers that can weaken your immune system 9. Your emotional state If you are anything like me, you have probably seen multipl e health practitioners and no one knows what is causing your symptom s, or even worse; you may have been told your health problem is incurable and the only solution is sur gery or long-term medication. I know the feeling. You are tired, stressed, anxious, and you are fed up with spending hundreds of dollars on wellness programs, diets, supplements, and consultations with numerous health practitioners yet still not getting the results you want. You might be so chronically ill that you can't even work, whic h means you don't have money to spend on your health. If this is where you sit, don't be disheartened. I see you. You are not alone. With the right information, you can heal. I know you are exhausted from staying up all night, endlessly scrolling the internet to find answers and a solution to your health problem, getting your hopes up when you think you have found the answer only to be let down again. There is a lot of information circulating in the natural health world, however; not all of it is helpful. The truth is; a lot of natural health companies circulate broken theories and mistruths because they are a part of a huge money- making machin e that doesn' t have your best interests at heart. So, don't be overwhelmed by all the conflicting health information out there. The only health information I trust comes from numb er-one New York Times best-selling author Anthony William because that is the only information that healed me. If you don't know what to do or where to start to regain your health, consider this chapter the answer to your prayers! Perhaps you have already discovered Medical Medium information and you are feeling overwhelmed and stuck on your healing journe y. If that iswhere you sit, I am here to tell you that things will get better . You can heal, and I am going to show you the exact method that I used to heal myself. The key to heali ng is to prioritize where to focus your efforts by starting with your number one most debilitating symptom first. It can be confusing knowing where to start when you have a multitude of symptoms but focusing on your number one most challenging symptom that makes life hard to live often addresses the other symptoms. The root cause of most chronic illnesses and disease is toxins and pathogens. We all have a mixture of pathogens and toxins, and the viral strains and toxic blends will determine your symptoms. So, rest assured, you can now find comfort in knowing your body is not faulty . It is always working for you. TOXINS LIKE: Radiation Pesticides and herbicides Toxic heavy metals Chemicals and petrochemicals Viral corpses, neurotoxins, dermatoxins, and byproduct (viral poo) Toxic adrenaline from emotional traumas PATHOGENS LIKE: Over 60 varieties of Epstein-Barr virus Over 30 varieties of Shingles Cytomegalovirus Herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2 Human herpes virus (HHV) 6, 7, and 8 Multiple varieties of the undiscovered HHV -9 through to HHV -16 Over 50 strains H pylori E. coli Food-borne toxins C. dif ficile Staphylococcus Mold Parasites Salmonella PATHOGENS AND T OXINS ARE THE CULPRITS THA T NEED T O BE MADE ACCOUNT ABLE FOR YOUR SYMPT OMS. NOT YOUR GENES, YOUR MICROBIOME, YOUR HORMONES, OR YOUR BODY . Another thing to consider when you are healing is; inflamm ation is always caused by two things, an injury or a pathogen. When you look for the root cause of your number one symptom and you target a specific pathogen or toxin, it often clears up all the other symptoms in the process. Therefore, the best place to start is to cleanse the pathogens and toxins from your body , and the gentlest approach is through your diet.When cleaning up your diet, which has a cleansing effect, it is important to ensure your elimination pathways are open (urinary system, digestive system, skin) and your lymphatic system is working as it should. THE BEST WAYS TO OPEN UP YOUR ELIMINA TION PATHW AYS AND STRENGTHEN YOUR BODY'S ABILITY TO DET OX INCLUDE: Epsom salt baths Dry brushing Massage Infrared saunas Jumping on a rebounder for 10-20 minutes at least three times a week Taking liver supportive supplements If you dive in and undertake a cleanse or suddenly decide to clean up your diet and your elimination pathways are not clear or your liver is sluggish, your body will strugg le to get rid of the toxins you are trying to eliminate. The overload of toxins inadvertently puts excess strain on your liver and lymphatic system to clean up the mess, potentially causing all sorts of detox reactions and making you feel worse than before you started. It is important to understand that your liver is what largely determines your levels of health, and you must do everything you can to care for it. Think of it as being your biggest ally in life, your protector and caretaker . A sluggish, fatty, uncared for liver, alongside a combination of toxins, pathogens, and chronic stress, creates the perfect environment for ill-health. When detoxing, I recommend going slowly , listen to your body , start with cleaning up your diet, and focus on eating foods that nourish your liver. These nourishing foods will help your liver to successfully carry out detoxification, which will eliminate the risk of all of those toxins that you are trying to eliminate recirculating through your body .How do I know all of this works? I know mainstream medicine inside out. My first experience in the public health system was when my 4-year - old daughter was diagnosed with systemic Rheumatoid Arthritis in 2002. I can remember sitting up through the night and holding her in my arms, trying to console her while she was screaming in pain. As her mother , I felt so helpl ess because all I wanted to do was take her pain away . All the specialists I took her to see said the same thing: she was going to have this for life, and long-term medication was the best solution. Somewhere deep inside me, I didn' t believe what they said. It was not because I was in denial of my daughter being chronically ill, my gut told me not to believe it. Some might call it a mother 's instinct. I just knew she was capable of healing. Don' t get me wrong, I am not against conventional medicine. Emer gency medicine has its place. It saves many lives, but what I have seen repeatedly is a health system that is not based on preventative healthcare or treating the root causes of ill health. If the mainstream medical industry were to look at what is causing the epidemic of chronic illness, the pharmaceutical industry would lose billions of dollars, and the chemical industry would need to be made accountable. The cold hard truth is that there is money to be made from the chronically ill. The sad thing is most doctors are not even aware of the conflict of interests that make up our health system. After many sleepless nights, I was suddenly struck with an epiphany as I sat in the rheumatology department' s waiting room inside Auckland' s Starship Children' s Hospital. I noticed that most of the other children who suffered from the same terrible , debilitating disease were in wheelchairs, and nearly all of them had rounded, moon faces from the anti-inflammatory drugs that they had been prescribed by their doctors. At that moment, I thought, \"I do not want this life for my daughter ,\" so I took it into my own hands to heal her, completely , naturally , and without pharmaceutical drugs. The specialists laughed at me and thought I was crazy when I told them I did not want to go down the medication path, which had an alarmingly long list of side ef fects. So, from that day onward, I made it my life' s mission to heal her .I studied Reiki so that I could give her hands-on healing, and I undertook a naturopathic degree , however , I left at the end of the first year because I recognized a lot of inconsistencies in the training. What I realized was naturopathic doctors are indoctrinated into the same misinformed theories as medical doctors, such as: your genes are faulty; your hormones are to blame, and your body attacks itself. These misguided theories are not only disempowering to the chronically ill, but believing your body is at fault is what holds chronic illness sufferers back from healing. I took away from my year at naturopathy school a really good understanding of the human body , and in conjunction with certain herbs, supplements, and a gluten-free, plant-based, low-fat diet, my daughter went into complete remission. MY DAUGHTER IS LIVING PROOF THA T YOU T OO CAN HEAL. NO MA TTER WHA T DIAGNOSIS YOU HA VE BEEN PIGEONHOLED INT O OR WHA T THE DOCT ORS TELL YOU, YOU DO NOT HA VE T O SUCCUMB T O THE BELIEF THA T YOUR HEAL TH IS OUT OF YOUR HANDS AND THA T YOU ARE NOT CAP ABLE OF HEALING. The biggest lie that we are told is that we cannot heal ourselves, however , more and more people are beginning to wake up to this mistruth. More and more people are experiencing healings outside of conventional medicine that ver ges on the miraculous. After one year of following a healing protocol, my daughter went into complete remiss ion, much to the disbelief of the allopathic doctors who had originally thought I was crazy!I also know the health system inside out because for over eight years I suffered from recurrent attacks of debilitating vertigo and dizziness, which medical professionals could not correctly diagnose. I endured many invasive tests, and I received a multitude of diagnoses from various specialists. However , the doctor s always told me the same thing: There was no cure, and I would just have to live with it. On top of it all, I suffered from anxiety , debilitating panic attack s, and a host of other mystery neurolog ical symptoms, which held me back from living life to the fullest. Being chronical ly ill and not knowing why you feel so bad is a tough place to be. The stakes are high. Your ability to work, your relationships, and your happin ess are on the line. Like most people suffering from chronic health problems, you are willing to do whatever it takes to heal yourself. But not knowing what is causing your symptoms, where to start, or how to go about healing keeps you stuck. The thing is, with the right information and support\u2014you can heal. My daughter 's recovery instill ed in me an unwavering faith. I had healed her naturally , and now it was time to heal myself. So, after feeling exasperated within a medical system that was not interested in finding or treating the root causes of my condition, I decided to utilize the knowledge I had gained from studying natural health and create a healing plan for myself. The important turning point in my health came when my mother , who was suffering from Fibromyalgia at the time, gave me a book called Medical Medium : Secrets Behind Chronic and Mystery Illness and How to Finally Heal by Anthony W illiam. Anthony William was born with a special gift that enables him to converse with a divine force called Spirit of Compassion . Since age four, Spirit of Compassion has provided him with extraordinarily accurate health information and Anthony has been using his unique abilities to read people' s conditio ns and tell them how to restore their health. He has helped thousands of people from all over the globe recover from the most serious, hard-to-diagnose illnesses and he has helped doctors solve their most challenging cases. So many people have been quick to call Anthony William a phony, but the proof is there. Millions of people are healing around the world byapplying Medical Medium infor mation. The evidence is there in the healing stories, and in my opinion, this type of research that is voluntarily carried out by millions of people who have no vested interest or financial gain accounts for more than scientific research, which is often one-sided and backed by Big Pharma or funded with strings attached . I began reading the book, and immediately everything started to make sense. All of the pain, suffering and misdiagnoses made sense now that I knew the underlying causes of my vertigo, anxiety , endometriosis, and neurological symptoms. All of the well-meaning doctors and specialists who were treating me were limited by their training, and although they were trying to find the answers, they didn' t know the truth because what is taught in medical schools is often funded by the pharmaceutical industry and back ed by faulty science, which has a vested interest in people remaining sick. THE BIGGEST LESSON I LEARNED THROUGH MY EXPERIENCE OF BEING CHRONICALL Y ILL IS THE MOST IMPOR TANT STEP T O TAKE IS FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR HEAL TH RA THER THAN REL YING SOLEL Y ON MAINSTREAM MEDICINE, WHICH TREA TS THE SYMPT OMS AND NOT THE ROOT CAUSE. Contrary to what we are being told and what is being taught in medical schools worldwide, there is strong evidence to suggest that you can heal most illness and disease with the right healing foods and lifestyle habits. The human body is a miraculous organism made up of trillions of cells. It is designed to protect you and keep you alive, and it has an innate ability to maintain homeostasis. It will never turn on you, like what anautoimmune diagnosis suggest s. The body does not attack itself. The medical commu nity came up with that term because blaming the patients' body was the easiest thing to do without having the answers. THE MEDICAL EST ABLISHMENT AND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES DO NOT W ANT T O BE ACCOUNT ABLE T O THE TRUTH, AND THA T IS SICKNESS IS A BILLION-DOLLAR INDUSTR Y. I am not saying that medicine and doctors are inherently bad. If you have a hard time understanding this concept, I invite you to look deeper into the medical establishment. Whe n you do, you will start to see a whole new world, a world full of misinformation that started way back before medical schools even came into existenc e. One that does not have your best interests at heart, one that is manipulated toward profits. Sometimes it is hard to look at structures and systems that are ingrained into our society and etched into our belief systems with a critical eye. It's easier to run with the status quo and believe things at face value. But I challenge you to put your beliefs aside for the time being and arm yourself with an open mind and critical eye that welcomes new information. After reading Medical Medium: Secrets Behind Chronic and Mystery Illness and How to Finally Heal , I finall y unders tood the underlying causes of my health condition. I discovered that I, along with most of the world' s population, was infected with an underlying virus, which was creating a secret epidemic . Anthony William explains the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is responsible for almost every mystery illness imaginable. According to his statistics, over 225 million Americans have at least one of over 60 varieties of EBV .EBV, also known as mononuc leosis or the kissing disease, has four distinct stages. In stage one, the virus goes mostly unnoticed. It floats around in your bloodstream, patiently waiting for an opportunity to attack. Emotions, hormonal chang es, nutritional deficiencies, stress, and reproduct ive changes such as ovulati on and menstruation can trigger an attack. The virus is undetectable by tests, it causes no symptoms, and most people are unaware they have it. In stage two, EBV turns into mononucleosis. The virus is most contagious durin g this period, and it can spread through blood, saliva, and other bodily fluids. During this stage your immune system jumps to your defense, and the severity of the battle is dependent on a multitud e of factors including the strength of your immune system and the number of other pathogens you have. The virus seeks out to hide in one or more of your organs, particularly your liver , spleen, and reproductive or gans. To make things worse, EBV' s best friend is the bacterium Streptococcus . Having both pathogens taxes your immune system, and creates an array of health issues, including urinary tract infections, acne, ear infections, and sinus infections. In stage three, EBV nests in your organs and tries to enter your thyroid. Thyroid disease is now rampant, and the medical community is unaware that EBV is the cause. Tests will find antibodies, which indicates a past infection when the virus was in its mono phase, however , there will be no sign of EBV presently active in the bloodstream. During this stage, the virus creates poisonous by-product, viral corpses (they have a 6-week life cycle), neurotoxins, and dermatoxins which compromise your liver and create many chronic symptoms. The virus hangs around, waiting for a trigger in the form of an unproductive food, emotional stress, nutritiona l deficiency , reproductive change, adrenaline, mold, toxin, COVID, the flu, or anything else that weakens your immune system so that it can grow in numbers. The key thing to know is EBV is a living organism, and it loves to consume certain things to survive. It relies on these triggers so it can continue to grow stron ger and build an army to fight against your immune system. In stage four, EBV leaves your thyroid, and it sets out to attack your central nervous system. During phase four, the virus is at its all-time worst,causing significant mystery illness symptoms, including fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, anxie ty, asthma, insomnia, vertig o, dizziness, tinnitus, thyroid disease, migrai nes, Lupus, depression, and L yme disease. There is no current screening of EBV in the blood, so you can become infected by receiving blood transfusions or through bodily fluids such as kissing, sneezing, or having sex with someone infected. Babies can become infected by their mothers, and people who eat out can become infected by eating food prepared by a chef who cut their finger . Depending on the EBV strain, it can nest for years in your organs, or it may create serious health problems after only a few months. As soon as I learned that the anxiety , vertigo, and neurological symptoms that I had suffered with for over a decade was caused by a rogue virus that had attacked my central nervous system, along with a buildup of heavy metals and adrenaline damage from years of chronic stress, I could finally begin to heal myself. After all, what you don' t know you can' t fix! It is important to understand that until you rid your body of these harmful pathogens and toxin s and bring your body back into an environment conducive to healing, any actions you take to improve your health will most likely not have the desired effect. It is a bit like servicing a car without first changing the oil and filter . Any new oil that you add will not be fully utilized because the old oil and filter had not first been removed. Despite all that I had learned during my studies at naturopathy school, I had never heard that EBV could be accountable for so many chronic and mystery illnesses. The mere thought of so many people suffering, yet this informa tion was not even in alternative medicine schools, was alarming. My brain was like a sponge, and as soon as I read the information in The Medical Medium books, I applied it to my life. Even the seemingly small, insignificant steps I took at the time have amounted to significant changes, so know that everythin g you do, whether it be drinking a glass of lemon water in the morning or increasing your fruit and vegetable consumption does make a difference. I first wrote a list of my symptoms in2016, and each year I updated the list. I am pleased to say that I have healed most of the symptoms from the long lists that I compiled over the years! If you are considering or have started to change your diet or lifestyle, the best advice I can give is: do the best you can, but don't try to be perfect. You will have days where you stuff up, but that's okay . Start again the next day. After enough repetition, it becomes a habit. I remember drinking my first glass of celery juice, and I couldn 't stand the taste. But I forced myself to drink it because I wanted to experience the health benefits. After only a couple of days, I began to like the taste, and after the first week, my body started to crave it. So, even if you don't like the taste of something, give it a try anyway . You might be surprised at how quickly you will come to like it. Remember to tell yourself \"I choose to drink/eat X Y and Z because it is healthy for me\" rather than thinking \"This is disgusting, I hate it!\" A few years ago, I was so excited to start the Medical Medium 28-day raw food cleanse. My fridge was bursting with fresh organic produce from my local markets, and although I started with the commitment and drive to see it through, a week in I started to feel weak and dizzy , so I returned to how I was eating before I started. At the time I felt like a failure , but what I didn' t realize was, I was suffering from adrenal fatigue and a sluggish overburdened liver that was struggling to cleanse properly . I now look back and think to myself, \"If only I knew what I know now!\" The important lesson here is: You must listen to your body above any person, cleanse, diet, or protocol, and make adjustments when needed. There is no one else in the world who is better at giving you the right health information than you. Your body gives you feedback in the form of symptoms; there fore, you know your body and symptoms inside out, and you know intuitively what your body needs. Not that woman on Facebook and Instagram who healed herself, not your doctor , naturopath, nutritionist, health coach, or healer . You and only you! If something doesn 't feel right, despite what you have read or been told, make adjustments and do what feels right. Diets, and cleanses are not good when followed rigidly and without regard to your own body , set of symptoms, and inner knowing. However , detoxing is not always going to make you feel good, so please don't giveup. Knowing when to push through or pull back when you are healing is a fine art and comes with practice. The truth is, I healed my daughter long before I read the Medical Medium books. I healed her because I followed my intuition, and I believed she could heal without pharmaceuticals. It was a year full of ups and downs and trial and error and I had moments where I questioned if I was doing the right thing, but if I hadn' t taken that leap of faith, I truly believ e she would be in a wheelchair by now . I will forever be grateful to Anthony William. Applying Medical Medium inform ation was the only thing that pulled me out of the ashes of suffering from chronic illness , and it is the only source of health information I trust. SOMETIMES IT T AKES A CHRONIC HEAL TH CONDITION T O WAKE US UP AND THROW US ON T O A P ATH THA T IS MORE ALIGNED WITH OUR SOUL 'S PURPOSE. WHA TEVER THE REASON, KNOW THA T HEALING IS POSSIBLE. I SEE YOU. I BELIEVE IN YOU. IT IS GOING T O BE OKA Y. YOU DON'T HA VE TO ST AY SUFFERING LIKE THIS FOREVER. To regain control of your healt h, I recommend starting with your diet and then easing your way towar d a Medical Medium cleanse. Cleaning up your diet alone is powerfully cleansing, and it can have a signifi cant impact on your overall health and wellbeing. The following information throu ghout this chapter is largely based upon what I have learned through Medical Medium information.Diet There are so many fad diets out there, but the truth is, a diet that works for one person might not work for another . We must be discerning and realize that diets are not one size fits all. There are many natural health companies prom oting products too. Still, we need to be careful of natural health companie s because some compromise quality for profit. We need to remember that food is our medicine, so whatever we put into our mouths can either create healing or disease. While a paleo diet high in prote in may suit someone, who is relatively healthy and not suffering from any chronic illness, it may worsen a chronically ill person. Because a person suffering from a chronic health condition is most likely also battling EBV and a host of other viruses and unproductive bacteria, which is causing their symptoms. Therefore, your diet needs to be tailored to your individual needs. It is important to understand that consuming unproductive foods feeds the bugs that are robbing you of your health. Viruses love feeding on eggs, dairy , gluten, toxic heavy metals, and they release neurotoxic by-products which could be the root cause of your symptoms. When thinking about your diet, it is essential to listen to your unique body . Consider what your goals are and what you are trying to achieve, and above all else, make dietary adjustments as you need to. IF YOU WANT TO FEEL WELL AND GIVE YOUR BODY THE BEST CHANCE TO HEAL, I STRONGL Y SUGGEST FOCUSING ON EATING PLENTY OF ORGANIC PLANT -BASED FOODS SUCH AS: Organic leafy greens Fruits Vegetables Herbs and spices Wild foods Critical clean carbohydrates such as fruit, raw honey , coconut water , winter squash, sweet potatoes, and potatoes. The best grains that are easiest to digest are quinoa, millet, and gluten-free oats. If you want to eat beans and legumes eat them sparingly as beans are a source of protein and even a small amount of protein hinders your body' s ability to cleanse. If you want to eat rice, opt for or ganic brown rice. The golden rule to optimize healing is to increase hydration and decrease radical fats (the majority of the food' s calories are derived from fat.) Fat and protein clog up your liver and bloodstream, which makes it really hard to cleanse. Every organ and system in your body is made up of trillions of cells, and those cells run on glucose and mineral salts. If your diet consists of more than 15 percent radical fat, your liver has to work harder by producing bile to break down the fat so your cells can utilize glucose to support optimal or gan function. A high fat, high protein diet causes your pancreas to work harder to produce more insulin, your liver's bile supply becomes overworked and eventually weak ens, your seven different blends of stomach acid breaks- down, and your adrenal glands weaken because they have to constantly pump out adren aline to keep you in a state of homeostasis because your cells can' t absorb enough glucose in the presence of fat. Eventually , the stomach and intestinal tract becomes clogged with old rotting protein and fat from weakened bile and hydrochloric acid that putrefy , which creates a breeding ground for unproductive bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The rancid and putrefied proteins and fats that sit in the linings of your stomach and intestinal tract cause ammonia gas which can seep through the intestinal walls and create amm onia permeability . This proce ss leads to many gut health symptoms and chronic health issues. When you lower your fats, your heart and brain will be protected because your brain runs off glucose not fat, and your cells can absorb glucose from fruits, and minera l salts from celery juice and leafy greensmore easily. This will enable your liver to get on with performing it's over 2000 chemical functions more ef ficiently so you can stay healthy . If you want to consume plant protein like avocado, nuts, and seeds, it is best to consume it after midday . This will give your liver a long enough window to cleanse. If you want to consume animal protein, it is best to eat it once a day at dinner . Another thing to consider is the stren gth of your adrenals. Removing radical fats from your diet can increase detoxification and make you feel more tired and hungry if you have weak adrenals. This is where you need to tune into your body and listen to your intuition. RADICAL F ATS INCLUDE: Animal protein Dairy products Eggs Avocados Nuts and nut butters Seeds Oils Olives Bone broth Coconut (meat and milk) Fats to conside r eliminating entirely are canola oil, eggs, dairy , and pork. Fats to consider lowering include avocados, nuts, seeds, coconut, healthier oils, and animal protei n. Your body will do the most healing and cleansing if you limit your radical fats to 10-15 percent of your daily food intake. However , when underta king a Medical Medium cleanse, your fat intake needs to be zero.NEXT , ELIMINA TE THE FOLLOWING UNPRODUCTIVE FOODS FROM YOUR DIET . THE FOODS LISTED AT THE TOP OF THE LIST ARE THE HIGHEST PRIORITY : Eggs Dairy Gluten Soft drinks Be mindful of salt consumption. Pork Tuna Corn Industrial food oils including vegetable oil, palm oil, canola oil, corn oil, saf flower oil, and soybean oil. Soy Lamb Fish and seafood (other than wild salmon, trout, sardines, mackerel, halibut, and haddock.) Vinegar , including apple cider . Fermented foods including kombucha, sauerkraut and coconut aminos. Caffeine, including cof fee, matcha, and chocolate. Grains (other than millet and oats.) Limit healthy oils including olive, walnut, coconut, sunflower , avocado, sesame, grapeseed, almond, macadamia, peanut, flaxseed.ADDITIONALL OR REMOVE: Alcohol Natural/artificial flavors Nutritional yeast Citric acid Aspartame Other artificial sweeteners Monosodium glutamate (MSG) Formaldehyde Preservatives If you feel overwhelmed by removing so many foods at once, start by choosing the first one or two foods at the top of the list and systematically work your way down the list as you feel ready . All of the foods above fall into one of four categories: bug fuel, blood thickeners, toxin contributors, and dehydrators. The key thing to remember is they are holding you back from healing. They feed the bugs that you are trying to get rid of, contribute to toxici ty, hinder your body' s ability to cleanse, and overburde n your liver and adrenals. FOCUS ON BRINGING MORE OF THESE NOURISHIN G LIVER FOODS INT O YOUR DIET : Artichokes Apples Asparagus Bananas Berries Brussels sprouts Celery Cilantro Cranberries Cucumbers Dandelion Lemons Melons Peaches Oranges Tangerines Pitaya (dragon fruit) Raw honey Spinach Tomatoes Wild blueberries LIVER SUPPO RTIVE SUPP tea tea Ginger tea Spirulina Yellow dock Wild blueberry powder Water W eight It is important to understand, when your liver is overburdened with toxic troublemakers, the excess toxins and poisons often spill over into your lymphatic system. If this happens, your body will create fluid to suspend the excess toxins to stop them from going to your brain and heart. The excess fluid can sometimes look like weight gain, however , when you support your liver, you will also support your lymphatic syste m, and the water weight will naturally disperse over time. This is one example of how your body is always working for you. Morning Cleanse The best and easiest way to start cleansing is to drink 16-32 oz of filtered water with the juice of half or one whole lemon or lime upon waking, on an empty stomach . If you want to cleanse deeper , 15- 30 minutes later drink 16-32 oz of plain celery juice then wait another 15 to 30 minutes before eating. If you have the time, 30 minutes between each is ideal. To give your liver the longest window to cleanse, keep fat and protein out until after midday , this includes plant-based fats such as avocado, nuts, and plant milks. Eating protein once a day at dinner is best.To go deep and give your liver the loving care and attention it deserves, make the Medical Medium Liver Rescue Smoothie for breakfast. (The recipe can be found on the Medical Medium blog.) 28-DA Y RA W FOOD CLEANSE To give yourself an added boost, the Medical Medium 28-day raw food cleanse is a powerful way to detox the body . Consuming only organic, raw fruits, herbs, wild foods, and vegetables and eating as much as you like throughout the day will give your body the vital nutrients it needs to heal. If you suffer from adrenal fatigue, you might want to start slowly , graze on adrenal snacks every one and a half to two hours, add cooked potatoes and sweet potatoes to keep your blood sugar levels balanced, and eat plenty of bananas and dates. AFTER THE CLEANSE, AVOID CONSUMING THE FOODS ON THE UNPRODUCTIVE FOODS LIST ABOVE AND EAT PLENTY OF: Organic leafy greens Fruit Vegetables, raw or well steamed is best. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, and squash; steamed with no fat or oil is ideal. Soups and broths Fresh garlic and onions Herbs and spices Wild foods Green smoothies Spirulina Herbal teas Coconut water Raw wildflower honey Wild blueberries Heavy Metal Detox Now that you are armed with a healthier diet, let's dive deeper and start detoxing those toxic heavy metals. Heavy metals are hidden antagonists that can find their way into our bodies. Mercury from amalgam dental fillings, vaccines, and seafood as well as aluminum from foil and copper from your water pipes are highly toxic. Over time, they can build up in the body , causing all sorts of health problems. Even worse, EBV gravitates toward bodily tissues that contain a buildup of toxins. Heavy metal s together with EBV weakens the immune system and holds back healing. If you suffer from anxiety , depression, or neurological symptoms, removing the heavy metals in your body is critical. The Medical Medium Heavy Metal Detox is by far the best way to remove heavy metals from your body . You can either consume all five ingredients together in a smoothie, or separately every day. When consumed daily , they work syner gistically as a team to pull heavy metals out of your body safely and ef fectively . LET'S LOOK AT SOME OF THE PROPER OF THESE FIVE IMPOR TANT DET OXIFYING FOODS: SPIRULINA: draws out heavy metals from your brain, central nervous system, and liver. It also soaks up heavy metals extracted by the barley grass juice extract powder . Take 1-2 teaspoons each day mixed in fresh orange or apple juice or coconut water . BARLEY GRASS JUICE POWDER: draws heavy metals out of your spleen, intestinal tract, pancreas, thyroid, and reproductive system. It also prepares the mercury for complete absorption by the spirul ina. Take 1- 2 teaspoons each day mixed into fresh orange or apple juice or coconut water . CILANTRO: goes deep into hard-to-reach places, extracting metals that you may have inherited from birth. Blend one cup in a smoothie or add to salad or guacamole. WILD BLUEBERRIES: draw heavy metals out of your brain tissue, healing and repairing any gaps created by oxidation when the heavy metals are removed. It is important to buy wild blueberries, as they possess unique phytonutrients with remarkable detoxifying capabilities. Eat at least one cup daily or blend into a smoothie. ATLANTIC DULSE: binds to mercury , lead, aluminum, copper , cadmium, and nickel. It goes deep into hidden places of the digestive tract and gut, seeking out mercury , binding to it, and never releasing it until it leaves the body . Blend into a smoothie or eat one tablespoon of flakes daily or an equal number of strips if it is in whole-leaf form. Along with making a daily smoothie, drinking celery juice every morning is highly beneficial. Celery juice' s mineral salts give extra support to the five heavy metal detox foods by helping to flush metals out of the liver. As you begin to detox heavy metals, keep the unproductive foods out of your diet and fill your body with fruits and vegetables. These dietary changes will help with the process of drawing heavy metals out of your body . It is also essential to drink plenty of filtered water while you detox, which helps to flush toxins out. I don't recommend alkaline water as the digestive system has to work harder at lowering it. Water with a P.H of 7.7 is ideal, and water filters that leave the minerals in are best. I recommendinvesting in a Berkey water filtration system, which is what I use and recommended to my clients. Adding lemon or lime to your water revitalizes it and makes it more hydrating. The liver is the storehouse for all the toxins you have ever come into contact with and most of the time it is severely dehydrated, so, it is important that you drink at least an additional 32oz of lemon water on top of your morning lemon water throughout the day . Pathogen Detox To help rid the body of EBV, and other viruses and unproductive bacteria, you can attack them directly with supplements. Here is a list of the top Medical Medium recomme nded anti-viral supplements that I used to regain my health and what I recommend to clients: Cat's claw L-lysine Liquid zinc sulfate Vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin and/or adenosylcobalamin) Licorice root Lemon balm Vitamin C (Micro C) Antiviral supplements should be continued for 6 months after your symptoms subside. After this period, you can move onto the baseline supplements for life. A word of caution: There are many options for choosing a vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplement, and the companies that produce the supplements manufacture them in different ways. Some companies use inactive forms of the vitamin or very little, which means they can label it as an active form. Others add up to 10 percent of fillers to increase their profits and the mystery ingredients aren't written on the supplement labels. Try to avoid supplements that contain citric acid, as it is essentially derived frommold, which ultimately weakens your immune system. Herbal products that contain alcohol should also be avoided as the alcohol nullifies the therapeutic constituent in the herb, and often the alcohol is made from genetically modified corn. If in doubt, seek the advice of a qualified natural health practitioner when choosing supplements. Everyone is deficient in vitamin B12 and zinc, therefore it is imperative to prioritize those two above the others if you are unable to purchase them all. The best, and most-cleanest supplements are from vimer gy.com. TOP FOUR BASELINE SUPPLEMENTS: Liquid zinc sulfate Vitamin B12 (as methylcobalamin and/or adenosylcobalamin) Vitamin C (Micro C) Lemon balm SUPPLEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENT INGREDIENTS T O AVOID: Fish oils are made from the of fcuts of fish and the process that they use to remove mercury potentizes it. Collagen Chlorella Hydrochloric acid Baking soda (taken internally) Iron supplements that aren' t plant based Multivitamins Hair, nail, and skin supplements Glandular supplements Whey protein powder Gut powder blends Apple cider vinegar products Diatomaceous earth L-Carnitine Preservatives Alcohol Citric acid Bovine derivatives Natural flavors Healing Reactions V ersus Flar es Common healin g reactions while cleansing include an increase in bowel movements, urination, or sweating, which is normal during a detox. A flare is when you experience an increase in pre-existing symptoms. A flare in symptoms means you have an increase in viral activity in your body . Viruses can fight to stay alive in a body that is trying to get rid of them, and when they die off, they can release poisons that make you feel sick. However , a flare in sympto ms is not always caused by taking antiviral supplements and adopting a cleanse. Sometimes they can be triggered by extra stress, eating unproduct ive foods, exposure to a toxin in your environment, pathogens finding hidden pockets of unproductive foods that are hiding out in your liver , or during menstruation and ovulation. If your detox symptoms are extreme, intolerable, and they last longer than a day or two, it is a sign to go slower . Usually , detox symptoms are caused by a weak sluggish liver that is backed up with toxins. If you do experience a strong detox reaction, I recommend focusing on healing your liver.A GENERAL RULE OF THUMB IS: When viral symptoms go up: increase antiviral supplements and support your adrenals. If detox symptoms are too intense: slow down until symptoms subside and begin slowly again. Cravings and the Emotional Side of Cleansing Revealed Ever wondered why it can be so darn hard sticking to the guideli nes of a cleanse? There are physiological reasons behind cravings, which include: 1. Pathogenic die-of f 2. Fat cells dispersing 3. Release of adrenaline and toxins THERE ARE USUALL Y TWO TYPES OF PEOPLE: People who eat to avoid emotio nal pain. Comfort food eaters store adrenaline from the emotional event in fat cells. Cleansing disperses fat cells and old storage bins of adrenaline, which can trigger an emotional release and food cravings. People who avoid eating when in emotional pain. Under -eaters trigger adrenalin e surges because the adrenal glands sense a drop in blood glucose, and the adrenals release adrenaline to keep the body functioning. THE KEY POINTS T O REMEMBER WHILE CLEANSING ARE: The goal of cleansing is to starve the pathogens of their food sources and clean out toxins and poisons. As viruses die of f, they send chemical signals to the brain, which tells you to eat unproductive foods like ice cream and pizza to keep them alive. Comfort foods are usually high in fat, and fat sops up the adrenaline that is associated to the emotional upset. When you take away comfort foods, the people who eat to avoid emotional pain can sometimes experience the pain they were trying to avoid while on a cleanse. Adrenaline and other toxic troublemakers are stored in fat cells that surround your or gans and tissues. Adrenaline holds information of the emotional event. Cleansing disperses fat cells and old storage bins of adrenaline. This is why some people experience emotional highs and lows while cleansing. Cravings are a good sign that your body is letting go of pathogenic fuel that you ate in the past. As you can see, cleansing is just as much an emotional, mental, and spiritual journey as it is a physical journey . If emotions or cravings arise during your cleanse, it is perfec tly natural and normal. Know that you are releasing emotions, toxins, viruses, and unproductive bacteria safely , while finding freedom from the chain s of toxins, bugs, and emotion al pain that has been holding you back throughout your life. Protecting Y our Adr enals When you are cleansing it is critical that you eat enough calories throughout the day . You should never go hungry . If you have weak adrenals, it is equally important to graze on adrenal snacks like dates, apples, and celery , which contain the right blend of glucose, sodium, and potassium, every one and a half to two hours to keep your blood glucose levels stable and avoid an adrenaline dump. Your adrenal glands produce 56 differentblends of adrenaline, and depen ding on the situation, some blends are more potent than others. A certain amount of adrenaline is natural and healthy . It is when stress becomes chronic, or continuously skipping meals, that puts a strain on your adrenals and liver . ADRENALINE SURGES CAN BE TRIGGERED BY : 1. Dangerous cleanses that do not support your adrenals 2. Skipping meals or not eating often enough 3. Over stimulation 4. Chronic stress and trauma 5. Adrenaline based activities A lot of people with chronic health problems have compromised adrenals, and your organs, tissue , and fat cells soak up adrenaline, which is highly acidic and toxic to your nervous system and liver. The fascinating thing is, your liver neutralizes adrenaline to protect your white blood cells, brain, stomach, bones, and to avoid fueling pathogens, and it does this by using a chemical compound that it formed from old hormones it neutralized. The chemical compound acts like bait and the adrenaline gravitates towar d it thinking if it bands together , it will grow stronger . The old hormone diffuses the new hormone, and the liver flushes it out via the kidneys. The important thing to know is if you eat a high fat, high protein diet (including plant proteins), the liver will struggle to neutralize adrenaline and it will store it. A high protein, high fat diet also suspends adrenaline in fat cells, and a liver filled with troublemakers like adrenalin e becomes sluggish, which is the root cause behind many chronic health problems today . The key point here is horm ones (adrenaline and cortisol) holds information from the event, which is why sometimes it is hard to let go of old emotions. When we cleanse, we are releasing old adrenaline from cells, tissues, organs, and stored fat. This explains why sometimes we can experience dif ferent emotions arising when cleansing.When we clean up the liver through cleansing, we let go of fat so the liver can process old adrenaline and shield you from reliving those same experiences over and over again. Adrenaline' s Role in Cleansing The adrenal glands produce a more liver friendly brew of adrenaline when cleansing. For every one-part poison, it releases two parts -adrenaline. The adrenaline creates a rush, which helps to flush everything out through the blood stream. ADRENAL SUPPOR TIVE SUPPLEMENTS INCLUDE: 5MTHF Cordyceps Panax ginseng Rhodiola Oat straw Barley grass juice powder Astragalus Lemon balm Raspberry leaf Healing Y our Gut When it comes to gut health, there is a great deal of misinformation lurking around. Your microbiome is not the answer to gut health, and good bacteria and bad bacteria do not compete with each other . It does not matter how many probiotic or gut health supplements you take, if you are not removing viruse s like shingles and unproductive bacteria like Streptococcus and H pylori , you will not overcome your digestive issues. The health of your gut is determ ined by the health of your liver and the number of viruses, heavy metals, and unproductive bacteria that resides in your gut. You could have all of the friendly , beneficial bacteria in the world and still end up in the emer gency department with severe gut inflammation from the shingles virus. There are many harmful gut health trends circulating too. Consuming fermented foods, bone broth, apple cider vinegar , and diatomaceous earth products are not your golden tickets to a healthy gut. In fact, they do more harm than good. It is essential to understand the truth so that you can learn the right information to facilitate healing. IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM DIGESTIVE DISCOMFOR T, THE THREE GOLDEN KEYS T O HEALING YOUR GUT ARE: 1. Fight pathogens 2. Strengthen bile 3. Restore hydrochloric acidThe best thing you can do for your gut is to lower your fat and protein intake and drink celery juice every day. Drinking 16-32oz of plain celery juice every morning on an empty stomach, and 15-30 minutes away from food, can start to turn around gut issues and other health symptoms. Celery juice kills pathogens, strengthens hydrochloric acid, and helps to flush away toxins, fat, and undigested proteins from your intestinal tract. Other healing foods that support the gut include aloe water , which is incredibly anti-viral and anti-bacterial, and papaya, which is soothing to the nerves in the intestinal tract. Peppermint and ginger tea are two healing drinks you can also incorporate. The best probio tics are the ones found on organic produce. If you eat plenty of fresh organic sprouts, leafy greens, herbs, fruit, and vegetables every day, you are giving yourself a boost of elevated biotics, which aren' t found in any probiotic supplement. Elevated biotics, according to Medical Medium information, are undiscovered microor ganisms that sit atop organic produce. SUPPLEMENTS T O AID WITH GUT HEAL TH INCLUDE: Barley grass juice powder Chaga mushroom powder (Used periodically , this can be beneficial if you are fighting bugs in your gut. ) To heal gut issues, avoid consuming unproductive foods which feed viruses and bacteria, and focus on strengthening your bile and hydrochloric acid levels by drinking celery juice, cleansing your liver , lowering your fats,and bringing in the right healing foods, herbs, and supplements. Remember , the first step to finding true healing is to know that your body is working for you, you just have to give it the right tools. Working on your gut health takes commitme nt and consistent daily action. After all, healing is a long- term process, not an overnight one. Please know that everything you do will bring you one step closer to healing. Juicing Unless you are consuming a highly processed diet, fiber in fruits and vegetables is not needed. In fact, fiber contains no nutrients, it is merely the plant' s skeleton. The nutrients from plant foods gets separated from fiber and delivered to your blood stream. Fiber on the other hand is eliminated via your poop. So, if you want to superchar ge your cleanse, you might want to consider a one-day juice fast of celery , apple, and cucumber . This combination has the proper balance of mineral salts, potassium, and glucose to keep your blood sugar levels stable, while at the same time; your body cleanses itself of toxic heavy metals. Other alternatives include lemon water and pure aloe vera juice. If you do incorporate a one-day juice fast, you want to be sure that you drink plenty and often. If your adrenals are weak and your blood glucose crashes, it could trigger an adrenaline dump, and that is not what you want when you are cleansing. Whether you incorporate a one-day juice fast or not, there are many different options when it comes to juicing , and it is a great way to stay hydrated while you cleanse. THE BLOOD DRA W SECRET Anthony William says the number one thing that could be holding us back from full health is having large blood draws. Your immune system lives in your blood, and every time you give your precious blood away for testing, you lose an army of white blood cells. Think of your white blood cells as soldiers. They are what keeps viruses at bay. They communicate with each other , and if one goes down, two others will step in and fight for you. They patrol your body looking fortoxins and pathogens while keeping your brain and heart safe from invaders. When your blood is drawn your defenses are weakened, which gives viruses an oppo rtunity to take over and thrive. This is not what you want when you alread y suffer from chronic health issues. You need your immune system strong. It takes weeks or months for your complete blood count to rebuild after a blood draw , and it is your white blood cells that determine your state of health. A man' s health is very different to a woman' s health, and, unfor tunately , women are up against a lot more than men because they carry the responsibility of procreation. They are severely disadvantaged because a woman' s immune system lowe rs throughout natural life stages, such as ovulation, menstruation, pregnancy , and childbirth. Eighty percent of a woman' s immune system goes to her reproductive system during menstruation, leaving only 20 percent of her immune system to watch over the rest of her body. Forty percent of a woman' s immune system goes to her reproductive system during ovulation, 50 percent of a woman' s immune system goes to her baby and reproductive system during pregna ncy, and 90 percent of a woman' s immune system goes to her reproductive system during childbirth. These factors, including weigh t and your state of health, should be factored into the amount of blood that is taken during a blood draw . However , it isn't. In fact, they take a lot more blood than what is needed, and most of the time they throw the rest away . Even worse, people walk away from large blood draws sicker than ever before, while doctors frantically draw more blood, looking for answers to why their patients are so chronically ill. TO PROTECT YOURSELF AND SAFEGUARD YOUR HEAL TH, FOLLOW THESE BLOOD DRA W GUIDELINES: If you are a strong healthy woman, you weigh over 150 pounds, and you suf fer from no symptoms, ask for no more than four vials to be taken at a time. Half vials are better , so two full vials in total. If you are a strong healthy woman, you weigh under 150 pounds and you suf fer from no symptoms, ask for no more than three vials of blood to be taken at any one time. Half vials are better . If you are a woman who suf fers from chronic health problems, and you weigh over 100 pounds, ask for no more than two vials of blood to be taken at one time. Half vials are better . If you are a woman who weighs under 100 pounds, and you suf fer from chronic health problems, ask for no more than one vial of blood to be taken at a time. One half vial is better . Always allow yourself at least five days between larger blood draws to give your body a chance to recoup. AT LEAST ONE WEEK PRIOR T O YOUR BLOOD DRA W: Schedule your blood draw at least one week before or after menstruation when your immune system is the strongest. Stay well hydrated and add lemon or lime to your water . Reduce or eliminate caf feine. Drink at least 16 oz of plain celery juice every morning on an empty stomach, 15-30 minutes away from food. Drink 16-32 oz blended melon in the morning. Melon builds electrolytes and glucose reserves and hydrates bone marrow . Eat plenty of potatoes and sweet potatoes for dinner (fat free with no oil) Lower or eliminate radical fats. If consuming radical fats, eat with dinner only . Snack on plenty of fruit throughout the day . Include lots of leafy greens. The Medical Medium Spinach Soup is ideal. The recipe can be found on the Medical Medium Blog. FOR 3-7 DA YS AFTER A BLOOD DRA W: Continue with the preparation steps above. Add cucumber juice in the afternoon or evening to help restore red blood cells. Eat at least 2-3 apples a day . Eat plenty of papayas and bananas to replenish potassium and glucose reserves. SUPPLEMENTS FOR BEFORE AND AFTER A BLOOD DRA W: Vitamin C\u2014helps to rebuild immune system Liquid zinc sulfate\u2014supports the immune system and keeps viruses at bay Liquid B12\u2014promotes recovery from the shock of a blood draw Magnesium glycinate De-Str ess To conti nue on the path of welln ess, it is essential to maintain a healthy diet, but decreasing stress, both environmental and emotional, is a crucial part of the healing process. Living in the 21st century is undoubtedly challenging at times, and it is almost impossib le to eliminate stress entirely from our lives. A small amount of stress can be usefu l, especially when we find ourselves in situations that require us to be alert and ready to take action. But stress is a problem when it becomes chronic. When we consistently wake up day in and day out feeling strung out, anxious, and beaten down bylife. When we go to bed at night worrying about things that keep us awake all night, or when we are so stressed and exhausted, we let our frustrations out on our kids and spouses. Stress triggers a cascade of horm ones and a wide range of physiological responses. During a fight or flight response, your heart beats faster , increasing your blood pressure, your respiratory rate increases, increasing alertness and glucose, and fats get released from temporary storage sites in your body , which flood your bloodstream, supplying energy to all parts of your body so that you can either fight or take flight. Chronic activation of this survival mechanism weakens your immune system, which can be detrimenta l to all aspects of your health. Whether you are suffering from acute stress or chronic stress, your adrenal glands respond to stressful situations by releasing the hormones adrenaline, cortisol, and norepinephrine. Stress hormones are corrosive to your liver, and they feed the bugs that are holding you hostage and keeping you unwell. Emotional stress can come from a taxing or toxic relationship with a spouse, romantic partner , relative, friend, co-worker , boss, or in-law . Stress could manifest at work or within your chosen career or lack of a career . Stress could come from losing your job, being the boss of a company , running a business, or it could arise out of a fear of financial loss or not having enough money to survive. Stress can also arise from unres olved past trauma, fear-based thoughts, and worries that run on automatic replay . It could arise from a change of life situation, moving to a new house or a breakup. It could come from the death of a loved one or pet. It could also come from suffering from a chronic illness or injury , experi encing a traumatic event, taking care of a family member , or being stuck in a traf fic jam. Stress could also come from unwittingly living in a home that is filled with toxic mold. Whether it be work pressure, family difficulties, or traffic jams, it is important to know how to stay calm and relaxed when under emotional stress. I can remember how I felt when I returned to New Zealand after living in a state of poverty during a humanitarian crisis in Nepal for six months. All the worries I used to have were no longer significant. I felt so gratefulfor havin g light, power , hot water, limitless food, and a comfy bed. So, ask yourself if what you are stressing about now will be worth stressing over in a year. If the answer is no, then it's probably not worth a change of hormones and a decline in health! As I mentioned above, let's not forget about environmental toxins, which are also detrimental to our health. Environmental toxins weaken your immune system and allow pathogens to take hold. They are a number one trigger and are often at the root of chronic illness. THESE INCLUDE: Radiation, from airplane travel, CT scans, X-rays, cellphones and other technological devices, MRI' s, PET scans, and continual atmospheric fall out from past nuclear disasters Industrial pollution Pharmaceuticals Chlorine DDT Food chemicals Rainfall exposure (contaminated with chemtrails) Fluoride Chemical fertilizers Chemical solvents and solutions Diesel fuel Engine oil and grease Dioxins Exhaust fumes Gas grills, stoves, and ovens Gasoline and kerosene Paint and paint thinners Lacquer Lighter fluid Plastics Herbicides Pesticides Larvicides Smoke exposure Fumes from pumping gas at the petrol station. Mold Carpet chemicals Insecticides Fungicides on new furniture, clothes, and cars. Chemicals in conventional beauty products, conventional cleaning products, air fresheners, perfumes, conventional body products, colognes, after shave, hair dyes, scented candles, dry cleaning chemicals, spray tans, colognes, etc. Toxic heavy metals in our water , soil, air , medications, and products we use. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE T O AVOID EXPOSURE T O ENVIRONMENT AL TOXINS, HOWEVER, THERE ARE STEPS YOU CAN TAKE TO REDUCE YOUR EXPOSURE: Consider reducing your exposure to harmful electromagnetic frequencies by switching your W i-Fi of f at night before you go to bed, setting your phone to airplane mode or installing a device in your home that protects you from electromagnetic pollution. For a cost-ef fective alternative, leave a potato out and throw it away every 5-7 days. Potatoes are great at absorbing electromagnetic frequencies. Buy or ganic food where possible. Wear a mask or ensure you're standing upwind when pumping your gas. Use natural cleaning products and wash all new clothes before you wear them. Avoid using air fresheners or wearing perfumes and colognes. Consider switching the products you use in your home and on your body to natural, toxic-free alternatives. Once you identify your stress source, you can make the necessary lifestyle adjustments or apply some techniques to promote relaxation. One of the best ways to tackle stress and avoid all of that excess adrenaline from being released into your body is to allow yourself the time to take rest if your life has become too busy by going outside, reconnecting with the earth, and soaking up the healing rays of the sun. Taking a trip and filling your lungs with fresh air is sometimes all you need. The body is a complex system that is continuously carrying out functions to maintain homeostasis, and it has an amazing way of telling us when something is not quite right in our external environment by creating dysfunction within the body . Giving yourself time to rest and reflect quite often illuminates what is causing your stress and ill health so that you can take the necessary steps to create the right environment conducive to healing. Meditation, yoga, and pranay ama (breathing techniques) are great antidotes for stress, and you don't need to be a yogi to utilize them, anyonecan. Surrounding yourself with a close network of people who are supportive of your choices is also a crucial step to healing. OTHER STRESS TECHNIQUES THA T I FIND WORK WONDERS ARE: Soaking in a hot bath Swimming in the ocean Listening to relaxing music Drinking a cup of lemon balm tea Engaging in an activity that brings joy If you feel lonely , branching out and taking up a new hobby can create opportunities to meet like-minded people, or you may need to simply take the time to reconnect with yourself or the ones you love. After all, health begins within, and your body is the only real vehicle you have in life. If you focus on loving yourself and taking care of your body , you can live a symptom free and happy life. \"It is health that is the real wealth, and not pieces of gold and silver.\" - MAHA TMA GANDHI.m CHAPTER EIGHT The Seven Pillars of Health ost of us know if we want to feel energized and healthy , we must eat a good diet, exercise, and drink plenty of water . But is illness avoidable, and how does disease manifest? My background as a NES health bioener getics practitioner has given me a new understanding into the science of energy and information within the body . Bioener getics merges physics, bio photonics, quantum biology , and quantum physics, which all tell us there is much more to our body and the world around us than we realize. Science tells us that we are made up of electrons, protons, and neutrons, which cluster together to form the human body' s cells, tissues, and organs. Energy is fundamental to life. W ithout it, we would not survive. As Einstein famously said, \"The field is the sole governing agency of the particle.\" It is ener gy that gives rise to matter . Atoms form cells, cells form tissues, tissues form organs, and all organ systems and networks located in between generate their own electrical field in your body . We are nothing more than a complex energetic system with a human body exterior! The truth is the body' s physiolo gical processes need energy to carry out their physiological functions to maintain homeostasis. Without energy, our cells would not be able to perform the necessary tasks to keep us alive.Therefore, it is our energetic system that is the master control system of our phys iology , and if we focus on strengthening the body' s energy field, we can experience better health. However , when it comes to health, most people are not aware that they have an energetic system, and their energetic health is overlooked because energy is not tangible and it can't be seen, but it doesn' t mean that it does not exist. People often search for years trying to find answers to why they are chronically ill, they never disco ver why, and their symptoms often fall into the category of mystery illness or autoimmune. What if I were to tell you that maybe our ancient healing traditio ns had it right? Perhaps our health care system is not working for so many people because the medical establishm ent does not take into accoun t the human body-field, nor does it acknowledge that we are multidimensional beings. What Exactly is the Human Body-Field? In bioener getics, the body-field , which is similar to the aura, consists of trillions of energetic fields that arise from the cells, tissues, organs, and systems of the human body , which together form the body-field as a whole. Physics tells us that all matter is made of subatomic particles, and subatomic particles emit energy fields, so it makes sense that our bodies also contain energy fields. The human body-field is a complex, self-or ganizing, innately intelligent structure in space, and the energy of that structure is sometimes referred to as quantum energy. A strong body-field represents the cell, tissue, organ, or system' s ability to function as a cohesive whole. Fascinating, right! Nature has designed us to be so much more than just our physical body , and when given the correct operating instructions and boost of ener gy, everyone has the ability to heal. You might be wondering how to increase your energy and strengthen your body-field, or if it is even possible? Well, let me tell you it is. On a macro level, we gain energy from sources in our environment, and that energy contributes to our overall body-field strength, so we certainly can use these sources to increase energy and resistance to illness and disease.If we go even deeper , our entire body has various interconnected pathways for energy and inform ation to flow. Information is what directs every biological process in your body . If one field becomes weak, or if the message becomes scrambled, it affects all the various cells, tissues, organs, and subsystems that share the same pathway , often resulting in chronic illness or disease. For example, the large intestine meridian (ener gy channel) is one of the 12 main meridians in Traditional Chinese Medicine. If energy and information are not flowing correctly , health issues may arise within a system that shares the same energy pathway . A person with large intestine dysfunction may find that they also have problems within their autonomic nervous system or their ears, nose, throat, bronchi, and skin because they all share the same energetic pathw ay. Emotions such as holding on and letting go, fulfilment and frustration, hope and despair , and self-worth and guilt also play a role in the health of the lar ge intestine meridian. HEALING DOES NOT HAPPEN IN A LINEAR W AY, NOR DOES IT WORK WITHIN THE CONFINES OF TIME AND SP ACE. WE ARE MUL TIDIMENSIONAL BEINGS OF ENERGY , AND HEALING INVOLVES A MUL TIDIMENSIONAL PROCESS BEYOND OUR THREE-DIMENSIONAL REALITY . To Physically Experience Y our Energy , Try This Simple Exer cise: Close your eyes and place the palms of your hands together . Take a few deep breaths, and slowly separ ate your hands. Notice any sensations that arise between your palms. You might experience a tingling sensation, warmth, or a feeling that something is between your hands. Play around with it and notice if the sensations disappear the further you pull your hands apart. The sensations could be subtle, they could be noticeable, or you might not notice anything. This is all okay. You are simply experimenting with your energy and bringing your awareness to being able to feel it physically . You could also try this exercise with a friend, a partner , or a family member . The more you get comfortable with feeling and experiencing your energy, the more you can tap into an abundant flow of healing energy that is available to all of us. When we becom e sick, we usually visit the doctor , who often writes out a prescription for pharmaceutical drugs, or in some cases, we get referred to the hospital and the sur geon removes the body part that isn' t working. However , all too often, the prescription drugs cause nasty side-ef fects, which create a new set of symptoms, and the doctor usually prescribes another medication to counteract the effects of the original drug. Thus, the merry go round continues. Perhaps the medication has lessened the symptoms, making the disease more bearable. However , the patient becomes reliant on taking the drugbecause it does not heal the condition, or, even worse, the patient's liver is put under stress and the body becomes toxic from the buildup of the drugs. Some health care system, right? Natural medicin e has advanced since the days of doctors writing out prescriptions for antibiotics and pharmaceutical drugs, and many people with chronic diseases are turning toward more natural and holistic approaches when it comes to their health. Mainstream medicine has taught us that biochemistry controls everything in our body; however , if the biochemical model was accurate, how can it explain specific physiological processes that happens almost instantaneously . What is driving those processes? Quantum physics tells us that the human body-field is the energetic bluep rint that creates the human form , and every human being and all biological organisms have such a blueprint. Your body- field processes and coordinates energy and information throughout your body and your health depends on the proper flow and communication of information throughout the information networks, which we know as the Chinese Meridian System. Now that we know we have a body-field, which is the master control system of our biochemistry and physiological processes, we can begin to look at health and healing in a new way . This means that the old ways of treating disease with prescription drugs, removing body parts, and suffering from mystery illnesses and chronic health issues are things of the past! We now have a new unde rstanding of the emer ging field of bioener getics. Healing is a process that happens within our body . It does not come from the outside. But it does depend on your body-field' s ability to exchange information and ener gy. Energy and the Exchange of Information Research carried out by Peter Fraser tells us that energy and information cannot exist without the other; they are two sides of the same coin. Our body-field gains energy from sources in our environment, and our body stores the energy in the three main cavities in the body : the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavitie s. Our organs and body systems draw upon this reservoir of energy to carry out their energetic processes, whileinformation for our biochemical and physiological processes flows through pathways that are similar to the Chinese Meridian system via connective tissues. Another important thing to understand is all of the emot ional trauma that you have ever been exposed to throughout your life gets stored as oscillations in the brain, which often manifests as physical symptoms. One way of understanding information is to imagine travelling on a train. To board, you need a ticket, however , it is not the ticket that tells the operator where you want to travel. It is the information contained on the ticket. As Einstein describes: \"The information is the field, and the ticket is the particle.\" Without the correct information, you would not be able to arrive at your destination. To put it simply , information instructs our cells to carry out all the tasks necessary to keep us alive. How to Incr ease Y our Energy There are seven primary sources of energy in our environmen t, and if one source is lacking, it can throw the whole body out of balance. On a macro level, we gain energy from sources in our environment, and that energy contributes to the strength of our overall body-field. On a micro- level, each cell, tissue, and or gan of the human body contains a field. The body' s physiological proces ses need energy and information to carry out their physiological functions to maintain homeostasis. Without energy and the correct information, our cells would not perform the necessary tasks to keep us alive. Health problems arise when your body-field becomes contaminated by environmental toxins, including electromagnetic pollution, chem ical toxins, emotional traumas, physical traumas, negative thought patterns, parasites, viruses, fungus, sur gery, and poor food choices. Everything we consume, both physically and mentally , can have consequences, and those consequences can be supportive of our health or degrade it. If you have hit a wall in your healing, it might be a sign that you need to dig deep er and address the health of your energetic system. If you energize your body-field by correcting the energetic blockages and distortions in information transfer , you can experience better health and heal.Let's now look at the seven sources of energy that your body uses to maintain and increase energy according to the emer ging science of bioener getics. Diet No surprises here! Your body gains energy from the food you eat by breaking down molecules in food. Suppose we fuel our body with a high fat, highly processed diet. In that case, it puts stress on our digestive system, and the energy gained through nutrition is used to digest the food. When we don't fuel our body with the right food, it creates a sluggish feeling. Food is meant to increase energy, not take energy, so, the next time you eat, ask yourself, \"Will this food give me energy or use energy?\" Plant-based food contains its own energy fields because plants are living organisms. Animal foods contain adrenaline from the animal' s fear before it was slaughtered. When we nourish ourselves with plenty of fruits, leafy greens, and vegetables, we automatically increase our life force ener gy. Hydration Ninety-nine percent of the tissues in your body are made up of water molecules. We know that H20 is the chemical formula for water , however , cutting-edge research has identi fied a fourth phase of water , a gel-like fluid that lines all the cells of your body, turning it into a battery . The gel acts as a conduit, and it stores and transmits information, which fuels your mitochondria\u2014your cells' ener gy generator . This fourth stage of water , often called structured water , has the most significant impact on your energy of any single molecule in your body . There are two ways you can benefit from structured water: by positively impacting the gel in your cells and from drinking structured water . HERE ARE A FEW WAYS TO STRUCTURE YOUR WATER BEFORE DRINKING IT : 1. Expose your water to sunlight. 2. Add electrolytes such as lemon or limes. 3. Choose glacial, mineral, spring, or artesian water that is bottled in glass. Movement Have you ever noticed how people who exercise seem to have more energy than those who don't? They have more energy because regular exercise deliver s energy by flooding the body with all-important oxygen. Exercise also protects us from disease by reducing chronic inflammation and oxidative damage. So, consider introducing some form of movement or exercise into your life. This could be going for a walk, riding a bike, taking a hike, swimming, surfing, yoga, or playing a sport. If you are chronically ill and lack the energy to exercise, think about low impact movement practices like restorative yoga or rebounding without your feet leaving the mat. Oxygenation Ninety percent of your energy comes from oxygen, making oxyg en a key player in health, yet many of us don't breathe properly , and we aren' t even aware of it. Breathing happens without any conscious effort approximately 18 times per minute, 1080 times an hour and 25,920 times a day. Stress and emotional factors commonly cause shallow breathing, which plays a huge role in restricting your ability to take in long, deep breaths. If you think about it, one of the first things we do when we become stressed or fearful is take small, short breaths as if we are avoiding taking in life itself. Good oxygen is fundamental for our survival, without it, our cells would not survive. Sub-optimal oxygen delivery can affect your energy, focus, mood, and ability to feel well and healthy . Viruses also thrive in environments that lack oxygen. So, if you live in a city, consider taking regular time out in nature to fill your lungs with clean, fresh oxygen. Oxygen is crucial for brain and nervous system function. It strengthens the cardiovascular system, rejuvenates your glands and hormones, boosts your immune system, helpsyou clear waste products and toxins from your system, and helps you to digest and absorb food. Good breathing begins with awareness, so check in with your breath regularly . Obser ve if your breathing changes in different situations and environments, and practice taking long, deep, slow breaths, Drawing the breath right down into your belly and in and out through your nose. Day/night Cycles Our bodies respond to the presen ce or absence of sunlight. Depending on the time of day and the exposure to light, our cells utilize different mechanisms to store and produce energy. During the day, sunlight is our primary source of energy. At nighttime, our cells use stored energy from fats to produce heat in the form of infrared light to keep us warm. Both sunlight and heat are used by the body to charge water at the hydrophili c surfaces of proteins and cell membranes. The water in our cells and the matrix surrounding them acts like a liquid battery that can store ener gy. Not getting enough natural daylight from spending too much time indoors can cause an energy deficit. Shift work can also disrupt the natural day/night rhyth m, which can harm your overall health. Getting a good night' s sleep is essential when you want to heal. Polarity and Gr ounding Polarity relates to an all-encompassing electromagnetic field, and for optimal health, it should hold a slightly negative charge. All the chemical activity in your body , including the heart and nervous system, generate an electromagnetic charge. More importantly , a good electromagnetic charge held across the cell membrane gives us energy and vitality and allows for a good flow of information into and out of our cells. When polarity loses charge or move s toward a more positive charge, there can be a significant disruption to the body' s ener gy fields and the body itself. Polarity can be distorted by electromagnetic pollution such as radio waves, X-rays, air travel, cellphones, computers, Wi-Fi, electrical wires, smart meters, power lines, and cellphone towers.Grounding, or earthing, which requires your bare skin to be in direct contact with the earth, is a powerful way to maintain a negativ e charge that is so important to health. Alignment to Earth' s Electr omagnetic Fields There are three primary axes within the Earth' s Big Field: the vertical, equatorial, and magnetic polar axes. These axes cross through the midline of your body , slightly to the left where your heart is located. We know the heart has a powerful electromagneti c field, which plays an impo rtant role in communicating information to and from our brain and cells, and cell membranes serve as a receiver and transmitter for environmental signals. Scientific resear ch has shown that our cells are tuned into their environment and the earth field's three axes' energies, and things can go wrong when the body is misaligned with one or more of these axes. Information can go awry , and we can feel of f-balance, dizzy , or not securely in our body . The effects of not being energetically grounded can cause flightiness, disor ganization, scattered thoughts, lack of focus, impatience, and erratic emotions. To restore your alignment to the earth' s magnetic fields, consider reducing your exposure to harmful electromagnetic frequencies and ground yourself to the earth' s magnetic field by bare skin to earth contact. If the levels of health and wellness we experience are rooted in the strength and function of our body-field, which is a complex interconnected web of energy and information , it may account for why so many people worldwide are struggling to be well within a health system that is not designed to look at the root causes of illness and disease, because health begins in your body-field. Emotional and physical trauma can also be imprinted into your body- field and oscillate, causing various health symptoms until it is resolved. This information is important if you have tried everything to heal and you are still so unwell that you can barely function. All your life experiences and everything you have ever put into and onto your body gets stored within your body-field. That is why healing can take time. It is like peeling back layers of an onion one at a time. When I was undertaking my NES Health training, I was taught one layer of onionrepresents seven years of your life. So, it makes sense the older we get, the more health issues we seem to have. It is not only toxins and pathogens that are keep ing us sick, but we are also accumulating years of trauma in our body-fields, which are distorting it. To recognize if past trauma is holding you back from optimal health, try to remem ber when your illness, disease or symptom first appeared. Suppose you can correlate it to a situation, event, or circumstance that happened around the same time. In that case, it suggests you may need to focus your healing on releasing trauma. There are many effective trauma-based healing modalities. Energy healing is one. I highly recommend seeking the help of a qualified health practitioner who can help you. Now that you are armed with the right information and underst and your body' s miraculo us workings, you can ensure your body gains energy from the right source s in your enviro nment, which is often the missing link that activates healing. It sadde ns me to see people getting caught on the merry-go- round of health practition ers, diets, programs, and supplements. I have been there myself. I spent so much money because I was desperate to find that miracle. That one thing that would pull me out of the ashes of suffering with chronic illness. For many years I search ed for answers, looking for relief from my relentless sympt oms. I couldn' t work, and the stress of being in financial hardship contributed to my ill health. PLEASE KNOW THA T YOU CAN HEAL. IT IS YOUR BIRTHRIGHT! YOUR MIRACULOUS BODY WOULD NEVER TURN ITS BACK ON YOU OR DECEIVE YOU. WHEN YOU GIVE YOUR BODY WHA T IT NEEDS T O THRIVE, AND WHEN YOU SUPERCHARGE IT WITH AN ABUNDANT FLOW OF ENERGY , YOUR ORGANS ARE ABLE T O CARR Y OUT THEIR LIFE-GIVING FUNCTIONS, AND YOUR CELLS CAN TRANSFER THE CORRECT MESSAGES THA T YOUR BODY SO DESPERA TEL Y NEEDS T O HEAL ITSELF . If the levels of health and wellness we experience are rooted in the strength and function of our body-field, it may account for why so many people worldwide are struggling to be well within a health system that does not acknowledge the root cause of illness and disease. The same health system that makes billions of dollars every year from prescription drugs. What is more alarming is that the health industry is one of the biggest industries in the world. In May 2017, Consumer News and Business Channel reported that the U.S. is on track to increase its expenditure on pharmaceutical drugs by seven percent, making a whopping $610 billion per year by 2021. With a vast array of mixed messages within the natural health industry , along with the disconnection of conventional medicine from the whole person, it may be hard to know where to start to regain your health. The most critical step you can take right now is responsibility for your health by ensuring your body gains energy from the right sources in your environment. Your quality-of-life stems from the levels of health that you experience. A pain-free, disease-free, health y mind and body contributes to a total state of wellbeing, making it the single most important investment you can make in life. I believe in you. Y our body has the ability to heal. Y ou can heal. \"You yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love and affection.\" - BUDDHA.I CHAPTER NINE Practicing Self-Care f you are anythi ng like me, prioritizing time for yourself and practicing self-care may not come easy. Being a single mother did not allow me the time or money to invest in myself, however , it is such an important component of self-esteem and overall wellbeing. In fact, research ers have discovered that those who practice self-care are more likely to feel happier , contain higher levels of resilience, and are less likely to develop mental health issues such as depression and anxiety and are more likely to experience an improvement in their relationships. So, as clich\u00e9 as it might sound , if practicing self-care is so important, why do many of us struggle with it? Trauma can impact our ability to care, love, and nurture ourselves. This is where self-care overlaps with the mental component of wellness. As a child, I experienced the world as being scary and unsafe. I learned that to get my needs met, I had to be good, quiet, and passive to not disturb the delic ate balance within my family . As a result, I suffered from severe anxiety and phobias. My parents didn' t understand why I felt scared and insecure most of the time. It was an emotional response which didn' t make sense in their minds, so my feelings weren' t validated or ackno wledged. As a result, I was told \"stop being silly\", and I learned to doubt myself and what I felt.As children, our well-being and how we end up seeing the world as adults are mainly in our parents ' and caregivers' hands. We look up to them as gods, and as well-meaning as most of them are, how they love, care, and nurture us will influence how we care for ourselves. As a little girl, I squashed my feelings down, which resulted in anxiety , and I tried to be good, to feel loved, accepted, and safe. Fast forward a few years, and this same scenario would play out in my romantic relationships. Unfortunately , I learned not to trust myself, and I put my partner's needs before mine because, as paradoxical as it might sound, that is how I got my needs met as a child. We all grow up playing out different roles within our family system in order to be seen, heard, loved, and accepted, however , as adults we can become stuck in a trauma loop because we don't recognize the patterns and roles that we assigned ourselves to in childhood. We stay in relationships that are not supportive to our wellbeing because we are subconsciously trying to get our needs met, which were not met as a child. The thing is, we are consciously aware of time and space and the here and now, but sub-consciously we are still living out our childhood wounds, and quite often we do this within romantic relationships. RELA TIONSHIPS ARE LIKE MIRRORS. WHA TEVER YOU SEE, FEEL, OR THINK IS REFLECTED BACK T O YOU, EVEN THE RELA TIONSHIP YOU HA VE WITH YOURSELF . WITHOUT SELF- AWARENESS, YOU WILL CONTINUE T O ATTRACT INT O YOUR LIFE WHA T YOU BELIEVE IN YOUR SUBCONSCIOUS MIND. It is difficult to feel content, whether alone or in a love relationship, without first loving and accepting yourself. After all, the one person who isguaranteed to be in your life forever is you, therefore, we must nurture and love ourselves. When we view the self as worthy, valuable, and deserving of love and happiness, we invite into our life all that is healthy and good. So, it is time to discard the old belief that it's selfish to put ourselves first and begin to love and take care of ourselves. When we truly love ourselves, we naturally begin to feel whole, and we are less likely to attract into our lives situations, relationships, or circumstances that are not for our highest good. 20 Steps to Practicing Self-Love: 1. Cr eate a Self-love ritual Put aside regular time to unplug from social media, work, social engagements, or anything that distracts you from being with yourself to pamper yourself. Pampering yourself could mean soaking in a hot bath, lighting some candles, and listening to relaxing music, giving yourself a facial, manicure, pedicure, or anything that nurtures you and brings you satisfaction. 2. Start W riting a Journal Writing can be powerfully healing. It brings forth the opportunity for self-reflection, and it can help to release old hurts. 3. Clean Out Let go of clothes or things in your house that you no longer use and have a garage sale or donate the items to charity . Often when we de-clutter our environment, we create space for something new to enter . 4. Adopt Positive Thinking Begin each day by telling yours elf something positive. Practice positive self-talk rather than negative self-talk.5. Nourish Y ourself Fill your body with nourishing food that brings you energy makes you healthy . 6. Stop Comparisons Stop comparing yourself to others! Instagram and Facebook are often misleading, and they do not portray the full picture. The person who appears to have it all may deep down feel insecure and unhappy . 7. Celebrate Y ou Celebrate your achievements, however small or insignificant you deem them to be and acknowledge how far you have come. 8. Build Healthy Relationships Surround yourself with people who love and encourage you and let go of toxic people in your life. Focus on building a healthy , supportive network of people around you who lift you up rather than bring you down. 9. Try Something New Step outside your comfort zone and try something new. Perhaps you have always wanted to learn how to dance, play the guitar , or speak a new language. 10. Let Go Let go of past trauma and wounds by forgiving yourself and others. For example, write a letter to someone who hurt you and then burn it or pick up the phone and call someone you would like to make amends with. Forgiving someone does not mean what they did was right. It frees you and enables you to move forward in life. 11. Accept Y ourself Embrace the things about you that make you unique and begin to love the parts of yourself that you dislike.12. Follow Y our Passions Live intentionally , allow yourself to do what you love and trust that the universe has your back. 13. T ake Regular T ime Out Don' t depend on others for company , instead; take regular time out in nature to breathe, take yourself out to a movie, or treat yourself to dinner . 14. Be Mindful Be mindful of what you think, feel, and want in life and live-in ways that reflect this. 15. Practice Gratitude Each day think of at least three things you are grateful for and allow gratitude to fill your heart. 16. Set Boundaries Set healthy boundaries by developing clear communication to say what you want to say and learn how to say no. When we truly value and respect ourselves, we won' t allow others to use or abuse us. 17. Expr ess Y our Cr eativity Allow yourself the time to discover or express your creativity . 18. Be Realistic We are designed to experience and express a full range of emot ions. It is unrealistic to think we should be happy every day. We have all had different life experiences, and at some point in our lives, we have all made mistakes, but this is how we learn and grow . It is okay to feel a range of different emotions, after all, we are only human. 19. PRACTICE GOOD SELF-CARE The body is a vehicle for our soul, we only have one body , and if we wish to go a long distance, we need to take care of it by givin g it the rightingredients it needs to thrive. 20. Play Often Don' t sweat the small stuff! Express yourself in whatever ways are meaningful to you, allow yourse lf to be you without feeling like you have to be someone you are not, and laugh often! Practice light-hearted ness and try not to carry the weight of the world on your shoulders. We are all in this game we call life together , and none of us are getting out alive anyway , so live according to your own rules and enjoy the ride! \"Let food be thy medicine and medicine be thy food.\" - HIPPOCRA TES.g CHAPTER TEN 47 Easy Plant-Based Recipes etting proper nutrition is crucial if we want to feel healthy . Most people have taken some form of vitamin or mineral supplement, and although they are useful to address deficiencies, they will never have the phytonutrients found in nature. In fact, most vitamin C supplements are synthetically manufactured in labs. You simply cannot compare it to a freshly picked orange, which contains all the highly bioavail able co-factors that help with assimilation and absorption. Modern life has become so busy that most people have become disconnected from the earth and are not getting enough nutritio n from their food. Soils nowadays are heavily deficient in minerals that are vital to our health, and packaged foods lack the enzymes, vitamins, and phytochemicals that fresh fruits and vegetables have. Eating packaged, processed, and fast foods can be appealing if you live a busy lifestyle; however , they are often high in sugar and trans fats, most of the ingredients are made from genetically modified organism s, and they are filled with toxic chemicals, artificial flavors, colors, preservatives, and sweeteners. The food we eat has a direct correlation to how we feel, and if we want to feel strong and healthy , fight disease and heal from chronic health issues, we must make sure what we are eating reflects our desire to feel good.The average American diet consists of bread, pastries, pasta, meat, dairy , soda, processed sugar , and vegetables that are served as small side dishes. If we want to be healthie r, we need to expand our culinary skills and start getting more creative in the kitchen! Cooking can be fun, and there is nothing more satisfying than knowing what you are putting into your and your loved one' s tummies will pay dividends in years to come. The one thing I looked forward to when visiting my mother was her delicious, wholesome home cooking. I always returned home feeling so good, and I put it down to all the raw vegan food she fed me. My mother 's food was made from organic produce, which was picked fresh from her garden, and being organic meant the fruit, veget ables, leafy greens, and herbs contained the maximum levels of nutrients without the harmful herbicides and pesticides. Eating organical ly grown foods is the only way to avoid consuming all those nasty chemicals that are sprayed onto commercially grow n food. Not only are you saving yourself from ingesting harmful chemical s when you eat organic food, but you are also consuming more nutrients than commercially grown food. The Journal of Alternative and Com plementary Medicine conducted a review of 41 published studies comparing the nutritional value of organically grown and conventionally grown fruits, vegetables, and grains. It conclu ded that there are signif icantly more of several nutrients in organic foods crops. The study verifies that five servings of organically grown vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, carrots, potatoes, and cabbage provide an adequate allowance of vitam in C, whereas the same number of servings of conventionally grown vegetables did not. On average, organically grown foods provide 21.1% more iron than their conventional counterparts, 27% more vitamin C, 29.3% more magnesium, and 13.6% more phosphorus, making organic foods superior in nutrition. I hope this information provides you with enough reason to switch to locally grown organic produce if you aren' t already eating organic. If spending extra money is holding you back from switching over because it's simply unaffordable for you to do so, then you might want to consider swapping the fruits and vege tables that contain the highest levels of pesticide residue.Anthony William recommend s prioritizing organic potatoe s, leafy greens, strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, and grapes over conventional, as they absorb the highest amounts of toxins. Another key thing to know is, quite often, organic farmers spray a waxy film that contains monosodium glutamate on apples, cucumbers, and tomatoes, so it is best to wash them. If you love peas, it is best to buy organic because they have fallen into the same category as corn and are contam inated with genetically modified or ganisms. My mother has always been my inspiration when it comes to food. She taught me the importance of eating a whole foods organic diet and that healthy cooking can be easy and delicious! I hope the follo wing recipes will give you some inspiration and new ideas for wholesome vegan cooking.

Everything that we put onto our skin gets absorbed, so it makes sense to ensure that what we are putting onto our bodies is natural and safe. Items such as makeup, beauty products, skincare, haircare, soaps, body wash, toothpaste, deodorant, sunscreen, pharmaceutical medicines, household cleaners, insect sprays, repellants, air freshene rs, garden fertilizers, weed killers, dental amalgam fillings, scented candles, and tap water all contain a concoction of poisonous chemicals and toxic heavy metals, which can build up in the body and create illness and disease. You are probabl y well aware that parabens in your skincare products or the chem icals in your household products are dangerous if ingested, but the truth is that much of what we put onto our skin is absorb ed into our bloodstream. In fact, on average women add more than 200 chemicals to their skin daily , and more than 60 percent of these chemicals get absorbed directly into the bloodstream. While some chemicals are too lar ge to penetrate, many are small enough to enter our bloodstream. We also need to be wary of inhaling toxic chemicals such as chlorine vapors in a hot shower , and household spray on cleaners like oven cleaner .Interestingly , a study published in 2005 by The Envir onmental Working Group found toxic chemicals in the umbilical cord blood of newborn babies born in the U.S. They screened for more than 400 chemicals, and an astounding 287 toxins were detected within the umbilical cord blood of these newborns. Of these 287 chemicals, 217 were neurotoxins, and 208 are known to damage growth development or cause congenital disabilities. These toxins included mercury and pesticides. The sad thing is the media has lar gely ignored these study results. It may be overw helming to think of replacing all of the items you would normally use in favor of natural alternatives, so you might want to start slowly and strategically . Think about the items you use most often or items that stay on your skin and don't get washed off, such as moisturizers and sunscreen, and eliminate them first. Shampoos and conditioners are also items that I would recommend removing immediately as they tend to wash over your whole body in the shower or bath. Top 10 Chemical Ingr edients to A void Like the Plague PARABENS To elevate your vibration to a higher level of love, peace, joy, and gratitude, create a daily morning ritual that sets the right tone for the rest of the day.

Natural T ravel Hacks: I have spent countless hours travelling and a lot of time living in third world countries, and I never became sick. I also decided against getting vaccinated, although there was a high risk of contracting mosquito-borne viruses and diseases throughou t my travels around Asia. How ever, I did take all of the necessary steps to avoid mosquito-borne illness es and food poisoning. I used natural insect repellant, I wore long-sleeved tops and pants at dusk and dawn, and I avoided eating raw, uncooked foods, and drinking water . However , my friends and family were always amazed at my good health, and they would often ask me, \"How did you avoid getting sick when you lived in India and Nepal?\" Countries that are notorious for food poisoning! Here are my secr ets: 1. Sovereign Silver boosts your immune system, and it is a powerful weapon against a wide range of illnesses, because it kills bacteria, virus, fungi, and parasites on contact. Instead of gettingvaccinations, which often comes with a list of unwanted side effects, try taking Sovereign Silver every day , including one month before travelling to help build your immune system. 2.

Oil of oregano capsules work wonders to treat and prevent tummy upsets. The powerful anti-microbial properties make it an excellent guard against food poisoning. I took one oil of oregano capsule after eating every meal out. I hope this chapter has given you some new ideas on how to reduce and eliminate toxins in your everyday life. It is essential to create an environment inside the body that is unsupportive to pathogens because pathogens are accountable for most chronic illnesses, and they thrive on bodily tissues that contain toxins. When we reduce our toxic load, we are one step closer to becoming well again. \"Yoga is not a religion. It is a science, science of well-being, science of youthfulness, science of integrating body, mind, and soul.\" - AMIT RA YY CHAPTER TWELVE How to Develop a Home-Based Yoga Practice oga has numerous health benef its for your mind, body , and spirit. We know that yoga postures stretch muscles, tone internal organs, and increase strength and flexibility , but you might not know the ancient yoga texts of Patanjali describe yoga postures as a tool to gain absolute peace of mind, which leads to self-realization or enlightenment. Reaching enligh tenment is probably not your goal, however; it is important to understand the origins of yoga before diving into asana (yoga postures) because it helps to cultivate a well-rounded practice. In Hatha Yoga, yoga means the union of prana (upward and inward flow of ener gy) and apana (downward and outward flow of energy) through the inhalation and exhalation of the breath. It is believed that when prana and apana flow together throug h the central passage of the spinal column (sushumna) to the top of the head, the experience of samadhi takes place. In Kundalini Yoga, yoga means the union of Shiva (masculine energy) and Shakti (feminine ener gy) to experience samadhi. Whatever the yoga path, style, or system, if it does not incorpo rate the underlying truths set out in Patanjali' s yoga sutras, it probably isn' t yoga.I was introduced to yoga at the age of four by my parent' s guru, but it wasn' t until I reached my twenties that I became interested in asana. The classes I attended and the teachers I studied under didn' t resonate with me, and I felt someth ing was missing. I longed for something deeper , something more than just carrying out phys ical postures and being guided like I was in an exercise class. I intuitively knew I wasn' t getting what I needed from the yoga classes I attended, so I started to practice at home. Without a teacher or any anatomical cues, I journeyed into myself where I listened to my own body and breath. It was here that I realised I didn' t need a teacher to tell me how to 'do' yoga. I finally found something that I could turn to during the lowest point in my life. Yoga became my go to friend that I could always rely upon, and it helped me transition through a lot of difficult life situations. If I was upset, I practiced becaus e it made me forget about whatever was causin g me to feel sad, and it broug ht me back to the present. If I doubted myself , I practiced because it gave me a sense of achievement each time I improved. If I felt tired, anxious, or overwhelmed, I practiced to reduce a buildup of stress from everyday life pressures. When I struggled with chronic health issues, I turned to specific restorative postures and breathing techniques, which helped me navigate my healing journey . Yoga played an important part in my healing, and it connected me to my true self. After developing a home-based practice, becoming a yoga teacher , and guiding others toward the path of yoga, I realised that the essence of yoga was missing from many weste rn yoga classes, which leaned toward the physical aspects of yoga. So, to embody the true essence of yoga, I developed a unique system that incorporated six stages of practice. If you have been considering learning yoga but can't afford to take classes, if you live far from a yoga studio, or you feel intimidated to go to a yoga class, this chapter will teach you how to safely develop a yoga practice from the comfort of your home. What is Y oga? The word yoga means union. Union with individual consciousness or the soul and union with universal consciousness or God. It is essentially therealisation of your true, divine nature, which is a part of the existential whole. In yogic philosophy , all matter in the universe arises from prakriti , and three innate qualities called gunas make up the balance of all that exists in the world. According to the Bhagavad Gita, we all have varying degrees of each guna, however , the goal of a yogi is to become sattvic , which means maintaining qualities of balance , harmony , and purity to obtain the higher stages of yoga that were set out in Patanjali' s yoga system. Patanjali gave us ethical and moral guidelines in the first two limbs, the yamas and niyamas, to balance the three gunas and reduce rajas (qualities of action, ego, drive, passion) and tamas (qualities of inaction, darkness, dullness of existence). A guna can be increased or decreased through the interact ion and influence of external objects, lifestyle practices, and thoughts. Yogis developed all the traditional yogic practices to create sattva in the mind and body . However , nowadays, yoga is practiced without any consideration to the true essence of yoga, and yoga postures are fitted into busy schedules. There is no right or wrong way to do yoga. Everybody finds yoga for different reasons, and they are all valid. There are also many styles and paths of yoga, and while most people attend a yoga class for yoga postures, it is essential to understand that asanas make up a small aspect of yoga. The difference between an exercise class and a yoga class is conscious breath and awareness of the mind. When we exercise, our heartrate increases and we increase rajas, however , traditional yoga aims to decrease the heartrate. It is believed that by reducing the heart rate, we can increase our life span. So, if the breath shortens and the heart rate increases during asana practice, it is a good indication to take rest unless your goal is to have a workout! When we practice conscious breathing with mindfulness, we are in a state of yoga. When we work out at the gym or perform any physical activity , we aren' t usually aware of our breath or our mind' s content. Performing yoga postures allows us to observe the mind and go inward, to connect with our true self, which is essentially a part of universal consciousness.Asanas then become dhyana or a moving meditation. Dhyana is the seventh limb of Patanjali' s yoga sutras and the gateway to the final limb, samadhi, which leads to kaivalya (liberation) and ultimate freedom. The reason breathing correctly is so important is because it increases prana throughout our body . Prana is the vital energy, which permeates the entire universe. It is that unseen force that gives life to all living beings, including animals, and plants. Without prana, we would not be alive. People with a lot of prana look youthful, vibrant, and they have an abun dant supply of energy. Their skin glows, and you feel good and uplifted being around them. People with less prana appear dull, their skin looks unhealthy , they lack ener gy, and you can feel drained when you are around them. It is also impor tant to understand chakras (ener gy centres) within the context of yoga. We have seven chakras that prana flows through, which run along our spine. The first chakra starts at the base of our spine, and the last chakra is at the crown of our head. Therefore, keeping the spine and neck aligned during yoga postur es is important. Just like water cannot flow through a hose with a kink in it, prana cannot flow through a bent, hunched up spine. When the spine is straight, and with correct breathing, prana can cleanse the chakras and remove any energetic blockages, which are often the precursor to physical illness and disease. As already mentioned in previous chapters, when we take care of our energetic health, we can experie nce better health, and the practic e of yoga is one way we can take care of our ener getic health. If you are put off by yoga because you think it is a religion, don't be. Yoga is a science, not a religion , and it is for everyone, regardless of age, religious beliefs, culture, background, body type, gender , or ethnicity . Yoga is a tool to healing, and if you have never practiced before, consider this a sign to start! In the following pages you are about to discover an ancient healing system that will support you along your healing path. Despite what you may have thought, practicing yoga doesn' t mean rolling out your mat for an hour each day and bending yourself like a pretzel into some outlandish posture. Being in a state of yoga might mean that you bring more mindfulness at work or during any activity that you are carrying out, or it could mean you practice a few rounds of pranayama (breathing techniques), or you sit and meditate.These simple techniques that I am about to share can easily be learned at home, so you don' t have to wait another day for a class or a teacher . DON'T BE FOOLED BY ALL OF THE SKIMPY YOGA A TTIRE, TRENDY FITNESS GEAR, AND PHOT OS FILLED WITH BIKINI- CLAD, PREDOMINANTL Y WHITE, SKINNY MODELS THA T ARE LITTERED ACROSS SOCIAL MEDIA THESE DA YS. YOU DO NOT NEED LULULEMON TIGHTS OR F ANCY PROPS. YOUR GURU LIES WITHIN, AND THE BEST TEACHER IS DIRECT EXPERIENCE! Here are the tools and techniqu es that I have learned over the past 20 years so you can develop a yoga practice that is meaningful to you. Guidelines for Asana Practice: Ensure your stomach and bowels are empty . Allow three hours after a heavy meal. Do not practice in direct sunlight, make sure the room is a suitable temperature, and remove yourself from potential distractions. Wear loose clothing that will not restrict breathing, digestion, or circulation. Do not hold the breath during asanas. The mouth should be closed throughout practice, and breathing is done through the nostrils. To avoid injury , do not force the body beyond its capacity . If pain is felt (it' s important to distinguish between pain that can cause harm or pain caused by stretching, which is safe), ease of f and find what feels right for your body . If exhaustion is felt, it indicates that you have been practising for too long or that the wrong postures have been attempted. It could also indicate a health issue, in which case, do restorative postures. Introduction to My 6 Stages of Practice: GROUNDING: Stage one involves centring and connecting in with your breath. This is the time to leave the stresses of the day and week behind and come into the present moment by feeling how you feel in your body and observing your thoughts in a non-judgemental way. After all, your thoughts determ ine how you feel! The connection made with yourself at the start enables you to go deeper into your practice. Asanas for grounding include Supta Baddha Konasana, Balasana, Baddha Konasa na under Asanas below for furth er instruction on how to ground yourself. PAWANMUKT ASANA SERIES ONE: I learned this practice while studying one-on -one with my yoga teacher in Nepal, and he instructed me to teach this before doing any yoga postures. The practice comes from the Satyananda lineage of yoga, which is a branch of Hatha Yoga. Pawan means air or wind, and Mukta means release. This practice gently warms up every joint and muscle in the body and prepares the body for asanas. Not only does the practice open up the joints, but it also warms up surrounding soft tissues, activates the flow of prana throughout the body , removes any blockages or stagnant air in the joints, and creates that all-important mind/body connection while promoting total health. ASANAS: Most people practice yoga for the physical aspects, including the obvious health benefits of increased flexibility and strength, toning the body , and massaging internal organs. Traditionally , asanas prepared the body for higher stages of yoga such as meditation and samadhi. If we think of our body as a conduit for prana and practice asanas with correct breathing and alignment, we can increase prana in the body and experience better health and wellbeing. See below for a full list of asanas. PRANA YAMA: Prana means life force or vital energy, and ayama means the extension of breath. Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, also known as alternate nostril breathing, is the fourth stage of practice. There are three parts: inhalation, exhalation, and breath retention. Breath retention is a more advanced practice, therefore, I recommend beginners start with inhalation and exhalation. The goal of pranayama is to increase the concentration of prana in the body . Each time we move, think, talk, or digest food, we use prana, and each time we inhale, we consume prana. On a cellular level, our body continuously carries out physiological functions each day to keep the body alive, and our cells cannot carry out these functions without energy or prana. Pranayama is also an essential component in Hatha Yoga. Ha means Sun and Tha means moon. It is our masculine/feminine, right-brain dominant/left-brain dominant, lunar/solar , alert/sleepy aspects. If the flow of prana through both sides (Ida and Pingala energy channels) is not in balance, we can feel alert when we want to sleep or sleepy when we want to meditate, work, or study . The practice of alternate nostril breathing balances out both sides. For example, you may notice that one nostril is more blocked when you breathe than the other . This indicates how you might be feeling. Learnin g Nadi Shodhana Pranayama can be particularly useful for those who suffer from insomnia. Both sides play an important role, but if you need to sleep at night, it won't be helpful if your left nostril is blocked or if you are trying to meditate and your right nostril is blocked. Practice: To test this for yourself, close your right nostril and gently breathe in through your left nostril, then close your left nostril and gently breathe in through your right nostril. See if one side is more blocked than the other. Some times the difference can be very subtle, other times it ismore noticeable . Try a few rounds of Nadi Shodhana Pranayam a and then do the same test at the end. You should notice that the airflow between both nostrils is even. For detailed instruction on Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, see the following chapter . SHAVASANA OR FINAL RELAXA TION: For some, this is the most challenging part of a yoga class. Being in stillness and silence can be uncomfortable, but it is an essential part of the practice, which is often overlooked. CHANTING: The final stage of practice involves chanting AUM and three Shanti' s to seal in the energies you cultivated. It also helps you connect to your practice in a deeper , more meaningful way . AUM is a sound vibration, and when chanted, it vibrates at the same frequency found throughout all of nature. It is the sound of the universe, and when it is chanted, you are physically tuning into that vibration. The vibration has a similar ef fect as meditation\u2014it calms the nervous system and mind. Shanti means peace, so, like AUM, when it is chanted, you are physically tuning into the vibration of peace. Traditionally , it is chanted three times. The first time, we are calling for peace in the unseen and divine forces. The second time is for our external world, such as wars, terrorism, racism, violence, or anything in your immediate environment. The third time is for our internal world to promote peace within oneself. Asanas The following asanas have been designed in a specific sequence to promote health, healing, and wellness. Alongside each asana is a chakra, a colour and a specific seed mantra that can be chanted while performing the asana. Each asana opens the corresponding chakra. Chanting the seed mantra associated with the chakra promotes healing and visualising the colour above the area of the corresponding chakra strengthens your ability to heal and connects you to your higher self. Always enter and exit an asana in unison with your breath and try to remain present, staying mindful of your thoughts while breathing deeply throughout your practice.Reclined Bound Angle Pose CHAKRA Lower abdomen, above the pubic bone and below your navel COLOR Orange SEED MANTRA VAM (Sounds like V OM)INSTRUCTIONS Lie flat on your back, bend your knees, bring both soles of the feet together toward your buttocks and gentl y allow both knees to fall out to the sides.

It is present in every single cell and atom of the universe. Everything that we see and touch exists because of energy. It is responsible for the existence of the planet because all matter arises from ener gy. So, what is pranayama, and what does it have to do with ener gy? I didn't understand the full mean ing behind pranayama until I listened to a fascinating talk given by Acharye Hema from the Atmavikasa Center of Yogic Sciences in Mysore, India. Pranayama means extending or expanding prana (life force energy) through the control of your inhalations, exhalations, and breath retention, which changes the depth, rate, and pattern of breathing. Therefore, the practice of pranayama provides you with a direct way to increase your energy. Prana is often misinterpreted as being the breath, but prana isn't breath. Your breath is the carrier of prana. Prana is energy beyond everything, it is the ener gy of the universe. Science tells us that our entire world is constantly moving, and the energy that is making everything move and come to life, the energy behind every cell and physiological process in your body , is prana. Prana permeates every living thing. It's intricately connected to life and health, and it is responsible for the ongoing of the universe.As children, we are so full of energy and enthusiasm for life, but as we age, we can become lethar gic and begin to feel like there is something missing in life. This happens when our contingency of prana is low because it has been worn down by lifestyle and environmental factors. Have you ever wondered why some people appear bright and are always energetic and mentally alert while others appear dull, are always lethar gic and slow to process information? The difference between health and sickness, brightn ess and dullness, and energy or lethar gy that those people experience is their contingence of prana. THE HUMAN BODY IS NOTHING MORE THAN A MACHINE, WHICH IS DESIGNED BY NA TURE T O CONSUME ENERGY . YOUR BODY WITHOUT PRANA IS AS GOOD AS THE CLOTHES YOU ARE WEARING. THE ONL Y DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LIVING THING AND A NON-LIVING THING IS THE AMOUNT OF PRANA IT CONT AINS. We are all born in the same way, and we can all consume prana in the same way, therefore, we can all be equally healthy . If you have been suffering with chronic health problems for a long time, and you can't seem to turn the need le on your health even though you have taken all the right steps toward healing, you migh t need to look beyond toxins and pathogens and focus on your energetic health. When your energetic system is strong, it creates an environment within your physical body that is less conducive to pathogens thriving. We can all experience varying degrees of energy, health, mental alertness, and vitality according to how we use our body , and the way we use our body determines our prana intake levels.When we breathe, it happens automatically without thinking. Breathing is critical for our survival, and each breath we take sends vital oxygen into our body and organs. Breathing is the primary source of prana, and if we keep our body healthy to consume and fully utilize prana, we can look youthful and feel healthy and happy right up until old age. Breathing is present in all of us, it is a part of nature' s design, and every single action that happens in the body and mind requires prana. Each time you move or think, you use prana, and with every breath, you consume prana. Every action and every thought you make either creates an abundance or a deficit of prana. PRANA IS LIKE MONEY . EVER Y TRANSACTION IN THE WORLD REQUIRES MONEY , JUST LIKE EVER Y MENT AL AND PHYSICAL ACTION REQUIRES PRANA. WHEN WE ARE YOUNG, THIS TRANSACTION OF PRANA IS IN BALANCE, BUT WHEN WE BECOME OLD, THE INT AKE OF PRANA IS OFTEN LESS THAN WHA T WE CONSUME. We eat food to consume energy, then we lose energy to digest the food. With every actio n, we consume energy and lose energy, so it's important to be mindful of your daily physical and mental activities. If the main inten tion to eat food is to gain prana, we must ensure that we eat the right foods. We eat because the prana loss is more than the prana gain, so we need a secondary energy source to make up the deficit and give us more energy. Food gives us calories, and those calories get converted into prana. However , calories and prana are not the same, and eating a high- calorie diet is not conducive to gaining a lot of prana.To break down food and extract energy you need energy, but when our digestive system breaks down the food, not everything is absorbed. As a result, there are many by-products and toxins that sit within the body . The body needs energy to rid the toxins, so it's essential to eat foods that aren' t toxic and that are easily digeste d. Otherwise, you create a situation where you are dumpin g the garbage, and on the other hand, you are cleaning the room, but no matter how hard you try to clean, you will find a messy floor . The situation inside the body and the mind are the same. If we want to remain feeling vibrant and healthy , we must learn how to preserve prana. For example, instead of rushing to get somewhere, try to slow down and walk slowly or instead of getting angry , try to think calmly and stay focused. When we get distracted, we lose control over our prana. When we are mentally relaxed, our systems are in a prana conservation mode. When we are stressed, angry , emotional, or distracted, our system uses prana. Remember , when your prana is low, it gives pathogens like viruses and unproductive bacteria an opportunity to thrive. When you are chronically ill, it is vital to conserve prana because your body needs all the energy to heal itself. That is why strenuous exercise is not advised when you are sick or suffering from chronic illness and trying to heal. Some people eat after feeling emotional or stressed out to get more energy because they feel drained. However , most people tend to reach for highly processed foods, which overworks your digestive system and sends you into a prana deficit. Too much excitement also uses prana. It's alright feeling excited in the moment, but afterward, there is a tendency to feel weak. In the yoga sutras, Patanjali calls it the fluctuation of rajas. For prana to keep us happy and healthy , we must observe nature and learn to be in touch with the elements because the five elements are the source of prana on Earth, and when we are in touch with the elements, our senses are heightened, and we become more aware. The greatest miracle of Earth is the sun returning to rise each day. Earth has been placed at a perfect distance from the sun so that we can consume prana efficiently . Everything on Earth has its mechanis ms for the consumption of prana, it is not just humans that consume prana, plants consume prana from sunlight. Sunlight is the primary source of prana onEarth, making the presence of the sun extremely important for all life to thrive, so it's essential to go outside and bask in the healing rays of the sun, without allowing yourself to burn of course! Try to observe your body and before eating, ask yourself: \"Will eating this food bring me the highest amount of prana?\" Foods that are easily digestible, highly absorbable, and leave little waste after energy is delivered such as fruits and vegetables contain the highest amounts of prana, whereas refined foods that are toxic and leave behind waste and by products have the lowest. Food was not designed to be used solely for entertainment. It was designed to sustain life and fulfil your pranic needs. Therefore, modifying your lifestyle is a prerequisite to pranayama. No matter how much pranayama you practice, you won' t get the results without a healthy lifestyle. These are the greatest truths of Patanjali' s yoga sutras. After the lifestyle modifications are in place, then you can practice the science of pranayama. Your breath interweaves many aspects of your life. How calm you are in a crisis and your sense of excite ment are directly connected to your breath. Your health and your breath are intricately linked; however , the breath is often overlooked. If you want to increase your health and mental wellbeing, pranayama is a great place to start. Follow these thr ee easy steps to practice pranayama: 1. First, ensure you have adopted a lifestyle that will support your practice. 2. Then, sit in a comfortable position with your spine straight and begin to observe your breath. Once you have mastered this step, you can start to control your breath. 3. The next step, which is the basis of pranayama, is to learn to elongate your inhalations and exhalations ef fortlessly .An ordin ary person breathes 26 times per minute, but with pranayama, the breath comes down to around ten breaths per minute, so every minute you are saving 16 breaths. Some people can slow their breathing and heart rate down so that an inhalation takes 20 minutes, and an exhalation takes 20 minutes. With practice, your will should be able to determine the length of your inhalations and exhalations. While rested, your body can clean, take away dead cells and rejuvenate. When you are stressed, the body does not function efficiently . However , when your mind is rested, your body builds immunity , self-healing is optimized, you will start looking and feeling younger , and your overall health will improve. Prana flows through the physica l, subtle, and causal body via an intricate web of channels called nadis, and the three main nadis\u2014Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna\u2014interconnect at points along the spine. These energy points are your chakras. Often, blockage s in nadis and chakras have a spiritual, mental, physical, and emotional effect, which can lead to illness and disease . Practicing pranayama activates the chakras and removes energetic blockages, which results in an even flow of prana throughout the entire body . The breath directly connects you to your chakras because your nerves carry prana and the central nervous system is in your spine, however, if your spine is not straight when you are practicing pranayama, it hinders the flow of prana in the same way water cannot flow easily through a twisted hose. The original intention of asana was to still the body so that you can become aware of the breath. Breath is compulsory , without it we would die. When you slow down your breath, you feel more rested, and when you feel rested, you feel energized. If you practice pranayama every day, your energy levels will improve, and gradually the way you look at your body will also change. Rather than going into fight or flight mode during a crisis, your mind will be slower , you will think clearer , your nervous system will becalmer , and you may avoid a toxic adrenaline dump which is the number one fuel source for viruses. The goal of pranayama is to develop an inner awareness or consciousness. To create space to see what is happening within yourself so that you can forget the body and feel within that which transce nds all form or outer excitem ents. If we can look and feel beyond the body , the diagnosis, the pain, and the symptoms, we will start to see we are much more than just a physical body . When we realize we are a part of the universe, we can tap into a source of bliss that is not dependent on a situation, person, or any exterior thing. Bliss is a neutral state, and to feel bliss, you must learn to be with yourself. When you become a master of your breath, your food requirements may lessen, and your cravings may disappear . You automatically become more silent, calm, and less inclined to indulge in mental chatter , negative thinking, or gossip. When you are quiet, you can feel a deeper connection with your true self, and who is a better friend to you than yourself! When you learn to conquer your breath, you will conquer your fear of death. Once you learn to becom e breathless (breath retention), a peaceful feeling arises, you will suddenly begin to feel a sense of formlessness and expansion, and you will become fearless. According to The Shiva Samhita (Classical Sansk rit text on Hatha Yoga), 350,000 nadis exist in the human body . The three important ones are: Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna Nadis Ida is the left channel. She refers to Chandra (yin). Her energies are associated with the moon, the river Ganga, and the color white. She is feminine, cold, and she originate s in Muladhara, the root chakra , and ends in the left nostril. Pingala is the right channel. He refers to Surya (yang). Pingala is red, masculine, energetic, and hot. He represents the sun and is associated with the river Yamun a. He also originates in Muludhara and ends in the right nostril.Ida and Pingala form two snakes, which spiral around the Sushumna nadi. Sushumna is the central channel and is associated with the river Saraswati. Sush umna runs along the spinal cord in the center , and through the seven chakras. It originates just below the Muladhara chakra and ends at Sahasrara chakra, at the crown of the head. The practice of Nadi Shodhana Pranayama, or alternate nostril breathing, evens out imbalances in the nadis. Best T ime to Practice Practice in the morning on an empty stomach, in a quiet place, away from any potent ial air pollutants, and at least one hour away from eating, bathing, or sexual activity . Who Should Not Practice Pranayama? You should practice pranayama with care during menstruation and pregnancy . Pranayama is not recommend ed for those with any form of heart condition or recent history of a heart attack. People with low blood pressure should practice under the guidance of a teacher . Avoid if you have a fever , any respiratory illness, or are going through radiation or chemotherapy . Preparing for Practice Find a quiet place and sit in lotus pose or a cross-legged seated position facing either east or north. It's important to keep your spine straight throughout this practice. If you need support, lean against a wall or use bolsters or cushions as required. Relax your shoulders and close your eyes. Draw the crown of your head up toward the sky to ensure your head, neck, and chest are in a straight line and your spine is lengthened. Begin to settle into your natural breath, breathing in and out through your nose.Nadi Shodhana Pranayama (Alternate Nostril Br eathing) Rest your left hand on your left knee with the palm up. Bring the right hand up to your face. Place your pointer and middle fingers very lightly on your forehead in between the eyebrows. Your ring finger (and if you wish your little finger) will open and close the left nostril while the thumb will open and close the right nostril. Press your thumb on the right nostril and gently inhale slowly and steadily through the left nostril. Do not force your breathing, keep it natural and gentle. Close the left nostril, so both nostrils are now closed. Hold your breath for a moment at the top of your inhale. Lift your right thumb from the right nostril and release the breath out through the right. Pause for a moment at the bottom of the exhale. Breathe in slowly through the right nostril, hold both nostrils closed for a moment, then exhale through the left. That is one round of Nadi Shodhana Pranayama. Continue to inhale and exhale through alternate nostrils for 5-10 full rounds, starting at a count of five for each inhale and exhale and gradually increasing as you develop your practice. I hope you now have a new understanding of energetic health. It is such an important aspect of wellness because it is the precursor to your physical health and mastering the art of breathing to increase prana is another tool that will bring you one step closer to healing so you can get on with living your best life. \"A healer's power stems not from any special ability, but from maintaining the courage and awareness to embody and express the universal healing power that every human being naturally possesses.\" - ERIC MICHA 'EL LEVENTHALn CHAPTER FOURTEEN Your Energetic System\u2014 The Gateway to Healing ow that we know we are made up of sub-atomic particles that emit energy fields and our energetic system controls our biochemistry and physiology , we can begin to understand the importance of energetic health. When I first started working with energy, I noticed a direct correlation between a person' s physical health complaints and an imbalance somewhere in their ener gy field. For example, when my four-year -old daughter suffered from Rheumatoid Arthritis, all I wanted to do was take her pain away , so I studied Reiki to heal her. I placed my hands on her ankles every day, which was the most painful part of her body , and after a short period of time, it seemed to ease her symptoms. Fortunately , she managed to overcome Rheumatoid Arthritis in conjunction with a change of diet and supplementation. However , a few years later, her dis-ease manifested as mental health challenges. Even though she had already overcome Systemic Rheumatoid Arthri tis, her dis- ease' s root cause, her ener getic health, needed to be addressed. During her mental health crisis, specialists prescrib ed her pharmaceuticals, and she was referred to psychiatrists, psychologists,psychotherapists, and behavioral therapists. Suddenly I was on a merry go round ride withi n a public health system that wasn' t designed to treat the root cause of her health condition, and it all seemed hit and miss. It wasn' t until I addressed her health issues holistically that she overcame her mental health challenges. Similarly , when I was living in India, a friend of mine came down with a nasty skin reaction from what we thought at the time was a jellyfish sting. The red rash on her upper body appeared alarmingly fast, so I decided to give her a Reiki treatment before bed. To both of our surprise, when she woke up the next day , the rash had completely disappeared with no trace! Most recently , a client of mine started convulsing from pulses of energy that he felt running through him during an energy healing session, and another client told me that certain emotional issues had cleared for her after one healing treatment. My point here is that the power of energy healing should not be underestimated. When you receive an energy healing treatment, whether it be for an acute or a chronic condition, it activates your own remarkable self-healing mechanisms, which is often the catalyst for healing. When we experience pain in our physical body , we instinctively know to place our hands on the part of the body that is causing us pain. We do this without realizing that our hands are capable of transmitting healing energy. Everyone can be a conduit for healing energy, some are just more open to it than others. The thing is, when you doubt yourself and your ability to heal, you doubt the healing energy that is moving through you. That energy is a part of the universe, and you are a part of the cosmos. Thoughts are a form of energy, so the moment that you become skeptical, doubt ful, or you over conceptualize your ability to heal, healing won' t happen. I once gave a Reiki healing treatment to a lady while working in a luxury resort in Indonesia, and as I began her treatment, a little voice inside my head whispered, \"this is ridiculous, you don't have any special ability .\" Thankfully , as soon I recognized the thought, it quickly disappe ared. I used my inten tionality to stay connected to the healing energy source flowing through me and gave a powerfu l healing treatment despite experiencing a momentary setback in my thinking.DOUBT CAN CREEP IN ON ALL OF US, AND DURING THE MOST INOPPOR TUNE TIMES. HOWEVER, IT IS WHA T YOU CHOOSE T O DO WITH IT THA T DEFINES THE OUTCOME AND YOUR ABILITY T O HEAL. In my practice, I discovered that some people are very tactile and like hands-on treatments because it helps their brains assimilate that something is happening, whereas other people are more open, and they don't need physical touch to affirm to them that healing is happening. Wherever you sit, if you do go down the energy healing path, call upon your spirit guides and the angels to help guide you toward a healer that aligns with your highest good. To truly understand how energy works, one must understand the body' s energetic system. We not only inhabit a physical body , we also inhabit a spiritu al body , which we know as the human body-field. It is also commonly referred to in spiritual realms as the aura. An aura is an energetic body that comprises etheric matter which extends several inches beyond the physical body . Within our aura, seven major chakras are located along the spine. These are the ener gy centers that prana flows through. As already mentioned, our energetic system also comprises of nadis. According to yogic philosophy , there are 72,000 nadis in the human body , and in Tradition al Chinese Medicine, nadis are known as the meridians. Both are channels for ener gy flow that connect the seven major chakras. The word chakra is derived from the Sanskrit word meaning wheel and translated from Hindi it means wheel of spinning energy. Chakras are a vortex-like powerhouse of energy. Think of them as invisible, rechar geablebatteries. They are constantly charged and rechar ged by a continuous flow of prana that is connected to the energy of the universe, much the same as how your home power supply is connected to a central power supply . Imagine a vertical power line that runs from the base of your spine up and out of the crown of your head! Just like your power supply at home, the chakras connect your spiritual body to your physical body . They regulate the flow of energy throughout the electrical network that runs through your physical body , much like the electrical wiring in your house. Your energetic body and its chakras form the etheric counterpart of your physical body , and the health of your physical body , is reflected in the etheric body , and vice versa. FOR EVER YTHING T O FUNCTION CORRECTL Y, THE CHAKRAS NEED T O BE FREE FROM BLOCKAGES OR DIST ORTIONS, AND THE ELECTRICAL WIRING NEEDS T O TRANSMIT THE CORRECT INFORMA TION T O EVER Y CELL IN YOUR BODY . Chakras can become imbalanced or blocked from environ mental, emotional, or physical stress and trauma. If the body' s energy system doesn' t flow freely or the information between the cells is distorted, illness or disease can manifest somewhere in the physical body . THE SEVEN MAJOR CHAKRAS AND THEIR LOCA TIONS ARE: 1. The Root Chakra or Muladhara is located at the base of the spine. 2. The Sacral Chakra or Svadhishthana is located in the pelvis. 3. The Solar Plexus Chakra or Manipura is located between the navel and solar plexus. 4. The Heart Chakra or Anahata is located at the center of your chest. 5. The Throat Chakra or V ishuddha is located in the neck and throat region. 6. The Third Eye Chakra or Ajna is located between the eyebrows. 7. The Crown Chakra or Sahasrara is located at the crown of the head.How do I Know if My Chakras ar e Blocked? Chakras are responsible for providing that all-important mindbody connection, and each chakra connects to a specific area of your body . If one or more chakras are blocked, it may result in physical health problems or a decline in mental wellbeing. For example, if you find that you consistently have a hard time speaking out, giving public talks, or saying what you want, this could indicate a blockage or imbalance in your throat chakra. Or if you have trouble feeling grounded and stable, this could indicate that your root chakra is imbalanced. USE THE FOLLOWING LIST OF CHAKRA IMBALANCES AS A GUIDE T O HEAL YOUR ENERGETIC SYSTEM:The root chakra is associated with your connection to earth, survival, health, abundance, passion, and family . When the root chakra is blocked, one can often feel stuck and unbalanced in life, you may find it difficult to move forward, and you may feel a depleting sense of self.

Are you in a field of work that you enjoy doing, which enables you to follow your highest calling? Or are you somebody who struggles to find what you are passionate abou t and the idea of creating an income from your passions seems too good to be true? Most of us would love to be following our heart' s desires but knowing where to start is often one of the biggest hurdles. You may already know what your passions are but generating an income from doing what you love to maintain the type of lifestyle you want to live may prove challenging. Or you may already be carrying out work that you are passionate about, but you lack the inner harmony which will enable you to enjoy it fully . The levels of abundance that we experience lie within our mindset. To create an abundant life, we must drop the idea that abundance will come, and start living abundantly now, by being grateful for what we have in the present. Most of the world' s population lives in extreme povert y, so if you have a roof over your head, clean water to drink, and enough food to eat, you have something to be grateful for!THE UNIVERSE IS FILLED WITH LIMITLESS ABUNDANCE, AND IT WILL AL WAYS PROVIDE EXACTL Y WHA T YOUR SOUL NEEDS T O EXPERIENCE FOR IT T O EV OLVE. THE KEY IS T O TRUST THA T EVER YTHING THA T COMES YOUR W AY IS AN OPPOR TUNITY T O LEARN AND GROW . Our thoughts are like boomerangs\u2014whatever we think, we energetically attract, and some of our thoughts repel the very thing that we want to have more of. However , please don't think that your thoughts created your illness. Your thoughts did not create your illness, nor did your negativ e thinking. There are very real physical reasons behind the epidemic of chronic illness and your mind is not one of them. Let me explain. Say you carry an unconscious belief that you are unworthy or undeserving of financial abundance, you might create situations that will prove your unworthiness, and you will continue to experience a lack of abundance. If you saw a wealthy person pull up outside your house in the latest Porsche, how would you feel? Would you think, \"Good on them for creating the financial means to buy such an awesome car\" or would you feel a tinge of envy or disgust and think, \"I wonder what bad thing s they must have done to buy a car like that?\" Those types of situations often reveal where our mindset lies around money and abundance. Suppose you notice that you hold some form of negativity towar d people who live financially abundant lives. In that case, you might be creating experiences that will stop you from experiencing financial abundance.Let's not forget that money doesn' t create true, lasting happiness. However , since we live within the realms of a largely materialistic world, it can offer the freedom to choose how one wishes to live, including the type of healthcare that you can access. The average person spends most of their waking hours at work, which is why it's so impo rtant to carry out work that aligns with your soul's purpose. If you are not doing what you truly love, what and who are you working for? A passion is something that you might do where time simply disappears. When you are so engaged in doing what you love that time is no longer relevant. Every cell in your entire being is enlivened with joy, and you feel a deep sense of inner fulfilment. When you find that spark of creativity , you instinctively want to do more of it. However , we often don't have the time or resources to continue doing what we truly love, and more often than not, we sink back into what' s comfortable and familiar and stay working in a 9-5 job. Your soul will recognize when you are on the right path, and it will give you subtle signs. You might notice synchronicities or experience a heightened state of intuition or feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. The universe always provides an abundant flow of energy, which will help you carry out your soul' s purpose, and you might find yourself in certain situations or circumstances that help you on your path. When you are living in align ment with your soul' s purpose, you automatically tune into the higher vibrations of the universe, a safe, loving, and nurturing energy that always provides precisely what is needed for your soul in that moment. TO TRUL Y MANIFEST YOUR HEAR T'S DESIRES, YOU MUST BE WILLING T O SURRENDER AND LET GO OF THE NEED T O CONTROL LIFE. WHEN YOU LIVE ACCORDING T O YOURHIGHER SELF , EVER YTHING THA T DID NOT SER VE YOUR HIGHEST GOOD MAGICALL Y DROPS A WAY, WHICH CREA TES THE SP ACE T O WELCOME NEW BEGINNINGS AND POSSIBILITIES. When life is lived from the heart, you might attract your soulmate, reconnect with someone who is supposed to be in your life, or perhaps you break up with your current partner . You might quit your job, change your career , or start a course of study . You may even feel drawn to a new place of residence or a new country . Whatever the change, it is the first step toward living a more soulful and passion-filled life! It is human nature to want to do what is familiar and comforta ble, and most people opt to work in a job that brings a secure stream of income, even if the work is unfulfilling. Living in a society that is largely based around capitalism and consumerism doesn't provide the type of environment that allows for self- exploration. Instead, it promotes job security as an important priority in life, and the accumu lation of wealth and prestige is often more highly regarded over creativity , free-thinking individualism, and self-expression. The indoctrinati on often starts as early as primary school, and by the time we graduate from universit y, we are often in debt for the education we have just received, which create s a dependency on a job that will bring the necessary funds to pay of f the debt. It's sad to think that we have accumulated debt by the time we graduate university befor e discovering what we are truly passionate about, and often those who don't study or atten d university carry a deep-seated feeling of being not good enough, not smart enough, or even a failure. And therein lies the trap. We often follow the guidance of well-m eaning teachers, parent s, or society in general, thinking that a certain path is the right one for us to take without first knowing who we truly are. As adults, our job pays for a lifestyle, which often dictates our quality of life. Our income pays to own a house, or it puts money back into the pockets of a landlord, and the type of house we live in is entirely dependenton the amount of money we earn. Our paychecks dictate the amount and type of food we eat, the clothes we wear , the healthcare we can access, and how well we are able to care for and support our loved ones. However , this often comes at a price. We become dependent on our jobs, and this can lead to feeling trapped because we need to keep paying the bills, regardless of if it makes us truly happy . Money becomes our driving force, and we spend a substantial amount of time working away from our loved ones, weekdays are long and drawn out and weekends are something we look forward to. Some jobs pay enough money , enabling the lucky few to save and go away on holiday , buy a new car, or even upgrade their house, furnishings, or possessions. However , life is based around working for someone else, and we organize our time around our work comm itments, which often doesn' t provide much freedom. A few years ago, my life looked like this. I would wake to the sound of my alarm clock ringing, and it wasn' t a particularly nice sound as it represented my day ahead. I would apply my makeup and dress in my nicest clothes before catching an early morning bus to the city to start my daily job. I worked alone in a boutique shoe shop in an upmarket part of town, but the job wasn' t in any way menta lly stimulating, and I would often spend my time daydreaming from the sheer boredom of doing nothing. Hardly any customers walked into the shop, and I would sit all day long, watching time pass, which gave me a lot of time to think. One day, as I sat on the cold leather couch in the shoe shop that was filled with bright artificial light, I realized there must be more to life than working in a mindless job that I wasn' t passionate about, just to pay the bills, so I started to think of ways to create an income from doing what I loved. The problem was, I had no idea what I was passionate about. I was a single parent who lived my life based around my daughter 's needs, which didn' t leave much room to discover my passions. As if by coincid ence, as soon as I began questioning my life, I started having severe attacks of vertigo, and I was forced to quit my job as a sales assistant.I saw my decline in health as a sign, as if my body was warning me to take notice. Something told me \"You are not here to play it small and work for someone else,\" which flipped the way I looked at my debilitating vertigo. I soon realized it was time for me to take some time out to discover what I was passionate about, and I thanked the spins for the opportunity! I guess some of us are lucky to have wake up calls like I did, although they don't seem to be blessings at the time. If I hadn' t become sick, I might still be working in that shop instead of finding my soul' s purpose through healing myself. My focus then shifted toward my health, and after a plethora of tests and no real diagnosis, I spent the next few weeks bedridden. The weeks turned into months, and I was still no closer to finding out what was wrong with me, but spending so much time at home allowed me to take up yoga. It also gave me the opportunity to finish my Freelance Journalism Diploma, and I subm itted an article on mental health, which I wrote as part of my course assignment, to the editor of a well-respected magazine. I always loved to write, but I never thought I was good enough to make money . It turned out, the editor of the magazine loved my story and published it word for word without editing it. Meanwhile, yoga became my lifeline. I spent my days learning new postures that would help my symptoms, and I suddenly found myself having to juggle time between my two newly found passions and being a full-time mother . Submitting my first article and getting it published gave me enough confidence to realize that I was good enough to write, and I could make money from it if I wanted to. And teaching myself yoga at home made me realize I didn' t need to attend classes. I was too scared to atten d classes in case I had a vertigo attack, however; learning yoga outside of a studio also made me realize if I was able to teach myself then I was able to guide others. Then, a few months later, my landlords decided to put the house I was renting up for sale, and I was suddenly faced with the uncertainty of how long I could stay in my home. So, instead of waiting around, I decided to give two weeks-notice on my lease. My hometown of Auckland City was becoming ridiculously expensive to live in, so rather than looking for another house to rent and being at themercy of a new set of landlords who called the shots, I decided to sell up, and I gave away carloads of stuff to charity . I successfully whittled all my possessions down to a few bags of clothes, and I lived in my camper van with my daughter and dog in tow . At this point, I had no idea where I wanted to live or what I wanted to do, and I lived in the realms of uncertainty . I waited a few months until my daughter graduated from her course, then I was finally free to leave Auckland City . The moment I left the city, I never looked back. I was no longer tied to paying for a lifestyle that I didn' t enjoy . I was no longer tied into paying for someone else's mortgage to house stuff that I didn' t need. I was no longer tied into a dead-end job, and I was no longer tied to a life that I didn' t enjoy living. I created the space to follow what I was genuinely passionate about, even though I had no idea how I would survive financially . In the end, my leap of faith paid off. I have had five articles published since that first one in December 2013. I have been lucky enough to travel and teach yoga around the world, and I created an online holis tic wellness business where I guide people toward healing. I get to live a lifestyle that I had previously only dreamed of, and the most rewarding part is that I share my passions with others while getting paid to do what I love to do! My point is you deserve to be living a life filled with passion and purpose. You deserve to earn a living by sharing your unique gifts with the world. After all, there is only one of you, and even if you think there are plenty of people out there doing what you want to do, there is no one out there who can deliver what you can provide, because you are unique. You deserve to live a life that you enjoy , and you too can have the freedom to express yourself in whatever ways are most fulfilling to you. However , to create something new, you must be willing to do something you have never done before. You can't expect to get different results if you don't change your formula!SOMETIMES YOU MUST T AKE A GIANT LEAP INT O THE UNKNOWN AND TRUST THA T YOU WILL FIND YOUR WINGS ON THE W AY DOWN. THERE IS NO GUARANTEED FORMULA TO SUCCESS, BUT WITH AN OPEN HEAR T, A WILLINGNESS T O LEARN, AND, MOST IMPOR TANTL Y, WITH FOCUS, COMMITMENT , AND CONSISTENT ACTION, YOU CAN ACHIEVE ANYTHING YOU PUT YOUR MIND T O. When you decid e if you are here on Earth to survive or thrive, your choice will set the foundation of your purpose. But remember , your soul didn' t return to Earth to play it safe. It came here to grow , evolve, and thrive! Often, what we perceive as challenges, obstacles, or setbacks are little gifts from above, which are opportunities to evolve as souls. Without experiencing hardships and the emotions that come with them, such as pain, grief, and despair , we wouldn' t learn and grow . You only live once, so what are you waiting for? Ditch the fear or uncertainty and start taking a step forward in the direction of your heart! Every minute you spend procrastinating or wishing your life were different is a minute that could be spent creating that which makes your heart sing. Here are seven steps that may help you find your soul' s purpose so you can start creating a life that you truly desire: Become Debt and Financially Fr ee The first step I took to live this incredibly rewarding lifestyle was to become debt-free. I didn' t want to be tied into a 9-5 job to pay for a lifestylethat I wasn' t even enjoying, but like most people, I didn' t have an excess amount of money in the bank, nor did I have wealthy parents. So, I sold all my stuff to pay off my debt and live the life I wanted to live. That's right. I sold everything! Which meant I didn' t need a house to keep all my stuff in, and I saved money on rent and utilities. Don' t be fooled by the false sense of security that a job gives you. Unless you work for yourself, you are at the mercy of your boss, and where is the freedom in that? Instead, start thinking about how to create an income through your passions rather than being a cog in society' s factory and working as a means to an end. Commit to Self-Inquiry and T ake Action Ask yourself, if you never had to work another day in your life, if there were no limits to what you could be, do, have, or experience, what would you choose to spend your time doing? If you find it hard answering this question, try to think back to when you were a child. What did you enjoy doing then? Try to be as realistic and specific as possible. Spending your time sunbathing or creating sandcastles on the beach will not garner you the results you may be looking for unless you think about designing the type of lifestyle that will enable you to spend all day sunbathing and making sandcastles! Think about how you could overcome any obstacles that may be holding you back from taking that first step toward creating a life that you truly desire. Is there anything that you need to do or learn to help you achieve your dreams? When I realized how much I loved yoga, I sold my car and used the money to buy a ticket to India, where I trained to be a yoga teacher . While I waited to leave, I read books on every subject I was passionate about, I practiced yoga every day, I furth ered my training in Reiki, and I started my blog. I invested my time into things that I was passionate about and developed the necessary skills to become financially free. What are you currently doing with your time? And are you using it wisely? I spent a lot of time alone, whic h meant I couldn' t use television, social engagements, or entertainment as distractions. Most addictions arise to giveus a false sense of happiness and a temporary escape from reality. Whether it is an addiction to being in a relationship, with food, sugar , alcohol, drugs, work, sex, excessive thinking, spending money , looking good, or anything that takes control over your life. Instead of trying to escape reality, why not focus on building that which truly serves you? Be W illing to Let Go To create the life you truly desire, you must create space for something new, which means you need to be willing to let go of the old and anything that no longer serves you. This could include a relationship, a lifestyle, a job, or anything that holds you back from true happiness. Know that everyone' s journey is different and try not to compare yourself to others or take on their judgment, because it is your life, and only you are living it. I came across a lot of criticism, judgment, and jealousy , and I had to let some relationships go, but that was inevitable. I realize now that the people who stood by me are my real friends and family . Let's face it\u2014when you change, you can't expect everybody to understand, so rather than harboring bitterness or resentment, send them love and light and let them go. Be W illing to T ake Risks and Make Sacrifices To fulfil my goals, I did what I needed to do to get to where I wanted to go, knowing that my current situation was temporary . I lived rent-free in my van with only a small bag of clothes. I did away with make-u p, lived off rice and vegetables, and used public bathrooms. For one year, I lived in this very basic way , and this is where I found myself again. I can remember going for two weeks in the cold winter without a shower and feeling desperate for one, so I snuck into a gym and had the longest and most exquisite hot shower of my life! Going from having everything to nothing (in a material sense) made me appreciate the little things I had previously taken for granted.You must be willing to take risks and make sacrifices to get what you want. Life would be boring otherwise! It is through making mistakes and going through hardships that we learn, grow , and become stronger . Get to Know the Real Y ou People will try to tell you who you are\u2014don' t believe them! Once you realize you are not a product of society or your childhood, your past doesn' t define who you are. When you learn to look beyond all societal conditioning, the labels begin to drop away , creating space to reconnect with your authentic self. From this new space of awareness, self-love and acceptance arise. You will become more energetically in-tune with the higher vibra tions of the universe, and you will find that situations will magically appear to help you create the life you truly desire. Realize the Pr esent is All Y ou Have Once you dive into an entirely new way of life, things start to look different. You may find that you no longer enjoy doing the same things as before. For me, I could no longer stomach eating animals, so I became a vegetarian, and I found myself only wanting to eat foods that nourished my body , which meant I stopped my long addiction to sugar . On the negative side, I kept mulling over certain events in my past, which made me repeatedly relive the feelings. Try not to live in the past, worry about the future, or over-analyze your situation, which only takes you away from the present. Your thoughts create the reality you exist in right now, so enjoy the present moment, because that is all you have! Practice T rust and Hold Y our Faith The two most important things that helped me through the difficult times were to have trust in the universe and faith in my journey . Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith and trust that everything will come toyou at the right time. And when things don't go as planned, try to see the blessings that are so often hidden. Looking back, the past few years certainly had their ups and downs, but let's be realistic; life wasn' t designed to stay static. We have been created to experience and express a full range of emotions. It is only the attachment to an idea or expectation that forms the basis of unhappiness. Above all else, stay true to yourself, follow your heart, believe in yourself, and never , ever give up on your dreams. \"Crystal healing brings energy back into balance, it clears blockages and harmonizes the whole in order to restore equilibrium.\" - JUDY HALLt CHAPTER SIXTEEN Healing with Crystals he most precious gift I have ever received was a quartz crystal and a crystal healing book that my father gave me for my birthday . My father was a healer , and he had used the quartz crystal on his mother before she passed away from terminal cancer . As a young child, I can remember watching him sit with the crystal for long periods of time at her bedside. It wasn' t until much later that I realized the special role the crystal had played in my grandmother 's transition toward death. I will never forget the day I opened my gift. The clear quartz point was protectively tucked into a purple pouch bag that my mother had crocheted, and inside the book was a hand-written poem, which read: \"My darling daughter: let the winds of chan ce dance with your heart least the seas of despair drown you. Hope the healing path is as great for you as it was for me.\" I felt touched that he had handed the special family crystal down to me, but up until then, I had never used crystals to heal, and I didn' t know quite what to do with it. For many years, the crystal sat on my bedside table, and I would occasionally gaze into it and intuitively feel its magical powers. Then one day, as I was gazing into it, I was suddenly overcome with an intense rush of energy, which inspired me to read the book. After feeling a deep calling, I decided to start using the quartz point as a healing tool, just like my father had. So, I gave it a salt bath and left it outside under the light of the full moon. Then I activated it using the Reiki symbols that I had received during my initiations into becoming a Reiki Master . From that day onward, I felt a special connection to the crysta l, I never travelled anywhere without it, and it became the most prized possession in my healing toolkit. If you have felt drawn to crysta ls, take that as a sign from above. They are incredible healing tools that will aid you on your healing journey , and this chapter will show you exactly how to use them. How do Crystals W ork? Crystals provide a gentle form of healing that activates the body' s innate ability to self-heal. They work by transmitting energy and adjusting the subtle energies of the physical body. They also absorb, focus, transmute, and transmit all types of electromagnetic energy. Think of them as cosmic receivers that pass energy down from the universe to be absorbed and used by the physical body . They heal through vibration, resonance, and color , and they work holistically at a mind, body , psyche, and soul level by restoring balance and realigning the aura that surrounds the physical body .

This may explain why for some people, life is full of challenges, adversities, and setbacks, while others are born into a certain set of circumstances and glide through life with comfort and ease. If we consider that the family we were born into was a part of our soul' s plan and whatev er experience that we have, whether we deem it to be good or bad , is ultimately for our highest good, we can hold in our hearts an unwavering trust and faith in all that is. Don' t get me wrong\u2014I'm not saying that a horrific event such as being attacked is ultimately for your highest good. No one deserves to be attacked, and your soul certainly doesn' t choose to be attacked. It's important to know that although our soul may choose our parents, life is not predetermined, and we have free will to choose our life' s direction. Being human automatically gives the power of free will and choice, but we must be discerni ng where we spend our time and who we surround ourselves with because we are energetic beings. Our energetic body consumes everything that it encounters, whether good or bad . We are all on different soul journeys, therefore; it's futile to judge others or ourselves. We are often our harshest critics, and the onslaught of negative self-talk can cause immense suffering. However , once we realize that we arenot alone, that we have been given gifts to share with the world and we have access to angels and spirit guide s that will help us, we can begin to see life as a gift. YOU ARE AN OUTW ARD EXPRESSION OF DIVINITY THA T MOVES THROUGH YOU, AND YOU WERE BORN T O SHINE BRIGHTL Y, TO REALIZE YOUR P ASSIONS AND T ALENTS, AND TO LIVE LIFE T O THE FULLEST EXPRESSION OF YOUR HIGHEST SELF . What is Intuition? Intuition is knowing without knowing why. It's instinctively knowing something that you don't know how you know . It is like a muscle; the more you use it, the more it develops. To strengthen your intuition, always listen to your feelings and trust in your gut. Trust the very first feeling you have about something because that feeling is usually the right one. Intuition is not attached to the mind. Once we think, we lose our ability to tap into our intuition because our thought patterns are usually pre-p rogrammed, conditioned beliefs that we have gained throughout our life experience, and most of the time they are not conducive to our spiritual development. Here are a few ways to strengt hen your connection to your higher self and activate and superchar ge your spiritual development: Cultivate a Healthy Pineal GlandThe pineal gland, known as \"the seat of the soul,\" is the governing gland of the sixth chakra. It is a pea-si zed endocrine gland, shaped like a pinecone, located in the brain near the hypothalamus and pituitary gland. Also known as the third eye, the pineal gland is considered the gateway to portals that connect us to metaphysical dimensions and spiritual planes that help us connect to higher consciousness through clarity , concentration, bliss, insight, intuition, and awareness. Activating your pineal gland can cause the brain to secrete consciousness-expanding bio-chemicals, such as Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). This is known as \"the spirit molecule,\" which is believed by ancient traditions to open the third eye chakra, increase intuition, and bring about higher states of consciousness and the experience of being in a state of bliss or enlightenment. When the third eye is open, it opens us up to the realms of telepathy , clairvoyance, enhanced imagination, lucid dreaming, astral projection, seeing auras, and all things psychic. A perso n with an open third eye sees the world as it is from the highest truth, and they have an unyielding connection to spirit. But the build-up of toxins in the pineal gland causes it to . The pineal gland' s main causes of calcification are exposure to toxic heavy metals, chemicals, radiation, and electromagnetic frequencies, which interfere with spiritual development. HERE ARE A FEW WAYS TO DECALCIFY YOUR PINEAL GLAND AND A WAKEN YOUR THIRD EYE: Avoid Fluoride. Tap water and fluoridated toothpaste are the main fluoride sources, so ensure your drinking water and toothpaste are free from fluoride. Minimize Exposur e to Electr omagnetic Frequencies generated by cell phones, W i-Fi, smart meters, microwaves, x-rays, and cellphone towers . Introduce Supp lements and Eat Organic Whole Foods. Supplements and whole foods that support the detoxification of your pineal gland include nascent iodine, barley grass juice powder , blueberries, turmeric, chaga mushroom, spirulina, Atlantic dulse, and cilantro. Pure Essential Oils may stimulate the pineal gland and facilitate heightened states of spiritu al awareness. These includ e lavender , sandalwood, frankincense, and pine. Essential oils may be inhaled directly , used in a dif fuser , or added to a body oil or bathwater . Sun Gazing is a great way to boost your pineal gland. Gaze gently at the sun during the first few minutes of sunrise and the last few minutes of sunset. Meditate using visualization, the power of intentionality , and chanting. Spend at least 10 minutes each day visualizing your pineal gland decalcifying and consciously activate your third eye. Send gratitude to your third eye for your innate intuitive abilities and connection to nature through the circadian rhythms that the pineal gland governs\u2014end with chanting AUM , the sound of the universe. Crystals are powerful allies in the quest to awaken your third eye. Try placing an amethyst, lapis lazuli, blue topaz, rhodonite, or sodalite between and slightly above the brow during meditation. Practice Y oga (as outlined in chapter 12) Meditate (as outlined in chapter 5) Open Y our Eighth Chakra and Connect to Y our Higher Self Your eighth chak ra is located approximately two feet above your head. It is the first of the five higher or spiritual chakras which help you become one with the universe. The eighth chakra is the bridge between your personality and your soul, and when activated, it increases your spiritual awareness. It helps to uncover spiritual gifts and your soul' s purpose, and it releases karmic imprints. It connects you to your higher self and gives you the experience of divine love and spiritual compassion for all living beings.ENERGY HEALERS AND SPIRITUAL TEACHERS WHO HAVE AN ACTIV ATED EIGHTH CHAKRA HOLD THE ABILITY TO OPEN A PERSON'S EIGHTH CHAKRA, OR USING THE POWER OF INTENTIONALITY AND VISUALIZA TION, YOU CAN OPEN YOUR EIGHTH CHAKRA YOURSELF USING THIS SIM PLE, YET POWERFUL TECHNIQUE: Sit or lie in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and allow your body' s weight to draw down toward the earth. Notice the rise and fall of your breath and observe how it naturally slows the more you begin to relax. Draw your breat h deep down into your belly . Allowing your breath to wash through your entire body like water . Notice a pathway along the back of your spine\u2014a pathway of white golden light. Like a beautiful rushing waterfall, follow this pathway up, beginning at the base of your spine. With pure intention, assist it in flowing gently\u2014a cascading flow of pure white light, rushing along the back of your spine. Gently cascading over and over. As you begin to feel this wondrous trickling of light, eternally abundant and multi-dimensional, notice how it flicks a light switch on. Notice how it switches on your eighth chakra, the glowing orb or consciousn ess radiating around and above your head. Be with this feeling, gently and tenderly , assisting the flow of golden white light as it flows freely along your spine and activates your eighth chakra. When you feel complete, simply rest, take a few deep breaths, allowing your entire being a few moments to rest and integrate. When you are ready , slowly open your eyes. Take a Cleansing Bath to Clear Y our EnergyIf you are feelin g emotionally drained, energetically \"heavy ,\" or if you have been exposed to negativ e energy or an unpleasant encounter , a cleansing bath can help clear your energy. Mix one pound each of sea salt and baking powder in a bathtub and soak for a minimum of 20 minutes, then rinse of f in the shower . Activate Y our Thymus Gland to A waken Y our Energy Field When you activate your thym us, you will clear your channel to the unified energy field and allow yourself to focus and connect with higher consciousness. The thym us gland is the seat of your spiritual development, and it also plays an importa nt role in immu ne function. When it's open and expanded, your thymus becomes your signature. It acts like a beacon that lets all the higher beings know you're one of the lightworkers in the spiritual realms. Find a quiet place to sit, away from any distractions, and begin to focus your attention on your thymus gland, which is located betwee n your heart chakra in the center of your chest and your throat chakra in the center of your throat. Use the power of your intentionality to activate your thymus or call on the help of your spirit guides or the angels for assistance. Visualize your thymus like it's a flower and feel it opening and expandin g. As you do this, you might feel warmth in the area. Allow your thymus to open and expand even further by gently tapping on it and intending for it to open. Keep doing this visualization technique as often as you like, to activate and superchar ge your spiritual development and to connect you to the pantheon of lightworkers. Open the Hidden Channel Renowned spiritual teacher , author , and master healer Deborah King discovered an ancient hidden channel that connects your pituitary gland and your pineal gland. This connection allows you to experience the divine presence within yourself. As humankind evolved, the channel weakened, but fortunately it didn' t disappear . To open your hidden channel, listen to the Hidden Channel Meditation by Deborah King on soundcloud.com.The T welve Chakras You may be familiar with the seven major chakras of the human body , however; there are an additiona l five chakras known as the higher chakras. The 12th chakra, referred to as the gateway to the divine, is the highest connection we can make to universal consciousness. It is located outside the etheric body , and it contains all the energy needed for ascension to higher spiritual planes. It is the source of an individual' s strength and power , and it holds the ability to use ener gy to dissolve into Oneness with all that is. KNOWING ONESELF THROUGH SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT IS A LIFE-LONG PROCESS. FOR SOME, IT IS A DAUNTING T ASK THA T IS FRAUGHT WITH P AINFUL AND CHALLENGING EXPERIENCES. HOWEVER, SOMETIMES THESE EXPERIENCES ARE EXACTL Y WHA T THE SOUL NEEDS T O W AKE UP AND REALIZE THA T IT IS PERFECT , WHOLE, AND COMPLETE JUST AS IT IS. When we awaken to the truth of who we are, all the labels, fears, projections, internal chatter , and self-sabotaging habits fall away to reveal the immeasurable love, compassion, and potential that lies within us all. When we learn to integrate all the broken parts of our human self, we can find harmony within, and our relationship with the external world becomes more peaceful and joyous. Perhaps one of the most powe rful, life-changing messages that I have received is: to heal, we must forgive. Forgiveness carries the light of healing, and when we whole-heartedly forgive, when we surrender to what is, accept what is, and release what is, we create space for transformation.We are spiritua l beings having a human experience, we have only forgotten. \"Always come back to this truth: You are allowed to live a good life. A good life exists for you. And the foundation of a good life is good health. You deserve to heal, to tap into your body's restorative mechanisms. You deserve to be happy and well.\" - ANTHONY WILLIAMi CHAPTER EIGHTEEN The Essential, Life-Changing, and Unknown Angels t is your birthri ght to connect with angels and access help from the Angelic Realm. The angels are here to help guide and support you through difficult times. They have been watching over you since the moment of conception, and they have played a role in keep ing you nourished your entire life. If you have ever doubted their existence, you can be rest assured that angels are not silly new age fluff. They are very real, and they want you to hold faith and trust in their existence so they can help you. They want you to know there is a divine presence in this world, and they also know , now more than ever, they are needed if humankind is to survive and thrive in this toxic and sometimes harsh world that we find ourselves living in. How to Access Angelic Help To ensure you receive help, ask for the angels by name and call upon them out loud. You can't just think it. It could be just a soft whisper; in any instance, it is important that they hear you and see that you are using your own free will. Angels don't want to get stuck in a spiderweb of thoughts, so we need to send them a clear message by asking for their help aloud. Justlike us, angels have free will, and they want to see that we are sincere, committed, and honest, and they want to be taken seriously . If you are deaf, too weak to speak, or you have a speech impediment, you can use sign language or your thoughts to signal the Angel of Deliverance. She will let the other angels know your wishes, and they will take it upon themselves to read your thoughts so they can help. THE THREE KEY THINGS T O KNOW ARE, ANGELS WILL BE THERE T O HELP AS LONG AS YOU ARE FOCUSED ON WHA T YOU ARE CALLING THEM FOR, YOU ARE TRUL Y OPEN T O RECEIVING THEIR HELP , AND YOU HA VE F AITH THA T IT WILL WORK. Archangels like Archangel Michael and Archangel Gabriel are so popular and busy fighting the darkness that they pick jobs that resonate with them the most, which means they might not always be able to meet everyone' s demands. They are so busy going up against the big guns like war and destruction that they sometimes lack the time to assist with other jobs. It's impo rtant to understand that angels work for God, their powers are vast but finite, and they have free will, which makes them susceptible to ego. Fallen ange ls are angels who developed big egos, and they felt they were above God, which, led to them trying to overthrow Him. They are responsible for violence; war and the destruction of our planet and are often behind the darkness. Ever wondered how some people can be so cruel, violent, and lack compassion ? Those people have most likely been influenced by fallen angels and succumbed to the darkness.There is a secret battle raging on our planet between dark and light, and it's important to be aware of which side you sit. When you nourish yourself with healing foods and strengthen your mind, body , and spirit, you will be less susceptible to falling prey to the darkness.

First for yourself and then for others. All of the information within this book that has been referenced to Medical Medium comes from the voice of compassion. Spirit of Compassion . Compassion is closest to God. I am not claimin g these truths as my own because they are not. They come from a higher source. They are Spirit of Compassion' s words given by Anthony W illiam, the Medical Medium. For the past five years, I have been avidly studying the Medical Medium information and the content within certain chapters of this book has transpired from every single Medical Medium book I have read, the many lives, podcasts, and radio shows I have listened to, and the blogs I have read. I have attempted to outline the information to the best of my understanding, and I hope that my words have helped you to understand the Medical Medium information a little better . This book has not only been about Medical Medium information . I have also included all the tools that have helped my daughter and I to heal. Take what is useful for you and leave what doesn' t resonate. We each have the power of free will to carve our own destiny and follow our own path as healers. There is no right or wrong path, and they all lead back to the same place. Healing isn't a linear process, and there is much to this world that can't be seen. I hope by now you believe in your ability to heal, and that you will follow your own intuition which will always guide you to where you need to be for your highest good. Most importantly , hold faith, believe in yourself and your ability to heal. It is your God given right to heal. If I can heal, you can too! Many blessings on your journey .
