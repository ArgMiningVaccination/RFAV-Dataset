Please check back regularly for changes. The final edition and the historical PDF will be published during the fall semester. Undergraduate majors: health studies (BA); exercise science (BS); health promotion (BS); human physiology (BS); sport and recreation management (BS); therapeutic recreation (BS) Undergraduate minors: human physiology; inclusive recreation; lifestyle medicine; sport and recreation management Undergraduate certificate: interscholastic athletic/activities administration Graduate degrees: MA in sport and recreation management; MS in health and human physiology; PhD in health and human physiology Faculty: [https://clas.uiowa.edu/hhp/people/faculty](https://clas.uiowa.edu/hhp/people/faculty) Website: [https://clas.uiowa.edu/hhp/](https://clas.uiowa.edu/hhp/) The Department of Health and Human Physiology offers undergraduate majors, minors, a certificate, and graduate degree programs in health and human physiology and in sport and recreation management. The department administers the Certificate in Disability Studies and collaborates with other departments to offer the Certificate in Event Management, as well as offering coaching authorization courses. In addition, the department is home to the Health and Physical Activity Skills Program (HPAS), which offers courses that provide instruction and practice in lifetime sports, fitness training, and wellness activities aimed at enhancing physical health and well-being. Undergraduates in all majors may use several health and human physiology courses to fulfill requirements of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences [GE CLAS Core](/liberal-arts-sciences/general-education-program/). The department's [First-Year Seminar](https://fys.uiowa.edu/) is designed for entering undergraduate students. Certificates Disability Studies The Department of Health and Human Physiology administers the undergraduate certificate program in disability studies. Disability studies examines disability as a social, cultural, historical, and political phenomenon rather than focusing on its clinical, medical, or therapeutic aspects. It is an interdisciplinary field that draws on scholarship from diverse disciplines. The certificate program helps students expand their knowledge and awareness of disability issues and prepare for careers in public life. See the [Certificate in Disability Studies](/liberal-arts-sciences/disability-studies/certificate/) in the catalog. Event Management The departments of Health and Human Physiology and Communication Studies, the School of Journalism and Mass Communication (College of Liberal Arts and Sciences), and the Department of Marketing (Tippie College of Business), collaborate to offer the undergraduate Certificate in Event Management. Students who earn the certificate will know and be able to demonstrate the basic principles of organizing a successful event. They will gain a robust understanding of the diverse field of event management and careers in the event management industry. For information, see the [Certificate in Event Management](/liberal-arts-sciences/event-management/event-management-certificate/) in the catalog.

They provide excellent facilities for instruction and research at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. Cooperative efforts with other units facilitate specialization by allowing Department of Health and Human Physiology students to use additional special facilities and research equipment in other departments on campus (e.g., biology, biochemistry and molecular biology, molecular physiology and biophysics, orthopedic surgery, internal medicine, pharmacology, and the College of Engineering).
