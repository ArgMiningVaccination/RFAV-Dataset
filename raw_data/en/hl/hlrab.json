In the 1920s when Dr. Rudolf Hauschka was a young chemist, he met Rudolf Steiner and asked the esteemed philosopher, educator and founder of Anthroposophy, \"What is life?\" Steiner offered Dr. Hauschka the advice that led him to make a groundbreaking discovery: \"Study rhythm, rhythm carries life.\" Rhythm in our products. Inspired by Steiner's comment, Dr. Hauschka developed a procedure exposing plants to the rhythmic powers of the natural polarities of darkness and light, warmth and cold, movement and rest, to preserve botanical extracts without the use of alcohol. We still use this rhythmic process to produce our extracts, essences and tinctures. All the ingredients in our natural, organic, biodynamic and/or wild-harvested skin care products are processed using Dr. Hauschka's original processing procedure to varying degrees. This unique method preserves the high vitality of our precious ingredients and helps ensure their benefits reach your skin in their most potent state possible. Supporting your skin's natural rhythms. Rhythmic activity is not an end in itself however when your skin's natural rhythms are supported by the right products and methods, a beautiful, healthy complexion can follow. Like all living beings, human, plant and animal, your body recognises and experiences different rhythms: Dr. Hauschka Signature Cleansing combines [Cleansing Cream](https://www.drhauschka.com.au/face-care/cleansing-cream)with a rhythmic 'press and roll' movement to signal and activate your skin's natural cleansing processes. Your skin naturally renews itself every 28 days. Our [Conditioners and Intensive Treatments](https://www.drhauschka.com.au/face-care)are formulated to work with these rhythms to guide skin to a balanced, radiant state. We consider the skin's natural day/night rhythm by offering protective care during the day and help it regenerate at night with stimuli-packed night care. By day, our moisturisers nourish and protect your skin when it is at its least active. At night when your skin is most active, [Toners and Serums or Conditioners or Intensive Treatments](https://www.drhauschka.com.au/face-care)harness the skin's inherent regenerative powers so they work to greater effect and results. [Dr. Hauschka Estheticians](https://www.drhauschka.com.au/stockists-1)perform our [Classic Facial Treatment](https://www.drhauschka.com.au/dr-hauschka-holistic-treatment-list?rq=classic%20treatment)using carefully orchestrated stroking of the skin to stimulate the lymph. This treatment is much more than a facial, leaving you with a sense of harmony and vitality. By harnessing the powers of rhythm, Dr. Hauschka natural skin care products are able to deliver their properties directly to your skin so it best benefits from the ingredients, and you can see and feel the results they provide. Rhythm provides connection. In addition to the above, we also regard rhythm as a means of establishing contact. Not only with our own bodies but also with the world around us. And we do this at regular intervals. We get in contact with creative minds and inspired free spirits and ask them for their views on our brand. And on all the topics that affect and drive us with their very own rhythm. Artistically. Contagiously. And always differently. One moving result is this very rhythmic interpretation of Dr. Hauschka natural cosmetics, a film devised by the agency Heimat. The creative minds use dance to present a brand that is in complete harmony with the rhythm of nature. Dr. Hauschka Quality Truly 100% natural and/or organic skin care and make-up, NATRUE certified.
