We're removing copayments, co-insurance, or deductibles for all medically necessary COVID-19-related care. Any medically necessary treatment for COVID-19 is covered under a member's health plan within the United States or internationally. We're also removing member cost share (copayments, co-insurance, and deductibles) for COVID-19-related inpatient care at both in- and out-of-network acute care facilities for our fully insured members. Simply arrange for your care as always, and your claims will be processed to reflect these waived costs.

In the meantime, members can manually submit claims to their financial account administrator for reimbursement. Important note: Plans vary by employer, and these changes don't necessarily change the benefits available under an employer's plan. Members should review plan documents carefully or consult their employers for information about their companies' benefits.
