Acupuncture is an all-natural method of promoting healing, used across East Asia for thousands of years. Modern scientific research has demonstrated that it is effective in treating pain, regulating the nervous system and enhancing immunity. How does acupuncture work? Acupuncture involves the use of needles to stimulate nerve rich areas of the skin. This stimulation releases natural pain killing substances (endogenous opioids) and increases parasympathetic activity, the branch of the nervous system associated with rest, digestion, and tissue repair. Acupuncture also improves blood flow and reduces inflammation. What does acupuncture treat? Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in a wide range of conditions. After completing a series of treatments, most patients experience lasting relief and an improved quality of life. Acupuncture Conditions We Treat - Pain: Arthritis, neck pain, low back pain, sciatica, shoulder pain, hip pain, knee pain, carpal tunnel, post-surgical pain, fibromyalgia - Neurological: Headaches, migraines, poor memory, neuropathy, insomnia, hot flashes, anxiety, depression - Digestive disorders: Nausea and vomiting, acid reflux, constipation, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - Immune conditions: Allergies, asthma, fatigue, rhinitis, Crohn's Disease and ulcerative colitis - Cancer treatment side effects: The side effects of chemotherapy and radiation - such as nausea, neuropathy, fatigue, hot flashes, neutropenia (low white blood cell count) and pain - respond well to acupuncture and Integrative Medicine. We partner with your oncologist to ensure that you are feeling your best at every stage of your journey through survivorship. - Post-COVID-19 Recovery: Many patients diagnosed with COVID-19 experience persistent, long term symptoms even months after their infection. Survivors of COVID-19 may experience fatigue, shortness of breath, trouble concentrating or \"brain fog\", joint pain, digestive issues along with other ailments. Acupuncture and Integrative Medicine can help improve these symptoms and hasten your recovery. Who Performs Acupuncture?
