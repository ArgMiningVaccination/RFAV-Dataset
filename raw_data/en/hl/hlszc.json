UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Introduction to UCI The University of California David Pierpont Gardner President The University of California was chartered as the State's only Land Grant College in 1868. Throughout its first decades, the University's development was strongly influ\u00ad enced by leading educators and scholars from various parts of the country. Supported by the State and many generous benefactors, the University was responsive to the needs of California while progressing on a steady climb toward emi\u00ad nence in academic and scientific achievement. Today the University system includes nine campuses: Berke\u00ad ley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Diego, San Francisco, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz. All of the cam\u00ad puses adhere to the same admissions guidelines and high aca\u00ad demic standards, yet each one has its own distinct character. Among the campuses there are five medical schools, three law schools, and a school of veterinary medicine, as well as professional schools of business administration, education, engineering, oceanography, and many others. The Universi\u00ad ty's libraries are among the finest in the United States; the collections of the more than 100 University of California libraries on the nine campuses are surpassed in size on the American continent only by the Library of Congress collection. In just over a century, the University has become one of the world's largest and most renowned centers of higher educa\u00ad tion. The faculty is internationally noted for its distinguished academic achievements. On its nine campuses, the University has a total of 19 Nobel laureates. National Academy of Sci\u00ad ence membership on all campuses numbers more than 200, greater than any other college or university system. The University maintains a variety of research facilities, agri\u00ad cultural field stations, and extension centers in more than 100 locations throughout California. Public services include medical and dental clinics, information services for agricul\u00ad tural and urban populations, and a broad program of continu\u00ad ing education for adults in the arts, business, and professions. Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy and with support from other agencies, the University operates three national research facilities: the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory adjoining the Berkeley campus; the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory at Livermore, California; and the Los Alamos National Laboratory at Los Alamos, New Mexico. Other major research facilities include Lick Observa\u00ad tory, White Mountain Research Station for high-altitude research, Laboratory of Radio Astronomy, Bodega Marine Laboratory, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Institute of Transportation Studies, Statewide Air Pollution Research Center, Space Sciences Laboratory, Hormone Research Cen\u00ad ter, and Philip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Cen\u00ad ter, among others. One of the University's unique resources is its roster of Uni\u00ad versity Professors. The University Professor title is reserved for certain distinguished faculty members who are recog\u00ad nized nationally and internationally as scholars and teachers of exceptional ability. A University Professor may visit a number of University of California campuses during the aca\u00ad demic year, holding conferences with students and staff and speaking before general public audiences. A list of University Professors may be found on page 333. University Administration. Under the State Constitution, governance of the University is entrusted to the Board of Regents. The Regents appoint the President of the Univer\u00ad sity, and with the President's advice, appoint the Chancellors, Directors of major laboratories, Provosts, and Deans who administer the affairs of the individual campuses and other divisions of the University. Authority in academic matters is delegated by The Regents to the Academic Senate, which determines academic policy for the University as a whole. The Board of Regents includes seven ex officio board members, and 23 regular members who are appointed by the Governor for 12-year terms after consultation with an ad\u00ad visory committee. In addition, The Regents appoint a student Regent for a one-year term as a voting Board member with full rights of participation. The chair and vice chair of the Academic Council serve as faculty representatives to the Board and participate fully in all discussions. A constitutional amendment provides that \"Regents shall be able persons broadly reflective of the economic, cultural, and social diver\u00ad sity of the State, including ethnic minorities and women.\" They shall have \"full powers of organization and govern\u00ad ment, subject only to such legislative controls as may be necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the endowments of the University and the security of its funds.\" The President is executive head of the total institution. Each of the nine campuses has a Chancellor as its chief administra\u00ad tive officer. The Chancellor is responsible for the organiza\u00ad tion and operation of the campus, including academic, stu\u00ad dent, and business affairs. For the names of University Regents, Officers, and Chancellors, see page 332. The Academic Senate, consisting of faculty and certain admi\u00ad nistrative officers, determines the conditions for admission and degrees, subject to the approval of The Regents, autho\u00ad rizes and supervises courses and curricula, and advises the University administration on the important matters of faculty appointments and promotions and budgets. Students participate in policymaking at both the campus and Universitywide levels. The Irvine Campus Jack W. Peltason Chancellor The University of California, Irvine has achieved distinction nationally and internationally because of the high quality of its programs, faculty, and alumni. The campus challenges its students both academically and personally and relies on the commitment, curiosity, imagination, and judgment of faculty and students to assure its continued intellectual and cultural vitality. Since the campus opened in 1965, enrollment has grown to approximately 14,500, including 11,900 undergrad\u00ad uate students, 1,600 graduate students, and 1,100 medical \u00b7 students and residents as of fall 1985. ' UCI is committed to the pursuit and transmission of knowl\u00ad edge. It makes available to its students opportunities for gain\u00ad ing knowledge, training, skills, and credentials which in turn can provide the basis for enhanced social and economic opportunities. With regard to making these opportunities available to all students, UCI has the responsibility to estab\u00ad lish and implement programs that go beyond legal minimums to ens\u00b7ure that all qualified segments of the public have access and equal opportunity to participate in the University's aca\u00ad demic programs. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988The Irvine Campus 5 Classroom buildings, research facilities, and residence halls radiate outward from Aldrich Park, a 21-acre retreat in the center of campus. UC IRVINE - 1987-19886 The Irvine Campus Academic Goals UCI offers programs designed to provide students with a foundation on which to continue developing their intellec\u00ad tual, aesthetic, and moral capacities. The programs and cur\u00ad ricula are based on the belief that a student's collective Univer\u00ad sity experience should provide understanding and insight which are the basis for an intellectual identity and life-long learning. An important aspect of the educational approach at UCI is the emphasis placed on student involvement in independent study, research, and the creative process as a complement to classroom study. Independent research in laboratories, field study, involvement in writing workshops, and participation in fine arts productions are normal elements of the UCI expe\u00ad rience. In many departments special programs and courses which involve students in original research and creative activ\u00ad ities are integrated into the curriculum. The Irvine campus provides an atmosphere conducive to creative work and scholarship at all levels, to the exploration of the accumulated knowledge of mankind, and to the devel\u00ad opment of new knowledge through basic and applied research. Along with these objectives, Irvine has a serious commitment to public service. The campus generates research expertise which may be applied to regional and national social issues, and seeks to provide humanistic under\u00ad standing of the problems of society. Academic Structure Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on funda\u00ad mental areas of knowledge, and at the same time provide for interdisciplinary and professional study. Five basic Schools represent five fundamental areas of knowledge: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional studies are offered in the Department of Information and Computer Science, the Program in Social Ecology, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, and the Office of Teacher Education. The UCI-California Col\u00ad lege of Medicine provides educational programs for medical and health sciences graduate students, medical residents, and practicing physicians. Programs in physical education, recrea\u00ad tion, and intercollegiate athletics are provided by the Department of Physical Education. The Office of Academic Affairs has responsibility for all pro\u00ad grams of instruction and research. It, as well as the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and the Office of Under\u00ad graduate Studies, report directly to the Executive Vice Chan\u00ad cellor. Matters of educational policy, including approval of programs, courses, and grades, are the responsibility of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. The Irvine Division is part of the Academic Senate of the University of California. The Office of the Vice Chancellor Student Affairs provides students with a range of services and programs designed to create an environment which is supportive of an educational endeavor of the highest quality. Student Affairs programs and services offer students the opportunity to supplement their formal educational experience by becoming involved in diverse aspects of the University. Such programs and services can broaden the student's University experience by providing opportunities for personal development in addition to intel\u00ad lectual growth. The Dean of Undergraduate Studies provides leadership in developing policies and programs which serve the academic needs of the undergraduate student population and affect the retention of students, including underrepresented and cui-turally diverse student populations. Undergraduate Studies provides administrative oversight for undergraduate academ\u00ad ically related concerns which require campus-level attention and coordination and which do not come under the direct authority of the heads of academic units or the Irvine Divi\u00ad sion of the Academic Senate. The following programs and services are administered by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies: (1) the Pro\u00ad gram of Academic Support Services (PASS), which coordi\u00ad nates placement testing, student tracking, the Learning Skills Center, and the Tutorial Assistance Program; (2) the Educa\u00ad tion Abroad Program; (3) the Special Services Program, which provides services to targeted populations; (4) the coor\u00ad dination and enhancement of campus academic advising with special responsibility for the advising of unaffiliated students (undeclared majors) and the coordination of the Peer Aca\u00ad demic Advising Program; (5) the coordination of the Honors Program; and (6) Instructional Development Services which supports the inprovement of teaching and innovation in learning within the UCI community. The Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies has general administrative responsibility for graduate education and research. In the area of research, the Vice Chancellor is responsible for research policy development, implementation, and oversight. In graduate education, the Dean of Graduate Studies serves as the academic dean for all graduate students and is responsible for admissions, enrolled student services, graduate student support, and the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minority students and women in graduate education. Accreditation The University of California, Irvine is a member of the West\u00ad ern Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The cam\u00ad pus is fully accredited by the Senior Commission of WASC. This accreditation requires periodic review in accord with WASC policies and standards. In addition, the undergraduate degree program of the Department of Chemistry is accred\u00ad ited by the American Chemical Society; the undergraduate programs offered by the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology; the M.D. program of the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine is accredited by the Liaison Committee of the Association of American Medical Colleges and the American Medical Association; the Graduate School of Management is accredited by the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business; and the credential programs of the Office of Teacher Education are approved by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing. Phi Beta Kappa Phi Beta Kappa, founded in 1776, maintains a chapter at UCI. Phi Beta Kappa is the nation's oldest and most prestigious honor society; it recognizes outstanding scholastic achieve\u00ad ment in the liberal arts and sciences. Upper-division students whose undergraduate records fulfill certain requirements are eligible for election to membership. Further information can be obtained from the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, 256 Administration Building. Affirmative Action Office The UCI Affirmative Action Office develops and supports\u00b7 programs which promote affirmative action and equal oppor\u00ad tunity in University employment, services, and education for qualified minorities, women, handicapped persons, and Viet- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988nam Era veterans. Additionally, the Office implements sys\u00ad tems and procedures designed to facilitate compliance with Titles VI and VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act and Title IX of the Educational Amendments to the Act. The Office is responsible for assuring fair and equal treat\u00ad ment in University admissions policies, educational programs and activities, and in both undergraduate and graduate stu\u00ad dent affirmative action programs. The Office also assists in the coordination of student affirmative action plans. For further information, contact the UCI Affirmative Action Office, 117 Administration Building, (714) 856-5594. Ombudsman The campus Ombudsman is available to assist students, faculty, and staff with any problems or concerns they may encounter while at UCI, including those related to student conduct and discipline (see p. 333). The Ombudsman responds to concerns presented by campus individuals and group members by clarifying issues or concerns; making appropriate on-and off-campus referrals for student, faculty, and staff members; and providing a confidential, impartial, and informal setting for grievance problem resolution. The Ombudsman is located in 260 Administration Building, tele\u00ad phone (714) 856-7256. The Campus Setting UCI's location offers the cultural and economic resources of an urban area along with access to the scenic, recreational areas of Southern California. Located 40 miles south of Los Angeles, five miles from the Pacific Ocean, and nestled in 1,510 acres of coastal foothills near Newport Beach, UCI lies amid rapidly growing residential communities and a dynamic national and multinational business and industrial complex that affords many employment opportunities. Even so, the campus remains an oasis of green-a natural arboretum planted with trees and shrubs from all over the world. Adja\u00ad cent to the campus lies UCI's outdoor laboratory, the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, which is home to a wide variety of migratory and nonmigratory water fowl and other wildlife. The UCI Medical Center, located in the City of Orange on a 33-acre site, is a major teaching hospital for the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine. UCI is adjacent to University Town Center, a commercial center which is linked to the campus by a pedestrian bridge. Town Center facilities include a movie theatre complex, res\u00ad taurants, apartments, a post office, a video/record store, a stereo store, a one-hour photographic service, a copy service, clothing stores, an art gallery, a dispensing optician, gift shops, ice cream and sandwich parlors, and a cookie store. In addition, the Town Center is anchored by a 10-story office building which houses private business enterprises as well as several University administrative offices. Within a few miles of the campus are major department stores; branches of world-renowned boutiques; dozens of outstanding restaurants, many offering cuisines from a vari\u00ad ety of other countries; and major hotels. Cultural opportuni\u00ad ties include repertory theatres, orchestras, choral groups, dance companies, galleries, and museums. The John Wayne Airport is two miles from campus. Yet, in part, the Irvine area retains some of its traditional character as a beach although not a sleepy resort. The Portu\u00ad guese dory fishing fleet at Newport, one of the last private fleets on the West Coast, comes ashore every morning and evening to sell the day's catch, and the sun and surf crowd mingle with the art and artisan crowd at Laguna Beach dur\u00ad ing the summer and winter festivals. The Irvine Campus 7 The temperate, Mediterranean climate stimulates year-round water-oriented activities such as windsurfing, sailing, and tidepooling. The spring, summer, fall, and winter find stu\u00ad dents, many of whom live in the nearby beach communities of Balboa Island, Balboa Peninsula, and Newport Beach\u00ad enjoying the warm sun and gentle sea breezes. Boating enthusiasts set sail in Newport Bay in 14-or 30-foot sailboats or in canoes, available from the UCI Sailing Club. Local mountain and desert recreation areas are within easy reach, and the UCI Cooperative Outdoor Program provides low\u00ad cost rental equipment for hiking and skiing, and instruction for other recreational pursuits. The metropolitan attractions of Los Angeles and San Diego are approximately an hour's drive from the campus. Bus transportation between the campus and major housing areas, shopping centers, and beaches is convenient, and bicy\u00ad cling is popular. Both the campus and the surrounding com\u00ad munities are designed to encourage bicycle traffic, and trails connect UCI to many student housing areas and to the waterfront areas of Newport Beach. Instructional and Research Facilities University Library Calvin J. Boyer University Librarian The UCI Library is a component of the extensive University of California Library system, whose libraries contain more than 20 million volumes. These libraries are committed to a resource-sharing plan which will strengthen the resource base and usefulness of UCI's own library system. Established in 1963, the UCI Library collection has been carefully selected and developed in conjunction with the campus academic plan. The UCI Library system includes the Main Library, the Phys\u00ad ical Sciences Library, and the Biomedical Library and its branches. This important resource for study, teaching, and research contains more than 1,200,000 volumes, including almost 18,500 currently active serials subscriptions. Except for those materials which comprise the Medical Center Branch Library, all of these volumes are housed on the gen\u00ad eral campus. In addition, a student may request books from other University of California libraries and from other librar\u00ad ies throughout the world. The Main Library is designed to provide maximum shelving and reader space. With the exception of materials housed in special units, all periodicals and books are on open shelves and easily accessible to all readers. The following Library departments provide specialized services to the users of the Main Library. The Reference department maintains an open-shelf collection of approximately 22,000 volumes. Librarians in the Reference Department assist in the use of reference materials and pro\u00ad vide information on a wide variety of topics to campus and community users. The Department has numerous guides and handouts available to assist users in both general and special\u00ad ized library research. In addition to offering a formal course in library research techniques (Humanities 75: Bibliostra\u00ad tegy), the Department provides course-related instruction and general orientations to the Library and makes available individual research consultations with appropriate subject specialists. The Department also offers the fee-based Computer-Assisted Reference Service (CARS).

Research The University of California, Irvine is among the leading 65 research universities in the United States. In 1985-86 UCI received more than $51 million from federal and state agen\u00ad cies and private organizations for the support of basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. One of UCI's goals is to rank among the top 50 research universities in the country by the end of this decade. Research is an inte\u00ad gral part of all schools and departments, and many of UCI's research programs have achieved national and international distinction for their work. The research programs at UCI have a positive impact on both undergraduate and graduate education. Research is critical to graduate education because of the research-oriented nature of doctoral study. At the undergraduate level, research at UCI provides undergraduate students with access to a faculty made up of researchers at the forefront of their fields. As a consequence, the knowledge received by ucr students is the latest and most up-to-date available. The Research and Grad\u00ad uate Studies section (see p. 77) describes organized research activities, organizations, and resources. Natural Reserves System The University of California manages and maintains a sys\u00ad tem of 26 land and water reserves that are representative of the State's habitat and geographic diversity. These serve as outdoor laboratories for students, faculty, and staff, and are The Irvine Campus 9 Professor Vartkess Apkarian. Department of Chemistry. studies photodynamics in condensed ma/ler.

For further information, telephone (714) 856-5139. Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project Financed through private and federal funds, the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae (TLG) Project began in 1972. Project goals are to create the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae, a data bank of Greek literature from its Homeric beginnings to approxi\u00ad mately A.D. 600; to conduct literary research using collected texts; and to apply technological innovation in these en\u00ad deavors. TLG research activities combine the traditional con\u00ad cerns and methodologies of philological and literary study with the most advanced features of computer technology. Included among current research foci are the identification of ancient Greek literary and documentary materials from vari\u00ad ous literary-historical periods; the conversion of these mate\u00ad the enhancement of auto\u00ad mated text-verification routines; and the examination of criteria for data-capture of \"nonstandard\" source materials such as nonliterary (e.g., documentary) texts. TLG staff are establishing procedures to facilitate nationwide access to data-barik resources at UCI. The data bank currently contains more than 57 million words of Greek text and is expected to grow to 62 million words. The Project's close ties with the Department of Classics are evidenced by faculty participation in TLG research and TLG support of graduate students. In addition, TLG's library hold\u00ad ings enhance those of the University Library, and TLG\u00ad related conferences and scholarly visits afford faculty and students contacts with eminent classists. The Project has made UCI a major source of classics research activity. UCI Medical Center and Community CliniCs The UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) is one of five teaching hospitals owned and operated by the University of California. It is located on a 33-acre site in the City of Orange. UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine faculty and resident physi\u00ad cians are the professional staff for medical services at the Center. UCIMC maintains inpatient and outpatient services in virtually all medical specialties and is fully accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. The Medical Center provides the only designated comprehensive emer\u00ad gency service in Orange County; it is also the designated County Level I tertiary trauma referral center. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988The Center serves as a principal facility for teaching and research programs for the UCI-California College of Medi\u00ad cine. Licensed for 493 beds, the Medical Center currently serves 17,100 inpatient admissions, 168,700 outpatient visits, and 40,300 adult and pediatric emergency visits. The availability of advanced technology and the nationally recognized expertise of members of the staff have made UCI Medical Center a regional referral center for the diagnosis and treatment of many medical problems. UCIMC is nation\u00ad ally recognized for its burn center and expertise in the surgi\u00ad cal replantation of severed limbs. In addition, the Medical Center offers special programs for high-risk pregnant women and critically ill babies. The 24-hour Regional Poison Center provides services not available at other hospitals in Orange County. Other services include multidisciplinary car\u00ad diology and oncology programs and a comprehensive psychia\u00ad try program for adults, adolescents, and children. UCIMC also is one of the primary centers for the comprehensive management of diabetes. In addition, the Medical Center has received federal approval for the use of lasers in the treat\u00ad ment of cancers of the head, neck, and female reproductive system, and for cardiovascular disease. Programs in research and patient care using laser technology are coordinated by the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic, located on the UCI campus. A major redevelopment program has been designed to enhance the professional facilities and environmental setting of the Medical Center. An addition to the outpatient building was completed in 1980 and houses the orthopedic and family practice clinics. In 1981, the six-story Medical Center Tower was opened, housing diagnostic radiology services, emer\u00ad gency and trauma facilities, obstetrical facilities, and private and semiprivate patient rooms. Redevelopment of the Medi\u00ad cal Center site also has included construction of the Medical Sciences Library.

For further information, please contact the Office of New Student Ser\u00ad vices, (714) 856-6345. University Program for High School Scholars The University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) is an opportunity for selected highly prepared and gifted high school students (primarily seniors) to utilize UCI's nationally acknowledged academic resources while still in high school. Participants enroll concurrently at UCI and participate in campus activities, interacting with faculty and students and pursuing academic interests beyond those which may be part of the high school curriculum. Participants receive grades based on the same standards as full-time UCI students and full University credit for their work. Students must meet course prerequisites where applicable. Qualified students wishing to pursue a particular subject beyond the level offered by the high school may find the advanced courses they need at the University, or perhaps courses of interest not offered at the high school. Not only . does UPHSS afford the gifted high school student a source of intellectual stimulation beyond that which the resources of the high school might allow, it also serves to provide the stu\u00ad dent with an insider's view of the academic environment that UCI has to offer. For further information, please refer to page 36. How to Use the Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, descriptions of schools and departments and their curricula, and descriptions of student activities and services. Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. The selection of courses to be offered each quarter is subject to change without notice, and some listed courses are not offered each year. The quarterly Schedule of Classes, a pub\u00ad lication available from the Registrar's Office shortly before registration begins each quarter, provides more current information on classes to be offered, instructors, how to enroll, enrollment restrictions (for example, open to majors only, or consent of instructor required), class hours, room assignments, and final examination schedules. Students should consult the appropriate academic unit for even more up-to-date information. Admission to UCI does not guaran\u00ad tee enrollment in any particular course. Please refer to Major Campus Publications (see p. 54). Presentation of information in the UCI General Catalogue is divided into five main concepts (details are found in the Table of Contents): 1. Introduction to UCI 2. Preadmission Matters 3. Information for Admitted Students 4. Information on the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. UC IRVINE - 1987-198814 Preparing for University Work 5. Schools and Programs: Instruction and research programs at UCI focus on five fundamental areas of knowledge, while at the same time providing for interdisciplinary and profes\u00ad sional study. In the Catalogue, the five basic Schools are presented first: Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Physical Sciences, and Social Sciences. Programs covering interdisciplinary and professional studies are presented next: Information and Computer Science, Social Ecology, Engineer\u00ad ing, Management, Medicine, and Teacher Education. The program in physical education, recreation, and intercollegiate athletics is presented last. Included in the academic unit descriptions are the following kinds of information: a. A brief description of what areas are covered in the school or program and a brief statement of the educational philoso\u00ad phy and orientation of the unit. b. Lists of faculty members, the institutions from which they received their highest degrees, and their academic areas of interest. c. Requirements for the undergraduate and graduate degrees offered including those for majors and minors offered. d. Additional areas of study offered (referred to as majors, minors, concentrations, specializations, emphases, tracks, modules, or options). e. Advice about planning a program of study, and other information relevant to the academic progress and experience of students majoring in fields within each School or Program. f. Courses offered, divided into undergraduate and graduate course listings; those units that are departmentalized present their courses according to the department. Course Listings Undergraduate courses are classified as \"lower division\" and refers to courses numbered 100- 199. Courses numbered 200 and above are graduate courses. \"Lower division\" usually refers to freshman-sophomore courses, \"upper division\" to junior-senior courses. However, junior and senior students may take lower-division courses, and freshmen and sophomores may normally take upper\u00ad division courses when upper-division standing is not a pre\u00ad requisite and when any course prerequisites have been met. Prerequisites for courses should be noted carefully; a course has no prerequisites unless indicated. Courses with sequential designations (for example, lA-B-C) normally indicate multiple-quarter courses; except as noted, each course in a sequence is prerequisite to the one following. The letter L following a course number usually designates a laboratory course. The \"(4)\" or \"(4-4-4)\" designation following the course title indicates the unit credits toward the 180 quarter units needed to graduate. Each\" 4\" represents four quarter units. Some courses give other than four units of credit; for example, five, two, or a range of one to twelve units can be granted. The letters F, W, or S after the course number and title indi\u00ad cate the quarter(s) in which the course will be offered: fall, winter, or spring. The word \"Summer\" appears if the course is offered in Summer Session of the academic year covered by this issue of the UCI General Catalogue. While efforts have been made to provide information on when a course is offered, such information is not always available in time for inclusion in the Catalogue. The designation (4) F, W, S indi\u00ad cates a single course offered that can be taken only once for credit; a (4-4-4) F, W, S designation indicates that credit may be earned in each quarter. When a course is approved for satisfaction of the UCI breadth requirement, the breadth category is indicated by a roman numeral in parentheses at the end of the course description. Preparing for University Work A carefully planned program of high school courses provides students with the best preparation for University work, as it establishes a solid basis for undergraduate studies, gives more options for later study, and provides opportunities for more specialized preparation for a chosen field of study. Stu\u00ad dents need to master certain basic subjects and skills before entering the University so as to increase the likelihood of doing well in University courses. Students may also wish to consider gaining additional preparation at a community col\u00ad lege and applying to enter the University as a transfer appli\u00ad cant (see p. 00). Students planning to enter the University must complete the high school courses required for admission (the \"a through f\" requirements, see p. 00). Careful thought should be given to adequate preparation in the basic skills of reading, writing, and mathematics described in detail below. In addition, con\u00ad sideration should be given to deciding on a general field of study that might be pursued at the University, so that related college-preparatory elective courses can be taken in high school. A high school counselor or teacher can help select the appropriate courses. The \"a through f\" requirements for admission to the Univer\u00ad sity of California are minimum entrance standards. Complet\u00ad ing the required high school courses with satisfactory grades will not by itself prepare students for freshman work in every subject, much less in a major or program of study. Many entering students discover that they are not ade\u00ad quately prepared for basic University courses, such as English composition or calculus, which they are expected to take in their freshman year. Also, many undergraduate majors, par\u00ad ticularly those in the sciences, engineering, and mathematics, require more high school preparation than that necessary for admission to the University. This lack of preparation can cause problems for students who do not choose a major until after they enter the University, or for those who prepare for one major but later decide to change to another. For these reasons, students should take courses that will pre\u00ad pare them beyond minimum levels of competence both in subject matter content and in general academic skills. This often means selecting the most challenging courses in the basic subjects that are offered in high school. Such courses may be part of an honors program or may be regular courses taught at a challenging level. A good preparation for Univer\u00ad sity work includes English every semester in high school; three to four years of mathematics, including a course in the senior year; two to three years of foreign language; two to three years of laboratory science with content from biology, chemistry, and physics; two or more years of history and social studies; and one or more courses in fine arts (visual or performing). It is important to appreciate that good study skills and study habits are essential for doing well at the University. These are developed in the more advanced courses in high school that encourage independent, out-of-class work using library and other resources. University courses often assume that background material is fresh in the student's mind and tho\u00ad roughly mastered. It is expected that students know how to read a textbook effectively, how to seek help from other UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Preparing for University Work 15 Group discussion .sessions:a;e often pari of the larger class lectures and provide st~denls with the ;pporlunily to discuss ideas in more casual sellings. books, how tp take notes from books or lectures, how to edit and revise a paper, and how to plan a realistic study schedule. It is especially important to take a full academic load during the senior year\u00b7 to be ready for the challenge of University work. Advanced honors-level or advanced placement courses for which students have prerequisites are strongly recom\u00ad mended. Students should be aware that in calculating grade point averages for determining minimum eligibility for admission, the University uses only the best grades obtained in the \"a through f\". subjects. However, if a student applies to a campus or program that receives applications from more eligible students than can be accommodated, all grades received in academic courses taken beyond the ninth grade will be important. Reading Many students are not prepared for either the kinds or amounts of reading demanded of freshmen at the University. Each student should become proficient in reading and under\u00ad standing technical materials and scholarly works and should learn to read analytically and critically, actively questioning the author's intentions, viewpoint, arguments, and conclu\u00ad sions. Students also should become familiar and comfortable with the conventions of standard written English and with various writing strategies and techniques. Reading expe\u00ad rience should include original works in their entirety, not just textbooks and anthologies, and should encompass a wide variety of forms and topics. Writing Effective critical thinking and proficiency with the written language are closely related, and both are skills which every University student must master. By University standards, a student who is proficient in English composition is able to (a) understand the assigned topic; (b) select and develop a theme by argument and example; (c) choose words which aptly and precisely convey the intended meaning; (d) con\u00ad struct effective sentences, i.e., sentences that economically and successfully convey the writer's ideas and display a vari\u00ad ety of structures; (e) demonstrate an awareness of the con-ventions of standard written English, avoiding such errors as sentence fragments, run-together sentences, faulty agree\u00ad ments, and improper pronoun references; and (f) punctuate, capitalize, and spell correctly. A student planning to attend the University must take Eng\u00ad lish courses in high school that require the development and pradice of these skills. University entrance requirements include at least four years of English composition and litera\u00ad ture that stress expository writing: the development of per\u00ad suasive critical thinking on the written page. Mathematics Many students are unaware of the large number of fields of study that require preparation in mathematics beyond the minimum three-year requirement for admission to the Uni\u00ad versity. Courses in calculus are included in the requirements for all majors in engineering; the physical, mathematical, and life sciences; as well as programs leading to professional degrees in fields such as medicine, dentistry, optometry, or pharmacy. Many majors in the social sciences require statis\u00ad tics or calculus, or both. Students should prepare for these courses while in high school so that the appropriate mathema,tics courses can be taken in the freshman year at the University. Thus the high school program should include a year of precalculus mathe\u00ad matics. This year should provide additional practice in the use of second-year algebra and should include experience with trigonometry, logarithmic and exponential functions with applications and word problems. Students who are not proficient in understanding basic and intermediate algebra and solving problems using these con\u00ad cepts will be at an enormous disadvantage in a number of majors at the University. One or more precalculus courses will have to be completed before beginning calculus, and pre\u00ad paratory courses may be needed before taking statistics. The necessity to take these preparatory courses can seriously delay progress in undergraduate studies.

UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Undergraduate Majors, Minors, Concentrations, and Associated Areas of Study Undergraduate majors are offered in all of the bachelor's degree programs on the list of degree titles; the degree pro\u00ad grams are referred to as majors in the following list. In asso\u00ad ciation with these majors, UCI offers a number of minors and formal concentrations. Some concentrations are ava.ilable in more than one academic unit. A minor consists of a coordinated set of courses (seven or more) which together take a student well beyond the intro\u00ad ductory level in an academic field, subject matter, and/or dis\u00ad cipline but which are not sufficient to constitute a major. Minors are listed on a student's transcript but are not listed on the baccalaureate diploma. A concentration is a program of interdisciplinary study con\u00ad sisting of courses offered by two or more schools or pro\u00ad grams. Concentrations are similar to minors in that they require fewer units of work than majors do, and the area of co-ncentration pursued by a student appears on the transcript but not on the baccalaureate diploma. Concentrations are usually taken in combination with a major in one of the schools or programs offering the concentration. In addition to the formal minors and concentrations, other associated areas of study are available.' These include speciali\u00ad zations, which enable students to focus courses in a particu\u00ad lar field within a major, and emphases, tracks, modules, or options. Students are urged to become informed of and understand all requirements concerning their intended majors, minors, con\u00ad centrations, and/or associated areas of study. Special restric\u00ad tions apply to some majors and minbrs; for example, some minors require formal application or declaration by students. Other minors may be completed without such formalities.

Administrative Services Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis Early Childhood Education Specialist Multiple Subject Instruction (elementary) Pupil Personnel Services Single Subject Instruction (secondary) Special Education (learning handicapped; physically handi\u00ad capped; severely handicapped; and the resource specialist certificate) Majors and Careers Choosing a Major Many students select their University major the field of study which represents their principal academic interest at the time they fill out their University of California Under\u00ad graduate Application. Some students, however, are not ready to choose a major at the time they apply, and still others may wish to change to a different major after they have enrolled. In preparation for choosing a major, students need to famil\u00ad iarize themselves as much as possible with UCI and its many programs. Entering students are exposed to a wide range of areas of study, and it is not unusual for students to become enthusiastic about academic disciplines previously unfamiliar to them. Much depends on initiative on how fully a student takes advantage of opportunities that come through sugges\u00ad tions for further study and through informal communication with faculty and students. The UCI General Catalogue is a good place to find specific information about programs available, requirements for majors, and course offerings. At UCI a number of tradition\u00ad ally separate academic disciplines have strong interrelation\u00ad ships, so that the academic environment is influenced by a wide range of interactions among disciplines. As a comple\u00ad ment to classroom study, UCI encourages its students to become involved in a variety of educational experiences such as independent study, laboratory research, field study, writing workshops, computing, and fine arts productions. Majors and Careers 19 Students, staff, and other campus community members cultivate plots of produce and flowers in the garden adjacent to Mesa Court, one of UCI's residence halls. In addition to consulting the Catalogue, students are encour\u00ad aged to talk to academic counselors and faculty advisors about the opportunities which are open to them. They may go to any department in order to learn more about its pro\u00ad grams of study, its requirements for graduation, and possible enrollment limitations. (Some majors, including economics, engineering, and information and computer science, are impacted-that is, more students apply than can be accom\u00ad modated-and specific conditions must be met for admission to these majors.) While advisors may not be familiar with all fields, they can suggest ways to investigate other areas of study and be helpful in planning a lower-division program which will keep several options open. Occasionally courses and workshops designed to help students make the decision are offered. All students are expected to choose a major by the beginning of the junior year. It is important to look well ahead to this decision and to think about it carefully during the freshman and sophomore years. When considering possible majors, students need to keep in mind that some major programs require quite specific preliminary study. At the same time, excessive early concentration could reduce a student's options and prevent moving to a major in a different field, without delaying the time to graduation. Furthermore, courses required for graduation need to be considered. For these rea\u00ad sons, it is desirable for students to plan their programs care\u00ad fully and thoughtfully, seeking a balance 'between exposure to a variety of academic areas and completion of courses which are prerequisite to a major under consideration. A qualified student interested in two areas of study may gradu\u00ad ate with a double major by fulfilling the degree requirements of any two programs. Once a student decides on a major, the actual procedure to formalize the decision is not complicated. A form called the Undergraduate Petition for Change of Major must be com\u00ad pleted whenever a student who has no major is ready to declare one, or whenever a student wishes to change from one major to another. The form is available from academic counselors and the Registrar's Office. Those interested in majoring in economics, engineering, or information and com\u00ad puter science should contact an academic counselor in the major for specific guidelines. UC IRVINE - 1987-198820 Majors and Careers Unaffiliated (Undeclared) Students Students who enter the University as freshmen or sopho\u00ad mores may be uncertain about which major they should choose and may not feel ready to declare their major until they have been on campus for a while. Such students partici\u00ad pate in the General Studies Advising Program (GSAP) which is administered by the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. The goal of GSAP is to help students make the best informed and most rational choice of a major that is possible. All students at UCI are expected to choose their major by the beginning of their junior year. To make a good decision about what major to declare, the student should know what prog\u00b7rams UCI offers and have some experience with them, have a good knowledge of his or her abilities and interests, have clear educational goals, and have a good sense of his or her vocational goals and of the academic programs at UCI that will provide appropriate prep\u00ad aration for them. In GSAP students receive individualized counseling that helps them explore the variety of course offerings on campus, become more aware of their own inter\u00ad ests and abilities, formulate sound educational goals, and learn how to prepare for possible careers. Preprofessional Preparation Law Law schools want to produce lawyers to serve the entire legal spectrum (for example tax, criminal, entertainment, or immi\u00ad gration law), and this requires a wide range of academic backgrounds. Law schools look less for specific areas of study than they do for evidence of excellence in any academic pro\u00ad gram. A good record in physics or classics, for example, will be preferred over a mediocre record in history or political science. The majority of law schools give equal preference to students from all academic disciplines. Courses that help develop writing and analytical skills (logic, writing, mathe\u00ad matics, research methods, and statistics courses, for example) build skills that are the key to doing well on the LSAT, suc\u00ad ceeding in law school, and entering the legal profession. UCI offers a number of law-related courses that students in any major may take. The School of Humanities offers courses in logic and the philosophy of law. The School of Social Sciences offers courses in the study of law, interna\u00ad tional relations, and economics of law and recommends that students take some political science courses as well. The Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology offers many law-related courses in both substantive law (such as environmental and criminal law) and in law and society and criminal justice and offers. its majors the opportunity to apply theories learned in the class\u00ad room to actual problems through its field study program. Students interested in applying to law school after complet\u00ad ing the baccalaureate degree should know that law schools look closely at five aspects of a student's application: grades, Law School Admissions Test (LSAT) results, the applicant's statement of purpose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and extracurricular activities and law-related work experience. Students should be aware that not everyone who applies is admitted to law school. One consideration in selecting an undergraduate major is alternative career opportunities should one's career goals change or should experience with law school result in a decision not to enter the field of law. Medicine and Other Health-Related Sciences Although leaders in health science education strongly recommend that students obtain a bachelor's degree prior to admission to the health sciences, there is no preferred major. Many students who plan to enter the health professions major in Biological Sciences because much of the basic course work for that major is the same as the preparation required for medical school admission; however, students may major in any academic field as long as they also take the courses required by professional health science schools. The min\u00ad imum amount of undergraduate preparation required by most medical and health-related schools includes the follow\u00ad ing: one year each of English, biology with laboratory, general chemistry with laboratory, organic chemistry with laboratory, physics with laboratory, and college mathematics, especially calculus and statistics. Courses in cell or molecular biology, biochemistry, genetics, developmental physiology or compar\u00ad ative anatomy, and vertebrate embryology are recommended, as is course work in computer science. In addition, some health sciences schools have certain nonscience course requirements or recommended courses in, for example, Eng\u00ad lish and/or a foreign language. Facility with the Spanish lan\u00ad guage is very helpful in California medical schools and in other areas of the United States with large Hispanic populations. Although many factors ultimately are considered when reviewing applicants for admission, admission committees look carefully at the following seven areas: college grade point average (science and nonscience grades are evaluated separately and evidence of improvement in work during the undergraduate years is important); results of the New Medi\u00ad cal College Admissions Test (MCAT), the Dental Admissions Test, and other aptitude examination scores; the student's personal essay and/or personal interview; in-depth letters of recomme\u00b7ndation; practical experience in the health sciences, whether paid or volunteer, is regarded favorably as an indica\u00ad tion of exposure to and interest in the health sciences; extra\u00ad curricular activities which demonstrate the applicant's ability to interact successfully with others; and research experience especially in a biological, medical, or behavioral science. Since medical programs cannot accommodate all qualified applicants, and competition for entrance is keen, it is impor\u00ad tant to keep in mind alternative career opportunities should one not be accepted to medical, dental, pharmacy, optometry, podiatry, or veterinary school, or should one decide to pursue instead one of the expanding number of health-related pro\u00ad grams now available. Business/Management The contemporary executive or manager must be a creative thinker, make complex decisions, and have the ability to per\u00ad ceive and participate in the full scope of an enterprise while understanding its role in the economy. Effective management requires leadership ability, strong problem-solving skills, effective oral and written communication skills, analytical skills, an understanding of economic trends, and a basic knowledge of behavioral processes in organizations. Although UCI does not offer a prebusiness program leading to an undergraduate degree, the Graduate School of Man\u00ad agement offers a minor in Management as a supplement to any undergraduate major. This minor can provide students with a broad understanding of management theory and prac\u00ad tice. In addition, it may be helpful to students in determining whether they wish to pursue a career in business or man\u00ad agement or undertake further study in management at the graduate level. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Students can also supplement their major course work to develop the skills needed for business and management by taking electives such as calculus and basic statistics, econom\u00ad ics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, psychology and sociol\u00ad ogy, computer science, and political science courses. Most graduate programs in business administration or man\u00ad agement do not require prior undergraduate course work in business. For admission purposes, graduate schools of business look at five areas: grades, scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), the applicant's statement of pur\u00ad pose, in-depth letters of recommendation, and evidence of leadership in school and community activities and work expe\u00ad rience. The latter is becoming an increasingly important pre\u00ad requisite for many programs. Career Opportunities The eight academic units at UCI which offer undergraduate education leading to the bachelor's degree provide students with a variety of opportunities to explore a wide range of interests leading to a career choice or to further education at the graduate or professional level. The lists which follow are meant to indicate to students the many and varied career areas pursued by UCI graduates, and to make students aware of some of the vast array of career choices available. Addi\u00ad tional discussions of careers are presented in individual aca\u00ad demic unit sections. Any major can lead to any number of careers. Some examples of careers frequently led to by majors available within the academic units at UCI are listed below. Biological Science Career Areas Audiology Bioanalysis Biochemistry Biomedical Engineering Cell Biology Chiropractic Medicine Dentistry Developmental Biology Dietetics Environmental Management Forestry Genetic Engineering Health Administration Industrial Hygiene Marine Biology Medical Technology Medicine Microbiology Nurse Practitioner Occupational Therapy Oceanography Optometry Osteopathy Plant Biology Pharmacology Pharmacy Physician's Assistant Physical Therapy Podiatry Prosthetics Design Public Health Quality Control Research Sales Speech Pathology Teaching Technical Writing and Editing Veterinary Medicine The health field is one of the fastest-growing career areas in the country. Work sites may include private corporations, educational institutions, hospitals, health care complexes, pri\u00ad vate foundations, city and county governments, state agen\u00ad cies, the federal government, and many others. Engineering Career Areas Aerospace Communications Computers Construction Control Systems Digital Signal Processing Electric Power Electronics Electro-optics Engines and Fuels Environmental Control Process Control Public Works Robotics Structures Transportation Water Resources Career Opportunities 21 The above is a sample of the many fields in which UCI engi\u00ad neering graduates work. Their activities typically involve them in one or more of the following: design, research and development, manufacturing or construction, operations, consulting, applications and sales, management, or teaching. At UCI they will have had the choice of civil, electrical, or mechanical engineering. However, they will frequently find challenging positions in related areas such as aerospace, bio\u00ad medical, chemical, or industrial engineering, for which their general and specialty coursework at UCI, followed by formal or informal, on-the-job training will qualify them. Approxi\u00ad mately half of UCI's engineering graduates eventually obtain advanced degrees (at UCI or elsewhere), and almost all engage in some sort of continuing education to keep abreast of advances in technology. Many engineering graduates have used their engineering background to enter graduate programs and obtain degrees in the fields of administration, law, medicine, physics, or mathematics. Fine Arts Career Areas Advertising Animation Arts Administration Art Therapy Broadcasting Choreography Commercial Art Composition Consulting Criticism Curating Direction Environmental Design Instrument Repair/Tuning Interior/Industrial Design Journalism Librarianship Lighting Marketing Medical Illustration Performance Photography Physical Fitness Printing Production Publicity Public Relations Publishing Retail Sales Set/Stage/Costume Design Teaching Tourism Writing The exceptionally talented Fine Arts graduate may choose to become a professional actor, art historian, artist, dancer, or musician. However, there are many other careers to explore in numerous arts-related areas, or the Fine Arts graduate may wish to combine part-time professional performance with supplemental work. The field of arts administration is an increasingly important career area, offering opportunities to work with opera and dance companies, repertory theatre companies, museums, state and local arts councils, commu\u00ad nity arts organizations, and arts festivals. Humanities Career Areas Advertising Banking Broadcasting Foreign Service Government Service Insurance International Relations Journalism Law Library Science Management/ Administration Marketing Personnel Public Administration Public Relations Publicity Publishing Research Retail Sales Social Welfare Teaching Technical Writing Tourism Translating/Interpreting Writing UC IRVINE - 1987-198822 Career Opportunities Diverse career fields available to Humanities graduates include entry-level positions in both the public and private sectors or professional-level opportunities combining the degree with further specialization. Humanities graduates may also elect to enter professional programs such as law, library science, or public administration. Business and indus\u00ad try utilize Humanities graduates for management training programs in banking, retail sales, and insurance. Graduates with special skills in oral and written communications may look to positions with newspapers, advertising agencies, pub\u00ad lic relations firms, radio and television stations, and publish\u00ad ing houses. Technical writers are currently in demand, particularly those who have had some preparation in engineering, computer science, and the sciences. Opportunities for graduates fluent in foreign languages exist in government, business, social service, counseling, foreign service, and international trade, among others. Information and Computer Science Career Areas Applications Programming Software Maintenance Business Applications Software Management Scientific Applications Systems Analysis Text Processing Systems Design Marketing of Computer- Systems Programming related Products Graduates of the Department of Information and Computer Science have found initial employment as programmers, software designers, systems analysts, and in sales and service of computers and software. Some graduates work for com\u00ad panies which manufacture computer hardware and/or develop computer software. Others work for organizations which use computers and computer services to solve a vari\u00ad ety of problems ranging from business data processing to the simulation of integrated circuits. Physical Science Career Areas Actuarial Science Analytical Chemistry Biochemistry Computers Electronics Engineering, Applications in Food Chemistry Forensic Chemistry Geochemistry Inorganic Chemistry Medicine Nuclear Chemistry Nuclear Reactors Optical Devices Organic Chemistry Pharmacology Physical Chemistry Physics and Applied Chemistry Psychological and Laboratory Data Quality Control Radar Radiation Chemistry Solid State Devices Statistics Teaching Graduates of the School of Physical Sciences have back grounds appropriate for a variety of areas in research and management. Career opportunities for chemists are found in federal, state, and local government as well as in private industry. Water districts, crime labs, and major chemical and oil companies are good resources for employment. Chemists may also work in research and development and in jobs deal\u00ad ing with health, pollution, energy, fuel, drugs, and plastics. Mathematics graduates find employment in both government and the private sector in such technical fields as operations research, computer programming, marketing research, actu\u00ad arial work, banking, retail management, and scientific research. Physics graduates find employment as computer programmers, laboratory technicians, systems analysts, test engineers, safety engineers, radar specialists, quality control technicians, technical writers, and high school and college teachers, as well as in research.

In the public sector, a wide variety of oppor\u00ad tunities are available in city, county, state, and federal government. Teaching is a frequently chosen career at all levels from professor to elementary school teacher. In addi\u00ad tion, many graduates enter professional practice, becoming lawyers, psychologists, researchers, or consultants of various kinds. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Placement Testing UCI administers a system of placement testing which is designed to help students assess their level of academic prep\u00ad aration for University-level course work in selected subject areas. These exams, which have been developed by Univer\u00ad sity faculty, have established test score guidelines which serve as a Criterion for course enrollment. The results of these examinations enable academic advisors and students to select the student's appropriate course of study. Placement exams are given before registration for classes and assist aca\u00ad demic advisors in helping students plan academic programs and make career choices. Students are encouraged to talk with academic counselors and advisors in order to formulate a plan of study which is best suited to their learning needs and career goals. The placement examinations are administered by the Pro\u00ad gram of Academic Support Services (PASS), a division of the Office of Undergraduate Studies. Further information may be obtained by telephoning (714) 856-6206. Detailed informa\u00ad tion about placement examinations will be sent from PASS to all newly admitted students. Placement testing is given in the areas of English as a second language, reading, chemistry, precalculus, and intermediate algebra. 1. English as a Second Language (ESL) Placement Examina\u00ad tion. This exam is required of students who are permanent residents, refugees, or international students whose first or native language is not English and who have a score on the Verbal portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) of 350 or below. 2. Sequential Test of Educational Progress (STEP) Reading Examination. Students who have a Verbal SAT score of 400 or below are urged to take this examination. 3. Chemistry/Mathematics Placement Examination. Students who wish to enroll in Chemistry 10 or Chemistry 1A are required to take this examination. In addition, students who pass the Mathematics portion of this exam become qualified for Mathematics 2A. 4. Precalculus Placement Examination. Students who wish to enroll in Mathematics 2A must first take this examination. Students who have received either a score of 600 or higher on the College Board Advanced Mathematics Achievement Test (Level Two) or a score of 3, 4, or 5 on the Mathematics Advanced Placement AB or BC Examination are exempt from taking the Precalculus Placement Examination. (Passing the mathematics portion of the Chemistry/Mathematics Place\u00ad ment Examination also enables students to enroll in Mathe\u00ad matics 2A.) 5. Intermediate Algebra Examination. Students who wish to enroll in Mathematics 1 or who have not had a prior course in trigonometry and who plan to enroll in mathematics courses at UCI are strongly encouraged to take this examination. Placement examinations will be given on the following dates: July 17 and 31, 1987 August 14, 1987 During Orientation Week, September 21-25, 1987 Universitywide Subject A Examination Effective for students entering the University in fall 1987 and thereafter, the University of California system has estab\u00ad lished the Universitywide Subject A Examination.

Please see page 48 for complete information on this new Universitywide Examination. Student Affirmative Action Student affirmative action involves the provision of equal opportunities for admission and success at the University, and specifically for increased enrollment, greater retention, and higher graduation rates of underrepresented students who are regularly admissible to the University. Educational Opportunity Program The goal of the Educational Opportunity Program (EOP) is\u00b7 to encourage representation of low-income and/or underrepre\u00ad sented students by assisting them in enrolling and succeeding at the University. The Educational Opportunity Program is designed to assist students in overcoming obstacles by provid\u00ad ing counseling on admissions and financial aid, and referral to advising, tutoring, and learning skills services. Special assist\u00ad ance on a continuing basis is available to all EOP students through the Counseling Center, the Tutorial Assistance Pro\u00ad gram , Learning Skills Services, and the Special Services Office. Additional information and personal admissions coun\u00ad seling may be obtained from the EOP/SAA staff by telephon\u00ad ing (714) 856-5410. Students from low-income and/or underrepresented groups are encouraged to apply. EOP assists those who are regularly admissible to the University, and also those who may not have met all of the regular admissions requirements but who can offer evidence supporting their ability to achieve at the University level. With the exception of American Indians, only residents of the State of California are eligible to apply for EOP sponsorship. American Indian applicants must document their tribal affiliation. UC IRVINE - 1987-198824 Student Affirmative Action/Expenses and Fees Admission Prospective students interested in EOP must complete the regular UC admission forms and follow all procedures. Appli\u00ad cants should take particular care with the required essay and indicate their interest in EOP by marking the appropriate places provided on the application. Applications may be obtained from counseling offices in California high schools and community colleges, the UCI Office of Admissions, or the EOP/SAA-Outreach Office. Applicants who require spe\u00ad cial admissions consideration are advised to submit two let\u00ad ters of recommendation from teachers, counselors, persons in the community, or employers, which document the stu\u00ad dent's background, motivation, and academic potential. Financial Assistance Personal financial resources should not be the determining factor in deciding whether or not to attend college. All stu\u00ad dents admitted to UCI, including EOP students, are eligible for financial assistance on the basis of demonstrated need. Funds can be provided to cover room and board, fees, books and supplies, and living expenses, when a student or family is unable to fully meet these expenses. Financial aid is com\u00ad prised of a combination or \"package\" of grant, loan, scholar\u00ad ship, and/or part-time employment based on the individual circumstances of the applicant. See Financial Aid, page 29. Undergraduate Student Affirmative Action ()utreachProgram The purpose of the Student Affirmative Action Outreach Program is to attract underrepresented minority students who are regularly admissible to UCI. Campus representatives visit high schools, community colleges, and community cen\u00ad ters to meet with students, parents, teachers, and school offi\u00ad cials to discuss educational opportunities at UCI. The pro\u00ad gram also includes a series of seminars and workshops aimed at orienting students to specific academic disciplines, particu\u00ad larly mathematics, physics, computer science, chemistry, biol\u00ad ogy, and engineering where minorities historically have been underrepresented. Early C>utreach Partnership Program Young students are the focus of two partnership programs: Partnership Junior High and Partnership Senior High. Both programs are designed to ensure that more students from underrepresented groups become eligible for admission to the University. Students, parents, and teachers are provided information and skills development sessions and are advised about appropriate University preparatory course work. Addi\u00ad tional information about these programs is available by tele\u00ad phoning (714) 856-7482. Academic Enrichment Program Open to selected outstanding high school students from underrepresented groups, the Academic Enrichment Program stresses academic preparation in the areas of writing, human\u00ad ities, fine arts, computer science, and mathematics. Students participate in seminars, field trips, and discussion groups both on the Irvine campus and at their high schools. Additional information is available by telephoning (714) 856-6362. Summer Pre-Entry Program for Medical Students This program is designed to introduce newly accepted minor\u00ad ity and/or disadvantaged medical students to the type and volume of study materials they will encounter during their medical education. Additional information is available in the College of Medicine section. Summer Premedical Program This program seeks to increase the number of minority and/or disadvantaged students who are accepted into medical school by providing participants with the special skills and prerequisites needed to obtain an M.D. degree. Additional information is available in the College of Medicine section. Special Services The Office of Special Services provides students from educa\u00ad tionally and economically disadvantaged backgrounds, dis\u00ad abled students, and underrepresented students with support services to help them succeed and earn their University degree. A primary responsibility of Special Services is to monitor the academic progress of their students. In order to best assist students who are having difficulty with their course work, professional and peer counselors maintain a close liaison with academic departments. When needed, counseling and refer\u00ad rals to other campus support services are provided. In con\u00ad junction with these academic and service units, the Engineer\u00ad ing and Computer Science Educational Laboratory (ECSEL) program and a variety of workshops are offered throughout the year by Special Services. Special Services also sponsors and conducts the Summer Educational Opportunity Program (SEOP) for underprepared students who demonstrate the potential to succeed at the University. The SEOP is designed to provide and refine basic academic skills necessary for students to successfully com\u00ad plete their course work during the regular school year. Students are encouraged to make appointments with the Office of Special Services and may do so by telephoning (714) 856-6234. Graduate and Professional C>pportunity Program Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the participation of minorities, and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the Uni\u00ad versity. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admis\u00ad sion process, and every effort is made through GPOP advis\u00ad ing and support to ensure that all students will have a rea\u00ad sonable chance to attain their academic objectives. Expenses and Fees Estimated Expenses NOTE: Undergraduate and graduate estimated figures are based on three quarters of attendance. Figures for first-year medical students are based on 10 months of attendance and are higher for second-through fourth-year students, who attend for a calendar year. All fees are subject to change without notice, and the University may impose additional fees. The following is intended only as a guide in computing average expenses. Fee payment dates are announced in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Special Expenditures Special expenditures beyond the cost of books and basic sup\u00ad plies may be associated with certain courses of study. For example, field study assignments may involve transportation expenses; students who take a dance class may be required to wear a certain type of shoe; a student may need a calculator. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Fees Under terms of the Alan Pattee Scholarship Act a surviving child of a California resident who died as a result of accident or injury incurred in the performance of active law enforce\u00ad ment or active fire suppression and prevention duties is eligi\u00ad ble to apply for waiver of certain fees. Additional information concerning this Act is available from the Registrar's Office. Registration Fee The University Registration Fee is $178 per quarter. The full fee is required of all students regardless of the number of courses taken. This fee, which must be paid at the time of registration, is a charge to each student for services which benefit the student and which are complementary to, but not a part of, the instructional programs. No part of this fee is remitted to students who may not desire to make use of all or any of these services. Graduate students studying out of the State may be eligible to pay one-half of the Registration Fee. The $50 advance deposit on the Registration Fee (Under\u00ad graduate Acceptance of Admission Fee), required of new undergraduates, is applied to the full fee when the student registers. Continuing students are required to pay all out\u00ad standing fines and other debts, in full, before they pay their Registration Fee for an upcoming term. Medical students are required to pay the full Registration Fee for each fall, winter, and spring quarter, and a reduced Regis\u00ad tration Fee for each summer quarter. As of spring 1987, the fee for summer quarter, 1987 is $80. California Residents Expenses and Fees 25 Educational Fee The Educational Fee for undergraduate students is $268 per quarter for all full-time undergraduate and graduate students. Medical students are required to pay the Educational Fee for each quarter in which they enroll, including the summer quarter. Part-Time Status Undergraduate and graduate students on approved part-time status (enrollment in 10 units or less per quarter for under\u00ad graduates am! in eight units or less per quarter for graduate students, including physical education units) pay the full Uni\u00ad versity Registration Fee and one-half the Educational Fee paid by students on full-time status. Those part-time stu\u00ad dents who have been determined to be nonresidents of the State of California are assessed one-half the Nonresident Tuition, in addition to the Registration and Educational Fees. Students seeking part-time status must obtain the approval of the appropriate academic dean, and part-time status can be granted cinly for reasons of financial need, health, or family responsibilities. Part-time status lapses at the end of each academic year. A student must, therefore, reapply each year that part-time status is desired. Associated Students Fees The Associated Students Fee is $13 per quarter for under\u00ad graduates and $9 per quarter for graduate and medical stu\u00ad dents.

Nonresident Tuition Fee and California Residence Students who have not been residents of California for more than one year immediately prior to the residence determina\u00ad tion date are charged, along with other fees, a Nonresident Tuition Fee of $1,430 for each quarter or $4,290 per year for each year of attendance required by the curriculum, whether such year extends over three or four academic quarters. The residence determination date is the day instruction begins at the last of the University of California campuses to open for the quarter, and for schools on the semester system, the day instruction begins for the semester. Nonresident undergrad\u00ad uate and graduate students on approved part-time status shall pay one-half the Nonresident Tuition. Inquiries from prospective students regarding residence requirements for tuition purposes should be directed to the Residence Deputy in the Registrar's Office. No other Univer\u00ad sity personnel are authorized to supply information relative to residence requirements for tuition purposes. Any student, following a final decision on residence classification by the Residence Deputy, may make written appeal to the Legal Analyst Residence Matters (590 University Hall, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720) within 90 days after notification of the final decision by the Residence Deputy. General In order to be classified as a resident for tuition purposes upon admission, an adult student, except an adult alien pre\u00ad sent in the United States under the terms of a nonimmigrant status which precludes the adult alien from establishing dom\u00ad icile in the U.S., must have established his or her residence in California for more than one year immediately preceding the residence determination date for the term for which the stu\u00ad dent proposes to attend the University and must relinquish any prior residence. An adult student must couple his or her physical presence within the State of California for one year with objective evidence that such presence is consistent with the student's intent in making California his or her per\u00ad manent horne and, if these steps are delayed, the one-year dura tiona! period will be extended until BOTH presence and intent have been demonstrated for one full year. Physical presence within the State solely for educational purposes UC IRVINE - 1987-1988California Residence 27 Student-operated campus radio station KUCI (88.9 FMI provides a variety of entertainment for listeners, from classical to new wave music, talk shows, and special programming. does not constitute the establishment of California residence under State law regardless of the length of the student's stay in California. Relevant indicia which can be relied upon to demonstrate one's intent to make California his or her permanent resi\u00ad dence include, but are not limited to, the following: register\u00ad ing and voting in California elections; designating California as the student's permanent address on all school and employment records, including military records if one is in the military service; obtaining a California driver's license or, if a nondriver, a California Identification Card; obtaining California vehicle registration; paying California income taxes as a resident, including income earned outside the State; establishing an abode where one's permanent belong\u00ad ings are kept within California; licensing for professional practice in California; and the absence of these indicia in other places during any period for which residence in Cali\u00ad fornia is asserted. Documentary evidence may be required. No single factor is controlling or decisive. All relevant indicia will be considered in the classification determination. The residence of the parent with whom an unmarried minor (under age 18) child maintains his or her place of abode is the residence of the unmarried minor child. When the minor lives with neither parent, his or her residence is that of the parent with whom he or she maintained his or her last place of abode, provided the minor, except a minor alien in the United States under the terms of a nonimmigrant status which precludes the minor alien from establishing domicile in the U.S., may establish his or her residence when both par\u00ad ents are deceased and a legal guardian has not been appointed. The residence of an unmarried minor who has a parent living cannot be changed by his or her own act, by the appointment of a legal guardian, or by relinquishment of a parent's right of control. A man or a woman establishes his or her residence. A wife's residence shall not be derivative from that of her husband, or vice versa. Procedures New and returning students are required to complete a Statement of Legal Residence. The student's status is deter\u00ad mined by the Residence Deputy who is located in the Regis\u00ad trar's Office. All students classified incorrectly as residents are subject to nonresident status and to payment of all nonresident fees not paid. If incorrect classification results from false or concealed facts by the student, the student is subject to University dis\u00ad cipline. Resident students who become nonresidents must immediately notify the Residence Deputy. Exceptions I. A student who is a U.S. citizen or eligible alien who remains in this State after his or her pa~;ent, who was a Cali\u00ad fornia resident for at least one year immediately prior to leaving and has, during the student's minority and within one year immediately prior to the residence determination date, established residence elsewhere, shall be entitled to resident classification. This classification will continue until the stu\u00ad dent has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident so long as, once enrolled, he or she maintains continuous attendance at an institution. 2. A student who is a U.S. citizen or eligible alien who is a minor or 18 years of age and can give evidence that he or she has been totally self-supporting through employment and actually present within California for the entire year imme\u00ad diately prior to the residence determination date and has evi\u00ad denced the intent to make California the permanent home may be eligible for resident status. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988-28 California Residence 3. A student who is a U.S. citizen or eligible alien shall be entitled to resident classification if immediately prior to the residence determination date he or she has lived with and been under the continuous direct care and control of any adult or adults other than a parent for not less than two years, provided that the adult or adults having such control have been California residents during the year immediately prior to the residence determination date. This exception continues until the student has attained the age of majority and has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident, so long as continuous attendance is main\u00ad tained at an institution. 4. Exemption from payment of the Nonresident Tuition Fee is available to the natural or adopted child, stepchild, or spouse who is a dependent of a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty. Such exemp\u00ad tion may be maintained until the student has resided in Cali\u00ad fornia the minimum time necessary to become a resident. If a student is enrolled in an institution and the member of the military (a) is transferred on military orders to a place outside the state where the member continues to serve in the armed forces of the United States, or (b) is retired as an active member of the armed forces immediately after having been on active duty in California, the student is entitled to retain the exemption under conditions set forth above. 5. A student who is a member of the United States military stationed in California on active duty, except a member of the military assigned for educational purposes to a State\u00ad supported institution of higher education, shall be entitled to resident classification until he or she has resided in the State the minimum time necessary to become a resident. 6. Children of deceased public law enforcement or fire sup\u00ad pression employees, who were California residents and who were killed in the course of law enforcement or fire suppres\u00ad sion duties, may be entitled to resident status. 7. To the extent funds are available, the unmarried, depen\u00ad dent child under age 21 or the spouse of a member of the University faculty who is a member of the Academic Senate may be eligible for a waiver of the nonresident tuition. 8. A student who is the dependent child or spouse of a full\u00ad time employee of the University of California who is assigned to work outside of California may be entitled to resident classification. Reclassification Beginning fall1985, the University of California reclassifica\u00ad tion regulations were amended as indicated b':low: In determining a student's eligibility for reclassification, financial independence is included among the factors con\u00ad sidered in evaluating intent to establish residence in Califor\u00ad nia. The California Legislature has defined as financially independent those students who meet the following criteria for the current and three immediately preceding calendar years: That the student has not been claimed as an exemption for state and federal income tax purposes by his or her parents; That the student has not received more than $750 from his or her parents; and That the student has not lived in the home of his or her parents for more than six weeks in any given year. Students whose parents have been California residents for at least one year immediately prior to the residence determina-tion date are not subject to the financial independence factor when applying for reclassification. Financial independence will not be included as a factor for graduate student teaching assistants, research assistants, and teaching associates who are employed on a 0.49 or more time basis for the term for which reclassification is sought. In determining whether a student has objectively manifested intent to establish California residence, financial indepen\u00ad dence shall weigh in favor of finding California residence for reclassification purposes, and financial dependence shall weigh against finding California residence for reclassification purposes. Financial dependence in the current and preceding calendar year shall weigh more heavily against finding California resi\u00ad dence for reclassification purposes than shall financial dependence in earlier calendar years. A student who is financially dependent in the current and preceding calendar year shall be found to be a California resi\u00ad dent for reclassification purposes only if no factors exist which evidence the student's continuing residence in another state. Time Limitation on Providing Documentation. If addi\u00ad tional documentation is required for either an initial residence classification or a reclassification but is not readily accessible, the student will be allowed a period of time no later than the end of the applicable term to provide such documentation. Inquiries and Appeals The student is cautioned that this summation is not a com\u00ad plete explanation of the law regarding residence. The student should also note that changes may have been made in the rate of nonresident tuition and the residence requirements between the time this catalogue statement is published and the relevant residence determination date. Regulations have been adopted by The Regents, and a copy is available for inspection in the Registrar's Office. Fee Refunds Registration Fees New undergraduates who cancel their registration before the first day of instruction are entitled to a refund of Registra\u00ad tion Fee paid except for the nonrefundable Statement of Intent to Register Fee. This fee is $50 for students entering during either winter or spring quarter 1988 and $100 for students entering during subsequent quarters. The Asso\u00ad ciated Student Fee, the University Center Fee, and the Bren Events Center fee are refunded only for cancellation of regis\u00ad tration prior to the first day of orientation. Other fees paid are refunded in full. For all continuing and readmitted students, and new graduate and medical students, there is a service charge of $10 for can\u00ad cellation of registration prior to the first day of instruction. Students who withdraw from the University during the first five weeks of instruction1 will receive refunds of Registration Fee, Educational Fee, and Nonresident Tuition Fee (less the $50 nonrefundable Undergraduate Acceptance of Admission Fee) based on the effective date of withdrawal: 1-14 calendar days, 80% of amount paid; 15-21 60% of 22-28 calendar days, 40% of amount paid; 29-35 IJf no credit for courses is received, a full refund of the Registration Fee of the regular session will be granted to all students entering the armed forces prior to the sixth week of the quarter. No refund thereafter. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988calendar days, 20% of amount paid; 36 calendar days and over, 0%. The effective date of withdrawal is normally the date the student's official notice of withdrawal is received by the University. However, under extenuating circumstances, the Ombudsman, the Dean of Graduate Studies, or the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs, as appropriate, may determine that the effective date of withdrawal occurred prior to the filing of the notice. It is pre\u00ad sumed that no University services will be provided to the student after that date. Claims for refund of fees must be presented during the fiscal year (July I to June 30) in which the claim is applicable. To obtain a refund, the student must surrender the identifica\u00ad tion card to the Ombudsman, the Dean of Graduate Studies, or the College of Medicine Associate Dean for Medical Stu\u00ad dent Affairs at the time of withdrawal. Refund checks are issued by the Accounting Office and are received by mail generally four to six weeks after the official notice of with\u00ad drawal is processed. If any portion of a student's fees has been paid by the Uni\u00ad versity or outside sources, that portion of the refund will be returned directly to the source of those funds. Students who are receiving financial aid and withdraw from UCI during a quarter will have to repay a portion of their aid based on the same schedule as UCI's refund policy. Housing Refunds UCI Housing Contracts provide students with complete housing refund policies. Financial Aid Lack of funds need not be a barrier to attending UCI; almost one half of enrolled students receive some form of financial aid. Students who demonstrate that they need financial assistance in order to attend are eligible for financial aid through the Financial Aid Office. In addition to awarding aid on the basis of financial need, the Office also offers some scholarships based on academic excellence. Students who receive financial aid may receive funds from one or more of the following sources: scholarships, grants, loans, and work-study. These sources are described briefly in the following sections; more detailed information can be obtained from the Financial Aid Office. To obtain financial aid, new and continuing students must file the Student Aid Application for California (SAAC) and the necessary supporting documents each year. Students are encouraged to apply as early as possible. The SAAC is avail\u00ad able at high schools, local colleges and universities, and at the UCI Financial Aid Office. Forms, information regarding the application process, deadlines, and financial aid programs for undergraduate, graduate, and medical students may be found in the Financial Aid Application Packet which is available in the Financial Aid Office. The priority deadline for loans, work-study, and most grants is around March 2. The Univer\u00ad sity expects the student and the parent (or spouse) to con\u00ad tribute toward the educational costs to every extent possible. For dependent students, an analysis of the SAAC and sup\u00ad porting documents determines the amount a student and the student's parents can be expected to contribute toward the cost of the student's education. For independent students, the analysis determines the amount a student and/or spouse can contribute to the cost of the student's education. Income, assets, size of family, and the number of family members in college are the major factors considered in the analysis. Assets include, but are not limited to, equity in real estate; stocks, bonds, and other securities; business and farm equity; Fee Refunds/Financial Aid 29 and cash, savings, and checking accounts. Income includes wages, salaries, interest, dividends, and nontaxable income such as Social Security and Veterans' benefits. All undergraduate financial aid applicants also are required to apply for a Pell Grant, and in addition eligible California resi\u00ad dents are required to apply for a Cal Grant A or a Cal Grant B. The application deadline for Cal Grants A and B is March 2 for the following academic year. Special Expenditures Financial aid recipients who are in need of money for special expenditures (beyond the cost of books and basic supplies associated with certain courses of study) may make an appointment to see a financial aid counselor to explore the possibility of a budget extension, based on the availability of funds. Examples of such special expenditures include trans\u00ad portation costs for a field study assignment, special shoes for a dance class, or special equipment for handicapped students. UCI Policy on Satisfactory Academic Progress for Financial Aid Undergraduate and Graduate Students In defining student eligibility for financial aid, the Higher Education Act of 1980 states that a student must maintain \"satisfactory progress in the course of study the student is pursuing, according to the standards and practices of the institution at which the student is in attendance.\" Federal regulations of May 1982 further state that each institution shall establish, publish, and apply \"reasonable standards\" for assuring that every student receiving need-based financial aid should maintain \"satisfactory progress in his/her course of study.\" Final Federal regulations, published October 6, 1983, further state that \"in order to receive student financial aid under the programs authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act, a student must be maintaining satisfactory progress in the course of study he or she is pursuing accord\u00ad ing to the standards and practices of the institution in which he or she is enrolled.\" The following requirements for satisfactory academic pro\u00ad gress for receipt of financial aid apply to all applicants for any financial aid awards administered by the UCI Financial Aid Office. These requirements are separate and distinct from UCI's policy regarding satisfactory academic progress. I. Grade Point Average (GPA) All financial aid recipients must comply with the following minimum cumulative grade point average requirement. Undergraduate students Year 1: 1.85; Year 2: 1.90; Year 3: 1.95; Year 4: - 1987-198830 Financial Aid 2.

NOTE: Students who enroll in more than the minimum number of units required per quarter in the first and second years will have the additional units carried forward for the cumulative total. 3. Quarter Limits for Eligibility All financial aid applicants exceeding the following quarter limits will be ineligible for financial aid consideration. Undergraduate students: I. Entering freshmen are eligible for all types of financial aid for a total of IS quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to deter\u00ad mine the number of remaining quarters of financial aid eligi\u00ad bility at UCI. 3. Students acquiring a second bachelor's degree will have six quarters of additional financial aid eligibility for a maximum of 2I quarters of undergraduate attendance. Graduate students: I. Limited Status (California educational credential) students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 2. Limited Status (noncredential) students: four quarters of academic year attendance. 3. Master's degree designed for completion in: a. three quarters: five quarters of academic year attendance. b. six quarters: eight quarters of academic year attendance. c. nine quarters: eleven quarters of academic year attendance. 4. Ph.D. students will be eligible for 21 quarters of need\u00ad based financial aid following the completion of their baccalau\u00ad reate degree. Note: Students will not be granted additional quarters of elig\u00ad ibility solely by reason of changing their field of study or pur\u00ad suing more than one major. Medical Students: I. Incoming students in their first year of attendance will be eligible to apply for financial assistance for a total of I8 quin\u00ad tiles of attendance. The time constraint for completion of this limitation is as follows: Regular curriculum ........................... four be completed in the first three years. Quintiles 9-I8 must be completed in the remaining two years. 2. Advanced standing transfer students will have transcripts from previous postsecondary institutions evaluated to deter\u00ad mine remaining quintiles of financial aid eligibility. Unit Evaluation I. Remedial courses Required remedial courses will count toward the undergrad\u00ad uate, graduate, and medical student minimum unit/clock\u00ad hour requirement of the satisfactory academic progress pol\u00ad icy for financial aid. 2. Grade evaluation As defined below, units for the following grades will not be counted toward meeting the minimum unit/clock-hour requirement. Undergraduate and graduate students F Failure I Incomplete NP Not Pass U Unsatisfactory W Withdraw NR No grade reported Repeat courses Repeat of a D grade or higher repeat of advanced standing or high school course. Medical students F Failure NR No grade reported Repeat courses Repeat of a D grade or higher 3. Incomplete courses Medical School Clock-hours for a grade of Incomplete (I) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress for the quintile during which the student took the course. If the student fails to meet the requirements for removing the I and the I becomes a grade of F, the clock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic pro\u00ad gress record. 4. Courses in progress Medical School Clock-hours for courses in In Progress (IP) will be counted toward satisfactory academic progress during the first quin\u00ad tile of a course requiring two quintiles for completion. Stu\u00ad dents in the Primary Care Clerkship will have the IP count toward the clock-hour requirement for four quintiles. Should the student fail to receive a passing grade, after the course has been completed the dock-hours for that course will be deleted retroactively from the student's satisfactory academic progress record. Satisfactory Academic Progress Deficiencies and Their Effect on Receiving Financial Aid. The requirements for undergraduate and graduate student satisfactory academic progress stated above are monitored each quarter and at the end of the academic year. Students who fail to maintain satisfactory academic progress will have their financial aid eligibility affected in the following manner. UC IRVINE - 1987-19881. Quarterly totals Units and grade point average The Financial Aid Office will monitor the totals for units and grade point average after the conclusion of each quarter. a. Agrade point average total below 2.0 (undergraduate) or 3.0 (graduate student) must be increased to 2.0 or 3.0, whichever applies, by the conclusion of spring quarter or summer session. b. Unit total below 12 per quarter The student will be placed on satisfactory academic proba\u00ad tion. The student will receive financial aid funds for the academic year. The deficiency must be cleared by the con\u00ad Clusion of spring quarter or summer session. c. Unit total below 6 per quarter The student will be disqualified for financial aid funds and will be billed for all monies received in that quarter. The bill will be due and payable at once. The student will be barred from registration until all canceled financial aid funds have been repaid. 2. Academic year totals units and grade point average The Financial Aid Office will verify the cumulative totals for units and grade point average after the conclusion of spring quarter. Students who have unit or grade point average defi\u00ad ciencies will be required to make up the deficiency prior to receiving any financial aid funds, including funds that would also be used for payment of fees. 3. At the completion of each academic year students will be notified if they have exceeded their quarter limits for eligibility. Quarterly Unit Deficiency and Its Effect on Peii Grant and Cal Grant A and 8 1. Pell Grant Students receiving a Pell Grant must be enrolled in a min\u00ad imum of 12 units each quarter. The Financial Aid Office will verify unit totals for all Pell Grant recipients at the conclu\u00ad sion of each quarter. The Pell Grant unit requirement does not provide a probationary period in which the student\u00b7may make up the deficiency. Students who are enrolled for less than 12 units at the conclusion of the quarter will have their Pell Grant award reduced as follows: 11.9-9.0 units will receive three-fourths of the Pell Grant 8.9-6.0 units will receive one-half of the Pell Grant 5.9-0.0 units will have their Pell Grant canceled If the Pell Grant reduction is made due to a deficiency in the fall quarter, the spring quarter Pell Grant award will be reduced. If the Pell Grant reduction is made due to a defi\u00ad ciency in the winter or spring quarter, the student will be billed, approximately three weeks after the conclusion of the quarter, for the amount of the reduction. 2. Cal Grant A and B Students receiving Cal Grant A orB must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 units each quarter. The Financial Aid Office will verify unit totals for all Cal Grant A recipients at the conclusion of each quarter, and for all Cal Grant B recipients at the conclusion of each month. The Cal Grant unit requirement does not provide a probationary period in which a student may make up the deficiency. Cal Grant recipients who are enrolled for less than 12 units will have their Cal Grant awards reduced as follows: 11.9-9.0 units will receive three-fourths of the Cal Grant 8.9-6.0 units will receive orie-half of the Cal Grant 5.9-0.0 units will have their Cal Grant canceled Satisfactory Academic Progress Appeals After failure to maintain satisfactory academic progress, a Financial Aid/Scholarships 31 student will be considered for financial aid only when one of the following conditions has been met: a. Sufficient units have been completed and/or the minimum cumulative grade point average requirement has been satisfied. b. It is ~stablished through the financial aid appeals process that the student encountered some type of extenuating cir\u00ad cumstances during the quarter(s) iri question which hindered academic performance (i.e., prolonged hospitalization, death in the family). Appeals Procedure Students wishing to appeal must submit the UCI Financial Aid Appeals Request Form and a letter to the Financial Aid Office stating their reasons for failing to m~et the unit or grade point average requirements, and whether or not they have solved their difficulties. The Ombudsman's assistance may be sought in the preparation of appeals. Undergraduate students also may be required to submit a degree check,\u00b7 course plan, or letter from their dean. All relevant material will be presented to the Financial Aid Appeals Board (the Board is composed of Financial Aid professional staff). Once the material has been reviewed, the Board will decide whether or not the student's eligibility for aid will be rein\u00ad stated. In the event the Board decides not to accept the stu\u00ad dent's appeal, the student will be given the right to a personal interview with the Board. If the student decides to exercise this right, a final recommendation based upon the interview and written material will.be made by the Board and for\u00ad warded to the Director of Financial Aid for a firial decision. For graduate students, the appeal is reviewed by (i) the Graduate Advisor of the student's advanced program and (2) the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, who will make the final recommendations to the Director of Financial Aid for a final decision. Scholarships Scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic ability, achievement, and promise. They do not require repayment. Although a few honorary scholarships are awarded on the basis of academic excellence alone, many also require that an applicant demonstrate financial need. Filing deadlines vary each year, but the usual deadline is mid-January for the fol\u00ad lowing academic year. Students with proven high academic achievement are invited to apply for five top awards: the . Regents', University, Chancellor's Club, Alumni Association, or UCI Foundation Scholarships. Regents' scholarships, among the highest honors conferred upon UC students, are awarded on the basis of academic excellence and exceptional promise, without reference to financial need. Undergraduate students. are eligible upon grad\u00ad uation from high school or upon completion of the sopho\u00ad more year of college. Medical students are eligible during any year of their study in medical school. The appointments range from four years for students entering from high school and first-year medical students, to two years for undergradu\u00ad ate students appointed after their sophomore year. Regents' Scholars receive a $500 honorarium for each year of their appointment. In addition, a stipend is awarded each year to Regents' Scholars who submit a complete financial aid appli\u00ad cation and demonstrate financial need. University scholarships are offered to students entering their freshman or junior year who show evidence of high scholas\u00ad tic attainment. Students who demonstrate financial need may UC IRVINE - 1987-198832 Grants/Loans receive stipends ranging up to $1,200 per academic year. These stipends may be renewed by submitting an application for consideration each year. UCI sponsors nine National Merit Scholarships.

These federal grants range from $100 to $4,000 per year, depending upon financial need. UC Grant-In-Aid (GIA) is funded by the University of Cali\u00ad fornia and provides grant aid for full-time students who demonstrate financial need. The amount awarded depends upon financial need. Loans Loans are often part of a financial aid award. They provide recipients with an opportunity to defer the cost of their edu\u00ad cation by borrowing when needed and paying later. How\u00ad ever, loan recipients must pay interest on the amount bor\u00ad rowed; interest rates vary from 5 to 12 percent per year. The deferment and cancellation provisions for the loans listed below are contained on the promissory note each recipient must sign and also may be obtained from the Financial Aid Office or lender. A student's loan responsibilities, prior to acceptance of the loan, are to understand the terms of the loan and participate in an entrance interview. After accepting the loan, the recip\u00ad ient must repay the loan in accordance with the repayment schedule, advise the UCI Financial Services Office (101 Administration Building) upon leaving UCI; participate in an exit interview; and provide the Office with a current address after leaving UCI. In case of death or total disability, out\u00ad standing loan obligations may be canceled upon presentation of official confirming documents. Perkins Loan (formerly National Direct Student Loan) pro\u00ad vides long-term federal loans for U.S. citizens and eligible noncitizens. The amounts awarded vary, depending on finan\u00ad cial need, but cannot exceed $4,500 for the first two years or $9,000 for the undergraduate years. No interest is charged nor is repayment required while the borrower is enrolled in at least one half of the normal academic load. Interest of five percent a year begins nine months after the borrower ceases to be enrolled or is enrolled less than half time, and repay\u00ad ment must be completed within a 10-year period. Graduate students may receive an aggregate of $18,000 which includes loans received as an undergraduate.

The maximum amount for an academic year is $3,000. The five percent interest accrues from the beginning of the repayment period. Repayment begins six months after the student ceases to be enrolled full time and must be completed within five years. Two cosigners are required. Guaranteed Student Loan (GSL) requires both a SAAC and a separate state application (contact the Financial Aid Office for application forms). This loan is available to undergraduate, graduate, and medical students who are U.S. citizens or per\u00ad manent residents. Freshmen and sophmores may borrow up to $2,625 annually; juniors and seniors may borrow $4,000 annually; graduate and medical students may borrow $7,500 annually. Undergraduates may not exceed a cumulative total of $17,250; graduate and medical students may not exceed a cumulative total of $54,750. Interest of eight percent per year begins to accrue six months after graduation, with\u00ad drawal, or less than half-time enrollment. Students who had a Guaranteed Student Loan prior to the 1981-82 academic year may continue to borrow at seven percent using a nine\u00ad month grace period. A minimum repayment of $50 per month begins after the student ceases to be enrolled at least half time. The entire loan must be repaid in 15 years. Both a Guarantee and Origination Fee will be deducted by the lender from the loan amount. These loans are made by banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions. If the student's lending institution does not participate in this program, the Financial Aid Office can provide a list of participating lenders and their requirements and/or restrictions. California Loans to Assist Students (CLAS) require a separ\u00ad ate application which is available at the Financial Aid Office. This loan program is designed to assist parents of dependent undergraduate students who are unable to demonstrate need for campus-based aid or a guaranteed student loan. An eligi\u00ad ble parent may borrow up to $3,000 each academic year on behalf of each qualified undergraduate. The loan amount may not exceed the net cost of education during the year. Repayment of principal and interest of 12 percent begins 60 days after disbursement of the loan. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988An independent student may borrow up to $4,000 each aca\u00ad demic year, minus any amount obtained under the Guaran\u00ad teed Student Loan Program. Students who continue to remain enrolled full-time will immediately enter into student deferment status, and the repayment period for these stu\u00ad dents begins immediately when they drop below full-time enrollment, withdraw, or graduate. The student borrower remains responsible for payment of interest during this defer\u00ad ment period. Generally the borrower is allowed at least five years but not more than 10 years to repay the loan. Health Education Assistance Loan (HEAL) provides educa\u00ad tional loans to medical students. Applicants must be U.S. citi\u00ad zens or permanent residents who are enrolled in or have been accepted for enrollment to the College of Medicine.

Loan repayment begins after a student has completed professional training, including internships and residencies, and must be completed within 10 years. Emergency loans are made from an emergency student loan fund made possible through various philanthropic individuals and organizations. Undergraduate and graduate students who have experienced unanticipated financial problems of a temporary nature may borrow up to $100 without interest or service charge. Medical students may borrow up to $300. During fall quarter only, students may have an emergency loan processed for the amount of their fees. Emergency loans must be repaid within 30 days after disbursement or by the end of the academic quarter, whichever occurs first. Applica\u00ad tions are available in the Financial Aid Office or at the Medi\u00ad cal School Financial Aid Office. This loan is not based on demonstrated financial need. Work-Study The work-study program offers eligible students who dem\u00ad onstrate need an opportunity to pay for their living and edu\u00ad cational expenses as they occur. It also helps them to avoid a large debt that will have to be repaid after leaving school. Both undergraduate and graduate students are eligible for work-study awards. Medical students must obtain the ap\u00ad proval of the Associate Dean for Medical Student Affairs prior to obtaining work-study employment. Students awarded work-study have the choice of obtaining a work\u00ad study job either on campus or off campus at a nonprofit agency. A variety of work opportunities are available, and such part-time work experience can be a valuable asset when seeking employment after graduation. Information about the terms and conditions of work-study employment will be pro\u00ad vided in the UCI Financial Aid Award Guide sent to all UCI students receiving financial aid. Veterans Work-Study Program is available only to U.S. mil\u00ad itary veterans. Separate applications and detailed information are available from the UCI Veterans Student Services Office.

The finan\u00ad cial change must be fully documented. These students must complete at least three years of study at UCI as undergradu\u00ad ates of four years of study at UCI as graduate students in order to be considered for assistance. Priority will be given to students who will be receiving their degrees during the cur\u00ad rent academic year. Financial aid is limited to the expenses for books and fees. Aid for Disabled Students All forms of student financial aid are available to eligible dis\u00ad abled students. Interested students should follow the regular financial aid application procedures and should be sure to specify on the Student Aid Application for California any additional expenses they may incur because of a disability. Supporting documentation must be provided. Student Employment The Career Planning and Placement Center assists UCI stu\u00ad dents and their spouses in obtaining part-or full-time employment during the academic year and summer vacation. It is not necessary to be a financial aid recipient to apply for jobs through the Center. Students with work-study awards also may obtain on-campus or off-campus job referrals in the Career Planning and Placement Center. The Center is located in Student Services I. UC IRVINE - 1987-198834 Undergraduate Admissions/Freshman Standing Undergraduate Admissions The Office of Admissions welcomes inquiries on any aspect of becoming eligible for the University of California and on planning for transfer. Admissions counselors are available by appointment in 245 Administration Building, and inquiries may be addressed to the Office of Admissions, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717. General informa\u00ad tion on application filing is available by telephoning (714) 856-6703. The information on admission to UCI given below is organ\u00ad ized as follows: Categories of Application Admission Requirements Admission as a Freshman Applicant Admission as a Transfer Applicant Nonresident Admission Requirements Admission of International Students Application Procedures Additional Information Categories of Application An undergraduate applicant is a student who wishes to com\u00ad plete a program of studies leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Music, or Bachelor of Science degree. A freshman applicant is a student who has graduated from high school or has completed a California Certificate of Profi\u00ad ciency, an equivalent proficiency examination from another state, or the General Educational Development (GED) Certifi\u00ad cate, but has not enrolled in a regular session' of any collegiate-level institution. Summer sessions immediately fol\u00ad lowing graduation are excluded in the determination of freshman status. A transfer applicant is a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in a regular or extension session of a college or university other than a summer session immediately following high school graduation. An intercampus transfer applicant is an undergraduate stu\u00ad dent who is currently or was previously registered in a regu\u00ad lar session at another campus of the University of California and has not been registered in another collegiate institution. See page 55. A nonresident applicant is a student whose legal permanent residence (as determined by the University) is outside of the State of California. Nonresident applicants are generally required to pay Nonresident Tuition and must also present a higher grade point average than is required of California res\u00ad idents. Refer to the Nonresident Admission Requirements section for further information. An applicant for readmission is a student who was formerly registered and enrolled on the Irvine campus and who has interrupted the completion of consecutive quarters of enroll\u00ad ment. See pages 54 and 55. A second baccalaureate applicant is a college graduate who because of a change of objective wishes to obtain a second bachelor's degree in a major different from that of the first degree. An international applicant is a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States. A University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) applicant is an accelerated high school student who wishes to pursue a particular subject beyond the level offered by the high school or perhaps an area of interest not offered by the high school in which the student meets the necessary pre\u00ad requisites. Participants enroll in one or two UCI courses on a reduced-fee basis concurrently with high school courses. Admission Requirements for California Residents The University's undergraduate admission requirements are based upon two principles: (I) that the best assurance of suc\u00ad cess in. the University is provided by a high quality of aca\u00ad demic achievement in previous work; and (2) that the study of certain subjects will give the student both good prepara\u00ad tion for study in the University and reasonable freedom in choosing a field of specialization. In addition to the high school subjects required for admission to the University, cer\u00ad tain preparatory subjects are recommended for many Univer\u00ad sity curricula to give students adequate background for their chosen field of study. The admission requirements summarized on the following pages are the minimum needed to be considered eligible for admission to UCI and other campuses of the University of California. Some campuses and programs are highly competi\u00ad tive and can accept only a limited number of students each year; completing the required high school courses with satis\u00ad factory grades may not automatically determine that a stu\u00ad dent will be selected for admission. In these cases, perfor\u00ad mance in completed courses, academic preparation, and scores received on standardized college tests (such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test and Achievement Tests or the American College Test) are among the many elements con\u00ad sidered in the selection process. Admission to Freshman Standing The University defines a freshman applicant as a student who has graduated from high school or completed a Califor\u00ad nia Certificate of Proficiency or the equivalent and who has not enrolled in a regular session of any collegiate-level insti\u00ad tution. Summer sessions are excluded in the determination. Freshman applicants who are not residents of California should refer ahead to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. Freshmen applicants who have not yet decided on a major should refer to the section on Planning an Undergraduate Program. Applicants who do not meet the scholarship requirements for admission or do not qualify by examination at the time of high school graduation may be admitted after they meet the requirements for admission in advanced standing (see p. 38). Transfer credit will be granted for an acceptable course from an accredited college or university taken while still in high school if completed after the tenth grade and if reported on a valid transcript issued by the college or community college which conducted the course. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Requirements To be eligible for admission to the University as a freshman, an applicant must meet the Subject, Scholarship, and Exami\u00ad nation requirements. It is also possible to qualify for admis\u00ad sion by examination alone, as explained in the section Admis\u00ad sion by Examination Alone. 1. UC Subject Requirement The UC subject requirement consists of several courses from six core subjects. These required courses are called the \"a through f\" subjects. Students are required to com\u00ad plete 15 \"a through f\" subjects as described below. (A one\u00ad year course is equal to one unit; a one-semester course is equal to one-half unit.) Also, at least seven of the 15 units must have been earned in courses taken during the last two years of high school. To meet the subject require\u00ad ment, these courses must appear on a certified course list which is available in the high schools for California appli\u00ad cants. The Office of Admission will review and accept courses that meet the requirements for applicants gra\u00ad duating from out-of-State schools. Specific \"A through F\" course requirements a. History: 1 year One year of United States history or one\u00ad half year of United States history and one-half year of civics or American government b. English: 4 years Four years of college-preparatory English composition and literature (All English courses must require frequent and regular prac\u00ad tice in writing expository prose compositions of some length. Only two semesters of a certified English-as-a-second\u00ad language (ESL) course will be accepted. Also, not more than two semesters of ninth grade English will be accepted for this requirement.) c. Mathematics: 3 years Three years of mathematics elemen\u00ad tary algebra, geometry, and intermediate algebra (Mathematics courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet part of this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses.) d. Laboratory Science: 1 year A one-year course in one laboratory science, taken in the tenth grade or later e. Foreign Language: 2 years Two years of one foreign lan\u00ad guage in courses that provide instruction in grammar, vocab\u00ad ulary, reading, and composition, and that emphasize the development of aural and oral skills (Foreign language courses taken in grades 7 and 8 may be used to meet this requirement if they are accepted by the high school as equivalent to its own courses.) f. College-Preparatory Electives: 4 years These units are to be chosen from at least two of the following subject areas: history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, foreign language, social science, and visual and performing arts. Students are urged to consult their high school coun\u00ad selor in the selection of course work to fulfill this requirement. The general objective of the elective program is to improve the student's analytical ability, promote their artistic devel\u00ad opment, and strengthen their oral and writing skills. Electives should involve considerable reading and writing in an amount appropriate to the course and the subject matter. The emphasis in elective courses should be to prepare for future college-level work. Courses satisfying the \"f\" requirement: History: All history courses should require extensive reading Admissions Requirements 35 and writing. Courses should enable students to establish a breadth of understanding of history (for example, world his\u00ad tory, political history, or economic history) and should pro\u00ad vide an understanding of the human past, including its rela\u00ad tion to the present. Courses should develop a student's criti\u00ad cal thinking, ability to evaluate historical data, and ability to analyze and synthesize evidence. English: All English courses should require substantial read\u00ad ing with frequent and extensive practice in writing which is carefully evaluated and criticized. A course in journalism, speech, debate, or drama is acceptable if it meets the rigor in reading and writing stated above. Advanced Mathematics: Courses in mathematics with second\u00ad year algebra as a prerequisite such as trigonometry, linear algebra, precalculus (analytic geometry and mathematical analysis), calculus, probability, and statistics are acceptable electives. A computer science course is an acceptable mathematics elec\u00ad tive if it fulfills the following objectives, The course should enable each student to express algorithms in a standard com\u00ad puter language such as PASCAL, BASIC, FORTRAN, or COBOL. By the end of the course each student should com\u00ad plete substantial programming projects in the language used. The course should also involve the study and mastery of various aspects of computer science: how computers deal with data and instructions, the internal components of a computer, and the underlying computer logic. Laboratory Science: A laboratory science course should be a course in the biological or physical sciences in which students make their own observations and measurements and analyze these data to obtain further information. On average the laboratory activities should involve an amount of time equiv\u00ad alent to at least one full class period per week. A science course in the ninth grade is an acceptable science elective provided it is designed to prepare students for labora\u00ad tory science courses in the tenth grade and beyond. The course must provide an introduction to the fundamental principles of physical and biological science. Laboratory activi\u00ad ties as defined above shall be included. (A terminal course designed only to meet graduation requirements is not an acceptable science elective.) Foreign Language: It is recommended that elective courses be in the same language used to satisfy the foreign language \"e\" subject requirement. Elective courses in this language must have at least two years of the languagt' 'lS prerequisite. In order for a second language to qualify as an elective, at least two years of this language must be completed. Social Science: Courses should be in one of the social sciences: anthropology, economics, geography, political science, psy\u00ad chology, or sociology, or, alternatively, courses should be interdisciplinary, drawing knowledge from two or more of these fields. Course objectives should include as many of the following as are applicable to the field: (I) to understand the development and basic features of major societies and cul\u00ad tures, (2) to examine the historic and contemporary ideas that have shaped the world, (3) to understand the fundamentals of how differing political and economic systems function, (4) to examine the nature and principles of individual and group behavior, and (5) to study social science methodologies. In order to develop a student's critical thinking, ability to evaluate ideas and information, and ability to analyze and synthesize qualitative and quantitative evidence in the labora\u00ad tory and in the field, a social science course must include a body of basic knowledge, extensive reading, and written and oral exposition. UC IRVINE - 1987-198836 Admissions Requirements Courses which are designed to meet State-mandated social studies graduation requirements are acceptable provided that they meet the above criteria. Courses of an applied, service, or vocational character are not acceptable social science electives. \u00b7 Visual and Performing Arts: Courses in this area consist of instruction in dance, drama/theatre, music, and the visual arts. Courses should give specific attention to as many of the fundamental arts components as possible, including the per\u00ad ceptual, the creative, the historical, or the critical as are applicable. Courses should enable students to understand and appreciate artistic expression and, where appropriate, to talk and write with discrimination about the artistic material studied. Courses devoted to developing creative artistic ability and those devoted to artistic performance should have prerequi\u00ad sites (either course work or experience approved by the instructor) and should assume proficiency beyond the intro\u00ad ductory level. Courses must require on average the equivalent of a five\u00ad period class per week. Work outside of class must be required; for example, portfolio/performance preparation, reading, writing, or critical listening/viewing. Dance courses offered for physical education credit or under any other departmental arrangement are acceptable provided they include content satisfying the above criteria. Courses which are primarily recreational, athletic, or body conditioning are not acceptable visual and performing arts electives. 2. Scholarship Requirement Applicants who attain a minimum grade point average of 3.30 (where the letter grade A= 4, B = 3, and C = 2) in \"a through f\" subjects taken after the ninth grade will be con\u00ad sidered eligible for admission to the University regardless of their scores on the standardized tests used for the examina\u00ad tion requirement. Applicants whose grade point average is below 3.30 but greater than 2.77 will be considered eligible for admission if they achieve the composite or total test score specified on the Eligibility Index (see page 00). The grade point average will be based on semester grades, unless a high school gives only year grades. (Grades earned in ninth grade or earlier are not used to calculate the grade point average for admission; however, these courses will be used to meet the subject requirement if they are completed with grades of Cor better.) As noted on page 00, in some oversubscribed University programs, applicants may be required to present academic qualifications beyond those described here. Applicants should have earned grades of Cor better in meet\u00ad ing the subject requirement. Any \"a through f\" course in which a student received a D or F grade must be repeated with a higher grade or, in sequential areas of mathematics, chemistry, and foreign language, only validated by completion of advanced course work. (Applicants should consult with their counselors as to how these grades can be remedied and how the University will use them in the evaluation of the high school record.) a. Mathematics Requirement With regard to the \"c\" subject requirement, grades earned in the third year of mathemat\u00ad ics (intermediate algebra) will be used only if they improve the student's grade point average. b. College-Preparatory Elective Courses Two of the four units in elective courses used to satisfy the \"f\" require\u00ad ment must be completed with a grade of C or better, and all four units must be accepted by the high school for grad-uation. The best grades earned in any two of these units taken in grades 10 through 12 will be used in computing the applicant's grade point average for admission. c. Honors-Level Courses The University wants to encour\u00ad age students to take demanding, advanced academic courses in high school. Grades earned in up to four units of work in courses that are (a) certified by the high school as offered at an honors level, and (b) taken in the last two years of high school will be given extra weight in comput\u00ad ing the grade point average for admission. Grades in honors courses will be counted as follows: A = 5 points, B = 4 points, and C = 3 points. To be counted, these grades must have been earned in honors courses in history, English, advanced mathematics, laboratory science, and foreign language. In these fields and additionally in the fields of computer science, social science, and the visual and performing arts, courses designed to prepare students for the Advanced Placement Examinations of the College Board and transferable col\u00ad lege courses are examples of honors-level courses. All freshman applicants must submit test scores as described below. Applicants for admission to the fall quarter should take the tests by December or January of the senior year, if possible, so that the scores will be available to the Admissions Office on those UC campuses where enrollment demands are expected to be heavy. When preliminary screening of freshman applicants is necessary in oversubscribed majors, having available scores from tests administered prior to December aids the review process. The following tests are required: 1. One Aptitude Test Either: a. The Scholastic Aptitude Test SAT (the verbal and mathe\u00ad matics scores submitted from this test must be from the same sitting); or b. The American College Test ACT composite score and 2. Three College Board Achievement Tests, which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, Ievell or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. The Achievement Test in Litera\u00ad ture may not be substituted for the English composition test. 3. Admission by Examination Alone A student can qualify as a freshman by examination alone. The required total score on the SAT is 1,100. (If the ACT is presented, the minimum score is 26.) Also, the student's total score on the three Col\u00ad lege Board Achievement Tests must be 1,650 or higher, or at least 1,730 if a nonresident of California, with no score less than 500 on any individual Achievement Test. This option does not apply to students who will have completed more than 12 transferable units prior to admission. The College Board Achievement Tests cannot be taken in academic sub\u00ad jects covered by transferable college courses a student may have taken. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Eligibility Index Applicants are admissible if their a-f grade average and test score totals are higher than the combinations below: A-F ACT* or SAT** A-F ACT* or SAT** GPA Composite Total ' GPA Composite Total 2.78 35 1600 3.05 22 970 2.79 35 1580 3.06 21 950 2.80 34 1550 3.07 21 920 2.81 34 1530 3.08 20 900 2.82 33 1510 3.09 19 880 2.83 33 1480 3.10 18 850 2.84 33 1460 3.11 18 830 2.85 32 1440 3.12 17 810 2.86 32 1410 3.13 16 780 2.87 32 1390 3.14 15 760 2.88 31 1370 3.15 14 740 2.89 31 1340 3.16 14 710 2.90 30 1320 3.17 13 690 2.91 30 1300 3.18 12 670 2.92 29 1270 3.19 11 640 2.93 29 1250 3.20 10 620 2.94 28 1230 3.21 9 600 2.95 28 1200 3.22 9 570 2.96 27 1180 3.23 8 550 2.97 27 1160 3.24 8 530 2.98 26 1130 3.25 7 500 2.99 26 1110 3.26 7 480 3.00 25 1090 3.27 6 460 3.01 25 1060 3.28 6 430 24 1040 3.29 5 410 24 1020 3.30 5 400 3.04 23 990 *ACT is scored in intervals of 1 point from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 35. **SAT is scored in intervals of 10 points from a minimum of 400 to a maximum of 1,600. Admission to the University Program for High School Scholars (UPHSS) The opportunity to enroll in University classes concurrent, usually, with the senior year of high school is available to cer\u00ad tain accelerated students (see p. 34). Admission to UPHSS is based upon a combination of criteria including grades, specific preparation in the field of interest, standardized test scores, recommendations, and statement of purpose. Through UPHSS, qualified high school students may enroll in UC Irvine courses, receive grades based on the same stan\u00ad dards as full-time students, and receive full University of California credit for their work. To continue at UC Irvine after high school graduation, a UPHSS student need only complete a change-of-major peti\u00ad tion and enroll as a full-time student. If the UPHSS partici\u00ad pant wishes to attend another University of California cam\u00ad pus, the student must follow the regular admissions process and must complete an Undergraduate Application form. The form should be stamped by the UPHSS coordinator. High school students wishing more information about the pro\u00ad gram should contact the Office of Admissions or their high school counselor. Admission as a Transfer Applicant The University defines a transfer applicant as a student who has completed high school and who has been a registered student in another college or university or in college-level extension classes other than a summer session immediately Admission Requirements/Transfer Applicants 37 following high school graduation. A transfer applicant may not disregard the college record and apply for admission as a freshman. Transfer applicants who are not residents of California should refer to the section on Nonresident Admission Requirements. Transfer Student Admission Requirements The requirements for admission as a transfer applicant vary according to the high school record. Transfer applicants who have completed a California Certificate of Proficiency or the equivalent must also meet regular University entrance requirements. The transcript submitted from the last college attended must show, as a minimum, that the student was in good standing and had earned a grade point averager of 2.00 or better. If the grade point average fell below 2.00 at any one college attended, except the last one attended, the student must have sufficient additional units and grades to offset the deficit. A transfer applicant must also meet one of the following conditions: 1. A student who met the Eligibility Index and completed all the \"a through f\" coursesz in high school may be admitted any time after establishing an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better. If a student has completed less than 12 quarter or semester units of transferable college credit since high school graduation, the student must also satisfy the examina\u00ad tion requirement for freshmen. 2. A student who met the Eligibility Index but had not studied one or more of the required courses in high school may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.00 or better in another college or university; and b. completed, with a grade of Cor better, appropriate college courses in the high school subjects lacked; and c. completed 12 or more quarter or semester transferable units, or met the examination requirement for freshmen. 3. A student who was not eligible for admission as a fresh\u00ad man because the Eligibility Index was not met or a combina\u00ad tion of not meeting the Eligibility Index and lacking the required subjects, may be admitted after the student has: a. established an overall grade point average of 2.40 or better in another college or university; and 1The grade point average is determined by dividing the total number of acceptable units attempted into the number of grade points earned on those units. A student may repeat courses completed with a grade lower than C up to a maximum of 16 quarter units without penalty. The scholarship standard is expressed by a system of grade points and grade point averages earned in courses accepted by the Univer\u00ad sity for advanced standing credit. Grade points are assigned as fol\u00ad lows: for each unit of A, 4 points; B, 3 points; C, 2 points; D, 1 point; I and F, no points; P/NP, no points but are included in the unit total. 2The following \"a through f\" courses are required of students grad\u00ad uating before June 1986: one year of U.S. history, four years of Eng\u00ad lish, two years of mathematics, one year of laboratory science, two years of foreign language, one or two years of advanced courses (one year of advanced mathematics, or one year of laboratory sci\u00ad ence besides the course used for the laboratory science requirement, or a third year in the foreign language used for the foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement, or two years of another foreign language). Stu\u00ad dents graduating June 1986 and thereafter will have to meet the new academic requirements outlined on. pages 35-36. UC IRVINE - 1987-198838 Nonresident Admission b. completed 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of college credit in courses accepted by the University for transfer; and c. completed one of the following two options: i. With a grade of C or better, (1) one college course in mathematics which has algebra I as a prerequisite; the course may be geometry, algebra II, or a more advanced course and does not have to be transferable; (2) one transferable course in English; and (3) one transferable course selected from U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language, or ii. Appropriate college courses, with grades of C or better in the \"a through f\" subjects that the student lacked. Up to two units of high school work in \"a through f\" subjects will be waived, but transfer applicants must have satisfied the freshman admission requirements of four years of college\u00ad preparatory English and two years of mathematics (part of the \"a through f\" requirements). Transfer applicants are referred to Planning to Transfer, page 43. Admission for a Second Bachelor's Degree A student whose educational objective has changed substan\u00ad tially after receiving the bachelor's degree may be considered for admission to a program for a second degree. Admission as a candidate for a second bachelor's degree requires that the applicant be fully eligible for admission to the University and have strong promise of academic success in the new major. All such admissions are subject to the approval of the dean or director of the UCI school or program in which the second degree will be earned. Students who have not attended UCI as undergraduates dur\u00ad ing a regular academic quarter should complete an Applica\u00ad tion for Undergraduate Admission and a Supplementary Information for Second Baccalaureate Applicants form, avail\u00ad able from the Office of Admissions. Students who have attended UCI as undergraduates during a regular academic quarter should obtain and complete a Second Baccalaureate Application form through the Registrar's Office. Nonresident Admission Requirements: NOTE: Admission requirements for applicants who are not California residents vary slightly from requirements for Cali\u00ad fornia residents. Nonresident Freshman Applicant A nonresident freshman applicant must (1) graduate from a regionally or state-accredited high school, or complete an appropriate proficiency examination (see p. 00); (2) complete satisfactorily the \"a through f\" pattern of subject require\u00ad ments listed under requirements for California residents; (3) earn a grade point average of at least 3.40 or higher in the required high school subjects (3.00 is equal to a B average); and (4) meet the examination requirement: one Aptitude Test either the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) (verbal and mathematics scores must be from the same sitting) or the American College Test (ACT) composite score and three Col\u00ad lege Board Achievement Tests which must include (a) English composition, (b) mathematics, Ievell or 2, and (c) one from among English literature, foreign languages, sciences, or social studies. (The Achievement Test in Literature may not be substituted for the English composition test.) Please note that the Freshman Eligibility Index applies to California residents only. To be admitted by examination alone, a nonresident applicant must score either 1,100 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test or 26 on the American College Test. The total score on the three College Board Achievement Tests must be 1,730 or higher with a score of at least 500 on each test. Nonresident Transfer Applicant A student who met the admission requirements for freshman admission as a nonresident must have a grade point average of 2.80 or higher in college courses that are accepted by the University for transfer credit. A nonresident applicant who graduated from high school with less than a 3.40 grade point average in the subjects required for freshman admission must have completed at least 84 quarter units (56 semester units) of transferable work with a grade point average of 2.80 or higher. Upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of that work, two units of the required high school subjects may be waived but transfer applicants must have satisfied the freshman entrance requirements of four years of college-preparatory English and two years of mathematics (part of the \"a through f\" requirements). A stu\u00ad dent who lacked any of the required subjects in high school must complete, with a grade of C or better, appropriate col\u00ad lege courses in those subjects, or (1) one college course in mathematics which has algebra I as a prerequisite (the course may be geometry, algebra II, or a more advanced course and does not have to be transferable), (2) one transferable course in English, and (3) one course in U.S. history, a laboratory science, or a foreign language which is transferable to the University of California. Exceptions to Nonresident Admission Requirements For admission purposes only, a person residing outside of Cali\u00ad fornia may be determined by the Office of Admissions to be a bona fide resident and may be considered under California resident admission requirements if the applicant: is a spouse of a University of California faculty member; is a spouse of military personnel assigned to California; is a military dependent who has been granted a nonresident fee waiver; is an immigrant who has lived in California for a year and has chosen California as a place of residence; is a minor applicant whose parent or legal guardian appears to be a legal resident of California (as determined by the University for tuition purposes); has spent any two years or the last term enrolled in a California high school; has spent the last term (in at least 12 transferable units) enrolled in an accredited California col\u00ad lege or university; has been physically present in California continuously for at least one year prior to the quarter for which registration is requested; or if one parent has received a degree from the University of California or is a full-time employee of the University of California. Nonresident Tuition Fee Refer to page 26 for information regarding residence classifi\u00ad cation for tuition purposes and the Nonresident Tuition Fee. Bona fide residents are still held for Nonresident Tuition. Admission of International Students The credentials of an international undergraduate applicant\u00ad a student who holds or expects to hold a student, exchange, visitor, or diplomatic visa and who wishes to attend school in the United States are evaluated in accordance with the gen\u00ad eral regulations governing admission. However, it is possible that international applicants to oversubscribed programs may not be offered admission to either their first-choice campus UC IRVINE - 1987-1988or to another University of California campus. An applica\u00ad tion, official certificates, and detailed transcripts of records should be submitted to the Office of Admissions early in the appn;>priate application filing period. This will allow time for exchange of necessary correspondence and, if the applicant is admitted, will help the student in obtaining the necessary passport visa. International applicants whose native language is other than English will be required to demonstrate their English profi\u00ad ciency. This is most often accomplished by achieving a min\u00ad imum score of 550 on the Test of English as a Foreign Lan\u00ad guage (TOEFL). The admission of otherwise eligible appli\u00ad cants who do not meet this requirement will be deferred until it is possible for them to demonstrate an adequate level of English ability. Arrangements to take the TOEFL may be made. by writing directly to TOEFL, Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 899, Princeton, New Jersey 08540. Students must request the Educational Testing Service to forward results of their tests to the Office of Admissions. Completion of an acceptable English composition course (as determined by the Offiee of Admissions) with a grade of C or better will also clear the English proficiency requirement for interna\u00ad tional applicants. Prospective students who wish to improve their English pro\u00ad ficiency tomeet the TOEFL requirement may enroll in the intensive Program in English as a Second Language spon\u00ad sored by University Extension. Requests for information should be addressed to Program in English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage, University of California Extension, P.O. Box AZ, Irvine, CA 92716. See page 55 for additional information. In addition to achieving a minimum TOEFL score of 550, all international students must take an English as a Second Lan\u00ad guage Placement Test upon arrival and prior to registration. Based upon the results of this test, students may be required to improve certain language skills by enrolling in English as a Second Language courses during the freshman year with other major course work being adjusted accordingly. Generally, financial assistance and scholarships from the Uni\u00ad versity are not available to the nonimmigrant-visa student. International students must provide proof that sufficient funds will be available to meet their educational commit\u00ad ments while studying in the United States. International undergraduate students are considered as nonresidents of California and are required to pay the nonresident tuition in addition to fees paid by legal residents of California. Please direct all inquiries regarding the undergraduate admis\u00ad sion of international students to the Office of Admissions. English Language Proficiency of Permanent Resident, Refugee, and International (F-1 Visa) Students: English as a Second Language Any permanent resident, refugee, or international student whose first or native language is other than English and who has a score on the verbal section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) of .350 or less, or any such student without a ver\u00ad bal SAT score, must, regardless of the student's TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score, take an English as a Second Language Placement Test (ESLPT) prior to the first quarter of enrollment. The placement test is given prior to the beginning of each quarter, during Student-Parent Orien\u00ad tation Program (SPOP) weekends in the summer, and during Academic Advising and Orientation (\"0\") Week prior to the beginning of fall quarter instruction. Information concerning when and where the test will be given and the test itself can be obtained frorri the Program of Academic Support Services International Student Admission/Application Procedures 39 Office (telephone 714-856-6206) and the Office of English as a Second Language (telephone 714-856-6781). Based upon the results of the ESL Placement Test, students may be required to enroll in ESL courses prior to enrolling in any other required writing courses. Students required to enroll in ESL courses must begin satisfying their ESL requirements within their first or second quarter at UCI. They must take these courses in consecutive quarters. The ESL requirements are to be completed within the first six quarters at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the ESL requirement by the end of their sixth quarter will be ineligi\u00ad ble to enroll for a seventh quarter at UCI. Subject-A must be taken the quarter following the completion of ESL requirements. ESL courses, offered by the School of Humanities, include classes in writing, speaking and listening, and reading and vocabulary development. See page 158 for course descriptions. Credit for English-as-a-Second-Language Course Work Students whose first language is not English may receive up to 12 baccalaureate credits for English-as-a-second-language course work. Students may receive workload credit for courses taken beyond this 12-unit limit but will not receive additional credits applicable to the bachelor's degree. Credit for Native Language Students whose first language is not English may receive credit for course work in their native language and literature, provided such courses were completed on the college level in the country of the vernacular, or on the upper-division or graduate level at UCI or another accredited English-speaking institution. Application Procedures Application packets for undergraduate admission to the Uni\u00ad versity are available from the counseling office of any Cali\u00ad fornia high school or community college, or from any Uni\u00ad versity of California Admissions Office. Students applying for admission to UCI should complete the application and submit it according to the instructions pro\u00ad vided in the 1987-88 Undergraduate Application Packet. A nonrefundable application fee of $3Smust accompany the application. This basic fee entitles the applicant to be con\u00ad sidered at one campus; for each additional campus selected, an additional $20 fee is required. Applicants concerned with admission or application procedure questions specific to UC Irvine should communicate directly with the Office of Admis\u00ad sions, 245 Administration Building, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717. UC IRVINE - 1987-198840 Application Procedures When to Apply for Admission To ensure that applications will be considered for admission by both UCI (or other University campuses) and the stu\u00ad dent's choice of major or program of study, the completed application and the application fee should be filed during the Priority Filing Period. Each campus accepts for consideration all applications it receives during this period. Early filing is encouraged for students who plan to apply also for financial aid, University housing, or other special programs. Addition\u00ad ally, students required to fulfill the examination requirements for freshman admission should make arrangements to take the standardized tests early; by December of the senior year is recommended. Quarter to be Admitted at UCI Winter quarter, 1988 Spring quarter, 1988 Fall quarter, 1988 Winter quarter, 1989 Spring quarter, 1989 Priority Application Filing Dates File July 1-30, 1987 File October 1-30, 1987 File November 1-30, 1987 File July 1-30, 1988 File October 1-30, 1988 After the priority filing period has ended, campuses will accept applications only if they still have openings for new students. This means that some campuses may still be able to accept additional applications and others may not. Adding a Campus If the campus or campuses being considered are still accepting applications, students may, after submitting their application, add additional campus choice(s) to that or those initially listed on their application. A $20 fee for each additional campus will be required. Students should contact the Admissions Office on the campus to be added for information on which pro\u00ad grams are still open and the procedures for adding campuses. Students should be aware that processing an additional cam\u00ad pus choice will take several weeks before the new campus actually receives the application and data. Students should also be aware that special program commitments, such as the Educational Opportunity Program or UCLA's Academic Advancement Program may vary from campus to campus. At UCL the Office of Admissions notifies the Financial Aid and Housing Office about a student's request for these services after the application is received and processed at UCI. Stu\u00ad dents can communicate with the Housing or Financial Aid Office directly for information about deadlines, priorities, and availability of these services. Transcripts The Office of Admissions requires complete, accurate, and up-to-date information about a student's academic program and work in progress in order to process and respond to the application in a timely manner. The transcript and other doc\u00ad uments submitted as part of the application become the property of the University; they cannot be returned or for\u00ad warded in any form to another college or university. All applicants are responsible for having official transcripts of their high school and college course work forwarded to the Admissions Office at the University campus(es) to which they have applied. Freshman Applicant. The campus to which the student has applied will notify the student if a preliminary high school tran\u00ad script is required. The student is also responsible for asking testing agencies to report examination scores for either the 'SAT or ACT tests and three Achievement Tests to those Admissions Offices. An official final high school transcript show-ing a statement of graduation must also be forwarded to the campus that the student has decided to register and enroll. A California Certificate of Proficiency, the results from a proficiency test from any state, or a General Education Development (GED) Certificate can be accepted in place of a high school diploma. Transfer Applicant. Transfer applicants must request a transcript from each college attended, including, if possible, a listing of courses in progress from the student's current college. A transcript from the last high school attended also should be requested. Attendance at any other school or college after an application to the Univer\u00ad sity has been filed is considered to be part of the record and must be reported to the Office of Admissions. Examination Arrangements Students should make arrangements to take the required tests with the Educational Testing Service, College Board/\u00ad ATP, 1947 Center Street, Berkeley, California 94704, or College Board/ATP, P.O. Box 592, Princeton, New Jersey 08540 for SAT and Achievement Tests. For the ACT, stu\u00ad dents should write to the American College Testing Program Registration Unit, P.O. Box 168, Iowa City, Iowa 52240. (Test fees should be paid to the testing services, not the Univer\u00ad sity.) At the same time the test is taken, students should request that their scores be reported to the Office of Admis\u00ad sions. To prevent confusion or unnecessary delay, it is impor\u00ad tant to use precisely the same form of the student's name on both the application for admission and the test materials. In 1987-88 SAT and Achievement Tests will be offered con\u00ad currently oil the following Saturday mornings: October 10, 1987 (SAT only January 23, 1988 in California, Florida, Georgia, March 19, 1988 (SAT only) Illinois, North Carolina, South M 7 1988 Carolina, and Texas) ay ' November 7, 1987 June 4 1988 December 5, 1987 The 1987-88 ACT Tests will be offered on the following dates: October 24, 1987 December 12, 1987 February 17, 1988 April16, 1988 June 11, 1988 Details on testing are available from the Coliege Board, the American College Testing Program, and from most high school counseling offices. Notification of Admission Most fall quarter applicants are notified of their admission to the University by late spring; transfer applicants rrtay be noti\u00ad fied somewhat later. (There are similar notification periods for other quarters.) In many cases, complete transcripts of coursework are required before a final decision can be made. Statement of Intention to Register Students who are accepted for admission will receive, with their notification of admission, a Statement of Intention to Register (SIR) form. The SIR serves to notify each campus of the student's decision to accept or not accept its offer of admission. Before completing and returning the form, stu\u00ad dents who have applied to more than one campus are advised to take as much time as is appropriate in considering their responses to each campus. However, it is essential that stu- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988dents allow enough time to meet the deadline for returning their SIR. Once they have decided on which campus to attend, students should submit their positive SIR and nonre\u00ad fundable $100 deposit* (if applicable) to the campus Admis\u00ad sions Office. Students should not submit a positive SIR to more than one campus. Additionally, once the positive SIR and fee have been received, the student cannot transfer to another UC campus. Freshman students entering in the fall quarter must return their positive SIR by May 1, or, if admitted at a later date, by the date stamped on the SIR. Transfer students entering in a fall quarter must return their positive SIR by June 1, or, if admitted later, by the date stamped on the SIR. Students entering in a winter or spring quarter must return the SIR within three weeks from the date of their notifica\u00ad tion of admission. Admission to UCI is not an assurance of receiving financial aid nor does it guarantee assignment to University housing. Separate applications are required of applicants desiring financial aid or University housing, and receipt of communications from the Finan\u00ad cial Aid Office, the Housing Office, or any office other than the Admissions Office does not imply that eligibility for admission has been established. Part-Time Study UCI offers several possibilities to pursue part-time study for credit leading to an undergraduate or graduate degree. Part\u00ad time study opportunities are available in academic units in which there exists good educational reason, as determined by the academic unit, to allow part-time study. For part-time study, quarterly course enrollment is limited to 10 units or less for undergraduate students and to eight units or less for graduate students; these limits include physical education units. The same admissions standards that apply to full-time stu\u00ad dents apply to part-time students. Under University policy, academic deans (the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students) may approve Petitions for Part-Time Status for reasons of occupation, family responsibilities, or health. In approved part-time status, one-half of the Educational Fee and one-half of the Nonresident Tuition (if applicable) are assessed. Undergraduate petitions are available from aca\u00ad demic counselors or the Registrar's Office; graduate students may obtain further information and petitions from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Since there are certain restrictions on receiving undergraduate credit for part-time course work, undergraduates interested in part-time study should read, in addition to the Undergraduate Admissions section, the sections on Expenses and Fees, and Financial Aid. Graduate students should refer to the Research and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies section. Additional Information Recommended Subjects Many University programs require or recommend specific preparatory subjects to give students the needed background in their chosen fields of study. The lack of such preparation, particularly for transfer students, may delay graduation from the University. Details about these recommendations can be found in Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects, a Univer\u00ad sity publication sent each year to high school and community college counselors. *Effective for falll988 applicants. Additional Information 41 Subject A and American History and Institutions To be eligible for a bachelor's degree from UC Irvine, stu\u00ad dents must meet a number of requirements, including those of the University of California, the Irvine campus, and the individual school and major. There are two requirements\u00ad Subject A (English Composition) and American History and Institutions-which all University of California students must satisfy in order to graduate. For specific information on these requirements and ways to satisfy them before entrance to UCI, refer to page 48 College-Level Courses The University gives unit credit to students for courses they have completed in other accredited colleges or universities. To be accepted for unit credit, the courses must be consistent with those offered by the University. All applicants with questions regarding transfer of credit should contact the Office of Admissions. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) The University does not grant credit for the College Level Examination Program. Advanced Placement The University wishes to encourage students to take demanding advanced courses in all fields. Information about honors-level courses that can be used to meet the Scholarship requirement is found on page 36. Advanced Placement courses completed during the last two years of high school qualify for honors grade points (to a maximum of four units). In addition to honors grade points, the University grants eight quarter units of elective credit toward the bachelor's degree for each Advanced Placement examination passed with a score of 3, 4, or 5. (Exceptions: four quarter units are given for the American Government exam, for the Compara\u00ad tive Government exam, for the Computer Science exam, for the Mathematics AB exam, for each Latin exam, and for Physics C, Part 1, 2; eight units are given for one or both of the English, Music, Studio Art, and Physics B and C exams.) The chart below shows Advanced Placement credit in satis\u00ad faction of UCI breadth and graduation requirements. Addi\u00ad tional use of Advanced Placement credit often is made on an individual basis. For information on the UCI breadth requirement, please consult pages 49 and 50. High School Proficiency Examination The University of California will accept the California Certifi\u00ad cate of Proficiency, awarded by the State Department of Edu\u00ad cation upon successful completion of the California High School Proficiency Examination, in lieu of the regular high school diploma. The University also will accept proficiency examinations from other states and the General Educational Development (GED) examination results in place of a diploma. However, all other University entrance require\u00ad ments (subject pattern, grades, tests) must be met. The date of high school graduation on University records will be the date of the certificate. Entrance by standardized test scores will remain an option for the student ineligible on the basis of the high school record. Physical Examination All new students and those returning after an absence of two or more quarters require physical examinations and health clearances, respectively, before the first day of the quarter. See the section on Student Health.

Information regarding eligibility for transfer may be found in the section on Admission of Transfer Students, page 37. Unit Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The University of California grants unit credit for courses completed in other accredited colleges and universities when such courses are consistent with the functions of the Univer\u00ad sity as set forth in the Master Plan for Higher Education in California. Equivalent advanced standing credit from institu\u00ad tions on the semester calendar may be determined at a ratio of one semester unit to one and one-half quarter units. (To graduate from UCI 180 quarter units, equivalent to 45 UCI quarter courses, are needed.)

High school graduates who cannot be accommo\u00ad dated at their first University of California campus prefer\u00ad ence may choose to attend a community college and transfer to their preferred University campus at a later time. A stu\u00ad dent may earn a maximum of 105 quarter units (70 semester units) toward a University degree in a community college. No further unit credit may be transferred from a community col\u00ad lege, although subject, major, or breadth credit for courses taken will still be granted. Students anticipating transfer to UCI are urged to consult with their community college counselors. The community college counselor, with the aid of that college's transferable course list, can advise students about courses which will transfer to the University. Lists for each community college are updated annually and tell which courses will transfer and for how many units. In addition to the community college counselor, staff in the Office of Admissions and Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges keep current copies and can advise students about the transferability of courses. Four-Year Institutions Unit credit is granted for courses consistent with the Univer\u00ad sity of California's functions and which have been completed in colleges or universities accredited by the appropriate agen\u00ad cies. While limitations of credit may be imposed in certain UC IRVINE - 1987-198844 Transfer Students subject areas, these are consonant with the curricula for all students in the University of California. No defined maxi\u00ad mum number of units which can be earned toward the degree is set for students transferring from four-year institu\u00ad tions. However, see pages 48-50 for UCI graduation require\u00ad ments, including requirements for units earned in residence at this campus. University of California Extension Extension courses prefixed by XB, XD, XI, XR, XSB, and XSD are granted unit credit on the same basis as courses taken in residence at any accredited collegiate institution. Students intending to transfer Extension course credit for a degree at another college or university should verify accep\u00ad tance of the course with that institution. Resident students of the University of California must obtain the consent of the dean of their school or college prior to enrolling for credit in an Extension course. Extension courses are not accepted as part of the residence requirements of the University. Grades earned in University Extension are not used in calculating the University grade point average. Decisions regarding the acceptability of extension courses taken in institutions other than the University of California rest with the Office of Admissions. Decisions regarding the applicability of such courses toward specific degrees and majors rest with the respective faculties. Course Credit for Work Taken Elsewhere The policies above refer only to the unit transferability of courses and are uniformly implemented on all campuses of the University. Thus, courses which are determined by the University of California to be transferable are assured only of being granted elective course credit. The application of transfer work to specific course and major requirements is determined by the student's academic dean. The Irvine campus makes every effort to eliminate all bar\u00ad riers to orderly progress from California community colleges into UCI's programs. To this end, many community colleges have entered into articulation agreements with UCI so that the specific application of their courses to UCI's University, school, and departmental major requirements may be readily communicated to prospective transfer students. Students are urged to consult community college counselors or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges for specific informa\u00ad tion on planning a program for transfer. The University of California bulletin Prerequisites and Recommended Subjects should also be consulted for planning the lower-division course of study for all programs offered on the campuses of the University of California. Requirements Requirements at UCI are in four categories: those for the University of California, UCI, school, and departmental or major. Courses not specifically applicable to these are con\u00ad sidered to be electives. See pages 48-50 for a description of these requirements. University of California Requirements: Subject A and American History and Institutions Among the means of meeting the Subject A requirement is the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) transfer course in English compo\u00ad sition with a grade of Cor better. The American History and Institutions requirement may be met by completing in high school one year of U.S. history or one semester of U.S. history and one semester of U.S. government with a grade of at least C, or upon certification by another California collegiate institution. UCI Breadth Requirement Transfer students transferring to UCI must satisfy this requirement through completion of the current UCI breadth requirement or through one of the other options indicated below. The breadth requirement, which must be completed prior to graduation, may be satisfied by college-level courses appropriate to UCI offerings and may be met at any time dur\u00ad ing the undergraduate years, except in the case of the writing requirement. Once a student matriculates to UCJ, the stu\u00ad dent can take only UCI courses to satisfy the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Transfer students should not feel that the breadth requirement must necessar\u00ad ily be completed during their freshman and sophomore years. See pages 50-51 for details on the breadth and other gradua\u00ad tion requirements. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that col\u00ad lege will be considered to have met the total breadth require\u00ad ment of UCI except for the upper-division writing require\u00ad ment. Students who transfer from a community college and who have met the general breadth requirements of any cam\u00ad pus of the University of California prior to transfer will also be regarded as having met the breadth requirement except for the upper-division writing requirement. Students who, upon transfer, have not completed whatever breadth requirements may have been in progress for another campus of the University of California may elect to complete at UCI either that program (except for the upper-division writing requirement) or the current UCI breadth requirement. Students transferring from another institution may satisfy the UCI breadth requirement (p. 50-52) by completing a year sequence (two semesters work, minimum six semester units, or three quarters work, minimum 12 quarter units) in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences Ill. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science Students transferring to UCI should refer to the following detailed guidelines on how to satisfy the breadth requirement in each area: I. Writing. The lower-division writing requirement may be met by a year sequence in English composition. Courses used to meet the lower-division writing requirement must be completed with a minimum grade of C, or a Pass, or Credit grade equivalent to C. Transfer students may not count any course designed exclusively for the satisfaction of Subject A toward the completion of the lower-division requirement. Any student entering with only one semester or one quarter of English composition through which the Subject A Requirement is fulfilled will not have satisfied any part of the writing requirement. Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-and upper-division writing requirements. II. Natural Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: general biology, gen\u00ad eral chemistry, basic physics, or by two-semester or three\u00ad quarter approved courses in biological sciences or physical sciences with the exception of mathematics. These courses may or may not include a laboratory. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. This requirement may be met by a year of work in any of the following areas: anthro\u00ad pology, comparative culture, economics, geography, political science, psychology, sociology, or social ecology. Students on the semester system may elect to take an introductory course followed by a second course in the same area or an introduc\u00ad tory course from each of any two areas; students on the quarter system may elect to take three courses in one area, or two courses from one area and a third from another area. History, for the purposes of the breadth requirement, is not considered a social or behavioral science. (See IV, Humanistic Inquiry.) IV. Humanistic Inquiry. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, comparative litera\u00ad ture, dramatic literature, art history, history of music, nature and theory of art. Performance courses may not be used in satisfaction of this requirement. V. Foreign language, linguistics, logic, Mathematics, Com\u00ad puter Science. This requirement may be met by a year sequence in one of the following areas: probability and statis\u00ad tics, calculus, logic, linguistics, computer science, or comple\u00ad tion of the second year in a foreign language. In satisfying the above requirements, a student may count toward breadth no more than a year of work taken within the discipline of the major. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than two semester courses or three quarter courses in Philosophy toward breadth. Transfer students should check with the academic counselor in their prospective major, the Office of Admissions, or the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges about courses that may be used to satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. A complete description of the breadth requirement is on pages 49-50. NOTE FOR PHYSICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: In addition to the courses taken to fulfill the UCI breadth requirement, students majoring in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional year sequence from one of the following breadth areas: Social and Behavioral Sciences (III), Humanistic Inquiry (IV), or the Foreign Languages or Lin\u00ad guistics section of Category V. For purposes of this require\u00ad ment, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that a year sequence of a single foreign language at the first level is acceptable. NOTE FOR BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES MAJORS: By satisfy\u00ad ing the lower-division Writing requirement (I) and complet\u00ad ing a year sequence of courses selected from classics, history, philosophy, humanities, English literature, or comparative literature toward the Humanistic Inquiry (IV) breadth requirement, students majoring in Biological Sciences can also satisfy the Humanities requirement for their major. The courses and descriptions listed elsewhere in this Cata\u00ad logue may be used by prospective transfer students as a guide for selecting courses of similar content and purpose in their own institutions. However, it is strongly advised that they consult with their counselors to verify the transferabil\u00ad ity of such courses and the applicability to the breadth requirement. No student who has taken a course which is accepted for credit by the Office of Admissions and which has been mutually determined with a community college in accordance with the policies stated on page 49 as being accep\u00ad table toward completion of the breadth requirement shall incur any loss of credit in satisfaction of the requirement. Transfer Students 45 Commencement. the highlight of the academic year, is held each june in Aldrich Park. Last year 2,029 students received degrees. School Requirements Since school requirements occasi~nally cross school lines (e.g., physical science requirements for all majors in the School of Biological Sciences), courses taken to fulfill a school requirement may at the same time be applicable toward the University breadth requirement unless the school designates otherwise. Also, courses taken to fulfill a departmental major requirement may at the same time fulfill a school require\u00ad ment or, within prescribed limits, the University breadth requirement. Courses from many California community colleges have been reviewed by UCI faculty and approved as acceptable toward meeting specific lower-division requirements for breadth or the major. Although course equivalencies for the breadth requirement may be liberally interpreted for purposes of transfer, courses to be applied toward school and departmen\u00ad tal major requirements must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in unit value and in content. By careful selection of courses, it is possible for students to satisfy some or all of the lower-division requirements of their intended program or school prior to transfer. Departmental or Major Requirements Courses to be applied toward departmental or major require\u00ad ments must be more precisely equated with UCI courses in content and purpose than is the case with courses applicable to the breadth requirement (see p. 50 and departmental sec\u00ad tions). Prospective transfer students should consult with their counselors as to the applicability of courses toward UCI requirements. Prospective transfer students should address specific in\u00ad quiries about their programs to the respective schools or departments at UCI. Community colleges wishing to clarify the status of transfer courses should consult with the Office of Relations with Schools and Colleges at Irvine. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Information for Admitted Students Planning an Undergraduate Program Academic Advising At the time of admission to UCI every undergraduate stu\u00ad dent is assigned to the school or program that offers the stu\u00ad dent's selected major. Students who have not declared a major receive assistance from the General Studies Advising Program until they select an academic major. Jurisdiction over all questions of academic regulations and academic standing rests with the dean or director of the school or program to which a student is assigned. Therefore, each academic unit maintains a system which provides aca\u00ad demic advising and processes requests to add or drop courses, waive or change graduation or other requirements, or change the major. Students are responsible for knowing the govern\u00ad ing regulations of the school or program to which they are assigned. Each academic unit is responsible for maintaining a system which provides academic advising. These systems differ among the academic units. In some, all of the faculty serve as advisors; in others, only certain members of the faculty are designated as advisors. All advising offices include academic counselors, professionals who assist students in planning their program, selecting a major, and making progress toward a degree. Peer academic advisors (trained upper\u00ad division students) assist students in the same areas as aca\u00ad demic counselors, and answer questions relating to student life issues, providing student perspective. Responsibility for informing students of the names of their advisors rests with the dean or director of the appropriate academic unit. This is done normally by letter; however, students may obtain information by telephone from the office of the appropriate dean or director (see separate listing). A student may request a change of advisor through the chief academic advisor or the dean of the unit. New students are encouraged to plan their academic pro\u00ad grams with an academic counselor shortly after being ad\u00ad mitted. The optimum time to initiate contact with an aca\u00ad demic counselor is before the student enrolls in classes. The academic counselor can help the student determine whether the classes the student wishes to take are appropriate to the student's level of preparation, whether the proposed classes fit within the student's educational goals, and whether the classes will help meet some of the requirements for graduation. In some schools and programs, consultation between stu\u00ad dents and their faculty advisors is mandatory. Regardless of whether or not consultation between student and advisor is required, students are responsible for initiating and maintain\u00ad ing periodic contact with their assigned faculty advisor. An appropriate time for the initial contact is during the week prior to the beginning of the student's first classes at UCI, or earlier at the time of registration if this is possible. There\u00ad after, consultation between student and advisor at the time of registration for each subsequent quarter is desirable. The actual frequency of these meetings will be determined by the desires of the student, the advisor, and the unit's governing regulations. Each quarter, new students are required to go to the appro\u00ad priate academic dean's office prior to the beginning of classes for advice concerning class enrollment and to pick up a Class Verification and Identification Card. These procedures for new students and provisions for continuing students are explained in detail in the quarterly Schedule of Classes. Advising Personnel Biological Sciences Albert F.

The honors programs offer some of the advantages usually associated with selective liberal arts colleges: rigor\u00ad ous, small, personalized classes and the intellectual exchange that creates a community of scholars. The difference, how\u00ad ever, is that UCI's programs have the support and benefit of the 2lcmillion-volume library system of the University of California (of which UCI Library collections number some 1,200,000 volumes) and of the numerous state-of-the-art laboratories on the campus. Honors programs are offered at either the freshman\u00ad sophmore level or the junior-senior level. At the freshman\u00ad sophmore level, UCl offers the Humanities Honors Program, which allows superior students regardless of major to satisfy graduation requirements in writing and in humanistic inquiry. During their freshman year, students participate in special honors sections of the Hum\u00b7anities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C). Sophmore students take a year-long interdisciplinary course organized around a single topic or problem (such as crime and punishment, the development of religion in the west, or the \"American Dream\"). At the junior-senior level, honors programs are offered to majors in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences (in economics, political science, and psychology), the Department of Information and Computer Science, and the Program in Sociai Ecology. The focal point of each of these programs is the development of analytical and research skills through pursuit of research under faculty supervision. Additional information about the honors programs is included in the School of Humanities section, the School of Social Sciences section, the Department of Information and Computer Sciences section, and the Program-in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy section. Preparation for Graduate or Professional Study \u00b7 Undergraduate students ought to keep the possibility of future graduate or professional study in mind as they plan their academic programs, and they should discuss their career goals with their advisors. Students who have an idea of the direction in which they would like to go should familiarize themselves with the basic requirements for postbaccalaureate study and keep those requirements in mind when selecting courses. Further, students should supplement their under\u00ad graduate programs by anticipating foreign language require\u00ad ments at major graduate schools and by intensive work in areas outside their major that are of special relevance to their intended graduate work. For information about graduate or professional study in a given field, students may consult the graduate advisor or an academic counselor in the academic unit corresponding to the area of interest. Also, the Career Planning and Placement Center frequently sponsors seminars on specific career areas and offers a number of services useful to those considering graduate or professional study. UC IRVINE - 1987-198848 Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree Supplementary Educational Programs There are several supplementary educational opportunities available to students at UCI: University Extension, Summer Sessions, the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program, the Naval ROTC program, and two Uni\u00ad versitywide activities, the Education Abroad Program and the Education at Horne Program. The Education Abroad Program offers students the opportunity to experience a different cul\u00ad ture while making progress toward degree requirements. The Education at Horne Program enables participants inter\u00ad ested in early American history and culture to spend a quar\u00ad ter in Williamsburg, Virginia; Philadelphia; and Washington, D.C. For further information on each of these programs, please see pages 55-57. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree There are four requirements that must be met to obtain a baccalaureate degree from UCI: University, UCI, School, and departmental. Each is described below. University Requirements 1. English (\"Subject A\"). Every undergraduate must demon\u00ad strate upon entrance to the University an acceptable level of ability in English composition. This requirement may be met before entrance by: a. Achieving a grade 5, 4, or 3 in either of the two College Board Advanced Placement Examinations in English; or b. Achieving a score of 600 or better in the College Board English Composition Achievement Test; or c. Completing the California State University English Equi\u00ad valency Test with \"Pass for Credit\"; or d. Entering the University with credentials from another col\u00ad lege which show the completion of an acceptable one-quarter (four units) or one-semester (three units) course in English composition with a grade of Cor better. NOTE: High school English courses will not satisfy this option. Those students who have not met the Subject A requirement before entrance must satisfy the requirement before the beginning of their fourth quarter at UCI. Students who have not satisfied the requirement by that time will be ineligible to enroll for a fourth quarter. Students enrolled in Humanities 20A-B-C-D (Writing for Students for Whom English is a Second Language) must meet the Subject A requirement before the beginning of the fourth quarter after they have been authorized to take Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature WR39A or the Writing Workshop. This requirement may be met after admission by one of the following three options: a. Passing the Universitywide Subject A Examination given on May 16 to all entering freshmen admitted for fall quarter, 1987. Transfer students who have not satisfied the Subject A requirement should contact the UCI Composition Program Office (220 Humanities Office Building) for evaluation; tele\u00ad phone (714) 856-6717. b. Taking the Writing Workshop (this option is available only to those students enrolled in the Humanities Core Course). (NOTE: Students held for Subject A and enrolled in the Humanities Core Course will be required to enroll concur\u00ad rently in the Writing Workshop during their first quarter. Successful completion of the Writing Workshop will satisfy the Subject A requirement.) c. Taking English and Comparative Literature WR39A and receiving a letter grade of at least a C in that course (the Pass/Not Pass option may not be used to satisfy the Subject A requirement). This option is available only to those stu\u00ad dents who score below 600 on the College Board English Composition Achievement Test and who have followed neither option (a) or (b) above. 2. American History and Institutions. This requirement may be met by one of the following: a. Completion in high school of one year of United States history with grades of C or better, or one semester of United States history and one semester of United States government with grades of C or better. b. Receiving a score of 5, 4, or 3 in the Advanced Placement Examination in United States History. c. Receiving a score of 500 or higher in the College Board Achievement Test in American History and Social Studies. d. Presentation of a certificate of completion of the require\u00ad ment at another California institution. e. Completion at another institution of one year of college\u00ad level United States history with grades of Cor better, or one course in United States history and one in United States government with grades of Cor better. f. Completion at UCI, with a grade of C or better, a lower\u00ad division, four-unit course in American history (when Ameri\u00ad can history is taught in History 6 or 9) and Social Sciences 23D. . g. Passing an examination in these subjects. (Students should contact the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies, 256 Administration, for further information about the examination.) UCI Requirements 3. Credit for 180 quarter units, earned by examination, by other evaluation, or course work. A course normally offers four quarter units of credit. 4. A grade average of at least C (2.0). 5. Candidates for the baccalaureate must attain at least a C (2.0) average in all of the courses required in the major pro\u00ad gram and at least a C (2.0) average in the upper-division courses required in the major program. Higher averages than this may be required only in honors programs. Students who fail to attain a C (2.0) average in courses required in the major program may, at the option of the major unit, be denied the privilege of pursuing a major program in that unit. (In this context, \"the courses required in the major program\" are defined as the courses required for the major and offered by the program of the student's major.) 6. Credit for the last 36 units immediately preceding gradua\u00ad tion must be earned in residence at the Irvine campus. Excep\u00ad tions to this rule may be allowed, with prior departmental approval, to students enrolled in the Education Abroad Program. 7. Students enrolled at UCI from their freshman year may elect to meet as graduation requirements (UC, UCI, school, and major requirements) those in effect at the time of entrance or those subsequently passed after entrance. Stu\u00ad dents transferring from other collegiate institutions may elect to meet as graduation requirements those in effect at the time of transfer to UCI, those subsequently passed, or those in effect at the time of entering their other collegiate institution, provided that the date of entrance at the previous institution is not more than four years prior to the time of UC IRVINE - 1987-1988transfer to UCI. Students who transfer from a four-year institution and who have completed the general breadth requirements of that college, upon approval of petition, will be considered to have met the total breadth requirement of UCI except for the upper-division writing requirement. Stu\u00ad dents who transfer from a community college and who have met the general breadth requirement of any UC campus prior to transfer also will be regarded as having met the breadth requirement except for the upper-division writing requirement. A student who seeks readmission to UCI more than three consecutive quarters after withdrawing from stu\u00ad dent status must adhere to the graduation requirements in effect at the time of readmission or those subsequently passed. Breadth Requirement 8. Candidates for the bachelor's degree must satisfy the UCI breadth requirement. The requirement is designed to ensure that UCI graduates will have been exposed to a broad spec\u00ad trum of fundamental areas of intellectual experience. It is a graduation requirement and therefore need not be satisfied during only the lower-division years. To satisfy the breadth requirement, three courses, normally four units each, are required in each of the following areas: I. Writing II. Natural Sciences III. Social and Behavioral Sciences IV. Humanistic Inquiry V. Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, or Computer Science The specific course combinations in each area which may be used by students to satisfy the requirement are listed below. A number of the courses are available in more than one aca\u00ad demic unit. Students should refer to the actual descriptions of the courses to determine which are cross-listed. These cou~se combinations were selected to ensure the following: (I) that students, in meeting the requirement, be exposed to subject matter, problems, and techniques which would serve as a first introduction to an academic area and (2) that in meeting the requirement students be exposed to a connected set of courses which provide a coherent experience in that academic area. Only with respect to the lower-division writing requirement is it strongly recommended to pass the first two writing courses (English and Comparative Literature WR39B and WR39C or Humanities IB and IC*) sometime before the student's junior year. It is, of course, a good idea to begin satisfying the breadth requirement as early as possible, as many upper-division courses have as prerequisites courses that may be used to satisfy the breadth requirement. NOTE: In satisfying the breadth requirement, a student may count toward breadth no more than three courses taken within the disci\u00ad pline of the majo~. For example, a student majoring in Philosophy may count no more than three Philosophy courses toward breadth. I. Writing Requirement. Because of the importance of writ\u00ad ing in every academic discipline, the University is committed to developing the verbal skills of its students at all levels and in all areas. The Writing Requirement expresses this com\u00ad mitment, but the concern for and attention to clear, accurate writing is expected of faculty and students in all courses. The Writing Requirement consists of three courses beyond the Subject A Requirement. Except where otherwise noted *The University's Subject A requirement must be met before any part of Humanities IA-B-C (the Humanities Core Course) may be used to satisfy the lower-division writing requirement. Requirements for a Bachelor's Degree/Breadth 49 Greek Week festivities are sponsored by UC/'s 21 national fraternity and sorority chapters. below, students must satisfy the Subject A Requirement prior to fulfilling the Writing Requirement. Two of the three courses required must be lower-division courses and normally must be completed prior to the junior year (or in the case of transfer students within the first year of residency). The third course must be an upper-division course, and it must be taken only after the successful comple\u00ad tion of 84 quarter units (achievement of junior status) and completion of the lower-division requirement. Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-division and upper-division writing requirements. Lower-Division Requirement: The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. Students may select from the courses specified below: 1. English and Comparative Literature WR39B (Expository Writing) and English and Comparative Literature WR39C (Argument and Research) or any two quarters of the writing component of Humanities IA-B-C (the Humanities Core Course). 2. Humanities 15-16 (Humanities Writing Sequence) taken in conjunction with associated courses. For 1987-88 the asso\u00ad ciated courses are History 29A-B-C and History SOA-B-C. 3. Two quarters of the writi11g component of the Humanities Core Course (Humanities lA-B-C). (NOTE: Students held for Subject A will be required to enroll concurrently in the Writing Workshop during the first quarter. Successful com\u00ad pletion of the Writing Workshop will satisfy the Subject A requirement. For these students, the lower-division writing requirement may be satisfied only in the second and third quarters of the Humanities Core Course.) 4. Students who complete English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture WR39B or Humanities IS with a grade of B (3.0) or bet\u00ad ter may substitute as the second course of the lower-division Writing Requirement one of the following courses in creative writing, nonfiction, or journalism: English and Comparative Literature WR30, WR31, WR32, or WR38. Upper-Division Requirement: The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade UC IRVINE - 1987-198850 Breadth/Enrollment and Other Procedures of C (2.0) or better. The requirement may be satisfied by completing any one of the following: I. English and Comparative Literature WRI39. 2. An upper-division course in creative writing, nonfiction, or journalism. Such courses frequently have special prerequi\u00ad sites. Students may not use such a course to satisfy the requirement unless they have attained a B or better in both courses taken to satisfy the lower-division Writing Requirement. 3. An upper-division course designated in the quarterly Schedule of Classes as approved for satisfaction of the require\u00ad ment. Note: All courses approved to fulfill the upper-division writing requirement should be numbered \"I39\" or have a \"W\" suffix. The list of approved courses appears in the quar\u00ad terly Schedule of Classes. Students are encouraged to consult the Schedule of Classes or their advisor to determine the cur\u00ad rent upper-division writing requirement course offerings. If a course on the approved list is offered without the \"W\" suffix, it does not satisfy the upper-division writing requirement. 4. By examination (refer to the quarterly Schedule of Classes). Students who fail to attain the required grades in the courses taken in fulfillment of the Writing Requirement should refer to page 60 for further information. II. Natural Sciences. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Biological Sciences: Students may select any three courses from. Biological Sciences IA, IB, IC, ID, IE, IF, 79, 80, 8I. Chemistry: Chemistry and ILA-LB-LC. Physics: courses from 20A-B-C-D; I7 A-B plus one course from Physics IO, I6, or 20A-B-C-D. Social Ecology: Social Ecology E3, E4, ES. III. Social and Behavioral Sciences. Students must select three courses from one of the following areas, or two courses from one area plus a third from another area. The first course taken in any area must be an introductory course numbered I-I2, or, in the case of Comparative Culture, 70A-B-C. . Anthropology: Social Sciences I, 2A-B-C. Comparative Culture: 70A-B-C. Economics: Social I8D. either 61P (if 268 has not been taken). Psychology: Social Ecology 59, 511, 520, 584, 586; Social Sci\u00ad ences 7, SOT, SIA, SSC, 6IA. Ecology IO, Humanistic Inquiry. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Arts: History Art either Russian 20-30-40; Spanish SOA-B-C. V. foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science. Students must select a three-course sequence from one of the following areas: Computer Science: ICS 2I, 22, 23. Foreign Languages: 2A-B-C; Spanish 2A-B-C. Linguistics: Linguistics SO and two courses from Linguistics 110 or Social Sciences I4IH, Linguistics 120, or Social Sci\u00ad ences SOA; Social Sciences I3; 6A-B\u00ad Social Ecology I66; Social Sciences 11A-B-C, IOOA-B-C. When a breadth requirement course is cross-listed with another course, that course also is available for fulfillment of the breadth requirement. All students planning to transfer to UCI should see page 46 for details on fulfilling the UCI breadth requirement. School and Departmental Requirements In addition to the University requirements listed above, each undergraduate student must satisfy the degree requirements for the major and, if applicable, the minor or concentration selected. UCI, school, and departmental or major and minor requirements may overlap; courses taken to fulfill a school or departmental requirement (e.g., the physics course require\u00ad ment in the School of Biological Sciences) may also help fulfill the UCI breadth requirement. Some restrictions exist. Stu\u00ad dents are urged to make sure that they understand how many courses are permitted to satisfy more than one requirement. Information on specific degree requirements, as well as courses offered, can be found elsewhere in this Catalogue. Students should have declared a major no later than the beginning of their junior year, having made certain that the background and the preparation prerequisite to junior and senior work in the major have been accomplished. New and continuing undergraduate students should read the section on Academic Advising for Planning an Undergraduate Pro\u00ad gram; transfer students should also read the section on Plan\u00ad ning for Transfer to UCI. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. Enrollment and Other Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both under\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning enrollment and academic policies applying only to graduate students is given in the Graduate Studies and Research section. Enrollment and Payment of Fees To receive academic credit for regular courses and other supervised instruction or research, a student must be offi\u00ad cially enrolled prior to undertaking such activities. Enroll- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988ment does not become official until all required fees have been paid, and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition has been completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollments as indicated on the Class Verification and Identification Card are correct. Registration materials are available from the Registrar's Office approximately six weeks before the beginning of each quarter. The most important form in the registration mate\u00ad rials is the Enrollment in Classes Petition. It should be filled out carefully, according to the instructions in the Schedule of Classes. A quarterly calendar of dates for submission of en\u00ad rollment materials and payment of fees is included in each quarterly Schedule of Classes. The Schedule of Classes book\u00ad let may be purchased at the University Bookstore approxi\u00ad mately six weeks prior to the beginning of each quarter. The general procedures for enrollment are: 1. Consult the appropriate academic advisor to develop an approved program of study. Secure necessary signatures on the Enrollment in Classes Petition for courses that require special approval. New undergraduate students entering in the fall should seriously consider attending one of the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) sessions during the summer for academic advising and enrollment assistance. 2. Pay careful attention to deadlines and submit the com\u00ad pleted class enrollment and updated student information forms to the Registrar. 3. Pay required fees to the Cashier. Any other outstanding obligations must be satisfied at this time also. Class Verification and Identification Card After payment of fees and submission of enrollment mate\u00ad rials, a Class Verification and Identification Card is available for each student. The Card lists the courses in which a stu\u00ad dent is enrolled. If any courses requested could not be sched\u00ad uled, they are listed also, with the reason why the student is not enrolled in the course. Changes to course enrollments after receipt of the Card are handled through Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Cards, available from the stu\u00ad dent's academic dean's office or the Registrar. New undergraduate students are required to call in person at their academic deans' offices to secure their Class Verification and Identification Cards and obtain advice concerning their academic programs. Continuing undergraduate students and graduate students should consult the quarterly Schedule of Classes for instruc\u00ad tions on where to secure their cards. The Class Verification and Identification Card is certification of the student's class enrollment and is evidence that the stu\u00ad dent is registered at UCI and is entitled to Library privileges. In addition, the Card provides identification for Associated Students functions. If the Card is lost, there is a $3 replace\u00ad ment charge. Inquiries regarding the replacement of lost cards should be directed to the Registrar's Office. Late Enrollment and Payment of Fees Students who do not submit an Enrollment in Classes Peti\u00ad tion to the Registrar's Office during the published period are subject to a late service fee. The late service fee is graduated. Between the deadline and the end of the second week of classes, the late service fee is $25. Thereafter it increases to $50. Students who do not pay all required fees to the Cashier's Office during the published period for fee payment are sub-Enrollment and Other Procedures 51 ject to a late service fee. This fee is also graduated: $25 through the end of the second week of classes; $50 thereafter. The student is subject to both late service fees (either $50 or $100) if fees are not paid to the Cashier's Office and the En\u00ad rollment in Classes Petition is not returned to the Registrar's Office by the deadlines, which are published quarterly in the Schedule of Classes. To avoid the expense and inconvenience of late enrollment, students are urged to enroll and pay fees well before the pub\u00ad lished deadlines. Students with financial need should make advance arrangements with the Financial Aid Office, or another source, to have funds available when fees are due. The Registrar does not have authority to allow a student to pay fees after the deadline date or to waive the late fees, except in unusual cases where the University is responsible for the late transaction. A student who is allowed to apply late and, as a result, must pay fees and enroll late, is required to pay late service fees. Change of Class Enrollment After official enrollment materials have been filed with the Registrar, a student may add or drop courses, change sections of a course, or change the grading option by completing an Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, available from the student's academic dean's office. There is a $3 ser\u00ad vice charge for all add, drop, or change transactions received in the Registrar's Office after the second week of classes. An undergraduate student may not enroll in more than 20 units (excluding Physical Education) nor fewer than 12 units of course work during a given quarter without the permis\u00ad sion of the student's academic dean. Changes to Pass/Not Pass grading must not cause the student to exceed the limita\u00ad tions to Pass/Not Pass enrollment. Graduate students may not enroll in more than 16 or fewer than eight units of graduate or upper-division credit without ~rior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. During the first six weeks of each quarter, a student may add classes provided approval to add each class is granted by the instructor in charge. To add a class, a student must obtain the instructor's signature of approval on an Add card, carefully complete the Add card, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the sixth week of instruction. The dated signature of the instructor is always required and is valid for 10 working days. To drop a class or change the grading option during the first two weeks of the quarter, a student must obtain the signa\u00ad ture of the instructor in charge as evidence of notification on a Drop or Change of Grading Option Card and submit the card to the Registrar's Office no later than the end of the second week of instruction. Students may drop classes from the third through the sixth week of a quarter, inclusive, only with the permission of the instructor in charge. A student wishing to drop a class during this period must obtain the signature of approval from the instructor in charge on a Drop card, pay $3 at the Cashier's Office, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office. After the sixth week of a quarter, students may drop a course only with the permission of the instructor and the student's academic dean. Permission to drop after the sixth week can be granted only if the student is not failing the course and not subject to disqualification, and only if drop\u00ad ping the course would be to the educational benefit of the student, of the class as a whole, or both. To drop a class after UC IRVINE - 1987-198852 Enrollment and Other Procedures the sixth week, a student must complete a Drop card, obtain the instructor's and the dean's signatures of approval, pay $3 at the Cashier's Office, and submit the card to the Registrar's Office. Graduate students must have the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research to drop a course after the sixth week. A W notation will be recorded for each course dropped after the end of the sixth week of classes. The effective date of a \"drop\" is the date the approved Drop card is received in the Registrar's Office. Every student enrolled in a laboratory course in which equip\u00ad ment is issued is responsible for the equipment when drop\u00ad ping a course and will not be permitted to drop until the equipment is accounted for. Students are responsible for their official enrollment and must be officially enrolled in each class for which they expect credit. They must officially drop classes they have ceased attending. The student cannot simply discontinue attendance in a class; a Drop card must be filed before the last day of instruction for the quarter. Students are urged to verify their official enrollment early in the quarter. Students enrolling for the next quarter will find this information included with en\u00ad rollment materials for the next quarter. Those students not enrolling for the next quarter can verify their official enroll\u00ad ment by inquiring at the Registrar's Office. The Registrar's Office cannot accept Add, Drop, or Change cards after the last day of instruction of a particular quarter. Lapse of Status A student's status may lapse for the following reasons: Failure to pay required student fees by the prescribed dead\u00ad line; failure to respond to official notices; failure to settle financial obligations when due or to make satisfactory arran\u00ad gements with the Cashier's Office; failure to complete the physical examination; or failure to comply with admission conditions. Each student who becomes subject to lapse of status action is given advance notice and ample time to deal with the situa\u00ad tion. However, if the student fails to respond, action will be taken without further notice. A \"hold\" will be placed on all of the student's records and the student will be entitled to no \\further services of the University except assistance toward clearing the hold. A student must satisfy the conditions which caused the lapse of status before the hold can be cleared. Retention of Student Records The Registrar's Office maintains a permanent record of aca\u00ad demic work completed by each student. Support documents for the academic record are kept for one year. Students are strongly advised to carefully check their aca\u00ad demic record quarterly. (Student grade reports are available at the Registrar's Office shortly after the close of each quar\u00ad ter.) Discrepancies in the academic record should be reported to the Registrar immediately. After one year, it is assumed that the student accepts the accuracy of their academic record, and supporting source documents are destroyed. When the degree has been certified by the student's dean, a student's academic record may not be altered except in those cases where a procedural or clerical error on the part of the instructor has occurred. Transcript of Records The transcript of a student's academic records will be released only upon receipt of a signed request of the student authorizing the release. Application may be made in person or by mail; telephoned requests cannot be honored because payment is due in advance. Application for a transcript should be submitted to the Cashier's Office with a check or money order payable to Regents-UC for the exact amount due. The fee for transcripts is $3 for the first copy and $1 for each additional copy ordered and mailed at the same time. All outstanding debts to the University (with the exception of long-term financial aid loans not yet due and payable) must be paid in full before a transcript will be released. Requests for transcripts by other than the student whose transcript is being sought can be honored only (I) if the request is accompanied by a written authorization signed by the student whose transcript is sought, and (2) upon approval of the Registrar. Such transcripts can be released by the Registrar only to another college, university, or educationally related agencies such as the Law School Data Admissions Service (LSDAS) or the American Medical College Applica\u00ad tion Service (AMCAS). Such transcripts cannot be released to the person making the request in the student's stead. When a student orders a transcript to be sent to another col\u00ad lege, university, or agency, it is extremely important for the student to provide a complete, accurate mailing address to ensure delivery to the correct office. At least two weeks should be allowed for a transcript to be received by another institution or agency. Verification of Student Status. There is a $3 fee for each verification of student status performed by the Registrar's Office either at the window or by mail. Needs for which such verifications are performed include reference checks, bank loans, applications for good-student-driver insurance rates, and Social Security payments. Diplomas Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is about four months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Students may then call in person at the Registrar's Office or authorize the Registrar to deliver their diplomas by certified mail, or registered air mail to loca\u00ad tions outside the United States. There is a service charge of $5 for certified mail, $6 for registered air mail, payable to Regents-UC. All outstanding debts due to the University, with the exception of long-term financial aid loans, must be paid in full before a student's diploma will be released. See Commencement, pages 53 and 66. Withdrawal Prior to Start of Instruction A student who pays fees for a regular academic quarter and then decides to leave the University prior to the first day of classes must submit a notice of withdrawal, with the identifi\u00ad cation card attached, to the appropriate dean's office. With the exception of new undergraduate students, there is a $10 service charge for withdrawal prior to the first day of classes. Withdrawal After the Start of Instruction After classes begin for a regular academic quarter, an enrolled student who decides to leave the University before the end of that quarter must submit an official notice of withdrawal. A student who fails to submit a notice of with\u00ad drawal may accrue failing grades and also may severely jeopardize their academic standing at the University and adversely affect their future readmission to the University or admission to another university or college. Undergraduate students must submit the notice signed by their dean, with the identification card attached, to the Ombudsman. Graduate students must submit the notice to the Dean of Graduate Studies, and students in the College of Medicine must submit it to the College of Medicine Director UC IRVINE - 1987-1988of Admissions and Records. In extenuating circumstances, such as illness or emergency, the student should notify the appropriate dean or office as soon as possible in order to initiate withdrawal procedures. The effective date of the withdrawal will be determined by the Ombudsman, for undergraduate students, or by the Dean of Graduate Studies, for graduate students. A W notation will be recorded for each course in which en\u00ad rollment is withdrawn if the student's effective date of with\u00ad drawal is after the end of the sixth week of classes. A graduate student in good academic standing who wishes to withdraw and intends to return within one year may submit both the notice of withdrawal and an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Further informa\u00ad tion about leaves of absence appears in the Research and Graduate Studies section. If a student plans to leave the University after completing all academic work for the latest quarter of enrollment and has not paid fees for the next quarter, a formal notice of with\u00ad drawal is not necessary. See pages 28-29 for information on fee refunds. Readmission: Undergraduate Students Students are strongly urged to consider the policy below in formulating plans for leaving or returning to UCI. Every effort will be made to readmit UCI students who were in good academic standing at the time they ceased attending and who have filed readmission applications. Readmission is not automatic. A student must file an Applica\u00ad tion for Readmission with the Registrar's Office at least eight weeks prior to the quarter in which readmission is desired and pay a nonrefundable $35 Application Fee at the Cashier's Office. If a student has been academically disqualified from the Uni\u00ad versity or has left the University while on probation or sub\u00ad ject to disqualification, the student must apply for readmis\u00ad sion in the manner prescribed above. The application, how\u00ad ever, will be forwarded to the dean of the school which the student hopes to enter. If the dean decides that the student is serious about academic life, and/or that the student has dis\u00ad played capability at another academic institution, the student will most likely be allowed readmission to the University. Transcripts for work taken at other institutions must be submitted as part of the application. A nonrefundable fee of $35 is charged for each Application for Readmission. Remit\u00ad tance by bank draft or money order payable to Regents-UC must be attached to the application. Readmission: Graduate Students A graduate student who withdraws and has not been granted a leave of absence approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies can resume graduate study only if readmitted. The Applica\u00ad tion for Readmission must be submitted by the published deadline for graduate admission applications. Please refer to the statement on readmission which appears in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Intercampus Transfer: Undergraduates Only An undergraduate student in good standing may transfer from the UCI campus to another campus of the University of California. To do so, the student should first check with the UCI Registrar to see which of the campuses is accepting transfers and which majors are being encouraged by each campus. The student then obtains an Undergraduate Applica-Enrollment and Other Procedures 53 A flower shop is one of the many services available at .the University Center. tion packet from the UCI Registrar's Office and files the application by the deadline prescribed for the quarter in which the student wishes to transfer. (This application is the same as that used by new applicants to the University of California. It is important to indicate on the application where requested that the student's current enrollment is a UC campus.) The filing periods for the Undergraduate Appli\u00ad cation are: quarter-November 1-30. (UC Berkeley is on the semester system and has filing periods as follows: spring semester-July 1-31; fall semester-November 1-30.) After these dates, applications are accepted only until quotas are filled. A student may apply to as many other University of California campuses as desired in any given quarter. Pay\u00ad ment of a nonrefundable fee is required for all intercampus transfer requests filed. The fee is based on the number of campuses to which the student applies. Intercampus Visitor: Undergraduates Only A currently registered UCI undergraduate student in good standing may apply for intercampus visitor status at another campus of the University for one quarter. Forms and instruc\u00ad tions are available at the Registrar's Office. California Residence All inquiries with regard to the requirements for the estab\u00ad lishment of California residence (including exceptions per\u00ad taining to minors, aliens, and dependents of military person\u00ad nel stationed in California) should be directed to the Resi\u00ad dence Deputy, Registrar's Office, 215 Administration Build\u00ad ing, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717, (714) 856-6129 or the Office of the Legal Analyst-Residence Matters, 590 University Hall, University of California, Berke\u00ad ley, California 94720, (415) 642-2822. Please refer to the Fees section for information on the Nonresident Tuition Fee and California residence. Commencement Students who graduate any quarter of the academic year may participate in the year-end graduation ceremony. Com\u00ad mencement protocol information is mailed to all prospective graduates in late spring and also is available in the office of each academic counselor. See Diplomas, page 52. Application for Graduation In order to receive a degree, an undergraduate student should file an Application for Graduation at the appropriate dean's office, preferably during the first quarter of the senior year, but no less than six months before the expected day of graduation. UC IRVINE - 1987-198854 Orientation/Publications Orientation, Major Campus Publications, and Supplementary Educational Programs Orientation Orientation programs include Academic Advising and Orien\u00ad tation Week, held in the fall; the Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP), a 36-hour live-in experience on campus for new students and their parents; and Uni-Prep, a week-long, intensive program in September to help new students develop increased social and intellectual skills. All of these programs are sponsored by the Student Support Services Office, located in 201 and 209 Administration Building, (714) 856-7759. Academic Advising and Orientation Week, commonly known as \"0-Week,'' offers academic and social activities for new and returning students and is scheduled the week prior to the beginning of fall quarter classes. Students who enroll later in the academic year (winter or spring quarter) partici\u00ad pate in an abbreviated, half-day orientation prior to the beginning of the appropriate quarter. The Student-Parent Orientation Program (SPOP) is com\u00ad prised of three different sessions held on weekends during the summer. SPOP is designed to help new students with their registration materials and offers informative sessions on academic programs, extracurricular activities, housing choices, and much more. Participants and their parents live in residence halls for the weekend program. There is a fee for the program that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall quarter will be sent information about SPOP in the spring. Uni-Prep is a five-day program for entering students held in early September. Participants live in the residence halls and attend workshops and other activities designed to provide them with information about shaping their academic and personal lives at UCI. A fee is charged that covers room, board, and program costs. Applicants for admission who plan to enroll at UCI in fall quarter will be sent information about Uni-Prep in the spring. Major Campus Publications Several major publications available on campus provide information about academic programs, student activities and services, enrollment in classes, and specifics pertaining to the individual departments and schools. Some of these publica\u00ad tions are described here; others are mentioned in Antidote (the student handbook). The UCI General Catalogue The UCI General Catalogue contains general administrative and academic information, as well as specific descriptions of schools and departments and the courses they offer, degree requirements, major requirements, the UCI breadth require\u00ad ment, and various academic policies and procedures. It is available beginning in mid-July from the University Book\u00ad store and University Extension; copie\u00b7s are $4.50 if purchased on campus (see page 00 for prices of mailed copies). Because the Catalogue must be prepared well in advance of the aca\u00ad demic year it covers, changes in some programs inevitably will occur. Current information on specific courses offered in any one quarter is available in the Schedule of Classes and in quarterly information published by some of the academic units. Schedule of Classes The Schedule of Classes contains updated information on fees, how to enroll in classes, and final examination schedules. Most importantly, it lists all classes to be offered that quarter and the time, room, and instructor scheduled for each. If there are any enrollment restrictions on the class, such as consent of instructor required, these are noted. Just prior to the first day of instruction for each quarter, the Registrar's Office issues an addendum to the Schedule that lists added and canceled classes, changes in time, instructor, or class\u00ad room assignments, and other such information. Because the Schedule is published several times each aca\u00ad demic year, it also is a timely source of information on new policies and procedures, or changes in fees or procedures, that could not be included in the Catalogue because of the latter's less frequent publication schedule. Except for the fall edition, the Schedule of Classes is published just before the beginning of each quarter; the fall Schedule is available in mid-spring for the convenience of students already attending UCI who will be continuing at UCI in the fall. The Schedule is distributed to new students when Regis\u00ad tration Packets are mailed and also is available for purchase from the University Bookstore for 30\u00a2. Departmental and School Announcements These publications contain the most up-to-date information available regarding a wide assortment of academic informa\u00ad tion of immediate, timely interest to students, and all stu\u00ad dents are strongly urged to read them. The publications come in various forms, from' brochures of several pages to one\u00ad sheet photocopied announcements, and contain information specific to the individual academic unit. These publications usually are posted on departmental bulletin boards, are avail\u00ad able in academic counselors' offices, or can be obtained from departmental offices. Antidote Antidote is the student handbook, published in the fall and available (at no cost) beginning Academic Advising and Orientation Week (\"0\" Week) while supplies last. Antidote is meant to be a handy resource guide on clubs, activities, and procedures. Arranged alphabetically, Antidote contains a broad spectrum of information for students, ranging from how to obtain a leave of absence to jobs to Third World and minority student activities to \"Zot.\" Its Quick Cure Index directs readers to answers not only in Antidote but also to room and telephone numbers of campus offices that can pro\u00ad vide additional information. Student-Produced Media The New University is a weekly campus newspaper published by UCI students. Other student-produced media include East\u00ad West Ties, The Phoenix, La Voz Metiza, Tapestry, and The Blade. In addition, UCI students operate a radio station, KUCI (88.9 FM). UCI Journal The UCI journal is published bimonthly during the academic year by the University Advancement Office and the UCI Alumni Association. The Journal contains feature stories, commentaries, and other timely reports on UCI research, events, student life, educational policy, and alumni activities as well as a calendar of events on campus. With a circulation of 60,000, the Journal is the only general-interest publication of UCI that serves members of the UCI community both on and off campus. Copies may be obtained by mail or from UC IRVINE - 1987-1988media distribution boxes on campus. Further information may be obtained by telephoning(714) 856-6923. UCitems UCitems is the campus newsletter and events calendar pub\u00ad lished by the University Advancement Office biweekly dur\u00ad ing the academic year. UCitems reports on University and campus policies, accomplishments, and activities as they relate to faculty, students, and staff. Copies are available in media distribution boxes in the Administration Building, Library, classroom buildings, residence halls, and cafeterias. Further information may be obtained by telephoning (714) 856-6922. Publications on Campus Services and Activities Many campus offices that provide services or activities have brochures available describing what they offer. Many of the activities and events mentioned are available to the off\u00ad campus community. Publications include, but are not limited to, those about the services available at the Career Planning and Placement Center, the quarterly announcement of arts and lectures events (UCI Presents), and the Cooperative Out- door Program quarterly. \u00b7 Supplementary. Educational Programs Summer Sessions Several summer sessions are held on the Irvine campus. Ses\u00ad sion I is scheduled from June 27 through August 3, 1988. Session II is from August 8 through September 14, 1988. An overlapping 10-week session extends from June 27 through September 5, 1988. Several special sessions are also held, including one for graduate students engaged in research and independent study. Those who enroll in these sessions and take. an academic program equivalent to a regular quarter may accelerate their progress toward a degree. A wide variety of courses from the regular sessions is planned, supplemented by experimental offerings available only during the summer. Admission is open to all university students, to high school graduates, to qualified applicants over 18 years of age, and to qualified high school students who have completed their junior year. Admission to Summer Session does noi: constitute admission to a regular session of the University; therefore, official transcripts of educational records are not required. Fees for Summer Session are the same for out-of-State students as for California students. Information regarding Summe\u00b7r Session may be obtained from the Summer Session Office in the University Extension Building, (714) 856-5493. Application forms and course list\u00ad ings are available i11 March. \u00b7 University Extension University Extension is the unit through which UCI serves the continuing education needs of adults. Extension provides advanced learning opportunities to college-educated and pro\u00ad fessional people through more than one thousand credit and noncredit courses, seminars, workshops, conferences, lecture series, and certificate programs. Courses and certificate programs are offered in a wide range of fields, including microcomputer engineering, hazardous materials management, interior design, legal assistantship, construction management, real estate, executive education, contract management, alcohol and drug counseling, person\u00ad nel management, marketing communications, financial plan\u00ad ning, software systems technology, computers in education, Publications/Supplementary Programs 55 land use and development planning, and State-approved credential programs for educators. University Extension also provides a means by which com\u00ad munity members who are not officially matriculated UCI students may pursue academic interests by participating in a limited number of regular UCI courses. This method, which is called concurrent enrollment, is available only on a space\u00ad available basis with the approval of the course instructors. Applicants for concurrent enrollment must register through the University Extension Registration Office. Educational and career counseling for adults is available through the Career Counseling and Testing Program and through the Women's Opportunities Center. All University Extension programs are supported by fees charged to stu\u00ad dents. A free catalogue may be obtained from the University Extension Office, telephone (714) 856-5414. University Extension Program in English as a Second Language The Program in English as a Second Language (ESL}, spon\u00ad sored by University Extension, prepares international stu\u00ad dents to enter and pursue their educational objectives in U.S. colleges and universities. An intensive program in English for academic purposes, it offers core courses in grammar, writ\u00ad ing, reading and vocabulary development, seminar reporting and discussion strategies, listening, note-taking, debate and public speaking, and writing the research paper. A variety of elective courses such as TOEFL and GMAT preparation, American history, business and computer English are also available. Requests for information should be addressed to Program in English as a Second Language, University of Cali\u00ad fornia Extension, P.O. Box (714) 856-5991. Another ESL program is available to students who have been admitted to UCI. Students should refer to pages 39 and 158. ROTC Although actual ROTC courses are not taught on the Irvine campus, a cross-town agreement allows qualified UCI stu\u00ad dents to participate in either the Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) or Navy/Marine Corps Officer Training (NROTC) program. A brief descriptive pamphlet summarizing the programs is available from the Admissions Office, 245 Administration Building. Air Force ROTC Through arrangements with California State University, Long Beach; Loyola Marymount University; the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA); and the University of Southern California, two-, and four-year Air Force Reserve Officers Training Corps (AFROTC) programs are available to all qualified UC Irvine students. Academic units earned in this program are counted as elective units toward fulfillment of UCI graduation requirements. Successful completion of the AFROTC program leads to a commission as an officer in the Air Force. Two-, 2llz-, 3-, and 3llz1year scholarships are available to qualified students on a competitive basis. Four\u00ad year scholarships for incoming students must be applied for before December 1 in the year prior to entering college. All scholarship recipients receive full tuition (UC Educational and Registration Fees), required fees and $88 per quarter for books, and a stipend of $100 per month. Students on scholar\u00ad ship in the first two years of the program must successfully complete a course in English composition within two aca\u00ad demic years from scholarship activatiof1.. Students in the last two years of the program must successfully complete a UC IRVINE - 1987-198856 Supplementary Programs/Education Abroad course in mathematical reasoning prior to commissioning. Students who accept a scholarship must agree to successfully complete at least two terms of college instructiqn in a major Indo-European language prior to commissioning. Navy ROTC Through arrangements with the Naval Science Department of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), quali\u00ad fied UCI students may enroll in the NROTC Program at UCLA. Successful completion of this prpgram leads to a Commission as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy or as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps. Academic classes com\u00ad pleted as part of the NROTC Program can be transferred and counted as elective units toward graduation at UCI. Qualified students may apply for NROTC competitive scholarships which provide tuition and fee payment at UCI, payment for books, and a stipend of $100 per month. Applications for NROTC enrollment are accepted during a student's fresh\u00ad man year and until March 15 of the sophomore year. For more information, students should contact the Naval Science Department (NROTC Unit), University of California, Los Angeles; Los Angeles, CA 90024 or telephone (213) 825-9075. Education Abroad Program The Education Abroad Program (EAP) of the University of California offers upper-division students the opportunity to experience a different culture while making progress toward degree objectives. This overseas study program operates in cooperation with more than 65 host universities and colleges in 29 countries throughout the world. Admission of University of California undergraduate stu\u00ad dents is subject to the following qualifications: a minimum 3.0 cumulative grade point average at the time of application; junior standing by the end of the spring term; completion of two years of appropriate foreign language courses with an overall minimum grade point average of 3.0 by the end of the spring term; and support of the Campus EAP Selection Committee. Students interested in the language, literature, art, culture, history, government, or social institutions of the countries\u00b7 where EAP study centers are located have the opportunity to gain substantially from first-hand academic experience. In addition, whatever their field of study, EAP participants can broaden their outlook and gain new skills as the result of study in a foreign country. Study abroad allows students to experience vastly different cultures and contrasting patterns of thinking while making progress toward a UC degree. The cost of studying abroad through EAP is comparable to the cost of studying at UCI. EAP participants are responsible for UC registration and educational fees, campus fees, and room, board, books and personal expenses. The only addi\u00ad tional costs directly related to the Program are for round-trip transportation and vacation travel, and personal expenses beyond what normally would be spent at home. Most Uni\u00ad versity of California financial aid, including grants, scholar\u00ad ships, and loans, is available to students who qualify. Normally, students participate in EAP during their junior year, so generally application for EAP is made in the sopho\u00ad more year. However, students may apply for participation as fourth-or fifth-year seniors or as second-year graduate stu\u00ad dents. Students interested in EAP should contact the EAP Office early in the fall quarter concerning application dead\u00ad lines because of early deadlines for the United Kingdom and Ireland (early November). The deadline for Australia, Costa Rica (the year-long program), and New Zealand is May, and for most other countries is mid-January. Application forms are available in the EAP Office, located in Trailer 504, telephone (714) 856-6343. Shortly after the dead\u00ad line for receipt of applications, applicants will be interviewed by a UCI campus selection committee consisting of faculty and EAP returnees. The files of applicants selected by the UCI committee are then sent to the Universitywide EAP Office at the Santa Barbara campus for final selection. Academic Program Generally, EAP students attend courses taught by faculty of the host university in the language of the host country; thus, language skills are very important. The academic program includes (1) an intensive preparatory course in the language of the host country (this does not apply to programs in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, Egypt, Hungary, India, and Kenya, in which English is the primary language); (2) a full year of academic courses; and (3) oppor\u00ad tunity to audit courses within the host university. Students may go to Norway or Sweden with no prior knowledge of these languages, but must spend the summer in intensive language programs which prepare them in the language for the academic year. Students are expected to complete a min\u00ad imum of 36 units during the academic year in addition to units earned in the intensive language program. Although units and grade points earned through the EAP are incorporated into the participant's University transcript and grade point average, the academic unit in which the partici\u00ad pant's major is offered determines which EAP courses will be accepted in satisfaction of requirements for the specific major. A number of majors require that certain key upper\u00ad division courses be completed in residence at UCI. EAP participants who satisfy all degree requirements while abroad and who expect to graduate upon completion of their year abroad should file for candidacy to receive their degree in September because, unfortunately, transcripts from abroad take time to reach the home campus and are not received in time for EAP returnees to be included on the June degree list. Such returnees, however, may participate in June Commencement. Study Centers The courses and fields of study open to EAP participants vary at each center; each of the host institutions has special areas of excellence and strength. Detailed information about each center is available in descriptive brochures for each country. They are available from advisors in the EAP Office. Below is a list of countries and universities participating in the EAP: Australia: University of Melbourne, Monash University (Melbourne), LaTrobe University (Melbourne), The Austral\u00ad ian National University (Canberra), Macquarie University (Sydney), University of Sydney, University of New South Wales (Sydney) Austria: University of Vienna Brazil: University of Sao Paulo China: Peking University Costa Rica: The University of Costa Rica, San Jose Egypt: The American University of Cairo England: University of Birmingham, University of East Anglia, University of Exeter, University of Hull, University of Kent, University of Lancaster, University of Leeds, Uni\u00ad versity of Sussex, University College (London), University of York UC IRVINE - 1987-1988france: University of Bordeaux, University of Grenoble, Uni\u00ad Poitiers Germany: Georg-August University (Gottingen) Hong Kong: Chinese University of Hong Kong India: University of Delhi Ireland: University of Dublin (Trinity College) Israel: University of Haifa and Hebrew University (Jerusalem) Italy: University of Padua, Conservatorio Bisonte (Florence), International Christian University and Sophia Univer\u00ad sity (Tokyo) (Seoul) Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autonorna de Mexico New Zealand (under negotiation): The University of Auk\u00ad land, Lincoln College (Christchurch), University of Otago (Dunedin), Catolica (Lima) Portugal: University of Lisbon Scotland: University of St. Andrews, University of Stirling Sierra Leone, West Africa: Freetown Spain: University of Barcelona and University of Madrid Sweden: University of Lund Taiwan: National Chengchi University (Taipei) U.S.S.R.: Leningrad State University Wales: St. David's University College (Lampeter) and Univer\u00ad sity College of Wales (Aberystwyth) The programs listed above are for a full academic year.

Those selected for participation irt this program will spend nine weeks in Williamsburg, Virginia; one in Philadel\u00ad phia; and a concluding week in Washington, D.C. The pro\u00ad gram is open to all undergraduates from all campuses in the University of California system. With the prior approval of their graduate advisor, graduate students also may apply. Participants register for three courses through the Riverside Education Abroad/Academic Regulations and Procedures 57 campus' Department of History (History I57, I58, I59). Spe\u00ad cial arrangements for additional independent study (maxi\u00ad mum of four units) may be made with the student's home campus. Costs for housing, food, and transportation are the individual participant's responsibility. For further informa\u00ad tion, brochures, or application forms, please telephone (714) 787-3820. Preference is given to applications received by June 30; final application deadline is November I. Academic Regulations and Procedures Except where noted, all information applies to both undet\u00ad graduate and graduate students. Additional information con\u00ad cerning academic regulations applying only to graduate stu\u00ad dents is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Student Academic Records Student's official academic records are maintained perman\u00ad ently by the Registrar and are used for purposes such as aca\u00ad demic advising, scholarship awards, admission to professional or graduate schools, and future employment. Each student is responsible for carefully examining their en\u00ad rollment and academic records and may do so throughout the academic year. Students must promptly notify the Registrar's Office if they find a discrepancy in their records. Since all data entries for each student's current quarter class enrollment are put directly into the academic record system from source documents completed by the student, it is extremely important for each student to complete these source documents (e.g., Enrollment in Classes Petition and Add/Drop/Change cards) carefully and accurately. Student academic records may not be changed after one year or, in some cases, in less than one year if Academic Senate regulations specify a shorter time limit. For example, the notation \"NR,\" which means that no grade has been reported, must be removed within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or it will automatically be converted to the grade \"F\" or \"NP\" (under Senate Regulation IR 345). Grading System A -Excellent (4.0 grade points per unit) B -Good (3.0 grade points per unit) C -Average (2.0 grade points per unit) D -Lowest passing grade (I.O grade point per unit) F -Not passing (no grade points) I -Incomplete P -Pass (equal to grade Cor better) NP-Not Pass S -Satisfactory (equal to grade B or better; graduate stu\u00ad dents only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) U -Unsatisfactory (graduate students only in courses so designated by the Graduate Council) IP -In Progress (restricted to certain sequential courses, so designated by the Committee on Courses, for which the final quarter grade of a rnultiquarter sequence course is assigned to the previous quarter(s) of the sequence) NR-No Report (given when an instructor's final grade course report is not submitted or when the student's name was on the official class roster but the instructor did not report a grade for the student; NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subsequent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of UC IRVINE - 1987-198858 Academic Regulations and Procedures the degree, whichever comes first. The instructor, at the student's request, may replace an NR with a grade within one quarter of subsequent enrollment or may authorize the student to drop t.he class, which would result in the NR becoming a W). W -Withdrew. A W notation is recorded on a student's permanent record for each course a student drops after the end of the sixth week of instruction in a quarter. Courses in which a W has been entered on a student's record will be disregarded in determining the student's grade point average and will not be considered as courses attempted in assessing the student's satisfaction of the normal progress requirement. Plus suffixes may be attached to the grades B, C, and D; minus suffixes may be attached to the grades A, B, C, and D. Plus grades carry three-tenths grade point more per unit, and minus grades carry three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades. After each quarter, a copy of the student's permanent record is available from the Registrar's Office. On the copy, the stu\u00ad dent will find grades for all the quarters taken at UCI, a com\u00ad putation of grade point average at the University of Califor\u00ad nia, and a list of the University requirements completed (Sub\u00ad ject A, American History, and American Institutions). Requirements for a bachelor's degree include the accumula\u00ad tion of credit for 180 quarter units with an average of at least C (grade point average of at least 2.0). A course at UCI.nor\u00ad mally offers four quarter units of credit, and, in the following text, the term \"course\" may be understood to carry four units. The grade point average is the sum of all accumulated grade points (grade points earned in a course per unit limes the unit value of the course) divided by the sum of all units attempted. It should be noted that final grades as reported by professors at UCI are normally permanent and final. A professor may not change a final grade except to correct a clerical or pro\u00ad cedural error. Clerical or procedural errors should be cor\u00ad rected within one regular academic quarter after the grade is assigned. Under circumstances explained in the Academic Grievance Procedures (Manual of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate, Appendix II), a grade may be changed if the Academic Grievance Panel has determined that the grade was assigned on the basis of discrimination. Incomplete Grades An I or Incomplete grade is assigned to a student by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality but is incomplete because of circumstances beyond the student's control, and when the student has been excused by the instructor from completing the quarter's work. For currently enrolled students, the maximum time limit for making up an I grade is three quarters of enrollment. After this time the I grade can no longer be replaced and will appear permanently on the record. The student should con\u00ad sult the instructor to determine how the Incomplete may be made up. The instructor is not obligated to allow the maximum three-quarter period. It is strongly recommended that the stu\u00ad dent and the instructor prepare a written agreement specify\u00ad ing how the Incomplete can be made up and the deadline for doing so. Once the work is completed within a time agreed upon by the instructor, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade form to the office of the dean of the school in which the course was offered. The student should not reenroll in the course to make up the Incomplete. Students not currently enrolled at UCI have a maximum of one calendar year in which to replace an Incomplete. How-ever, iri exceptional individual cases involving the student's prolonged inability to pursue a course of study, extensions of up to two additional years may be granted by the instructor with the approval of the dean of the unit offering the course; students must petition for such an extension within one calendar year following the assignment of the Incomplete grade. Courses graded I carry no grade points and are not included in computation of the grade point average which appears on the student's permanent record. Any I grade will remain indefinitely on the permanent record unless the work is com\u00ad pleted and a grade assigned as described above. University of California regulations require a grade point average of 2.0 for all units allempted in order to receive a bachelor's degree. Only when a check for satisfaction of gradua\u00ad tion requirements is made are I's treated as F's. If the student's overall average is at least a 2.0, including the Incomplete grades computed as F's, then the student may graduate. If the Incomplete grades computed as F's decrease the student's average below a 2.0, the student may not graduate until enough I grades have been made up to bring the average up to a 2.0 and this must be done within the time limits specified above. Pass/Not Pass The Pass/Not Pass option is available at UCI to encourage students to enroll in courses outside their major field. Courses graded Pass or Not Pass are J:)Ot included in compu\u00ad tation of the grade point average which appears on a stu\u00ad dent's permanent recoqf. However, if a student receives a Pass in a class, course and unit credit for the class is received, except as provided below. If a Not Pass is received, the stu\u00ad dent receives no credit for the class. The use of Pass/Not Pass is governed by all of the following provisions: I. A student in good standing may take up to an average of four units per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, candidates for the bachelor's degree may take a total of 12 more units in courses designated by academic units as Pass/ Not Pass Only. 2. A student who earns a grade of C (2.0) or better will have a Pass/Not Pass grade recorded as Pass. If the student earns a grade of C-or below, the grade will be recorded as a Not Pass, and no unit credit will be received for the course. In both cases, the student's grade will not be computed into the grade point average. 3. Courses taken under the Pass/Not Pass option may count toward the 180-unit requirement for the bachelor's degree and toward the breadth requirement. With the exception of courses designated Pass/Not Pass Only, courses taken Pass/ Not Pass may not be used to satisfy specific course require\u00ad ments of the student's school and major, unless authorized by the appropriate dean. No more than two courses applied to a minor may be taken Pass/Not Pass. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program, may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree, and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. 4. Changes to or .from the Pass/Not Pass option must be . made during the enrollment period. No changes can be made after the first two weeks of classes without the approval of UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Academic Regulations and Procedures 59 Students may choose to attend a wide variety of events held on campus during the day, such as concerts, lectures by guest speakers, and cross-cultural activities. the dean of the student's school. No changes in the Pass/Not Pass option can be made after the last day of instruction. 5. A student on academic probation may not enroll in a course with the Pass/Not Pass option. (Physical Education courses are excepted.) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grades (Graduate Students Only) Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory grading, unlike Pass/Not Pass, is not a student option. With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research or other individual graduate work undertaken by a graduate student may be evaluated by means of the grades S or U. Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only. Also, the grade S or U may be assigned provisionally in each but the last quarter of a gradu\u00ad ate course extending over more than one quarter. Upon completion of the last quarter, letter grades (A to F) replace such provisional grades. When a grade of S or U has been assigned on a provisional basis and the student does not complete all quarters of the course sequence, the instructor may assign a final letter grade or the grade of I to replace the S or U, or let the grade of S or U stand as a final grade. With the specific approval of the Graduate Council, other graduate courses may be graded on an S/U basis provided that each student enrolled in such a course receives a grade of S, U, or I (or if an undergraduate student, a grade of P or NP). The grade S is defined as equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit will be allowed for work graded Unsatisfactory. Grades In Progress IP is a transcript notation, restricted to sequential courses which extend over two or more quarters, indicating that the final grade for the individual quarters will not be assigned until the last quarter of the sequence is completed. The grade for the final quarter is then assigned for all of the previous quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. IP notations may be given only for courses designated by the Academic Senate Commit\u00ad tee on Courses for use of this notation. IP notations are not included in computations of the student's grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grades Not Reported A student who receives an NR must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. An NR becomes an F or NP after one quarter of subse\u00ad quent enrollment or at the end of the quarter immediately preceding award of the degree, whichever comes first. NR transcript notations are not included in computations of the grade point average and do not contribute to the number of quarter units completed. Grade Points and Grade Point Average Grade points are assigned on a four point basis: A, 4 points per unit; B, 3 points per unit; C, 2 points per unit; D, I point per unit; F and I, zero points. Plus or minus suffixes modify the above by plus or minus 0.3 grade point per unit. UC IRVINE - 1987-198860 Academic Regulations and Procedures Each undergraduate course counts one through eight units, and graduate courses range from one to 12 units each (see departmental course descriptions). Grade point average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total number of grade points earned by the total value of courses attempted. P, NP, S, U, NR, IP, and I grades are excluded in computing grade point average. Removal of Deficient Grades Undergraduates may repeat courses only when grades of C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP were received. (A C-earned before fall quarter, 1984, is not repeatable.) Degree credit for courses so repeated will be given only once, but the grade assigned at each enrollment shall be permanently recorded. In computing the grade point average of an undergraduate with repeated courses in which a C-, D+, D, D-, F, or NP was received, only the most recently received grades and grade points shall be used for the first 16 units repeated. In case of further repeti\u00ad tions, the grade point average shall be based on all additional grades assigned and on total units attempted. All courses which were originally taken for a letter grade must be repeated for a letter grade. Courses originally taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis may be repeated for a Pass/Not Pass or for a letter grade if the course is so offered. A graduate student may repeat only once a course in which a grade below B or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade shall be used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades will be used. Satisfaction of the Writing Requirement Once a student matriculates to UCI, the student can take only UCI courses in satisfaction of the lower-and upper\u00ad division writing requirements. The two courses taken to fulfill the lower-division Writing requirement must be completed with a grade of Cor better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in the lower-division courses: 1. Students who fail to attain a grade of C in one or both courses of the English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C sequence must repeat the course or courses in question. 2. Students who fail to attain a C in Humanities 15 normally should enroll in English and Comparative Literature WR39B; students who fail to attain a C in Humanities 16 should nor\u00ad mally enroll in English and Comparative Literature WR39C. Alternatively, a student who fails to attain a C in either Humanities 15 or 16 may repeat these courses with the per\u00ad mission of a faculty advisor or academic counselor. 3. Students who fail to attain a C in at least two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core Course nor\u00ad mally should substitute English and Comparative Literature WR39C if they need one quarter of additional work to com\u00ad plete the requirement, or English and Comparative Literature WR39B-C if they need two quarters to complete the requirement. The course taken to fulfill the upper-division requirement must be completed with a grade of C or better. The following applies to students who fail to attain a grade of C or better in the upper-division course: Students who fail to attain a grade of C in English and Com\u00ad parative Literature WR139 should repeat it. Students follow\u00ad ing any other approved upper-division option should enroll in English and Comparative Literature WR139 if a C is not attained in the selected course. See page 49 for further information on the Writing require\u00ad ment portion of the breadth requirement. Credit by Examination An enrolled student may obtain credit for many courses by taking a special examination administered by a faculty member who normally teaches that course. Detailed proce\u00ad dures for obtaining credit by examination may be obtained from the office of the dean of the school which offers the course. Approval of any petition for credit by examination must be obtained from the dean of that school before the examination can be administered. After the dean has signed the petition, the student must have it validated by paying a $5 Credit by Examination Fee at the Cashier's Office. The instructor giving the examination retains the prerogative (1) to decide whether the course can be taken by examina\u00ad tion, (2) to determine the form such an examination may take, and (3) to stipulate whether the grade will be reported as Pass/Not Pass or as letter grades (e.g., A, B, C, etc.). A student may take the examination for a particular course only one time. After receiving the grade, the student may accept it or reject it. If the student is not satisfied with the grade received on the examination, the student may choose not to receive credit or a grade. If the student does choose to accept the results of the examination, grades and grade points will be entered on the record in the same manner as those for regular courses of instruction. Independent Study: Undergraduates Only Another class option is available primarily to upper-division stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The independent-study option allows the stu\u00ad dent to plan with the instructor a course having a clear rela\u00ad tionship to the student's academic program. The plan for the course will include a reading list, a group of assignments, examinations, papers, or similar evidence of intellectual achievement on which academic credit will be based. A de\u00ad scription of the course and of its requirements must be approved by the instructor responsible for it and by the department chair or dean. Independent-study credit for undergraduates is limited to five units per quarter. Final Examinations Final examinations are obligatory in all undergraduate courses except laboratory and studio courses, or their equiv\u00ad alent, as individually determined by the Committee on Courses. Normally each such examination shall be conducted in writing and must be completed by all participants by the announced time shown in the Schedule of Classes for the quarter in question. These examinations may not exceed three hours duration. In laboratory and studio courses, the department concerned may at its option require a final exam\u00b7 ination subject to prior announcement in the Schedule of Classes for the term. Final grade reports from professors are due in the Registrar's Office within 72 hours after the final examination. Undergraduate Scholarship Requirements Class Level Undergraduate students are classified as freshman, sopho\u00ad more, junior, or senior students, based on the total number of units acquired, as follows: Freshman 0 -40.4 Sophomore 40.5- 83.9 Junior 84.0-134.9 Senior 135.0 -180.0 UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Course Load Limits An undergraduate may enroll in as few as 12 units or as many as 20 units. To enroll for more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units a student must obtain the signature of the stu\u00ad dent's dean on the Enrollment in Classes Petition. Any action to add or drop courses after submission of the Enrollment in Classes Petition which will cause a student to be enrolled in more than 20 units or fewer than 12 units requires approval by the student's dean. This approval is certified by the dean's signature on the Add, Drop, or Change of Grading Option Card, as appropriate. Students in the part-time study program are referred to page 41. Academic Standing To remain in good academic standing a student must main\u00ad tain a grade point average of at least 2.0 and make progress toward the degree at a satisfactory rate. An undergraduate student normally is subject to academic probation if at the end of any quarter the grade point average for that quarter, or the cumulative grade point average, is less than 2.0. A student whose grade point average falls below a 1.5 for any quarter, or who after two consecutive quarters on proba\u00ad tion has not achieved a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 or a satisfactory rate of progress, is subject to disqualification. Normal Progress Requirement Regular undergraduate students will become subject to pro\u00ad bation or subject to disqualification from further registration in the University if they fail to make normal progress toward the baccalaureate degree. (A) Normal progress for all regular undergraduate students is defined in the following table, in terms of quarter units completed at the end of quarters enrolled. Quarter 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Normal Subject to Progress to Disqualification 7 15 23 39 55 71 88 105 123 141 159 (B) A student who at the end of a given quarter of enroll\u00ad ment has completed the number of units in the range speci\u00ad fied in the \"Normal Progress\" category under (A) is making normal progress. A student who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed a number of units in the range specified in the \"Subject to Probation\" category under (A) is subject to being placed on probation by the faculty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. A stu\u00ad dent who at the end of a given quarter of enrollment has completed no more than a number of units in the range spec\u00ad ified in the \"Subject to Disqualification\" category under (A) is subject to disqualification by the fac).llty of that student's school or program or its designated agent. (C) Students who have completed two consecutive quarters on academic probation without having achieved at the end of Academic Regulations and Procedures 61 that period at least the normal rate of progress specified under (A) are subject to disqualification. A student will be allowed to continue on probation only if the record indicates likely achievement of the required scholastic standing within a reasonable time. (D) For purposes of calculating \"Normal Progress,\" \"Subject to Probation,\" and \"Subject to Disqualification,\" students admitted to the University with advanced standing will be classified with respect to quarter of enrollment at entrance in accordance with the following table: Quarter at Advanced Standing Quarter Entrance Units at Entrance 1 0-14 2 15-29 3 30-44 4 45-59 8 105-119 9 120-134 10 135-149 (E) Units earned under the following three circumstances are not to be counted toward determination of the quarter at entrance under (D) above: (1) Advanced Placement Examina\u00ad tion; (2) College Level Examination Program; (3) concurrent enrollment in college courses while in high school. (F) The quarter of enrollment at entrance of students (including baccalaureate degree candidates who already hold a baccalaureate degree) seeking admission to the University with 150 or more advanced standing units will be determined by the faculty offering the curriculum in which such students seek to enroll. This determination will be made consistent with the program required for such students to obtain the desired degree and with University residence requirements. (G) The Normal Progress requirement described above is not to be confused with the Normal Academic Progress require\u00ad ment for Financial Aid. The former has to do with academic standing, the latter with receipt of financial aid. Probation is not a necessary step before disqualification. If a student becomes subject to disqualification, the complete record of grades and other accomplishments will be carefully reviewed by the responsible faculty authorities of the stu\u00ad dent's school. If the record indicates little probability that the student will be able to meet the academic standards of the University of California, the student will be disqualified from further enrollment. Each school and program is obliged by Academic Senate regulations to maintain a procedure under which a student may appeal probation and disqualification actions. In order to transfer from one campus to another in the Uni\u00b7 versity of California or from one UCI school to another, a student who has been disqualified or who is on academic probation must obtain the approval of the appropriate faculty, or its designated agent, into whose jurisdiction the student seeks to transfer. Honors Information about the specific honors programs offered in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, the Department of Information and Computer Science, and the Program in Social Ecology is found in the individual sections for these programs. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 62 Academic Regulations and Procedures/Academic Support Services Quarterly Undergraduate Honors Quarterly undergraduate honors are awarded in each school to students who achieve a quarterly grade point average of 3.5 or better in a minimum of 12 graded units. Honors at Graduation Students may graduate with honors, summa cum laude, magna cum laude, or cum laude. The criteria used by each school in selecting candidates for these honors are included in each school's section of the Catalogue. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Graduate Scholarship Requirements For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, B+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship. Information concerning graduate student course load requirements and satisfactory academic progress is given in the Research and Graduate Studies section. Enrollment in University Extension If a UCI student wishes to enroll in a University Extension course concurrently with enrollment in regular courses, the entire program of study must be approved in advance by the dean of the student's school (in the case of graduate students, by the Dean of Graduate Studies). Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Undergraduate Students UCI undergraduate students who wish to enroll in courses at another institution in either a summer or regular session and to use such courses to satisfy any UCI requirements should secure approval from the Office of Admissions and their aca\u00ad demic dean. The Office of Admissions is responsible for determining if these credits are transferable to UCI, and the academic dean or director of the academic unit which offers the student's major is responsible for determining if the cred\u00ad its are applicable to major and breadth requirements. If such courses are determined by the Office of Admissions to be transferable, and if such courses do not duplicate other credit granted and do not exceed limitations of credit, then the units earned may be applied toward the total required for graduation. Forms for securing such authorization are available in the Office of Admissions and in deans' offices. Credits From Other Institutions or University Extension: Graduate Students Graduate students may be granted unit credit (not grade credit) toward a master's degree for acceptable graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through Univer\u00ad sity Extension prior to first enrollment in graduate study at UCI. To receive such credit, the student must initiate a for\u00ad mal petition after enrollment in graduate study. Approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies is required. While enrolled at UCI or on a Leave of Absence a graduate student may receive unit credit for graduate-level courses completed at another institution or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. See the Research and Graduate Studies section for further information about graduate transfer credit and the Univer\u00ad sity's Intercampus Exchange Program. Program of Academic Support Services The Program of Academic Support Services (PASS) is a cam\u00ad puswide academic assistance program focused on helping students develop their skills for and improve their knowledge in academic courses. Although PASS programs are not offered for credit, they are developed in coordination with academic departments. Presented in a coherent, pedagogically sound, and enriching manner, these programs are intended to meet the individual needs of all UCI students. For example, programs are available to students who desire greater aca\u00ad demic proficiency in courses ranging in level from introduc\u00ad tory through honors and upper division. Students who desire assistance have the opportunity to find a PASS program that is suited to their needs and that will make their education at UCI more successful and rewarding. Some of the major PASS programs are described below. Learning Skills staff provide programs designed to help stu\u00ad dents strengthen and develop their reading, writing, mathe\u00ad matics, science, analytic thinking, and study skills in order to enrich and enhance their education at UCI. Some Learning Skills programs are neither discipline- nor course-specific, but stress the development of abilities that all students need regardless of field or major. Such programs include work\u00ad shops and individual counseling in writing, time\u00ad management, overcoming procrastination, listening and note\u00ad taking, test-taking, and preparation for the graduate entrance examinations. Classes in critical reading are also offered. Learning Skills offers a, program of course-related adjuncts in conjunction with designated introductory courses in writing, humanities, chemistry, mathematics, and the social sciences. These adjuncts, coordinated with regular course instruction, provide an opportunity for students to improve their aca\u00ad demic skills in specific courses. The objective of the Tutorial Assistance Program (TAP) is to aid undergraduate students in comprehending and retaining course-specific subject matter and in developing the under\u00ad standing necessary for successful independent learning. Through small-group tutorials, TAP activities are designed to encourage student confidence and to cultivate, by maximizing a student's participation, his or her ability to work with and articulate aspects of the course. Tutoring is available in the following disciplines: the biological sciences, chemistry, com\u00ad puter science, engineering, the fine arts, the humanities, mathematics, physics, social ecology, and the social sciences. The PASS Writing Workshops seek to provide in-depth writ\u00ad ing assistance of a focused and methodical nature to students who may find English and Comparative Literature WR39A difficult because of insufficiencies in their University prepara\u00ad tion. This assistance, furnished to newly admitted students, addresses specific compositional weaknesses and endeavors to provide students, at an early stage of their coursework, with necessary verbal skills. Assistance is given in the form of workshops attached to special sections of English and Com\u00ad parative Literature WR39A. The Writing Workshops enable instructors to give intensive and individualized attention to students. Placement examinations are given in English as a second lan\u00ad guage, reading, chemistry, precalculus, and intermediate algebra. Test results provide students with information about their academic preparation before they enroll in classes. This information helps them formulate effective plans of study and enroll in classes for which they have the necessary prep\u00ad aration. Further information is available on page 23. See page 48 for further information on the Universitywide Subject A Examination.

Quarterly student fees allow this nonprofit organi\u00ad zation to provide leadership, representation, and entertain\u00ad ment, academic, and social activities for students. Services ASUCI funds, manages, and operates numerous student ser\u00ad vices on campus. Outroads-ASUCI Travel Service provides the campus community with travel information, airline tickets, tours, worldwide travel packages, charter flights, stu\u00ad dent discount flights, cruises, rail passes, passport photos, student travel identification, and travel seminars. The ASUCI Recycling Center, located at North Campus, is the only multi\u00ad material, 24-hour, drop-off center in the Irvine/Newport UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Beach area. The Center recycles newspaper, ledger paper, aluminum cans, glass, cardboard, motor oil, and batteries. The ASUCI supports the College Legal Clinic which provides free legal assistance and attorney consultations for students. The ASUCI office is open regular business hours when staff can answer questions and provide directions or assistance. ASUCI entertainment services offer all students varying diversions for their leisure hours. Major concerts occur in Crawford Hall at least twice a quarter, and popular films are shown for free or at reduced rates. Speakers appear periodi\u00ad cally under ASUCI's sponsorship, with lectures covering politics, economics, humor, and humanism. On select week\u00ad ends the Soundstage program allows students to see popular club acts perform on campus at a reduced admission charge. Oktoberfest is held in the fall, a St. Patrick's Day festival in the winter, and each spring Wayzgoose, a student festival with a Renaissance theme, is held in Aldrich Park. The UCI Pep Band and Squad, funded by ASUCI, supports UCI athletic teams with rallies, dances, rooter sections, and other spirit-raising activities. These programs are operated by stu\u00ad dent commissions, which all students are encouraged to join. Organization The ASUCI government consists of a 25-member Council, including 20 representatives from the academic schools and programs and five executive officers, who are elected for one-year terms by the student body each spring. The execu\u00ad tive officers help ASUCI achieve its primary goal, to be wholly responsive to student needs and desires. The Presi\u00ad dent deals with Universitywide issues affecting undergradu\u00ad ates, administers the ASUCI budget, and is the primary spokesperson for the Associated Students in policy determi\u00ad nations with campus and systemwide administrations. In addition, the President coordinates student advocacy in both Sacramento and nearby Orange County communities. The Executive Vice President chairs Legislative Council meetings, serves on the Registration Fee Advisory Committee, and supervises\u00b7 the management of all ASUCI elections. The Vice President for Academic Services is the primary student liai\u00ad son to the campus and Universitywide Academic Senate, directs the Student Recommended Faculty Program (through which students can nominate visiting lecturers), and coordi\u00ad nates publication of the annual Teacher Evaluation Hand\u00ad book. The Vice President for Administrative Services appoints and monitors more than 60 student representatives to UCI administrative and Academic Senate committees. The Vice President for Student Services investigates new ser\u00ad vices, evaluates current programs, and coordinates all ASUCI entertainment programming. Each of the executive officers works with several appointed student commissioners to carry out these tasks. ASUCI policy and final budgetary decisions are made by the Council. Each councilperson sits on at least one subcommit\u00ad tee of the Council. Council elections are held in fall and spring with 10 (or half) of the Council seats filled in each election. Representation The University of California Student Association (UCSA) Board of Directors is the official Universitywide voice of stu\u00ad dents and acts in their collective interests. The UCSA Board was formed in 1970 by undergraduate student body presi\u00ad dents. Since then, UCSA has served as a student advisory committee to the Office of the President. Some of the responsibilities of the Board include selection of the Student Regent, appointment of students to Universitywide commit\u00ad tees, advising the Board of Regents, and directing the UC Student Lobby through which student interests are pro\u00ad moted in Sacramento and Universitywide. Campus Life and Student Activities 65 On the Irvine campus, one undergraduate and one graduate student are selected by their respective presidents to serve on the Board of Directors of UCSA. Students also are encour\u00ad aged to participate in and are appointed to serve on the Chancellor's Advisory, Academic Senate, campus administra\u00ad tive, and ad hoc committees. Involvement ASUCI's primary goal is to further the control by students over their own curricula, funds, administration, and student life. All students concerned about academics, services, repre\u00ad sentation, or entertainment can reach their Council represen\u00ad tative or the executive officers at ASUCI, University Center, (714) 856-5547. Associated Graduate Students All graduate and medical students are members of the Asso\u00ad ciated Graduate Students (AGS). The purpose of AGS is to promote and provide for the distinct needs and priorities of graduate students. The AGS office is located in the Univer\u00ad sity Center; AGS representatives can be reached at (714) 856-6351. . Services AGS provides graduate students with numerous student\u00ad operated services. AGS is the publisher of Grad Times, a news magazine for graduate students. AGS provides enter\u00ad tainment for graduate students, allocates funds for graduate student projects, funds the College Legal Clinic, and offers a summer loan program. Organization AGS is governed by a council of members elected from each academic unit conducting a graduate program, a president, who is elected in a campuswide election held during spring quarter, and four vice presidents selected by the AGS Coun\u00ad cil: the Vice President-Internal Affairs, Vice President\u00ad External Affairs, Vice President-Administrative Affairs, and Vice President-Financial Affairs. The AGS Council is an independent entity within UCI, with the exclusive responsi\u00ad bility for representing all graduate students to the UCI administration, Office of the President, and the community at large. The AGS Council nominates graduate students for positions on UCI administrative committees, UCI Academic Senate committees, ad hoc committees, and committees established by the University's Office of the President. AGS representa\u00ad tives work with the Student Body Presidents' Council and the UC Student Lobby to implement legislation which is sup\u00ad portive of students and crucial to the social needs of the wider community. Medical Students Organization The Medical Students Organization (MSO) is governed by an elected student council composed of two officers from each class and a student body president, vice president, secretary, and treasurer. The MSO Council along with the AGS Coun\u00ad cil represents the medical student body in all matters relating to the UCI campus, the University's Office of the President, and the community. Medical students, as members of AGS, have access to all ser\u00ad vices funded by the Associated Graduate Students. In addi\u00ad tion to these services, the MSO Council utilizes a portion of the quarterly AGS fee to provide funding for medical student projects activities that benefit the medical school community. UC IRVINE - 1987-198866 Campus and Student Services Undergraduate Administrative Intern Program The Undergraduate Administrative Intern Program provides participating students with administrative and leadership experience designed to develop personal and professional skills as well as to increase the students' knowledge of com\u00ad plex organizational structures. Fifteen to 20 students are selected each year and assigned to campus administrative units where they develop programs and projects that benefit student life at UCI. Academic credit, through participation in a weekly seminar, and a stipend are earned by the intern.

Each hall houses from 40 to 60 students and a student resident assistant or resident staff member. The small-scale buildings provide excellent opportunities for social interaction, student government, and leadership experience. Liberal use of wood in building design and attractive landscaping help to create a home-like environment. The residences are divided into suites of four or five double rooms, with living room and bath; each residence also contains a lounge and recreation and study rooms. A limited number of single rooms also are available in each residence hall. Every room has carpeting and draperies, and is furnished with a bed, desk, chair, chest of drawers, closet, and bookshelves for each student. Both Mesa Court and Middle Earth have complete food service and din\u00ad ing commons for their residents. The halls are closed during the Christmas and spring recesses. Each hall tends to have distinctive characteristics and often focuses on a specific interest or life-style. Examples include halls devoted to the fine arts, the humanities, languages, the outdoors, or crafts. Students who live in the residence halls participate in a prepaid meal plan. Meals are served cafeteria\u00ad style, and the menu offers a wide selection of food, with fresh fruit and an array of salads daily. Meals are served three times daily on weekdays (brunch and dinner only on Saturday and Sunday) in the Mesa Court and Middle Earth Commons. The Student Programs Offices at Mesa Court and Middle Earth have responsibility for providing student residents with an environment conducive to their intellectual, social, and personal growth. The housing staffs work closely with students to create opportunities for educational exploration and ways of developing interpersonal skills. The residence halls have distinctive personalities. In many cases, an aca\u00ad demic interest characterizes a hall style: fine arts, social scien\u00ad ces, the humanities, and languages are represented in the special-interest halls on campus. The Outdoor and Photog\u00ad raphy Halls are examples of special interest hall programs. Weekend field trips and retreats, designed to amplify on\u00ad campus experiences, are often part of the interest hall pro\u00ad grams. The Student Programs Offices also supervise and train resident assistants and resident staff, advise the resi\u00ad dential student government, and coordinate information and skill development workshops. Campus and Student Services 67 An unusual housing option at UCI is the 80-space recrea\u00ad tional vehicle park, Irvine Meadows West, which provides housing for graduate and undergraduate students. The rate for 1987-88 is $78 per month per space. Students must pro\u00ad vide their own recreational vehicle or trailer which must con\u00ad tain a sink, hardware for running water, and a stove. An application for Irvine Meadows West may be obtained from the On-Campus Housing Office; there is a $15 nonrefund\u00ad able application fee. Currently, there is a waiting list. An apartment complex for single undergraduates, Campus Village, offers 200 two-bedroom apartments housing 800 students. More than half of the units are furnished; all apartments include carpeting, draperies, a stove, and a refrig\u00ad erator. Various programs are offered in the Community Cen\u00ad ter Building, and in the complexes' two lounges and recrea\u00ad tion buildings. Annual rates, which include utilities, are $2,337 per student for an unfurnished apartment and $2,617 per student for a furnished apartment for 1987-88. An increase in rates for 1988-89 is anticipated. The University also has 862 one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments in Verano Place for full-time registered students who are married, single parents, graduate students, or who are single and 25 years of age or older. The majority of the apartments are unfurnished, and all have carpeting, draper\u00ad ies, a stove, and a refrigerator. They are attractive and con\u00ad siderably lower in rent than comparable units in local com\u00ad munities. An assortment of social, cultural, and educational programs such as community dinners, courses, and work\u00ad shops is offered in the community. Students may apply to live in Verano Place at any time by requesting an application from the On-Campus Housing Office. A nonrefundable application fee of $15 must accompany the application. Appli\u00ad cation should be made well in advance of the date the student wishes to move in. Undergraduate applicants wanting to live in the under gradu\u00ad ate residence halls or apartments must indicate their interest in on-campus housing by marking the appropriate item on the UC Undergraduate Application for Admission in order to receive an application for housing. Due to the large demand for housing, newly admitted students wishing to live on campus will participate in a lottery for housing space. To be eligible for the lottery, prospective students must return their housing application by February 8, accompanied by a $15 nonrefundable application fee. (Housing applications received after February 8 will not be placed in the lottery.) The lottery will be held on February 19. Names of applicants will be drawn in random order. Letters will be sent to applicants regarding their lottery status by late February. To maintain lottery status, the student must have been accepted for admission to UCI and their Statement of Intention to Regis\u00ad ter (SIR) must have been received by the Admissions Office on or before May 1 . Only those prospective students who have returned both their housing application and their SIR will be eligible to receive a housing contract. Any applicant for housing who is admitted to UCI but who does not return their SIR by May 1 will lose their lottery status, and their names will be removed from the housing list. Those students who do not receive notification of their admission status prior to May 1 will retain their lottery position but must return their SIR by the date indicated on it. In addition, prior\u00ad ity is given to those students who live outside a specified radius from campus who apply for the undergraduate resi\u00ad dence halls or undergraduate apartments between November 1 and February 8. Continuing undergraduates must partici\u00ad pate in a lottery for space in the residence halls or under\u00ad graduate apartments for the following academic year. UC IRVINE - 1987-198868 Campus and Student Services Students who become eligible for residence hall contracts will be obliged to pay approximately $100 as a reservation fee at the time the contract is returned to the University; any can\u00ad cellation, regardless of the circumstances or time of year, will result in a nonrefundable cancellation fee. Charges for 1987- 88 are $4,825 for a single room and $4,387 for a space in a double room; both rates include an $20 annual association fee. We anticipate an increase in cost for the 1988-89 aca\u00ad demic year. The cost of room and board in the residence halls is paid in quarterly payments. Students who live off campus may wish to take advantage of the Nonresident Meal Contract. This contract, good for any quarter, enables a student to eat 19 meals per week in Mesa Commons. For spring quarter, 1987, the price of the meal plan was $7.00 per day.

The main telephone number for Student Health is (714) 856-5301. A basic insurance program also is available which provides limited coverage for emergency care and hospitalization when such care is required but not available at the Student Health Service. To be qualified to receive the benefits of this insurance, each fully registered student must have complied with the medical history and physical examination require\u00ad ment of UCI. Students are not eligible for insurance benefits until these records are on file in the medical records department of the Student Health Service. Medical history and physical examina\u00ad tion forms are mailed to new undergraduate and graduate students and to readmitted students as their names become available to the Student Health Service. Medical students receive the packets from Medical Student Admissions. Inter\u00ad national students' packets are mailed by International Stu\u00ad dent Services with their initial registration packet. Students should check with the Student Health Service for informa\u00ad tion on the benefits and limitations under the insurance plan. Student Health coverage extends from the first day of the quarter to but not including the first day of the following quarter, but begins only after the student has paid the full Registration Fee and has been issued the Class Verification and Identification Card. There is an exception for spring quarter coverage which extends only to the last day of that quarter. Optional additional insurance for students, spouses, and chil\u00ad dren and coverage for the summer or one unregistered quar\u00ad ter each year is available. Enrollment in this plan is limited to a short time at the beginning of each quarter. To ensure cov\u00ad erage, students should visit the Student Health Center dur\u00ad ing the first week of each quarter for information and appli\u00ad cation forms. Physical Examinations and Health Clearances. All new stu\u00ad dents and students returning to UCI after an absence of two or more quarters are required to have a complete physical examination within 90 days prior to the first day of the quar\u00ad ter. Students returning after participation in the Education Abroad Program must comply with this requirement upon their return to UCI. The examination should be performed by the student's own physician. If this is impractical, the examination can be obtained at the Student Health Service for a moderate charge. Please call for an appointment. Stu\u00ad dents transferring from another University of California campus where their medical records are on file should have the records transferred to UCI Health Services. Failure to comply with the physical examination requirement results in loss of insurance eligibility, and a fee for services provided by the Student Health Service. Student Health coverage provides as many services as possi\u00ad ble without additional charge; however, some services are available only on a fee-for-service basis. Some of the services available for a charge are: immunizations; allergy desensitiza\u00ad tion injections; prescriptions from the Student services including minor surgery; elective labor\u00ad atory tests; and, time permitting, physical examinations for employment, insurance, or a marriage license.

Nosanow Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies Research and graduate education, two major areas of respon\u00ad sibility of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, are vital and integral parts of academic life at UCI. Programs leading to doctoral or master's degrees are offered in more than 40 academic and professional areas. Many of UCI's graduate programs and research activities have achieved national reputations for excellence, and several are interna\u00ad tionally recognized as leaders in their respective fields. UCI graduate programs continue to grow and to evolve in direc\u00ad tions that are consistent with the University's teaching, research, and public service missions. Graduate study at UCI provides the excitement and satisfaction that spring from the discovery and dissemination of new knowledge, as well as from meeting new challenges. The Vice Chancellor for Research and Dean of Graduate Studies has general administrative responsibility for research and graduate education. In the area of research, the Vice Chancellor has responsibility for the administration of extramurally funded training grants, general research admin\u00ad istration, and research policy development and implementa\u00ad tion. Graduate education responsibilities include admissions, enrolled-student actions and advising, degree awards, fellow\u00ad ship and assistantship administration, Teaching Assistant training, and the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Program, which facilitates the involvement of minority stu\u00ad dents and women in graduate education. The Office of Research and Graduate Studies also is adminis\u00ad tratively responsible for Organized Research Units, Focused Research Programs, Contracts and Grants Administration, and other campus research activities. The following sections describe areas of research and graduate education, and include information about academic regulations and policies important to applicants and graduate students. Research The University of California is the State's primary research institution. Most scholarly research and creative activities are supported by University funds or by grants and contracts from federal and state agencies, foundations, corporations, and individual sponsors. In addition to University funding, more than $51 million from extramural sources was awarded to the University of California, Irvine in the 1985-86 fiscal year for basic and applied research and for other scholarly activity. The Vice Chancellor for Research has responsibility for research administration, including research policy, research development, organized research activities, UCI-industry relations involving research, animal research administration, and research committee support. In addition, the Vice Chan\u00ad cellor is responsible for contracts and grants administration which includes the submission of proposals, acceptance of grant and contract awards, and negotiation of all awards for extramurally funded research, training, fellowship, and public service programs. The Office of Research and Graduate Studies also maintains a Resource Center containing the most current information about extramural funding sources for student and faculty research. While most research takes place at the academic unit level, the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs is enhanced by Organized Research Units and Focused Research Programs that extend beyond unit boundaries. Organized Research Units An Organized Research Unit (ORU) ordinarily consists of an interdepartmental group of faculty, students, and other researchers engaged in a continuing program of research, supported by both University and extramural funding. The work of some ORUs is directed toward the solution of com\u00ad plex contemporary problems, while others conduct basic research essential to the understanding of natural or social phenomena or of humanistic ideas and expressions. Organ\u00ad ized Research Units established on the Irvine campus by .The Regents of the University are the Cancer Research Institute, the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, the Developmental Biology Center, the Institute of Transpor\u00ad tation Studies (ITS), and the Public Policy Research Organi\u00ad zation (PPRO). Cancer Research Institute The Cancer Research Institute is an Organized Research Unit established by The Regents of the University in early 1980 to provide leadership and support for researchers work\u00ad ing toward understanding and controlling cancer. The Insti\u00ad tute serves as a means of focusing, coordinating, and direct\u00ad ing efforts of scholars in basic and clinical sciences from sev\u00ad eral departments of the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine. The ORU provides a central source of information concerning cancer-related research, as well as a forum in which basic researchers and clinicians can assess advances that may be of immediate value in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, and in the detection of chemicals or con\u00ad ditions that cause canc~r. Ongoing and projected research activities involve the regulation of cell function, viral carcino\u00ad genesis, immunology, and basic molecular processes relevant to cancer. Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory The Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory was established to foster multidisciplinary research which will provide an understanding of the neurobiological pro\u00ad cesses underlying learning and memory. Research efforts are stimulated and coordinated through research seminars, collo\u00ad quia, quarterly meetings, and international conferences, as well as collaborative research projects involving faculty members of the Center, visiting fellows, postdoctoral fellows, graduate students, and undergraduate students. The research programs of the Center include investigations at several lev\u00ad els of analysis, including cell chemistry, cell physiology, brain systems, and cognitive processes. Members include faculty from the Department of Psychobiology in the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences, the Department of Pharmacology in the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine, the Department of Information and Com\u00ad puter Science, the Department of Physics in the School of Physical Sciences, and the School of Social Sciences, as well as three faculty members from other UC campuses. Developmental Biology Center The Developmental Biology Center is an Organized Research Unit that provides focus and support in several related areas of developmental biology and genetics. The major goal of the Center is to understand the mechanisms responsible for the control of growth and the generation of spatial patterns of differentiation during development. Experimental techniques and concepts from the fields of cell biology, embryology, genetics, neurobiology, molecular biology, immunology, and endocrinology are applied to developing insects, hydra, fish, amphibians, birds, and mammals. Undergraduate and gradu\u00ad ate students and postdoctoral fellows all participate actively UC IRVINE - 1987-1988with faculty from the School of Biological Sciences and the College of Medicine in these research programs. The Center also sponsors and organizes a variety of local, national, and international conferences and hosts visiting scientists for col\u00ad laborative research work. The work carried out in the Center has potential implications in such areas as the control of growth, the regeneration of lost body parts, and the cause and prevention of cancer, nervous system anomalies, and birth defects in humans: Institute of Transportation Studies The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) was established to foster research, education, and training in the field of transportation. The Institute has been an Organized Research Unit within the University of California since 1947. With the establishment of the Irvine branch in 1974, it became a Universitywide Multicampus Research Unit, the only such unit on the Irvine campus. A fundamental goal of the Institute at UCI is the stimulation of interdisciplinary research on contemporary transportation issues. ITS research involves faculty and students from the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Management, the School of Social Sciences, the Program in Social Ecology, and the Department of Information and Computer Science. The Institute also hosts visiting scholars from the U.S. and abroad to facilitate collaborative research and information exchange, and sponsors graduate student research assistant\u00ad ships. These positions enable qualified students to work closely with faculty and professional research personnel on a wide range of research projects, providing valuable prepro\u00ad fessional experience. Current research focuses upon planning and analysis of transportation systems, transportation engineering, trans\u00ad portation economics, administrative issues in transportation management, and energy and environmental issues. Recent projects have addressed control of urban freeway traffic, strategies for urban highway reconstruction, urban freeway traffic safety, statistical measurement of public transit per\u00ad formance, the use of part-time labor in public transit, compu\u00ad ter simulation of household travel patterns, land use/trans\u00ad portation interactions, and application of expert systems to pavement rehabilitation. The transportation research program at Irvine is supported by the ITS Systems Center and the ITS Information Center. The ITS Systems Center offers a variety of computer ser\u00ad vices to catalog, maintain, and develop software in support of transportation research and training. The Systems Center houses a VAX 11/725 virtual memory minicomputer, two MicroVAXII super microcomputers, and a number of per\u00ad sonal computers. The Center contains more than 25,000 books, technical reports, journals, and dissertations in the field of transportation and offers a variety of manual and computer-based information. Students and faculty are encouraged to meet with the Center's trained personnel to discuss research strategies and data needs. As a link to the professional community, ITS-Irvine has an active extension program. The Institute sponsors the Transit Managerial Effectiveness Program, an intensive training pro\u00ad gram for mid-to upper-level transit managers, attracts par\u00ad ticipants from transit agencies nationwide. In conjunction with University Extension, ITS also sponsors certificate pro\u00ad grams and specialty conferences, such as the national Work\u00ad shop on Mobility for Metropolitan Growth Centers which was held in November 1984 and the National Conference in Commuter Lanes and Transitways held in November 1986. A new Certificate Program in the Design and Management of Organized Research Units 71 Organized Research Units and Focused Research Programs enhance the academic quality of many of UCI's educational programs. Traffic Control Systems is planned for implementation in 1987. The Institute also sponsors biweekly research colloquia designed to disseminate the results of research to the broader community. Public Policy Research Organization The Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) is an Organized Research Unit established to foster basic social science research for theory development and testing, and to inform those involved with policy development. In pursuing its broad policies studies mission, PPRO has focused its efforts on four programmatic research areas: organizational impacts of technology; community and environmental issues; organizational management; and issues of interest to Orange County including an annual survey of Orange County residents. PPRO draws its research expertise from the full faculty and student resources of the Irvine campus. The Graduate School of Management, the Program in Social Ecology, the Depart\u00ad ment of Information and Computer Science, the College of Medicine, and the Schools of Social Sciences and Humanities are represented in the 135 faculty and students currently conducting research in PPRO. Their areas of expertise include law, public administration, economics, information and computer science, public finance, political science, sociol\u00ad ogy, psychology, planning, history, and public health. Like the research staff, PPRO research projects reflect a mul\u00ad tidisciplinary nature. Current studies include the future and use of information systems in local governments; the social and mental health impacts of economic change; stress and coping skills among U.S. Marine Corps drill instructors; effects of seat belt restraint on the incidence of injuries to UC IRVINE - 1987-198872 Focused Research Programs children in automobiles; the impacts of computing in the home; the physical effects of acid fog; and the use and impact of white-collar worker utilization of office automation. All PPRO projects are based in the social sciences, and many have requirements for original data collection. In support of the data collection activities, PPRO has recently developed a Center for Survey Research which includes state-of-the-art Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) capability. In addition, PPRO provides professional support in data man\u00ad agement and data analysis and has created a data archive serving as the campus representative to the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). A limited number of graduate assistantships and work-study positions are available to qualified UCI students who wish to participate in PPRO research projects, including data collec\u00ad tion in the Center for Survey Research, or the preparation of research proposals. Focused Research Programs Focused Research Programs are established for the purpose of developing and, for a limited period of time, sustaining interdisciplinary research that could not be carried out through individual effort or within a single academic unit. Because of the developmental nature of these programs, they ordinarily are approved for no more than three years and are supported partly by University funds. If a research program develops successfully, it may continue with extramural and/or University support. Twelve groups of faculty, students, and other researchers currently are recognized as Focused Research Programs. Combustion Science and Technology Researchers from the Department of Mechanical Engineering in the School of Engineering, the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences, and the Department of Community and Environmental Medicine in the College of Medicine are working under the auspices of the UCI Com\u00ad bustion Laboratory to apply advanced laser diagnostics and advanced computational methods to the processes of turbu\u00ad lent transport, chemical reactions, fuel injection, and fuel/air mixing; the formation of soot and gaseous pollutants; and the study of health impacts associated with combustion effluent. Computational Chemistry Faculty in the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences have established a program to further the development of computational technologies and to encourage and explore the use of these technologies for the chemical sciences. Using recent advances in digital computer technol\u00ad ogy, the participants are attempting to establish at Irvine a model for the manner in which chemical studies will be con\u00ad ducted in the future. Computation and Learning Faculty from the School of Social Sciences and the Depart\u00ad ment of Information and Computer Science are conducting three major related projects as the core of this program, each of which attempts to integrate the results of previous research in the area of computation and learning. The overall objective of the program is to develop computational models of human concept formulation, strategy learning, and lan\u00ad guage acquisition, and to begin combining these into an inte\u00ad grated model of the human learning process. Convex Programming Participants in this program include faculty from the Schools of Social Sciences and Engineering, the Department of information and Computer Science, and the Graduate School of Management. The program's interdisciplinary approach brings together optimization theorists and applied researchers to focus on a way of mathematically modeling and analyzing decision-making situations. Specific attention is given to the potential and problems of convex programming in solving a variety of important problems associated with our modern society, in areas such as high-tech industries and national defense. Critical Theory Faculty participants in this program are from the Depart\u00ad ments of English and Comparative Literature, French and Italian, History, Philosophy, and Spanish and Portuguese in the School of Humanities, and from the School of Fine Arts. The program's goal is to provide a forum for debate among the competing theoretical movements in contemporary criti\u00ad cal theory. It has presented a series of lectures and seminars during each of the first two years and held a major sympo\u00ad sium in the third year on issues being debated in critical theory. Gender and Women's Studies Participants include faculty from the Departments of English and Comparative Literature, French and Italian, German, History, and Spanish and Portuguese in the School of Humanities; the School of Social Sciences; and the Graduate School of Management. Researchers are exploring structural characteristics underlying gender differences and definition patterns in society and will integrate and synthesize previous interdisciplinary research in this area. Problems are ap\u00ad proached from the perspectives of women's studies, soci?l\u00ad ogy, psychoanalysis, literary history and theory, econom1cs, and social history. Image Engineering Faculty from the Schools of Engineering and Social Sciences, the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences, and the Departments of Radiological Sciences and Medicine in the College of Medicine are participating in the design, manufacture, and operation of systems that incorpo\u00ad rate two or more of the technologies that depend heavily on the acquisition, formation, transmission, storage, analysis, and/or display of images, as well as with advancing these technologies individually. The program promotes cross\u00ad disciplinary research that is relevant to industrial needs and collaboration with other educational institutions. It builds upon a dozen image-based research activities at UCI and on the image engineering activities of more than one hundred high-tech industrial firms in Orange County. Medieval Theatre Faculty from the Departments of English and Comparative Literature, French and Italian, German, History, and Spanish and Portuguese in the School of Humanities and from the School of Fine Arts are involved in research and production activities centered on the Corpus Christi Plays produced in English between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries. Project activities have included a first-year symposium and actual production of the plays during the summer of the second year of the project. Ultimate goals of the focused research program include further performances, development of videotapes of i:he performances, and a possible creation of a UC Consortium in Medieval Studies. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Mexico/Chicano Area Studies Faculty participants include researchers representing the Schools of Biological Sciences, Fine Arts, Humanities, Social Sciences, and the Program in Social Ecology. The program is designed to provide coordination and development of support bases for faculty and graduate student research in the areas of Mexican studies, Chicano studies, U.S.-Mexico relations, and collaborations between scientists from the University of California and Mexico. Research studies include such topics as immigration, public policy, culture, literature and film, communications, urbanization, and agriculture. Molecular Biology of Eucaryotic Viruses Faculty participants in this program are from the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences and the Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics in the College of Medicine. The goal of the program is to provide a core facility for the collaborative interaction among faculty researchers working in several related areas of virology. A major activity is the development of communication between virologists in the UCI community and their colleagues at other institutions. Objective Drama Faculty from the School of Fine Arts, the Department of Eng\u00ad lish and Comparative Literature in the School of Humanities, and the School of Social Sciences engage in cross-cultural and interdisciplinary research with the purpose of isolating and studying the technical aspects of ritualized interaction, i.e., the elements in the liturgies and rituals of various world cul\u00ad tures which have an objective impact on both performers and participants. Studies center on movements, sonorities, rhythms, and uses of space as they exist in the ritual forms of ancient non-Western cultures, with an eye toward better understanding the underlying elements of such performative acts. Work Environments Faculty researchers from the Program in Social Ecology, the Graduate School of Management, the Department of Infor\u00ad mation and Computer Science, the School of Social Sciences, and the University's Southern Occupational Health Center are collaborating on studies on the physical and social fea\u00ad tures of work environments and their impact on employee health, productivity, and morale. Graduate Education With the exception of programs conducted by the College of Medicine for the training of medical professionals, the Dean of Graduate Studies administers graduate education, in accordance with academic policies established by the Aca\u00ad demic Senate and by the Graduate Council, a standing com\u00ad mittee of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate. There is no separate graduate faculty at UCI; graduate work is supervised by academic units and faculties which have con\u00ad current responsibility for undergraduate studies. A great deal of information about graduate education at UCI is published in the UCJ General Catalogue, the annual gradu\u00ad ate study announcement, and individual graduate program publications. The staff of the Office of Research and Gradu\u00ad ate Studies is ready to help answer questions about admis\u00ad sion, academic policies and procedures, graduate programs and degrees, financial assistance, student services, and other matters of concern to applicants or graduate students. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram (GPOP), positive steps are being taken to increase the Graduate Education/Application Procedures 73 participation of minorities, and women in certain fields, in the graduate academic and professional programs of the Uni\u00ad versity. Appropriate assistance is offered during the admis\u00ad sion process, and every effort is made through GPOP advis\u00ad ing and support to ensure that all students will have a reason\u00ad able chance to attain their academic objectives. UCI does not discriminate against any applicant on the basis of race, reli\u00ad gion, color, national origin, sex, age, handicap, or marital status. Admission to Graduate Standing Applicants for admission to graduate study at UCI must apply for acceptance into a specific graduate program to work toward an advanced degree. A general requirement for admission is that the applicant hold the degree of Bachelor of Arts, Letters, Philosophy, or Science (or an acceptable equiv\u00ad alent) from a recognized academic institution. A grade point average of at least B (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is required. Each applicant's file is evaluated by the admissions committee of the specific graduate program and by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies on the basis of such factors as academic subject preparation, scholarship, letters of recommendation, test scores, and examples of previous work. A critical question is whether the applicant's academic objectives can reasonably be satisfied by the graduate programs on this campus. The Uni\u00ad versity of California does not have the capacity to accommo\u00ad date all applicants who meet the minimum admission requirements. Prospective graduate students are encouraged to assess the professional placement opportunities that are anticipated in the field of interest. It is generally recognized that the number of traditional academic appointments in certain disci\u00ad plines is limited. There are, however, other attractive career options, many of them as yet unrecognized, for highly moti\u00ad vated men and women who demonstrate intellectual strength, integrity, and discipline in earning an advanced degree from a respected university. UCI is committed to help\u00ad ing graduate students develop, in addition to their academic training, the communication and problem-solving skills that also may be critical to future careers. Application Procedures How to Apply Applicants must complete the Application for Admission which may be obtained by contacting individual graduate programs or the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. The application must be submitted on the forms supplied by UCI and accompanied by a check, draft, or money order pay\u00ad able to Regents-UC in the exact amount of the $35 Applica\u00ad tion Fee. This fee is not refundable. Detailed instructions on how to complete the application are contained in the applica\u00ad tion packet. When to Apply For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January I to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Some academic units will accept appli\u00ad cations for winter or spring quarter admission for which deadlines are October-IS and January IS respectively. In order to process applications in time for the applicant to receive fullconsideration, letters of recommendation, official transcripts, and test scores must be received before the pub\u00ad lished deadlines. Applications for admission received after the published deadline for the quarter requested will be deferred automatically to the next open quarter. UC IRVINE - 1987-198874 Graduate Education/Application Procedures Required Supporting Documents Letters of Recommendation Applicants should arrange to have three letters of recom\u00ad mendation forwarded directly to their prospective major department or program. Recommendation forms are enclosed in the application packet. Only one set of recommendation letters needs to be submitted in support of an application for admission and fellowship or assistantship consideration. It is important that letters of recommendation be completed by professors or instructors in disciplines related to the proposed course of study who are in a position to analyze an applicant's abilities and academic promise. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) Scores All applicants are required to take the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test, with the following excep\u00ad tions: (1) the Graduate School of Management prefers that applicants take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT), and (2) no tests are required of those who seek the Master of Fine Arts degree, the Master of Arts in Teaching, or California education credentials. There is no minimum GRE score. Several programs also require, or strongly recommend, that an applicant report the score of a GRE Sub\u00ad ject Test. Applicants should register for either the October or December test dates to ensure the timely receipt of their score results for admission consideration. The GREis admin\u00ad istered five times a year in the United States and in 96 other countries. In addition, several administrative service tests are given each year iii major U.S. cities (dates vary). Applications for the GRE may be obtained from the Educational Testing Service, P.O. Box 955, Princeton, New Jersey 08541. Academic Records Domestic applicants should request that official transcripts be forwarded directly to their prospective major department or program. Two complete sets of official records covering all postsecondary academic work attempted, regardless of length of attendance, are required. University of California tran\u00ad scripts must also be requested by applicants, including those who are UCI undergraduates. Applicants with academic work in progress must expect to complete their undergraduate degree programs before the intended date of enrollment at UCI and must submit evidence of degree conferral before officially enrolling. Foreign Academic Records Official records from overseas institutions should be sent directly to the Office of Research and Graduate Studies at UCI for an evaluation. The Office will then forward the doc\u00ad uments to the student's major department. Records of aca\u00ad demic study from foreign institutions must be official, bear\u00ad ing the signature of the registrar and the seal of i:he issuing institution. Applicants should not send the original of an aca\u00ad demic record which cannot be replaced; they should obtain instead properly certified copies. Unless academic records and diplomas are issued in English by the institution, the official records in their original language must be submitted with an authorized, complete, and exact English translation. Foreign academic records must be in duplicate and include all subjects or courses taken on a yearly basis, together with the units of credit or time allotted to each subject each term or year and the marks or ratings in each subject or examination passed. In all cases, the institutional grading scale or other standard of evaluation, including maximal passing and failing marks and definition of grades between them, should appear on official records or as an official attachment. Official evidence of degree conferral must also be supplied, together with evi\u00ad dence of rank in class if available. Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) All applicants whose primary language is not English are required to submit the test results of the TOEFL examina\u00ad tion. The TOEFL examination should be taken at the earliest available date to allow for scores to be reported in time to meet the application deadlines. A score of 550 or better is required for admission consideration. Arrangements for tak\u00ad ing the TOEFL may be made through the nearest United States Embassy or by writing to the Educational Testing Ser\u00ad vice, P.O. Box 2896, Princeton, New Jersey 08541. Test of Spoken English (TSE) All applicants whose primary language is not English and who wish to be considered for a Teaching Assistantship appointment must undergo and submit results for the Test of Spoken English (TSE). A minimum score of 220 is required in order for a TA offer to be made without an on-campus eval\u00ad uation. The Test of Spoken English is given six times during the year at TOEFL test centers around the world. Informa\u00ad tion on taking the TSE may be obtained by writing to the Test of Spoken English, P.O. Box 2918, Princeton, New Jer\u00ad sey 08541. Special Note to Foreign Applicants Foreign applicants are required to certify that they possess sufficient funds to cover all fees, transportation, and living expenses for the duration of their studies at UCI. A Foreign Applicant Questionnaire for the purpose of verifyi.ng the amount and source of funds available for graduate study will be forwarded to foreign applicants upon receipt of the com\u00ad pleted Application for Admission. The required financial veri\u00ad fication must be provided before formal admission can be offered and visa forms issued. Admission and Registration A formal notice of the admission decision is sent to each applicant by the Dean of Graduate Studies as soon as possible after the application and complet~ records are received, and after the department has made a recommendation. Only the official Notification of Admission from the Dean of Graduate Studies constitutes formal admission to a graduate program at UCI. The official notification will be mailed well in advance of the beginning of the quarter for which application has been made. Admission to graduate standing does not constitute registra\u00ad tion for classes. A student is not officially registered for classes until the entire registration procedure is completed each quarter. Information on registration dates and proce\u00ad dures will be mailed to new applicants prior to the registra\u00ad tion cycle. If any applicant wishes to defer admission to a later academic quarter, the Office of Research and. Graduate Studies must be notified in writing. After formal admission has been offered, the academic unit m.ust approve a request for deferral. Limited Status University of California academic regulations provide for the admission of students to Limited Status for two purposes: (1) to prepare for admission to a graduate or professional program by enrolling for a prescribed set of courses; or (2) to pursue a specific academic program which does not lead to a UC IRVINE - 1987-1988graduate degree. While Limited Status is intended to serve a broad range of educational objectives, the most common objective for which the Dean of Graduate Studies offers Limited Status admission is study leading to California educa\u00ad tion credentials. The general requirements for admission to Limited Status are the same as those for graduate admission, with the exception that Graduate Record Examination scores are not required. Admission to Limited Status is ordinarily for a period of three quarters (one academic year) and does not imply admission to a UCI graduate degree program at some later date. Although Limited Status does not represent graduate stand\u00ad ing, admission is offered by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of an academic unit which has agreed to oversee the student's program. Graduate courses taken while in Limited Status ordinarily qualify for transfer credit toward advanced degree requirements, but will not satisfy minimum degree or residency requirements for any UC graduate program to which the student eventually might be admitted. Academic Advising In each academic unit with an advanced degree program, there is at least one formally appointed Graduate Advisor or Director of Graduate Studies. The Graduate Advisor is a regular faculty member responsible for supervising graduate study in that unit, for monitoring the academic progress of graduate students, and for seeing that each graduate student is assigned a faculty advisor. The Graduate Advisor plays a key role in the academic lives of graduate students, advising students and other faculty members about program require\u00ad ments and the academic policies of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, approving study lists, and evaluating academic petitions. In many academic units the Graduate Advisor is instrumental in the selection of students for assistantship and fellowship appointments, and in the super\u00ad vision of graduate student teachers. In most schools there also is an Associate Dean for Graduate Studies who coordi\u00ad nates many of the functions which affect graduate students within that school. Both Graduate Advisors and Deans are important links between the student and the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies. Most graduate students also will have an individual faculty advisor or advising committee, especially after the first year of advanced study. When a student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., the doctoral committee becomes the primary source of academic guidance; however, student academic peti\u00ad tions still must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. Academic Policies The academic policies described in this section of the Cata\u00ad logue apply to students enrolled in study leading to graduate degrees and California education credentials. Other regula\u00ad tions and procedures of importance to graduate students are covered in the Academic Regulations and Enrollment and Other Procedures sections and in the description of each graduate program. Scholastic Requirements A graduate student is expected to make satisfactory progress toward an approved academic objective, as defined by the faculty of the program in accordance with policies of the Graduate Council, and to maintain a satisfactory grade point average for all work undertaken while enrolled in graduate study. Satisfactory progress is determined on the basis of both the recent academic record and overall performance. A graduate student normally is expected to complete satisfac-Graduate Education/Academic Advising 75 torily at least eight units of academic credit applicable to the graduate program in each regular academic session (unless on an approved Leave of Absence), and satisfy all requirements of the academic program according to an approved schedule. For a graduate student, only the grades A, A-, 8+, B, and S represent satisfactory scholarship and may be applied toward advanced degree requirements. However, upon petition, a UCI course in which a grade of B-is earned may be accepted in partial satisfaction of the degree requirements if the stu\u00ad dent has a grade point average of at least 3.0 in all courses applicable to the degree. Graduate students may not apply courses graded Pass or Not Pass toward any degree or satis\u00ad factory progress requirements. A grade point average below the B level (3.0 on a 4.0 scale) is not satisfactory, and a stu\u00ad dent whose grade point average is below that level is subject to academic disqualification. A student's academic progress ordinarily is evaluated on the basis of the academic record. A few weeks after the end of a quarter, an updated copy of each enrolled student's per\u00ad manent academic record is available from the Registrar. This record lists all UCI courses for which a graduate student was enrolled (including courses taken through the Intercampus Exchange Program), the grades assigned, and the cumulative grade point average. Formal candidacy for an advanced degree, degrees conferred, certain examinations passed, unit credit accepted from other institutions, and other important academic information is recorded also. A graduate student who has not demonstrated satisfactory progress is not eligible for any academic appointment, such as Reader, Research Assistant, or Teaching Assistant, and may not hold a fellowship or other award which is based upon academic merit. Grading With the consent of the academic units involved, individual study and research courses at the graduate level may be graded Satisfactory or Unsatisfactory (S/U). Certain graduate courses are graded S/U only, with the approval of the Gradu\u00ad ate Council. A grade of S is equivalent to a grade of B (3.0) or better. No credit is given for a course in which a grade of U was assigned. Graduate students may take one course (up to four units) per quarter on a Pass/Not Pass basis. However, such courses are not considered part of the student's graduate program; may not be applied to the requirements for an advanced degree; and do not count toward the minimum number of units for which a graduate student must enroll. The grade of Incomplete (I) may be assigned by an instructor when the student's work is of passing quality, but is incom\u00ad plete because of circumstances beyond the student's control. Although Incomplete grades do not affect a graduate stu\u00ad dent's grade point average, they are an important factor in evaluating academic progress. The maximum amount of time that an instructor may allow for making up incomplete work is three quarters of enrollment, but stricter limits may be applied. When work is completed within the time allowed, the student should ask the instructor to submit a change of grade notice to the Registrar, ordinarily through the dean of the school in which the course was offered. If not made up within the time allowed, an I grade is recorded permanently. IP On Progress) is a transcript notation restricted to sequen\u00ad tial courses extending over two or more quarters, for which use of the IP notation has been approved. When the last UC IRVINE - 1987-198876 Graduate Education/Policies quarter of the sequence is completed, the grade for the final quarter is assigned for all quarters of the sequence. No credit is given until the student has completed the entire sequence. A student who received an NR (No Report) transcript nota\u00ad tion must immediately contact the instructor and arrange for the removal or replacement of the NR. After one quarter, an NR becomes an F which will remain permanently upon the student's record. A graduate student may repeat once a course in which a grade below B (3.0) or a grade of U was received. Only the most recently earned grade is used in computing the stu\u00ad dent's grade point average for the first eight units of repeated work; thereafter both the earlier and the later grades are used. Additional information about grading may be found in the Academic Regulations section. Academic Disqualification After consultation with the student's academic unit, the Dean of Graduate Studies may disqualify a student who has a grade point average in graduate and upper-division courses below 3.0 for two or more successive quarters; or fails to pass (or does not take) a required examination within the time specified for that graduate program; or does not maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of an approved program of study. Unsatisfactory academic progress may be determined on the basis of explicit requirements, but the professional judgment of the faculty upon review of all graduate work undertaken by the student is paramount. Ordinarily, a student whose work does not meet academic standards will be given written notice and a reasonable period of time in which to make up all deficiencies. Prior to taking final action to disqualify, the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies ordinarily will notify a student who is subject to academic disqualification and will provide reasonable oppor\u00ad tunity for the student to correct erroneous or outdated aca\u00ad demic records, to submit other information or comments in writing, or to request a second review of his or her academic performance. Upon written notice of academic disqualification by the Dean of Graduate Studies, disqualification will be noted on the formal academic record of that student. Following the formal notice of disqualification, the student may appeal to the Dean of Graduate Studies only on the basis of procedural error. Academic Residence A graduate student is considered to be in residence during an academic quarter if at least four units of academic credit are earned in regular upper-division or graduate courses. Credit for one academic quarter of residence may be earned by com\u00ad pleting at least two units of credit in approved courses in each of two Summer Sessions. In the case of Ph.D. students, these must be consecutive sessions. Enrollment Policy Full-time academic enrollment ordinarily is expected of grad\u00ad uate students at the University of California. Full-time study is defined as enrollment in at least 12 units of upper-division or graduate academic credit per quarter, including credit for supervised research or teaching. Graduate students may enroll in lower-division courses with the approval of their academic advisors, but such courses are not considered to be part of any graduate program. Graduate students ordinarily may not receive credit for more than 12 units per quarter in graduate courses, or 16 units in upper-division courses, or a proportionate number in combi\u00ad nation. Course loads in excess of 16 units must be approved in advance by both the student's Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. Although in most instances completion of an advanced degree at UCI requires full-time study, the University recog\u00ad nizes the legitimate need for part-time study opportunities and is committed to increasing those opportunities wherever possible. Graduate degree programs may be opened to part\u00ad time students wherever good educational reasons exist for so doing. Under this policy, part-time enrollment at the graduate level is defined as enrollment for eight units or less, including enrollment in Physical Education classes. Within the guide\u00ad lines and limitations on the application form available in the Office of Research and Graduate Studies, graduate students may petition for part-time status and, if the petition is approved, shall pay the full University Registration Fee and student activities fees, one-half the Educational Fee, and one\u00ad half the Nonresident Tuition Fee (if applicable). Continuous Registration A graduate student is expected to enroll for each regular aca\u00ad demic session (fall, winter, and spring quarters) until all requirements for an advanced degree or credential have been completed, including final examinations and the submission of an approved thesis or dissertation. Enrollment is not offi\u00ad cial until all required fees have been paid and the student's Enrollment in Classes Petition is completed correctly, signed where necessary, and submitted to the Registrar. Students are responsible for ensuring that their course enrollment is correct. For more information, see the Enrollment and Other Procedures section. A student engaged in study or research outside the State of California for an entire quarter ordinarily will register in absentia. Unless an official Leave of Absence has been granted, or a petition to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of registra\u00ad tion has been approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies, a student who does not register by the final deadlines for any regular quarter will lose graduate standing, and candidacy for any advanced degree will lapse. Prior to resuming graduate study in the University, a former student must successfully apply for readmission. A readmitted student must register and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree. A degree can\u00ad not be conferred earlier than the second quarter following readmission. A graduate student who decides to leave the University after enrolling and paying fees for a quarter must file an official Notice of Withdrawal or Cancellation with the Dean of Graduate Studies. A graduate student in good academic standing who withdraws from graduate study and intends to return within one year may submit an application for a Leave of Absence. If the leave is approved, the student remains in good standing and need not apply for readmission in order to enroll at the expiration of the leave period. Leave of Absence A graduate student who withdraws from the University with the intention of returning within one year and wishes to avoid a lapse of student status should request a Leave of Absence. A Leave of Absence of up to one year's duration UC IRVINE - 1987-1988may be granted by the Dean of Graduate Studies upon the recommendation of the student's academic unit, subject to the following guidelines: 1. The student must have completed satisfactorily at least one quarter in residence and be in good academic standing. The leave must be consistent with the student's academic objectives. 2. Leave ordinarily is approved in cases of serious illness or other temporary disability, or temporary interruption of the student's academic program for other appropriate reasons. 3. A student on leave is not eligible for assistance from a University fellowship, research grant, or financial aid pro\u00ad gram, and may not hold an academic appointment or compar\u00ad able University employment. During a period of leave, a stu\u00ad dent may not take comprehensive or qualifying examinations or earn academic credit (except by a transfer of credit from another institution approved in advance by the Dean of Graduate Studies). Leave may not be granted to students who intend to make use of most University resources or facil\u00ad ities (including housing), and it may be revoked if they do so. 4. A student failing to register for the next regular academic session following the expiration of leave will lose graduate standing and will be subject to the following readmission policy. Readmission A student who previously withdrew from the University, or whose student status has lapsed, may request readmission to graduate study by submitting an Application for Readmission with a $35 fee, which is nonrefundable. The Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies may grant readmission when recommended by the academic unit. If readmitted, a student's previous aca\u00ad demic work will be applied toward the requirements for an advanced degree only with the approval of the Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. A readmitted student must satisfy the academic requirements in effect at the time of readmission and may be required to satisfy cer\u00ad tain requirements a second time, including those for formal advancement to candidacy. A readmitted student must regis\u00ad ter and then be advanced or reinstated to candidacy at least one quarter before receiving an advanced degree, which will be conferred no earlier than the second quarter following readmission. Intercampus Exchange Program A graduate student in good standing who wishes to take advantage of educational opportunities available only at another campus of the University of California may do so through the Intercampus Exchange Program. Ordinarily, an exchange student will have demonstrated a high level of scholarship during at least one year of graduate study at the home campus and will have well-defined academic objectives. Approval of the faculty advisor, the host department(s), and the respective Deans of Graduate Studies is required. Direct arrangements between faculty members on the two cam\u00ad puses are encouraged so as to ensure that courses, seminars, or facilities will be available to meet the participating stu\u00ad dent's needs. Students may take courses on more than one campus of the University in the same academic session. The exchange student enrolls and pays fees on the home campus and then enrolls at the host campus, following the procedures of that Registrar's Office. A report of academic work completed will be transferred to the student's academic record on the home campus. Although eligible for all normal student services, the exchange student is a visitor and is not formally admitted to graduate study at the host campus. Graduate Education/Policies 77 Attendance at Anteater basketball home games tripled following the opening of the Donald Bren Events Center in early 1987. Application forms for the Intercampus Exchange Program may be obtained from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies and should be filed with the Office at least four weeks before the beginning of the quarter in order to avoid penalties for late filing of the study list. Transfers of Credit At least one-half of the course requirement for a master's degree must be completed while in residence as a graduate student at UCI. Credit for up to one-fifth of the minimum number of units required for a master's degree may be allowed for graduate-level work completed at another institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension prior to first graduate enrollment at UCI. Such courses do not count toward the required number of units in 200-series courses. Up to one\u00ad half the units required may be accepted from another Gradu\u00ad ate Division of the University of California. After enroll\u00ad ment, the student must initiate a formal petition for such credit. The acceptance of unit credit earned in another pro\u00ad gram must be recommended by the academic unit to which the student has been admitted and be approved by the Dean of Graduate Studies. No units of transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B (3.0) or equivalent was assigned. Under no circumstances will grade credit be transferred. A student currently enrolled in a master's degree program or on a Leave of Absence may receive unit credit (not grade credit) for graduate-level work completed at another institu\u00ad tion or through University Extension only with the prior approval of the departmental Graduate Advisor and the Dean of Graduate Studies. No transfer credit will be given for any course in which a grade below B or equivalent was assign_ed. A student who begins graduate study at UCI in the fall quar\u00ad ter will receive appropriate credit for courses taken in preced\u00ad ing UCI Summer Sessions, provided that the formal date of admission precedes Summer Session enrollment. Continuing graduate students will receive credit for courses taken in intervening UCI Summer Sessions. UC IRVINE - 1987-198878 Graduate Education/Degrees Graduate Degrees Master's Degrees The master's degree is conferred at the end of the academic quarter in which all requirements have been satisfied, subject to the final approval of the Graduate Council. The student must be advanced to candidacy for the degree prior to the beginning of the final quarter of enrollment. Therefore, an application for advancement to candidacy, initiated by the student and approved by the academic unit, should be sub\u00ad mitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies at least 30 days before the opening of the quarter in which the degree is expected. The Master of Arts (M.A.) or Master of Science (M.S.) degree normally is attained by one of two routes: Plan I, a thesis; or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. Both require a minimum of one year in residence, satisfactory completion of prescribed course work, and an appropriate demonstration of achievement. Plan I includes a minimum of seven courses (28 units), 20 units or more of which must be at the graduate level; a thesis; and a general examination. Plan II requires at least nine courses (36 units), including 24 units or more at the graduate level, and a comprehensive examination cover\u00ad ing a broad range of subject matter in the discipline. Only approved 200-series courses completed while in residence at the University satisfy the minimum graduate course requirement. Some programs will have course requirements exceeding the minimums cited above and may have additional or alternative degree requirements. Please refer to the de\u00ad scription of the specific program for more information. Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) degrees are awarded by the School of Fine Arts (M.F.A. in Fine Arts or Drama) and by the Program in Writing (M.F.A. in English) upon successful completion of the equivalent of two years or more of full\u00ad time study with an emphasis upon creative expression and professional development. Special thesis or comprehensive examination requirements are established for these programs. Master of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.) degrees are awarded upon successful completion of programs designed for the professional development of secondary school teachers and college instructors. A minimum of one year in residence is required, usually including Summer Session course work. A thesis project or other comparable evidence of professional attainment is part of each M.A.T. program. Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) degrees are awarded by the Graduate School of Management upon suc\u00ad cessful completion of the equivalent of two years of full-time study in the development of professional managerial skills. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree is awarded on the basis of evidence that the recipient possesses knowledge of a broad field of learning and expert mastery of a particular area of concentration within it. The research dissertation is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intellectual syn\u00ad thesis, creativity, and skill in written communication. The candidate for the Ph.D. is expected to be in full-time res\u00ad idence for at least six regular academic quarters. Four to six years of full-time academic work beyond the bachelor's degree typically is required to complete the degree. At the end of the first year or so of full-time study, many programs administer a preliminary examination on the student's mas\u00ad tery of fundamental knowledge in the discipline. Upon suc\u00ad cessfully demonstrating a high level of scholarship on this examination and after further study, the student will con-tinue to a series of qualifying examinations which lead to formal advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. Graduate students ordinarily attain candidacy status for the Ph.D. degree when all preparatory work has been completed, when qualifying examinations have been passed, and when they are ready for the dissertation phase. Students are recommended for advancement to candidacy by unanimous vote of the candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies on behalf of the Graduate Council. The proposed candidacy committee list must be submitted to the Office of Research and Graduate Studies (on the Ph.D. Form I) at least two weeks before the final qualifying examination is to be given, so that formal appointment can be made before the examination date. The Report on Qualifying Examination for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Form II) must be signed by the committee at the time the candidacy examination is concluded and submitted to the Dean of Graduate Studies. Following a unanimous favorable vote of the committee, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon payment of the $25 Candidacy Fee. Candidacy for the Ph.D. will lapse automatically if the student loses graduate standing by academic disqualification or failure to comply with the University policy on continuous registration. A readmitted student who was a candidate for the Ph.D. must again advance to candidacy and thereafter enroll as a candi\u00ad date for at least one academic quarter before the Ph.D. may be conferred. Following advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D., a doctoral committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies (on behalf of the Graduate' Council) supervises the student's pro\u00ad gram, approves the dissertation, and conducts the final oral examination if required. The chair of the doctoral committee is the member of the faculty responsible for providing prim\u00ad ary guidance of the student's dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will be given just prior to completion of the dissertation and while the student is in residence during a regular academic session, and will be open to all members of the academic community. Ph.D. degrees are conferred, sub\u00ad ject to the final approval of the Graduate Council, as of the last day of the regular academic quarter in which all require\u00ad ments have been satisfied. The In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant By action of each academic unit, the Graduate Council, and the Academic Senate Coordinating Committee on Graduate Affairs, a Normative Time has been established for each Ph.D. program. This is the expected number of 12-month years from first enrollment to completion of the Ph.D. for students entering with normal preparation who are able to study without serious interruptions. The Normative Time established for UCI Ph.D. programs is five years in all fields except (years in parentheses): Administration (six), Anatomy and Neurobiology (four), Classics (six), Comparative Culture (six), Comparative Literature (six), English (six), French (six), German (six), History (six), Philosophy (six), Physics (six), Social Ecology (six), Spanish (six). A Ph.D. student in good standing will be eligible for a quar\u00ad terly grant equal to the Educational Fee if: 1. the student is a formal candidate for the Ph.D., as of the first day of the quarter; 2. the student's accrued time since first enrollment is less than the Normative Time for completion of the Ph.D. estab\u00ad lished for that graduate program (accrued time is equal to elapsed time from first enrollment as a UCI graduate student less (a) up to three quarters of approved leave, and (b) any time between completion of a graduate program or formal withdrawal and readmission in a different field of study); UC IRVINE - 1987-19883. the student is not entitled to payment of the Educational Fee from an extramural fellowship, grant, or traineeship; and 4. satisfactory academic progress has been certified by the Graduate Advisor. Additional information about the In-Candidacy Fee Offset Grant program and application forms are available from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Theses and Dissertations Candidates for the Ph.D. and certain master's degrees must conduct an extensive research project and submit a thesis or dissertation in order to fulfill degree requirements. Research expenses are not supported by the University, and the cost of preparing the thesis or dissertation ordinarily ranges from $200 to $1,000, but may be considerably more. Soon after advancement to candidacy, those Ph.D. or mas\u00ad ter's candidates who are writing a thesis or.dissertation should consult with the Manuscript Advisor in the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. The Manuscript Advisor has the responsibility of ensuring that the established procedures and standards of UCI are upheld in the preparation of theses and dissertations. After approval by the doctoral or thesis committee appointed for each candidate by the Graduate Council, a copy of the dissertation (two copies of a master's thesis) must be filed with the Manuscript Advisor for place\u00ad ment in the UCI Library. The final copy must meet the Uni\u00ad versity's requirements for style, format, and appearance before the degree can be conferred. Dissertations and theses must be filed no later than the end of the eighth week of instruction in order for them to be reviewed and accepted in time for the degree to be conferred in that quarter. The Filing Fee Under certain circumstances, a student may be eligible to pay a Filing Fee equal to half of the Registration Fee in lieu of reg\u00ad istration, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. In general, all requirements for a degree must have been satisfied prior to the start of the quarter, except for the submission of the final version of the dissertation or thesis, or the completion of a final oral or comprehensive examina\u00ad tion. The student who intends to make use of any University resource, to hold any academic appointment or comparable University employment, or to receive any student service for which official registration and payment of regular fees is a requirement is not eligible to pay the Filing Fee in lieu of reg\u00ad istration. A Filing Fee will not be accepted immediately fol\u00ad lowing readmission and will be accepted immediately follow\u00ad ing a Leave of Absence only under exceptional circumstances. The date for payment of the Filing Fee without a late service fee is the same as that for the payment of other student fees. If all degree requirements are not completed during the quar\u00ad ter in which the Filing Fee is paid, the student must subse\u00ad quently register and pay all applicable fees. Conferral of Graduate Degrees Prior to the beginning of the quarter in which an advanced degree is to be conferred, the student must have advanced to candidacy for that degree and should have received formal notice confirming candidacy from the Dean of Graduate Stu\u00ad dies. The student should consult the departmental Graduate Advisor to determine which degree requirements, if any, have not yet been satisfied. \u00b7 No later than the beginning of the final quarter, the student should file a Diploma Information form with the Office of Research and Graduate Studies: If a master's thesis or doc\u00ad toral dissertation is to be submitted, the Manuscript Advisor Graduate Education/Financial Assistance 79 should be consulted well in advance about the final format and the deadline for submission of the approved manuscript. Students are advised by mail when their diplomas are avail\u00ad able, which is approximately six months after the quarter in which the degrees are awarded. Financial Assistance for Graduate Students Several types of financial assistance are available to graduate students at UCI. These include fellowships, teaching and research assistantships, tuition fellowships for nonresident students, grants-in-aid, student loans, and Work-Study. Applicants interested in assistantships or fellowships should so indicate on their application when applying for admission. For all graduate programs, applications should be completed by January 1 to receive full consideration for fellowship and assistantship awards. Continuing students interested in an assistantship or fellowship should contact the Graduate Advisor for their program. The awarding of fellowships for the following academic year will be made during the month of April. The University of California, Irvine subscribes to the agree\u00ad ment of the Council of Graduate Schools of the United States, under which successful applicants for awards of financial support are given until April 15 to accept or decline such awards. An award accepted from one of the member universities may be resigned at any time through April 15. However, an acceptance given or left in force after that date commits the student to not accepting another appointment without first obtaining formal release for that purpose from the awarding institution. Regents', Regents' Irvine, and UCI Chancellor's Fellowships will be awarded to a number of promising students entering graduate study at UCI leading to the Doctor of Philosophy or Master of Fine Arts degree. Awards include a stipend, all required student fees, and, if applicable, Nonresident Tuition. Other fellowships are offered, including tuition awards for outstanding applicants who are not residents of California. In many cases, fellowship stipends may be supplemented by par\u00ad tial assistantship appointments. Entering or continuing graduate students may be awarded research or teaching assistantships for all or part of the aca\u00ad demic year. The types of assistantships, number available, and required duties vary according to the activities of the academic unit. Neither assistantship includes remission of fees or tuition, but a graduate assistant who is not a Califor\u00ad nia resident also may receive a tuition fellowship. Through the Graduate and Professional Opportunity Pro\u00ad gram, a number of fellowships and assistantships are awarded to first-and second-year graduate students from groups including minorities and women in certain fields who traditionally have been underrepresented in higher education in the United States. All fellowship awards and assistantships appointments are made in accordance with the affirmative action policies of the University. Grants for doctoral research and a limited number of disser\u00ad tation fellowships are awarded each year; additional informa\u00ad tion is available from the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. The Office also provides information and assistance to students who wish to apply for fellowships from federal agencies, foundations, and other non-University sources. The Expenses and Fees and Financial Aid sections contain information about assistance based upon financial need that is administered by the Financial Aid Office, including grants, loans, and Work-Study awards. A Financial Aid Handbook is available from the Financial Aid Office. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I Schools and Departments School of Biological Sciences Albert F. Bennett Acting Dean Daniel G.

Yahr, Ph.D. University of Texas, Professor of Psychobiology No one can predict the future, but this much is known: the next quarter century is the time of the biologist, who will be in the midst of many of the activities that govern major aspects of life. These include some of the most challenging intellectual problems, such as the mechanisms of memory and of learning, the molecular basis of embryonic develop\u00ad ment, and the rules that help predict the behavior of the environment. Biology also lies at the heart of major social problems that face mankind in the coming decade, such as sensible management of the environment and the effective control of human populations. It is vital that educated men and women understand the contributions that biological sci\u00ad ences have made and will continue to make for the future welfare of mankind. The School of Biological Sciences reflects new concepts of biology in both its curriculum and its research programs. The faculty is dedicated to providing students with the opportun\u00ad ity to avail themselves of the principles and ever-increasing knowledge of biology. The curriculum is designed to meet present and future educational needs of majors and nonma\u00ad jors. In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, the School encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. It strongly believes that excellence in research is essential for effective, enthusiastic, and up-to-date teaching. The School provides an excellent opportunity for undergrad\u00ad uates to participate in research, through the Biological Sci\u00ad ences 199 program. Each quarter nearly 350 undergraduate students and 200 graduate and postdoctoral students partici\u00ad pate in independent research programs. In addition to the regular University requirements for admis\u00ad sion, students interested in the biological sciences should include in their high school curriculum, in addition to a course in biology, four years of mathematics, as well as courses in chemistry and physics, which are now an integral part of most contemporary biological work. The biological sciences are presented as an integrated area of study through the eight-quarter Biological Sciences Core, with lectures and laboratories developing the major concepts of modern biology. Satellite courses expand upon and inten\u00ad sify areas covered in the Core and provide students with the opportunity to specialize in a particular area of the biological sciences. In addition to the regular major in Biological Scien- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988ces, a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, also leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, is available at the undergraduate level. The degree requirements of these two programs are similar, with the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology placing a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Introductory courses for nonmajors are designed to make the biological sciences mean\u00ad ingful and interesting and to inform intelligent citizens of bio\u00ad logical phenomena that affect their daily lives. Graduate courses are offered in all the departments. Students with an interest in the application of ecology to human needs may choose the Applied Ecology major, leading to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology, which is offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. See page 251. Degrees Biological Sciences ...................... B.S., M.S., Ph.D. A concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is available at the undergraduate level. Opportunities are avail\u00ad able at the graduate level to specialize in developmental and cell biology, ecology and evolutionary biology, molecular biol\u00ad ogy and biochemistry, psychobiology, anatomy and neurobi\u00ad ology, microbiology and molecular genetics, and physiology and biophysics. Applied Ecology (offered joir;ttly with the Program in Social Ecology) ....................... B.A. Honors Graduation with Honors. Of the graduating seniors, approx\u00ad imately 12 percent may receive honors: 1 percent summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. The selection for these awards is based on winter quarter rank-ordered grade point averages.

Degree in Biological Sciences University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements Biological Sciences Core Curriculum (90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, 105, 105L, 106, 106L, 107); 5A-B-C, 5LA-LB-LC; and Humanities 1A-B-C, or another option of the lower\u00ad division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humani\u00ad ties or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must have a 2.0 cumulative grade point average in the Biological Sciences Core Curriculum and three satellite courses. In addition to the listed Biological Sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and Physics 18A-B-C can be used to satisfy the satellite requirement. Students with a double major in Psychology and Biological Sciences can also use Psychology 151A-B-C to satisfy the satellite requirement. No student may enter as a double major, but students inter\u00ad ested in other areas may possibly become double majors after the first quarter, if the second school or program approves. A strong academic performance in the second area is requisite for acceptance as a double major. For information on requirements for the B.S. degree in Bio\u00ad logical Sciences with a concentration in Ecology and Envi\u00ad ronmental Biology, see page 85. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 84 Biological Sciences UCI Breadth Requirement Those students majoring in Biological Sciences who have completed the School requirements and who have passed any two quarters of the writing component of the Humanities Core or its alternative with a grade of C or better will have satisfied the UCI breadth requirement, with two exceptions: the upper-division writing requirement and Category III, Social and Behavioral Sciences. Specifically, the Humanities Core or its alternative satisfies Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry; it also satisfies the lower\u00ad division writing requirement when two quarters of the writ\u00ad ing component are passed with a grade of Cor better. Chem\u00ad istry and physics satisfy Category II, Natural Sciences. Cate\u00ad gory V, Foreign Language, Linguistics, Logic, Mathematics, Computer Science, is satisfied by completion of the School mathematics requirement. Planning a Program of Study Since biological sciences courses are built upon a base of the physical sciences, it is important for students to take their required physical sciences early. The academic program shown below is only a suggested program. Students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for individual academic planning. Freshmen will normally take eight units of the humanities requirement, Chemistry lA, and a freshman seminar (Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences 2) during the fall quarter. Students with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics part of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may enroll in mathematics during the fall quarter and should note the prerequisites for Mathemat\u00ad ics 2A. During their freshman year, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sciences 90. Sophomores begin organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA), con\u00ad tinue the Biological Sciences Core, and complete the Humani\u00ad ties requirement if they have not taken it during their fresh\u00ad man year. Sophomores often begin taking courses in other schools to meet the UCI breadth requirement and fulfill their Sample Program -Biological Sciences Fall Winter Spring Freshman Chern. lA Human. IA Bio. 2 (Fr. Sem.) Math 2Ab Bio. Sci. 90 Chern. IB, IB Sophomore 3B, LB Bio. Core Chern. SIC mathematics requirement if they have not done so as fresh\u00ad men. Sophomores who have completed the mathematics requirement as freshmen may enroll in physics. Students who intend to double major in Chemistry may be required to take Physics SA-B-C in place of Physics 3A-B-C. During their junior year, most majors continue the Biological Sciences Core and take physics if they have not yet done so. Juniors complete their breadth requirements and often become involved in the satellite course requirements. Since most satellites are based upon material contained in the Core, it is usually preferable for students to have completed most of the Core before taking satellite courses. Finally, during their senior year, students complete the Core and may become involved in an area of specialization within the School. Individualized accelerated programs of study are designed for students entering the School with strong backgrounds in biology. Please see page 86 for details regarding the Fresh\u00ad man Honors Curriculum. A special program of study should be considered by students who enter the biological sciences with a weak background in the sciences and in writing skills. A weak background might consist of not completing high school chemistry or mathe\u00ad matics through trigonometry, and not satisfying the Subject A requirement before entering the University. This program allows a student to gain the necessary background skills and may require five years of study at the undergraduate level. Before beginning this program of study, students must see an academic counselor in the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Freshmen should complete English and Comparative Litera\u00ad ture WR39A, Mathematics 1, Biological Sciences 2, and an additional humanities course (to satisfy the alternative to the Humanities Core) during the fall quarter. The winter quarter should include Chemistry 10 and continuation of humanities and mathematics. Continuation of humanities and mathemat\u00ad ics, and an elective, are taken during the spring quarter.

Normally students must satisfy the Subject A requirement prior to fulfilling the lower-division writing requirement. Students taking Humanities lA must also enroll in Writing Workshop (2 .;nits) if they have not satisfied the Subject A requirement. bstudents with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may begin mathematics as freshmen. Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics portion of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. Please note the prerequisites for Mathematics 2A. cStudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB-LC in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirement in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. Physics 3A-B-C is the course for nonmajors and is fully acceptable for a degree in the Biological Sciences. Physics 5A-B-C, which begins in the winter quarter, better prepares a student for Physical Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C and for some graduate schools. dElectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: UCI breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. eln addition to the listed biological sciences satellite courses, Chemistry 130A-B-C or 131A-B-C, Physics lSA-B-C, and Psychology 151A-B-C (for Biological Sciences/Psychology double majors) are counted as satellites. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988During the second year, students should begin general chem\u00ad istry (Chemistry lA-B-C), continue working on the breadth requirement and any remaining humanities requirements, and complete mathematics. During winter quarter, students will begin the Biological Sciences Core with Biological Sci\u00ad ences 90. The Biological Sciences Core, organic chemistry (Chemistry SlA-B-C), and elective courses should be taken during the third year. The fourth year should include Physics 3A-B-C, continuation of the Biological Sciences Core, biological sciences satellites, and possibly research or other electives. The fifth year should be relatively free to explore additional satellites and research and to complete any remaining Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences Core Courses. Requirements for the B.S. Degree in Biological Sciences with a Concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology The School of Biological Sciences offers a concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology which provides a second pathway to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences. The concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology differs from the regular undergraduate program in having a greater emphasis on ecology and the natural sciences and a lesser emphasis on chemistry and molecular biology. Its principal objective is to afford the student an integrated, interdiscipli\u00ad nary program in environmental studies within the frame\u00ad work of a broad and rigorous physical and biological sciences background. A vital goal is to allow the student completing the cours~ of study to be broadly trained as a biologist, with the breadth of educational experience to view environmental problems from an informed ecologist's perspective. In addi\u00ad tion to completing basic required courses in the humanities and the physical and biological sciences, the student must complete a core of environmentally based courses from the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Pro\u00ad gram in Social Ecology, and the School of Engineering. Expo\u00ad sure to current thought in several subareas of ecology is emphasized, and the acquisition of elementary statistical and computer skills is stressed. Opportunities to specialize in sev-Biological Sciences 85 eral general study areas are furnished. Students will study theoretical concepts and experimental relationships in terres\u00ad trial or aquatic systems through Ecology and Evolutionary Biology satellite courses, but may also choose to specialize in the demographic and planning aspects of environmental management through classes in Social Ecology, or the techno\u00ad logical approach to environmental problem solving through advanced course work in Environmental Engineering. Students should investigate the Applied Ecology major (p. 2Sl), offered jointly by the School of Biological Sciences and the Program in Social Ecology. The Applied Ecology major emphasizes ecology as it pertains to human needs, whereas the concentration in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology emphasizes ecology as a basic science. University Requirements: See pages 48-SO. School Requirements Biological Sciences 90, 101, 102, 103, 103L, 104, 104L, lOS, 106, 106L, 120, 166, 174, and either 169 or 179; Chemistry lA-B-C, SlA-B and lLB-LC, SlLA-LB; Information and Computer 2A-B and one quarter statistics; Physics 3A-B-C, 3LA-LB-LC; one of the following courses: or ME164, Social Ecology E12S, ElS6A, one lA-B-C, or another option of the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth require\u00ad ment (Category I) and a three-quarter sequence in either Humanities or Literature (Category IV, Humanistic Inquiry). Students must attain a 2.0 grade point average in required Biological Sciences courses. Planning a Program of Study A normal program of study for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology is similar to that for the regular Biological Sciences major.

(See School requirements for regular Biological Sci\u00ad ences majors and footnote \"a\" from the Sample Program for regular Biological Sciences majors.) bstudents with a score of 650 or higher on the mathematics section of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) may begin mathematics as freshmen. Students with a score below 650 on the mathematics section of the SAT should defer mathematics to their sophomore year. cstudents who have completed mathematics in their freshman year may take Physics 3A-B-C and 3LA-LB-LC in their sophomore year. Students who take the mathematics requirements in their sophomore year should defer physics to their junior year. dElectives should be chosen with the following purposes in mind: breadth requirements; students' own breadth; preprofessional training. eRequired electives are Biological Sciences 174 or 186, Biological Sciences 169 or 179, and two courses from among various Engineering and Social Ecology courses. See School requirements for the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 86 Biological Sciences 120. In addition, required electives in biological sciences, engineering; and social ecology replace the requirement for three satellite courses. The UCI breadth requirement may be satisfied in the concen\u00ad tration in Ecology and Environmental Biology in the same manner as the regular Biological Sciences major. Further clarification on the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology may be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Special Programs and Courses Freshman Honors Curriculum Individually accelerated programs of study can be designed for freshman students who enter the School of Biological Sciences with strong backgrounds in biology and who have achieved scores of 4 or 5 in the biology section of the Advanced Placement Examination. Such freshmen are exempt from the first course in the Biological Sciences Core (Biological Sciences 90, Diversity of Life) and begin the second Core course (Biological Sciences 101, Evolutionary Biology and Genetics) during the fall quarter of their first year. This program enables participants to complete the fourth Core course by the end of their first year. Any stu\u00ad dent with such Advanced Placement credit should contact the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for more informa\u00ad tion regarding this program. Biological Sciences 199 Every undergraduate student in the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences has the opportunity to pursue independent experimen\u00ad tal laboratory or field research under the direct supervision of a professor in the School of Biological Sciences or in the UCI-California College of Medicine as an apprentice scientist. Under the guidance of a senior scientist, the student is able to experience the challenge and excitement of the world of sci\u00ad ence and to develop new scientific skills. This activity may commence as early as the sophomore year or, in the case of exceptional students, earlier. Interested students should investigate the possibilities for research early in order to obtain a great deal of research experience, if they so desire, before they graduate. Although the School of Biological Sciences does not require training in a foreign language, some areas of research demand that stu\u00ad dents possess foreign language skills. Students are, therefore, encouraged to discuss foreign language needs with their advisors to see if such training is important for their own careers. Advising for research careers in the biological sci\u00ad ences is best accomplished by students working together with a faculty advisor. Excellence in Research Program The School of Biological Sciences believes that successful par\u00ad ticipation in creative research is one of the highest academic goals its undergraduates can attain and accordingly rewards such students with Excellence in Biological Sciences Research certificates. Through undergraduate research and the Excel\u00ad lence in Research Program in Biological Sciences, students have the opportunity of presenting the results of their research endeavors to peers and faculty, and possibly of see\u00ad ing their research papers published. Selected papers are pub\u00ad lished in the School's Journal of Undergraduate Research in the Biological Sciences. All Biological Sciences majors doing experimental research under Biological Sciences 199 who have completed a min\u00ad imum of three quarters on the same project (with at least one quarter taken during the academic year of the symposium) are eligible to participate. They must be in good academic standing, have a grade point average of 2.7 or better, and be making normal progress in Biological Sciences. Ecology Super Course During one quarter of each academic year (usually either winter or spring), several courses are combined into a Super Course. Such courses include Biological Sciences 167 (Field Botany), 181 (Advanced Marine Ecology), 184 (Insect Ecol\u00ad ogy), and 189 (Ecological Energetics). These courses, together with a Biological Sciences 199 (Independent Study in Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences Research), constitute the student's entire curricu\u00ad lum for that particular quarter. (During any quarter in which the Super Course is taught, students may not enroll in part of the Super Course requirements individually.) Extensive fieldwork is involved. Enrollment is limited to 20 students, with selection based upon application and an interview at the end of the preceding quarter. Prerequisites are completion of Biological Sciences 102 and consent of instructor. Undergraduate Teaching Opportunities Through the Tutoring Program, students can immediately put to practice skills they have learned in their biology train\u00ad ing. This program provides opportunities for students to develop teaching abilities and to perform a worthwhile and necessary service. In the Tutoring Program, UCI students tutor other UCI students in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in Business Administration (M.B.A.) along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum overall grade point average required is 3.2. Com\u00ad pletion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful com\u00ad pletion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact their academic counselors. Special Research Resources Special research resources include the Beckman Laser Insti\u00ad tute and Medical Clinic, a research, training, and service facil\u00ad ity in the area of laser microbeam technology; the School of Biological Sciences Biohazard (P-3) Facility, which provides laboratory facilities for working with biological agents or bio\u00ad logical molecules such as recombinant DNA which would be hazardous when used in open laboratories; the Museum of Systematic Biology, a teaching and research facility which currently contains material on local populations of plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates; the Developmental Biology Center, devoted to analyzing the cellular and genetic mecha\u00ad nisms underlying growth, development, and regeneration; the Center for the Neurobiology of Learning and Memory, a research center for studies of the brain mechanisms underly\u00ad ing learning and memory; the UCI Arboretum, a botanical garden facility; the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve, UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Biological Sciences 87 Each 4uarier nearly 350 undergraduates and 200 graduate and post-doctoral Biological Sciences students participate in independent research programs. which supports controlled marsh biota; the Burns Pinon Ridge Reserve, a high-desert habitat in San Bernardino County; the Theoretical Neurobiology Facility, which pro\u00ad physiologically of neuronal systems; and the UCI Ecological Pre\u00ad serve, which includes coastal hills on the campus, once under heavy grazing, but now returning to a more natural state. It is important to note that the School has access to the UCI\u00ad California College of Medicine, thereby providing an oppor\u00ad tunity for the sharing of both teaching and research activities. Advising: Academic, Career, Health Sciences Academic Advising The Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office coordinates the advising program and provides academic counseling as well as special services particularly in the area of preprofes\u00ad sional career counseling. Undergraduate Biological Sciences students should consult the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office for information on academic requirements for the degree, career opportunities, the Biological Sciences 199 Research Program, available tutoring for Biological Sciences courses, Biological Sciences student organizations, and schol\u00ad arship information. Students can also come to the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office to change a grade, change their major, apply for graduation, or for any other help they might need related to their academic career at UCI. All freshmen will enroll in small-group freshman seminars (Biological Sciences 2) and all other new students will enroll in special sections of Biological Sciences 190. Upper-division peer advisors are actively involved in these seminars. Peer Academic Advisors. The Peer Academic Advisors are upper-division Biological Sciences majors who bring with them valuable academic and social experiences. Their func\u00ad tions include counseling students in matters of major selec\u00ad tion, program planning, petitioning, tutoring, learning skills problems, and participation in cocurricular and extracurricu\u00ad lar activities. The Peer Advisors are located in the Biological Sciences Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. Office hours are posted at the beginning of each quarter. Career Advising Information on graduate and professional schools in the health sciences can be obtained from the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Additional career information and job opportunities are available through the UCI Career Planning and Placement Center (CPPC). The Student Affairs Office has developed a complete career library and a close relation\u00ad ship with the CPPC in an effort to provide current, relevant career information for biology students. Special events designed to provide career information are the annual Biolog\u00ad ical Sciences Career Fair and monthly career workshops, many of which are cosponsored by the Student Affairs Office and the CPPC. Areas of opportunity open to those with a Bachelor of Sci\u00ad ence degree include laboratory technology, publishing, tech\u00ad nical editing, pharmaceutical sales, and training programs in county, state, and federal agencies. The bachelor's degree is necessary to pursue studies leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees. A B.S. degree, plus short training periods, may prepare stu\u00ad dents for employment in education, medical technology (usu\u00ad ally one year), physical therapy, and various other areas. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 88 Biological Sciences Education (community colleges, state colleges, or private schools), medical illustration, and public health (which includes hospital administration, biostatistics, epidemiology, environmental health sciences, social work, public health education, maternal and child health, and infectious and trop\u00ad ical diseases) are fields in which opportunities are available upon completion of a Master's program. The Ph.D. degree may lead to research in many areas, among them biochemistry, biorneteorology, botany, cytology, ecology, fishery biology, genetics, horne economics, microbiology, molecular biology, pathology, physiology, psychobiology, pub\u00ad lic health, range management, soil conservation, and zoology. Other areas where advanced degrees are necessary include medicine, dentistry, law, optometry, podiatry, osteopathy, and veterinary medicine. Health Sciences Advising Advising for careers in the health sciences is a specialty of the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Students desiring to enter the health sciences should have their programs checked in the Office. They also should check deadlines for taking the New Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) or other required tests and application deadlines. The New MCAT and the Dental Admission Test, required by most medical and dental schools, are administered in spring and fall each year on the Irvine campus. These tests should be taken in the spring, a year and one-half before the student plans to enter medical or dental school. Many Biological Sciences students desire a career related to their education in the biological sciences. Students can go into medicine, dentistry, optometry, osteopathy, podiatry, veterinary medicine, and related medical fields; into teaching; and into research in the biological sciences. In properly pre\u00ad paring for such careers, planning is essential early in a stu\u00ad dent's education. Leaders in dental, medical, and veterinary education recom\u00ad mend that students preparing to seek admission to their schools plan to obtain a bachelor's degree. Students who plan to enter a school of dentistry, medicine, or other areas of the health sciences may receive the required preprofessional training on the Irvine campus. This preprofessional training may be accomplished by (I) completing the major in Biological Sciences or (2) majoring in any school or department and ful\u00ad filling concurrently the specific course requirements of the dental, medical, or other professional school the student expects to attend. Students interested in the health sciences should choose elec\u00ad tives in the social sciences, possibly a foreign language, physi\u00ad cal chemistry, or other specific courses required or recom\u00ad mended by graduate schools. Health Sciences Advisory Committee The Health Sciences Advisory Committee consists of faculty and academic counselors in the School of Biological Sciences. The Committee offers specialized services, for a fee, to all students applying to postgraduate professional schools in the health sciences, including (I) a Committee interview and let\u00ad ter of recommendation for most professional school applica\u00ad tions, (2) a personal file containing the student's letters of recommendation, and (3) a service of sending all recommen\u00ad dations for a student to professional and graduate schools. Student Participation AED. Alpha Epsilon Delta (AED) is an international honor society for students preparing for careers in the health pro\u00ad fessions. AED strives to stimulate an appreciation of health careers through interaction among prehealth students, health educators, and practitioners in a variety of health care fields. AED annually sponsors workshops on interview techniques and a series of talks on selecting, applying to, and financing medical school. Blood drives, sponsored by AED and offered in conjunction with the UCI Medical Center and the Student Health Center, take place twice per quarter, while guest speakers from every aspect of the health care field highlight weekly meetings. AED recruits new members early in the fall and spring quarters. Because AED is an honor society, mem\u00ad bership is contingent upon class ranking (the top 35 percent), completion of five quarters of academic work, and a brief pledge period, during which commitment to the society is assessed. BSSO. The Black Students Science Organization (BSSO) was established to maintain a unified and supportive community of successful Black science and prehealth professional stu\u00ad dents at UCI. The group holds bimonthly meetings; sponsors guest speakers; provides academic support in the form of study sessions, examinations, and study aids from previous courses; organizes trips to medical schools, hospitals, and conferences; arranges gatherings with physicians and medical students; hosts fund-raising events; and compiles and dissem\u00ad inates information on careers, conferences, hospital and laboratory positions, and issues affecting the Black commu\u00ad nity in particular. BSSO also works in close association with the UCI-California College of Medicine chapter of the Stu\u00ad dent National Medical Association. Major achievements have included \"BSSO Week\" and the cosponsoring of the annual UCI-CCM Third World Pre-Medical Awareness Conference. CCM. Chicanos for Creative Medicine has been established to promote interaction among Biological Sciences and pre\u00ad health professional Chicana-Latino students at UCI. The aims of CCM are (I) to help members attain their career goals, (2) to provide resource information pertinent to the success of Chicano-Latina students at UCI, and (3) to create and maintain a sense of awareness and attitude of being a Chicano-Latina student at UCI. Activities include guest lec\u00ad turers speaking on their research; Latino professionals, including physicians, dentists, and other health professionals, speaking on their careers; field trips to communities lacking adequate health care; and quarterly fund-raising activities. The group works closely with the Chicano Medical Student Association of the UCI-California College of Medicine and with the La Raza Medical Association, a Statewide organization. CPSA. The Chinese Pre-health Student Association (CPSA) is dedicated to providing both academic and moral support to Asian Pacific students who are interested in pursuing careers in the health sciences. The organization's main goal is to introduce the students to a friendly and cooperative envi\u00ad ronment in which they may receive academic counseling and interact with other students with similar interests. Every year CPSA invites guest speakers from various health fields to talk about their professions. Faculty and counselors also are invited to give students a detailed overview of medical school admissions preparation and career developments in medicine. In addition, CPSA sponsors a variety of academic and social events such as picnics, dinners, exam reviews, athletic events, field trips, and workshops. Dental Club. The Dental Club is an organization designed to promote exposure to dentistry for students interested in a career in the dental profession. The Club provides an oppor\u00ad tunity for students to learn about dentistry through listening to guest speakers and attending workshops featuring visiting dentists. The Dental Club helps students with their applica\u00ad tions to dental school and offers information on dental UC IRVINE - 1987-1988schools, field trips to local schools, and counseling. The Club also offers mock Dental Admission Test examinations. Medspur. Medspur is dedicated to helping prehealth profes\u00ad sional students achieve both social and academic endeavors while at UCI. Each year Medspur brings together approxi\u00ad mately 100 students who are interested in pursuing profes\u00ad sional careers in human and animal medicine and other health fields, providing an environment conducive to the development of cooperation and friendship within the School of Biological Sciences. Medspur is committed to providing members with the opportunity to learn about the realities of their prospective careers and the issues which face health care specialists. In addition, Medspur invites members of the community to speak about their professions and organizes tours of medical school facilities. The organization also spon\u00ad sors course examination reviews for the Biological Sciences core curriculum. Flying Samaritans. The Flying Samaritans of UCI is com\u00ad prised of student volunteers involved in health care at the Orange County Clinic in Santa Ana, California, and at the El Testerazo Clinic in Baja California. One weekend per month, members staff the clinic in Mexico and help administer, trans\u00ad late, and otherwise assist health professionals in such duties as taking vital signs. Activities include an annual Christmas party at the El Testerazo Clinic, and collection of clothing, food, and toys for distribution to people in need. The Flying Samaritans recently helped coordinate a Mexican Earthquake Relief Project to provide aid for the victims of the 1985 Mex\u00ad ico City earthquake. KHA. The Korean Health Association (KHA) was organized for Korean prehealth students to enhance their awareness of the diversity of health education opportunities. Although KHA concentrates on participants' academic concerns, it also provides opportunities for them to develop and strengthen friendships. The goals of KHA are (1) to assist students in achieving successful academic endeavors in undergraduate studies, (2) to offer assistance and consultation to students regarding their future health-related career goals, (3) to ena\u00ad ble students to meet one another, and (4) to encourage peer counseling and tutoring among students. The KHA also pro\u00ad vides academic and career counseling and sponsors work\u00ad shops which are presented by professionals who represent health-related careers. USee Eyes. USee Eyes is dedicated to helping students interested in optometry learn more about the profession. Members have the opportunity to observe optometrists in different practice settings and tour the Southern California College of Optometry. Workshops on the application process and preparation for the optometry school entrance exam also are available. Vietnamese in Health Science. The Vietnamese in Health Science organization provides members with opportunities to learn about career options in the health sciences. Each quar\u00ad ter the organization offers seminars, personal counseling ses\u00ad sions, and volunteer opportunities in health sciences professions. Graduate Program The School of Biological Sciences offers graduate study in a wide variety of fields ranging across the spectrum of the bio\u00ad logical sciences. The four Departments of the School of Bio\u00ad logical Sciences (Developmental and Cell Biology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Biology and Biochemistry, and Psychobiology) and four Departments of the College of Medicine (Anatomy and Neurobiology, Biological Chemistry, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, and Physiology and Biophysics) cooperate in the conduct of a unified graduate Biological Sciences 89 program, administered by the School of Biological Sciences. The organization of the Departments encourages an interdis\u00ad ciplinary approach to scientific problems, especially at the graduate level. All programs of study, regardless of emphasis, lead to the degrees of Master of Science (M.S.) and Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) in the Biological Sciences. Each Department has a graduate advisor whom students may consult in regard to the technical details of their individual programs. Applications for admission to graduate study are evaluated both by the Division of Graduate Studies and Research and by the program or the Department to which the student has applied on the basis of letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, grades, and other qualifications of the applicant. Candidates for graduate admission are urged to consult the department(s) whose faculty and expertise best fit their interests. Some faculty are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. These faculty are from the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences; the Departments of Developmental and Cell Biology and Molecular Biology and Biochemistry in the School of Biologi\u00ad cal Sciences; and the Department of Physiology and Biophys\u00ad ics in the UCI-California College of Medicine. This program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate stu\u00ad dents and faculty who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together monthly to discuss research prob\u00ad lems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy in the Biological Sciences While both the Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy programs are offered, emphasis at the graduate level is on the Ph.D. programs. Most training takes place within one of the departments, although full facilities and curricular offer\u00ad ings are available to all graduate students in all departments of the biological sciences. Interdisciplinary study and research are encouraged. Students are expected to maintain a B average at all times, attain the Master's degree in two years, and attain the Ph.D. in four or five years, depending on departmental affiliation. A Master's degree, however, is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree. During the first part of the initial year of graduate work, the student plans an academic program in consultation with the graduate advisor or a small committee. Faculty advisors are changed if the specific interests of the student change. In addition, it is possible for students to transfer to another program in the School, subject to the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies, provided that they are acceptable into that program. Students are encouraged to consult with other faculty members with regard to their research and academic interests. During their graduate training all students will serve some time as teacher apprentices under the direction of advanced teaching assistants and faculty. Advanced graduate students may work closely with faculty in the planning and execution of the teaching program. The amount and exact nature of the teaching experience varies with the department. UC IRVINE - 1987-198890 Biological Sciences Master of Science Depending upon the program, there are two plans by which a Master of Science degree may be obtained. Plan 1: Thesis Plan The student completes seven upper\u00ad division and graduate courses including a minimum of five nonresearch courses. The student then presents a thesis based upon research done while in the School. Plan II: Comprehensive Examination Plan The student com\u00ad pletes a minimum of nine upper-division and graduate courses. At least six must be graduate courses (numbered 200-299) in the student's field specialization. This program is terminated with a comprehensive final examination. Doctor of Philosophy First Level of Competence The student attains this level by completing oral or written examinations at the discretion of the department. Second Level of Competence This level is attained by passing an examination dealing with the student's particular inter\u00ad ests. A committee for the purpose of administering this examination is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies. Once this examination is completed, the student is advanced to candidacy for the degree and is considered to have for\u00ad mally begun dissertation research. The student submits a dis\u00ad sertation on this research and defends it at an oral examina\u00ad tion during the final year of graduate study. Specialization Courses in Biological Sciences Undergraduates have the opportunity to specialize in several areas of biology which may be defined by taking a series of related courses in the School.

Schneiderman: Developmental biology and insect physiology Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology The Department of Developmental and Cell Biology is con\u00ad cerned with the development, physiology, structure, and function of organisms and their component cells. The main emphasis of the Developmental and Cell Biology graduate program is research training in developmental biology, com\u00ad parative physiology of animals, or cellular and developmental plant biology. The Department maintains facilities for research involving biochemistry; genetics; electron micro\u00ad scopy; cell, tissue, and organism culture; microsurgery; and neurophysiology. Students in the Department of Developmental and Cell Biol\u00ad ogy generally enter one of three graduate curricula. In the first year, those emphasizing comparative physiology take a three-quarter sequence of organismic physiology (Develop\u00ad mental and Cell Biology 210). Those emphasizing develop\u00ad mental biology take a three-quarter sequence of courses on molecular and cellular biology during the first year, followed by a total of five advanced courses during the subsequent years. Those emphasizing cell biology take a three-quarter series of core courses focused on cell biology as well as courses in protein and nucleic acid biochemistry. The selec\u00ad tion of the first-year course program is made in consultation with a faculty advisory committee when the student first arrives on the campus. This committee monitors the stu\u00ad dent's progress through the first year after which the stu\u00ad dent's thesis committee is established and takes over the advising function. Students are able to diverge from this basic core into their areas of special interest by means of graduate seminar courses in subsequent years. At the end of the first year students in comparative physiology and cellular and developmental plant biology take an oral examination that covers a broad area in the general and related fields of interest to that student. Students in developmental and cell biology prepare and defend a research proposal and are exam\u00ad ined in fields related to the proposal. Since many doctoral students in the Department undertake academic careers, the Department requires each graduate student to participate in a directed teaching experience during each year of the gradu\u00ad ate program. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinar\u00ad ily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within five years or less. Developmental and Cell Biology 95 In keeping with the responsibilities of the University, ihe School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences encourages vigorous faculty and student research programs. Some faculty from the Department are members of an inter\u00ad disciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. See page 89 for a description of the program.

Justice: Terrestrial population ecology George V. Lauder, Functional evo- lution and function of natural products in desert plants Michael R. Rose: Evolution of life histories and genetic systems H. Bradley Shaffer: Evolutionary genetics; functional morphology Grover C. Stephens: Comparative animal physiology Ecology and evolutionary biology deals with the establish\u00ad ment of adaptations over evolutionary time and with the sig\u00ad nificance of these adaptations in ecological time. The Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology focuses on problems at the population and community levels, with par\u00ad ticular emphasis placed on coevolved processes. While the Department has faculty specialists in plant and animal ecol\u00ad ogy and in marine and terrestrial ecology, primary attention is given to important ecological questions rather than to par\u00ad ticular habitats or taxa. Faculty and graduate student research is often centered at the interface of two or more of these specialties. Departmental research activities include eco\u00ad logical energetics, plant-herbivore and plant-pollinator inter\u00ad actions, microbial ecology and coevolution, quantitative genetics, life history evolution, population and reproductive ecology, and community ecology. These research endeavors attempt to achieve a balance between empirical and theoreti\u00ad cal approaches to evolutionary and ecological problems. Primary emphasis in the Department graduate program is placed on training leading to the Ph.D. in Biological Sciences; under exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted initially to the M.S. program. All entering students are required to enroll during the first year in a two-quarter UC IRVINE - 1987-1988graduate core sequence. At the end of the first year, these students will complete an oral examination based upon the core courses and other materials the Department might . require. Satisfactory performance on this examination is required for continuation in the graduate program. Students entering with a B.A. or B.S. degree will enroll in the graduate core for two consecutive years, while those entering with an M.A. or M.S. degree will enroll only for the initial year. Each entering graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor and a three-person advisory committee for guidance, with whom the student will meet at least once each quarter. All students are encouraged to submit a research proposal to their advisory committee during their first year of residency. A comprehensive proposal is required before the end of the second year. The progress of each student is reviewed by the departmental faculty before the end of each academic year. Normally, all requirements for the Ph.D. should be completed within five years. No more than six years will be allowed for completion of the program. Prior to advancement to candi\u00ad dacy for the Ph.D., st.udents must satisfy two breadth requirements at the discretion of their advisory committee. One of these must be satisfied with a foreign language and the second by the attainment of an additional skill equivalent to a second foreign language (i.e., a second foreign language, demonstrated skills in computer-statistics, attainment of unusual technical expertise necessary for dissertation research, etc.). Advancement to doctoral candidacy by a com\u00ad prehensive oral examination will be expected during the third year for students entering with a B.A. or B.S. or during the second year for those entering with an M.A. or M.S. Appli\u00ad cants for this program should have a solid undergraduate program in biology and ecology, emphasizing both research and field work. In addition, course work in statistics, mathe\u00ad matics, and physical and chemical sciences is expected. All applicants are required to submit verbal, quantitative, and advanced biology GRE scores. The deadline for application is February I.

The faculty's research interests include structure and synthe\u00ad sis of nucleic acids and proteins, regulation, metabolism, bio\u00ad chemical genetics, gene organization, and immunology. The first-year student is required to take a core of advanced courses (203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, and 209), to become associated with the laboratories of at least three different investigators, and to attend the 201A-B-C seminar series. During the first year, students are advised by members of the graduate committee. Upon successful completion of the first year, the student is given a comprehensive oral examina\u00ad tion to test breadth and depth of knowledge. Although further supplemental work may be recommended, the stu\u00ad dent normally begins a specific research project with a faculty member in the second year. The student, by passing an oral examination by the end of the third year on the proposed dis\u00ad sertation work, may advance to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Students normally complete their degree programs after a total of five years of graduate study. Participation in the seminar series (201A-B-C) and completion of at least one satellite course per year (210-279) are expected of all continu\u00ad ing students. Regular teaching of undergraduates is part of the training of graduate students at all levels. The graduate committee may waive some of the above requirements for candidates for the Master's degree. Applicants should have adequate undergraduate preparation in calculus, physics, physical chemistry, organic chemistry, and biochemistry. Students who have not had an adequate physical chemistry course are expected to take Chemistry 130A-B-C during their first year. Some faculty from the Department of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group.

Swett: Peripheral nervous system, spinal cord, pain mechanisms The Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology in the Col\u00ad lege of Medicine offers a doctoral program leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences, with specialized research training in the neurosciences. Research programs in the neu\u00ad rosciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, intracellular physiology, circadian rhythms, forebrain organiza\u00ad tion and function, and development of sensory and motor systems. Research programs also include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pulmonary edema. The Department maintains research facilities so that the student can become experienced with the following data. Students are encour\u00ad aged to become proficient in multiple areas of study using interdisciplinary techniques. Anatomy and Neurobiology 101 Several departments from the College of Medicine offer doctoral programs leading to the Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences. Students in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the necessary technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to conduct innovative, fundamental research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable anat\u00ad omists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a basic and extended academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of modern neurobiology, with an emphasis on morphology, chemistry, and physiology. In the first year, students are required to take selected courses in anatomy, biochemistry, pharmacology, and physiology, includ\u00ad ing a year-long course in neural science techniques. Over the usual four-year training period the student is required to complete a practical course in statistics, selected departmental seminar courses, at least two laboratory rotations, and a total of 50 credit hours of research in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology or other departments on campus may also be taken, and research and training in areas other than neurobiology are possible. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to tak\u00ad ing core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Usually, no courses are taken in the third year. Fol\u00ad lowing the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in at least one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora\u00ad tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. A Qual\u00ad ifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Committee. The examination consists of written papers in three of the follow\u00ad ing: fundamental neuroscience, developmental neuroscience, neural systems I, or neural systems II, determined by the candidate's field of specialization. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 102 Anatomy and Neurobiology The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee, and an oral research proposal is made. The majority of the second, third, and fourth years is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written dissertation suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete.

UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 106 Fine Arts School of Fine Arts Robert Garfias Dean In every age and in every society known to us the arts have played a role of vital importance. From this we infer not simply that the arts are, and have always been, important but also that the very essence of humans may depend on the abil\u00ad ity to express themselves. The School of Fine Arts is con\u00ad cerned with the vitality of the arts in our own society. Ener\u00ad gies are directed toward the refinement, enhancement, and encouragement of the artistic and creative talent of the stu\u00ad dents who enter the School and the development of their understanding of related theory and history. The School of Fine Arts functions as a conservatory within a university, dedicated to the creation and production of art within the context of its history, theory, and criticism. The five major areas of instruction and production are art history, dance, drama, music, and studio art. Undergraduate majors are offered in Fine Arts (General Interdisciplinary), History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Requirements include extensive studio and work\u00ad shop experiences, essential theoretical and historical back\u00ad ground studies, and exercises in criticism. The requirements for all performing and studio majors in the fine arts are designed to provide opportunities for the student-artist to work creatively for at least four hours a day from the fresh\u00ad man year through graduation. A student who wishes to pursue a double major by combin\u00ad ing two majors from the School of Fine Arts or by combining a major from the School with a major from another academic unit may do so with the proviso that only one major can be officially declared until the senior year. At that time, when the requirements for both majors are nearly completed, the student can be approved as a double major. In addition to producing student concerts, musicals, and dra\u00ad matic performances, the School of Fine Arts presents a varied offering of cultural events each year, including distinguished lecturers, world-renowned concert artists, outstanding dance and drama groups, jazz and folk performers, a film series, and a gallery program. The Fine Arts Village includes studio and classroom space for the areas of History of Art, Studio Art, Dance, Drama, and Music. Specialized facilities for the studio art area include an Art Gallery and six well-lighted studios for drawing, paint\u00ad ing, sculpture, graphics, and ceramics. Power equipment for sculpture, two presses for graphics (intaglio), print making and lithography, and two kilns for ceramics are available. The Village Theatre, conventionally designed, contains an orches\u00ad tra pit, a large completely equipped stage, and seating for 420 people. The Concert Hall, seating 230, has a thrust platform stage, a Baroque pipe organ, and excellent acoustics. The Studio Theatre provides an experimental stage base without fixed seats, allowing complete freedom in determining the style of production. The Little Theatre, located in Humanities Hall, and the Virginia and Norman Nixon Studio Theatre are intimate proscenium theatres for Drama Workshops and graduate directing projects. All theatres are completely equipped with modern sound and lighting systems, and stu\u00ad dents involved in productions work in completely equipped and professionally operated scenery and costume shops. Campus television studios are also located in the Village. Music students attend orchestra rehearsals in a special Vil\u00ad lage facility also utilized for choral and instrumental ensem\u00ad ble rehearsals. Practice rooms are equipped with Steinway and other practice pianos, and Steinway concert grands are used in concerts. A music listening laboratory is also available to music students. Dance classes in ballet, modern, and jazz are held in four locations: the two main studios in the Fine Arts Village, Crawford Hall (gymnasium), and the Studio Theatre. In addition to their formal instruction and participation, stu\u00ad dents in the School of Fine Arts and qualified students from other academic areas are involved at a less formal level as participants, organizers, and coordinators throughout the year in the various production units, including University Chorus, UCI Symphony Orchestra, University Theatre, Stu\u00ad dent Exhibitions, Graduate Art Gallery, Dance Concerts, Dance Workshop, Drama Workshop, Music and Opera Work- shop, and Television Production. \u00b7 The opportunity is provided for all qualified UCI students to participate in the UCI Pep Band and Song Leaders, and to receive course credit for this participation. Those interested should see the instructor of Theatre Orchestra, Music 173, about requirements for participation and,enrollment in the appropriate course. \u00b7 All new Fine Arts students are assigned or may choose their own faculty advisors and are encouraged to meet with them during orientation week and periodically throughout the year to plan programs of study and to discuss educational and career objectives. In addition, students are invited to make use of the counseling services in the Fine Arts Counseling Office for assistance with programs, requirements, or any academic matter.

This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in Business Administration (M.B.A.) along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Com\u00ad pletion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. Upon admission, senior~year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful com\u00ad pletion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM Master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Fine Arts 107 Professor Stephen Erdody conducts a strings workshop. The School of Fine Arts includes five major areas ofinstruction and production: art history, dance, drama, music, and studio art. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 108 Fine Arts/General interdisciplinary Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages students to examine religion and religious phe\u00ad nomena in the context of the several disciplines represented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate curriculum; it allows students to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to their major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participating students expand their appreciation and under standing of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abili\u00ad ties in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the con\u00ad tributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. Honors Students who have distinguished themselves academically will be considered for honors at graduation. A general criteria is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. In keeping with the Academic Senate Resolution no more than 12 percent of the graduating seniors may receive honors. Undergraduate Program Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: None (see under programs). Graduate Program The School of Fine Arts offers programs leading to the Mas\u00ad ter of Fine Arts degree in Fine Arts with concentrations in Studio Art, Dance, and Music, and to the Master of Fine Arts in Drama. Areas of emphasis within the Drama M.F.A. pro\u00ad gram include Directing, Acting, Design, and Music Theatre. The primary activity of the School of Fine Arts is perfor\u00ad mance-the creative act. Research activities are concerned with illuminating performance and inspiring the studio expe\u00ad rience. The intellectual activity of theoretical, literary, and historical courses complements the practical work in studio workshops and performance. The aim of the program is, thus, to produce literate artists who are responsive to intel\u00ad lectual stimuli, who are capable of integrating knowledge into creative acts, and who are disciplined to the point of freedom. It is the strong belief of the School that intellectual integrity and professional excellence cannot exist without each other. Admission to the Program Applications are accepted for fall quarter admission only, and ordinarily must be completed by March 1 as the number of graduate students that can be admitted to the School of Fine Arts is limited. Applicants are advised to arrange for audi\u00ad tions, interviews, and the submission of portfolios, composi-tions, and dossiers, as appropriate, by March 1. Students applying for scholarships and fellowships should do so by March 1, and are also encouraged to apply for financial assistance through the Financial Aid Office. The School of Fine Arts has a modest number of teaching assistantships available in all areas, and all candidates are automatically reviewed for teaching assistantship positions; the School informs successful candidates by June 1 for the following academic year. Upon admission to the program the student will be assigned an advisor. The student should discuss with this advisor the scope of undergraduate preparation to determine any areas which may need strengthening if the student is to derive full benefit from graduate study. Fine Arts General Interdisciplinary Keith Fowler, D.F.A. Yale University, Chair of General Inter\u00ad disciplinary Studies, Associate Professor of Drama, and Head of Directing The program in general interdisciplinary studies is designed for students who wish to combine the various disciplines in fine arts. Although participation in studio classes is required, the program emphasizes the study of the history, theory, and criticism of the arts in four of the School's instructional areas. The nature of the program provides each student the opportunity to plan a uniquely individual course of study with the approval of an advisor. Because the general interdis\u00ad ciplinary program is designed for students with a strong sense of personal direction and a desire for an academic appreciation of the arts, students wishing to enter the pro\u00ad gram must submit a statement of purpose to the General Interdisciplinary Studies Committee prior to the quarter in which they intend to declare their major. Admission to the program is based upon the statement of purpose and upon the student's prior record of high academic performance. Upon completion of this program, students will be awarded the B.A. in Fine Arts with General Interdisciplinary as the area of concentration.

The program is concerned with both the formal structure of the visual arts and their function within society. Students major\u00ad ing in the history of art thus are urged to take appropriate courses in classics, history, literature, and philosophy, as well as in other areas of the fine arts. All majors also are encour\u00ad aged to study a second language beyond the minimum departmental requirement of two years in a single foreign language at the university level. Careers for the History of Art Major A Bachelor's degree in the History of Art is excellent prepa\u00ad ration for pursuing either a career as an art historian or museum curator, or professional study in an entirely differ\u00ad ent discipline. History of Art majors have gone on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional school to study art history, archaeology, architecture, law, library science, business (in some cases with special focus in the fine arts), or teacher education. The study of the History of Art is a valuable part of a liberal edu\u00ad cation that provides a means of looking at the history and culture of both the past and the present.

University of California, Irvine, Assistant Professor of Studio Art (ceramics) Art Nomura, M.F.A. University of California, Los Angeles, Lecturer in Studio Art (video production) The program in studio art provides basic studio experiences in the fundamental concepts and techniques of drawing, painting, sculpture, ceramics, graphics (printmaking), video and art photography, and a study of the history and criticism of art. The curriculum constantly relates studio practice to the development of the visual arts and current critical theory. It aims to develop a sense of visual awareness through as wide a range of the study of arts as possible. The student majoring in studio art develops creativity by learning to think with the materials and techniques of various media. The Studio Arts faculty expects students at both the under\u00ad graduate and graduate levels to be willing to experiment and change rather than to conform with the kind of work they were doing when they were admitted into the program. The faculty supports work in process as well as finished projects, so long as the student is practicing sustained and disciplined wo~k habits. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Careers for the Studio Art Major Studio Art faculty and gallery exhibitions have provided career examples and inspiration for prospective professional artists. An unusually high percentage of Studio Art alumni have gone on to successful exhibitions and arts management careers. Many graduates teach at all levels and work in museums as curators or preparators (those who prepare the gallery for an exhibit and hang or install the works). A Studio Art major is also good preparation for further study at the graduate level. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: None.

General Information The M.F.A. program focuses on development of experimental concepts and approaches relevant to contemporary issues as they affect visual arts, rather than on traditional techniques and ideas. A small, personal environment supports the indi\u00ad vidual's efforts in research, development, and exhibition of ideas by providing as much latitude for special needs as possi\u00ad ble. Faculty meeting with students on a one-to-one basis or in small groups provides a variety of art experiences. Intern\u00ad ships,' selected field trips, contemporary exhibitions in the University Fine Arts Gallery, contact with visiting profes\u00ad sional artists, and seminars provide the framework for the program. Off-campus graduate student studio space is available on a limited basis by application to the appropriate program chair or to the graduate advisor. Admission Applicants for admission to the degree program must meet the general requirements for admission to graduate study, hold a B.A. or B.F.A. in Art, and submit by March 1 a port\u00ad folio of their creative work or 12 or more slides, on a #80 Kodak Carousel tray, of their most recent work. Normally, anyone who has earned an M.F.A. degree in Studio Art will not be considered for admission into the program. General Degree Requirements Normally two years of residence are required. Each candidate must enroll for three courses each quarter for six quarters, exclusive of summer sessions. The student's progress and body of work will be reviewed by a faculty committee yearly. A satisfactory opinion by this Studio Art 111 Specialized facilities for studio art include six studios for drawing, painting, sculp- ture, graphics, and ceramics, and an art gallery. . committee will allow the student to progress to candidacy for the degree. Satisfactory attainment must be demonstrated by a specific creative project, which usually takes the form of a graduate exhibition in the University Fine Arts Gallery. This project is to be supported by a thesis incorporating visual and written material relevant to the project and the candidate's creative research while at UCI. Oral defense of the project and essay may be required to test the candidate's general knowledge in the area in which the project falls. Specific Degree Requirements Seventy-two quarter units in graduate or approved upper\u00ad division undergraduate courses must be completed with a grade of at least B or the letter grade S in each course. Not more than 20 units in upper-division courses may count toward the degree. Electives may be taken in any discipline. The 72 units will normally be made up in the following manner: First Year: three courses in graduate problems (Studio Art 215A-B); three seminars in problems of contemporary art (Studio Art 230); three courses in graduate projects (Studio Art 240).

Indiana University, San Diego Ballet, Lecturer in Dance (ballet) Kiyoaki Terajima, Kuroemon, Lecturer in Dance and Drama (Kabuki and modern Japanese theatre) \u00b7 The program in dance provides studio experiences in the fundamental knowledge and techniques of classical ballet and of contemporary dance movements. The classical academic approach to ballet adheres to those principles developed from Noverre through Petipa and Cecchetti modified to accommo\u00ad date our current understanding of those laws of physics and of the human anatomy applicable to the study of dance. The workshops in contemporary dance explore and extend the various approaches to modern dance and jazz, concentrating on physiological and rhythmic problems encountered in con\u00ad temporary choreography. Studies in preclassic dance forms and their musical structures provide additional workshop experience as well as significant research materials for cho\u00ad reographic problems. Workshops in ethnic dance provide additional choreographic resources in the context of their cul\u00ad tural setting. Theoretical and historical courses complement the practical work in workshops, choreography, and perfor\u00ad mance. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as dancers, as choreographers, as teachers, or as historians, as well as for students who, while not planning to make dance their vocation, have a serious interest in the theory, practice, criticism, research, or therapy and history of dance. The traditional technique of classical ballet constitutes a craft and style that serves not only as a physiological center for the logical training of the body, but also as a basic language of movement for the choreographer. Workshop experiences build progressively on the techniques of ballet and extend through the contemporary idioms of modern and jazz. The aim is to develop kinetic resources, precision, flexibility, and freedom in a coordinated and intelligently responsive body. Careers for the Dance Major In addition to the perhaps more obvious careers in profes\u00ad sional dance, choreography, and teaching, a major in Dance also can serve as a basis for graduate study or job opportuni\u00ad ties in, for example, dance therapy, dance history, kinesiology/ anatomy, and dance notation. Related fields such as adminis\u00ad tration, design, and music also offer positions in dance. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: None. Performance Requirements Students planning to major in dance should develop basic ability in techniques of ballet, modern, and jazz dance forms. Although freshmen entering with fewer than 12 units are not required to audition, a placement examination is offered. The evaluation of the examination indicates the level of ballet, modern, and jazz at which the student is placed. Freshmen declaring the dance major are encouraged to take the placement examination, especially if they feel they could be placed at a higher level than Ballet I, Modern I, and Jazz I. At the end of the freshman year the student should select one of the four major em~hases with faculty approval. At the end of the sophomore year, the faculty will determine whether the student is making sufficient progress to .proceed as an upper-division major. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 114 Dance All advanced standing applicants (entering students with 12 units or more) to the University who have indicated an inter\u00ad est in majoring in dance are required to audition and will be notified by the School of the date. Evaluations of the stu\u00ad dent's audition will indicate whether or not the student may major in dance and wilLindicate the appropriate placeri-tent level in ballet and modern for students admitted to the major. This placement level determines the minimum amount of years it will take to complete the degree requirements. Inasmuch as the level of performance ability generally deter\u00ad mines the length of time in study, and all transfer students must anticipate meeting the total performance requirements for the B.A. degree, students deficient in level of perfor\u00ad mance in comparison to their level of academic study should be prepared to extend their studies in order to meet perfor\u00ad mance requirements.

Each major in drama experiences exacting and rigorous training in the mutually interrelated areas of the theatre: performance, UC IRVINE - 1987-1988design, literature, history, and criticism. The curriculum con\u00ad stantly relates studio practices, technical resources, and pro\u00ad ductional techniques to the development of dramatic litera\u00ad ture and current critical theory. The student specializes dur\u00ad ing the last two years of study in acting, directing, design, or criticism. The program is designed for students preparing to continue professionally as actors, directors, designers, critics, and teachers, as well as for students who, while not planning to make the theatre their vocation, have a serious interest in the literature, theory, and practice of drama. Careers for the Drama Major A degree in Drama may or may not lead to professional employment in theatre or films. A professional career in act\u00ad ing demands, in addition to excellent training, great talent, great dedication, and not a little bit of luck-intangibles no drama program can promise or even imply. Graduates in Drama at UCI have performed in Broadway plays, regional and summer theatres, and in films and tele\u00ad vision. At least seven thriving repertory theatres in the coun\u00ad try have been created by UCI Drama graduates; all of these theatres regularly add new members from the UCI alumni. Not all Drama students become professional theatre artists. Many embark upon careers in law, business, ari:s manage\u00ad ment, advertising, and teaching; others pursue further study earning the Master of Fine Arts degree at Irvine or elsewhere. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements! See pages 48-50. School Requirements: None.

Parsons Dean The School of Humanities sets for itself the goal of helping to develop both the analytical and creative powers of its stu\u00ad dents with particular respect not only to vocational goals, but also the larger questions of human conduct, the modes of human communication and symbolization, speculative thought, and the verbal arts. The School includes those basic disciplines of language, literature, history, and philosophy that deal fundamentally with the texture and dimensions of experience, both individual and social, past and present. The School takes as its concern a large portion of the liberal edu\u00ad cation not only of students who intend to major within its confines, but also of students who come to it from other parts of the campus. Because of the nature of the disciplines collected in the School, it is deeply concerned with language and its many facets. Further, though the School has estab\u00ad lished a number of specific major courses of study, it is intent on integrating the basic disciplines in a variety of ways at the undergraduate level and to some extent at the graduate level.

To be nomi\u00ad nated the student must achieve a UC grade point average of at least 3.40 and receive strong recommendation from the department. A minimum of 18 courses (72 units) in residence at a UC campus is a necessary condition for honors at grad\u00ad uation. To be eligible for nomination, the student must meet all honors criteria and file an application for graduation by the end of the winter quarter of the senior year. Undergraduate Programs The Schooloffers undergraduate majors in Classical Civiliza\u00ad tion, Classics, Comparative Literature, English, Film Studies, French, German, History, Humanities (including an Emphasis in Women's Studies), Linguistics, Philosophy, Russian, and Spanish. It offers courses in Chinese, Japanese, Italian, and Portuguese. A corps of lower-division advisors is designed to meet the special needs of freshmen and sophomores who are inter\u00ad ested in the humanities but who have not chosen a major in the School. The advisors are particularly interested in under\u00ad graduate education and especially knowledgeable about Uni\u00ad versity regulations, requirements in and outside the School, course content, options to major, and other matters that may present difficulties. For the first two years, students in Humanities are encouraged to explore the various disciplines represented in the School. During that time the lower\u00ad division advisor is prepared to help the undeclared student keep options to major open, plan a coherent program of humanistic study, and reach an eventual decision about the major. NOTE: In many undergraduate courses in the School of Humanities, additional meetings between individual students and the instructor may be required. Generally each major stipulates a one-year course that is both an introduction to the discipline and a prerequisite to the major itself. Students who plan wisely with their advisors will construct programs that include a good number of such courses. Undergraduate students in the School of Humanities partici\u00ad pate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serv\u00ad ing on committees of various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the Humanities Council, which directly advises the Dean. Graduates of the School of Humanities often go on to gradu\u00ad ate and professional schools. An undergraduate major in the humanities is excellent preparation for future careers in law, teaching at all levels, business, journalism, administration, government service at all levels, and also medicine. Humanities Honors Program The Honors Program of the School of Humanities is designed to challenge superior students and provide them with unique opportunities for interdisciplinary work. Honors Program participants will have the added advantage of being able to pursue independent research with a faculty member and to participate in advanced,seminars in humanistic inquiry. The Program is open by invitation to students from programs and disciplines outside the School of Humanities. The Humanities Honors Program offers three honors sequences. Honors Humanities 1A-B-C, open by invitation to selected students, provides special discussion sections for honors students enrolled in the Humanities Core Course. Honors Humanities 2A-B-C compares and contrasts modes of analysis and critical thinking in history, literary studies, and philosophy in a small seminar setting. The third honors sequence (Humanities H139, H140, H141) combines critical analysis with the writing of an honors thesis in the student's major field. Honors students are invited to participate in special student\u00ad faculty colloquia as well as informal gatherings. Individual\u00ad ized counseling on courses and careers is available. Entering freshmen participants may request priority consideration for housing. For additional information, please contact the Office of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Study, School of Humanities, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717, tele\u00ad phone (714) 856-5132. Language Laboratory The Language Laboratory serves as the audio-lingual resource center for the following languages taught in the School of Humanities: Spanish, French, German, Russian, Portuguese, and Italian. Students, faculty, and staff may listen to cassettes of audio material in the Laboratory, or they may check out cassettes and cassette players to practice at home. Members of the community are welcome to use the Language Laboratory facilities on campus. Jn addition to the languages offered in the School of Humani\u00ad ties, the Language Laboratory has a tape library that includes reels in Persian, Romanian, Chinese, Japanese, Dutch, Swed\u00ad ish, Norwegian, English, Hebrew, and Swahili. Arrangements can be made to provide these languages on cassette. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Humanities 131 Professor Jenny Hu presents a Chinese language class. In addition to languages, the School of Humanities offers courses of study in the disciplines of classics. literature, linguistics, history. film studies. and philosophy. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 132 Classics Through the business office, the Language Laboratory oper\u00ad ates a translation referral service for students, faculty, staff, members of the community, and local businesses. The Lan\u00ad guage Laboratory is located in 207 and 213 Humanities Hall and is open from 8:00a.m. until4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. The telephone number is (714) 856-6344. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements Humanities 1A-B-C, taken in the freshman year (transfer students may substitute appropriate course work in composi\u00ad tion, literature, history, humanities, and philosophy for the Core Course by permission: apply in the Dean's Office); two years of work in a single acceptable foreign language, either modern or classical (through 2C), or equivalent competence; quarterly consultation with an assigned advisor and the ad\u00ad visor's written approval for the program of study decided upon. Consultation should be made by the second week of each quarter. Foreign Language Placement. Students entering UCI with previous foreign language training are placed as follows: in general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school foreign language will normally enroll in 18-, 1C-, 2A-, or 28-levellanguage courses, respec\u00ad tively. Exceptions must have the approval of the instructor of the course. Transfer students may not repeat foreign lan\u00ad guage courses for which they received credit upon matricula\u00ad tion to UCI. School Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for each major must be completed success\u00ad fully at UCI. See individual major requirements for specific courses. Graduate Programs The School offers a wide program of graduate degrees. Although the Master's degree is offered in most depart\u00ad ments, the programs emphasize the Ph.D. and give distinct preference in admission to those students who intend to take that degree. Exceptions are the two-year Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) and the two-year Master of Arts of Teaching in Spanish. In addition to the seminars offered by the various departments, the School sponsors a number of interdisciplinary seminars annually. These courses are taught jointly by faculty members from various depart\u00ad ments. Further, several departments offer a few students the opportunity to do part of their work for the Ph.D. in a related discipline. A limited number of students is accepted annually to study for teaching credentials. This program is a cooperative effort between the School and the Office of Teacher Education. Graduate students in the School of Humanities participate in the affairs of the School in a number of ways: by serving on committees of the various departments, by sitting with the faculty in its meetings, and by serving on the student gradu\u00ad ate advisory committee, which directly advises the Dean. Department of Classics Dana F. Sutton, Ph.D. University of Wisconsin, Chair of the Depart\u00ad ment and Associate Professor of Classics (Greek and Latin drama, Greek poetry) Luci .Berkowitz, Ph.D. The Ohio State University, Professor of Clas\u00ad SICS (pastoral poetry, literary criticism) Theodore F. Brunner, Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Classics and Director, Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (computer applica\u00ad tion to classical literature, Augustan literature) Walter Donlan, Ph.D. Northwestern University, Professor of Classics (early Greek literature and social history) Richard I. Frank, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Associate Professor of Classics and History (Roman history, Classical tradition) Shelley P. Haley, Ph.D. University of Michigan, Assistant Professor of Classics (Latin historiography, women in antiquity) B.P. Reardon, D.U. Universite de Nantes, Professor of Classics (Late Greek literature, Greek novel) Undergraduate Program The Department of Classics aims to provide the undergradu\u00ad ate student with a working knowledge of the origins and her\u00ad itage of Western civilization. The Department is committed to a twofold purpose: (1) disseminating interest in and knowledge of Classical civilization through the teaching of Greek and Latin language and literature; and (2), helping stu\u00ad dents, through courses in Classical literature, history, civiliza\u00ad tion, mythology, and religion taught through English transla\u00ad tions, to appreciate the high achievements of Greek and Roman culture and their pervasive influence on our own civilization. The Department offers both a major in Classics (with an emphasis on Greek, Latin, or Linguistics) and a major in Classical Civilization in which most of the required courses are in English translation. Students are encouraged to consult with the Classics faculty regarding the appropriate choice of major and design of program. For the Classics major, study of the Classics must be based on competence in both Greek and Latin. The Classics pro\u00ad gram is designed to provide the student with this competence as rapidly as possible, so that by the end of first-year Greek or Latin the student has already been introduced to some of the major Classical authors in the original. From then on, courses are devoted to reading and interpreting the literature of ancient Greece and Rome. In addition to their training in the languages, students gain first-hand knowledge of the literature, history, and thought of the ancient world through the close study of some of its finest writers. The major in Classical Civilization is designed for students who do not plan to concentrate on the Classical languages or pursue graduate study in the classics, yet wish to obtain an undergraduate degree based on a sound knowledge of the Classical world. This major requires one year of study (or its equivalent) in either Greek or Latin and a minimum of 10 courses taught in English translation concerning such topics as Classical literature, civilization, history, archaeology, art, drama, and philosophy. The student planning to major in Classics or Classical Civili\u00ad zation should obtain a copy of the brochure, \"Undergraduate Study in Classics,\" available in the departmental office. Students entering UCI with previous Greek or Latin training can be given advanced standing. Usually, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, or four years of high school Latin (or Greek) will enroll in Latin (or Greek) 18, 1C, 25, and 101 respectively. Placement may vary, depending on the extent of the student's preparation. Students with high school training in the classical languages are encouraged to consult with the Classics staff before enrolling in Classics courses. The Department adheres to the policy of giving its students an opportunity to participate in the departmental decision\u00ad making process. Student representatives, elected from and by UC IRVINE - 1987-1988the undergraduate majors, participate in all departmental meetings. They are responsible for maintaining close liaison with their constituency, for representing the students' inter\u00ad est in curriculum and personnel matters, and for the evalua\u00ad tion of both the academic program and the academic staff. Inquiries regarding language placement, prerequisites, plan\u00ad ning a program of study, or other matters related to the Department's offerings should be directed to the Office of the Chair, 142 Humanities Hall, telephone (714) 856-6735 or 856-5896. Hebrew and Judaic Studies Courses in Hebrew and Judaic Studies were initiated by the Department of Classics in September 1976, through a joint agreement between the School of Humanities and the Uni\u00ad versity of Judaism in Los Angeles. Normally two years of Hebrew are offered, which meet the Humanities foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement. Emphasis is on modern Israeli-spoken Hebrew, with some instruction in Biblical Hebrew during the second year. Hebrew language courses will not be offered in 1987-88. Courses will continue to be offered in aspects of Jewish history, philosophy, and literature (Classics 180A-B-C, 181, and 182A-B-C). Through this program the Department of Classics is able to broaden its offerings to include both the Greek and Hebrew contributions to Western civilization. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132.

Classics 133 Planning a Program of Study The Department believes in close consultation with students on academic advising and program planning. Students plan\u00ad ning to major (or minor) in Classics or Classical Civilization are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty at the earliest possible moment to learn about the various programs. Career Opportunities The study of the ancient world is a valuable possession for modern life. The discipline of Classics is an important part of a liberal education. Greek and Latin language and literature, history and philosophy, mythology and religion make an excellent basis for exploring all periods of Western culture down to the present day. Classics is an interdisciplinary study, exploring human culture by a variety of methods from a variety of points of view. For this reason, the student who chooses to major in Classics or Classical Civilization may find many professional opportunities open. Graduate and professional schools in medicine, law, man\u00ad agement, and other fields welcome students with training in the Classics. So do many business corporations. Business, industry, and technology are well acquainted with the value of a Classical education. They are aware that students with a strong background in a respected and challenging major such as Classics are disciplined thinkers who can express them\u00ad selves in clear, coherent, and cogent language, capabilities that are considered valuable in future physicians, lawyers, and managers. There are also specific vocational opportunities open to the graduate in Classics or Classical Civilization. A major in this field may lead to a career in high school teaching, or (after appropriate further study) in college or university teaching. It is also an excellent preparation for advanced study in other academic disciplines such as archaeology, history, comparative literature, philosophy, and linguistics, as well as for theologi\u00ad cal studies and for work in a wide range of the humanities and social sciences. Graduate Program From the program's inception in 1970, emphasis has been on close attention to each student's progress, together with a relatively high reliance on independent work. Each graduate student is assigned to a faculty preceptor, who monitors stu\u00ad dent progress in language skills, knowledge of the discipline, competence in research, and experience in teaching. The principal strength of the Department lies in the fields of lan\u00ad guage and literature. The graduate program is closely con\u00ad nected with the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae research project, (see page 10), and this especially recommends our program to prospective students interested in computer-assisted research in these areas. The Department offers a Ph.D. program with specializations in Greek or Latin. The program is based on a three-year cycle of seminar and course work. Graduate students enroll in the following courses each quarter for three years: Classics 220 (seminars, devoted mainly but not exclusively to major liter\u00ad ary topics); Classics 230 (directed reading courses, focusing on the graduate reading list); and Classics 240 (Greek and Latin language study, with regular exercises in prose compo\u00ad sition and translation). Diagnostic tests administered at the start of the graduate student's career are used in planning work, so that each stu\u00ad dent is encouraged to focus their energies and to progress in UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 134 Classics a steady, organized manner. Progress evaluation examina\u00ad tions are administered regularly in order to identify student strengths and weaknesses. Normally a total of three years of course work is required for the Ph.D. A comprehensive can\u00ad didacy examination is required after the completion of course work, and a dissertation is required. A separate M.A. degree program is not offered, but an M.A. may be granted, where circumstances warrant, after the completion of two years of graduate work. Experience in supervised teaching and/or research activity normally is required. In addition to the above, instruction is given regularly in the tradition, methods, and tools of classical scholarship, includ\u00ad ing computer application to literature. In addition to course work, students are required to read extensively in the general field of Classics, under faculty guidance. Students take written examinations, and their progress is assessed periodically. Students are required to pass reading examinations in German and French at an early stage. After course work is completed, each student must pass an individ\u00ad ually designed qualifying examination, covering both the general field of Classics and the student's own interests, in order to become a candidate for the Ph.D. and enter the dis\u00ad sertation stage. The resources of the program are appreciably enhanced by contributions from other sources. In particular, cooperative arrangements are in force among the Classics graduate pro\u00ad grams of the UC campuses at Irvine, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara. Additionally, the program calls on visiting scholars, faculty from other UCI departments, and members of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project (see below). Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project The Thesaurus Linguae Graecae Project, a unique resource for research in Greek literary and linguistic studies, is closely affiliated with the Department of Classics although it is administratively separate.

Wlecke, Ph.D. Michigan State University, Associate Profes\u00ad sor of English (English and American Romanticism, teaching of composition) The Department of English and Comparative Literature is concerned with the nature and value of literature, possible approaches to literary works, and the relation of literary criti\u00ad cism to the intellectual issues of the day. Fundamentally it is concerned with the humanistic problem of value. Thus its main literary concern is critical and theoretical. Though not alone in the task, the Department recognizes a continuing obligation to help all students write the English language with clarity and grace. Students are given the opportunity to participate in depart\u00ad mental affairs through two elected student committees, one of undergraduates, one of graduates, which are concerned primarily with matters of personnel and curriculum. The committees meet periodically with faculty committees of the Department, and the recommendations of student commit\u00ad tees become matters of record which accompany any recom\u00ad mendations emanating from the Department. Each quarter all students taking classes within the Department have the opportunity to evaluate the particular course and teacher. Careers for the English or Comparative Literature Major The study of literature helps students to express their ideas clearly, do independent research, and think analytically and imaginatively. These capabilities will help qualify majors for careers in education, law, technical writing, communications, journalism, public relations, business, and management. An undergraduate major in either English or Comparative Liter\u00ad ature is also an especially good preparation for graduate study. The Undergraduate Majors Committee and the departmental faculty work closely with the Career Planning and Placement Center to help majors plan careers appropriate to the education in English or Comparative Literature at Irvine. Advisors encourage their students to investigate vari\u00ad ous careers-especially those outside the traditional fields for such majors (e.g., graduate study and law)-before these stu\u00ad dents have completed their undergraduate educations. Undergraduate Program The Department offers to the undergraduate three areas of study: The Program in Literary Criticism, which emphasizes a vari\u00ad ety of critical approaches in the reading and criticism of Eng\u00ad lish, American, and comparative literature. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988The Program in Writing, which offers an emphasis in the writing of poetry or fiction. Undergraduate courses in jour\u00ad nalism and nonfiction are also available, including formal instruction and workshop experience for staff members of the campus newspaper. The aim of the program is to encour\u00ad age the creative powers of students while introducing them to the discipline of reading and practical criticism, often in workshop situations. Under certain circumstances, creative writing courses may satisfy part of the writing requirement portion of the UCI breadth requirement (Category I). See page 49. The Program in Comparative Literature, which though administratively a part of the Department, is basically inter\u00ad disciplinary in its orientation, drawing on faculty and other resources from the fields of the various modern and classical literatures and drama. The consciousness of the modern edu\u00ad cated person is the product of centuries of cultural heritage, including not only works of literature in one's own language but world literature from Homer to Gide and Thomas Mann. At UCI, Comparative Literature is regarded as the study of literature from the international point of view rather than in a national framework. A student who completes a degree in Comparative Literature will be expected to have a grasp of the history of literature in its broad outlines and to be able to deal competently with literary texts, whatever their period or national origins. Since the Department believes that a student of literature should recognize the importance of understanding theoretical problems in literature, of developing a broad acquaintance with literary texts, and of experiencing the problems of liter\u00ad ary creation at first hand, the Department invites students to take work in all three of its programs, with an emphasis in one of the first two (toward a Bachelor's degree in English) or a major in the third (toward a Bachelor's degree in Compara\u00ad tive Literature). Many of the courses will vary in specific content from year to year, depending on the plans of individual teachers, since the Department recognizes that no course can treat all the major authors and works relevant to a given period or topic. Students intending to major in English or Comparative Liter\u00ad ature should obtain a copy of Undergraduate Study in English and Comparative Literature from the departmental office. Comparative Literature is well-suited for students interested in a double major. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132. Departmental Requirements for the English Major Two courses from the E 28A-B-C or CL 50A-B-C groups (including either E 28A or CL 50A) and a third course either from those two groups or from E 6, 7, 8 or CL 8; CR IOOA; CR 1008 and CL 100 (approved seminars from the course groups numbered in the 103s and 104s may be substituted for these courses); at least four courses from the E 101 group; at least five Department courses numbered above 101; competence in a foreign language, either classical or modern, equivalent to six quarters of work at Irvine (in classical lan\u00ad guages, IA-B-C and Greek or Latin 100 three times, though Greek or Latin 25 may be substituted for one of the 100 courses), plus (in modern languages) one course in a foreign literature in which texts are read in the original language. Students selecting a writing emphasis have some flexibility in substituting writing workshops for period and genre courses; their total courses normally number more than the usual major. English and Comparative Literature 137 Residence Requirement for the English Major: CR IOOA, CR IOOB, and three E lOis must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the English Minor Three courses selected from E28A-B-C, CL50A-B-C, or E6, 7, 8 sequences, including at least one quarter of E28; and at least five English or writing courses numbered 101 or higher, although two courses from the following may be substituted: CRIOOA, CRIOOB, WRIOOB, CLIOO, CLI04. Residence Requirement for the English Minor: Four upper\u00ad division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Major Sufficient competence in a foreign language, either modern or classical, to be able to read any standard literary or critical text in that language. If the student intends to continue with graduate work, the study of a second foreign language is highly recommended before graduation. Three quarters of lower-division work: Comparative Litera\u00ad ture majors are normally required to take CL 50A-B-C. Transfer students may be required to take one or more courses in the sequence depending on the courses they have taken previously. Normally 10 upper-division courses in addition: usually these will include CR IOOA, CL 100 twice, two courses (one 101 and one above 101) in a selected foreign language, or two lOis in two different foreign languages, or two years of a classical language; two courses from CL 103 or CL 104; three additional upper-division courses chosen from the offerings in comparative literature, English, literary criticism, and crea\u00ad tive writing. Courses in allied areas, e.g., history, philosophy, social science, may be counted toward the m\u00b7ajor if they deal with literary or philosophical texts, though prior approval of a faculty advisor is necessary. The Comparative Literature Program maintains a compre\u00ad hensive reading list in world literature, on which CL 50A-B\u00ad C is based. Students may, by prior arrangement with the Direc\u00ad tor of the Program, take an examination on one or more parts of the list and thereby become exempt from one or more quarters of CL 50A-B-C. Residence Requirement for the Comparative LiteratuJ;e Major: CR IOOA and four upper-division English or Compar\u00ad ative Literature courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor CL50A-B-C, CRIOOA, CLIOO, CLI03 or 104 (three courses), and one upper-division literature course taught in a foreign language. Residence Requirements for the Comparative Literature Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study Students should plan, with their faculty advisors, coherent programs of study, including undergraduate seminars, work\u00ad shops in writing (for students choosing a writing emphasis), and courses in allied areas outside the Department. It is pos\u00ad sible to combine a cluster of courses in literature with other majors in the sciences and social sciences, and to use an Eng\u00ad lish or Comparative Literature major as preprofessional train- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 138 English and Comparative Literature ing in government, law, medicine, etc. Students who wish advice in planning such programs should consult both the Department and people in their prospective professional areas. Students who intend to pursue a single subject or multiple subject teaching credential must consult with Professor Myron Simon (as well as with the Office of Teacher Educa\u00ad tion) to ensure that they understand the departmental and State requirements. A student who intends to continue with graduate work is urged to study a second foreign language before graduation. Graduate Program The Department's three principal areas of work on the undergraduate level-English and American Literature, Comparative Literature, and the English major with writing emphasis-are reflected in the graduate programs: the M.A. and Ph.D. in English, the M.A. and Ph.D. in Comparative Literature, and the M.F.A. in English (Creative Writing). A student's courses for the M.A. and Ph.D. in English may include or emphasize work in American literature as well; and the faculty is particularly equipped to guide students with special interests in criticism and theory, an area which candidates for the Ph.D. in English or in Comparative Litera\u00ad ture may stress in their qualifying examinations and disserta\u00ad tions. Ordinarily students are not admitted to the English or Comparative Literature programs unless they plan to con\u00ad tinue, and are qualified to continue, to the degree of Ph.D. Students are admitted to the M.F.A. program chiefly on the basis of submitted creative work. A committee of the Department, with the consent of the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research, admits students to these programs. Each program has a director appointed by the Department Chair. A deliberate effort is made to maintain close adminis\u00ad trative and intellectual ties among the programs. Specific requirements for the graduate degrees will be reached by consultation between members of the faculty and the candidate. The first-year graduate student or the candi\u00ad date for the Master of Fine Arts in English (Creative Writing) plans a program with an assigned advisor; candidates for the Ph.D. plan with an advisor and three-person committee. At the time of the M.A. examination, the Graduate Committee evaluates the student's graduate career up to that point and offers advice about future prospects. Candidates for literary degrees are encouraged to study philosophy, history, foreign languages and literatures, and the fine arts. Applicants for graduate degrees in English and Comparative Literature must submit scores for the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) including the Subject Literature in Eng\u00ad lish Test; applicants must also submit sample papers and a statement about competence in foreign languages. Only in exceptional circumstances will students be permitted to undertake programs of less than six full courses during the academic year. The normal expectation, however, is enroll\u00ad ment in three courses each quarter, except for Teaching Assistants, who take two courses in addition to earning credit for University teaching. Students who are not teaching should be able to complete course work in two years. The Ph.D. qualifying examination should be taken within a couple of quarters after courses are finished. Dissertations can fre\u00ad quently be written in a year. The Ph.D. in English or the Ph.D. in Comparative Literature normally should be com\u00ad pleted in six years or less. The Department recognizes that many of its graduate stu\u00ad dents intend to become teachers, and it believes that graduate departments should be training college teachers as well as scholars-indeed, that teaching and most literary scholarship complement one another. Thus the Department has initiated a program by which all its Ph.D. candidates, in English as well as in Comparative Literature, may gain supervised training as part of the formal seminar work required for the degree. M.F.A. candidates also have the opportunity to participate in this program. All those interested in graduate study in the Department should obtain the brochure on graduate programs from the departmental office. English Master of Arts in English Each candidate for the M.A. will be assigned to a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. The M.A. plan of study includes (1) the completion of course work, as advised, for three quarters or the equivalent; (2) demon\u00ad strated proficiency in reading a designated foreign language, modern or classical; and (.3) the submission of materials (including a statement about work accomplished and plans for future study, and a sample essay) to the Graduate Com\u00ad mittee, who will review and assess the student's progress, recommend whether further study toward the Ph.D. is advisable and, if so, give advice about areas for further study. Master of Fine Arts in English The Master of Fine Arts (M.F.A.) is a degree in creative writing. The M.F.A. degree is nqrmally conferred upon the comple\u00ad tion of a two-year residence. Each quarter the candidate will be enrolled in either the poetry or fiction section of the Graduate Writers' Workshop, which will constitute two\u00ad thirds of a course load, the other course to be selected in con\u00ad sultation with the student's advisor. It is expected that M.F.A. candida1es will complete at least one supervised teach\u00ad ing seminar. In addition to course work, the candidate is required to pass an examination on a reading list of literary works in the genre selected, and to present as a thesis an acceptable book\u00ad length manuscript of poetry or short stories, or a novel. Doctor of Philosophy in English The program for the Ph.D. in English requires about two years of full-time enrollment in regular courses beyond the B.A. (two courses of which may be in the graduate teaching program); proficiency in the reading of two acceptable for\u00ad eign languages, modern or classical; the dissertation; and satisfactory performance on designated examinations. The languages acceptable depend upon the nature of the stu\u00ad dent's program as determined by the student's advisors. Reading competence in one of these languages must be estab\u00ad lished in the first year of residence, and competence in the second well before the general examination. Students admitted at the post-M.A. level must provide evi\u00ad dence of satisfactory competence in foreign languages. Com\u00ad petence in one of the two languages required for the Ph.D. is verified through a course in theory and practice of transla\u00ad tion; the other language may be verified through examination. Upon completion of course work the student takes general examinations on literary theory and criticism; some particular literary form, genre, style, theme, or structure; a historical period; a group of authors; and a specific topic. The first four of these examinations are written; the fifth is oral. The stu\u00ad dent has the opportunity to present personal choices for the UC IRVINE - 1987-1988examination, but the choices must enable an individual to demonstrate breadth of knowledge as well as literary under\u00ad standing and therefore must be approved by the advisory committee. Upon satisfactorily completing the general examination and the oral Qualifying Examination, the student is admitted to candidacy for the degree. As soon after completion of the general examination as is practical, the student presents an essay leading to dissertation for the approval of the doctoral committee. The dissertation itself must also be approved by the committee, which may or may not require an oral exami\u00ad nation on it. All work for the Ph.D. degree must be in courses limited to graduate students. Comparative Literature There are at least four avenues by which the student may approach graduate work in Comparative Literature: 1. An undergraduate major in Comparative Literature equi\u00ad valent to the one described above; 2. An English major, provided that a sufficient background in at least one foreign language is demonstrated (a beginning on a second foreign language is desirable); 3. A normal major in drama, with same proviso as above; 4. A normal major in a foreign language, provided that a suf\u00ad ficient general background in world literature is demonstrated. Make-up work will be required before graduate studies can begin if one of these avenues has not been taken. At the graduate level, the study of Comparative Literature becomes more specialized, with the student engaged in a par\u00ad ticular area of research and concerned with such problems as the development of genres, interrelations between litera\u00ad tures, the theory and practice of translation, and other liter\u00ad ary questions transcending national boundaries. For the graduate student in Comparative Literature a profes\u00ad sional competence in foreign languages is essential. French and German are usually required for all doctoral candidates, since these languages along with English are the accepted tools of international literary scholarship. A classical language may prove indispensable for work in many traditional fields of literary study, and the scholar's own specialty may require the mastery of other languages. The underlying assumption of language requirements is that, after the tool languages have been mastered, the professional scholar's own interests should determine the specific kinds and degrees of language skill to be acquired. At the graduate level, the nucleus of the foreign language requirement is the course CL 220 (Problems in Translation) in which, after a suitable theoretical preparation, the student plans and carries out a high-quality translation of a literary text. The translation, along with an introduction or other scholarly apparatus explaining and defending the technical decisions involved in the task, is then submitted as a paper for course credit. Master of Arts in Comparative Literature Students entering the Master of Arts program should com\u00ad plete their course work in three quarters. This course work should include CL 220 (Problems in Translation) with a project in either French or German and appropriate graduate\u00ad level work in English, foreign languages, drama, comparative literature, and other areas as recommended by the advisor. Soon after beginning graduate work the student, with the advice and approval of the assigned advisor, will decide on a field of specialty, which will be emphasized in progressing English and Comparative Literature 139 toward the M.A. degree. (Normally this choice will be a pre\u00ad liminary step toward the selection of an area of specialty for the Ph.D.) Graduate study in Comparative Literature requires an excep\u00ad tional facility in foreign languages, and the student should not attempt a Master's degree without a thorough knowl\u00ad edge of one foreign language and literature and a consider\u00ad able knowledge of a second language. Normally the greatest part of the student's work will involve the study of literary texts in the original languages. At the end of course work, normally about nine courses at the graduate level, the student will be examined on a reading list in world literature that the student's committee has approved. This list should be designed by the student in con\u00ad sultation with the committee and based on the general World Literature list for Comparative Literature. The student's own list should follow some organizing principle, such as an emphasis on the fields and languages of the student's special\u00ad ization. Nevertheless, every list should include works from all of the different groups represented on the general World Literature list. The M.A. examination is a three-hour written examination, which focuses on essay questions based on the student's approved reading list. Exceptional students may be exempted from taking the examination by petitioning the Graduate Committee, which will review the student's per\u00ad formance and qualifications in arriving at its decision. Doctor of Philosophy in Comparative Literature The doctoral program is designed to prepare the student for a professional career as a scholar and critic of literature. Details of the doctoral program in Comparative Literature may be obtained from the Director of the Program in Com\u00ad parative Literature. Normally the degree requires two years of course work (usually a minimum of three courses per quarter). Of these courses, the only required course is CL 220 (Problems in Translation), which is taken twice, with projects in acceptable languages. The rest of the student's work will be in seminars or other graduate-level courses in Comparative Literature, English, the various foreign lan\u00ad guage departments, or drama. In general an exceptional command of foreign languages is required, normally involving a professional competence in two or more foreign languages, either modern or classical. The doctoral student is encouraged to design and carry out a personal plan of study (the area of specialty) in a particular field of interest. The requirements for the doctorate also include an area of competence in literary theory and practical criticism; a student may also stress theory in preparation for the Qualifying Examination. Upon completion of the course work, the student will be examined in the following areas of knowledge: (1) mastery of a limited topic in literary theory or history of criticism, along with general knowledge of major critical texts in the history of literature; (2) an area of specialty as described above; and (3) major works and authors appropriate to the study of comparative literature. Following this examination, and upon recommendation of a candidacy committee appointed by the Graduate Dean on behalf of the Graduate Council, the stu\u00ad dent is formally admitted to candidacy. The study toward the degree of Doctor of Philosophy will culminate in the writing of a suitable dissertation, normally on a comparative subject, although subjects lying within a single literature or dealing with general literary and aesthetic problems not confined to any specific literatures may also be acceptable. Studies of the relation between literature and the other arts are also encouraged.

The program in Film Studies recognizes the necessity of training students to become responsible citizens of modernity and thus equipped with the ability to confront and understand the visual signs and codes which surround them. The baccalaureate program in Film Studies provides a sys\u00ad tematic, historical, and comprehensive exposure to cinema, television, and modern media. In particular, it stresses the study of cinema with an emphasis on history, theory, and close analysis. The focus is on the critical analysis of film and other visual media. The curriculum presents a progressive and coherent sequence of courses, spanning the film medium's connection to other disciplines and art forms as well as film's historical development and its status as an institution and industry. Built around a coordinated pattern of classes, Film Studies courses familiarize students with the history, theory, and aes\u00ad thetics of cinema, national cinemas, individual filmmakers, period styles, genres, and television. Additional course work acquaints students with the practical and technical aspects of the film medium, the essentials of film production, and scriptwriting. Film Studies students participate in a highly creative and active educational experience outside of the classroom in reg\u00ad ular film series and visits by filmmakers, critics, and scholars. The School of Humanities charges a laboratory fee of $15 per course to all students taking Film Studies courses. Film Studies students have the opportunity to spend their junior year in France studying at the Inter-University Center for Film and Critical Studies in Paris, through the Univer\u00ad sity's Educational Abroad Program. Information is available both in the Film Studies Office and the Educational Abroad Program Office. Career Opportunities In addition to providing students with a solid grounding in humanistic studies to enable them to pursue a number of educational or business opportunities, a degree in Film Studies prepares students to seek a career as a film educator, to attend graduate school in film studies, to continue literary studies connected with film, and to work in the rapidly grow\u00ad ing entertainment industry, in either its commercial or inde\u00ad pendent sectors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132. Program Requirements for the Major: Humanities 50A, 101A-B-C-D, 110, 112 (two courses), and 115; two courses selected from the following: Humanities 111, 113, 114; Humanities 160 (three courses); and Humanities 199.

It seeks to enrich students' apprecia\u00ad tion of their own civilizations and to create a deeper sense of international understanding. The program brings the students to participate in the crea\u00ad tive process of language, to think in French or Italian as they learn to understand, speak, read, and write. Most classes are taught entirely in the foreign language, and a multiple approach stresses the interdependence of the four basic skills and makes them mutually reinforcing. The Language Labora\u00ad tory is used to complement classroom activity. All upper-division literature and culture courses are taught in the seminar mode. Because classes are limited in number of students, they promote and encourage participation and dis\u00ad cussion and facilitate direct contact with professors. Representatives chosen by the undergraduate French majors and by the graduate students serve on departmental commit\u00ad tees. These representatives also participate in Department meetings and are responsible for student evaluation procedures. Careers for the French Major The great majority of students who major in French pursue careers in various sectors of the world of business and com\u00ad merce, where they can take advantage not only of their com\u00ad petency in communicating in French but also of what they have learned from the study of French literature and civiliza\u00ad tion. The study of literature teaches students to think criti\u00ad cally and develops analytical skills; it also helps them to express their own ideas clearly and persuasively. In practical terms, these skills will allow them to operate efficiently in marketing, publicity, public relations, and management, where sophistication has become essential. A number of stu\u00ad dents also follow careers in education, continue their studies in graduate school, or enter the diplomatic service. Undergraduate Program in french While preparing the student for graduate work and for the teaching profession, the French major is essentially a liberal arts program offering a broad, humanistic course of study. At the intermediate lower-division level, texts of contempor\u00ad ary literary and social interest provide the focus for advanced conversation, reading, and composition. After the second year, courses in speaking (conversation and phonetics) and writing enable the students to attain a greater degree of proficiency, preparing them for further study in French literature and linguistics and in French civilization and culture. In the introductory courses in literature, complete texts are studied in historical context. The student learns to analyze and interpret different types of creative literature and is introduced to various critical concepts and vocabulary. At the French and Italian 143 more advanced level, literature courses may emphasize a sin\u00ad gle author, movement, or critical problem within a historical -period. The content of these courses changes yearly accord\u00ad ing to the interests of both faculty and students. Senior seminars are offered periodically to discuss literary problems which cannot be dealt with in depth in the regular offerings. Courses in civilization and culture explore aspects of French history, intellectual thought, and the arts. Courses are offered with a historical emphasis (for instance, the world of the Renaissance in France; the Age of Louis XIV; colonialism; anti-Semitism) and with a comparative orientation (for instance, poetry and painting; literature and society; women in literature; Paris and the history of art; literature and history). Courses in linguistics introduce students to aspects of the structure of the French language and to the application of linguistic techniques to problems of literary analysis. Students are placed in elementary and intermediate courses according to their years of previous study and their grades; placement examinations also are given. One year of high school is equated with one quarter of work at UCI. A student may not go back more than one quarter and receive credit. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132. Departmental Requirements for the Major French Major with Emphasis in Literature and Culture: French 11, lOOA-B, 101A-B-C, and eight other upper-division courses taught in French, at least six of which must be in literature, culture, or civilization. French Major with Emphasis in Linguistics: French 11, lOOA-B, 101A-B-C, two courses in French civilization, Lingu\u00ad istics 50, 110, 120, 130, and French 113, 131. Prospective ele\u00ad mentary and secondary school teachers who choose this option should take as electives additional courses in French language, civilization, and/or literature. Work in French civili\u00ad zation is required by State credentialing authorities. Residence Requirement for the Major: At least five upper\u00ad division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor French 100A-B plus five other French courses, four of which must be upper-division. Prerequisite: French 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement for the Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The student and the faculty advisor (assigned upon entering the major) should plan a coherent program of courses to ful\u00ad fill the literature and culture or the linguistics emphasis. The Department encourages the student to study in France, either through the University's Education Abroad Program or independently. Information is available in the Department Office. Students should consult with the departmental coordinator of advisors concerning career plans in the areas of teaching, industry, journalism, law, civil service, etc. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 144 French and Italian Undergraduate Program in Italian In addition to first-and second-year language courses, upper\u00ad division offerings provide an introduction to Italian literature and culture that serves as a basis for composition, conversa\u00ad tion, and phonetics. Tutorial and seminar courses are available for advanced stu\u00ad dents. Students are encouraged to pursue their interests through a major in Humanities, leading to a B.A. degree in Humanities, which combines Italian literature, culture, his\u00ad tory, art, and music. Graduate Program in French The Department's program of graduate study reflects its concern with the nature of both literature and the critical discourse it produces. Seminars focusing on relationships between literature and theory explore various critical approaches and engage related fields of inquiry such as his\u00ad tory, philosophy, aesthetics, psychoanalysis, women's studies, and anthropology. Master of Arts in French The Master of Arts degree is considered to be a step toward the Ph.D. degree; only students intending to pursue studies for the doctorate are admitted to the program. Performance on the Master's examination, usually given in the second year of graduate study, determines entrance into the doctoral pro\u00ad gram. Most candidates take a minimum of 11 graduate courses. Particularly well-prepared students may receive spe- . cia) permission to take a minimum of nine courses and to write a short thesis, for which two course credits are given. All entering graduate students are counseled by the graduate advisor. During the spring quarter of each year, the teaching performance and academic record of each student who is a Teaching Assistant are evaluated. All graduate students are also given a written evaluation of their work on a course-by\u00ad course basis. Proficiency in a foreign language in addition to French is required for the M.A. degree (proficiency is defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course 2C). All M.A. candidates are required to pass a written and oral comprehensive examination on material drawn from the class program and the Master's reading list. The student writes essays demonstrating skills of literary analysis and an under\u00ad standing of theoretical concepts and their application to the study of specific literary texts. The oral part of the examina\u00ad tion allows elaboration on aspects of the written examina\u00ad tion, but seeks as well to test the students' broader knowledge. The Master's examination is given in mid-fall quarter and at the end of winter quarter. Students who are Teaching Assistants normally take the examination in the fifth quarter of their studies. Doctor of Philosophy in French Upon successful completion of the Master's examinations and admission to the Ph.D. program, or admission with a Mas\u00ad ter's degree from an accredited institution, a Guidance Com\u00ad mittee is appointed to advise the candidate in the choice of courses to help prepare for the written and oral Qualifying Examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. The formal Guidance Committee is composed of three members from the Department, one from outside the Department, and in addition for the defense, one member who is not affiliated with the School. One member of the committee will be expected to direct the dissertation. Language Requirements: A reading knowledge of two for\u00ad eign languages relevant to the student's area of specialization and subject to the approval of the Guidance Committee. Course Requirements: A minimum of 18 graduate courses or seminars in French beyond the B.A., including one graduate course in French linguistics, one graduate course in writing and style, and three graduate courses outside the Depart\u00ad ment in areas related to the field of specialization are required. A student may pursue the Ph.D. with particular emphasis in literary theory by taking additional course work in the Department and in the Critical Theory Program beyond the minimum number required. Teaching: Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candi\u00ad dates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsi\u00ad bility to train them as teachers. Therefore, as far as it is pos\u00ad sible, all candidates without previous teaching experience are required to participate in a program of supervised teaching for at least one year. Qualifying Examination- Written and Oral: Upon comple\u00ad tion of course work, the student takes a series of written open book examinations involving problems of a critical and interpretive nature. The student may be given from one to three days to answer any part of the examination. The oral Qualifying Examination assesses the student's knowledge of French literature and understanding of agiven literary movement. The student will be examined on (a) five of the following sixperiods of French literature: Twentieth Century; or four of these periods plus the development of a single literary genre through all periods of French literature; (b) a given literary movement (e.g., Romanticism, Baroque, etc.) or problem in a non-French literature or an issue in critical theory. The writ\u00ad ten and oral parts of the examination are based both on material covered in the graduate seminars and on the Ph.D. reading list. Upon successful completion of the written and oral Qualifying Examinations, the student is advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Dissertation: The dissertation topic chosen by the candidate will normally, but not necessarily, fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. The disserta\u00ad tion must be defended in an oral examination and approved by the Doctoral Committee before the candidate is recom\u00ad mended for the degree. Three faculty members, chosen by the candidate, proposed by the Department, and appointed by the Graduate Council, constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the prepa\u00ad ration and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee supervises an oral defense, the focus of which is the content of the doctoral dissertation, and certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory.

Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lecturer in German and Linguistics (Germanic and applied linguistics, second-language acquisition, supervisor of Teaching Assistants) The Department of German sees its contribution in the con\u00ad text of the humanistic endeavor to understand and evaluate Western culture. We can understand ourselves and our immediate culture more clearly through the study of related but different languages and cultures. The Department offers courses on the German language and on German literature and film. The study of German literature is pursued from various critical perspectives. Some courses emphasize its his\u00ad torical, social, and political significance and setting; in others literature is approached as an imaginative experience which transcends its immediate context. The history of German literature and film, the theory of literature and literary criti\u00ad cism, and the relations of German literature to other litera\u00ad tures are also studied in the Department's courses. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Undergraduate Program The German major offers alternative emphases, one in litera\u00ad ture and another in linguistics. All courses in the Department are taught in German to the extent compatible with the aim of the course. In the basic courses the student will develop an understanding of the nature of the language, based on linguistic principles, while learning the necessary skills. Use is made of the Language Laboratory. At the end of the first year, students will have attained mastery of the basic structure of the language. At the intermediate and advanced levels the student's ability to read and write German will be developed gradually. A three-quarter, third-year course stresses composition and provides an introduction to contemporary German culture. It can be followed by a course in phonetics which aims to per\u00ad fect the pronunciation as well as to introduce historical and dialectal variants. The introductory course in literature, usu\u00ad ally taken in the third year, presents a first view of some periods of German literary history, familiarizes the student with German terminology used in the interpretation of liter\u00ad ature, and uses these concepts in practical interpretations. A certain number of courses in the series German 117, 118, 119, 120 will be designated as \"core courses\" which cover German literature from the Reformation to the present and are espe\u00ad cially recommended for majors. It is assumed that the student is familiar with basic concepts of literature in English. A further series of courses (German 130, 140, 160) treats ques\u00ad tions of theme and genre and topics in literary theory and criticism, as well as perspectives in German cinema. Students are given the opportunity to participate in programs of work and study abroad during the summer and the junior year. The University's Education Abroad Program has study centers in Gottingen and Vienna, among other locations. Certain courses taken while participating in the Education Abroad Program are recommended as contributing to fulfill\u00ad ment of the German major requirements. Students entering UCI with previous German training will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus students with one, two, three, and four years of high school German will normally enroll in German 18, IC, 2A, and 28 respectively. Exceptions to this placement procedure must have the approval of the director of first-or second\u00ad year German instruction. Credit is given for the Advanced Placement Test in German. Careers for the German Major German is excellent preparation for professional schools. It can be combined successfully with work in the natural sci\u00ad ences, business and management, and the computer sciences, and it is invaluable for advanced work in the humanities and the fine arts. The ability to speak and write German, when combined with other skills and specific training, can open up opportunities in communications, foreign trade and banking, transportation, government, science and technology, tourism, library services, and teaching. Recent graduates of the German Department have begun careers in international law, business, the foreign service, the airline industry, professional translating, journalism, and all levels of education, including university teaching. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132. German 147 Departmental Requirements for the Major German Major with Literature Emphasis: German IOOA-8- C; German 101; eight upper-division literature courses; and two courses selected from German 140, 150, 160, Linguistics 50, German 30, English and Comparative Literature CL SOA- 8-C, a course in German history, or a course in German phi\u00ad losophy, as approved by the advisor for the major. German 139 may not be used to satisfy major requirements. Students who plan to acquire a teaching credential, or intend to do graduate work in literature, are encouraged to take the major with literature emphasis. German Major with Linguistic Emphasis: German IOOA-8- C; German istics SO, 110, 120; one course selected from Linguistics 130, a Middle High German course, or a course in the history of the German Language; one course selected from German 140, ISO, 160. German 139 may not be used to satisfy major requirements. The German major with linguistic emphasis is recommended especially for students who intend to do graduate work in linguistics or enter a linguistics-related profession. Residence Requirements for the Major: At least five of the upper-division courses required for the major must be com\u00ad pleted successfully at UCI. At least four of the courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at ucr. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven upper-division courses, which must include German IOOA-8-C and German 101. Not more than one course from German 140, 150, or 160 may be counted for the minor. German 139 may not be used to satisfy minor requirements. Graduate Program In its graduate courses the Department stresses theoretical understanding of the nature of literature in its specific appli\u00ad cation to literature written in the German language. The Department also offers regular courses devoted to the his\u00ad tory, analysis, and theory of German film, viewing the medium in its relationship to other forms of expression as well as considering it as an art form in its own right. Courses also are offered elucidating the structure and history of the German language. The graduate program in German is essentially a program leading to the Ph.D. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of full-time graduate study. The Department will decide after completion of the M.A., at the latest, whether or not to permit the student to continue in the Ph.D. program. The M.A. thus may be in some cases a ter\u00ad minal degree. In those cases where the student enters the UCI graduate program in German with an M.A. from another institution, the Department will evaluate the stu\u00ad dent's progress during the first year of study before deciding to allow continuation toward the Ph.D. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 148 German Master of Arts in German Before entering the program, a candidate is expected to have the equivalent of our undergraduate major. Students with a bachelor's degree in another subject may be considered for admission. Normally their course of studies will have to be extended in order to make up for the deficiency. However, each case is considered individually by the faculty. The min\u00ad imum course requirement for the M.A. degree is nine courses, eight of which must be taken within the Depart\u00ad ment of German. Reading knowledge of a foreign language other than German also is required for the M.A. degree. Whenever possible, a candidate is urged to complete this requirement before entering the program. Further require\u00ad ments follow. The Preparation of a Reading List. All candidates should pre\u00ad pare as early as possible a list of works read in the field of German literature, both primary texts and critical works. This list should preferably be augmented by critical texts and by works from other literatures which, in the candidate's opinion, relate to the German works in the list. Since it should ultimately contain representative selections from various eras of German literature and some works of criti\u00ad cism, a tentative list must be discussed with the graduate advisor before the end of the fall quarter of the year in which the candidate expects to receive the M.A. Candidates should indicate on the list a number of works with which they are especially familiar. In its final form (including works read dur\u00ad ing the course of study both in and out of class) the list will be submitted together with the essay two weeks before the oral examination. It is the student's responsibility to keep the reading list current. The Master's Essay. The purpose of the written part of the M.A. comprehensive examination is to show the candidate's methodological progress in interpreting German literature. It consists of an essay in which a text is elucidated and related to: (a) pertinent works by the same author, (b) its social and historical context, and (c) other works of German or other literatures with which the candidate is familiar. The level of the discussion will normally be enhanced by the candidate's knowledge of the relevant secondary literature. The topic of the essay should be tentatively formulated and reported to the graduate advisor before the end of the second quarter of the student's residence. The Oral Examination. During the oral examination the fol\u00ad lowing items will be discussed: (a) the essay, (b) the reading list. The discussion based on the reading list will focus on works which the student knows well, but may broaden into other areas. One Course in University Teaching (399) One Year of Residence Ph.D. in German The Department requires a minimum of 22 approved courses from students entering with a bachelor's degree. These may include courses in philosophy, history, comparative literature, etc., suitable for the individual student's program of study. The course Introduction to Middle High German and one course in medieval German literature are required. The stu\u00ad dent also will participate in each of the German Department's colloquia. The student will augment the reading list and keep it current during the whole course of study. At least two years of residence are required. Students entering with the master's degree will be advised individually as to remaining course requirements. Since the majority of Ph.D. candidates choose careers as teachers, the German Department recognizes its obligation to offer them preparatory experience. Therefore, all candi\u00ad dates for the Ph.D. are required to teach under the supervi\u00ad sion of a faculty member at least one course in each of three quarters (for which they will receive credit as German 399). Three of these courses may be counted toward the 22 courses required for the Ph.D. Comprehensive Examination. There are two parts to the examination. In order to fulfill the written examination requirement the student will choose either (1) to present a lecture to the faculty and to the other graduate students, or (2) to write a three-part examination (one part on a signifi\u00ad cant author, one on a major genre, and one on an historical period) within a period of two weeks. These examination essays may be either closed-book or take-home, by agree\u00ad ment with the candidate's examination committee. The exam\u00ad ination essays or the lecture will be on a text or texts selected by the faculty from a reading list submitted by the student for the comprehensive examination. The second part of the comprehensive examination is the formal oral qualifying examination of up to three hours duration ranging over the whole field of the student's studies, to be taken within two weeks after completion of the written examination. The stu\u00ad dent will submit the reading list at least two weeks before the written examination after consultation with the members of the examination committee. Language Requirements. The candidate must demonstrate reading competence in two languages or extensive compe\u00ad tence in one language other than German or English. Choice of language(s) depends on the student's area of specialization. French and Latin are recommended. For the various ways in which these requirements may be fulfilled, the student should see the graduate advisor. Dissertation. Toward the end of the second year of study, the student should formulate a tentative dissertation topic. Three faculty members proposed by the Department and appointed by the Graduate Council constitute the Doctoral Committee which directs the preparation and completion of the disserta\u00ad tion. The Doctoral Committee certifies that a completed dis\u00ad sertation is satisfactory through the signature of the Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page of the dissertation.

The Department offers a variety of approaches to history, and each emphasizes basic disciplinary skills: weighing evidence, expository writing, constructing logical arguments, and exploring the role of theory in historical analysis and human action. In addition to offering a number of lower-division history courses open to nonmajors, the Department requires all His\u00ad tory majors to participate in an introductory core course, His\u00ad tory 29A-B-C. This is a comparative course that acquaints students with the modern world by examining some of the basic characteristics of modernity and by focusing on the his\u00ad toric process of modernization in different societies over time. The Department has established a minor in History, designed for students who are interested in the study of history but who are majoring in other disciplines. The program incor\u00ad porates the main elements of the Department's program for majors but allows students enough flexibility to pursue pro\u00ad grams in other departments and schools. From this introductory course the student moves on to a ser\u00ad ies of upper-division courses, the contents of which range from the examination of individual nation-states (e.g., British History), to studies of the relations among nation-states (e.g., European International History), to historical analyses of political, socio-economic, and cultural factors (e.g., Women and the Family in the United States). Students are also pro\u00ad vided the opportunity for small-group learning experiences in a series of colloquia in the following areas: social history, political history, international history, intellectual history, social thought, and comparative history. The colloquia are conducted as discussion groups and involve close reading and analysis of secondary texts. The senior seminar is a two\u00ad quarter research seminar in primary materials that cul\u00ad minates in the writing of a research paper. Faculty members in the Department of History work closely with their students. All upper-division History majors are assigned a faculty advisor, whom they are encouraged to consult at least once each quarter. Careers for the History Major The training and discipline derived from historical studies provide a valuable experience for all educated persons seeking to understand themselves and their world. Many students who complete undergraduate degrees in the Department of History go on to graduate school in a variety of fields, includ\u00ad ing history, law, business, international relations, and teacher education. The study of history is valuable preparation for many other careers as well. The strong academic and profes\u00ad sional orientation acquired by History ma:jors is necessary to pursue successful careers in such diverse fields as advertising, banking, journalism, management, public relations, publish\u00ad ing, and government service. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132. Departmental Requirements for the Major Fourteen courses are required, including History 29A-B-C (for which transfer students may substitute such year-long surveys as European, American, Asian, or Latin American history); at least five upper-division historical studies courses; at least one colloquium and one senior seminar (a two-course sequence) or three colloquia; and three additional courses (which may be drawn from lower-and upper-division offerings). Residence Requirement: Three historical studies and a senior seminar (or two colloquia) must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Minor Seven courses are required, including either at least one quarter of History 29 or at least one quarter of History 50. (Minors are encouraged to take the full History 29 sequence.) At least four of the remaining six courses must be upper\u00ad division History courses and must include two colloquia or one senior seminar. Residence Requirement: At least four upper-division History courses must be completed successfully at UCI. Graduate Program The graduate program leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in History is designed to provide students with both basic historical skills and a rigorous grounding in historical theory. This combination of theoretical study with training in histor\u00ad ical method reflects the Department's conviction that schol\u00ad ars should be encouraged to deal with significant questions about the past and to approach these questions in a methodo\u00ad logically sophisticated way. This approach requires that the student develop the critical abilities necessary to deal with primary sources, secondary syntheses, and the interrelation\u00ad ship of history and thebry. Candidates for any advanced degree in History are expected to gain teaching experience as an integral part of their graduate training. Ordinarily this is accomplished through service as a Teaching Assistant or Associate. Basic to the Department's curriculum is a year-long course in History and Theory which deals with both theoretical texts and historical studies that have utilized theoretical concepts and models. The History and Theory course also examines the phenomenon of modernization the general world trans\u00ad formation of the past four hundred years and seeks to under\u00ad stand the social institutions through which this process has occurred. The course directs attention to the diverse implica\u00ad tions of modernity, to the groups who dominated and were dominated by it, and to the costs and benefits of the process. These matters can be studied most satisfactorily by the histo\u00ad rian whose theoretical self-consciousness and methodological facility have been systematically and carefully developed. A three-quarter research seminar is offered every year and is required of all graduate students (including those entering with an M.A. degree). This course offers guidance in the selection of significant research topics, the formulation of coherent statements of historical problems, the carrying out of projects of original research, and the writing of research papers. The colloquium, a reading course that examines the chief his\u00ad torical works in a \"time-place\" field, enriches the student's knowledge of the main areas of historical research and devel\u00ad ops critical reading skills. Colloquia are offered yearly in American history and Modern European history, and biannu\u00ad ally in Early Modern European history, Latin American his\u00ad tory, and Ancient history. A student may prepare a disserta\u00ad tion in any of these fields. In addition, independent reading UC IRVINE - 1987-1988and research courses are provided for advanced, specialized study in tutorial form. The immediate objective for the doctoral student is to develop four fields of competence in preparation for a com\u00ad prehensive examination. These fields are: history and theory; first \"time-place\" field (field in which the dissertation is writ\u00ad ten); second \"time-place\" field; \"focus\" field (such as social, political, intellectual, or international history). The subsequent objective, to write a distinctive dissertation, is of crucial importance. To assist in accomplishing both . objectives, the Department offers intensive consultation with the faculty as well as a lively intellectual atmosphere. Stu\u00ad dents have long shared in the decision-making processes of the Department, which engages the entire historical commu\u00ad nity at Irvine in the collective pursuit of excellence. Students profit also from a vigorous visiting speakers program that brings scholars from other campuses and other nations to meet and interact with UCI students and faculty. Master of Arts in History Requirements for Admission. Although it is desirable that an applicant have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in History, the Department also accepts students who have pre\u00ad viously specialized in other subject areas and who show promise of sustained and self-disciplined work in history. Typically, a minimum undergraduate grade point average of 3.0 (B) is required for admission, with evidence of better work in history. In addition, all applicants are asked to submit three letters of recommendation, scores from the Graduate Record Examination, and examples of written work in his\u00ad tory from their undergraduate classes. Students living in Southern California should plan to come to UCI for an inter\u00ad view with the Department Chair or the Coordinator of Graduate Advising. Students are accepted for admission for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is March 1. Program of Study. The M.A. program emphasizes the theo\u00ad retical and historical dimensions of the field in general, and of European, American, or Latin American history in particular. Each candidate for the M.A. will choose a graduate advisor who will supervise the student's program. Nine courses are required for the degree: three in History and Theory (History 200A-B-C), three in \"time-place\" colloquia (taken in sequence, as a unit), and three in the Research Seminar. Stu\u00ad dents intending to pursue the Ph.D. should begin at once to delineate doctoral interests in order to fit their work for the M.A. into the total program. Language Requirement. Normally a reading knowledge of one foreign language is required for the M.A. degree. Stu\u00ad dents in American history, with an advisor's permission, may substitute a one-quarter departmental course in quantitative studies for the M.A. foreign language requirement. Language proficiency is usually demonstrated by passing a departmen\u00ad tal exam administered by a faculty member proficient in the chosen language; students can also fulfill the requirement by achieving a score of 500 or more on the appropriate ETS examination. Comprehensive Examination. At the end of the final quarter the M.A. candidate must pass a comprehensive oral examina\u00ad tion covering the student's major field (e.g., American, Early Modern Europe) and focusing upon material assigned in the three-quarter \"time-place\" colloquium series. Time Limits. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than two years of graduate study. History 151 Doctor of Philosophy in History Requirements for Admission. Applicants submit transcripts, three letters of recommendation, example(s) of written work, and aptitude scores from the Graduate Record Examination. In addition, a departmental interview may be required. Ph.D. students are advised to begin their graduate work at UCI, since those who have taken the M.A. elsewhere will be expected to enroll in the same courses that are required of all incoming students. In the second and third years, the greater experience of those who enter with an M.A. may work to advantage in speeding them to examinations. To be admitted formally into the doctoral program, students must satisfactorily pass a departmental evaluation at the end of their first year of study; this includes students who entered with an M.A. from another institution. Incoming students are admitted for fall quarter only, and the deadline for application for fall admission is March 1. Program of Study. The Department requires doctoral stu\u00ad dents to prepare themselves in four different areas: 1. History and Theory. 2. The first \"time-place\" field (such as Modern Europe), which is designed as a teaching field as well as the focus of the student's dissertation. 3. The second \"time-place\" field (such as American History), which is designed as a second teaching field. 4. A \"focus\" field (such as social history), which is designed to enhance the student's capability for dealing with the prob\u00ad lems and phenomena of the field, to make comparisons, and to introduce the student to the theory and method of rele\u00ad vant related disciplines (e.g., sociology). The courses required in this preparation include the History and Theory sequence, colloquia series in both time-place fields, and the Research Seminar sequence. The normal aca\u00ad demic load is three courses. per quarter. However, some applicants may be eligible for approved part-time status, which allows students to take a lighter course load at reduced fees. Every doctoral student will be assisted by a departmental advisor in the student's general area of study who will be responsible for approving defined fields, guiding the student to consultant faculty, and supervising the examinations. Language Requirements. All students, except as specified below, must demonstrate a reading knowledge of one foreign language relevant to the field of graduate study, no later than the end of the second year in the program. Normally, comple\u00ad tion of the M.A. foreign language requirement will fulfill this requirement. Proficiency usually is established by passing a departmental examination administered. by a faculty member proficient in the chosen language; students can also fulfill the requirement by obtaining a score of 500 or more on the appropriate ETS examination. Students in American history who have opted for a language substitute in completing the UCI Master's degree will be allowed to submit this work in fulfillment of the alternate skill requirements discussed below, and will not be subject to the time limit in achieving a foreign language competence. Additional language requirements depend on the subject the student selects for the first \"time-place\" field and must be met before the student takes the candidacy qualifying exami- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 152 History nations. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in Amer\u00ad ican history may either demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second useful foreign language (by passing a language examination designed by a faculty member or by achieving an ETS score of at least 500), or complete, as a doctoral student, a sequence of courses in an alternate skill (e.g., statistics, lin\u00ad guistics) that will be useful in mastering the chosen historical fields. An individual with a first \"time-place\" field in a non\u00ad American subject must demonstrate a reading knowledge of a second foreign language. Qualifying Examinations and Dissertation. After completing the appropriate courses and other preparatory work, the stu\u00ad dent will take written examinations in the History and The\u00ad ory and two \"time-place\" fields, followed by the oral Qualify\u00ad ing Examination in the \"focus\" field, first \"time-place\" field, and dissertation topic. Upon successful completion of these examinations, the student will be advanced to candidacy and will begin intensive work upon the dissertation. The research and writing involved in this effort are expected to require from one to two years. At the end of this period an oral defense of the dissertation will be held, focusing on the ade\u00ad quacy of the student's research and thesis. Students who enter with normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years.

UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Humanities/Women's Studies 155 Courses in the Emphasis in Women's Studies focus on the cultural role of women, women's history, and the socioeconomic condition of women, Attention is given not only to traditional perspectives, but also to how these issues are undergoing change in the modern world, Special Programs in the Humanities Undergraduate Major in Humanities The interdisciplinary major in Humanities is one of the many options available to a student who wants to select a major in the School of Humanities. As such, the major in Humanities is on a par with the major in Spanish, the major in Classics, the major in Linguistics, and other majors in the School. The major in Humanities accommodates students who want to organize their undergraduate education around a humanistic perspective on a topic, a field, or a problem which is interdis\u00ad ciplinary in scope (e.g., Literature and Politics in Twentieth\u00ad Century America; The Problem of Community; Social and Religious Thought in the Age of the Reformation). The stu\u00ad dent enters the program at the end of the sophomore year and, in consultation with the Humanities Major Committee, devises an individually tailored set of \"major requirements,\" not all of which need be offered in the School of Humanities. The Committee will assign an advisor on the basis of the student's own preference, if possible. At the end of the senior year the student will prepare, under the advisor's super\u00ad vision, a long paper in the area of the special major. This requirement is satisfied by taking Humanities 199. A student majoring in the Humanities must also meet the regular School, UCI, and University requirements for graduation. (See p. 48 and p. 132.) Inquiries by third-quarter sophomores should be addressed to the academic counselors in the School's Office of Undergraduate Study. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses in Humanities required for the major must be completed suc\u00ad cessfully at UCI.

As an interdiscipli\u00ad nary course of study, the Emphasis in Women's Studies offers an opportunity for reflection upon these relationships from a variety of perspectives and from the broadest point of view. Courses focus on the cultural role of women, women's his\u00ad tory, and women's socioeconomic condition, as all of these have been conceived traditionally and as they are currently undergoing change in the modern world. The value of pursu\u00ad ing this Emphasis at this time will continue to increase as women come more and more to take positions of decision\u00ad making and leadership in determining the future shape and direction of cultural and social life. The Emphasis equips stu\u00ad dents with the proper critical tools for accomplishing the his\u00ad torically unprecedented tasks with which they are faced in contemporary life. Career Opportunities The degree in Humanities with an Emphasis in Women's Studies affords the student several options in diverse career fields in both the public and private sectors: several leading universities have begun to offer graduate training in women's studies; businesses and corporations, as more women join the workforce, are discovering needs for special\u00ad ists in women's studies; and the growth of women's organi\u00ad zations, women's research centers, and women's resource organizations across the country and around the world (including the United Nations) indicate that opportunities for people with backgrounds in women's studies are growing and should continue to grow in the foreseeable future.

Though the Concentration as such can be elected by any student in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology, the courses of the Concentration are open to all UCI students. Participants in the Concentration must complete the equiv\u00ad alent of nine courses, beginning in the sophomore year with an introductory series and culminating with the Peace and Conflict Forum and its related Seminar, usually taken during the senior year. The student selects the remainder of the courses comprising the Concentration from an approved list of upper-division courses and must organize these choices in consultation with a panel of the participating faculty into a coherent interdisciplinary program complementary to the student's major. Humanities/Global Peace and Conflict Studies/Religious Studies 157 Requirements for the Concentration: Three lower-division courses: History 11 (Introduction to Peace and Conflict), Social Science 26 (The Nuclear Arms Race), Physics 16 (Physics of Nuclear Weapons) Five relevant upper-division courses. Among those usually offered are: History 146B (American Foreign Relations Since World War II), Social Sciences 123G (U.S. Foreign Policy), Social Sciences 123 (U.S. National Security), Social Sciences 113E (Political Economy of National Defense), Social Sciences 122A-B (Soviet Society and Politics), History 133A-B-C (European International History), Philosophy 182 (Issues in Social Philosophy), History 195 (Arms Control Simulation), Humanities 198, Social Ecology 178, 179, 180 (Social Ecology of Peace), Social Sciences 161Z (War, Peace, and Gender). With approval of the Global Peace and Conflict Studies faculty, relevant lower-division courses may be substituted for up to two of the five upper-division courses. A minimum of two quarters of Humanities 180 (same as Social Sciences 123S or Social Ecology E184)-Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum-total of two units maximum for credit. One quarter of Humanities 181 (same as Social Sciences 123T or Social Ecology E185)-Peace and Conflict Seminar\u00ad totaling two units, taken during winter quarter of the senior year. Further information concerning the Concentration in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is available from selected faculty representatives in 535 Social Science Tower, 300A Humani\u00ad ties Office Building, or 356 Social Ecology Building. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repres\u00ad ented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building.

Ph.D. with Interdisciplinary Emphasis in Humanities The School of Humanities offers no degree called the Ph.D. in Humanities. However, some Ph.D. students in regular programs in the School may elect an interdisciplinary modifi\u00ad cation of their degree with the permission of the departments or programs concerned. Such students will do about 60 per\u00ad cent of their graduate work in a major field and about 40 per\u00ad cent in one or more minor fields. At least one of the student's courses will be in the Humanities series 200-230. Those interested in an interdisciplinary degree should contact the Associate Dean for Graduate Studies or the Graduate Ad\u00ad visor in their major department. Emphasis in Critical Theory An Emphasis in Critical Theory, under the supervision of the Committee on Critical Theory, is available for doctoral stu\u00ad dents in all departments of the School of Humanities. Each Ph.D. student in Humanities may, with Committee approval, complete the Emphasis in addition to the degree require\u00ad ments of the student's graduate program. Although there is no change in the existing Ph.D. program requirements or procedures, if the student wishes to have a letter (signed by the Dean and by the Director of Critical Theory) testifying that the student has satisfactorily added this theoretical dimension to the graduate program, then additional require\u00ad ments must be met: these consist of a sequence of courses in theory, a theoretical section on the qualifying exam, and a theoretical component in the dissertation. Critical theory at Irvine is understood in the broad sense as the study of the shared assumptions, problems, and commitments of the vari\u00ad ous discourses in the humanities. The faculty regards critical theory not as an adjunct to the study of one of the traditional humanistic disciplines but as a necessary context for the study of any humanistic discipline. In recognition of the interdisciplinary nature and goals of crit\u00ad ical theory, the Committee on Critical Theory coordinates the activities of theorists from literary, historical, philosophi\u00ad cal, and linguistic fields of study. The membership includes: David Carroll, Professor, Department of French and Italian; Director, Focused Research Program in Critical Theory Lucia G. Cunningham, Associate Professor, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Jacques Derrida, Professor, Department of English and Com\u00ad parative Literature Alexander Gelley, Professor, Department of English and Comparative Literature Wolfgang Iser, Professor, Department of English and Com\u00ad parative Literature Murray Krieger, University Professor of English, Depart\u00ad ment of English and Comparative Literature Jean-Francois Lyotard, Professor, Department of French and Italian David McDonald, Associate Professor, Drama, School of Fine Arts J. Hillis Miller, Distinguished Professor, Department of Eng- lish and Comparative Literature Jane Newman, Assistant Professor, Department of German Mark Poster, Professor, Department of History John Carlos Rowe, Professor, Department of English and Comparative Literature David Smith, Professor, Department of Philosophy Juan Villegas, Professor, Department of Spanish and Portuguese Each year at least six graduate courses in critical theory are offered: a three-course sequence designed to introduce stu\u00ad dents to major theoretical issues and their historical settings, from Plato to the mid-twentieth century; and at least three advanced seminars which build on the student's historical competence in order to probe topics of contemporary inter\u00ad est. Additional theory courses are offered by several\u00b7 departments. The Focused Research Program (FRP) in Critical Theory is an important resource for graduate students in Humanities doc\u00ad toral programs. To acquaint Humanities graduate students with the most recent developments in the field, the FRP augments its teaching and research resources by inviting vis\u00ad iting theorists for varying periods of residence. The campus library has strong holdings in critical theory, and students also have access to the resources of the recently acquired UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Rene Wellek Collection of the History of Criticism. The annual Wellek Library Lecture Series provides for an extended dialogue with major contemporary theorists. For further information, please contact the Committee on Critical Theory, School of Humanities, University of Califor\u00ad nia, Irvine, CA 92717, (714) 856-6722. Emphasis in the History and Philosophy of Science An emphasis in the history and philosophy of science is avail\u00ad able for doctoral students in the Departments of History and Philosophy. The Emphasis is administered by the Committee on the History and Philosophy of Science. Student partici\u00ad pants must fulfill special course, examination, and disserta\u00ad tion requirements. Graduate Courses Graduate courses in Humanities are under the direction of the School's Associate Dean for Graduate Studies. These courses are designed for all graduate students in the School of Humanities, with the exception that students in philosophy may not count Humanities 230 as part of their degree program. Humanities 200, 210, 21 2, 220, and 230 introduce study in five disciplinary areas, either to students planning a degree in history or one of the literature departments or to those seek\u00ad ing familiarity with disciplines other than their own.

Voge, Ph.D. University of California, Berkeley, Lecturer in German and Linguistics (second language acquisition, language teaching, applied linguistics, German linguistics) (See also the School of Social Sciences for additional faculty in Linguistics.) Linguistics is concerned with descriptions of human lan\u00ad guages, with theories that seek to explain the nature of lan\u00ad guage, and with the various uses of language. Additionally, linguistics has potential relationships with other disciplines concerned with language. The undergraduate major in Linguistics is offered by the School of Humanities and by the School of Social Sciences. The UCI campus programs are administered by an inter\u00ad school Linguistics Committee. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests. A Linguistics minor is also offered. There are three ways to major in Linguistics as an under\u00ad graduate. They are designated as Tracks I, II, and III. Track I, General Linguistics, will appeal to students who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of Lin\u00ad guistics. Track I may be taken either through the School of Humanities or through the School of Social Sciences. Track II, Theoretical and Formal Linguistics, will appeal to stu\u00ad dents interested in areas of the cognitive sciences such as psychology and artificial intelligence. Track II may be taken through either the School of Humanities or the School of Social Sciences. Track III, Applied Linguistics (Language Teaching and English as a Second Language), will appeal to students interested in language teaching including but not limited to the teaching of English as a second language. Track III is available through the School of Humanities. Students may also major in Classics, French, German, and Spanish with an emphasis in Linguistics. Students are encouraged to consider a double major in Lingu\u00ad istics and either English or a foreign language. This is espe\u00ad cially recommended for students following Track III. Stu\u00ad dents who double major may not satisfy requirements in one major with courses which count for the other major, unless the same course is required for both majors. Careers in Linguistics A major in Linguistics prepares students for a wide variety of careers in teaching, law, publishing, and public service, among others. Linguistics at UCI is also excellent preparation for graduate work in a number of areas. General Linguistics prepares students for advanced work in the field; Theoretical and Formal Linguistics students may continue work in formal linguistics, psychology, or other areas in the cognitive sci\u00ad ences; and those who concentrate in Applied Linguistics may pursue careers in the teaching of English as a second lan\u00ad guage or in other language teaching.

Each discipline inevitably poses prob\u00ad lems concerning the nature of the standards appropriate to it and the place of its subject matter within the total framework of human knowledge. If we are to understand science or art or literature, or such human practices as morality and re\u00ad ligion, we are bound to address ourselves to philosophical issues relating to their nature, the uses of reason appropriate to them, and the contributions they make to our understand\u00ad ing and appreciation of ourselves and the world in which we live. Careers for the Philosophy Major The study of argument and the precision and clarity of thought and writing required of Philosophy majors are excel\u00ad lent preparation for a variety of careers. Many undergradu\u00ad ates trained in philosophy go on to professional schools in medicine, business, or law. The analytical skills developed in philosophy courses seem to be especially useful in legal edu\u00ad cation; indeed, many UCI philosophy graduates have estab\u00ad lished fine records at top law schools. Former philosophy stu\u00ad dents also have used their skills to advantage in careers in government, business, teaching, law enforcement, and com\u00ad puter programming. Many Philosophy majors also continue their education at the graduate level, either in philosophy or a related discipline. Undergraduate Program Instruction in philosophy relies essentially upon discussion in which students are active participants. Wherever possible, therefore, classes are severely limited in size in order to per\u00ad mit sustained dialogues between student and instructor. Some of the courses offered are of general interest to all stu\u00ad dents. Others are designed to explore issues that arise in selected and special disciplines. Among these are courses in the philosophy of science and of art. The staff should be con\u00ad sulted for advice about courses best suited to the specialized needs of particular students. The program of course offerings is also designed for those majors in philosophy whose intention may be either to enter some professional school upon graduation (e.g., law) or to engage in graduate work in philosophy. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132. Departmental Requirements for the Major Philosophy 30, Philosophy 10 and 12 and either 11 or 13; two of the following: Philosophy 140A-B, 145A-B, or 170A-B; four additional quarter courses from Philosophy 101-199. Students planning to go on to graduate school are strongly advised to take Philosophy 130.

UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Graduate Program Students are encouraged to seek the counsel of any and all members of the Department whose recommendations the student would deem helpful. It is hoped that there will be a close intellectual relationship between graduate students and professors in order to provide the students with optimum conditions for philosophical development and to expedite their progress toward advanced degrees. In addition, the Department sponsors a series of colloquia each year. Partici\u00ad pation in these colloquia is an important part of the graduate student's training. Every new graduate student is assigned a committee of faculty members whose purpose is to oversee the student's progress through the major requirements for the advanced degree. The student consults with the committee each quar\u00ad ter about progress and any administrative or academic diffi\u00ad culties. Each student's overall record is evaluated by the Department each year, customarily during the first two weeks of March. When the student has satisfied residency, language, logic, and portfolio requirements, the Candidacy Committee supervises the qualifying examination and the development of a dissertation project, and the subsequent writing of the dissertation itself. The Chair of this committee is the principal person with whom the graduate student will consult on the dissertation. Master of Arts in Philosophy There is no list of courses required for the M.A. degree. The M.A. program in Philosophy takes one year at a minimum. The student may elect to follow either of the following routes to the degree: write a thesis on a subject to be chosen in consultation with an advisor and defend the thesis in an oral examination, or satisfy the Logic and Portfolio require\u00ad ments for the Ph.D. (see below). Please refer to the Graduate Studies and Research section for information on the min\u00ad imum number of courses required for the M.A. degree. Advancement to candidacy for the M.A. degree is not auto\u00ad matic, but requires formal application to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research via the Philosophy Department Office. Application must be made with the recommendation of the Philosophy Department and must take place before the beginning of the \u00b7quarter in which the student expects to receive the degree. Doctor of Philosophy in Philosophy There is no set number of courses required for the Ph.D., thus allowing course work to be tailored to the individual student's needs and interests. However, as a prerequisite for the Ph.D. degree, every student is required to have some experience in teaching. The Ph.D. program is designed to take four years for the normally qualified student. In exceptional cases it may be possible to obtain the degree within three years. A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for the Ph.D. The following five items are requirements for the Ph.D. degree. Tools of research, to be satisfied by demonstrating profi\u00ad ciency in a single appropriate foreign language* or by passing with a grade of B or better five to six courses at the graduate *The foreign language examinations are administered by the Department of Philosophy. They are two hours in length and con\u00ad sist of translating, with the aid of a dictionary, passages from two authors. Students wishing information as to courses to prepare them for these examinations and dates when these examinations will be given should consult the Philosophy Department Office, 500 Humanities Office Building, telephone (714) 856-6525. Philosophy 165 level in a discipline or disciplines outside of the Philosophy Department. Approval for the latter alternative will be granted by the Department only if, in its judgment, the courses form an integrated unit in light of the student's research interest. Logic Requirement: Students entering the program are expected to be familiar with elementary quantification theory and some natural deduction techniques. If they are not, stu\u00ad dents may take Philosophy 30 (no graduate credit is given for this course). In the Ph.D. program, students must complete with a grade of B or better Philosophy 230A-B and an additional course requiring substantial use of logical or mathematical tech\u00ad niques. Philosophy 230A covers the syntax and semantics of first-order logic with identity, including a proof of the com\u00ad pleteness theorem. The content of Philosophy 2308 varies and covers advanced topics in mathematical logic, including recursion theory and Godel's incompleteness theorem, higher order logic and type theory, and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory. Courses which satisfy the third-course requirement include courses in mathematical and philosophical logic, mathematics, computer science, and mathematical social science; others may be permitted by the Department on a case-by-case basis. \u00b7Portfolio of papers representing the student's best work in philosophy. The papers may be, or may be based upon, essays written for course work. Papers will be evaluated by the faculty for the purpose of determining whether or not the student is ready to seek admission to candidacy. Breadth Requirements. Historical Breadth: To be satisfied by receiving a grade of B or better in at least four courses cover\u00ad ing at least three of the following five historical periods: Ancient, Medieval, Modern, Kant and nineteenth-century, and twentieth-century. Field Breadth: To be satisfied by receiving a grade of B or better in one course in metaphysics, one course in epistemology, and two courses in value theory. Both breadth requirements must be satisfied by the end of the seventh quarter of graduate study. Advancement to candidacy and the writing of a thesis. Upon successful completion of the above requirements, the student will apply for advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree by filling out the appropriate forms and returning them to the Philosophy Department Office. A Candidacy Committee including one or two members from an 'lcademic area outside of Philosophy is then appointed by the Graduate Council. This Committee administers an oral Qualifying Examination to determine whether the student is qualified to begin work designed to lead to the completion of a thesis. Upon passing this oral examination, the student becomes a candidate for the Ph.D. degree. The Doctoral Committee appointed by the Graduate Council supervises the student's further course work and research, as well as the actual writ\u00ad ing of the doctoral thesis. The defense of the thesis. At a suitable point during the development of the thesis, the Doctoral Committee adminis\u00ad ters an oral examination, the focus of which is the content of the thesis itself. If at all possible, this examination will be given while the student is still in residence. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 166 Philosophy Undergraduate Courses I Problems of Philosophy (4).

Green, Ph.D. University of California, Los Angeles, Director of the Program in Russian and Associate Professor of Rus\u00ad sian (eighteenth-century Russian theatre and literary theory, Pushkin, Chekhov, Kuzmin, Russian Symbolist theater, Russian literature and theater of the 1920s, relations between literature and the arts, Russian painting and music) Guy de Mallac, Ph.D. Cornell University, Professor of Russian (mod\u00ad ern Russian literature, peace studies, philosophy of nonviolence, Tolstoy's thought, Gandhi's thought, religious studies, Russian intellectual thought, Pasternak's life and work) Helen Wei!, M.A. California State University, San Diego, Lecturer in Russian (Russian language and methodology, contemporary Soviet prose, Russian culture and civilization, nineteenth-and twentieth-century Russian literature, male and female role mod\u00ad els in Russian fiction, contemporary guitar poetry, Ukrainian language) Russian is a language spoken by 215 million people in the Soviet Union and ranks with English and Chinese as one of the three major world languages. Russian is a language of the Indo-European family and is thus related to English, French, and German. Russian is an infinitely rich language, as is Eng\u00ad lish, and adapts itself well to a variety of styles and genres from lyric poetry to the seeming harshness and brashness of the futurist poets. For the first two years, the Program in Russian emphasizes a combination of speaking, writing, and reading skills. At the end of the senior year, the student can expect to have attained a rather high level of proficiency in all language skills-reading, writing, speaking, and understanding. By then students will have read a number of selected literary texts-including a fair portion of the significant master\u00ad works-in the original. They will also have familiarized themselves with some of the historical background of the language and with its relation to other Slavic and European languages. And they will have achieved a reasonable degree of familiarity with the major cultural and social trends in Russian history and thought. In addition to the regular Russian major with emphasis on language and literature, the Program in Russian offers a modified major with emphasis on linguistics. This major was designed for those students who have no plans to pursue advanced study in Russian literature, while they wish to focus on the study of the structure of Russian viewed within the framework of Slavic and general linguistics. The Program in Russian also offers a major with an emphasis in Russian civilization, which is geared to the interests of students who do not intend to specialize in Russian language and literature. This emphasis is based upon a multidiscipli\u00ad nary approach (through language, the arts, thought, litera\u00ad ture, history, study of institutions) to the rich variety of a culture that both before the Revolution and during the Soviet period has made an important contribution to man\u00ad kind's cultural heritage. Various specializations and challeng\u00ad ing new career possibilities in today's world are available to students electing this option. Two minors are also offered by the Program. The Russian Language minor is geared to the student who already has a good command of the language and who wishes to streng\u00ad then language skills while acquiring knowledge of Russian literature in the original. Students whose main interests are cultural and historical will find the Russian Area Studies of value.

Students planning to major or minor in Russian should con\u00ad tact the Program Office to obtain the most current informa\u00ad tion. Students entering UCI with previous training in Rus\u00ad sian will be given advanced standing as follows: In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. Thus, students with one, two, three, and four years of high school Russian will enroll in Russian IB (or lOB), IC (or IOC), 2A (or llA), and 2B (or liB), respectively. Exceptions to this ruling can be made but must have the approval of the Program Director. Students with high school training in Russian should consult with the Russian staff before enrolling in Russian courses. The Self-Paced Courses: lOA-B-C/llA-8-C During the .regular academic year, the Program in Russian offers students a self-paced option in the first and second years of language study. The Self-Paced Courses are designed to accommodate students who cannot attend regular class meetings, or who wish to progress toward language compe\u00ad tence at their own pace (please see IOA-B-C and llA-B-C). Students interested in enrolling in the Self-Paced Courses should contact H. Wei!, Coordinator. UCI Summer Russian Institute and Practicum In planning their programs of study, students should note that certain courses bearing the designation Summer are also offered within the three-week UCI Russian Institute and Practicum (Russian IA-B-C, 199, 220, 290, and The UCI Russian Language Institute is a three-week, total-immersion program in Russian lan\u00ad guage and culture for students of all levels, conducted in Russian and encompassing all of the student's daily activities. The Practicum adjunct of the Institute affords prospective and practicing language teachers an opportunity for intensive language review and participation in established and experi\u00ad mental teaching methods.

Residency Requirement for the Russian Area Studies Minor: Four upper-division courses must be successfully completed at UCI. Planning a Program of Study The Program in Russian believes in close consultation with students on academic advising, program planning, and discus\u00ad sion of goals and direction. Students planning to major in Russian with an emphasis on literature or on linguistics are strongly urged to consult with the departmental faculty as early as possible, in order to familiarize themselves with the nature of the various programs. After indicating an intention to major in Russian, the student is assigned to an academic advisor who will help in the task of selecting courses toward the completion of one of the three options open to students majoring in Russian studies at UCI. Special attention is paid to the unique aspects of the Russian field. In particular, students' attention is alerted to the com\u00ad bined academic and career implications and potentialities of these major options. Career Opportunities The major in Russian may lead to a career with the federal government, in private enterprise, or in education. The U.S. Departments of State, Defense, Health and Human Services, the Information Office, and the Library of Congress all hire people who can speak and write Russian. The United States Information Agency's Voice of America offers oppor\u00ad tunities in research, scriptwriting, editing, translating, and announcing. Because of the importance of Russia in world politics and economics, private businesses and corporations dealing in the international marketplace increasingly employ persons skilled in Russian language and knowledgeable about Russian soci\u00ad ety and political institutions. Individuals with degrees in Rus\u00ad sian may find employment in private enterprise as interpre\u00ad ters and translators in the following areas: library science, communications media, science, and technology. Students who major in Russian may either go on to graduate programs or enter a career in education. Many students have entered teaching at the secondary level, while others, after graduate work in education, seek positions at colleges and universities. Since Russian is second only to English as a world language of science, the study of Russian provides access to a large body of the world's scholarly, scientific, and technical litera\u00ad ture. While the study of Russian language, literature, and civ\u00ad ilization provides training that may lead to careers similar to those described above, the major program is viewed primarily as a valuable component of a liberal education and an instru\u00ad ment for the investigation and appreciation of the modern world.

Students are placed in Spanish courses according to their years of previous study and a placement test. In general, one year of high school work is equated with one quarter of UCI work. All courses in Spanish and Portuguese, unless specifically stated, are taught in the foreign language. By the end of the first year, students attain mastery of the basic structure of the language and ability to converse on everyday topics as well as to read and write on an elementary level. In the second year, emphasis is put on gradually raising the level of the student's ability to read and write. A third-year course of two quarters stresses composition as opposed to translation. Further, a course in phonetics perfects pronunci\u00ad ation and presents historical and dialect variants of Spanish. The introductory courses in literature, also in the third year, emphasize the analysis and appreciation of complete literary works by genre rather than the study of many short selec\u00ad tions of innumerable authors in an anthology. The courses in Hispanic civilization combine a panoramic overview with a close look at a specific country or topic. Although no major in Portuguese is offered, advanced litera\u00ad ture courses are available. In addition, an undergraduate minor is offered. Students are encouraged to participate in programs of study abroad during the summer and the junior year. Elected representatives of the undergraduate majors, the graduate students, and the Teaching Assistants participate with full voting rights in Department meetings. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See page 132. Departmental Requirements for the Major Core: Spanish IOA-B, lOlA-B-C-0; Spanish 110A, B, or C; Spanish 113A. In addition, the student must choose one or more of the following emphases: Literature and Culture: Seven upper-division courses in literature. Two courses in Hispanic culture and civilization may be substituted. Linguistics: Linguistics 50, Spanish 113B plus any three selected from the following: Spanish 187, Spanish 200, or Linguistics 140; Spanish 201 or Linguistics 130; Spanish 205. Also, students must take two additional upper-division Span\u00ad ish linguistics or linguistics courses. Students are encouraged to take the Spanish linguistics courses in their senior year. Students may double major in Spanish and Linguistics but may not count the same course for both majors. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language: Spanish lOOA; Spanish lOOB or 115; Spanish 113B; Spanish plus 133A or B; Spanish 134A or B; one upper-division literature course. In addition, students are required to take Spanish 110C of the core curriculum. For students who plan to teach Spanish, the following courses are strongly recommended: Linguistics 50, Linguis\u00ad tics 140 (Second Language Acquisition), Spanish 113B (Span\u00ad ish Linguistics). Also, Spanish 200 and Spanish 204 should be taken as seniors or as members of the credential program. Residence Requirement: At least five upper-division courses required for the major must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental Requirements for the Spanish Minor Seven c.ourses in Spanish, including Spanish lOA and lOB and at least four upper-division courses. Prerequisite: Spanish 2C or equivalent. Residence Requirement: At least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Departmental requirements for the Portuguese Minor Prerequisite: Portuguese lC or the equivalent. Requirements: Seven upper-division courses: Portuguese 140A-B, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145. (These are offered on a two-year cycle.) Career Opportunities Spanish is particularly useful in international business or trade, community or social service, and in the foreign service. Spanish majors interested in writing may look to publishing, writing, or editing positions. Majoring in Spanish is excellent preparation for graduate and professional study in law, medicine, social welfare, library science, business or public administration, education, interna\u00ad tional relations, journalism, or advanced study in Spanish. An option available to Spanish majors is UCI's 3-2 Program offered by the Graduate School of Management, in which students may earn a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Management in five years rather than the usual six. Bilingualism and English as a Second Language are very use\u00ad ful preliminary emphases for many of the fields described above. These areas are closely related to the teacher prepara\u00ad tion program offered by the UCI Office of Teacher Education for students interested in the Bilingual/Cross Cultural Emphasis credential. Graduate Program in Spanish and Portuguese Master of Arts in Spanish The candidate is expected to have the equivalent of the UCI undergraduate major. The student takes a minimum of 11 courses, eight of which must be at the graduate level. Two of the 11 courses must be in linguistics. Spanish 239A, Methods of Literary Criticism, is required of all literature majors. A maximum of two courses may be transferred from another university, but a maximum of five may be accepted from another University of California campus. Proficiency (defined as the equivalent of the level attained at the end of course UC IRVINE - 1987-19882C) in a foreign language other than the major language is required. The comprehensive examination, in part written, in part oral, will be based both on a reading list and the courses taken by the students and will also test the students' ability to express themselves correctly in Spanish. No thesis is required. The student may choose an emphasis in literature or linguistics. The M.A. requires a minimum of one year in academic residence and must be completed in no more than three years of graduate study. Normally only students who are studying for the Ph.D. are admitted to the graduate pro\u00ad gram. The comprehensive examination for the M.A. may be accepted as the written portion of the qualifying examination for the Ph.D. M.A.T. in Spanish This program is specifically directed at meeting the needs of working credentialed teachers, although others may apply. It seeks to provide a group of modern, relevant courses that will enable teachers to keep abreast of recent developments in their field. It is structured so that working teachers can take courses in late afternoons. Applicants should have a B.A. in Spanish and should acquire proficiency in a foreign lan\u00ad guage other than Spanish. The program consists of 10 courses (eight of which must be at the graduate level) as fol\u00ad lows: three courses in Hispanic literature; three courses in Hispanic civilization; three courses in Hispanic linguistics; and one course in Recent Trends in Foreign Language Teaching, to be combined with a curricular research project or a thesis. M.A.T. students are counseled by a faculty member in the Department. Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The bilingual/cross-cultural emphasis is a specialization in addition to the regular teaching credential for high school (Single Subject) or elementary school (Multiple Subject). Undergraduates may plan from the beginning to aim for this emphasis by choosing the track in Bilingualism and English as a Second Language. See page 295. Ph.D. in Spanish The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a Ph.D. degree with a minor in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature. The program attempts to integrate period and genre studies with work in literary theory, linguistics, and socio-historical studies. A number of courses outside of the Department are required. The Department thereby hopes to aid in the formation of Ph.D. candidates who are not narrow specialists but rather scholars acquainted with the various fields that relate to their discipline. The Department is con\u00ad cerned also with the practical aspects of helping its graduates become good teachers. The secondary field can be Spanish literature, Spanish\u00ad American literature, Chicano studies, Spanish linguistics, literary theory, comparative literature, or a non-Hispanic literature. Language Requirements A reading knowledge of Portuguese and two other languages relevant to the student's area of specialization is required. Advanced study in one of these languages may be offered in lieu of the reading knowledge of the other. The choice of languages requires Department approval. Course Requirements A minimum of 23 courses is required for the Ph.D. as follows: A Two graduate courses in linguistics, diachronic and syn\u00ad chronic (the students who select Linguistics as a secondary Spanish and Portuguese 173 field will substitute two courses in either Spanish or Spanish-American literature); Spanish 239A-B; a course on the socio-historical context of the period of the stu\u00ad dent's specialization; a course in Brazilian or Portuguese literature (preferably related to the student's specializa\u00ad tion); two courses outside of the Department in non-lberic literatures; two courses in Spanish or Spanish-American literature, whichever is not the major. Ph.D. candidates should take one course in each genre within their area. B. Additional courses for the major and the secondary field: 1. Ten courses in the major, including one course on the\u00ad ory of the genre. Those students who major in twentieth-century Spanish-America n literature are required to take Spanish 238A-B: Spanish-American Literature in the Colonial Period and in the Nineteenth Century. 2. Three courses in the secondary field. Candidates who have the M.A. degree from another univer\u00ad sity will be interviewed by two professors representing peninsular and Spanish-American literature, in order to eval\u00ad uate their past studies in terms of our doctoral program; it is recommended that the student's graduate advisor direct the doctoral dissertation and that the choice of dissertation and director be made as early as possible. Each incoming graduate student will be assigned a faculty advisor who will supervise the student's program and with whom the student should meet at least once each quarter. All graduate students will be formally evaluated at the end of each year by the faculty with whom they have studied. Students pursuing a full-time pro\u00ad gram of study ordinarily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree within six years or less. Teaching Since the overwhelming majority of Ph.D. candidates plan to teach, the Department recognizes its responsibility to train them as teachers. Therefore, all Ph.D. candidates without previous teaching experience are required to teach under supervision and at UCI one course in each of three quarters. All Ph.D. students will student-teach in an upper-division course related to the major. This will count as one of the required courses in the major. Comprehensive Examination The student is admitted to candidacy by passing, by a major\u00ad ity vote, an oral examination administered by a Candidacy Committee appointed by the Graduate Council. The Candi\u00ad dacy Committee is composed of five members, of whom four will be from the Department. The oral examination will be preceded by a written examination as follows: A The student, in consultation with the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee, may choose one of the following options: 1. A comprehensive examination including a dissertation project. The student will then take parts 1, 2, and 3 of the examination described below, and will submit a dis\u00ad sertation project. 2. A comprehensive examination including the minor instead of the dissertation project, part 4 of the exami\u00ad nation described below. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 174 Spanish and Portuguese B. The written comprehensive examination will consist of three parts: 1. A genre in all periods. The student will demonstrate knowledge of literary theory and methods of literary criticism. 2. A historical literary period, including all of the genres and the socio-historical context. 3. Textual analysis. A representative text in the student's genre of specialization will be given to the student at the time of the examination. If the genre is poetry, the text may be a complete poem or a section from a larger poem. In the case of the short story, novel, theatre, or essay, a relatively brief organic section will constitute the text. The student's analysis should be intrinsic; it should also demonstrate the relationship of the text to the total work as well as to the author's total produc\u00ad tion and the author's position in the literary history of the country or the continent. 4. Dissertation project. During the year preceding the comprehensive exams, the student will write a disserta\u00ad tion project of approximately 40 typewritten (double\u00ad spaced) pages which will be turned in one month before the comprehensive exams. The topic as well as the dis\u00ad sertation advisor will be chosen by the student. The essay should: a. Define clearly the topic of the dissertation and jus\u00ad tify it by discussing its significance. b. Discuss previous studies on this topic and prove the originality of the new study. c. Describe and justify the critical method to be followed. d. Include a bibliography of special, general, and theo- retical works. Dissertation A dissertation topic will be chosen by the candidate and nor\u00ad mally, but not necessarily, will fall within one of the major fields covered by the Qualifying Examination. Three faculty members appointed by the Graduate Council will constitute the Doctoral Committee which supervises the preparation and completion of the doctoral dissertation. The Doctoral Committee supervises a final examination, the focus of which is the content of the dissertation. Ordinarily, the final examination will not be given after the dissertation is completed, but rather at an appropriate point during its development. Such final examination normally will be given while the graduate student is in residence at UCI. The Doc\u00ad toral Committee certifies that a completed dissertation is satisfactory through the signatures of the individual Com\u00ad mittee members on the title page.

Moore Dean The School of Physical Sciences offers both professional training and general education in the Departments of Chem\u00ad istry, Mathematics, and Physics. The faculty, active in research and graduate education, are at the same time vitally concerned with undergraduate teaching. Curricula of the School are designed to meet the needs of a wide variety of students ranging from those with little technical background who seek insight into the activities and accomplishments of physical scientists to those seeking a comprehensive under\u00ad standing that will prepare them for creative research in phys\u00ad ical science. Over the course of the past century and a half, physics, chemistry, and mathematics have evolved into interdepen\u00ad dent but separate intellectual disciplines. This development is reflected in the departmental structure of the School of Phys\u00ad ical Sciences. In the same period, these fundamental disci\u00ad plines have moved into domains of abstraction unimagined by early scientists. This trend to abstraction with its concom\u00ad itant increase in understanding of the physical universe pro\u00ad vides the major challenge to the student of the physical sci\u00ad ences. Mathematics, physics, and chemistry, while providing the foundation of the technology that dominates contempor\u00ad ary civilization, underlie to an ever-increasing extent the new developments in the biological and social sciences. In recognition of the contribution students can make to the academic affairs of the School, a variety of responsibilities on School and departmental committees is given to undergradu\u00ad ate and graduate students. Criteria used by the School of Physical Sciences in selecting candidates for honors at graduation are as follows: Approxi\u00ad mately 1 percent will be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude. Honors are awarded on the basis of a student's performance in research and cumulative grade point average. The School of Physical Sciences also grants special honors to students who have dis\u00ad tinguished themselves by their work in their major subject. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Undergraduate Programs Each department offers courses that are of value to non\u00ad majors and majors in the sciences. The programs for majors are designed to meet the needs of students planning careers in business or industry, of students planning advanced pro\u00ad fessional study, and of students planning graduate work that continues their major interest. Introductory courses in chem\u00ad istry, mathematics, and physics meet the needs of students majoring in the sciences, mathematics, and engineering and are also appropriate for students in other disciplines who seek a rigorous introduction to the physical sciences. In addi\u00ad tion, a number of courses within the School have few or no prerequisites and are directed particularly toward students majoring in areas remote from the sciences. Planning a Program of Study Every undergraduate student who has chosen to major in Physical Sciences is assigned a faculty advisor. The name of this advisor is communicated to the student prior to enroll\u00ad ment or may be obtained from the Office of the Associate Dean or of the appropriate Department Chair. Students are free to change academic advisors at any time. Each depart\u00ad ment also has a Chief Academic Advisor who is responsible for interpreting degree requirements and dealing with special advising problems. An academic advising and counseling staff is also employed in the Associate Dean's Office and is avail\u00ad able to serve a broad range of student advising needs. In con\u00ad sultation with the advisor, the student should plan a course of study leading to a major in one of the departments of the School. In carrying out this major, the student may often concentrate very heavily in a second department within the School or in some other school. Occasionally students choose to pursue a double major. Permission to do so may be sought by a petition submitted to the Office of the Associate Dean of Physical Sciences. All initial courses of study for majors include mathematics through calculus, and calculus is a prerequisite for much of the upper-division work in each major. A student interested in any of the physical sciences should continue mathematical training beyond these prerequisite courses. Furthermore, students interested in either physics or chemistry will usually include work in both of these subjects in their undergraduate careers. Students in the physical sciences are urged to acquire a work\u00ad ing knowledge of computer programming at an early stage of their University studies. This can be done by taking Informa\u00ad tion and Computer Science 21 or Engineering 10. Career Opportunities The majority of UCI Physical Sciences graduates continue their education beyond the Bachelor's degree level. Many pursue advanced academic degrees in preparation for careers in scientific or medical research, engineering, or postsecon\u00ad dary education. Some students enter professional school in areas such as medicine, dentistry, law, or business adminis\u00ad tration. Students who choose not to continue their studies beyond the baccalaureate level most frequently find employ\u00ad ment in private business or industry. In addition to technical areas directly related to their mafor fields of study, students often enter careers in less obviously related fields such as computing, systems analysis, engineering, journalism, mar\u00ad keting, or sales. The Career Planning and Placement Center provides services to UCI students and alumni including career counseling, information about job opportunities, a career library, and workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques. See page 66. 3-2 Program Physical Sciences majors who are interested in a career in management may wish to apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. Students normally apply for this program early in their junior year. See the Graduate School of Management section for further information. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements In addition to the courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI breadth requirement, students with a major in the School of Physical Sciences are required to take one additional approved three-course group chosen from one of the follow\u00ad ing breadth categories: Category III (Social and Behavioral UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Physical Sciences 177 Students in Fundamental Physics conduct lab work in the areas of special relativity and thermodynamics. Physics majors may choose to concentrate in applied physics or biomedical physics, in addition to their regular physics studies. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 178 Chemistry Sciences); Category IV (Humanistic Inquiry); or the Language and Linguistics section of Category V. For purposes of this requirement, the approved sequences are the same ones listed for the UCI breadth requirement, with the exception that any three consecutive foreign language courses are acceptable. The lower-division courses in the Concentration in Global Peace and Conflict Studies (History 11, Physics 16, and Social Sciences 26D) also constitute an approved sequence for this requirement. Graduate Programs A program of course work and research leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees is offered in each of the three departments of the School. The individual programs are described in the following announcements of each department. Department of Chemistry Robert T.

The curriculum of the Department is designed to satisfy the diverse needs of these students and others who may have occasion to study chemistry. The year course Chemistry 1A-B-C is prerequisite to all study in the Department at more advanced levels. The subject matter of this course serves also as a thorough intro\u00ad duction to the varied aspects of modern chemistry for stu\u00ad dents who do not wish to pursue their studies beyond this introductory level. Chemistry 51A-B-C is a one-year sequence in organic chemistry which is required for Chemis\u00ad try majors and for students of the life sciences. Certain more advanced courses required of Chemistry majors may also be of particular interest to the latter groups, among others. The undergraduate program of the Chemistry Department emphasizes close contact with research. Chemistry majors are urged to engage in research or independent study under the direction of a faculty member. Much of the important chemical literature is being and has been printed in foreign languages, principally Gennan, Rus\u00ad sian, and French. Reading competence in one or more of these languages is desirable, and many graduate schools require the demonstration of such competence as a prerequi\u00ad site for an advanced degree. Chemistry majors are encour\u00ad aged to acquire this competence. Chemistry majors who are interested in teaching chemistry at the secondary level are urged to consult with their ad\u00ad visors and with the Office of Teacher Education early in their undergraduate careers. Chemistry majors who plan subse\u00ad quent study in medical, dental, or other professional schools should request information concerning admission require\u00ad ments directly from the schools which they seek to enter. Those intending to pursue graduate studies in chemistry should discuss their plans with their academic advisors. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See pages 176-178. Departmental Requirements Basic Requirements: 131A-B-C or 130 A-B-C, Chemistry 151. Electives: Four courses chosen from the elective list below. These must include at least two courses offered by the Chemistry Department (Chemistry 180 may be counted no more than once, and Chemistry 192, 194, and 199 may not be counted) and at least one of the laboratory courses in the fol\u00ad lowing laboratory course group: Chemistry 152, Chemistry 153, Chemistry 160, Chemistry170, Physics 150, Physics 151, Physics 152, Physics 153. Elective List: Chemistry 125, 135, and all Chemistry courses numbered 152-235, Bio. Sci. 106 (Biochemistry), Bio. Sci. 107 (Molecular Biology), Physics 111A-B (Classical Mechanics), Physics 112A-B (Electromagnetic Theory), Physics 113A-B-C (Quantum Physics), Physics 115 (Statistical Physics), Physics 116 (Thermodynamics), Physics 132 (Nuclear Physics), Phys\u00ad ics 133 (Condensed Matter Physics), Physics 134 (Modern Optics), Physics 150 (Electronics for Scientists), Physics 151 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 152 (Advanced Laboratory), Physics 153 (Advanced Laboratory). Scientific Breadth Requirements: A total of six additional four-or five-unit courses chosen from the offerings of the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Information and UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Computer Science, and the School of Biological Sciences. (These may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis subject to the usual restrictions on Pass/Not Pass enrollment.) Planning a Program of Study The departmental requirements leave the student a great deal of latitude in choice of courses; the student can choose to pursue interests ranging from biochemistry on the one hand to chemical physics on the other. Many of the basic require\u00ad ments above coincide with those of the School of Biological Sciences. For this reason a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences does not require much extra course work. The Department is approved by the American Chemical Society to offer an undergraduate degree certified by the Society as suitable background for a career in chemistry or for graduate study in chemistry. While it is not necessary, it is desirable for students to pursue a course of study that the Department judges to merit a certified degree. Specifically, the following courses should be included in the program of study: Mathematics 3 (any two quarters); Chemistry 152 and 153; Chemistry 160, 170, or 180. These courses must be taken for a letter grade. Students should consult with their academic advisors on courses of study. A Chemistry major normally takes Chemis\u00ad try lA-B-C and lLA-LB-LC, Mathematics 2A-B-C, and required writing courses during the freshman year. The sophomore year should include Chemistry SIA-B-C and SILA-LB-LC; the Physics SA-B-C and SLA-LB-LC sequences should be completed no later than the fall quarter of the jun\u00ad ior year. The balance of the freshman and sophomore pro\u00ad gram can be chosen at the student's discretion with consider\u00ad ation given to progress toward completion of the School of Physical Sciences breadth requirement, the UCI breadth requirement, and the Chemistry Department scientific breadth requirement. In the junior year all Chemistry majors should enroll in the year sequence of physical chemistry (Chemistry 13IA-B-C or 130A-B-C) and in Chemistry 107 (fall) and 151 (winter). During the junior and senior years the Chemistry Department electives requirement should be ful\u00ad filled, as should other University, School, and departmental requirements. There is no foreign language requirement, but Chemistry majors are urged to obtain reading competence in a foreign language through course work. Sample Program -Chemistry Chemistry 179 Outlines of several typical programs of study for Chemistry majors, American Chemical Society-certified Chemistry majors, and Chemistry-Biological Sciences or Chemistry\u00ad Physics double majors have been prepared. A sample pro\u00ad gram for the Chemistry major is shown below. Sample .pro\u00ad grams for students considering double majors or other spe\u00ad cialized curricula are available in the Departmental Office. Graduate Program The Department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Chemistry. The Ph.D. degree is granted in recognition of breadth and depth of knowledge of the facts and theories of modern chemistry and an ability to carry out independent chemical research demonstrated through submission of an acceptable doctoral dissertation. The M.S. degree may be earned either through submission of an acceptable Master's thesis (Plan I) or through an approved program of graduate course work (Plan II). A Master's degree is not a prerequisite for admission to the Ph.D. program. Upon entering the graduate programs, all students are required to take a series of Area Examinations which test the students' competence in the general areas of chemistry (e.g., organic, physical, inorganic) at the undergraduate level. The Area Examinations are designed to ensure a proper funda\u00ad mental level of preparation for graduate study and are used as a guide in choosing the appropriate program of course work for each entering student. Students in the Ph.D. program are expected to demonstrate their knowledge of chemistry at the advanced level through satisfactory completion of a series of Cumulative Examina\u00ad tions. These examinations are designed to encourage the independent study of chemistry through reading of the clas\u00ad sic and current chemical literature and attendance at advanced seminars and colloquia. Normally, beginning with the second year of graduate study, students must take the monthly examinations until four have been passed. This requirement must be satisfied within 12 consecutive Cumula\u00ad tive Examinations. Following completion of the Cumulative Examination requirement, participants in the Ph.D. program take an oral examination for formal Advancement to Candidacy. This examination normally comes in a student's third graduate This sample program is designed to meet the needs of students wishing to major in chemistry while retaining sufficient flexibility to allow for development of other interests. Students interested in pursuing the American Chemical Society cer\u00ad tified degree, or a double major in Chemistry and Biological Sciences, are encouraged to seek advice about program plan\u00ad ning from a counselor or faculty advisor early in their academic career.

The committee may examine the student at this time on any subject it deems relevant to the independent pursuit of chemical research. Students in the Ph.D. and M.S. Plan I (Thesis) programs are required to complete a minimum of seven approved courses, including six graduate-level courses in chemistry. The M.S. Plan II (Course Work) program requires that the student complete 10 graduate-level chemistry courses. Graduate stu\u00ad dents are expected to attain grades of B or better to remain in good academic standing. Training in teaching is an integral part of each graduate pro\u00ad gram, and all graduate degree candidates are expected to par\u00ad ticipate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate career. The most important component of the Ph.D. program is the doctoral dissertation, which must describe the results of orig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a faculty member of the Department. The criterion for acceptability of the dissertation is that its contents be of a quality suitable for publication in a scientific journal of high editorial standards. Each Ph.D. candidate is expected to pre\u00ad sent the work described in the completed dissertation in a seminar before the Department, following which the candi\u00ad date will be examined in public on the contents of the disser\u00ad tation by a committee of the faculty. A Master's thesis pre\u00ad sented in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the M.S. under Plan I must also describe the results of a student's orig\u00ad inal research performed under the direction of a faculty member. However, no public oral defense of the Master's thesis is required. Residency requirements specify a minimum of six quarters in residence at UCI for Ph.D. candidates and three quarters for M.S. candidates. Some faculty from the Department of Chemistry are members of an interdisciplinary biophysics and biophysical chemistry group. The program provides an opportunity for interaction among graduate students and faculty from a number of UCI departments who share common interests in biophysics and biophysical chemistry. Participating graduate students pursue a degree in the department best suited to their own background and research interests. A program of seminars brings the group together to discuss research prob\u00ad lems of mutual interest, and a regular series of interdiscipli\u00ad nary courses is offered by the participating faculty to provide formal instruction in areas encompassed by biophysics and biophysical chemistry. See page 89. The following lists specify requirements for each of the graduate programs offered by the Department of Chemistry.

The curriculum in mathematics includes opportunities for supervised individual study and research, and is augmented by seminars and colloquia. It is designed to be compatible with curricular structures at other collegiate institutions in California in order to enable students transferring to UCI to continue their programs of mathematics study. The Depart\u00ad ment maintains an LSI-11-based minicomputer and a number of programmable calculators that are available for student and faculty use and that supplement the campus Computing Facility. Undergraduate Program Undergraduate mathematics courses are of several kinds: courses preparatory to advanced work in mathematics, the exact sciences, and engineering; courses for students of the social and biological sciences; and courses for liberal arts stu\u00ad dents and those planning to enter the teaching field.

UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 186 Mathematics In addition to formal courses, there are seminars for advanced study toward the Ph.D. in various fields of mathe\u00ad matics. Topics will vary from year to year. Each seminar is conducted by a staff member specializing in the subject studied. Enrollment will be subject to the approval of the instructor in charge. Master of Science in Mathematics The Master's program serves a dual purpose. For some stu\u00ad dents it will be a terminal program of mathematics education; for others it will lead to study and research at the doctoral level. To earn the Master of Science degree, the student must satisfy course, language, and residency requirements, and pass a comprehensive examination administered by the Graduate Studies Committee of the Department. There are three areas of concentration: Pure Mathematics, Applied Mathematics, and Applied Mathematical Statistics. Each concentration requires the satisfactory completion of 12 upper-division or graduate courses; this includes a core of nine courses (36 units), in each of which the student must earn a grade of B (3.0) or better, and three elective courses (9 to 12 units). At least eight of these courses must be at the graduate level (200-series courses). The specific requirements are described below. A grade point average of at least B (3.0) is required for all courses applicable to the M.S. degree. The student's selection of alternative or elective courses must be approved by the Graduate Studies Committee. The nine required core courses for the Pure Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C, Mathematics 220A-B-C, and Mathematics 230A-B-C. The student must complete three additional approved courses. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematics concentration are Mathematics 210A-B-C,\u00b7 Mathematics 220A-B-C and the A-B-C sequence of one of the following: Mathematics 201, 292, 295, or Physics 212. The student must complete three additional approved courses; these may be selected from the immediately preceding list. The nine required core courses for the Applied Mathematical Statistics concentration are Mathematics 201A-B-C and 201LA-LB-LC, Mathematics 202 and 202L, Mathematics 204A-B and 204LA-LB, and three additional approved gradu\u00ad ate courses in Mathematics or an appropriate applied area. The student also must complete Mathematics 129A-B-C and 129LA-LB-LC. Mathematics 199, 298, 299, and 399 may not be used to fulfill the course requirements for the Master's degree. Ordinarily, the final examinations in the courses listed below will comprise the comprehensive examination for the Mas\u00ad ter's degree. Pure Mathematics: Mathematics 210C, 230C. Applied Mathematics: Mathematics 210C, 220C, and the C part of the third one-year core course. Applied Mathematical Statistics: Mathematics 201C, Mathematics 202, and Mathematics 2048. The student must satisfy the language requirement for the Master's degree by demonstrating reading proficiency in French, German, or Russian. Proficiency in a higher level programming language may be substituted for French, Ger\u00ad man, or Russian only for the Master's degree with concentra\u00ad tion in applied mathematical statistics. The residency requirement for the Master's degree ordinarily is satisfied by full-time enrollment for three quarters imme-diately preceding the award of the M.S. degree. When appro\u00ad priate, a leave of absence may be granted between matricula\u00ad tion and the final quarters of study. Ph.D. in Mathematics To be admitted to the doctoral program in Mathematics, an applicant normally must have completed a Master's degree in Mathematics with distinction. Under certain circumstances, where there is evidence of deficiencies in preparation, appli\u00ad cants may be required to provide further evidence of the abil\u00ad ity to succeed in the Ph.D. program, by performing well, for example, in one or more of the specified comprehensive examinations. When accepted into the doctoral program, the student embarks on a program of formal courses, seminars, and indi\u00ad vidual study courses to prepare for the Ph.D. qualifying examination and dissertation. After an appropriate period of advanced study, the Graduate Studies Committee will invite the student to prepare for the qualifying examination (or recommend that the student withdraw from the program). This decision will be reached after consultation with the student's faculty advisor and a review of the instructors' evaluations of the student's per\u00ad formance in courses and seminars. The departmental requirements for advancement to candi\u00ad dacy for the Ph.D. degree are: satisfactory performance in Mathematics 210A-B-C, 220A-B-C, 230A-B-C (which can be taken as part of the Master's program) or the equivalent; satisfactory performance at the post-Master's level in three approved year-long graduate courses (nine one-quarter courses) which must exclude Mathematics 201, 202, 204, 210, 220, 230, 298, 299, or 399; satisfactory performance in two language examinations (French, German, or Russian); and satisfactory performance in the oral qualifying examination. The oral qualifying examination is conducted by a candidacy committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, including at least one member of the faculty outside of the Mathematics Department. After the student meets the requirements, the Graduate Studies Committee recommends to the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research the advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. degree. Teaching experience and training is an integral part of the Ph.D. program. All doctoral students are expected to partici\u00ad pate in the teaching program of the Department. The candidate must demonstrate independent, creative research in mathematics by writing and defending a disserta\u00ad tion that makes a new and valuable contribution to mathe\u00ad matics in the candidate's area of concentration. Following advancement to candidacy, a doctoral committee, appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research on behalf of the Graduate Council, guides and supervises the candidate's research, study, and writing of the dissertation; conducts an oral defense of the dissertation; and recommends that the Ph.D. be conferred upon approval of the doctoral dissertation.

Wallis, Ph.D. Catholic University of America, Professor of Physics (condensed matter theory) Joseph Weber, Ph.D. Catholic University of America, Visiting Profes- sor of Physics (gravitational physics) (visiting, W, S) Physics is that branch of science concerned with the study of natural phenomena at the fundamental level. Physicists study the smallest structure of matter (quarks, nuclei, and atoms); the properties of solids, liquids, gases, and plasmas; the behavior of matter on the grand scale in stars and galaxies; and even the origin and fate of the universe. Other disci\u00ad plines such as chemistry, biology, medicine, and engineering often build upon the foundations laid by physics. In the past century applications of phenomena encountered in the field of physics have led to more changes in our lifestyle than have occurred in the previous millenium. These changes have brought us a \"high\" standard of living on one hand, and a threat of societal extinction on the other. The knowledge gained in physical studies has affected our daily life, our view of life, our philosophies, and our religions. A subject of so great and general an influence is not only of interest to the specialist but should be understood in its scope, power, and promise for the future by every educated person. The Department offers courses for students of various inter\u00ad ests, from those in the liberal arts to those in engineering and other sciences. Faculty members are conducting active research in several forefront areas of physical research, and there is student access to specialized research areas such as elementary particles, plasma physics, astrophysics, and condensed matter at both advanced and undergraduate course levels. The faculty is vigorous, innovative, and engaged in everything from the traditional activities of research, education, and university service to community action, literature, and national policy making, to mention a few examples. The Department encourages student-faculty interaction. The Department consists of people committed to intellectual activities and is exciting to those who are so inclined. Undergraduate Program Courses in the Physics Department are designed to meet the needs of many kinds of students, from those students with\u00ad out facility in mathematics whose main interests lie in the humanities or the arts to those students with professional goals in science and engineering. In addition to the regular UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Physics major, a concentration in Applied Physics and a con\u00ad centration in Biomedical Physics are offered. The three lower-division sequences in physics are distinguished by their intended audience, their mathematical prerequisites, and the extent to which they offer preparation for more advanced courses. These aspects of the beginning courses are summar\u00ad ized in the following table: Physics 3 Intended Audience Premedical students, Biological Sciences majors Prerequisites Physics 5 Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Engineering majors Physics 10-24 Nonscience majors Algebra and trigo- Math 2A (Calculus); None nometry; concurrent Physics I is enrollment in Math 2 recommended. Preparation for Advanced Courses Physics SC with All upper-division None permission courses in physics Requirements for Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: See pages 176-178. Departmental Physics laboratory; Physics 111A-B, 112A\u00ad B, 113A-B, and 115; two quarters of advanced laboratory (Physics 150-153); Mathematics 2A-B-C (or H2A-B-C); Mathematics 3A-B-C; three courses from 110A-B-C, 140A-B-C, 142A-B-C, or 144A-B with Physics llOA-B-C particularly recommended; and three additional coherently related four-unit upper-division courses chosen from the Schools of Physical Sciences, Biological Sciences, Engineering, or the Department of Information and Compu\u00ad ter Science. Students who complete a program in Applied Physics or Biomedical Physics fulfill this requirement with course work taken in satisfaction of concentration requirements. Applied Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Applied Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus s-ix courses in engineering approved by the Physics Department. One quarter of the advanced laboratory requirement may be waived with appropriate engineering laboratory work. Biomedical Physics Requirements The requirements of the concentration in Biomedical Physics include all the requirements of the Physics degree plus the following: Biological Sciences 101, 103, and 104 with asso\u00ad ciated laboratories; Chemistry IA-B-C with laboratory; a three or four quarter sequence of courses in a specific area. Suggested sequences are as follows: 1. Chemistry SlA-B with laboratory; Biological Sciences 106 and 107 2. Biological Sciences 105 plus two Psychobiology courses 3. Chemistry 130A-B-C 4. Radiological Sciences 200A-B plus one additional Radio\u00ad logical Science course Approval must be obtained from the program coordinator. Sequences other than those above may be acceptable. Physics 191 Planning a Program of Study Physics 3 is a one-year course suitable for premedical stu\u00ad dents, students majoring in Biological Sciences, and non\u00ad science majors. It surveys most of the important branches of physics with strong orientation toward modern physics. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Nonscience majors with some mathematical skill may wish to consider Physics 3 as an alternative to Physics 10-24. A student who decides to major in Physics after completing Physics 3 with a grade of A or B may, with the consent of the Department, enroll in Physics SC. The premedical physics requirements may be met with Physics 3 or with Physics SA-B-C. Physics 1 is a preparatory course for the Physics 5 sequence and offers a review of math and problem-solving techniques in the context of introducing physics. Although not required, Physics 1 is highly recommended for all students who lack strong high school preparation in physics and mathematics. Physics 5 is an intensive five-quarter course for students in physics, chemistry, engineering, and other areas who are interested in a careful quantitative approach to the subject. Laboratory work accompanies the course. Students expecting to enroll in the entire five-quarter sequence of Physics 5 should enroll in Mathematics 3A concurrently with Physics SC. Students planning to enroll in only three quarters of Physics 5 need not enroll in Mathematics 3A. Biological Sci\u00ad ences majors with facility in calculus should consider Physics 5 as an alternative to Physics 3. Physics courses numbered between 10 and 24 are general education courses intended for nonscience majors. The con\u00ad tent and format of Physics 21-24 will vary from year to year. In general, these courses will not include regular laboratory work. Courses numbered 110 and above are for Physics majors and other qualified students. This series of courses in the upper\u00ad division curriculum is sufficiently broad to provide programs both for the Physics major who does not intend to pursue the study of physics beyond the Bachelor's degree level and for the Physics major preparing for a professional career in physc ics. Courses numbered between 110 and 116 emphasize the mathematical and theoretical structures that have unified our understanding of nature. Able students may begin the Phys\u00ad ics 111 series in their sophomore year. Courses numbered between 130 and 149 emphasize particular domains of the structure of matter. The Physics major with a career goal, for example, in medicine, law, teaching, or business should emphasize the Physics 130 series, which covers most of the important phenomena of physics. Any major who is so inclined may take more than the minimum two quarters of advanced laboratory work. Laboratory work is assigned to separate courses, numbered ISO to 154.\u00b7 Transfer students are specifically advised to seek individual consultation with a member of the Physics faculty before deciding on a program of courses. Since many graduate physics departments require a reading knowledge of one foreign language, Physics majors planning graduate work should, if possible, study some Russian, Ger\u00ad man, or French. Introductory courses in biology and chemis\u00ad try are also recommended options. Every Physics major should avoid overspecialization and wisely use undergraduate years to explore some areas remote from physics. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 192 Physics Note also that alternatives to Physics major requirements can be approved upon petition to the Department and the Office of the Associate Dean. As a guide to preparing a suitable program, the Department makes the following suggestions: Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate school in engineering should complete the Applied Physics requirements. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in chemistry, biology, or various interdisciplinary areas should contain: Chemistry IA-B-C and 5IA-B-C, and Biological Sciences IOI, I03, and I04. The concentration in Biomedical Physics is offered for Phys\u00ad ics majors who wish to follow an integrated program which combines biology and/or chemistry with physics, and is suit\u00ad able preparation for a graduate career in one of these inter\u00ad disciplinary areas. The course program of Physics majors considering a teaching career in the public schools or the community colleges should contain: Education I73 and I74, and additional preparation in some other area of science or mathematics. Courses from the Phys\u00ad ics I0-24 sequence may be appropriate. The course program of Physics majors considering graduate work in the history of science should contain at least: History 29A-B-C. Courses from the Physics I0-24 sequence may be appropriate. Sample Programs -Physics Sample Programs -Applied Physics Fall Winter Spring Junior. Physics llOA Physics EE113 Elective The Applied Physics concentration within the Physics under\u00ad graduate degree program is designed to provide appropriate education to students who anticipate a career in industrial or technological research. It combines the fundamental knowl\u00ad edge of physical processes obtained from physics courses with the technical knowledge obtained from engineering courses, particularly electrical engineering courses. In addi\u00ad tion to the basic courses in physics, a student is required to complete six courses in the School of Engineering approved by the Physics Department. Examples of appropriate courses include completion of the Applied Physics concentration, the student will receive a B.S. degree in Physics. . A typical course program for Physics majors considering the possibility of graduate study in physics or astronomy is shown below. A student with a strong background may wish to take Physics 113A-B in the junior year.

Engineering EE75 should be completed before the junior year. Program Planning-Biomedical Physics The Biomedical Physics concentration is designed for the stu\u00ad dent who anticipates a career in physics applied to biology and medicine, such as health physics or radiological physics, or who intends to work in a scholarly field which deals with the physical aspects of biology or medicine, such as molecular biology or physiology. Completion of requirements for the Physics major is required as are six quarters of basic courses in biology and chemistry (see table). A sequence of three or f~ur integrated additional courses which must be approved by the program coordinator com\u00ad pletes the program. Students who wish to follow the Biomed\u00ad ical Physics concentration are advised to seek guidance early in their college careers. The requirements are such that coor\u00ad dination of a program in the first and second years is essential. Graduate Program The Department offers the M.S. and the Ph.D. degrees in Physics, the first in recognition of demonstrated knowledge of the basic facts and theories of physics, the second primar\u00ad ily in recognition of demonstrated capacity for independent research. Active programs of research are underway in high energy physics, condensed matter physics, low temperature physics, plasma physics, mathematical physics, gravitational physics, and astrophysics. In general, graduate study in physics is expected to be a full\u00ad time activity. Other proposed arrangements should be approved by the Graduate Committee. Complementing the formal courses, the Department offers regular colloquia and informal seminars. The graduate stu\u00ad dent is a member of an intellectual community and is expected to participate fully in departmental activities. Attendance at colloquia is considered an essential part of graduate study. In addition, there are regular weekly research seminars in condensed matter, high energy, plasma physics, and astrophysics. About 80 graduate students of physics were enrolled in 1986-87. Sources of support available to graduate students include teaching assistantships, research assistantships, and fellow\u00ad ships. Students planning to pursue graduate work in physics should obtain a copy of the Department's graduate brochure. Master of Science in Physics The requirements for the M.S. degree are: (1) at least three quarters of residence; and (2) mastery of graduate course material, which may be demonstrated by passing, with a grade of B or better, a minimum of nine quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 213A-B, 214A, and 215A-B, and a written comprehensive examina\u00ad tion. Under special circumstances, a research project and the\u00ad sis may be accepted in lieu of a written comprehensive exam\u00ad ination. There is no foreign language requirement for the M.S. degree. In addition to the stated course requirements, all students who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying exami\u00ad nation must register continuously for Physics 264A-B-C (Seminar in Conceptual Physics). Physics 193 A typical program in preparation for the written examination for the M.S. degree would consist of 12 courses: 211 (Classical Mechanics) 212A-B (Mathematical Physics) 213A-B (Electromagnetic Theory) 214A-B (Statistical Physics) 215A-B (Quantum Mechanics) Three electives chosen from Physics 212C, 214C, 215C, 216-220, or undergraduate upper-division courses in related areas. Doctor of Philosophy in Physics The principal requirements for the Ph.D. degree are a min\u00ad imum of six quarters of residence, passage of a written and a two-part oral examination, and successful completion and defense of a dissertation reporting results of original research. In addition, the Ph.D. candidate must complete cer\u00ad tain graduate course requirements. There is no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirement for the Ph.D. degree. Course Requirements. The student is required to exhibit mastery of the basic sequences, Mathematical Physics, Classi\u00ad cal Mechanics, Electromagnetic Theory, Quantum Mechanics, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and Statistical Mechanics. A minimum of 15 quarter courses numbered between 200 and 259, including 211, 212A-B, 213A-B, 214A-B, and 215A-B-C, must be passed with a grade of B or better. Students are strongly encouraged to take Physics 211, 212A-B-C, 213A-B, and 215A-B-C in their first year of study. In addition, all stu\u00ad dents who have not passed the Ph.D. qualifying examination are required to register for Physics 264A-B-C. It is expected that students, having selected a research specialty, will ordi\u00ad narily take the core course in that subject (237 A-B-C, 238A\u00ad B-C, or 239A-B-C-D) early in their graduate career. Qualifying Examination. For advancement to Ph.D. candi\u00ad dacy, a student must pass a qualifying examination consisting of a written part and two oral parts. The written part, cover\u00ad ing a broad range of fundamentals of physics at the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels, is normally taken in the fall following the student's first year. The first oral examina\u00ad tion is administered shortly after the written examination. All members of the first oral committee will be from the De\u00ad partment of Physics. A second attempt at this set of examina\u00ad tions will be permitted if the first is not successful. A third at\u00ad tempt will be permitted only in extraordinary circumstances. The second part of the oral examination will be taken approx\u00ad imately one year after successful completion of the written examination and the first oral. The candidacy committee that administers the second oral examination will contain one or two faculty members from outside the Physics Department. The second oral will cover material principally related to the broad and general features of the student's dissertation area. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 194 Physics Teaching Program. Experience in teaching is an integral part of the graduate program, and all graduate students are expected to participate in the teaching program for at least three quarters during their graduate careers. Dissertation. A dissertation summarizing the results of orig\u00ad inal research performed by the student under the supervision of a doctoral committee appointed by the Graduate Council will be required for the Ph.D. degree. A criterion for the acceptability of a dissertation by the Department is that it be suitable for publication in a scientific journal. The disserta\u00ad tion must not have been submitted to any other institution prior to its submission to the Physics Department at UCJ. Defense of Dissertation. Upon completion of the disserta\u00ad tion, the student will take an oral examination, open to the public, before the doctoral committee. Suggested Course Sequence. Typical programs for the first two years designed to prepare the student for Ph.D. qualifi\u00ad cation and provide the foundation necessary for understand\u00ad ing and participating in modern research might include: First Year: 211 (Electromagnetic Theory); 215A-B-C (Quantum Mechanics). In the second and third years of graduate study, the student will take courses providing a background for dissertation research. Areas of concentration may include courses as shown below: For the student with an interest in astrophysics: 214A-B (Statistical Physics); 216 (Particle Physics); (Hydrodynam\u00ad ics); 236A-B-C (Astrophysics); 255 (General Relativity).

Yellott, Jr., Ph.D. Stanford University, Professor of Psychology and Chair of Cognitive Sciences Undergraduate and graduate education in the School of Social Sciences at UCI represents a commitment to modern social science. The classic subject areas of anthropology, eco\u00ad nomics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology are included in the School's educational pro\u00ad grams, but these programs go well beyond the traditional dis\u00ad ciplines and can be characterized by the following three-way emphasis: First, the faculty recognizes the value of systematic empirical observation and quantitative analysis in the study of human behavior. Developments in computer science and in mathe\u00ad matics oriented toward the problems of the social sciences, and the refinement of techniques for the observational, experimental, and statistical study of human behavior, have contributed major new elements to social science. Students in the School of Social Sciences will become familiar with the mathematical, computational, and statistical tools underlying modern social science. Second, many of the most interesting questions in the study of human behavior cannot be fixed within the traditional dis\u00ad ciplinary boundaries. Some of the new and evolving areas which cross orthodox boundaries are political sociology, pub\u00ad lic policy, cognitive anthropology, comparative culture, and psycholinguistics. Therefore many courses and course modules are built around social science phenomena rather than representing social science disciplines. Third, the School shares the academic philosophy that con\u00ad siders the design of hypotheses and of systems of interrelated ideas about the possible structure of the world to be an essential part of scientific pursuit. Consequently, the educa\u00ad tional programs place substantial emphasis ori understanding social science phenomena through the development of theor\u00ad ies that can be used to guide empirical studies. Opportunities for students in the School of Social SCiences to participate in the educational process extend well beyond attendance at courses. Students may develop independent study proposals in cooperation with interested faculty mem\u00ad bers; they are invited to participate in the quarterly evalua\u00ad tion of courses and instructors, to propose new courses and other modifications in existing programs, to nominate candi\u00ad dates for visiting faculty appointments, and to serve on School committees. The School provides a variety of oppor\u00ad tunities for faculty-student interaction, and students will find the faculty, administration, and academic counseling staff of the School highly accessible and responsive. Careers in Social Sciences Graduates of the School of Social Sciences find many and diverse career opportunities. Social Sciences graduates have been in demand for jobs in government, primary and secon\u00ad dary teaching, and human services, as well as for careers in business. Many Social Sciences graduates have gone on to further studies, some at the doctoral level in preparation for careers in research and university teaching, others in the pro\u00ad fessions of law and medicine, in education, and in business administration. Because all Social Sciences degrees involve an educational program that is interdisciplinary and that prepares students to understand quantitative methods of data analysis, gradu\u00ad ates of the School are well-positioned for research and analy\u00ad sis positions in all levels of government and in private firms. Their solid grounding in contemporary social science methods and their familiarity with a broad spectrum of social scientific thinking gives them an excellent foundation for the pursuit of further training in graduate and professional programs. Special Facilities The School of Social Sciences maintains several special facili\u00ad ties for research and education. The Social Sciences Research Laboratory occupies the entire fourth floor of the Social Sci\u00ad ences Laboratory Building. The facility contains 40 ex peri- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988ment and control rooms situated around a central core where two PDP 11-44 computers are available for experimental research. The laboratory is used for both faculty and student research. The Farm School, a small, open, and ungraded elementary school located in a rural setting adjacent to the campus, serves as a research facility for faculty and students having interests in children and how they learn. Each quarter under\u00ad graduates receive course credit for assisting staff teachers, for developing educational materials, and for observing and analyzing child behavior at the school. The Anthropology Laboratory provides research facilities which include computer terminals for statistical studies and for the analysis of texts and other verbal material. The labor\u00ad atory is also available for undergraduate and graduate instruction in field methodology and in analytical techniques through the use of video-cassettes, films, tapes, computer quizzes, and artificial intelligence programs that simulate interviewing situations. Visiting Distinguished Professorships The School of Social Sciences sponsors a program of Visiting Distinguished Professorships designed to provide students with exposure to seminal thinkers in the social sciences. The professorships normally are of a quarter's duration. Partici\u00ad pants have included Martin Bronfenbrenner, Kenan Profes\u00ad sor of Econonomics at Duke University and Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Philip Converse, Robert C. Angell Professor of Political Sciences and Sociology (University of Michigan), President of the American Political Science Association, and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; Beatrice Whiting, Professor of Anthropology and Education Emeritus, Graduate School of Education (Harvard Univer\u00ad sity), and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; John Whiting, Professor of Social Anthropology (Harvard University) and member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; and James Coleman, University Profes\u00ad sor of Sociology (University of Chicago) and member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

Three additional anthropology courses (12 units) selected from those numbered Social Sciences 30-39, 70C, 130-139, or from a list of approved courses. Students are strongly encouraged to take Social Sciences 35A early in their studies and Social Sciences 137 A after they have had at least three courses beyond Social Sciences 2A, 2B, or 2C. Comparative Culture School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Two introductory social science courses (eight units), chosen from Social Sciences 1-8. B. Social Sciences 70A-B-C. C. Social Sciences 170A-B, plus three courses (12 units) selected from one or a combination of the following modules: Social Sciences 170; 171; 172. D. Three courses (12 units) selected from Social Sciences 172. E. Two courses (8 units) designated as Social Sciences 179 (Special Topics) or approved courses. Students are also encouraged to take related courses outside the School of Social Sciences if such courses are appropriate to their educational goals. Economics Students who entered UCI after fall 1983 and prior to fall 1987 should refer to the Catalogue edition in effect the year they entered to determine which major requirements they must satisfy. It is anticipated that the number of students who are quali\u00ad fied to elect Economics as a major will exceed the number of positions available. To ensure that their application is con\u00ad sidered for the fall of 1988, students should be sure to file their application before November 30, 1987. In the event the major in Economics receives more qualified applicants than can be accommodated, applicants may be sub\u00ad ject to screening beyond minimum University of California admissions requirements. Freshman applicants not selected for Economics at the time of admission will be offered an alternate major. However, lower-division courses prerequi\u00ad site to upper-division major study are available to all stu\u00ad dents, and selection to the Economics major at the end of the sophomore year will be based on performance in those courses. Continuing-Student Applicants. Sophomore students who were not admitted to the Economics major upon their admis\u00ad sion to the University may apply for entry into the major as a junior.. Such students should apply for admission during the first five weeks of the spring quarter of their sophomore year in the Undergraduate Counseling Office, SST 122. The fol\u00ad lowing three criteria must be met in order to be considered for admission as a junior: the student must have (a) com\u00ad pleted two quarters of calculus (Mathematics 2A and 2B) with a minimum grade of B, (b) completed the basic economic theory sequence (Social Sciences 12A-B-C) and received a minimum grade of a B in at least two of the three quarters, and (c) must have completed the lower-division writing requirement. Selection criteria also will include affirmative action considerations. Alternative 1' School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 12A-B-C; this course is prerequisite for almost all upper-division economics courses. B. All majors must demonstrate competence in probability and statistics prior to enrolling in any upper-division econom\u00ad ics course, or they must be concurrently enrolled in an approved probability and statistics course. Students may satisfy this requirement by completing Social Sciences llA-B\u00ad C (Le~:ture A), or an equivalent course, or by passing a prob\u00ad ability and statistics examination administ~red by the School. C. All majors must demonstrate competence in calculus by completing Mathematics 2A-B or equivalent courses, or by passing an examination administered by the School of Social Sciences. Students must complete at least Mathematics 2A or an equivalent course prior to enrolling in Social Sciences lilA. D. Social Sciences lllA-B-C. E. Four additional four-unit upper-division economics courses. At least one of the four courses must be research\u00ad oriented and involve the production of a significant research paper. This required paper may be approved by any faculty member in economics. It is strongly recommended that stu\u00ad dents take either the data analysis sequence (Social Sciences IOIA-B-C) or the econometrics sequence (Social Sciences 1010-E-F). Alternative 2 A student who has not completed the economics require\u00ad ments specified above may obtain a B.A. degree in Economics by meeting the School requirements and following a program of study in the area, planned in consultation with a faculty advisor. The program is certified through a petition signed by the Dean and two regular members of the economics faculty. Students who wish to pursue this alternative are strongly advised to consult a faculty advisor well in advance of sub\u00ad mitting a petition. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Honors Program in Economics To graduate in the honors economics program School requirements must be met and must include 19 courses (76 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 12A-B-C. B. Mathematics 2A-B-C must be completed prior to taking Social Sciences HillA. C. Mathematics 3A or an equivalent course. D.

Geography The course of study leading to the B.A. in Geography is not available at this time. Linguistics The undergraduate major in Linguistics is offered by the School of Social Sciences and the School of Humanities. These linguistics programs are administered by the Inter\u00ad School Linguistics Committee. Students are able to select a Linguistics major in either School according to their interests. Both Schools offer a minor in Linguistics. There are two ways to major in Linguistics in the School of Social Sciences. They are designated as Tracks I and II. Track I, Theoretical and Formal Linguistics, will appeal to students interested in areas of cognitive science such as psychology and artificial intelligence. Track I may be taken through either the School of Social Sciences or the School of Humani\u00ad ties (see page 161). Track II, General Linguistics, is for stu\u00ad dents who wish to receive a broad introduction to the major subfields of linguistics. Track II may be taken through either the School of Social Sciences or the School of Humanities. In addition, a third track, Applied Linguistics, is offered solely through the School of Humanities (see page 161). Track 1: Theoretical and Formal Linguistics School requirements must be met and must include 14 courses (56 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 3 B. Social Sciences SOA. C. Six upper-division courses with emphasis 141H, 1411, and Computer Science 162. Track II: General Linguistics A. Social Sciences 3. B. Two upper-division courses in each of the following modules: 1.

One year (three courses) in a single foreign language. Students are strongly urged to study a non-Indo-European language (such as Arabic, Chinese, Hebrew, Japanese, Swa\u00ad hili) whenever available. Residency Requirement for the Linguistics Major: At least six upper-division courses required for the major must be com\u00ad pleted successfully at UCI. Political Science School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses (44 units) as specified below: A. Three introductory courses (12 units) in political science, Social Sciences 6A-B-C. B. Two lower-division courses in political science (eight units). C. Six upper-division courses in political science (24 units). Three of these courses must form a module. Honors Program in Political Science: The honors program in Political Science, open to selected students, provides for advanced work in either of two areas: Theory and Research, or Internship and Research. Admission to the program is based on a formal application normally submitted during the fall quarter of the student's junior year. In order for an appli\u00ad cation to be considered, two conditions must be met. The student must have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2, and the student must have completed at least five politi\u00ad cal science courses (with a grade point average of 3.5 or higher) by the end of fall quarter of the junior year. Success\u00ad ful completion of the honors program requires attendance at the Honors Seminar and completion of an honors thesis. Psychology School requirements must be met and must include 15 courses (60 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 7 B. Two introductory courses (eight units) in the social sci\u00ad ences chosen from Social Sciences 2A or 2B, 3, 4, SA C. A one-quarter course in experimental psychology with a laboratory section. (For 1987-88, this requirement may be satisfied by taking Social Sciences ISlA and 151LA.) D. Three upper-division psychology courses (12 units) chosen from the following core courses in psychology: Social Sciences 151U, 152D, 153G, 154A, 155B, 156A. E. Eight additional courses (four or more units each) with emphasis in psychology, distributed as follows: 1. No more than three of the eight may be lower-division. 2. Three of the upper-division courses used to satisfy requirements D and E must be taken from one of the fol\u00ad lowing modules: Social Sciences :1,41, 142, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156. 3. Certain courses offered in the School of Biological Sci\u00ad ences and the Program in Social Ecology may be used in partial satisfaction of this requirement. Such courses must be chosen from the approved list of psychology-related courses in these disciplines. NOTE: Psychology majors are strongly encouraged to take Biological Sciences 79-80-81 in partial satisfaction of the natural sciences portion of the breadth requirement (Cate\u00ad gory II). Furthermore, it is strongly recommended that stu\u00ad dents who intend postbaccalaureate work in psychology take the sequence Social Sciences 151A-B-C and Social Sciences 152F. Some psychology graduate programs require calculus (which, at UCI, may be satisfied by taking Mathematics 2A-B-C). UC IRVINE - 1987-1988204 Social Sciences Honors Program in Psychology: The honors program in Psy\u00ad chology is open to selected juniors majoring in Psychology. It provides the opportunity for basic research in some area of psychology under faculty supervision. The program has a limited number of openings and seeks to attract outstanding students who plan to undertake postgraduate education in some field of the psychological sciences. Admission to the program is based on a formal application to the Psychology Honors Committee, normaHy submitted in the spring quarter of the sophomore year or the fall quarter of the junior year. Applicants should have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in psychol\u00ad ogy courses, although this requirement may be waived in unusual cases. Participants are expected to have taken or to take Biological Sciences 80 and 81 (or suitable substitutes), Social Sciences 151A-B-C, and Social Sciences 152F, and to enroll in the Honors Seminar in Psychology (H150A-B-C) each quarter. Participants also are expected to have com\u00ad pleted or to complete course work beyond the level of the breadth requirement in one or more of the following areas: biological sciences, mathematics, computer science, physical science, linguistics, philosophy. Three of the six Honors Seminar courses may be used to satisfy Part E of the Psy\u00ad chology major requirements. To graduate in the honors pro\u00ad gram, a student must successfully complete requirements for the B.A. degree in Psychology with an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a grade point average of at least 3.5 in psychology courses. In addition, each student must successfully complete a senior honors thesis, as part of the Honors Seminar course work. Social Science Requirements for the B.A. degree in Social Science are met by completing the School requirements on page 193. Sociology School requirements must be met and must include 11 courses (44 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 8A, 8B, and 8C. B. One introductory course (four units) in Social Sciences, taken from Social Sciences 1-7. C. Five of the following core courses in sociology (20 units). No more than two may be lower-division, and at least one must be taken from each set: (1) Social Sciences 61D, upper-division sociology courses, or approved substitutes (eight units). Double Majors In order to double major within the School of Social Sciences, the following conditions must be met: (1) Normally, neither major program may be the general social science program. (2) Major and School requirements must be met for both majors with no overlap of courses except for those used to satisfy the mathematics, computer science, and introductory social science requirements. The mathematics and computer science courses need only be taken once. Only two introduc\u00ad tory social science classes are needed, provided this also. meets the requirements of both major programs. The same two-digit and upper-division courses may not be used to meet the requirements of more than one major program. For example, a student who wishes to major in psychology and anthropology may take one of the mathematics sequences, Information and Computer Science 1, and may use Introduc\u00ad tion to Psychology and Introduction to Anthropology to meet the major and School requirements for both programs. How\u00ad ever, two different sets of two-digit and upper-division courses must be taken to complete the major and School requirements of the two programs. Anthropology Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Anthropology are met by tak\u00ad ing seven anthropology courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 2A. B. Social Sciences 2B or 2C. C. Two courses (eight units), one from each of two of the following topical areas in anthropology: (1) Social Sciences 131 A, 131B. (2) Social Sciences 131N, 1312. (3) Social Sciences 131E, 131}. (4) Social Sciences 131R, 131S, 131X. D. One course (four units) on a geographical area, selected from those numbered Social Sciences 134. E. Two additional anthropology courses (eight units), selected from those numbered Social Sciences 30-39, 70C, 130-139, or from a list of approved courses. F. In addition, students must either satisfy the School mathematics and computer science requirement (School requirement A), or take three courses (12 units) or equivalent in a single acceptable foreign language. Comparative Culture Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Comparative Culture are met by taking seven courses (28 units) as specified below: A. One course chosen from the Social Sciences 70A-B-C series. B. Six courses chosen from Social Sciences 170, 171, 172, 179 (no more than two from the 179 series). C. While students will be responsible for designing the minor according to the above guidelines, the curriculum for the minor should be planned in consultation with Comparative Culture faculty. Curricula must receive prior approval from one faculty member in the program as well as the Chair of Comparative Culture. Linguistics Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Linguistics are met by taking seven linguistics courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 3, 141A, and 141H. B. Four additional upper-division linguistics courses selected from the Social Sciences 141, 142, 143, and/or 144 series. Students are encouraged to refer to the program require\u00ad ments for the tracks of the Linguistics major and to consult with the faculty before making their selection. Residency Requirement: At least four upper-division courses required for the minor must be completed successfully at UCI. Political Science Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Political Science are met by taking seven political science courses (28 units) as specified below: A. One course from the Social Sciences 6A-B-C series. B. Three upper-division political science courses, chosen from one of the Social Science modules numbered 120-128. C. Three additional courses in political science, chosen from those numbered Social Sciences 6, 20-29, or 120-129. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Psychology Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Psychology are met by taking seven psychology courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 7. B. Three upper-division psychology courses chosen from the following core courses in psychology: Social Sciences 151U, 152D, 153G, 154A, 155B, 156A. C. Three additional psychology courses (four or more units each) chosen from Social Sciences 50-59, 142, 151-159. D. In addition, the School mathematics and computer science requirement (School requirement A) must be satisfied. Sociology Minor Requirements Requirements for the minor in Sociology are met by taking seven sociology courses (28 units) as specified below: A. Social Sciences 8A-B-C. B. Three of the following core courses in Sociology (12 units). No more than one may be lower-division and at least one must be taken from each set: (1) Social Sciences 61D, upper-division Sociology course (four units) chosen from those numbered Social Sciences 161 or 162. D. In addition, students must either satisfy the School mathematics and computer science requirement (School requirement A), or take three courses (12 units) or equivalent in a single acceptable foreign language. Transfer Students Freshmen and Sophomores: Students transferring to UCI as freshmen or sophomores will fulfill the regular requirements of the four-year program either through work at UCI or t~rough transfer credit for comparable work elsewhere. Juniors: Junior transfers electing to major in one of the School's degree programs and with good records at other accredited colleges and universities normally will be pre\u00ad sumed to have satisfied School requirement Band the Uni\u00ad versity requirements, with the exception of the upper\u00ad division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I). Students anticipating transfer to UCI in their junior year, however, should plan their programs so as to anticipate the special mathematics requirements of the pro\u00ad gram (School requirement A). Every effort will be made to accommodate individual variation in background, provided students are prepared to commit themselves to intensive work in areas of deficiency. Ordinarily, the typical two-year program for junior transfers is simply the last two years of the regular four-year program, except that students who have not satisfied the mathematics requirements of the School should plan to do so in the junior year and must do so before graduation. Seniors: Students wishing to graduate with a degree in the School by transferring to UCI in their senior year should plan their work carefully to ensure that the requirements can be met in one year of residence. In general, differences between the program at UCI and programs elsewhere make senior transfers difficult. 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course Social Sciences 205 requirements (including breadth requirements) for their bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply to the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in Business Administration (M.B.A.) along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Completion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Program. Upon admis\u00ad sion, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Program, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact their academic counselor.

Though the Concentration as such can be elected by any student in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology, the courses of the Concentration are open to all UCI students. Participants in the Concentration m~:~st complete the equival\u00ad ent of nine courses, beginning in the sophomore year with an introductory series and culminating with the Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum and its related Seminar, usually taken during the senior year. The student selects the remainder of the courses comprising the Concentration from an approved list of upper-division courses and must organize these choices in consultation with a panel of the participating faculty into a coherent interdisciplinary program complementary to the student's major. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 206 Social Sciences Requirements for the Concentration: Three lower-division courses: History 11 (introduction to Peace and Conflict), Social Science 26D (The Nuclear Arms Race), Physics 16 (Physics of Nuclear Weapons) Five relevant upper-division courses. Among those usually offered are: History 146B (U.S. Foreign Relations Since World War II), Social Sciences 123G (U.S. Foreign Policy), Social Sci\u00ad ences 123D (U.S. National Security), Social Sciences 113E (Political Economy of National Defense), Social Sciences 122A-B (Soviet Society and Politics), History 133A-B-C (European International History: 1870-1986), History 195 (Arms Control Simulation), Philosophy 182 (Issues in Social Philosophy), Humanities 198, Social Ecology 178, 179, 180 (Social Ecology of Peace), Social Sciences 161Z (War, Peace, and Gender). With approval of the Global Peace and Conflict Studies faculty, relevant lower-division courses may be substituted for up to two of the five upper-division courses. A minimum of two quarters of Humanities 180 (same as Social Sciences 123S or Social Ecology E184)-Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum-total of two units maximum for credit. One quarter of Humanities 181 (same as Social Sciences 123T or Social Ecology E185)-Peace and Conflict Seminar\u00ad totaling two units, taken during winter quarter of the senior year. Further information concerning the Concentration in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is available from selected faculty representatives in 535 Social Science Tower, 300A Humani\u00ad ties Office Building, or 356 Social Ecology Building. Concentration in Religious Studies The undergraduate Concentration in Religious Studies encourages the student to examine religion and religious phenomena in the context of the several disciplines repre\u00ad sented in the Schools of Humanities, Fine Arts, and Social Sciences. The Concentration, which is available with any major offered by these three Schools, is, for the most part, made up of courses already offered in the undergraduate cur\u00ad riculum; it allows the student to organize these courses, however, into a program complementary to the student's major. It is the objective of the Concentration that participat\u00ad ing students expand their appreciation and understanding of religion in the context of their own major discipline while also developing critical abilities in the area of religious studies in its own right. While the Concentration takes as its subject all religion and religious phenomena and courses are offered in non-Western religious subjects, the academic specialties of the majority of the contributing faculty lie in Western traditions. Students electing the Concentration are required to take eight one-quarter courses from those approved for the Con\u00ad centration. The courses are gathered into three generic cate\u00ad gories: religious theory and comparative religions, canonical literature, and topics in religious studies. Students take two courses from each category as well as two additional courses from among those approved for the Concentration. For further information and a quarterly list of courses available, please contact the Coordinator of the Concentration, 343 Humanities Office Building. Planning a Program of Study Since there are many alternative ways to plan a program, some of which may require careful attention to specific major requirements, students should consult with their assigned faculty advisors or visit the Undergraduate Advising Office (122 Social Science Tower) to design an appropriate program of study. \u00b7 Students who elect one of the Social Sciences majors in their freshman year might begin by taking the one-digit courses required by their major and one of the mathematics se\u00ad quences listed under Part A of the School requirements. It is a good idea to take these courses early since they include fundamental concepts that will be widely applicable in more advanced courses. In addition, the lower-division writing requirement of the breadth requirement (Category I) should be completed during the first year. In the sophomore year, the student might complete the course on computing, three courses toward the breadth requirement, four courses in the social sciences, and four electives. Students who are planning to go on to graduate school can use their freshman and sophomore years to advantage by taking courses in theory, research methods, mathematics, and other areas important to graduate study. In the junior and senior years, the student should take courses in the major area and should create an individualized program of study through a combination of courses and course modules which fall in an area of interest. Particular attention should be paid to planning a program of study that will ensure that major requirements are met prior to graduation. Teaching Credentials Students planning to seek State of California teaching cre\u00ad dentials in social science should discuss their undergraduate curriculum plans with the School's academic counselors. Stu\u00ad dents completing any of the B.A. programs in the School qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Exami\u00ad nation in social science. For additional information about teaching credentials, see the Teacher Education section. Mathematics and Social Science The mathematics requirement stems from the nature of modern social science. The concepts and terms of mathemat\u00ad ics, statistics, and computers are an important part of the social scientist's vocabulary. Basic knowledge of these tools is necessary to an understanding of current literature in the social sciences, to the analysis of data, and to an intelligent use of social science models. Each candidate for a degree in the School of Social Sciences is expected to have a basic knowledge of probability, statistics, and computing. In addi\u00ad tion, for students who are preparing for graduate school in an area of social science, it will be important to supplement the minimal mathematics requirements with additional courses related to mathematics and social science methodol\u00ad ogy. The particular courses which would be recommended are not specified here, however, since they are highly dependent on the major emphasis of the student. Students who are preparing for graduate study should consult their advisors to determine a program of study which will give them the research skills necessary for successful graduate work. Graduate Programs Graduate education within the School of Social Sciences is administered by faculty groups in Cognitive Sciences, Com\u00ad parative Culture, Economics, Mathematical Social Science, Politics and Society, and Social Relations (including graduate anthropology). Doctoral students may be admitted to one of six established concentrations: Cognitive Sciences, leading to the Ph.D. in Psychology; Comparative Culture, leading to the Ph.D. in Comparative Culture; Economics, leading to the Ph.D. in Economics; Social Networks, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science; Politics and Society, leading to the Ph.D. in UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Political Science; and Social Relations, leading to the Ph.D. in Social Science. When the interests of the student lie outside of or across the areas encompassed by the recognized gradu\u00ad ate programs, the Associate Dean of Graduate Studies, School of Social Sciences, may, on rare occasions, appoint a faculty committee of at least three members to guide an independent course of study leading to the Ph.D. degree in Social Science. Although the School does not offer other programs leading to a Master of Arts degree, the M.A. degree in Comparative Culture, Economics, or Social Sciences may be conferred upon doctoral students who satisfy the requirements of the Office of Research and Graduate Studies. Admissions Potential graduate students should apply to the Division of Graduate Studies and Research for admission to the graduate program of the School of Social Sciences, indicating the title of the degree which they intend to pursue (Ph.D. in Compar\u00ad ative Culture, Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science), and the academic area in which they expect to concentrate. In addition to the University admission require\u00ad ments, each groupmay prescribe special requirements or expectations of applicants. All applicants are required to submit scores for the Graduate Record \"Examination General Test. Letters of recommendation\u00b7 are an important factor in the admission decision. Financial Support Limited financial support in the form of teaching assistant\u00ad ships and fellowships is available to qualified students. There may be research assistantships available under grants to indi\u00ad vidual faculty. Students are expected to seek such aid for which they are eligible from sources external to the University. General Requirements for the Ph.D. Degree in Economics, Political Science, Psychology, or Social Science The general requirements for the Ph.D. in Economics, Politi\u00ad cal Science, Psychology, or Social Science (in addition to those which apply to all UCI graduate students) are summarized below. Each recognized group within the School of Social Sci\u00ad ences may describe \u00b7additional requirements, subject to the approval of the Graduate Council. Length of Study The faculty envisages a student's Ph.D. program to be of approximately four to five years' duration. Residence Because the intellectual training the School proposes requires full-time study and constant contact with the faculty, the School does not accept part-time students. Language A knowledge of one foreign language, appropriate to the stu\u00ad dent's research concerns, is required. Each student's group or candidacy committee will prescribe specific requirements. For those proposing to engage in field research, this may involve interviewing capabilities. Quantitative Methods Candidates for the Ph.D. degrees in Economics, Social Science, Political Science, or Psychology must satisfy a quan\u00ad titative methods requirement. This may be met by (1) satis\u00ad faction of the quantitative methods requirement of the stu\u00ad dent's graduate program, or (2) completion of two years of college-level mathematics, statistics, logic, or applications of statistics to social science research problems, in courses Social Sciences 207 A malhemalimlthe~ry of perception is the research interest of Professors Chelan Prakash, Department of Mathematics, Donald Hoffman, School of Social Sciences, ar1d Bruce Ben nell, Department of Mathematics (/efi to righl}. approved by the faculty in charge of the student's graduate program. In the latter option, courses may include one com\u00ad puter science course; ordinarily at least one year of these quantitative methods courses will b~ taken during the stu\u00ad dent's graduate career. Examinations The scope and format of the qualifying examinations will be determined by the student's candidacy committee. These examinations may be written or oral, or both, and usually will be conducted after approximately two years of residence. Also, a student may be required to take additional examina\u00ad tions, submit research papers, or conduct experiments which the committee deems appropriate to the student's interests and goals. Upon satisfactory completion of the qualifying examinations, and approval of the dissertation topic, the can\u00ad didacy committee will recommend that the student be advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D: degree. Dissertation Following advancement to candidacy, the dissertation is supervised by a doctoral committee ordinarily consisting of three members of the candidacy committee. The purpose of the dissertation is to demonstrate the student's ability to orig\u00ad inate significant research problems, to investigate such prob\u00ad lems both broadly and deeply, a\u00b7nd to write scholarly material of publishable quality.

White: Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints Joseph L. White: Black Psychology, Community Mental Health, Child Development, and Psychotherapy The doctoral program in Comparative Culture emphasizes the interdisciplinary study of ethnocultural groups in the United States-dominant American, Afro-American, Asian\u00ad American, and Native American-including their interrela\u00ad tionships and antecedents. The program is designed to train research scholars in American and ethnic studies. It allows students to focus on one of two major approaches to cultural analysis. Students may choose to emphasize such expressive forms of culture as literature, religion, myth, and the arts in relation to history and society. Or they may choose to con\u00ad centrate on social inquiry, including social theory and the perspectives provided by such social sciences as anthropology, economics, psychology, social history, and sociology. Thus, graduate students are prepared for academic positions in interdisciplinary programs as well as in departments of Eng\u00ad lish, history, and various social sciences. Admission The program in Comparative Culture admits new graduate students in the fall. Requirements and standards for admis\u00ad sion into the program are in keeping with those of the Uni\u00ad versity of California as a whole. Students with a B.A. degree will be considered for admission on the basis of past academic performance and current academic interests. In addition to the general application material, the program requires test results from the verbal and quantitative sections of the Graduate Record Examination. Minorities and women are particularly encouraged to apply. Applicants for fellowship or assistantship awards must apply by January 1. Application for assistance based upon financial need (grants, loans, or work-study awards) is made through the UCI Financial Aid Office. Applications for admission received after March 1, but no later than July 1, will be con\u00ad sidered for the fall quarter only if space is available-other\u00ad wise they will be deferred until a later quarter. Residence The University residence requirement for the Ph.D. is a min\u00ad imum of six quarters. Required and Elective Courses The program requires 18 courses (72 units for the doctorate). Courses are selected in consultation with the program's graduate advisor so as to prepare the student for the first\u00ad year screening examination, the Ph.D. qualifying examina\u00ad tion, and the development of a dissertation topic. The following courses are required of students during their first and second years of graduate study: Social Sciences 270A (Proseminar in Expressive Forms), 273A (Proseminar in Social Inquiry), 275A-B-C (Methods of Social Inquiry), 276A-B-C (Seminar in Expressive Forms of Cul\u00ad ture), 271A-B-C (Colloquium on Dominant American Cul\u00ad Afro-American Culture), 274C-D (Colloquium and 274G-H (Colloquium on Native-American Cultures). Addi\u00ad tionally, students take two four-unit elective courses upon advisement during their first and second years of graduate study. During the third year, students normally take elective courses and/or directed reading courses upon advisement in preparation for the Ph.D. qualifying examinations. All graduate students, including Teaching Assistants and Associates, are expected to enroll for a minimum of 12 units of academic credit (ordinarily, three courses) each quarter. Any student who wishes to take more than four courses (16 units) must petition the Graduate Committee and gain the approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies. Incomplete grades will not be assigned for year-long courses except under extenuating circumstances. Credit for Previous Academic Work Students entering with an M.A. degree may request credit for a maximum of nine courses. These courses normally are to be used in lieu of electives. A written petition requesting acceptance of previous work in lieu of electives must be made to the Graduate Advisor. Approval of the Dean of Graduate Studies also is required. Language Requirements Two foreign languages or one foreign language and statistics are required. The language will be determined by the student in consultation with the Graduate Advisor. The language requirement must be satisfied either through a standard Edu\u00ad cational Testing Service examination or by another method approved by the Graduate Advisor. The statistics require\u00ad ment can be satisfied by taking two quarters of course work in social science statistics chosen in consultation with the Graduate Advisor. The language and/or the statistics require\u00ad ments must be satisfied before the Ph.D. qualifying examina\u00ad tion can be taken. Comprehensive First-Year Examination Two weeks after final examinations in the spring quarter, first-year students are administered a comprehensive exami\u00ad nation based upon materials from their course work. The examination is administered by the program's graduate ad\u00ad visor. Normally the examination consists of four sections, corresponding to the required courses offered that year. Stu\u00ad dents are notified of the results within 10 working days of the examination. A student must pass all sections of the comprehensive exam\u00ad ination in order to continue graduate study. A student who fails the examination has the option of retaking those failed sections once prior to the beginning of the fall quarte.r. The results of the second examination will be final. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988The Ph.D. Qualifying Examination The Ph.D. qualifying examination must be taken by the end of the third year, after the completion of 84 units of course work, the language examination, and/or the language and statistics requirement. Doctoral students are administered two examinations, one written and one oral, which are based upon the written examination. The student's Ph.D. advisory committee is comprised of four members of the Irvine Division of the Academic Senate or of persons with equivalent qualifications, and is formed by the Graduate Advisor in consultation with the student and Com\u00ad parative Culture faculty. The chair of the advisory committee and at least two other members of the examining committee must be Comparative Culture faculty. The committee admin\u00ad isters the subsequent oral examination and guides the stu\u00ad dent's dissertation project. The committee is responsible for formulating the examination questions, though the entire Comparative Culture faculty may submit questions for the examination. The written examination is based upon program courses and electives taken by the student in satisfaction of graduate course work. The written examination consists of four parts: nondominant cultures and classes, dominant American cul\u00ad ture, cultural theory and method, and an area of specializa\u00ad tion, perhaps including but not limited to the student's dis\u00ad sertation project. The fourth area is formulated by the stu\u00ad dent in close consultation with the examining committee. The written examination is administered over two days, each section requiring three hours of writing. Students who fail the written examination may petition to take the failed portions a second time. Two failures culminate in expulsion from the program. Upon successful completion of the written examination, the student may advance to the oral examination, which is given no more than two weeks later. The oral examination is con\u00ad ducted by a candidacy committee appointed in the name of the Graduate Council. This committee normally consists of the four members of the written examination committee, plus a fifth member who does not hold a faculty appointment in Comparative Culture. This committee recommends ad\u00ad vancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. if the examination is \u00b7 successful. ' The Dissertation The student must present a written statement of a disserta\u00ad tion project to the dissertation committee,- which must approve the proposal. This statement must be presented within a year of successf~.Il completion of the qualifying examinations. The dissertation itself normally should be suc\u00ad cessfully completed within three years after the qualifying examinations. The dissertation committee is appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies on behalf of the Graduate Council upon the recommendation of the program graduate advisor after consultation with the student. Master of Arts in Comparative Culture Those doctoral students who pass the first-year comprehen\u00ad sive examination but do not continue beyond that point, or those who have passed the Ph.D. Qualifying Examination, may be awarded the Master of Arts degree by (a) completing 36 units (nine courses), 24 units (six courses) of which must be in Comparative Culture and 12 units (three courses) of which are approved electives in Comparative Culture or a related area; and (b) demonstrating proficiency in a language or an alternate skill. Social Sciences 209 Additional Information Normal Progress. Normal progress is defined as earning B grades or better in all required courses, maintaining a B aver\u00ad age in all course work, satisfactory performance on a first\u00ad year screening examination, satisfactory performance on the Ph.D. qualifying examination taken by the end of the third year, and satisfactory completion of the doctoral dissertation by the end of the sixth year. A grade of incomplete in any course must be replaced by a satisfactory grade within three quarters of its incurrence. Grades of incomplete will not be given for three-quarter or two-quarter course sequences except under extenuating circumstances. In Progress grades can be awarded for the first term of a two-quarter course and for the first and second. terms of a three-quarter course. To be eligible for a teaching assistantship a student can have no more than one incomplete within the last three quarters and must carry a minimum of twelve units per quarter with satisfactory grades for the last three quarters. All incompletes must be resolved before the Ph.D. qualifying examination can be taken. Leaves of Absence.A Student must formally petition the Graduate Advisor for a leave of absence from graduate study. Such leaves normally will be granted for medical or financial reasons. Students are entitled to no more than three quarters of leave during their tenure in the graduate program. Doctor of Philosophy in Economics Participating Faculty Duran Bell: Formal Models, Economic Anthropology David Brownstone: Econometrics and Industrial Organization Michael L. Burton: Cognitive Anthropology, Economic Anthropol- ogy, Cultural\" Ecology, Gender Frank Cancian: Anthropology, Social Stratification, Economic Anthropology, Agriculture, Mexico ArthurS.

Lilien: Macroeconomics, Labor Economics and Applied Econometrics Julius Margolis: Economic Analysis of Government Behavior: Posi\u00ad tive and Normative Giovanna Mossetti: Macroeconomics and Monetary Theory Kenneth Small: Urban Economics, Econometrics, Transportation Economics \u00b7 Carole Uhlaner: Comparative Political Participation, Formal Models of Political Behavior The Ph.D. program in Economics is administered by the Eco\u00ad nomics and Public Policy faculty who, drawing upon the School's strong quantitative tradition, specialize in economet\u00ad ric techniques applied to government behavior, labor econom\u00ad ics, transportation economics, and urban economics. Admis\u00ad sion to the Ph.D. program in Economics is highly selective and is limited to students whose interests mesh closely with those of the faculty. By requiring a high degree of overlap UC IRVINE - 1987-1988210 Social Sciences between faculty and student research interests, the program offers extensive faculty contact within a tutorial framework. Motivated and well-qualified students find the UCI graduate program in economics highly attractive because of its small size and its great flexibility. Self-discipline and an inquiring mind are prerequisites. Requirements All students must show competence in microeconomic the\u00ad ory, macroeconomics, and econometrics. Normally this is done by taking a three-course sequence in each of these areas. Students also must master two fields of applied eco\u00ad nomics by taking a two-course sequence (possibly including independent reading courses) and writing a research paper in each. Students also must enroll for at least four quarters in the graduate colloquium, in which attendance at regular Eco\u00ad nomics faculty research colloquia is supplemented by discus\u00ad sion of the papers presented and additional reading. Students are encouraged to become conversant with areas of current economic research early on in their graduate careers, in order to facilitate a timely transition from meeting course and field requirements to thinking through a dissertation research plan. After meeting the above requirements, the student will be advanced to candidacy upon completion of an oral exami\u00ad nation on a written dissertation proposal. Concentration in Transportation Economics Students can also be awarded a Ph.D. in Economics with a concentration in Transportation Economics. This option draws upon the unusual collection of transportation research\u00ad ers on the campus, both within the School of Social Sciences, the School of Engineering, the Graduate School of Manage\u00ad ment, and the Program in Social Ecology. Students benefit from association with the Institute of Transportation Studies, a systemwide research unit headquartered at UCI. It facili\u00ad tates student research by providing research assistantships and interdisciplinary seminars on all modes of transportation. Requirements for the concentration are the same as those described above with the following three exceptions: (1) stu\u00ad dents must substitute any two of tne following four courses for the third quarter of microeconomic and macroeconomic theory: Discrete Choice Econometrics (Social Sciences 213G), Advanced Travel Demand Analysis (Engineering CE220A), Operations Research for Management (Management 2018), Microeconomic Theory III (?ocial Sciences 212C); (2) one of the student's two required fields of competence must be transportation economics (typically including Social Sciences 214G-H), and the other must be a cognate field such as urban economics, labor economics, industrial organization, or a transportation-related field from outside economics such as travel demand and flow theory, urban and transportation pol\u00ad icy analysis, environmental impacts of transportation, or urban and transportation planning (subject to the approval of the Director of Graduate Studies for Economics); and (3) stu\u00ad dents must take at least one additional course from a list of designated courses in transportation and related subject areas. The courses may be selected from the wide range of courses offered through the schools and programs participat\u00ad ing in the concentration. Research facilities UCI is a major research university and has an excellent library with a collection of more than one million volumes, as well as special interlibrary loan arrangements with other UC libraries. The School of Social Sciences provides a computer room, conference rooms, and offices for graduate students. Students have access to several campus computers, in addi\u00ad tion to smaller facilities within the School. Two organized research units, the Institute of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization, provide research opportunities and financial support for several graduate stu\u00ad dents with interests in those fields. Students may also partic\u00ad ipate in many individual faculty research projects. Admission The deadline for application for admission is February I for fall quarter. Students are admitted for winter or spring quar\u00ad ters only under exceptional circumstances. Late applications are considered on a space-available basis. All applicants must take the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) prior to the applica\u00ad tion deadline. Verbal, quantitative, and the Economics Subject Test scores are required.

Members are committed to studies involving the application of social science theory to the analysis of political and social behavior and structures and to the solution of social issues. The Ph.D. is granted in Political Science. Special emphasis is placed on recruiting students who pro\u00ad pose to pursue research in the following areas: (a) authority, power, and value allocations relating to public policy, to organization, to participation, and to relationships within and between social and political units; (b) change and structure of cultures and of social and political units; and (c) empirical the\u00ad ory, mathematical models, and quantitative analysis of politi\u00ad cal phenomena. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Faculty are currently conducting research on authority rela\u00ad tions, organizational theory, and bureaucratic political behavior; mass media and society; democracy and participation; public policy; political thought; quantitative political science; foreign policy and international relations; and comparative politics with an emphasis on Europe and Latin America. Two organized research units are affiliated with the group: the Institute of Transportation Studies and the Public Policy Research Organization. Both sponsor theoretical and applied research on social issues. The Focused Research Program in Authority Studies also offers research opportunities for graduate students in political science. Admissions Students are normally expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test which total over 1,100. Decisions on admission are strongly influenced by let\u00ad ters of recommendation and the statement of student interest. Requirements The following are in addition to the general School and cam\u00ad pus requirements. Each year a core program, focusing on major substantive areas as well as research methods, will be outlined for entering graduate students. Those who have not already taken college mathematics are required to take at least three quarters of approved mathematics or statistics courses. At the completion of the first year, the performance of each student is reviewed and the faculty will indicate whether the student should continue. Attendance in a collo\u00ad quium series also is required for all graduate students during their first two years in residence. Reviews and Examinations Students ordinarily are expected to maintain a grade point average of 3.5 or better. At the completion of the first year a review of performance in the core program will be conducted for each student by the Politics and Society faculty. At that time, an advisory committee of three faculty will be identified to supervise the examinations leading to advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. By June I of each year, the approval of the advisory committee must be obtained for the student to be eligible for financial support during the subsequent aca\u00ad demic year. A set of written examinations, normally taken at the end of the second year of study, tests competency in a set of major domains of intellectual inquiry determined by the student and the advisory committee. Upon successful completion of these comprehensive examinations and demonstration of competence in mathematics and a foreign language, a formal candidacy committee is appointed to oversee the final qualify\u00ad ing examination and formal advancement to candidacy. Stu\u00ad dents are expected to advance to candidacy by the ninth quarter of graduate study. After the student advances to candidacy, the doctoral com\u00ad mittee, usually composed of three members of the candidacy committee, supervises work toward completion of the dissertation.

Watt: Cognitive Semiotics Language Acquisition, Psycholinguistics, Linguistics John I. Yellott, Jr.: Mathematical Psychology and Visual Perception The Ph.D. program in Psychology is administered by the Cognitive Sciences faculty who share common interests in human cognition and who are concerned with how the mind works. It conducts research and provides advanced graduate training in cognitive psychology and theoretical linguistics. The group lays special stress on precise scientific approaches to issues in human cognition. It views the formation of for\u00ad mal models as instrumental in understanding the nature of the human mind. The group takes as its intellectual domain the following: mathematical psychology, perception (visual and auditory), cognitive development, problem solving, artificial intelligence, learning, memory, psycholinguistics, semiotics, and theoreti\u00ad cal linguistics. It does not emphasize traditional training in psychology or linguistics per se; rather, it stresses the inte\u00ad gration of research in the areas mentioned above, and in related areas, into a discipline whose central focus is the study of human knowledge and human information process\u00ad ing, regardless of the medium in which it is expressed. Admissions In addition to meeting the general requirements for admis\u00ad sion, applicants should have acquired a background in mathematics equivalent to at least one year of calculus. Advanced courses in some of the following fields are con\u00ad sidered highly desirable: computer science, mathematics and the physical sciences, biology, logic, and linguistics. Each admission application will be considered on its own merits. Requirements Each student is expected to take two three-course graduate sequences. The first is a three-quarter methods sequence covering the areas of probability and statistics, experimental design, and mathematical models of language (Social Sciences 241 A-B-C). The other is a proseminar sequence covering areas such as learning, memory, perception, and linguistics (Social Sciences 242A-B-C). Suitable substitutes may be made with written approval of the group. Additional advanced course work in other fields relevant to the student's interests will supplement the required courses. Students are expected to enroll in the Cognitive Sciences Research Seminar (Social Sciences 240A-B-C) during all quarters in residence prior to advancement to candidacy. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 212 Social Sciences Each student is expected to carry out theoretical/empirical research during the first two years. By the end of the second year, each student should have completed a research project of a scope and nature that is potentially publishable in a rele\u00ad vant journal. The student's advisor is responsible for assisting in the planning and other facets of the project. Students are expected to write a paper based on their research and to pre\u00ad sent a talk to the \"Cognitive Sciences Seminar\" or another appropriate forum by the end of the spring quarter of their second full year in the graduate program. Reviews At the end of each academic year the faculty in the group will meet to discuss the progress of each of its students and to provide feedback on the progress and perceived deficiencies of each student. The advancement-to-candidacy examination will consist of an oral examination and, at the faculty's option, a written exam\u00ad ination as well. Normally this step will be completed by the end of the third or beginning of the fourth year of the pro\u00ad gram. The examination will be based on the student's disser\u00ad tation proposal. A student who fails the examination twice will be asked to withdraw. Prior to submission of the final version of the dissertation the student will be expected to defend the dissertation in a public colloquium. Doctor of Philosophy in Social Science The Ph.D. program in Social Science comprises two concen\u00ad trations, one in Social Networks and the other in Social Rela\u00ad tions, that are administered by the Mathematical Social Sci\u00ad ence faculty and the Social Relations faculty, respectively. The areas of interest of each group cover sociology, anthro\u00ad pology, social psychology, political science, and human geog\u00ad raphy, but each group's approach to these topics differs markedly. Concentration in Social Networks Participating Faculty William Batchelder: Mathematical Models, Measurement, and Cog\u00ad nitive Processes john P. Boyd: Mathematical Anthropology and Systems Theory Michael L. Burton: Cognitive Anthropology, Economic Anthropol\u00ad ogy, Cultural Ecology, Gender Michael Butler: How People Learn and How They Can Learn Better Douglas Chalmers: Problem Drinking, Social Psychology, and Human Rule Systems Linton Freeman: Network Models of Social Structure Tarow lndow: Mathematical Psychology and Perception jerome Kirk: Sociology, Social Anthropology, Social Psychology, Social Control, and Politics Louis Narens: Measurement and Logic Robert Newcomb: Statistics, Research Methods in the Social Sci\u00ad ences and Education, Use of Computers in Education A. Kimball Romney: Experimental and Psychological Anthropology David A. Smith: Urbanization, Comparative/Historical Sociology, Political Sociology, World-System Analysis Christian Werner: Mathematical Social Science Douglas R. White: Anthropology, Social Networks and Relations, Cross-Cultural Comparison, Mathematical Models of Social Constraints, Decision-Making Networks, and Social Processes Faculty in Mathematical Social Science offer a concentration in Social Networks that stresses the development of a per\u00ad spective which focuses on the patterns or forms of the struc\u00ad tures of relations that link persons or other social actors together in coherent wholes. Thus, Social Networks has abstracted out the structural parts of each of these fields. It is concerned with problems of representing such structures, both statically and dynamically, and with exploring the implications of structural form for individual and collective behavior. In addition, the networks perspective has important applications in the study of inter\u00ad national relations, organizational behavior, health and mental health, and human communications research. Admission The graduate concentration in Social Networks seeks quali\u00ad fied graduate students who are well-trained in either (a) a structural approach in some traditional social science disci\u00ad pline or (b) mathematics. Students also should be willing to learn either a set of social science orientations and models or the appropriate mathematical skills to do research in social networks, depending upon their prior training. Students normally are expected to have a grade point average above 3.0 and scores on the two parts of the Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test which total more than 1,100. Decisions on admission are strongly influenced by let\u00ad ters of recommendation and the statement of student interest. Requirements Students are encouraged to develop their own research foci and specializations within the general social networks per\u00ad spective. All students are expected to become acquainted with the general perspective and to develop a minimum set of formal and methodological skills. A set of core courses has been developed that is aimed at acquainting incoming students with theoretical, mathemati\u00ad cal, and methodological tools for the study of social networks. Selection of other courses will be by agreement between the student and their advisor. In addition to relevant courses offered throughout the School, courses specifically tailored for students in Social Networks are offered by the Mathe\u00ad matical Social Science Group faculty on a regular basis. Reviews and Examinations Students enrolled in the concentration are expected to meet the requirements of UCI and the School as well as those of the concentration. In addition, each student is reviewed three times to ascertain progress. The first review is conducted by Mathematical Social Science faculty on the basis of each student's first-year performance. The review results in a faculty-student conference in which a recommendation is made for continuation or withdrawal. The second review concerns the student's qualification for advancement to candidacy and is conducted by a committee consisting of at least three Mathematical Social Science faculty and two other faculty from the campus or one from the campus and one from another University of California campus. The examination is designed to assess the likelihood of the student successfully completing the Ph.D. dissertation and is based on the student's dissertation research proposal as well as on the progress in course work. Students are expected to complete this examination on or before the end of their third year of residence. The third review is a dissertation defense. The defense will be in the form of a public colloquium presentation. The faculty may recommend revisions, after which the disserta\u00ad tion may be submitted for the doctoral degree in Social \u00b7Science. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988J Social Sciences 213 Established in 1963, the UCI Library collection now contains more than 1,200,000 volumes, the ma;orily of which are housed in open slacks and are easily accessible to readers.

Waitzkin: Comparative Health Care Systems, Primary Care and Community Medicine, Doctor-Patient Communication Douglas R. White: Cross-Cultural Research, Mathematical Anthro\u00ad pology, Social Networks The doctoral program in Social Relations offers graduate stu\u00ad dents a broad range of intellectual choices, as evidenced by the array of particular interests of the faculty. The program's faculty is committed to an interdisciplinary conceptualization and analysis of social relations, particularly where the tradi\u00ad tional concerns of sociology and anthropology converge. Because of a low student-to-faculty ratio, each student works closely with a faculty committee to develop an individualized course of study. Students may focus their studies in a number of the major areas of social science with special emphasis on cognitive anthropology and the sociology of cul\u00ad ture, culture and health practices, family and gender, and Third World development and social change. Admissions The faculty welcomes students from diverse educational and social backgrounds. Students who have research interests corresponding to those of specific faculty members are espe\u00ad cially encouraged to apply to this apprenticeship-type pro\u00ad gram. They should familiarize themselves with the publica\u00ad tions of the faculty before applying. Requirements Students are admitted by the entire Social Relations faculty. Each new student is assigned an advisor who serves until a three-person committee is formed, which occurs by the mid\u00ad dle of the second year of residence. The committee oversees the student's academic work and ordinarily is chaired by the faculty member with whom the student plans to work most closely. A core seminar which meets weekly throughout the year is required of first-year graduate students. Additionally, three basic courses in particular substantive areas of anthropology and sociology are offered each year as core courses. In each of their first two years, students must take two of these three focused seminars. Two quarters of statistics, computer science, or other appropriate analytical methods are required. Students also take additional seminars pertinent to their own research interests. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 214 Social Sciences Course work usually takes two years, during which time stu\u00ad dents choose an area of concentration. By the end of the third year, students are expected to have selected a faculty committee and to have made plans for their doctoral disserta\u00ad tion research. All students are expected to continue to partic\u00ad ipate in both the Social Relations Colloquium Series and in less formal aspects of intellectual life in the program. Reviews During the first year each student will prepare an original paper, which will be presented by the student at a meeting during the spring quarter. The group will provide the student with a detailed written critique of the paper as part of the first-year evaluation of the student's overall progress. The second review takes the form of an advancement-to\u00ad candidacy examination. This ordinarily is conducted by the student's committee and two additional faculty members from the campus. Students are expected to take this exami\u00ad nation no later than the spring quarter of their third year. Satisfactory completion of the dissertation is the final requirement in completing the Ph.D. Foreign Language A speaking or reading knowledge of one foreign language is required. Courses in Social Sciences Courses in the School do not invariably resemble conven\u00ad tional university courses either in content or in format. Stu\u00ad dents at any level are encouraged to suggest areas of individ\u00ad ual study and may (with faculty approval) pursue any intel\u00ad lectually challenging area within the social sciences. Such courses may include special seminars, study projects, individ\u00ad ual papers, or any other useful educational activity. The faculty encourages students to present evidence that they have done interesting and original work and to receive offi\u00ad cial credit for that work by enrolling in an individual study course. Such courses are numbered 198 and 199 (undergrad\u00ad uate) and 299 (graduate). Students from other schools are encouraged to take courses and talk with faculty within the School. In addition to the introductory courses, many of the upper-division courses are open to students without previous work in social science. Since many of the courses touch on several areas of social science, a list of major areas of concentration or \"emphases\" is often included in the description of a course. The classifica\u00ad tion terms used for this purpose are anthropology, compara\u00ad tive culture, economics, geography, linguistics, political science, psychology, and sociology. Most upper-division courses are arranged in modules in order to provide con\u00ad tinuity over individual courses, to facilitate long-range plan\u00ad ning by students, and to encourage the pursuit of interdisci\u00ad plinary programs of study. Students are encouraged to take advantage of the module concept to acquire experience in several integrated sets of courses. If is not necessary, however, for students to take all courses listed in a module; module courses may be taken individually, as long as course prerequisites have been met. The specific courses offered in module form may vary from year to year, but the structure of the curriculum will remain stable. Ordinarily, a student can expect to find at least one module offered in each broad area each year. By observing the content area of courses and by making effective use of module sequences, a student can assemble an individual pro\u00ad gram of study in a particular discipline or in an interdiscipli\u00ad nary area. Listed below are course descriptions of some of the proposed courses to be offered during 1987-88. A final listing of the courses offered will be available prior to the beginning of each quarter in 122 Social Science Tower. Students who are interested in obtaining this material may receive copies by visiting or writing to the School of Social Sciences. NOTE: Students who entered UCI before fall quarter, 1987, should refer to the 1986-8 7 UCI General Catalogue and previous editions for information on the course numbering and lettering sys\u00ad tem prior to fall 1987. Anthropology Anthropology is the comparative study of past and contem\u00ad porary human societies and cultures.

These prob\u00ad lems include predicting the orbit of a satellite, simulating the economy, keeping track of inventories, and sending mail elec\u00ad tronically. Such problems are solved by having the computer execute a procedure-a sequence of information processing operations including, but not limited to, arithmetic opera\u00ad tions, testing and comparing numbers and representations of alphabetic information, and changing the sequence of opera\u00ad tions within the computer. Information and computer science is concerned with the development of procedures which are effective and efficient, languages suitable for stating these procedures, systems for executing procedures, and with the study of the social setting in which procedures are used. The implications of research in information and computer science extend beyond direct applications of the modern dig\u00ad ital computer. Many animate and inanimate systems can be usefully viewed as information processing systems and ana\u00ad lyzed in terms of the way they represent, store, and process information. Thus, information and computer science pro\u00ad vides a point of view, an approach, for studying phenomena in many sciences. Computing resources available on the campus include inter\u00ad active access to the systems in the UCI Computing Facility\u00ad a Honeywell DPS8/49C (CP6), a DEC VAX 11/780 (VMS), and a VAX 11/785 (VMS) and an Encore Multimax (UNIX). UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Information and Computer Science 239 The ma}or in Information and Computer Science provides students with the opportunity to study the underlying principles, cur~ent'practices,mlli probal>le future trends of computer science. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 240 Information and Computer Science Computing resources for instruction within the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS) include three microcomputer laboratories (using Toshiba T300s, Corona Personal Computers, Apple Macintoshes, and Apple Lisas), a workstation laboratory with 10 Sun 3/50 graphics work\u00ad stations (UNIX), four Hewlett Packard 9836 graphics work\u00ad stations (HPUX), two HP 9040 multiuser systems, a DEC VAX 11/750 (UNIX), an Integrated Solutions system (UNIX), and a Sequent Balance 21000 multiprocessor shared memory system (DYNIX). Departmental computing resources for research include four DEC VAX 11/750s (UNIX), 50 Sun 3 workstations (UNIX), a Symbolics Lisp Machine, and several Integrated Solutions 68020 based systems (UNIX). Transfer students entering college prior to fall 1987 and who transfer to UCI within four years of the date of their first entering college are required to have the following: a min\u00ad imum of 56 semester units/84 quarter; two years of transfer\u00ad able college mathematics, including one year of calculus; completion of one year of computer science courses, includ\u00ad ing the equivalent of ICS 1A or 1B; sufficient transferable credits to satisfy the majority of breadth requirements, and satisfaction of the lower-division writing requirement (one year of college English composition), and a competitive grade point average (since only a limited number of applicants can be accepted into the program). Students who enter college fall1987 or thereafter and who subsequently transfer to UCI in ICS will be held to the fol\u00ad lowing requirements: 1. A minimum of 56 semester (or 84 quarter) units. 2. Two years of college mathematics, including one year of calculus. The second year should consist of courses equiva\u00ad lent to Mathematics 6A-B-C, if available. Otherwise courses may be chosen from the second year of calculus, linear alge\u00ad bra, and statistics to meet admissions requirements. 3. Completion of one year of computer science courses, including a programming course involving concepts such as are found in Pascal, Ada, or another modern, high-level lan\u00ad guage. Programming-only courses in languages such as BASIC, COBOL, and FORTRAN are not sufficient. 4. Sufficient transferable credits to satisfy the majority of breadth requirements and satisfaction of the lower-division writing requirement (one year of college English composition). 5. Competitive grade point average, since only a limited number of students can be accepted. Note: The lower-division requirements in ICS consist of five courses which must be taken in sequence and completed before going on to upper-division course work. Students who transfer to UCI and must complete any or all of this sequence will therefore find that it will take longer than two years to complete their degrees. Alternately, lower-division eligible transfer students can come to the campus without declaring a major, take the courses necessary to meet the ICS change-of-major require\u00ad ments, and then apply for a change of major. On the basis of our experience over the past several years, we anticipate that the number of incoming freshmen and advanced-standing students who elect ICS as a major will exceed the number of positions available. In recent years less than half of the incoming applicants who elected ICS were admitted to the major and we expect this trend to continue. To ensure that their application is considered for the fall of 1988, students should be sure to file their application so it arrives on campus before November 30, 1987. The selection criteria will include grades, test scores, and affirmative action considerations. Students interested in using computers as an adjunct to their major field of study may enroll in the introductory pro\u00ad gramming sequence (ICS 21, 22, 23). Degrees Information magna cum laude, summa cum laude, are awarded to approximately 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Students are nominated for honors based on criteria such as grade point average (including over\u00ad all, ICS, mathematics); number of upper-division ICS courses completed beyond the minimum; courses taken outside ICS beyond required breadth; and research activities. To be eligi\u00ad ble for honors, a general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Careers for the ICS Major Students with undergraduate degrees in Information and Computer Science have been successful in finding career opportunities in recent years. Entry-level positions have included programming, systems analysis, marketing, and sales support. Individual career counseling, career informa\u00ad tion and job opportunities, and workshops on job search techniques are available through the campus Career Planning and Placement Center. A Bachelor's degree in Information and Computer Science can be part of a preparatory program for graduate work in computer science or a related field. Undergraduate Program The major in Information and Computer Science (ICS) pro\u00ad vides serious students the opportunity to study the underly\u00ad ing principles, current practice, and probable future trends of computer science. Just as it is important for students to acquire a broad and basic education in the major segments of modern academic study, it is essential that they obtain an educational foundation that will permit them to learn and keep up with the expanding field of computer science. It is this focus on foundations for lifelong learning that is the hallmark of the ICS undergraduate program. The ICS curriculum enables students to study basic concepts and practice of data organization, algorithm design, organiza\u00ad tion of systems (hard and soft), software system design and construction, theoretical models and analysis, artificial intelli\u00ad gence, and the nature of the personal, social, and organiza\u00ad tional impact of computers. In the process of mastering the ICS curriculum, students learn several current programming languages, operating systems, support tools such as graphics packages, and hardware systems. Students also learn to use various current systems aimed at improving personal productivity. These objectives provide a basis for professional work and graduate study in computer science and sophisticated applica\u00ad tions of computers. While many ICS graduates are success\u00ad fully pursuing careers in a variety of fields, including many kinds of applications, the curriculum focuses on the underly\u00ad ing principles of computer science rather than on specific UC IRVINE - 1987-1988applications. Students whose interests are primarily applications-oriented are encouraged to pursue in-depth study in another field, combined with a selection of basic courses in ICS. Note: The award of a B.S. degree in ICS requires that stu\u00ad dents complete the course requirements for the degree and that they be enrolled in the ICS major. Although many stu\u00ad dents would like to change their major to the ICS major, there are insufficient spaces to accommodate all such peti\u00ad tions. Students who would like to change their major to ICS should contact the ICS Undergraduate Counseling Office to discuss their plans. Students enrolled in other degree programs who are inter\u00ad ested in digital computer programming will normally begin their studies with Introduction to Computer Science I (ICS 21) and continue in the programming sequence with Intro\u00ad duction to Computer Science II and III (ICS 22 and 23) as far as their interests require and their programs permit. Stu\u00ad dents who are doing, or planning to do, extensive work with numerical problems are advised to consider courses in numer\u00ad ical analysis, statistics, probability, or other applied mathemat\u00ad ics areas. Students interested in courses in computer engineering and digital systems should consult the list of courses offered by the School of Engineering. Students can declare a double major in Engineering and ICS; early consultation on such a double major is advisable. The ICS Undergraduate Counseling Office is staffed by pro\u00ad fessional academic counselors and peer advisors. These indi\u00ad viduals are available to assist students with program plan\u00ad ning, questions on University and departmental policies and procedures, progress toward graduaticm, and other questions that arise in the course of a student's education. Faculty also are available for advising, generally for suggestions of addi\u00ad tional course work in the student's area of specialization and on preparation for graduate school. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. Departmental Requirements Lower-division (these must be completed prior to taking required upper-division ICS courses): Mathematics 6A-B-C and 2A-B-C; ICS 21, 22, 23, 51, 52. Upper-division: ICS 121, 131, 141, 151, 161, 171; two projects courses selected from ICS 1258, 135, 145A or B, 155A orB, 165, 175; one course in each of two areas, selected from ICS 132, 142 or 143, 152, 162, 172; three upper-division mathematics courses selected from the following list, includ\u00ad ing at least two courses with the same number (Mathematics 120 and 121 are considered to have the same number): Mathe\u00ad matics in Information and Computer Science The honors program in ICS provides an opportunity for selected students to pursue advanced work in one of the research areas in the Department. Admission to the program is based on a formal application normally submitted at the end of the sophomore year. Entering transfer students who have not completed all lower-division work may submit appli\u00ad cations at the end of their first year at UCI, providing the conditions for application have been satisfied. Information and CompJter Science 241 The Computer Science Building houses classrooms. lecture halls. administrative offices, and the UCI Computing Faciliiy, the central mmpus computing resource. For an application to be considered, three conditions must be met (although exceptions may be granted in unusual circum\u00ad stances): (1) achievement of an overall grade point average of at least 3.2; (2) completion of the required lower-division ICS courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5; and (3) completion of Mathematics 6A-B-C with a grade point average of at least 3.5. In selecting students for invitation to join the honors program, the Department considers evidence of the student's ability and interest in research. Successful completion of the program requires participation in the ICS Honors Seminar (ICS 197) and a minimum of two quarters of independent, supervised work (ICS 198), which may be used to satisfy one of the projects courses required for the major. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Outstanding students who are interested in a career in man\u00ad agement and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for their UC IRVINE - 1987-1988242 Information and Computer Science bachelor's degree by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in Business Administration (M.B.A.) along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average required is 3.2 overall. Com\u00ad pletion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram. Upon admission, senior-year students will take courses in management which will count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful com\u00ad pletion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Prbgram, the bachelor's degree will be awarded. The GSM master's degree will be awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Graduate School of Management section and contact the GSM counseling office. Graduate Program Master of Science Program The Master of Science degree in Information and Computer Science is awarded only to Ph.D. students who complete necessary requirements. Students are not admitted for grad\u00ad uate study leading only to the Master's degree. Ph.D. Program The graduate program in Information and Computer Science leads to a Ph.D. degree. The program is research-oriented and encourages students to work together with faculty to solve advanced problems in computer science. Current research activities include analysis of algorithms, artificial intelligence, machine architecture, programming environ\u00ad ments, software engineering, computer-aided instruction, and the study of the interrelation of computing, organiza\u00ad tions, policy, and society. The Department receives substan\u00ad tial extramural funding. The Ph.D. program is designed for full-time study, and can be completed in four to five years, depending upon the focus of research. Admission Applications are evaluated on the basis of the student's prior academic record and potential for creative professional con\u00ad tributions. Applicants are expected to have good skills in computer programming and skills in mathematics equivalent to those obtained by students who complete college-level courses in logic and set theory, analysis, linear algebra, and modern algebra or probability and statistics. Computer sci\u00ad ence undergraduate training is not required, but some famil\u00ad iarity with machine organization, data structures, software systems, and formal models is helpful. Applicants should take both the GRE General Test and the GRE Subject Test in Computer Science. Personal interviews are desirable but not required. Additional information about the graduate program in Information and Computer Science and application forms may be obtained by writing to the Graduate Counselor in the Department. Financial Assistance Financial assistance is available to students in the form of teaching and research assistantships. There are some research and teaching assistantships available for the summer as well. More than half of the doctoral students in residence receive financial assistance. General Requirements for the Ph.D. The Ph.D. program has three phases. Phase I. Breadth: The purpose of the breadth phase is to develop the student's understanding of broad areas in compu\u00ad ter science. Understanding is certified by satisfactory perfor\u00ad mance in core courses. Nine graduate courses must be taken as designated by the faculty, with no grade below a B. These courses include four core courses plus one course from each of the five concentrations. Students must complete Phase I by the end of their second year. Phase II. Depth: The purpose of the depth phase is to develop research skills and creative problem solving ability. The stu\u00ad dent must select an area of specialization and 1. demonstrate deep understanding of that area by satisfac\u00ad tory performance in two advanced courses and on a written comprehensive examination 2. pass one other advanced course of the student's choice 3. demonstrate research ability by preparing a survey paper and a research paper of publishable or near-publishable quality 4. present a research colloquium 5. receive approval from the faculty to take a Candidacy Oral Examination 6. pass the Candidacy Oral Examination conducted by a for\u00ad mal candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies. The area of specialization is normally one of the Depart\u00ad ment's five concentrations: architecture and operating sys\u00ad tems; software; theory of algorithms and data structures; artificial intelligence; computing, organizations, policy, and society (CORPS). However, an area of specialization other than one of the above concentrations may be chosen with the approval of the graduate advisor. . All students in the Ph.D. program are eligible to be awarded an M.S. degree upon completion of all requirements of Phases I and II of the Ph.D. program except for the Candi\u00ad dacy Examination. Phase III. Dissertation: This phase is devoted almost exclu\u00ad sively to the dissertation. When the student has passed the formal qualifying examination and advanced to candidacy, a doctoral committee is appointed to supervise the dissertation and approve it on behalf of the Graduate Council. Teaching Requirement: All ICS doctoral students are required to participate in teaching activities before being advanced to candidacy. Teaching activities in summer or night school, service at other universities, etc., may be accepted as fulfillment of the requirement. Programming Competence Requirement: A computer scien\u00ad tist must be able to read and write programs in assembly, algebraic, and nonnumericallanguages. Lower-Division Courses Note: Students who entered UCI prior to falll987 who need ICS 2 and 2L to complete their degree requirements should take ICS 51; students who need to complete ICS 3 should take ICS 23.

Harvard University, Professor of Social Ecol\u00ad ogy (moral development, educational environments, late adoles\u00ad cent to early adult development) The Program in Social Ecology applies interdisciplinary scien\u00ad tific methods to the study of a wide range of recurring social and environmental problems. Among the issues of longstand\u00ad ing interest to the Program are violence in society, social influences on normal and atypical human development over the life span, and aspects of the physical environment which have an impact on human health and behavior. The faculty of Social Ecology is multidisciplinary. It includes psychologists who have specialized in developmental, envi\u00ad ronmental, community, and social environmental health scien\u00ad tists; and lawyers. While faculty members are firmly grounded in these parent disciplines and teach basic courses UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Social Ecology 247 -t t - \u00b7work;lace productivity is an~ly~ed in the Enviromnertill Sim~lation i.nbo'rator~ locate/in the. Social Ecology Building. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988248 Social Ecology in them, they concentrate their efforts on teaching and research with a problem orientation. In these problem\u00ad oriented courses, they integrate concepts and perspectives of several disciplines. This focus arises from commitment to the view that the analysis of complex societal problems requires interdisciplinary efforts (i.e., the joining of talents by people with different intellectual backgrounds). Another feature of instruction in Social Ecology is the use of lecturers from the community, individuals whose academic qualifications are complemented by their experiences with practical applica\u00ad tions. For example, a judge, an architect, a counseling psy\u00ad chologist, and a former police officer are among those who teach courses in the Program. A number of social ecologists are involved in interventions directed toward improving the way groups of individuals, institutions, and communities function; a number of others are involved in interventions aimed at improving the quality and control of the environment. Research Facilities The Social Ecology Building features several facilities for experimental research, including wet laboratories for research and teaching in the environmental health sriences; behavioral assessment laboratories for research in human development, social relations, and legal studies; and an envi\u00ad ronmental simulation laboratory for studying the effects of environmental conditions. The wet laboratories are used for studying air and water pollution. The behavioral assessment. laboratories are used for study of parent-child interaction, cooperation among children, hyperactivity, and mock jury discussions. The environmental simulation laboratory per\u00ad mits full-scale, realistic simulations of interior environments such as offices, classrooms, and apartments. Within these set\u00ad tings, physical conditions (e.g., ambient lighting and color patterns, music and noise, spatial arrangements and physical density) and social processes (e.g., group communication patterns) can be varied experimentally so that researchers can assess the separate and joint effects of these conditions and processes upon occupants' performance and well-being. Degrees Social Ecology .......................... B.A., M.A., Ph.D. Applied Ecology (offered jointly with the School of Biological Sciences) .............. B.A. Honors Honors at graduation will be awarded to about 12 percent of the graduating seniors. Initial eligibility for such honors will be on the basis of grade point average. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in resi\u00ad dence at a University of California campus. Final decisions concerning the awards of summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude are the responsibility of a committee chaired by the Associate Director for Undergraduate Studies. Honors Program in Social Ecology The Social Ecology Honors Program provides the opportun\u00ad ity for selected students majoring in Social Ecology to pursue advanced independent study. Admission to the program is based on formal application normally submitted in the spring quarter of the junior year. In order to be considered, a stu\u00ad dent must have satisfied the following requirements: comple\u00ad tion of all lower-division Social Ecology courses required for the major; completion of at least five upper-division Social Ecology courses with a grade point average of at least 3.5 in these courses; and achievement of an overall grade point average at UCI of at least 3.2. Invitation to the program is based upon evidence of the student's ability, interest in research, and proposed thesis project. Successful completion of the program requires two quarters of supervised, inde\u00ad pendent work on a thesis research project (Social Ecology H190) and written and oral presentation of an honors thesis (Social Ecology H190W). Career Opportunities Graduates of the Program in Social Ecology bring a distinc\u00ad tive cross-disciplinary perspective to the job market. The Program provides a solid foundation for those students who seek jobs in planning departments, mental health settings, educational institutions, and a variety of community and governmental agencies. Many Social Ecology students find that their interdisciplinary training is also useful for careers in management and personnel. The Program also provides sound preparation for students who wish to apply to graduate and professional schools of law, administration, public health, social welfare, psychology, sociology, criminology, and urban planning. Undergraduate Program in Social Ecology The Social Ecology major offers either a general interdiscipli\u00ad nary degree in Social Ecology or a more focused experience through one of three specializations: Psychology and Social Behavior; Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Legal Studies; and Environmental Health and Planning. The specialization designation will be noted on the student's transcript upon graduation. A minor in Social Ecology is offered for students who wish to be exposed to an interdisciplinary, scientific orientation toward environmental, social, and criminal justice problems while pursuing another major. The Social Ecology faculty believes that an exposure to the components of the Pro\u00ad gram's curriculum is valuable to the educated individual. Pro\u00ad gram components include an integrative theoretical frame\u00ad work, an understanding of the research world, and familiar\u00ad ity with the use of scientific information in problem solving and policy making. Field Study An important aspect of the undergraduate program is its field study requirement for majors. Field study is open only to upper-division Social Ecology majors. Field study is designed to provide students with an opportunity to examine social\u00ad environmental problems as they occur in community set\u00ad tings; to evaluate the merit of ideas presented in the class\u00ad room; and to conduct naturalistic observations and investiga\u00ad tions at field sites. Under the supervision of a Social Ecology faculty sponsor, students are encouraged to evaluate proce\u00ad dures and problem-solving strategies used in the work place and to observe the links between community practices and academic ideas and issues. . The settings provided for field study include a wide range of problem-oriented institutions and agencies in both the pri\u00ad vate and the public sector, (e.g., Orange County Public Defender's Office, Orange County Social Services, health care agencies, city planning departments, primary and secon\u00ad dary schools, private law firms, correctional facilities, and police departments). Other field study placements may oe generated by faculty and students to fit their particular inter\u00ad ests. All field studies are taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis and require Departmental approval. Further information on field study, including information about sign-up procedures and prerequisites, must be obtained from the Social Ecology Counseling Office. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Environmental Health and Planning The Environmental Health and Planning specialization is con\u00ad cerned with the impact of the physicalenvironment on human health and behavior. Students begin with basic courses in human ecology, environmental quality, environ\u00ad mental psychology, urban sociology, and planning and public policy. Subsequent course work moves toward problem\u00ad oriented courses in these areas, enriched by ongoing faculty and student research on such topics as the effects of envir\u00ad onmental stressors (e.g., crowding, smog, noise); the biology and politics of water pollution; compliance with environmen\u00ad tal regulations; the way in which economic changes in a community affect the health and well-being of its residents; the effects of stress on health; and the social effects of urbanization. In addition to providing basic knowledge for students in other areas, courses are relevant to professional careers in the areas of administration, environmental quality and health, environmental impact assessment, and community environmental education. Graduate and professional oppor\u00ad tunities related to environmental analysis include urban and regional planning, architecture, environmental psychology, ecology, public health, and urban sociology. Special emphasis is placed upon the roles of individual citizens and community organizations, both governmental and private, in maintaining and enhancing the quality of the human environment. Field study is done in city planning departments, private architec\u00ad tural firms, environmental information centers, pollution control agencies, and health agencies. Specialization in Environmental Health and Planning Following the completion of Social Ecology E8 (Introduction to Environmental Analysis), students must complete six courses from the following list: El01 Social Ecology of Science and Technology E108 Spatial Structure of Metropolitan Areas SliD Human Stress E111 Survey Analysis of Urban Residents El12A-B Design and Behavior I, II EllS Social Stratification E119 Urban and Regional Analysis E120 Topics in Applied Ecology E121 Topics in Environmental Health E125 Microbial Ecology of Natural and Polluted Waters E130 Urban Issues, Policy, and Theory E132 Urban Sociology E136 Social Ecology of the Borderlands E139 Urbanization and Social Change E140 The Chemical Components of Water Quality E142 Race Relations 145 Introduction to Program Evaluation E149 Life in Space E150 Environmental Impact Studies E153 Chronological Dating Techniques in Environmental Reconstruction E155 Environmental Chemistry E157 Strategies of Health Promotion E158 Community Health: An Epidemiological Approach E159 Environment and Health 5159 The Family E162 Environmental Law El67 A History of Water Pollution: Biological E167B History of Water Pollution: Chemical 5169 Gender and Society E171 Dynamics of Human Populations E172 Social Planning E173 Human Ecology E175 Environmental Reconstruction Social Ecology 249 E175L Laboratory for Environmental Analysis E176 Planning Theory E177 Analysis of Metropolitan Areas E187 Environmental Psychology E188 Advanced Environmental Psychology: Facilities Design for the Workplace E189 Environmental Design Research Methods The following lower-division courses are recommended: ES Introduction to Environmental Quality and Health E7 Introduction to Planning and Public Policy Psychology and Social Behavior The Psychology and Social Behavior specialization is con\u00ad cerned with human behavior in social contexts. A major objective is to study variations in social environments (e.g., the family, school, workplace) that affect development over the life cycle. Students begin with basic course work in human development, social psychology, community psychol\u00ad ogy, and abnormal psychology. Subsequent course work examines such topics as psychosocial development in chil\u00ad dren, adolescents, and adults; gerontology; sex differences; attitude change; the evaluation of social programs; psychol\u00ad ogy and the law; the effects of stress on psychological adjustment; counseling and psychotherapy. Opportunities also are available to work with faculty on research in these and other areas. Students are given a foundation that will enable them to work after graduation from UCI in the private or public sec\u00ad tors or to do graduate work in psychology, human develop\u00ad ment, social work, counseling, or education. Approximately SO agencies are available for field study in this specialization, including schools, child care facilities, community clinics, counseling centers, hospital settings, and social service agencies. Specialization in Psychology and Social Behavior Following the completion of 59 (Introduction to Human Behavior), students must complete six upper-division courses from among the following. Listed courses are arranged in course groupings that represent the major areas of psychol\u00ad ogy within the Program in Social Ecology: Developmental Psychology, Environmental Psychology, Social Psychology, Clinical Psychology, Health Psychology, and Psychology arid Social Problems. Developmental Psychology 5113 Infant Development 5122 Human Sexuality 5123 Adolescent Development 5125 Adult Development 5126 Social Policy and Human Development 5127 Child Development 5128 Perspectives on the Development of the Child 5132 Gerontology 5145 Perspectives on Child Rearing 5148 Development of Sex Differences Strongly recommended: 511 Human Development Over the Life Cycle Environmental Psychology E112A-B Design and Behavior E187 Environmental Psychology E188 Advanced Environmental Psychology: Facilities Design for the Workplace E189 Environmental Design Research Methods Social Psychology E111 Survey Analysis of Urban Residents 5117 Social Relationships 5118 Interviewing and Assessment UC IRVINE - 1987-1988250 Social Ecology Jl33 Deviance 5138 Attitude Organization and Change 5143 Attitudes and Behavior 5159 The Family 166D Introduction to Survey Analysis E174 Seminar in Social Psychological Perspectives on Human Fertility 5181 Leadership Strongly recommended: 586 Introduction to Social Psychology Clinical Psychology SIOIA-B Counseling Theory 5104 Behavioral Assessment SIOS Developmental Disabilities 5106 Clinical Child Psychology 5107 Child Therapies 5109 Cognitive Behavior Therapy SU6 Peer Counseling 5156 Developmental Psychopathology 5156 Introduction to Clinical Psychology E165 Health and the Social Environment 5166 Behavior Modification 5170 Personality Strongly recommended: 520 Abnormal Behavior Health Psychology SUO Human Stress SUS Aging and Health SISO Child Health Psychology E158 Community Health: An Epidemiological Approach 5160 Advanced Seminar: Human Stress 5186 Sports Psychology Psychology and Social Problems 5108 Social Ecology of Child Abuse and Neglect 5120 Violence in Society JI32 Juvenile Delinquency J133 Deviance 145 Introduction to Program Evaluation 5154 Work and the Family 5165 Sociology of Mental Health and Illness S 171 Social Conflict S 178 Social Ecology of Peace I 5185 Impacts of Divorce Jl90 Psychology and the Law Strongly recommended courses for students who anticipate pursuing graduate study in psychology: Biological Sciences 79, 80, 81 (Biological Bases of Behavior) Social Ecology 166A-B-C (Social Science Statistics) Elective units: Social Sciences ISlA (Experimental Psychol\u00ad ogy), Social Sciences 152D (Learning Theory), and Social Sciences 152E (Human Memory) Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Legal Studies The Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Legal Studies speciali\u00ad zation is concerned with the social control of criminality and violence and with the relationship between society and its legal institutions. Basic courses cover forms of criminal behavior and introduce the student to the workings of the American legal system. Subsequent course work is comple\u00ad mented by ongoing faculty and student research on such top\u00ad ics as the determinants of police decisions to shoot; character\u00ad istics of persons and of situations that promote intervention by \"good Samaritans\" at the scene of crimes; interpersonal violence; the control of delinquency through family counsel\u00ad ing and crisis intervention; jury decision making; prosecutor\u00ad ial decision making; the analysis of court decisions; the deter\u00ad rence of criminal behavior; white collar and corporate crime; and organized crime and corruption. This specialization provides students with opportunities to examine critical issues in regard to criminal and delinquent behavior and official reactions toward violators. The course of study prepares students for careers in justice system administration, probation and parole, law enforcement, and formal corrections, as well as for law school and other gradu\u00ad ate programs including criminology, criminal justice, legal studies, and sociology. Offerings examine social problems that involve crime and society's reactions to these problems, and assess the organization and operation of the criminal jus\u00ad tice system as it now functions. Field study placements are available in police departments, public defenders' offices, pro\u00ad bation and parole agencies, consumer affairs agencies, the State juvenile detention system, the Victim/Witness Assist\u00ad ance Program, the Orange County Legal Services Program, the UCI College Legal Clinic, and in private legal firms. Specialization in Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Legal Studies Following the completion of J4 (introduction to Criminal Jus\u00ad tice), students must complete six of the following courses: 5108 The Social Ecology of Child Abuse and Neglect JU4 Organized Crime and American Society 5120 Violence in Society Jl32 Juvenile Delinquency Jl33 Deviance J134 Victimless Crimes Jl38 Victims of Crime JI40 Prisons, Punishment, and Corrections Jl41 Seminar in Criminal Justice Jl42 White Collar Crime Jl43 Theories of Punishment JI44 Criminal Law JI45 Government Crime JI46 Social Control of Violence Jl47 Law and Social Change JI48 Criminological Theory JISO The Legal Profession 5161 Family Law E162 Environmental Law JI64 Social Control of Delinquency Jl81 Contemporary Legal Issues Jl82 Legal Sanctions and Social Control JI90 Psychology and the Law The following courses are especially recommended to stu\u00ad dents who desire exposure to legal reasoning and analysis in order to help decide whether to pursue a career in law, and to students who wish to learn how to \"think like JI90. These courses are taught by members of the Social Ecology faculty who are lawyers. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. Social Ecology Major Requirements Lower-Division Requirements Social Ecology 1 (Principles of Social Ecology), 10 (Research Design); 13 (Statistical Analysis in Social Ecology); J4 (intro\u00ad Criminal Justice); E8 (Introduction to tal Analysis); and 59 (introduction to Human Behavior). Upper-Division Requirements Ten upper-division Social Ecology courses (numbered 100-196), 197 A (Studies in Field Settings); two quarters (eight units) of 197 (Field Study) taken during junior and senior years. Students must complete required prerequisite courses prior to field study enrollments; open only to Social Ecology majors. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988In order to remain in good standing and be eligible for grad\u00ad uation from the Program in Social Ecology, a student must maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.0 in all re\u00ad quired lower-division Social Ecology courses (1, 10, 13, ]4, E8, 59) and also in the 10 required Social Ecology upper-division courses (100-196) plus 197 A. Planning a Program of Study Students who major in Social Ecology, although they may be specializing in a single area of interest, are encouraged to develop an appreciation of a wide array of person\u00ad environment problems. The strongest program of study also includes basic course work in at least one of the social, biolog\u00ad ical, or physical sciences. Students who enter the major as freshmen should plan to complete the required lower-division courses by the end of the junior year. Transfer students and students who declare a major in Social Ecology after entering UCI should work with the Social Ecology Counseling Office to develop a plan for meeting the requirements of the major in an orderly fashion. The Social Ecology Counseling Office is prepared to help all students in planning a program of study. Contact with this Office is important so that students will develop a broad, yet coherent, series of courses. Students who expect to pursue graduate study should consult also with appropriate faculty members to ensure proper preparation. Undergraduate Major in Applied Ecology The Program in Social Ecology and the School of Biological Sciences offer a program of undergraduate instruction lead\u00ad ing to a B.A. degree in Applied Ecology. The interdisciplinary curriculum furnishes a strong undergraduate foundation for students interested in advanced study in environmental plan\u00ad ning and resource management. An Applied Ecology major receives the basic science training of a Biological Sciences major and utilizes these skills in a core of environmentally based courses taught in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy. Social Ecology brings to this major a unique combination of courses in Environmental Quality and Health, Planning and Public Policy, and Law and Society. This combination, together with a strong biology background contributed by the School of Biological Sciences and a general science back\u00ad ground contributed by the School of Physical Sciences, enables students selecting this major to pursue interdiscipli\u00ad nary learning experiences which are difficult to achieve within traditional disciplines. The first three years of the major are very structured, leaving the last year open for stu\u00ad dents to specialize in an area of their choice. Careers in Applied Ecology Careers in the fields of environmental and resource man\u00ad agement and planning are particularly suited to an Applied Ecology background. Many graduates hold technical or admin\u00ad istrative positions in, for example, the United States Environ\u00ad mental Protection Agency; or in California's Regional Water Quality Control Board, Air Resources Board, Department of Fish and Game, and Department of Health and Human Ser\u00ad vices; or in various county and city agencies. A variety of firms in the private sector employ Applied Ecology graduates to prepare environmental impact reports, laboratory anal\u00ad yses, and planning studies. Industrial health professionals are in demand to help determine the safety of workplace environ\u00ad ments for the labor force. The Applied Ecology major also provides a strong academic foundation for graduate or pro\u00ad fessional study in areas such as conservation and natural resources, environmental health science, microbiology, public health, law, planning, and administration. Social Ecology 251 The Applied Ecology major provides students with a compre\u00ad hensive treatment of basic ecological principles and their relevance to human needs. As an alternate pathway, students with an engineering perspective are encouraged to explore the program options in Environmental Engineering offered by the School of Engineering. Also, students are encouraged to explore the concentration in Ecology and Environmental Biology, leading to a B.S. degree in Biological Sciences, offered by the School of Biological Sciences. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree in Applied Ecology University Requirements: See pages 48-SO; the Applied Ecol\u00ad ogy degree combines breadth and major requirements. Applied Ecology Requirements The University breadth requirements are incorporated within the Applied Ecology curriculum; no additional coursework is required to complete the breadth (general education) requirements.

There are many required courses, and the student must plan carefully. For initial academic advising, students should consult the Social Ecology Counseling Office (163 Social Ecology Building) or the Biological Sciences Student Affairs Office. Faculty aca\u00ad demic advisors may be either Social Ecology or Biological Sciences faculty members. Undergraduate Minor in Social Ecology Social Ecology Minor Requirements Lower-Division Requirements J4 Introduction to Criminal Justice E8 Introduction to Environmental Analysis\u00b7 59 Introduction to Human Behavior Upper-Division Requirements Students must complete five upper-division courses selected from Social Ecology courses numbered 100-196 and all within one specialization (Environmental Health and Planning; Criminology, Criminal Justice, and Legal Studies; Psychology and Social Behavior). Additional Curricular Options Social Ecology majors may combine their course work with the following University programs and should consult an academic counselor for further information. Education Students who plan to obtain a teaching credential or a higher degree in the field of education should consult with counse\u00ad lors in the Office of Teacher Education early in their college career. Students completing a B.A. in Social Ecology may qualify for a waiver of the Single Subject Credential Exami\u00ad nation. Social Ecology courses that are relevant to a career in education include: For additional information about teaching credentials, refer to the Teacher Education section. The 3-2 Program with the Graduate School of Management Students who are interested in a career in management and who will have completed all of the course requirements (including breadth requirements) for the B.A. in Social Ecol\u00ad ogy by the end of the junior year may apply for entry into the Graduate School of Management's 3-2 Program. This cooperative program leads to a Master's degree in Business Administration (M.B.A.) along with the bachelor's degree. Students should apply early in the junior year. The minimum grade point average req1:1ired is 3.2 overall. Completion of the Graduate Management Admissions Test (GMAT) also is required prior to admission to the 3-2 program. Upon admis\u00ad sion, senior year students take courses in management which count toward the 180 units needed to receive a bachelor's degree. Upon successful completion of the required courses and units, usually at the end of the first year in the 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram, the bachelor's degree is awarded. The GSM master's degree is awarded after completion of all the requirements for the advanced degree, usually at the end of the fifth year. For further information, students should refer to the Gradu\u00ad ate School of Management section and contact the GSM counseling office.

Though the Concentration as such can be elected by any student in the School of Humanities, the School of Social Sciences, or the Program in Social Ecology, the courses of the Concentration are open to all UCI students. Participants in the Concentration must complete the equiva\u00ad lent of nine courses, beginning in the sophomore year with an introductory series and culminating with the Peace and Conflict Forum and its related Seminar, usually taken during the senior year. The student selects the remainder of the courses comprising the Concentration from an approved list of upper-division courses and must organize these choices in consultation with a panel of the participating faculty into a coherent interdisciplinary program complementary to the student's major. Requirements for the Concentration: Three lower-division courses: History 11 (Introduction to Peace and Conflict), Social Science 260 (The Nuclear Arms Race), Physics 16 (Physics of Nuclear Weapons) Five relevant upper-division courses. Among those usually offered are: History 1468 (American Foreign Relations Since World War II), Social Sciences 123G (U.S. Foreign Policy), Social Sciences 1230 (U.S. National Security), Social Sciences 113E (Political Economy of National Defense), Social Sciences 122A-B (Soviet Society and Politics), History 133A-B-C (European International History: 1870-1986), History 195 (Arms Control Simulation), Philosophy 182 (Issues in Social Philosophy), Humanities 198 (Directed Study), Social Ecology 178, 179, 180 (Social Ecology of Peace I, II, III), Social Sciences 161Z (War, Peace, and Gender). With approval of the Global Peace and Conflict Studies faculty, relevant lower-division courses may be substituted for up to two of the five required upper-division courses. A minimum of two quarters of Humanities 180 (same as Social Sciences' 1235 or Social Ecology E184)-Peace and Con\u00ad flict Forum-total of two units maximum for credit. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988One quarter of Humanities 181 (same as Social Sciences 123T or Social Ecology E185)-Peace and Conflict Seminar-total\u00ad ing two units, taken during winter quarter of the senior year. Further information concerning the Concentration in Global Peace and Conflict Studies is available from selected faculty representatives in 535 Social ScienceTower, 300A Humani\u00ad ties Office Building, or 356 Social Ecology Building. Graduate Program in Social Ecology The Program in Social Ecology offers graduate education leading to the Master of Arts and Doctor of Philosophy degrees. Students desiring a Ph.D. should apply directly for the Ph.D. program. Only individuals interested in the M.A. as their final degree in Social Ecology should apply for admis\u00ad sion at the Master's level. The emphasis in Social Ecology graduate study is primarily upon theory and research which have implications for policy and social action. Clinical training is not offered. All applicants for either the M.A. or Ph.D. should submit ,undergraduate transcripts, three letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination General Test scores, and a formal application before February 1. Interested persons may call the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor, (714) 856-5917, for further information. The Program in Social Ecology is organized around the study of contemporary problems in the social and physical environ\u00ad ment. Problems are researched from the diversified view\u00ad points of a multidisciplinary faculty, including specialists in community, environmental, social, developmental, and health psychology; planning; urban sociology; law; criminology; and environmental health. Graduate education emphasizes this multidisciplinary orientation rather than the focused perspec\u00ad tive of a single discipline. Social Ecology is committed to an empirical approach. Pro\u00ad gram evaluation, legal research, quesfionnaire and survey methods, field research, naturalistic observation, and quasi\u00ad experimental techniques are emphasized as much as labora\u00ad tory experimentation. A sampling of faculty research and teaching interests includes, but is not limited to, human stress, psychosocial aspects of physical and emotional health, program evaluation, economic change and behavioral disorders, atypical child development, police use of deadly force, legal sanctions and deterrence, white-collar and organized crime, effects of the physical environment upon social behavior and health, child\u00ad bearing decisions, personality and psychopathology, effects of social environments on early child development, urban decen\u00ad tralization, community studies, social support systems among the elderly, race relations, water quality, air quality, the use of scientific information in public policy formation, the perfor\u00ad mance and health impacts of work environments, and envi\u00ad ronmental regulatory processes. Collaborative research with faculty members is an important component of graduate education in Social Ecology. Prospec\u00ad tive graduate students should contact the Social Ecology Graduate Counselor for more detailed information concern\u00ad ing the current research interests of Social Ecology faculty members. M.A. Program Each incoming Master's student is assigned a faculty advisor with whom the student discusses an individual program of graduate education. The program leading to the M.A. degree requires a thesis and satisfactory completion of seven approved courses (28 units), including the Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), and at least one addi\u00ad tional approved course in statistics or methodology. Other Social Ecology 253 courses should be selected with regard to the student's aca\u00ad demic and career objectives, and must be approved by the faculty advisor. The seven required courses must include at least five graduate courses and must be exclusive of any directed study, independent study, or thesis courses (298, 299, or 295). One four-unit field study (297) course may be counted as one of the seven required courses. A grade of B or better must be achieved in all courses. Students are advanced to candidacy for the M.A. degree, and a thesis committee appointed, after a review of their graduate work and thesis plans by a faculty committee. All M.A. students who have not advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each academic year. At that time the faculty may recommend that the student con\u00ad tinue toward the M.A. or cease study in the Program. Eval\u00ad uation of M.A. students who have advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's Master's thesis committee. One year of academic residence is required, but completion of all M.A. requirements, including a thesis approved by the student's committee, ordinarily takes about two years. The M.A. degree in Social Ecology may be useful in obtaining a variety of positions. Many recent M.A. graduates are now employed in federal, state, county, city, and private agencies in such areas as planning, mental health and welfare, and probation and parole. A number of students with the Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology have entered Ph.D. programs at other universities. Ph.D. Program The doctoral program offers advanced training that prepares students for research and teaching positions. Graduates also may be particularly qualified for positions with private or governmental agencies where they can bring advanced aca\u00ad demic training, insight, and expertise to bear in such areas as environmental quality, environmental design research and urban planning, criminal justice, community health, func\u00ad tional and dysfunctional social development, and program evaluation. Students who enter with the normal academic preparation and pursue a full-time program of study ordinar\u00ad ily should be able to earn the Ph.D. degree in five years of study beyond the baccalaureate. Each incoming Ph.D. student will be assigned a faculty ad\u00ad visor with whom the student should meet at least once every quarter to discuss an individualized program of graduate edu\u00ad cation. Required for all Ph.D. students are: Seminar in Social Ecology (200), Research Methods (201), two approved quar\u00ad ters of graduate-level statistics, and either Program Evalua\u00ad tion (291), Social Epidemiology (224), or Strategies of Theory Development (261). In addition to these five required core courses, doctoral stu\u00ad dents must also complete a minimum of six other approved graduate level courses before advancement to candidacy. These six additional required courses are exclusive of any field study, directed study, independent study, or dissertation research courses (297, 298, 299, or 296). Students may take each of their electives within a different substantive area or may take clusters of courses within fewer subareas. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 254 Social Ecology All Ph.D. students who have not been advanced to candidacy will be formally evaluated by the Social Ecology faculty at the end of each year. At that time, the faculty may recommend that the student continue toward the Ph.D., complete the M.A. degree only, or cease graduate studies in the Program. Evaluation of Ph.D. students advanced to candidacy is the responsibility of the student's doctoral dissertation commit\u00ad tee. Prior to the award of the Ph.D., each doctoral student must serve as a Teaching Assistant under faculty supervision for at least two quarters. All Ph.D. students are required to complete a research project before advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The method of research may include experiments, questionnaire and sur\u00ad vey studies, systematic field observation, computer simula\u00ad tion, etc. It is expected that students will begin this project during their first year in residence and that it will be com\u00ad pleted during the second year. The written report of the project may be equivalent to a Master's thesis and may be submitted as such if the student has been advanced to candi\u00ad dacy for the M.A. degree. Also, before being officially advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D., doctoral students must demonstrate mastery of one or more research areas within Social Ecology. Accordingly, stu\u00ad dents are required to submit a written analysis of a social/en\u00ad vironmental problem relevant to one or more disciplines within Social Ecology. The breadth requirement can be com\u00ad pleted through alternative written formats including a com\u00ad prehensive examination or the submission of a manuscript (or series of papers) which intensively examines specific research issues. Preferably, the perspective taken should be interdisciplinary, but a unidisciplinary approach is acceptable if it is more congruent with the student's educational goals and is acceptable to the student's committee. Each student's plans for completing the breadth requirement are developed in collaboration with a committee of three Social Ecology faculty members. Students are encouraged to assemble and meet with this committee as early as possible during their graduate career and are required to do so by no later than the third quarter of their second year. Once the student's plans have been approved and implemented, the examining com\u00ad mittee will meet with the individual to determine his or her success in meeting the breadth requirement, and to recom\u00ad mend additional academic work if it is deemed necessary. A student may be formally advanced to candidacy for the Ph.D. when all the requirements except the dissertation have been completed, and when the student's dissertation plan has been approved by the candidacy committee appointed by the Dean of Graduate Studies on behalf of the Graduate Council. The student will appear before this committee for an oral examination. The dissertation plan will include a thorough examination of the history of the problem being proposed for investigation; its current status; the way in which the pro\u00ad posed research will further knowledge; a detailed specifica\u00ad tion of the proposed method of approach to the problem; and a description of the planned methods for analyzing research findings.

Sirignano Dean The School of Engineering is comprised of three Depart\u00ad ments: Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. Each Department offers undergraduate and graduate degree pro\u00ad grams of study for individuals who will engage in the profes\u00ad sional practice of engineering as it relates to design, develop\u00ad ment, research, other engineering functions, and teaching in industry, government, or a university. Programs at all levels emphasize the fundamentals underlying engineering, enabling the graduates to continue professional development through formal or informal study. The degree programs in the School of Engineering endeavor to provide UCI graduates with adequate intellectual tools for entrance into the profes\u00ad sion and for continued renewal of their technical knowledge. At the undergraduate level, a Bachelor of Science degree pro\u00ad gram in Engineering, with options in Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering, is offered respectively through the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments. Each of these options is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology. Courses in aerospace engineering are offered within the Mechanical Engineering option. Courses in computer engi\u00ad neering are offered within the Electrical Engineering option. Courses in computer science are offered external to the School of Engineering by the Department of Information and Computer Science (ICS). Students with high achievement may declare a double major in Engineering and ICS. Early consultation with the School is advisable on this and other double-major programs, such as the one with Biological Sciences. The undergraduate Engineering curriculum provides a firm background in the basic sciences through courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry; a fundamental understanding of the engineering sciences through required basic engineering courses; and specialization via technical electives. The breadth requirement must be taken in the areas of Humanistic Inquiry, Social and Behavioral Sciences, and Writing. It is not uncommon for engineering students to need more than four years to obtain their B.S. degree, particularly if part\u00ad time employment or major extracurricular activities make heavy demands on their time. Occasionally students can catch up by enrolling in summer sessions at UCI or at other institutions when a petition has been approved in advance. Each of the three Departments offers graduate-level options leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The M.S. program requires 36 units to be completed; the exact selection of the courses is formulated through consultation between the student and a faculty advisor. Thesis and non\u00ad thesis programs are available. The Ph.D. program is less structured but more specialized than at the M.S. level. There is no set course requirement; rather, students must demon\u00ad strate various competencies as they progress toward the completion of their doctoral programs. Engineering students may join any of a number of student organizations. Most of these organizations are professionally oriented and in many instances are local chapters of national engineering societies. A primary function of these groups is to provide regular technical and social meetings for students with common interests. Most of them also participate in the annual Engineering Week activities, held each February, and in other School functions. There are student chapters of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA), the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE), the American Society of Mechani\u00ad cal Engineers (ASME), the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), the Mexican-American Engineering Society (MAES), the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE), the Society of Women Engineers (SWE), and the honorary engineering societies Tau Beta Pi, Eta Kappa Nu, and Zeta Omicron Tau. Faculty and committee meetings (except those involving per\u00ad sonnel considerations) are open meetings; in addition to designated student representatives, all students are encour\u00ad aged and expected to participate in the development of School policy. Student evaluation of the quality of instruction for each course is requested each quarter. Focused Research Programs The Focused Research Program on Image Engineering is a multidisciplinary activity synthesizing current research on technologies which utilize visual images. For more informa\u00ad tion, see page 274. The Focused Research Program in Combustion Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary activity addressing both fundamental and applied research in combustion. The pro\u00ad gram is described in greater detail on page 278. Degrees Engineering ............................ B.S., M.S., Ph.D. Honors Undergraduate honors at graduation in the School of Engi\u00ad neering are awarded on the basis of grade point average, ser\u00ad vice to the School, service to the University, service to the community, or achievement in research projects. A general criterion is that students must have completed at least 72 units in residence at a University of California campus. Approximately 1 percent of the graduating class shall be awarded summa cum laude, 3 percent magna cum laude, and 8 percent cum laude, with no more than 12 percent being awarded honors. Additional awards in other categories are made throughout the academic year. Undergraduate Program NOTE: The undergraduate program leads to a B.S. degree in Engineering, with accredited options in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering. Admissions Students should plan to enter the Engineering program at UCI only as freshmen or as juniors. The sequential nature of the Engineering program and the fact that many courses are offered only once a year also make it imperative that students begin their studies in the fall quarter. Applicants wishing to be admitted for the fall quarter, 1988 must have submitted their completed application forms by November 30, 1987. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Engineering 265 Human-powered flight is the topic of a senior project in Mechanical Engineering. The School of b:gineering has three departments: Cit>il, Electriml, m11i Mecha11iml Engineering. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 266 Engineering High school students wishing to enter the UCI Engineering program are advised to have completed four years of English, four years of mathematics, and one year each of physics and chemistry. That preparation, along with honors courses and advanced placement courses, is fundamental to success in the Engineering program and is vital to receiving first considera\u00ad tion for admittance to the Engineering major during periods of restricted enrollments. Special attention will also be given to applicants who have submitted their SAT scores and three Achievement Test Scores by January 2, 1988. All applicants for the School of Engineering must apply for admission to a specific Engineering department. These departments are Civil Engineering (CE), Electrical Engineering (EE), and Mechanical Engineering (ME). If enrollment limitations make it necessary, unaccommodated Engineering applicants may be offered alternative majors at UCI. A student may be admitted to a program (i.e., Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engineering) in the School of Engineering either from another major at UCI or from another college or university, including a community college. A student seeking admission to the School of Engineering from colleges and schools other than UCI must satisfy the University :-equire\u00ad ments for admission to advanced standing and must have completed the appropriate prerequisites for the junior-level courses to be undertaken in the School. Since the require\u00ad ments vary from program to program, those contemplating admission in advanced standing to the School should consult the Office of Undergraduate Student Affairs, 204 Engineer\u00ad ing Building, (714) 856-6749, for the specific requirements of each program. Transfer students satisfying the Statewide Articulation Agreement on Lower-Division Engineering Requirements (California Community Colleges-California State Universi\u00ad ties-University of California) may complete the remaining requirements for the B.S. degree in six quarters at UCI, pro\u00ad vided one or two designated courses are taken in summer session prior to entry. All transfer students should arrange for early consultation with the School's Undergraduate Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office so that a smooth transition can be planned. Advising Academic advising is available from faculty advisors, aca\u00ad demic counselors, and peer advisors. Freshmen and sopho\u00ad mores will find that most of their questions can be answered by the counselors and by the peer advisors in the School's Office of Undergraduate Student Affairs. All Engineering students must consult at least once every year with the aca\u00ad demic counselors in the School's Undergraduate Student Affairs Office. Students also are encouraged to consult with their faculty advisors. Mechanical Engineering and Civil Engineering students are required to meet with their faculty advisor at least once each year and whenever they desire to change their program of study. Career Advising Career information and job opportunities are available through the UCI Career Planning and Placement Center. Workshops on resume preparation, job search, and interview techniques are available. A career planning course, Mathe\u00ad matics 71, is available. Special career planning events are held throughout the year including an annual Career Fair. Indi\u00ad vidual career counseling is available, and students have access to the Career Library which contains information on gradu\u00ad ate and professional schools in engineering, as well as general career information. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree University Requirements: See pages 48-50. School Requirements: Credit for at least 180 units including the following: Mathematics Courses: Twenty-four units-Mathematics in (a) Humanistic Inquiry, (b) Social and Behavioral Sciences, and (c) Writing. Technology-oriented courses are not accepted for this requirement. At least one writing course, such as Engineering 190W, must be taken at the upper-division level. See pages 13-14 for the list of other approved courses. Note that the remaining breadth require\u00ad ments therein stated are satisfied by the courses in Mathe\u00ad matics and Basic Sciences specified above. Breadth courses must include at least two lower-division courses in writing beyond the Subject A requirement and one upper-division course in writing. Departmental Requirements: Departmental requirements for civil, electrical, and mechanical engineering options are de\u00ad scribed within each Department's section; see pages 269, 273, and 278, respectively. Free Electives: Free electives include any academic course taken in addition to the degree requirements in order to meet the 180 unit graduation requirement. Duplication of Subject Material: Students who take courses which involve considerable duplication of subject material may not receive full graduation credit for all units thus completed. Residence Requirement: In addition to the University resi\u00ad dence requirement, at least 36 upper-division engineering units specified by each option must be completed successfully at the University of California. Variations: Variations from the general School degree requirements may be made subject to the approval of the faculty of the School. Students wishing to obtain variances should submit petitions to the School's Undergraduate Stu\u00ad dent Affairs Office. Programs of Study A student who wishes to graduate from one of the accredited department options-Civil, Electrical, or Mechanical Engi\u00ad neering-should select the engineering and basic science courses listed in the respective program of study. Additional information on opportunities within each option is available from faculty advisors and academic counselors, who will also advise students on selection of courses. Students must realize, however, that ultimately they alone are responsible for the planning of their own programs and for satisfactory completion of the grad\u00ad uation requirements. Mechanical and Civil engineering stu\u00ad dents are required to have their program of study approved by their faculty advisor at least once each year and whenever they desire to change their program of study. Students may substitute courses of their choosing for those required if they can substantiate the merits of the program of study and obtain prior approval from faculty of the School. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Students are cautioned about the structure of prerequisites which underlies most Engineering courses. The sample pro\u00ad grams shown in each departmental description constitute preferred sequences which take into account all prerequisites. Students must complete all of the required lower-division courses in the freshman and sophomore years in order to qualify for enrollment in any upper-division Engineering course. School of Engineering policy does not permit the addition or deletion of courses after the third week of the quarter. Indi\u00ad vidual instructors may have more stringent add/drop policies; students should request a statement of the instructor's policy at the beginning of each quarter's class. Qualified undergraduate students who have high academic standing, who have completed the necessary prerequisites, and who have obtained permission from the School's Under\u00ad graduate Study Committee may take certain graduate-level courses. Students are required to complete Engineering 10 during the freshman year and English and Comparative Literature WR39A-B during the first two years. Thereafter, proficiency in writing and computing (using a higher-level language which must include BASIC and FORTRAN) is expected in all Engineering courses. Students in the School of Engineering, in accordance with general campus policy, are permitted to take courses in cer\u00ad tain areas on a Pass/Not Pass basis. With respect to programs in Engineering, such areas are the breadth courses, except for courses taken in fulfillment of the UCI writing requirement; any free electives; and any courses not submitted as fulfilling the graduation requirement (including technical electives beyond the number required). Proficiency Examinations A student may take a course by examination with the ap\u00ad proval of the faculty member in charge of the course and the Dean of the School. Normally, ability will be demonstrated by a written or oral examination; if a portion of the capability involves laboratory exercises, the student may be required to perform experiments as well as to take a written examina\u00ad tion. The proficiency examination is not available for any course a student has taken before at UCI. Undergraduate Acceleration toward the M.S. Degree in Engineering Exceptionally promising seniors may, with permission of the Undergraduate Study Committee, take graduate-level Engi\u00ad neering courses in addition to the undergraduate degree requirements. After attaining the B.S. degree and upon acceptance to the M.S. program in Engineering, the student may petition for application of up to eight units of excess credit toward the M.S. degree. If the petition is approved by the School and the Dean of Graduate Studies, the student could complete the M.S. degree in three quarters of residence as a graduate student even while serving as a teaching or research assistant. Graduate Program Graduate study is offered le~ding to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Engineering. The graduate program has concen\u00ad trations in Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. Civil Engineering focuses upon four major thrust areas: structural mechanics and engineering; earthquake engineering; trans-Engineering 267 portation planning and urban systems; and water resources. The concentration in Electrical Engineering includes the three major thrust areas of computer engineering, optical and solid state devices, and systems and signal processing. The thrust areas in Mechanical Engineering include the thermal and fluid sciences, combustion and propulsion, control sys\u00ad tems, robotics, materials, and aerospace engineering. Studies in operations research can be carried out through interdisci\u00ad plinary courses offered by several academic units. Admissions For information on requirements for admission to graduate study at UCI, see page 73. Admission to graduate standing in the School of Engineering is generally accorded those pos\u00ad sessing a B.S. degree in engineering or an allied field obtained with an acceptable level of scholarship from an institution of recognized standing. Those seeking admission without the prerequisite scholarship record may, in some cases, undertake remedial work; if completed at the stipulated academic level, they will be admitted to full graduate standing. Those ad\u00ad mitted from an allied field may be required to take supple\u00ad mentary upper-division courses in basic engineering subjects. The Graduate Record Examination General Test is required of all applicants. Master of Science in Engineering The M.S. degree is normally attained by 6ne of two routes: Plan I, a thesis, or Plan II, a comprehensive examination. For the M.S. degree with thesis, a minimum of 36 approved units is required, of which at least 20 must be nonresearch graduate units (courses numbered 200-289). A maximum of eight M.S. thesis research units (296) may be submitted. The M.S. thesis must demonstrate the student's capability of undertaking an original study and carrying it through to a conclusion satisfactory to at least three members of the faculty. For the M.S. degree with comprehensive examination, a min\u00ad imum of 36 approved units are required, of which at least 24 must be nonresearch graduate units (numbered 200-289). In Electrical Engineering the comprehensive examination takes the form of a core course program (see Graduate Courses in Electrical Engineering). In Mechanical Engineering, the com\u00ad prehensive examination includes a research project and a report. The detailed program of study for each M.S. student is formulated in consultation with an advisor who takes into consideration the objectives and preparation of the candidate and the specific requirements of the School. Students should acquaint themselves with core course requirements in the various concentrations of the M.S. program. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. Full\u00ad time students must carry 12 units per quarter and should be able to complete the requirements for the M.S. degree in three to four quarters. M.S. students with theses or projects have to meet depart\u00ad mental research requirements as a research assistant or equiv\u00ad alent, with or without salary. Further details of the M.S. program in the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments are presented in the individual departmental descriptions. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988268 Engineering Part-Time Study Those students who are employed may pursue the M.S. degree on a part-time basis, carrying fewer units per quarter. Since University residence requirements necessitate the suc\u00ad cessful completion of a minimum number of units in gradu\u00ad ate or upper-division work in each of at least three regular University quarters, the part-time student should seek the advice of the graduate student counselor in the School of Engineering and the approval of the chair of the appropriate program (CE, EE, or ME). M.S. programs must be completed in four calendar years from the date of admission. Students taking courses in University Extension should consult the section on Transfer of Courses below. Transfer of Courses Upon petition, a limited number of graduate-level courses taken through University Extension, on another campus of the University, or in another accredited university may be credited toward the M.S. degree after admission. With the exception of work undertaken in another Graduate Division of the University, transfer credit will not be applied to the minimum required units in ZOO-series courses. For further information, see page 77. Doctor of Philosophy in Engineering The doctoral program is tailored to the individual needs and background of the student. The detailed program of study for each Ph.D. student is formulated in consultation with an advisory committee which takes into consideration the objec\u00ad tives and preparation of the candidate. The program of study must be approved by the faculty of the School. There are no specific course requirements, but there are sev\u00ad eral milestones to be passed: admission to the Ph.D. program by the faculty of the School; within one year of arrival on the campus, passage of a preliminary examination or similar assessment of the student's background and potential for success in the doctoral program; meeting departmental teach\u00ad ing requirements, which can be satisfied through service as a teaching assistant or equivalent; research preparation; formal advancement to candidacy through qualifying examination conducted on behalf of the Irvine division of the Academic Senate; completion of a significant research investigation; and completion and defense of an acceptable dissertation. There is no foreign language requirement. Ph.D. students have to meet departmental research requirements as a research assistant or equivalent, with or without salary. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the Doctoral Commit\u00ad tee and the Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. For at least the final two years of the doctoral program it is expected that the student will be a full-time resident in the School. Doctoral programs must be completed in seven calendar years from the date of admission. Financial aid, such as research and teaching assistantships, is available. Further details of the Ph.D. program in the Civil, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering Departments are presented in the individual departmental descriptions.

The success of this endeavor is evident all around us. The inhospitable arid plain which greeted the early settlers in Southern California has been transformed into a thriving metropolis largely resulting from the application of civil engineering. The object of the Civil Engineering curriculum is to prepare graduates for a career in practice, research, or teaching. At the undergraduate level a common core of fundamental sub\u00ad jects is provided, with opportunity to specialize in the senior year. Graduate opportunities allow programs of study in structural analysis and design, transportation and urban sys\u00ad tems, and water resources engineering. The career opportunities in civil engineering are certainly as varied as in any other discipline. Graduates may look forward to long-term careers in major corporations, public bodies, the military, private consulting firms, or to being self-employed in private practice. History has shown a civil engineering education to be a good grounding for many administrative and managerial positions.

Electrical engineering is a broad field encompassing such diverse subject areas as computers, control, electronics, dig\u00ad ital systems, communications, signal processing, electromag\u00ad netics, and physics of electronic devices. Knowledge of the mathematical and natural sciences is 'applied to the theory, design, and implementation of devices and systems for the benefit of society. Some electrical engineers focus on the study of behavior of electronic devices and circuits that are the basic building blocks of complex electronic systems. Others study the gen\u00ad eration, transmission, and utilization of electrical energy. A large group of electrical engineers studies the behavior of complex electronic systems such as computers, automatic controls, telecommunications, and signal processing. Still another group studies the application of these complex sys\u00ad tems to other areas, including medicine, biology, geology, and ecology. Of this latter group, those engaged in designing a variety of electronic computers and computer-based applica\u00ad tion systems are often called computer engineers. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988274 Engineering Most electrical engineers begin work in a large organizational environment as members of an engineering team. They obtain career satisfaction from solving meaningful problems that contribute to the success of the organization's overall goal. As they mature, electrical engineers have the opportun\u00ad ity to grow technically, administratively, or both. Technical growth most naturally results from the acquisition of an advanced degree and further development of the basic thought processes instilled in the undergraduate years. Administrative growth can result from the development of management skills on the job and/or through advanced degree programs in management. In either case, a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering provides a solid foundation for future career growth. Focused Research Program on Image Engineering Spanning the growing industrial-scientific spectrum of tech\u00ad nologies which utilize visual images, image engineering syn\u00ad thesizes current research in a comprehensive way that may have far-reaching effects on fields such as manufacturing, fluid mechanics, structural vibrations, chemistry, cardiology, and radiology. This new concept in engineering could impact a range of industries from radar to pharmaceuticals, from medical imaging to computer-aided manufacturing, from vehicular guidance and inspection to electronic cameras. Pro\u00ad gram participants include engineering firms and several aca\u00ad demic disciplines at UCI. Further information is available from Professor Jack Sklansky, Director of the Focused Research Program in Image Engineering, Department of Electrical Engineering, School of Engineering, University of California, Irvine, CA 92717. Undergraduate Option in Electrical Engineering Bachelor of Science Degree The undergraduate Electrical Engineering curriculum is built around a basic core of humanities, mathematics, natural and engineering science courses. It is arranged to provide the fundamentals of synthesis and design that will enable gradu\u00ad ates to begin careers in industry or to go on to graduate study. Electrical engineering students at UCI are exposed to courses in network analysis, electronic system design, signal processing, control systems, electromagnetics, and com\u00ad puters. They learn to design circuits and systems to meet specific needs and to use modern computers in problem anal\u00ad ysis and solution. A major program emphasis within the Department is com\u00ad puter engineering, a discipline primarily concerned with design and analysis of computer systems.

The thesis option is available for those graduate students who might best benefit from intense concentration on a spe\u00ad cific problem. For the thesis option, students (during the first quarter of the program and in consultation with their faculty advisor) are required to develop and obtain approval of a complete program of study. A committee of three full-time faculty members is appointed to guide development of the thesis and, when the thesis is approved, to administer an oral examination on basic principles and the thesis contents. It is possible to meet either degree requirement on a part-time basis. Doctor of Philosophy Degree The Ph.D. program in Electrical Engineering requires a com\u00ad mitment on the part of the student to dedicated study and collaboration with the faculty. Ph.D. students are selected on the basis of outstanding demonstrated potential and scholar\u00ad ship. Applicants must hold the appropriate prerequisite degrees from recognized institutions of high standing. After substantial preparation, Ph.D. candidates work as under\u00ad studies to faculty advisors. The process involves extended immersion in a research atmosphere and culminates in the production of original research results presented in a dissertation. Milestones to be passed in the Ph.D. program include the fol\u00ad lowing: acceptance into a research group by the faculty ad\u00ad visor during the student's first quarter of study; passing the Preliminary Examination (a screening examination to let stu\u00ad dents know at an early stage whether the faculty perceives they are likely to successfully complete the degree); prepara\u00ad tion for doing research, completion of the School of Engi\u00ad neering teaching requirements, and the development of a research proposal; passing the Qualifying Examination which assesses the candidate's preparation for research and evalu\u00ad ates the proposed research; successful completion of the research; development and approval of the dissertation; pre\u00ad sentation of the dissertation and final examination on its contents. The degree is granted upon the recommendation of the doc\u00ad toral committee and the School's Associate Dean of Graduate Studies and Research. Doctoral programs must be completed within seven calendar years of the date of admission. Electrical Engineering Undergraduate Courses EE72 Electronics and Power Systems (3) S.

Russell Roberts, Ph.D. Catholic University of America, Lecturer in Mechanical Engineering (numerical analysis, probability and sta\u00ad tistics, turbulence) Mechanical engineering is concerned with energy conversion and transfer, forces and motions, and material behavior in the design of systems. Knowledge of mathematics, physics, and chemistry lies at the core of the field, but application of this knowledge to design uses engineering technology-a dis\u00ad ciplined way of thinking, modeling, and testing that enables design to proceed despite incomplete information and uncertainty. Two areas of specialization are available within the under\u00ad graduate option in Mechanical Engineering: the traditional mechanical engineering curriculum and aerospace engineer\u00ad ing. Both areas include statics, kinematics, dynamics, fluid mechanics, heat and mass transfer, thermodynamics, solid mechanics, mechanical behavior of materials, controls, and experimental methods. Application areas include combustion, heat engines, propulsion, refrigeration, robotics, terrestrial and aerospace vehicles. Since mechanical engineering covers a wide spectrum of sub-' jects, many students use the undergraduate curriculum as preparation for further studies in areas such as environmen\u00ad tal engineering, medicine, law, and management. Focused Research Program in Combustion Science and Technology The Focused Research Program in Combustion Science and Technology is a multidisciplinary activity addressing both fundamental and applied research in combustion. Participants include faculty from the Department of Mechanical Engineer\u00ad ing, the Department of Chemistry in the School of Physical Sciences, and the Department of Community and Environ\u00ad mental Medicine in the College of Medicine. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988The program's purposes include (I) development of a more complete understanding of the processes of combustion, with particular emphasis on turbulent transport, spray combus\u00ad tion, laser diagnostics, and chemistry-turbulence interaction, (2) determination of the relationships between the physio\u00ad chemical processes of combustion and potential health effects of environmental emissions, and (3) development of applica\u00ad tions of technological importance. The focus of the program is directed to laser diagnostics (velocity, temperature, species concentration, droplet size, droplet velocity, and soot particulates); numerical methods (direct simulation; mass, heat, and momentum transport; spray processes); and applications (turbulent transport, spray combustion, chemical kinetics, chemistry-turbulence interac\u00ad tion, and health effects). Further information about the program is available from Pro\u00ad fessor G.S. Samuelsen, Director of the Focused Research Program in Combustion Science and Technology, Depart\u00ad ment of Mechanical Engineering, School of Engineering, Uni\u00ad versity of California, Irvine, California 92717. Undergraduate Option in Mechanical Engineering Bachelor of Science Degree The undergraduate mechanical engineering curriculum includes a core of mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Elec\u00ad tives in the humanities are required for intellectual develop\u00ad ment. Engineering courses in fundamental areas fill much of the remaining curriculum; a few electives allow the under\u00ad graduate student to specialize somewhat or to pursue broader areas. Requirements for the Bachelor's Degree with the Mechanical Engineering Option University Requirements: See pages 4S-50. School Requirements: See page 266.

The faculty advisors and the Undergraduate Student Affairs Office can provide necessary guidance for satisfying the design requirements. Selection of elective courses must be approved by the assigned faculty advisor and the departmen\u00ad tal undergraduate advisor. Program of Study The sample program of study chart is typical for the accred\u00ad ited option in Mechanical Engineering. The chart shows sam\u00ad ples of coordinated sets of technical electives by area of spe\u00ad cialization. Students should keep in mind that this program is based upon a rigid set of prerequisites, beginning with ade\u00ad quate preparation in high school mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Therefore, the course sequence should not be changed except for the most compelling reasons. Students who. are not adequately prepared, or who wish to make changes in the sequence for other reasons, must have their programs approved by their faculty advisor. Graduate Concentration in Mechanical Engineering Master of Science Degree Two options are available to pursue study for the M.S. degree.

Each student in the Mas\u00ad ter's program focuses upon an institutional area and may develop expertise in one or more functional specializations. The Ph.D. program for the field of administration has aca\u00ad demic and research objectives. General Admission Requirements Evaluation of the applicant's file for admission to the Mas\u00ad ter's and Ph.D. degree programs will consist of an integrated assessment of all materials (test scores, transcripts of pre\u00ad vious academic work, statements of purpose, and letters of recommendation). The University admission standard of a 3.0 or better undergraduate grade point average (on a 4.0 scale) is required. The minimum TOEFL (Test of English as a For\u00ad eign Language) score acceptable for study at GSM is 570. Requests for application material should be addressed to the Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine; Irvine, California 92717.

Educational Objectives Three basic premises underlie the School's philosophy of graduate education. First, there are significant phenomena and problems common to business, educational, and govern-mental organizations; second, a common set of disciplines, concepts, techniques, and technologies exist which are appropriate to a wide range of organizational or scholarly roles; third, many administrators in the future will work in more than one of the three arenas during their careers. Regardless of the content of particular courses, it is expected that all degree candidates will be exposed to and have the ability to use the following: General Knowledge. The broad context of organizations and management; the late twentieth century (significant trends, conditions, and problems); history of science, scientific inquiry, and the philosophy of science; economic, political, and social analysis. Conceptual and Empirical Knowledge of Organizations. Basic concepts of management; the structure and functions of organizations, including comparative analysis and inter\u00ad organizational relations; levels and units of decision making; individual behavior and group norms; operating environ\u00ad ments of organizations. Specific Knowledge of Particular Arenas of Administration. In-depth study of specific institutional environments for administrative practice, such as governmental and business organizations, and other types of organizations. Mathematics and Statistics. As tools of precise reasoning, as languages which will tend more and more to dominate pro\u00ad fessional and scholarly literature, and above all, as founda\u00ad tions for relevant quantitative methods. Technical Bases of Management. Decision processes; opera\u00ad tions research; systems and policy analysis; budgeting and accounting techniques; personnel policies; techniques for measuring and affecting attitudes and behavior; research design and strategies. Management Information Systems. Computer technology, information sciences, and basic computer applications. General Skills.

Recognition of the administrator's potential contributions to society and of ethical and moral problems which arise from social research and the management of human enterprises. Undergraduate Minor in Management The GSM faculty and the Dean of Undergraduate Studies offer an undergraduate minor in Management. The minor consists of seven courses: one lower-division introductory course and six upper-division courses. Students are eligible to apply for the minor in Management if they have completed all prerequisite courses (including Man\u00ad agement 5) with a grade no lower than C (2.0) and have upper-division standing. Admission to the minor requires students to submit an application, transcripts, and a state\u00ad ment of purpose. The deadline for completion of the applica\u00ad tion is May 1. Interested students may obtain further infor\u00ad mation from the GSM Office, 322 Social Science Tower. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988In establishing the GSM undergraduate minor in Manage\u00ad ment, the faculty anticipated three types of students to be drawn to courses in administration: (1) students who wish to learn about the administration of organizations as a way of gaining appreciation for a significant aspect of the culture, (2) students preparing for careers in other fields that require some knowledge of administration but not a high concentra\u00ad tion in the field, and (3) students who expect to go on to graduate work in administration and who wish early guid\u00ad ance and undergraduate work appropriate to this career objective. Prerequisite Courses The following are prerequisite for enrolling in the upper\u00ad division undergraduate minor courses: Management 5; Social Sciences 12A and 12C; Mathematics 2A; one from either Mathematics 7, Mathematics 131 A-B-C, Social Sciences llA\u00ad B-C, Social Sciences 100A-B-C, or the equivalent; and a one\u00ad quarter course selected from Social Sciences 6A, 6B, 6C, 7, 8, or Social Ecology 59. Transfer students should check with their college counselor for established equivalencies for these prerequisite courses. Courses Satisfying the Undergraduate Minor Management 5, 181, 183, 160, 185, 186, and 187. The 3-2 Program for Undergraduates In addition to the two-year Master's program for students who have already received a bachelor's degree from the Uni\u00ad versity of California or another institution, outstanding UCI undergraduate students may enter a cooperative 3-2 Pro\u00ad gram with GSM and most other campus units. Acceptance into the 3-2 Program constitutes advance admission to the graduate program. Such students complete their undergrad\u00ad uate major requirements by the end of the junior year. Dur\u00ad ing their senior year, they take graduate courses in GSM. These courses are used to satisfy their undergraduate unit requirements, and at the same time apply toward their grad\u00ad uate degrees. Successful completion of the requirements in the program normally leads to the bachelor's degree in the cooperating discipline after the fourth year, and an M.B.A. degree after the fifth year. The ability to complete both degrees in five years may vary by academic program. Stu\u00ad dents should consult with their academic counselor in their major School for further information about completing undergraduate requirements in three years. Students con\u00ad templating entering such a program should contact the Graduate School of Management prior to, or early in, the start of the junior year, for the purpose of program consultation. NOTE: With the exception of 3-2 students, no undergradu\u00ad ates will be enrolled in GSM graduate-level courses. Master's Degree Programs The Graduate School of Management offers the M.B.A. (Master of Business Administration) degree which requires a minimum of 23 quarter courses (92 units) with a minimum overall grade point average of 3.0 in the Core and overall. The Master's degree program normally takes two full aca\u00ad demic years or their equivalent in part-time registration. Students with substantial personal or professional commit\u00ad ments take two courses per quarter and are required to com\u00ad plete the Master's degree in no more than four years. To accommodate the needs of these students, GSM offers a number of courses each quarter during the late afternoon and evening hours (beginning at 4:00 p.m.). There is no the\u00ad sis required. The courses in the Master's degree program are Management 287 divided into two groups, each group designed to achieve spe\u00ad cific educational objectives. The courses are divided as fol\u00ad lows: 14 required Common Core Courses and nine elective courses which students select to emphasize career goals and educational interests. Common Core Courses Common Core Courses, each of which is four units, are: Management of Complex Organizations, Statistics for Man\u00ad agement, Operations Research for Management, Organiza\u00ad tional Analysis for Management, Financial and Managerial Accounting for Management, Microeconomics for Manage\u00ad ment, Macroeconomics for Management, Government and Public Policy, Computer and Information Systems for Man\u00ad agement, Business Strategy, Marketing for Management, Corporate Finance, Operations Management. Elective Courses The remaining coursework for the Master's degrees will con\u00ad sist of nine electives for the M.B.A. The major emphasis in the elective courses will be to develop additional depth in a discipline or interdisciplinary area or specialized competence in the use of a particular set of technical tools and methods. The student will select the electives in light of the student's educational and career goals and interests. Executive M.B.A. Program The Executive M.B.A. Program is designed for managers who are highly motivated toward a career in management of organizations and for those currently in executive positions. It enables participants to enhance their management skills while obtaining a high-quality advanced education. Students may continue in their full-time professional roles while enrolled in the program. Limited class sizes are maintained, and all participants gain extensive work and managerial experience. The program consists of a 92-unit course of study completed on alternating Fridays and Saturdays, with three five-day residential sessions held during the 21-month sequence. Emphasis is placed on organizational and interpersonal skills; increased competence in specific management techniques; overall management training; and developing an understand\u00ad ing of the integration of business and the environment. Further information may be obtained by contacting the Director, Executive M.B.A. Program, Graduate School of Manag~ment, University of California, Irvine, California 92717. Management Internship Program To complement the academic curriculum of GSM, a Man\u00ad agement Internship Program provides practical application and work experience to selected GSM Master's students. Student interns are employed in administrative positions by local organizations. Course credit is available for participants in the Internship Program through the course \"Management Internship Seminar.\" GSM faculty and organizational repre\u00ad sentatives as well as student interns participate in this seminar which deals with specific topics and projects encoun\u00ad tered by the interns in their positions. Special Opportunities Opportunities for students to take part in ongoing research exist through two University-wide research units based on the Irvine campus. Through the Public Policy Research Organization (PPRO) a student may participate in research on significant public policy issues. Current projects include a nationwide study of local government information systems. The Institute of Transportation Studies (ITS) conducts UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 288 Management research in the areas of urban transportation policy and planning, transit management and labor relations, and trans\u00ad portation system evaluation. Students interested in these areas may have an opportunity to work on an ITS project. Placement Services The GSM Placement Office, located within the School, was established by UCI's Career Planning and Placement Center in order to serve the unique placement needs of M.B.A. stu\u00ad dents and alumni. It has two main functions: (1) attracting a variety of organizations to interview and hire graduates and (2) counseling students in career opportunities and the tech\u00ad niques necessary to conduct effective job searches, not only for their first jobs but throughout their careers. The rela\u00ad tively small size of the M.B.A. program allows considerable interaction between the Placement Office and students. Doctor of Philosophy in Administration GSM offers the Ph.D. in Administration to students with backgrounds in a variety of disciplines. While a master's degree is preferred, students may be admitted to the doctoral program directly from the baccalaureate degree. There are many appropriate undergraduate majors, including (but not limited to) psychology, political science, business or public administration, mathematics, computer sciences, economics, sociology, and so forth. Students with academic strengths in disciplines not usually considered as precursors for manage\u00ad ment (e.g., natural sciences, humanities, and the arts) are encouraged to apply. The Ph.D. program is designed to pre\u00ad pare students for academic careers in a number of the fields of management, e.g., organizational behavior, operations research, marketing, public policy, finance, business policy, or management information systems. Requirements of the Ph.D. program include a broad knowledge of core disciplines as represented by the 10 common core courses of the Mas\u00ad ter's degree program. In addition, the Ph.D. student must qualify as a skilled researcher and must complete a disserta\u00ad tion demonstrating these skills. There are no foreign lan\u00ad guage requirements in the GSM Ph.D. program. Although there is considerable variation in the length of time beyond a Master's degree needed to complete the Ph.D., a realistic range is three to five years. The Ph.D. program is divided into three phases: preliminary, qualification, and dissertation. In the qualification phase the student prepares for disserta\u00ad tion research in an area of specialization. This phase is com\u00ad pleted when an oral qualifying examination is passed and the candidacy committee recommends advancement to candidacy for the Ph.D. The dissertation phase involves a significant original research project which demonstrates the Ph.D. student's creativity and ability to launch and sustain a career of research.

The Office offers programs which lead to credentials required by those who teach, counsel, or administer in the public and private schools of California. A second activity of the Office is described below under Project Radius. Faculty associated with the Office of Teacher Education include distinguished scholars, researchers, and authors of national or international reputation. Most faculty have them\u00ad selves taught or served as administrators in public or private schools, and all have shown commitment to the continued improvement of education through the processes of profes\u00ad sional study, the development of new approaches to teaching, and the design or publication of innovative and scholarly courses of study. The Office of Teacher Education is organized around the credential programs it offers. Faculty members generally are associated with the credential programs representing their areas of expertise and interest. The programs provide oppor\u00ad tunities for interaction among students and faculty who share common interests. Project Radius The purpose of Project Radius is to foster a climate of exchange and collegiality among administrators and faculty from UC Irvine and Orange County schools; to address issues, problems, and mutual concerns about curriculum, student preparation, and the professional development of teachers; and to work cooperatively to promote academic excellence at all levels of education. Coordinated by the Office of Teacher Education, Project Radius offers informa\u00ad tion and referral regarding various campus/school outreach activities and resources; conferences, workshops, courses, and summer institutes in specific curricular areas; assistance with curriculum review, design, and implementation; and cooperation with university/school-based fund-raising efforts. Credential Programs The Office of Teacher Education offers programs which lead to California teaching credentials as established by the Teacher Preparation and Licensing Law of 1970, known gen\u00ad erally as the Ryan Act. In addition, programs leading to two nonteaching credentials, the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential and the Administrative Services Credential, are offered. It is possible for a student concurrently to complete the requirements for a credential and to earn a graduate aca\u00ad demic degree. This requires admission to the Teacher Educa\u00ad tion program and the graduate program in which the degree will be sought. There are two basic teaching credentials in California: the Single Subject Credential and the Multiple Subject Creden\u00ad tial. They are called basic because all other teaching and most nonteaching credentials have one of these two credentials as prerequisites. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Teacher Education 293 Student teaching is an integral part of Office of Teacher Education Credential Programs. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 294 Teacher Education Teaching credentials authorized by the 1970 credential law are not determined by grade level (i.e., elementary and secondary) but by the type of instructional situation (multiple or single subject). Each credential carries K-12 authorization. These credentials are awarded by the Commission on Teacher Credentialing upon recommendation of the UCI Office of Teacher Education and are required in order to teach or serve in a professional capacity in any public school in California. Single Subject Instruction Credential \"Single subject instruction\" means the practice of assigning teachers to specified subject matter courses, as is commonly practiced in California high schools and junior high schools. Teachers who are authorized for single subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach any subject in the authorized fields, at any grade level, but normally in a departmentalized secondary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Single Subject Instruction Credentials are auth\u00ad orized by the State of California in art, English, foreign lan\u00ad guages, history, life science, mathematics, music, physical science, social science, as well as agriculture, business, government, health science, home economics, industrial arts, and physical education. Candidates who enroll in the Single Subject Credential pro\u00ad gram at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 101; Education 102A-H (students enroll in the section of their major); Education 105B; Education 105LB; Education 162 (usually taken Education 380. Sample Fifth-Year Program-Single Subject Credential Fall Ed 101 Winter Ed 175* Spring Ed 173* Ed 102 Ed 320A,B Ed 320C,D,E Ed 105B/LB Ed 360 Ed 174 Ed 191L *Students must take either Ed 173 or Ed 175. Multiple Subject Instruction Credential \"Multiple subject instruction\" means the practice of assigning teachers to multiple subject matter instruction, as commonly practiced in California elementary schools. Teachers who are authorized for multiple subject instruction may be assigned, with their consent, to teach in any self-contained classroom: preschool, kindergarten, and grades 1-12 inclusive, but nor\u00ad mally the assignment is in the elementary school. UCI is approved for this credential. Candidates who enroll in the Multiple Subject Credential program at UCI generally are required to take the following courses: Education 105A; Education 105LA; Education llOA\u00ad B-C; Education 162 (usually taken after student teaching); Education 173; Education 174; Education 191L; Education 300A-B-C-D-E; Education 360; Education 380. Sample Fifth-Year Program-Multiple Subject Credential Fall Ed 105A Winter Ed 105LA Spring Ed llOC Ed noB Ed llOA Ed 300C,D,E Ed 173 Ed 191L Ed 174 Ed 300A,B Candidates desiring both Single and Multiple Subject Cre\u00ad dentials may apply the basic professional courses of Educa\u00ad tion 105A, 105LA, 173, 174, 360, 380, and 162 toward both credentials, but must complete Education 101, 102, llOABC, do student teaching in both areas, demonstrate competence by passing appropriate State-mandated subject field examina\u00ad tions where needed, and pass the California Basic Educational Skills Test (CBEST). Intern Teaching Credential Program Through the intern program, a student may earn a stipend for one year of teaching while completing either the Multiple or Single Subject Credential. The stipend is paid by the school district. To serve as an intern in a school district, the student must be enrolled as a postbaccalaureate student in the Office of Teacher Education. Students should plan to interview for the intern program during the winter quarter, and seek admission to the Teacher Education program for the spring quarter to enroll in required courses before beginning their one-year internship. Intern candidates are selected by participating schools and the University based on the back\u00ad ground and experience of the teacher candidate, the needs of the particular school, and the candidate's eligibility for the University's Teacher Education program. The number of internships varies from year to year. For further information see the intern secretary in the Office of Teacher Education. For the Special Education Intern Teaching Credential, see Specialist Credentials. Specialist Credentials The Specialist Credential authorizes teaching in the speciali\u00ad zation area at any grade level from preschool through grade 12. In order to qualify for specialist credentials, the applicant must have a valid basic teaching credential (either the Single Subject or Multiple Subject Credential) and complete a spe\u00ad cialized program of professional preparation in an approved program. The State of California authorizes seven specialist credential categories: early childhood, bilingual/cross-cultural, mathematics, reading, agriculture, health science, and special education. UCI offers preparation for Specialist Credentials in early childhood education and in the special education areas of the learning handicapped, the physically handi\u00ad capped, and the severely handicapped. Students interested in the details about Specialist Credentials should make an appointment for program counseling with the academic ad\u00ad visor in the Office of Teacher Education. Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential. The Early Childhood Education Specialist Credential is a specialization beyond the basic Multiple Subject Instruction Credential. With careful planning, a student can complete the work for a preliminary teaching credential and an Early Childhood Spe\u00ad cialist Credential with the B.A. However, in most cases, stu\u00ad dents obtain both credentials as a result of the fifth-year program. Special Education Specialist Credentials. UCI is approved for three areas of the Special Education Specialist Credential: Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, and Severely Handicapped. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Special Education Intern Specialist Credential. UCI offers an intern teaching credential in each of its three approved areas in special education. The intern teacher becomes a teacher of record if the following requirements can be met: The student must be enrolled in the uq credential program for an entire academic year, and must hold a basic teaching credential. The student must have completed the generic courses required for either the Learning Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, or Severely Handicapped Specialist Credential which includes Education 160, 161, 162, 163, and 184B (equivalency credit may be used for certain of these generic requirements). Finally, the student must have a contract offer from a public school district. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence. The Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence requires pos\u00ad session of a valid Special Education Credential, and three or rriore years of teaching experience, including both regular and special education teaching experience. A clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence authorizes service only if a valid Special Education Credential, other than an emer\u00ad gency credential, is held concurrently. The UCI program lead\u00ad ing to the clear Resource Specialist Certificate of Competence is a 16 quarter-unit program divided into four courses, and followed by an exit assessment. Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis The Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis is a specialization in addition to a regular teaching credential. This means that a candidate must fulfill all the necessary requirements for a basic teaching credential whether this be witl) a Single Sub\u00ad ject orientation for high school or a Multiple Subject orienta\u00ad tion for elementary school. The Irvine program is limited to the development of a bilingual capacity in Spanish only as the second language. At UCI the Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a B.A. with a Bilingualism and English as a Second Language Emphasis. By acquiring this undergraduate major, the stu\u00ad dent will complete a significant part of the specific require\u00ad ments for a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. This is the best kind of preparation for going into the program leading to a Bilingual/Cross-Cultural Emphasis. Entry and exit exam\u00ad inations are required for this program. Services Credential The Ryari Act provides for five categories of nonteaching credentials which authorize their holders to provide specific nonclassroom services to public schools. Services Credentials are issued by the State in pupil personnel services, adminis\u00ad tr<:~tive services, health services, library services, and clinical\u00ad rehabilitative services. UCI offers programs which lead to the Administrative Services Credential, generally required by school administrators, and the Pupil Personnel Services Cre\u00ad dential, sought by school counselors. Both credentials are effective for grades K-12 .. At UCI the Pupil Personnel Ser\u00ad vices Credential requires .a basic teaching credential or a Mas\u00ad ter's degree in Social Ecology. The Administrative Sel'Vices Credential is a two-stage cre\u00ad dential which requires completion of 36 quarter units for a Preliminary Administrative Services Credential and comple\u00ad tion of an additional 36 quarter units for the Professional Administrative Services Credential. Prerequisites for the Pre\u00ad liminary Administrative Services Credential include a basic teaching credential, three years of acceptable full-time teach\u00ad ing experience, completion of Education 162 (or its equiva\u00ad lent), and a passing score on the California Basic Educational Skills Test. Applicants for the Professional Administrative Teacher Education 295 Services Credential are required to have completed three years of administrative services under the preliminary cre\u00ad dential. The Preliminary Credential is valid for five years while the candidate studies for the Professional Credential. Planning a Program of Study Any credential program can be completed with one year of full-time postbaccalaureate study, but it is possible for stu\u00ad dents to pursue a credential in their undergraduate program. All students interested in pursuing a credential should con\u00ad tact an academic counselor in Teacher Education. The Office of Teacher Education program recommends two field experiences prior to entering the program. One such experience might be a tutoring assignmerit.during\u00b7the fresh\u00ad man or sophomore year and another might be serving as a teacher's aide in the junior year. There are numerous options for this field experience. Each field experience program is a cooperative arrangement between the University and the public school districts to help provide UCI students with experience that will prepare them for their future work as teachers.' The field experience can come from any one of sev\u00ad eral academic areas in which students work in public schools under supervision of an experienced teacher in the school and with .a University supervisor. As a tutor, the college student usually works with the public school student on a one-to-one basis. As a teacher's aide, the student typically works for a block of time per week for one quarter with a teacher in the cla_ssroom. During this time, students are given a variety of opportunities to help the experienced teacher enrich the course of study and to participate within the classroom. Ultimately it is in the classroom where the problems of teach\u00ad ing are either solved or ignored; hence here is where teacher preparation begins. This experience will assist the UCI stu\u00ad dent in making a more realistic career choice. It also involves the public school in the selection of future student teachers. Preparation for Admission California law requires that students (1) take the California Basic Ed~cational Skills Test (CBEST) prior to applying for admission to Teacher Education and (2)'successfully complete the National Teacher Examination (NTE) or four-fifths of an approved waiver program prior to beginning their student teaching (normally by the second quarter). Reser~ations to take both examinations must be made well in advance. Students are urged to contact the Office of Teacher Education for information about the tests and test dates six months before they plan to enter the program. Admission to the Teacher Education Program All students are welcome to apply for admission to the Teacher Education program. Students are usually admitted twice a year, in the fall and spring quarters. Information and an application for admission are avail<ible from the Office of Teacher Education, 422 Social Science Tower. Admission is based on a broad index: Academic Achievement. Completion of a baccalaureate degree from an accredited institution and a grade point aver\u00ad age of 3.0 will support consideration of admission to the Teacher Education program at UCI. (Undergraduates who enroll in courses leading to credentials still must be admitted to a fifth year of study-to be described later.) Two official transcripts from each college attended are required. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 296 Teacher Education Absence of Criminal Conviction that Would Preclude the Issuance of a Credential. All students are required by law to obtain a certificate of clearance from the Commission on Teacher Credentialing prior to beginning student teaching. This process is primarily a fingerprint check to determine that the student is clear of criminal conviction. See a coun\u00ad selor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice on how to handle this process. Interview. An Admissions Committee is available to meet with prospective students. All admitted to the program will have a personal interview with a member or members of the Committee. Written Recommendations. Three letters of recommendation for admission are required. Such recommendations should indicate the student's ability to perform graduate-level work. CBEST. Evidence of having taken the California Basic Educa\u00ad tional Skills Test should accompany the application for admission. Admission. Both the UCI academic department correspond\u00ad ing to the student's academic major and the Office of Teacher Education must recommend the admission of applicants for the Single Subject Instruction Credential. The applicant's record is reviewed first by the academic department and then by the Admissions Committee of the Office of Teacher Edu\u00ad cation. Admission is not automatic. Minimum Requirements for the Basic Teaching Credential The minimum requirements for the teaching credential in California are established by California state law. Require\u00ad ments include: 1. A baccalaureate or higher degree, in an area other than professional education, from an approved institution. 2. A fifth-year approved program of professional prepara\u00ad tion. This means a sequence of education courses, includ\u00ad ing an ali-day, full-time assignment of a semester's dura\u00ad tion (or the equivalent) in student teaching. 3. Passage of the National Teacher Exam or its waiver via an approved academic program. UCI academic programs are approved for most examination waivers; but students should seek counsel from Teacher Education to ensure that they are enrolled in an approved waiver program. 4. Under certain conditions the passage of the College Level Examination Program is required. See a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for advice. 5. Demonstration of a knowledge of the various methods of teaching reading as validated by successful completion of a program of study. (Industrial arts, physical education, music, art, and home economics are exempt from this requirement.) 6. A course or an examination covering the U.S. Constitution. 7. A fifth year of study is still required, even though a stu\u00ad dent may elect to start or complete the approved pro\u00ad gram of professional preparation as an undergraduate. 8. Successful completion of the California Basic Educational Skills Test. Applicants are required to take this test prior to application for admission. 9. A grade point average of B or better in all required edu\u00ad cation courses except student teaching or field experience. 10. A grade of B or better in all student teaching or required field experience. The Approved Program of Professional Preparation The \"Approved Program\" refers to the minimum number of education courses required for the teaching credential. UCI defines the approved program as consisting of core courses plus student teaching. Six quarter units of this instruction are required in the teaching of reading. The Office of Teacher Education at UCI also offers a pro\u00ad gram for students who want more than the minimum requirements for teacher preparation. In addition to the min\u00ad imum requirements for a Multiple Subject (elementary) cre\u00ad dential, students are offered a UCI-recommended group of courses that provide candidates with special preparation in writing and critical thinking, mathematics, science, computer applications, and fine arts. (See below.) The UCI-recommended program, which includes the min\u00ad imum requirements and 20 quarter units of special prepara\u00ad tion, can be completed in five quarters, or a sequence of summer, fall, winter, spring, and summer. Passage of a Subject Matter Examination Single Subject Examinations. California requires all students to pass the National Teacher Examination (NTE) in the area of their teaching major prior to student teaching except where particular institutions have developed an approved major which waives the NTE. Students pursuing a waiver option must complete four-fifths of the waiver prior to stu\u00ad dent teaching. All UCJ academic majors which are commonly taught in the public schools have been waived in lieu of the National Teacher Examination. However, in some majors there are certain requirements that a student must complete while fulfilling the major in order to receive this waiver. Stu\u00ad dents should consult a counselor in the Office of Teacher Education for detailed information. Supplementary Authorization. Teaching minors by that name no longer exist, but it is possible to add further teach\u00ad ing authorizations beyond the single subject major. Students deciding to be credentialed in more than one subject area may qualify to do so in either of two ways: 1. Students may complete 30 quarter units (15 units if they are upper-division) in collegiate-level course work to develop a supplementary authorization to teach in areas differing from the single subject major. Consult a coun\u00ad selor in the Office of Teacher Education for details. 2. Students may pass the National Teacher Examination in any area of their choice and thus qualify for the additional authorization in that subject. Multiple Subject Examinations. The National Teacher Exam\u00ad ination General Knowledge section of the Core Battery is a requirement for the multiple subject credential. It includes the following areas: English, fine arts, mathematics, science, and social science. All students must pass the NTE prior to beginning student teaching or must complete at least four\u00ad fifths of a waiver program. The UCI program for the Multi\u00ad ple Subject Teaching Credential is approved for waiver of the examination if the student completes the required diversified program. The examination can be taken as often as necessary but should not be taken prior to the junior year. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988Teacher Education 297 The Office of Teacher Education offers several specialist credentials in addition to the basic single subject and multiple subject instruction credentials. UCI-Recommended Multiple Subject Program Summer Fall Winter Ed 104E (4) Ed 105A (4) Ed 105LA Ed 108 (4) Ed 1108 (3) Ed 110A Ed 118 (4) Ed 173 (4) Ed 191L Ed 309 (4) Ed 174 (1) Ed 300A-B Quarter Units 16 12 Requirements for Waiver of the Multiple Subject National Teacher Examination. Of the student's total undergraduate program, 128 quarter hours are required to be divided as follows: Nine courses (36 quarter units) in two of the following areas and seven courses (28 quarter units) in the other two: a. English (including grammar, literature, advanced com\u00ad position, and speech) b. Social science and history (must have courses in each) c. Mathematics and science (must have courses in each with a minimum of three approved courses in mathematics) d. Fine arts, foreign language, and philosophy Since the academic major on the UCI campus will normally fulfill one of the four areas above and the UCI breadth requirement applies to the others, meeting the four require\u00ad ments is possible if planned early in the student's career. Fifth-Year Requirement The UCI Teacher Education program defines the fifth year as 45 quarter units of upper-division work taken after the bachelor's degree is granted, or postbaccalaureate-level work. In each instance the fifth year will consist of a program, indi-Spring Summer (2) Ed noc (3) Ed 104H (4) (4) Ed 300C-D-E (12) Ed 162 (4) (1.5) Ed 360 (3) (8) Ed 380 (4) 15.5 15 15 vidually determined and based upon the assessed needs of the student, and where applicable (for example, in the Intern Program), by the hiring school district. Regardless of courses completed prior to the bachelor's degree, students must complete a fifth year to obtain a pro\u00ad fessional clear teaching credential. In addition to the approved program listed above for the Multiple or Single Subject Instruction Credentials, the fifth year must include the following: 1. Completion of 45 quarter units 2. Completion of the following courses: a. Education 162, Psychology and Education of the Excep\u00ad tional Child b. Education 360, Synthesis of the Professional Commitment c. Education 380, Health Education for Teachers UC IRVINE - 1987-1988298 Teacher Education Provision for a Student Teaching Experience Student teaching is defined as a full-day, five-day-per-week assignment, for 18 weeks (or its equivalent) in the appro\u00ad priate classroom training environment. Regular seminars are held as part of the total student teaching program. Evaluation is based on performance, excellence in instruction, and pro\u00ad fessional maturity, factors which are assessed by the resident teacher, the University supervisor, and the candidate. A grade of B or better is required in student teaching in order for a student to be recommended for a teaching credential. If competence has been demonstrated by the conclusion of the student teaching program and all other requirements are met, the student qualifies for recommendation for credential certification by UCI. Multiple Subject Instruction candidates are assigned to teach in grades K-8. The assignment is split to include two levels within this range. Student teaching for Multiple Subject can\u00ad didates consists of assignments with increasing levels of responsibility in each assignment. Single Subject Instruction candidates are assigned in grades 7-12. This assignment may be split to include two levels within this range. The student teaching situation requires the student to be in the school the full day for a full semester (or its equivalent), the same as is required\u00b7 of the regular teacher; student teach\u00ad ing experience includes faculty me~tings, parent conferences, and sponsorship of events. The intern teachiflg program, described earlier, provides another option for fulfilling student teaching requirements. It is a joint responsibility of UCI and the school districts to guarantee that each student will have student teaching expe\u00ad rience in a multi-or cross-cultural situation. Clearances for student teaching are processed by the Office of Teacher Education and are contingent upon the certificate of clearance, a current health clearance, academic preparation clearances, and successful completion of either the National Teacher Examination (NTE) or four-fifths of an approved waiver program. A student must\u00b7apply for a stud~nt teaching assignment the quarter before student teaching. Students are to consult the Office of Teacher Education for appropriate information. Preliminary, Clear, and Life Credentials ' ' Multiple and Single Subject Credentials are of three types: The Preliminary Credential. The Preliminary Credential is awarded by the State upon completion of the baccalaureate, the professional edqcation sequence, a course in the teaching of reading, student teaching, completion of the Applied Technology in Education requirements, a course or examina\u00ad tion covering the U.S. Constitution, a passing score on the California Basjc Educational Skills Test, and by passing the National Teacher Examination or completing an approved waiver as required by the Ryan Act. Under the present program, a student can be authorized to teach in California prior to the completion of the fifth year. However, the fifth year must be completed within five years after the preliminary credential is issued. The Professional Clear Credential. The Professional Clear Credential cannot be awarded by the State until the comple\u00ad tion of (a) a baccalaureate degree, (b) an approved program, and (c) a fifth year. The Life Credential.

The College is dedicated to advancing the knowledge and practice of medicine for the benefit of society. This mission is being achieved through the accomplishment of the following complementary and syner\u00ad gistic objectives: Scholarly research of the highest quality to further the understanding of human biology and the diagnosis, treat\u00ad ment, and prevention of disease. Education of physicians who meet the highest standards of professional competence and achievement. Development of scholars in the clinical and basic sciences who will assume leadership roles in medical practice, educa\u00ad tion, and research. Provision of high-quality medical care to patients through the UCI Clinical Services System that will serve as a model of excellence. Dissemination of the results of advances in medical research and practice. Health Sciences Complex The medical school facilities comprise a 121-acre site which has been designated the Health Sciences Complex. Twenty\u00ad nine acres have been developed to provide space for teaching, research, and patient care as well as offices for departmental administration. The College's basic sciences instructional programs are located in modern, well-equipped, medical sciences buildings. These units provide space for first-and second-year classes, lecture halls, offices and laboratories for various basic and clinical departments, and a student center. Other buildings house the College's administration, laboratories, and the Biomedical Sciences Library. In addition, faculty from the Departments of Pharmacology, Biological Chemistry, and Psychiatry and Human Behavior, and the University of California Southern Occupational Health Center share laboratory space with corporate researchers in a building adjacent to the College. This facility also houses the headquarters of the Nelson Research and Development Company, a private pharmaceutical develop\u00ad ment research firm. Specialized patient care services are now available on campus through the Beckman Laser Institute and Medical Clinic. Housing one of the world's leading programs in medical laser technology, the Beckman Laser Clinic offers state-of-the-art treatment for cancer of the head, neck, or female reproduc\u00ad tive system and for cardiovascular disease. Another campus clinic, soon to undergo construction, is the Lon V. Smith Eye Clinic. This facility will offer the latest in diagnostic health care for eye diseases, including computer\u00ad ized refraction analysis, glaucoma diagnosis, and ultrasound analysis of eye disorders. As of spring 1988, comprehensive patient care services will also become available in the Health Sciences Complex. Under construction is a 40,000 square-foot faculty practice facility which will capitalize upon the broad range of diagnostic and therapeutic programs of the College as well as the extensive clinical expertise of its faculty. The facility will offer services in a variety of specialties, including internal medicine, obstet- UC IRVINE - 1987-1988rics and gynecology, pediatrics, dermatology, ophthalmology, cardiology, orthopedics, and neurology. Special programs in diabetes and multiple sclerosis also will be available. Clinical Services System Medical services offered by the College are provided through the UCI Clinical Services System. This System is comprised of the UCI Medical Center (UCIMC) in Orange, one com\u00ad munity clinic in Santa Ana, another clinic in Anaheim, and numerous affiliated hospitals and clinics located in Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino, and Kern Counties. It incor\u00ad porates the talents and broad range of medical expertise of more than 400 full-time clinical faculty of the College as well as nearly 1,600 community physicians who serve as volun\u00ad tary faculty.

In Behavioral Sciences I, the emphasis is on interviewing \"normal\" people; in Behav\u00ad ioral Sciences II the student learns how to assess pathology. Preventive Medicine This course consists of five main sections: biostatistics, epidemiology, preventive medicine, health administration, and environmental and occupational medicine. The main segment, epidemiology, is presented in formal lectures and laboratory sessions. Methods are given for evaluating the dis\u00ad tribution and possible causation of acute and chronic diseases, including infectious and noninfectious diseases, in human populations. Mechanisms of Disease An organ system approach is utilized in presenting the basic mechanisms or pathophysiology of disease. Introduction to the Clerkships This course combines information from several departments to familiarize the student with the clinical experience. It is a major link in the student's transition from basic science courses to the clinical clerkships. Following this course students will be prepared to commence practical work and begin their clinical clerkships. Third and Fourth Years: Clinical Sciences The clinical experience is composed of (a) core clerkship rota\u00ad tions, with a specific allotment of time in each department and (b) electives. Sequencing of clerkships is determined by a student lottery conducted by the Office of Student and Cur\u00ad ricular Affairs. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988I 318 College of Medicine Clerkships Anesthesiology During the anesthesiology clerkship, students receive instruction in the basic principles of general and regional anesthesia, including the pharmacology of anesthetic drugs, airway management, preoperative evaluation of patients, surgical anesthesia, fluid balance, hazards of anesthesia, resuscitation, and the management of respiratory emergen\u00ad cies. A two-week elective is offered in which students gain familiarity with the technical aspects of anesthesia by spend\u00ad ing each day in the operating room, participating in super\u00ad vised \"hands-on\" patient care. Students attend departmental clinical conferences which are devoted to presentation and discussions of interesting cases and complications. Special rotations through the VAMCLB Surgical Care Unit are also offered. Junior Medicine Students are taught the appropriate diagnostic and therapeu\u00ad tic approach to commonly encountered medical illnesses. The intent is that, in addition to scientific aspects of medical diag\u00ad nosis and therapy, students will develop an appreciation for the importance of psychosocial-economic factors in the care of the patient. Experience is provided with common medical procedures such as lumbar puncture, insertion of catheters, and thoracentesis. The student is expected to assume increas\u00ad ing responsibility for hospitalized patients and to develop an approach to patients' problems which includes references to the appropriate medical literature. Senior Medicine Students spend five weeks as subinterns during which time they carry the full ward responsibility of an intern on one\u00ad half the number of patients usually carried by an intern. A second five weeks is spent on medically related electives. Neurosciences The clinical neurosciences clerkship emphasizes the develop\u00ad ment of student skills in neurological examination as well as the medical and surgical management of patients with brain, nerve, and muscle disease. Obstetrics and Gynecology During this clerkship, students are taught the scientific basis of gynecology and obstetrics, including reproductive physiol\u00ad ogy, anatomy, fetal physiology, and pathology. Practical expe\u00ad rience is offered in the management of normal and abnormal pregnancy and delivery. Instruction is given in office and sur\u00ad gical gynecology. Students who have completed an introduc\u00ad tory clerkship may then apply for an advanced elective that allows a progression of clinical responsibility both in opera\u00ad tive obstetrics and office gynecology. This advanced period also may be devoted to an in-depth study of a subspecialty area such as gynecologic oncology, maternal-fetal medicine, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, or human sexuality. Ophthalmology The core clerkship provides instruction in the basis of oph\u00ad thalmoscopy, slit lamp examination, fundoscopy, visual func\u00ad tion testing, and management of emergency eye problems. Electives from one to four weeks may be taken in clinical suites, with exposure to ophthalmic surgery and emergency eye care. Pediatrics The pediatrics clerkship serves as an introduction to general pediatrics. Students rotate through the pediatric ward, the pediatric outpatient clinic, and the newborn nursery. During the clerkship, students are expected to refine their knowledge and skills in obtaining accurate historical data, performing physical examinations with pediatric patients, and developing appropriate diagnoses and management plans. Subspecialty clinics and community pediatric experiences also are included in the clerkship. The session also offers insight into the natural history of diseases associated with pediatric patients and stresses the relationship of the health of infants, chil\u00ad dren, and adolescents with regard to the integrity of the fam\u00ad ily unit. Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation During the physical medicine and rehabilitation rotation, stu\u00ad dents are assigned patients who are in an active rehabilitation program. Emphasis is placed on the rehabilitation of the total patient. The medical aspects of the patient's care are dis\u00ad cussed in detail. Instruction is provided in the various physi\u00ad cal techniques of rehabilitation and in the psychosocial factors which permanently affect this process. Primary Care Students attend an assigned primary care clinic one-half day per week for five consecutive quintiles during the junior year in either family medicine, internal medicine, or pediatrics. Each student becomes the primary care provider for a number of patients in an ambulatory setting and continues as their primary care provider throughout the clerkship. Under the supervision of primary care faculty, students gain specific primary care skills. This experience in continuous care should provide a basis for a student's selection of a career in a prim\u00ad ary care specialty. Psychiatry The eight-week clinical clerkship is the culmination of the process of learning human behavior as it relates to general medicine. The student elects two four-week clinical rotations participating fully in patient care, clinical teaching, and con\u00ad ferences. Choices include adult inpatient psychiatry, alcoho\u00ad lism, child psychiatry, consultation psychiatry, and emergency room psychiatry. A wide variety of clinical settings and patient populations is available. A required lecture series is presented on Tuesday afternoons at UCIMC. Radiology Radiological sciences involves the diagnostic use of imaging and the therapeutic effect of radiation upon abnormal lesions in the body. Radiological sciences is taught throughout the four years of medical school: during the anatomy course in the first year, in the \"Mechanisms of Disease\" course the second year, as a required clerkship in the third year, and as an elective in the fourth year. The Department has specialists in all subspecialty areas of radiology (nuclear medicine, ultra\u00ad sound, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imag\u00ad ing, spectroscopy) and the general diagnostic areas of radiol\u00ad ogy (chest, bone, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary). There are daily clinical film conferences with staff and residents. The American College of Radiology film learning laboratory is available for student use. There are daily seminars interre\u00ad lating general medicine, surgery, and radiology. Emphasis is UC IRVINE - 1987-1988given to the use of all forms of imaging for diagnosis and treatment including an understanding of the risk/benefit ratios involved and the clinical indications for various radio\u00ad logic procedures. Surgery The surgical clerkship provides students an opportunity to study surgical patients in outpatient and hospital settings as members of the surgical team. Emphasis is placed on the clin\u00ad ical evaluation, pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of surgical diseases. Surgical Subspecialties The objective of the surgical subspecialties clerkship is to provide an opportunity for students to expand their skills and knowledge in the surgical field. Students are required to complete two weeks of surgical subspecialties and can choose from a variety of areas including urology, plastic surgery, and thoracic surgery. Electives A total of 24 weeks in the medical curriculum are allotted for elective time. Sixteen of those weeks are nondesignated elec\u00ad tives, and students, depending upon their particular interests, needs, and goals, may.take a variety of elective courses con\u00ad sisting of at least 30 contact-hours per week beginning in the fourth year. lri addition, five weeks are devoted to a medically related elective which may include pediatrics or fa.mily medi\u00ad cine, and three weeks are devoted to surgically related elec\u00ad tives which may include anesthesiology or obstetrics and gynecology. Electives must be approved by the clinical faculty advisor and the department chair. Students may take up to 12 weeks of electives at institutions other than U<;:I. A listing of elective courses and descriptions can be found in the CCM Electives Handbook, which is available from the Office of Curricular Affairs (on campus), and the Office of Student and Curricular Affairs at the UCI Medical Center.

Research programs in the neu\u00ad rosciences include neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, intracellular physiology, circadian rhythms, neural plasticity, forebrain organization, and the physiology and development of sensory systems. Research programs could also include growth inhibition, cartilage, and pulmonary edema. The Department maintains research facilities that enable the stu\u00ad dent to become experienced with the following techniques: and computer analyses of neuroscientific data. Students, by means of a comprehensive techniques course, become proficient in multiple areas of study using numerous interdisciplinary techniques. Students in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology have two major goals. The first goal is to attain the technical skills, theoretical background, and experimental knowledge necessary to conduct innovative and fundamental research. The second goal is to become knowledgeable scientists with the ability to teach graduate, undergraduate, and professional courses in anatomy and neuroscience. These two goals are achieved through a flexible academic program that is tailored to the individual needs of the student. The core curriculum is designed to provide all students with a fundamental knowledge of gross, cellular, and subcellular anatomy; physiology; and biochemistry. In the first year, stu\u00ad dents will be required to take neuroanatomy, microscopic anatomy, techniques in the neural sciences, biochemistry, and physiology. Over the usual four-year training period the stu\u00ad dent will be required to complete a practical course in statis\u00ad tics, selected departmental se~inar courses, at least two laboratory tutorials, and a total of 50 credit hours of research College of Medicine 323 in anatomy. Elective courses in the Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology or other departments on campus may also be taken; examples include pharmacology, psychobiology, cell biology, genetics, computer science, pathology, and physiol\u00ad ogy. The student typically devotes the majority of the first year to taking core courses and about half of the second year to taking electives. Usually, no courses are taken in the third year. Following the first year, the student is expected to act as an assistant in one major anatomy core course. When a student is accepted into the graduate program, the student and the Graduate Committee decide to which labora\u00ad tories the student will be assigned the first year. During the first year the student will spend approximately 25 percent of the time doing research. At the beginning of the second year the student and the Graduate Committee select a faculty sponsor who will supervise the dissertation research. A Qual\u00ad ifying Examination at the end of the summer of the second year is given to the student by a Candidacy Committee. The examination covers basic neuroscience and focuses on the candidate's field of specialization. The dissertation research is chosen by the student and faculty advisor under guidance of the Graduate Committee. The majority of the second, third, and fourth year is devoted to completing the research and preparing a written disserta\u00ad tion suitable for publication. An oral defense of the dissertation research before the stu\u00ad dent's advisor and Doctoral Committee constitutes the final examination. The Ph.D. degree in Biological Sciences is awarded following completion of all the requirements, a pro\u00ad cess that normally will take four years to complete. Information on specific course descriptions in anatomy can be found in the School of Biological Sciences section. Biological Chemistry Participating Faculty Ralph A.

Other roles for program gradu\u00ad ates may include employment in local, state, or federal genet\u00ad ics programs, in categorical disease foundations, or in public education. Division faculty and staff are involved in teaching, research, and patient service. Clinical activities include evaluation, early ascertainment, prenatal diagnosis, prevention, and manage\u00ad ment of genetic disorders, birth defects, and developmentally disabling conditions. Among faculty research interests are gene mapping and linkage analysis using DNA probes; the incidence and perceptidn of genetic disease, birth defects, and developmental disabili\u00ad ties in underserved ethnic populations; factors in the etiology of chromosomal abnormalities and congenital malformations; psychosocial issues in genetic disease and prenatal diagnosis; and delivery of genetic services. During the six to eight academic quarters of the program, students must complete a sequence of core courses in medical genetics, biochemical and molecular genetics, cytogenetics, child development, counseling issues and techniques, research methodology, ethical issues, and community re-sources. Experiential professional training occurs concur\u00ad rently with formal course work in a variety of clinics at the UCI Medical Center, in the prenatal diagnosis program, in the cytogenetics laboratory, and in certain community agen\u00ad cies. Participation in these and other divisional and depart\u00ad mental professional and educational activities such as lec\u00ad tures, seminars, Pediatric Grand Rounds, cytogenetic rounds, and research, counseling, and patient management conferen\u00ad ces is expected throughout the program. Completion of the program requires a minimum of 58 quar\u00ad ter units of credit, a research thesis which should be publish\u00ad able, and demonstration of satisfactory professional skills in genetic counseling. The program director serves as faculty advisor to students, although teaching and supervision of professional experiential training is shared among all division faculty and staff, who frequently review student progress. In the second year, development of professional skills can be individualized according to the student's needs and interests. It is anticipated that graduates will be eligible for American Board of Medical Genetics certification in genetic counseling within a year of completing the program. Recommended undergraduate preparation includes course work in the biological sciences, especially in genetics, bio\u00ad chemistry, physiology, psychology, and human development. Course work in statistics is desirable. Facility in Spanish or a Southeast Asian language is a considerable asset. Extracur\u00ad ricular and/or employment experiences which provide evi\u00ad dence of the student's maturity, interpersonal skills, and promise as a genetics counselor figure prominently in the admissions decision. References should speak to these quali\u00ad ties as well as to the academic qualifications of the applicant. Graduate Record Examination (GRE) General Test scores must be submitted and Subject Test scores will be considered if they are available. Applications are accepted for the fall quarter only and must be completed by February 1. Because of keen competition for places in the program, a two-stage admissions process is employed, with approximately one-fifth of the applicants being invited for interviews at UCI following an initial review by the faculty. Interviews usually are conducted from March through early April, and the final selection is made from among the interviewed candidates during mid-to late April.

The curriculum provides the student with a broad background in physiology and biophysics and the closely related fields of anatomy and biochemistry. Elective courses permit in-depth exploration of particular areas. Interdisciplinary dissertation research involv\u00ad ing the research of more than one faculty member is encouraged. Prerequisites for admission normally include a bachelor's degree in one of the biological sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, or engineering, as well as undergraduate courses in calculus, organic and physical chemistry, biochem\u00ad istry, and advanced biology (e.g., neurophysiology, cell biol\u00ad ogy, neurobiology, psychobiology). Up to two prerequisites may be fulfilled as first-year electives. GRE General Test scores are required. Preference will be given to those stu\u00ad dents who have prior research experience. The Department admits about three highly qualified students each fall. The program emphasizes original research, and stu\u00ad dents are expected to become involved in the research of the Department as early as possible. The core program includes graduate courses in physiology, biophysics, biochemistry, and cell biology. After the first year, training will follow the clas\u00ad sical tutorial pattern in which a small number of students are tutored by the faculty in an informal setting. Students also will participate in a program of laboratory rotations and attend the weekly colloquium in physiology. The third and fourth years will be spent primarily in research, with some participation in teaching physiology to medical students. Each student must submit a written dissertation on an original research project and successfully defend this dissertation in an oral examination. Incoming students will receive academic advising from the Department Graduate Advisor until such time as they choose a thesis advisor. The faculty conducts quarterly reviews of all continuing students to ensure that they are maintaining satisfactory progress within their particular academic pro\u00ad gram. Students who have completed all necessary prerequi\u00ad sites should be able to complete the Ph.D. within five years. A comprehensive examination will be administered in June at the end of the second year. The examination is based upon the tutorials in advanced physiology and is designed to test the student's ability to organize a body of knowledge and to think critically. Some time during the third year, the student will present a seminar on a topic approved by the formal can\u00ad didacy committee. Following the seminar, the committee will critically examine the student's qualifications for the success\u00ad ful conduct of the doctoral dissertation. Advancement to can\u00ad didacy for the Ph.D. is recommended to the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies upon the unanimous vote of the committee. Information on course descriptions may be found in the School of Biological Sciences section.

Both programs are oriented toward the education and training of the superior student who has the potential and desire to become a creative and productive member of the medical or medical-related communities. The primary concentration of the program is in imaging. A broad-based, interdisciplinary curriculum places heavy emphasis on research and is designed to provide the student with a comprehensive knowledge of the field in addition to an excepfionally high level of competence in one or more subspecialties. By utilizing the training received in medical imaging, medical physics, bioengineering, radiobiology, and radiological engineering, the student should be prepared for a wide range of career opportunities in university, hospital, or industrial settings upon completion of this program. Prospec\u00ad tive students are cautioned that the program is extremely UC IRVINE - 1987-1988demanding and requires a broad base of knowledge in a vari\u00ad ety of the conventional disciplines. The Department of Radiological Sciences has well-equipped research laboratories in imaging physics, radiation biology, radiation physics, radio-pharmacy, and radiological engineer\u00ad ing located on campus and at the hospitals associated with the University of California, Irvine. The core program plus additional courses as may be required by the Graduate Committee normally will require two years to complete. To receive either the M.S. or Ph.D. degree, the student must successfully complete the core courses or their equivalents. Requirements for the M.S. degree may be satisfied in one of two ways. Under Plan I, the student completes the Radiologi\u00ad cal Sciences core program with an average grade of B or above and under the direction of a faculty advisor also pre\u00ad pares a thesis that is acceptable to the thesis committee. Under Plan II, the student completes the core program plus a minimum of eight additional credits (all with an average grade of B or above) in a given area of specialization and satisfactorily passes a comprehensive written examination. Requirements for the Ph.D. degree may be divided into four stages. First, the student must complete the core program and take additional course work as recommended by the Graduate Committee, all with an average grade of B or above. Second, the student must pass a written and oral qual\u00ad ifying examination given at the end of the second full year of study. A student who fails the preliminary qualifying exami\u00ad nation can, with approval from the Graduate Committee, repeat the examination the following year. Third, within a year after passing the preliminary examination, the student must pass the final oral qualifying examination covering the proposed field of research and be advanced to candidacy. Finally, a dissertation representing original research in the student's principal field of study must be prepared and defended. The dissertation, conducted under the direction of the doctoral committee, represents the major element in the doctoral program; it must be a significant contribution to the field and is expected to demonstrate critical judgment, intel\u00ad lectual synthesis, and creativity. During the final quarter of graduate study the student is required to defend the disserta\u00ad tion in an oral examination conducted by the doctoral committee. Admission to the graduate program is by the Dean of Gradu\u00ad ate Studies and Research upon recommendation of the Department and is based upon letters of recommendation, Graduate Record Examination scores, previous scholarship, and other qualifications. Applicants should have a broad undergraduate background in both the physical and the bio\u00ad logical sciences as well as in mathematics. Since most stu\u00ad dents will need some additional work in one or more disci\u00ad plines, the graduate program allows for the correction of minor deficiencies during the first year, as determined by departmental review. Although the program is rigorous, it is also sufficiently flexible to allow for a wide range of interests and objectives. Application deadline for the fall quarter is June 1 of each year. However, to receive full consideration for financial assistance, fall quarter applications should be completed by February 1. Applications for the winter and spring quarters will be accepted only under special circumstances. Graduate Courses in Radiological Sciences 2.01A-B Fundamentals of Imaging Physics (4-4) F, W.

A handbook is avail\u00ad able which sets forth standards of conduct expected of UCI stu\u00ad dents. This booklet, \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organ\u00ad izations, and Students,\" gives rules concerning conduct and related matters, as established by the policies of the Regents and the Presi\u00ad dent of the University. The booklet incorporates campus regulations also. Copies are available from the Ombudsman, who is located in 260 Administration Building, and from the Student Activities OffiCe, located in University Center. Student Records The University of California campuses maintain various types of records pertaining to students; some are maintained for academic purposes; others, such as hospital and employment records, are maintained for other specific purposes. Student records-that is, those pertaining to students in their capacity as students-include but are not limited to academic evaluations, transcripts, test scores and other academic records, general counseling and advising records, disciplinary records, and financial aid records. The disclosure of information from student records is governed in large measure by the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, by the State of California Education Code, and by Uni\u00ad versity policy and procedures implementing these laws which pro\u00ad tect the student's right of privacy, provide safeguards for the confi\u00ad dentiality of student records, and permit students access to their own records. Pursuant to the Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 and the University of California Policies Applying to the Disclosure of Information from Student Records, students at the University have the following five rights: 1. to inspect and review records pertaining to themselves in their capacity as students; 2. to inspect records maintained by the campus of disclosure of per\u00ad sonally identifiable information from their student records; 3. to seek correction of their student records through a request to amend the records or a request for a hearing; 4. to file complaints with the Department of Health and Human Services regarding alleged violations of the rights accorded them by the Act; and 5. to have withheld from disclosure, in the absence of their prior consent for release, personally identifiable information from their student records, with exceptions as noted in the University student records policies. NOTE: There are instances in which information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student. University officials may require access to student records in the course of the performance of their assigned duties. Further, confidential information can be disclosed without prior written consent of the student (a) in connection with con\u00ad ditions of certain financial aid awards; (b) when the campus is com\u00ad plying with a judicial order or subpoena; and (c) when authorized fed\u00ad eral or Slate officials are conducting an audit or evaluation of federally supported educational programs. There are also other situations in ( which the University is required to disclose information. See Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students, Part B, Section 10. 7 21 for a list of exceptions. Normally, the campus will release the following as personally identi\u00ad fiable information which can be made public: Student's name; Address (campus, local, and/or permanent) and telephone numbers; Date and place of birth; Major field of study, dates of attendance, degrees and honors received; Most recent previous educational institution attended; Participation in officially recognized activities, including intercolle\u00ad giate athletics; Name, weight, and height of participants on intercollegiate Univer\u00ad sity athletic teams. UC IRVINE - 1987-1988334 Student Records/Salary and Employment Information However, students have the right to refuse to permit any or all of these categories to be designated public information with respect to themselves. (See the NOTE above.) If a student requests that information from his or her records not be regarded as public information, then the information will not be released to anyone without the written consent of the student. The student should be aware of the important implications of exercising this right. For example, if a request is made to withhold from dis\u00ad closure a student's name and degrees and honors received, the cam\u00ad pus cannot release for publication information on any honors received by the student, such as election to Phi Beta Kappa, and cannot include the student's name and degree earned in the campus commencement program without the written consent of the stu\u00ad dent. Similarly, if a request is made to withhold from disclosure a student's name and dates of attendance, a student's status as a stu\u00ad dent cannot be verified for potential employers without the written consent of the student. Further, if a student's last instruction to the campus was to withhold from disclosure the degree granted to that student and the date on which the degree was conferred, that information cannot be confirmed for a third party in connection with the appointment of that graduate to a new position or in con\u00ad nection with an honor that individual received without the written consent of the student. Students wishing to restrict release of public information should contact the Registrar's Office for instructions on how to do so. Questions regarding the rights of students under the University policies and the federal law should be directed to the Vice Chancel\u00ad lor Student Affairs or that person's designee, 260 Administration. A Personal Data Sheet is included in each quarter's registration packet which allows students to examine and update their personal data. Furthermore, during the eighth week of classes, every student is provided with a record of current term enrollment as part of his or her registration materials for the next quarter to ensure the accuracy of official enrollment. Students are urged to report offi\u00ad cially to the Registrar's Office all changes in personal data and en\u00ad rollment data. It is extremely important for each student to keep the Registrar's Office currently informed as changes occur to assure that accurate and complete records are maintained. Students are informed annually of their rights under the Univer\u00ad sity's student records policies and the federal Act. Copies of the Act and University and campus policies are available for review in the Reference Room, Main Library. In addition, University policies are published in the booklet \"Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students-Part B,\" copies of which are available in the Student Activities Office. Complaints regarding alleged violation of the rights accorded stu\u00ad dents by the federal Act may be filed with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act Office (FERPA), Department of Education, 4511 Switzer Building, Washington, D.C. 20202.
