Make sure to grab our Holistic Wellness Guides that detail the different holistic recommendations for dogs and cats throughout their life. You may find all of the information needed in our eBooks and Wellness Course or you can purchase a personalized hair tissue and nutritional plan with the natural pet doctor, Dr. Katie Woodley. How can I find a holistic veterinarian near me? Do you know if there is a holistic vet in my area? The best way to find an integrative or holistic veterinarian near you is to go to ahvma.org (American Holistic Veterinary Medical Association) where you can search by zip code. You can also check out our [blog post.](https://thenaturalpetdoctor.com/holistic-vet-in-my-area-how-do-i-find-a-holistic-vet-near-me/) If you can't find a local holistic veterinarian, we offer [online programs](https://thenaturalpetdoctor.com/shop/) where you can get help and support from Dr. Katie Woodley to learn more about holistic pet health, cat and dog nutrition, gut health support and many more topics that are essential for your pet feeling their best and living a long and vibrant life. Do you guarantee results? Just like anything in life, we cannot guarantee results for our recommendations. However, we have seen countless amazing results from our holistic treatment plans that helped dogs and cats feel their best again, and even reverse disease. We do our best to ensure that the recommendations are the most optimal for your pet and their condition and works for you and your budget. Holistic medicine can take longer to see results when compared with conventional medicine, because we are treating and addressing the root cause versus just taking away symptoms with a pill or medication. If your pet has had a chronic condition for months to years, please be patient with the treatment plan. Usually it will take a few months to a year sometimes to reverse the disease and treat the root problem, depending on the condition that is being treated. This is also why we created the lifetime blueprint program so you can continue to receive help and support from a holistic veterinarian. Are there any refunds? There are no refunds for services that have been rendered. Because herbal medicine and supplements are shipped from a third-party, refunds are not available for products that you receive through us and will be dictated by those companies' return policies. If you cancel an appointment, less than 24 hours prior to your appointment, or if Dr. Katie has already spent time reviewing your medical records, her time will be compensated and you may be charged a re-booking or cancellation fee (please read the terms and conditions when booking an appointment). If you cancel or reschedule your appointment more than 3 times in a year, you will lose 100% of your consultation fee. How does holistic medicine work? Holistic medicine works very differently than the conventional medicine model. Whole body health is the focus to figure out where imbalances lie and how to fix the root cause of disease versus simply treating symptoms, which is why the frustration of continually going to the vet clinic for the same issue continues to happen. We're able to utilize food therapy, Chinese herbal medicine, essential oils in dogs and cats, acupuncture and other natural remedies to help your pets heal their bodies. Here's an educational video with Dr. Katie that explains the difference between holistic medicine and conventional medicine: WANT MORE NATURAL PET HEALTH GUIDANCE? We've got you covered.
