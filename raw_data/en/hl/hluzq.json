However, it is strongly recommended that the entire university community [stay up to date with all recommended COVID boosters](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/stay-up-to-date.html). Note: Students in the schools of Education, Health Sciences, Medicine and Nursing with clinical/education placements must confirm vaccination and/or booster requirements with their clinical, fieldwork and/or internship coordinator. Students who are in the professional component of the following programs are required to have the primary COVID-19 vaccine and booster (or single bivalent vaccine): Athletic Training, Cardiovascular Perfusion, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Medicine, Nursing, Occupational Therapy, Pathologist Assistant, Physical Therapy, Physician Assistant, Radiologist Assistant, and Radiologic Sciences. Students may apply for medical or religious exemptions in their school's dean's office. These school policies supersede QU COVID vaccination/booster policies. Students who do not comply with the school requirement risk their eligibility for assignment to clinical, fieldwork and/or internship sites, and therefore, continuation of their program of study. A pre-arrival test is not required before returning for the start of the Fall 2023 semester. "}
