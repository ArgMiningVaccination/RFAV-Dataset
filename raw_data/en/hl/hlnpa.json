(Heads up \u2014 I am not getting paid to promote any of these products or services, I simply want to share these babies with you because I love them, and I love you!) For Health Barre Body There are loads of these type of barre classes popping up everywhere now, which I love. I used to be a professional dancer and [Barre Body](https://barrebody.com.au/) takes me right back to my ballet days. I love it! If only I could wear my tutu. Fermented Veggies These probiotic-rich veggies are jam-packed with goodies to get your guts running like a well (coconut) oiled machine. I love [Peace Love & Vegetables](http://peaceloveandvegetables.com.au/) \u2014 they are delish! Bone Broth Bone broth helps restore the healthy mucosal lining in the gut. It's jam-packed with gelatine and collagen and is also high in proline (a super-important amino acid).

Podcasts - The Wellness Guys ( [podcast](http://thewellnesscouch.com/category/twg)) - ReWild Yourself [podcast episode](http://www.danielvitalis.com/rewild-yourself-podcast/)) - Up For A Chat ( [podcast](http://thewellnesscouch.com/category/uc)) Books - Primal Body Primal Mind, by Nora Gedgaudas ( [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1594774137/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1594774137&linkCode=as2&tag=melissaambcom-20&linkId=OLJJEHOE2JU2J3KN)) When it comes to food, health and wellness, this is my bible. Yes, it's chunky and full of scientific lingo, but in order to make informed, conscious choices around your food and health, you need to be well-educated on all the facts. I read it because I wanted to understand more about the link between the way we eat and our evolution, and this book helps you understand exactly how we are supposed to eat and why. - The Body Ecology Diet, by Donna Gates ( [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1401935435/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1401935435&linkCode=as2&tag=melissaambcom-20&linkId=KMJEEVVOBF5KTIVC)) I used to experience bloating, candida, adult acne and eczema. It wasn't until I read this book and adopted The Body Ecology principles into my life that all my health concerns dramatically improved. There are so many ideas and insights in this wellness classic which have changed my life \u2014 you won't regret reading it. - Women, Food and God, by Geneen Roth ( [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1416543082/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1416543082&linkCode=as2&tag=melissaambcom-20&linkId=LF2PKQC2RAOOUXXS)) With all my clients, in my talks, on my blog and in my book 12 Steps To Wellness, I've been repeating one essential truth for years: the way we eat is a direct reflection of every other area of our lives. This is the message that Geneen Roth shares in Women, Food and God. This book perfectly describes how to heal your relationship with food and how to end your tortuous relationship with your body. Apps [Period Tracker](https://itunes.apple.com/au/app/period-tracker-lite/id330376830?mt=8) \u2014 This app is awesome for tracking your moon cycle, which I highly recommend all ladies do. Institute Of Integrative Nutrition Whether you want to become a health coach or just amp up your own knowledge on health and wellness for yourself and your family, this year-long course is amazing and one of the best things you can do for yourself. I loved it! Make Up My beautiful friend Emmily from [Depths of Beauty](http://www.depthsofbeauty.com.au/) is an organic make-up artist and she is constantly keeping me updated with the latest goodies that are actually good for you. Although I don't wear a lot of make-up, when I do I want to make sure it's got zero nasties and is actually nourishing my skin, which is why I love Ere Perez and Inika. Skin Care Products Like make-up, I am very simple with what I put on my skin. I use organic extra virgin coconut oil as my moisturiser, to take off my make-up, and as a treatment for my hair. You can find out everything else I use in this post [here](https://melissaambrosini.com/health/holistic-beauty-tips). Clothes I am always getting asked where I shop and what I am wearing (which is very flattering \u2014 thank you!). A few of my favourite labels are: Sass and Bide, Alice McCall and Tigerlily. Sheets I LOVE my [YoHome](http://www.yohome.com.au/) bamboo sheets. We spend half our lives in our beds, so this is definitely a place I love to turn into a divine little wellness sanctuary. For Wealth Meditation If you want to be successful and wildly wealthy [meditation is key](https://melissaambrosini.com/health/meditation-masterclass-tom-cronin). Books - The 4-Hour Workweek, by Tim Ferriss ( [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0307465357&linkCode=as2&tag=melissaambcom-20&linkId=XZ2FT353HMFWM4WT)) When I first started my business, I thought I had to sit in front of my computer all day and night or I wouldn't be successful. This book made me realise that it's not about working harder, it's about working smarter. The 4-Hour Workweek gives you all the tools you need to set up and create the freedom-based business you desire. - Turning Pro, by Steven Pressfield ( [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1936891034/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1936891034&linkCode=as2&tag=melissaambcom-20&linkId=TXQFUVG7UXIA7RLJ)) This book talks about the concept of being an amateur versus being a 'pro'. Reading it was quite a pivotal moment for me. It helped me see all the stinky, amateur habits I was relying on, and that I needed to 'turn pro' in many areas of my life \u2014 not just within my business. This is a quick and easy read that you won't be able to put down.

For Love Nature Time - The Bondi to Bronte coastal walk in Sydney. This beach-side path along the cliffs is just breathtaking. No matter how many times I do it, it still blows my mind. - The Noosa to Sunshine Beach walk. This is another jaw-dropping scenic walk that will get you high on Mama Nature's love. - Tea Tree Beach in Noosa \u2014 I love packing a picnic and heading here for the day with my family. It's such a magical spot. Make Love I know this might sound obvious but if you want more love in your life make sweet love to your lover.

I read it before we got together and something really shifted within me. This book showed me what is truly possible within a conscious union. It opened my eyes to the divine beauty that can unfold when two people come together, get out of the way, and choose love. - The Gifts Of Imperfections, by Bren\u00e9 Brown ( [book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/159285849X/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=159285849X&linkCode=as2&tag=melissaambcom-20&linkId=HGLTKC4XK2AUIOJU)) Another supreme book from Bren\u00e9 Brown. I couldn't put it down \u2014 her wit, wisdom and humor make you want to devour every word in one sitting. This book made me see that I was striving for perfectionism when 'perfect' doesn't even exist. A truly powerful read. Now it's over to you, beautiful!
