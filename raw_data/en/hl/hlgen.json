Many autistic children have been granted legal aid to pursue claims that their condition was caused by the [MMR](https://www.theguardian.com/society/mmr) vaccine. There is no evidence of association between the vaccine and autism. The High Court has stated that 'no positive link has ever been established'. This unsubstantiated health scare (funded by the Legal Services Commission) endangers children and enriches lawyers. Penelope Elphinstone London NW1 Professor Andrew Wakefield is apparently in trouble at University College London and the Royal Free Hospital for expressing scientific views which his masters do not like. Once again, we see a researcher being pilloried and 'released' from his job because of his findings, made in good faith. Can anyone begin to imagine what problems we are storing up for the future when we deny our university scientists the freedom of dissent? Dr Wakefield's case provides a warning to all administrators and politicians - be very careful which horse you back and which you have 'put down'. After all, all lives are at stake.
