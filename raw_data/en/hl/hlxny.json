Scott Evans, MS, PhD, FACMI (excerpt from the Applied Clinical Informatics Journal; 12:179-181) Background Dr. Reed M. Gardner, PhD, FACMI, a pioneer and noted international leader in the field of Medical Informatics passed away on November 27, 2020. Dr. Gardner earned a Bachelor of Science in electrical engineering in 1960 and a PhD in Biophysics and Bioengineering in 1968 from the University of Utah, United States. He was one of the first graduate students of Dr. HomerWarner and after graduation continued to work with Dr. Warner at LDS Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. He later served as co-director of the Medical Informatics department at LDS Hospital in the late 1980s and early 1990s while Dr. Warner continued as chair of the Department of Medical Informatics at the University of Utah. After Dr.Warner retired, Dr. Gardner became the Chair of the Department ofMedical Informatics at the University of Utah from 1996 to 2005. After retiring in 2005, Dr. Gardner continued to participate in projects, reviewed submitted publications for various peer reviewed journals, and was a valued contributor to books. Personal Contributions Dr. Gardner was one of the principal developers and evaluators of one of the first electronic medical records known as the HELP System (Health Evaluation through Logical Processing). Early in his career, he independently developed an innovative new arterial line pressure sensor but did not pursue the patent. He also helped standardize pulmonary function testing, monitoring cardiac output and spirometry in intensive care units (ICUs), use of clinical decision support in the ICU, helped move from hard copy radiology film to a picture archiving and communication system (PACS), computer alerts for laboratory data, computerized blood ordering and helped develop the early Medical Information Bus used in ICUs to pull data from patient monitors and other medical equipment into the EMR. Dr. Gardner was active in public policy, helped build the nation's electronic health record interoperability policies, and was active in standards development. He supported security for patient data in the EMR and helped implement early password So What? A Tribute to Dr. Reed M. Gardner, PhD, FACMIGardner Tribute, continued 7protection. After a visit to Kenya, he also became interested in the evolution and necessity of EMR use in third-world countries using OpenMRS. International and National Contribution to the Field During his career, Dr. Gardner was a sought- after visiting professor at leading academic medical centers around the world and a frequent presenter and panel expert at many national and international meetings, and was known for his substantial expertise, enthusiasm, and communication skills. He had extensive and innovative academic and research interests including hospital informatics systems, computerized medical decision-making, and clinical decision support, computerization of critical care, automation of clinical processes, medical informatics education, and public health informatics. Dr. Gardner served 8 years on the American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Board of Directors and was AMIA President from1996 to 1997. In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) was thinking of regulating CDS as medical devices. Dr. Gardner is one of the authors and instigators of AMIA's recommendation for a risk-based approach to regulation of clinical software through the use of local software oversight committees to monitor CDS. The AMIA proposal was accepted by the FDA and still guides the regulatory approach today. Dr. Gardner was also an influential and a driving force behind the development of the board certification in Clinical Informatics for physicians through the American Board of Preventive Medicine. He served as chair of the Core Content committee, and the resulting document still serves as the study guide for the Clinical Informatics Board Exam. Former Utah governor and subsequent secretary of the Health and Human Services in the U.S. Mike Leavitt attributed his interest in health information technology to numerous conversations he had with Dr. Gardner. Mr. Leavitt then supported the creation of the Office of the National Coordinator for health care technologyand early efforts that laid the foundation for Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act. In 2005, Dr. Gardner was the recipient of the Morris Collen Award, which is the highest award given by the American College of Medical Informatics. He continued to serve on several editorial boards of informatics and clinical journals and in 2006 received the Legacy of Life Award for Scientific Achievement from the Intermountain Health Care Research and Medical Foundation. Teacher and Mentor Dr. Gardner was a colleague in Informatics Education in Health care and in 1998 was instrumental in getting the University of Utah as one of the charter members of International Partnership of Health Informatics Education. The other charter members were the University of Amsterdam, Netherlands, Universities in Heidelberg/Heilbronn, Germany, University of Minnesota, US, the University for Health Informatics and Technology Tyrol, Austria and the University of Washington in Seattle, United States. This partnership grew out of the 1996 idea at the University of Amsterdam that teaching programs should be \"internationalized\" and stimulate students to carry out part of their studies at universities abroad, with the aim to become more aware of the increasingly important international environment. Moreover, Dr. Gardner was influential in interesting many people inmedical informatics along with encouraging graduate students and young colleagues to do good research. No matter how good you thought your manuscript or dissertation was, you knew it would return marked up with his \"red pen\" that was always in his shirt pocket. Every project proposal or idea would be open to a discussion based on whether it was sound science and the inevitable question \"so what?\"; meaning how would it improve patient care and how would you prove it? He was raised on a sheep farm and if your explanation was not precise, he would say \"you've got to explain that better for an old sheepherder like me.\" While he combined a tough critique and tireless efforts Gardner Tribute, continued 8to get work as precise as possible, he provided constant encouragement and stimulated all to improve their work. He was generous with his time and attention and when timelines got close, he could be seen giving graduate students and colleagues feedback on a manuscript or project at his kitchen table in the evening. He knew how to get people involved and get approval from hospital administrators and said medical informatics is 10% technology and 90% sociology. Colleagues and former students have related on how his contributions have enhanced the scientific and educational rigor of Medical Informatics, how he promoted and expected academic freedom and scholarly debate and understood how engineering could help transform medicine. Dr. Gardner's work is proof of the impact of our field on medicine and we all valued his pragmatic approach and his focus on the fundamentals. Many of his colleagues wonder if there is anyone in the field of Medical Informatics that he did not touch. In 2005, the annual University of Utah's Dr. Reed M. Gardner Award for Faculty Excellence was established to acknowledge the contributions of faculty members to the Department of Biomedical Informatics and Nursing Informatics. The award was created by students to acknowledge the achievements of faculty members in the areas of teaching, mentoring, and service to the departments. Dr. Gardner will be sorely missed. His legacy in helping to expand the impact of the first department of biomedical informatics in a school of medicine in the United States and his innovation in the field will continue. This tribute to Dr. Gardner is based on many memories and comments collected from his colleagues and former graduate students. Multiple Choice Questions 1. Which of Dr. Reed Gardner's contributions still serves as a regulatory approach today? a. The methods to develop electronic medical records. b. Standards used for pulmonary function testing. c. Recommendation for regulation of clinical software through the use of local software oversight committees. d. Computerized blood ordering. Correct Answer: Option c is the correct answer. This proposal drafted by Dr. Gardner for AMIA was accepted by the U.S. Food and Drug Association and still guides the regulatory approach today. 2.

This tool was implemented this past fall in BMI 6010 Foundations of Healthcare. Students used Epic to learn how to navigate the medical record to find relevant patient information, document clinical encounters and build Clinical Decision support roles (BPas). Students really enjoyed the activities, and we are hoping to incorporate Epic in other courses in the future. DBMI offered a course in Deep Learning for the first time in 2021. Dr. Samir Abdelrahman developed and taught the course with very positive feedback from the students. The course has been added to the Data Science track in the MS program. We are also happy to tell you that these courses are now electives for the Data Science Program on main campus highlighting our OneU mindset. THE EDUCATION ADMIN TEAM Thank you to Barb Saffel, Robert Barber and Shiva Sanafi for the amazing support they give our department. Reed Gardner Award for Faculty Excellence We're proud to announce the winners of the Reed M. Gardner Award for Faculty Excellence for 2020 and 2021. This award was created by the students in the Departments of Biomedical Informatics and Nursing Informatics to acknowledge the achievements of faculty members in the areas of teaching, mentoring, and service to the departments and is a competitive nomination and decision process. We are pleased to acknowledge Catherine Staes as the winner for 2021. As she stated when told, \"I really value my role as an educator and want to build up the next generation.\" She is a valued member of our education team! In addition, our last year's winner for 2020 is Damian Borbolla. Unfortunately, the pandemic hit at just the time when the students voted on the winner so this wasn't awarded to Dr. Borbolla at that time. Dr. Borbolla is another very valued member of our faculty. When he was told that he received this award, his response was, \"this is a great honor, the best award I received in my professional career.\" Congratulations to Drs. Staes and Borbolla. They represent our faculty well! DBMI ALUMNI HIGHLIGHT Francine Stirling loves to get creative. Whether it's finding time to read a good book while staying busy as a mom to three children or juggling full-time work with the challenge of completing graduate school, Stirling thrives on finding solutions. Stirling spent ten years as an academic program manager for three different departments at the University of Utah, working with students to advance their educational and professional goals. Stirling created curriculum and led advising efforts for the Professional Science and Technology Program, the PhD Bioscience Program, and the Biomedical Informatics Department. In these areas, she was surrounded by the latest curriculum and exciting advancements in programming, medical data science, and other information technologies. Eventually, she took note of the encouragement she gave others, and decided to begin her own master's program in the Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI). Working with a wide variety of students and faculty in different specialties, managing team members, and developing complex courses of study meant Stirling already had credible career experience. Her familiarity with classes and requirements needed in the DBMI's master's program gave her an edge, but she didn't feel like she needed a purely scientific background to be successful. While many of her classmates came from science-based majors, her education in communications, and professional management skills, proved to be equal assets. \"A bachelor's degree is important, but it doesn't need to be rooted in technology or science,\" Stirling explains. \"I felt like my perspective added a lot of value.\" Stirling initially worried that her technical knowledge might be too weak to excel in her courses, but the curriculum in her track quickly brought her up to speed. \"Your strengths balance your weaknesses,\" Stirling explains. \"My background helped me see things in a different light, and I felt my curiosity kick in to tackle the areas I knew less about.\" The program, much like the data technology industry itself, is nimble. Students can choose from different tracks best suited to their needs and interests. Stirling opted for the clinical informatics track, which is a broader area of study. According to Damian Borbolla, MD, MS, and director of the DBMI master's program, this track gives students a solid knowledge base applicable to many areas in the field such as health systems, information technology companies, and biotech industries. Students build upon foundational skills like database design, clinical decision support, leadership, and health care standards. They leave the program primed to contribute to a workforce focused on data improvement. The hybrid learning mode featuring both online and in-person classes was an ideal balance of engagement and flexibility for Stirling. \"The way this master's program is set up is really accommodating for non-traditional students or those working full-time,\" Stirling says. \"Making this advancement wouldn't have been an option if I'd had to go to class during the day.\" To view the entire article, please see HERE. 14 Diving into Problem Solving in the Informatics WayKensaku Kawamoto, MD, PhD, MHS Vice-Chair, Clinical Operations CLINICAL OPERATIONS Faculty, fellows, and staff in the Department collaborate closely with clinical stakeholders at the University of Utah and beyond to improve patient care and the provider experience. Some highlights of the Department's engagement in clinical operations are described below. REIMAGINE EHR INITIATIVE The University's ReImagine EHR initiative continues to be a national leader in the design, development, implementation, and evaluation of interoperable digital innovations that are integrated with the EHR to improve patient care and the provider experience ( https:// reimagineehr.utah.edu /). Dr. Ken Kawamoto, Vice-Chair for Clinical Operations and Associate Chief Medical Information Officer for the health system, leads this initiative in close collaboration with a number of faculty, fellows, staff, and operational leaders across the University of Utah, including Drs. Guilherme Del Fiol, Charlene Weir, Damian Borbolla, Bryan Gibson, Bruce Bray, Polina Kukhareva, Teresa Taft, Keaton Morgan, Rick Bradshaw, Salvador Rodriguez, Emerson Borsato, and Doug Martin in the Department. The ReImagine EHR initiative has implemented over 10 standards-based, EHR-integrated solutions. An overview of the ReImagine EHR initiative and key projects is available in JAMIA Open at https:// academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/4/3/ ooab041/6333015 . Many of the efforts that are a part of this initiative are supported by research grants and are described in the Research section of the newsletter. RESIDENT INFORMATICS PROGRAM The Resident Informatics Program is an institution- wide education program that aims to teach resident physicians the fundamental knowledge and skills of clinical informatics. The program was created in 2021 by Dr. Keaton Morgan during the last year of his National Library of Medicine postdoctoral fellowship. Keaton has since transitioned to faculty and continues to lead the program. To date, the program has had 22 residents from 8 different medical specialties participate. New this academic year was the creation of the Innovation Track. This specialized track is supported by DBMI and focuses on health IT innovation. Resident physicians in the track collaborate with DBMI faculty and students to create a health IT product. There are two participants in the Innovation Track this year. NOTABLE RECOGNITIONS Notable recognition and achievement in the clinical informatics realm over the past year include the following: The ReImagine EHR initiative's Disease Manager SMART on FHIR application won First Place in the AMIA/HL7 FHIR\u00ae Applications Showcase at the AMIA 2021 Annual Meeting. Continued success in securing grants in clinical informatics, including a number of the grants listed in the Research section of the newsletter. 15 INDUSTRY ADVISORY BOARD IABtalks In 2021, we continued to host our IABtalks event virtually in April and in October. The engagement during the presentations continued to be very successful but the opportunity to network and visit with other attendees was sorely missed. We don't know when we'll get back to life as we knew it before the pandemic but hope that we can continue to present interesting and thoughtful presentations to our students, industry and government professionals in the biomedical informatics field. In April, Dr. Benjamin Zaniello, the Chief Medical Officer at Collective Medical presented, \"Healthcare Informatics IRL: Insights, Opportunities, Pitfalls\". In October, Rob Reynolds, COO, and Bryn Rhodes, CTO, both from Alphora, presented, \"HL7\u00ae FHIR\u00ae & Clinical Decision Support\". We were also delighted to hear from our own faculty members, Drs. Ken Kawaoto and Guilherme Del Fiol who discussed their work for the ReImagine EHR initiative at the University of Utah Health. At both events, we heard from a panel of students highlighting their experiences. Growth of the IAB The IAB continues to draw companies and organizations from Utah and nationally. We currently have 31 companies/organizations that partner with our department with several more in the pipeline. They are all enthusiastic supporters of the IAB's mission of building relationships between industry and academics to advance biomedical informatics. 16 This past Spring, the Office of Health Equity, Diversity and Inclusion (OHEDI) in the School of Medicine brought together departmental leadership with the goal of creating a diversity council to build community, coordinate efforts, share best practices and resources, and assist with the implementation of diversity plans across the school. Damian Borbolla and Colleen Kenost are serving as DBMI's representatives on this committee. In an effort to bring EDI to the forefront of our departmental core missions, we have established our own committee to develop departmental best practices around EDI, assist with the implementation of departmental diversity goals, and create a more equitable and inclusive workplace, aligned with the strategic initiatives and missions of DBMI and the University. Current members Ryzen Benson. We are looking forward to advancing departmental EDI efforts in 2022 and welcome any suggestions and ideas to ensure we provide a welcoming environment for all.

Dr. Vawdrey is a worthy recipient!DBMI ALUMNI AWARDS 1718 GOOD NOTES Voices of U of U Health The opportunity to lead the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah almost seems like destiny. The research of medical informatics pioneers and clinicians at the U shaped my career and many others. I am humbled to serve with the best in the field and train the next generation of biomedical informat - icists. Bridging Technology and Medicine My interest in medicine and engineering began at an early age. I started programming at age 13. By the time I was 18, I was a seasoned programmer and had launched my own consulting company. Around this same time, I discovered computers could not reason with medical data. I went on to complete three engineering internships with IBM and calculated that I could make a better living in programming than I could in medicine. However, I saw an opportunity to contribute to computing with the language of medicine and improve health care. While some computer-assisted diagnostic tools existed at that time, they were not available commercially. I decided that pursuing both medicine and engineering would allow me to help bridge this gap. After 17 years of exciting clinical practice\u2014 where I saw what health information systems were capable of\u2014I decided to focus my career entirely on translational informatics, research and development, and leadership. That is where I felt I could have the most impact. Serendipitous Circumstances A number of rare opportunities and chance encounters shaped my path in biomedical informatics. In 1990, while I was a family medicine resident at Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de Sherbrooke in Quebec, Canada, they implemented electronic health records (EHRs). At that time, less than one percent of hospitals in the world operated with EHRs. I had the opportunity to be mentored by Roger C\u00f4t\u00e9, MD, and then, as an editorial board member of the College of American Pathologists, contribute to transforming C\u00f4t\u00e9's nomenclature\u2014Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED)\u2014into electronic form. Now used globally, SNOMED makes it possible for the computer to reason with medical facts. Today, the nomenclature of medicine includes more than 350,000 concepts and continues to grow. When I was hired as a post-doctoral student at Columbia University, the founding chair of the biomedical informatics department was Paul Clayton, PhD. Clayton came from the Department of Biomedical Informatics at the University of Utah, the nation's first biomedical informatics department. At the U, he collaborated on groundbreaking research and development, including the HELP EHR and proving that EHR- anchored clinical decision support tools improve antibiotic therapy outcomes and reduce surgical complications. Clayton created a subculture at Columbia patterned after the innovative, collaborative culture at the U. His primary criteria for those he hired was \"nice, hardworking, and smart.\" To read the full article, please see HERE.The Good Notes blog, managed by the Public Affairs team at University of Utah Health, shares stories about new services, technology, research findings, as well as interesting personalities from across the health care system. In October 2021, Dr. Yves Lussier was asked to share his Biomedical Informatics story (see below). Pioneering a New Era of Biomedical Informatics Damian Borolla, MD, MS A special issue of the International Journal of Medical Informatics on \"Leveraging Data and Information Systems on the Sustainable Development Goals\" was recently published, DBMI faculty Damian Borbolla (Assistant Professor) and David Novillo Ortiz (DBMI Adjunct faculty and World Health Organization, Regional Office for Europe) together with Heimar De Fatima Marin (Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil), Yuri Quintana (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) and John Holmes (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) are the editors. Julio Facelli, PhD Dr. Facelli has been elected to serve on the AMIA Diversity Equity and Inclusion Com - mittee. This committee guides and executes AMIA's strategic goals and objective related to diversity, equity, and inclusion. He has also been selected to serve as a co- Chair on the Retention and Advancement subcommittee. This subcommittee focused on growing a diverse set of AMIA leaders. Ramkiran Gouripeddi, MBBS, MS and Julio Facelli, PhD The National Academy of Medicine awarded a \"Catalyst Phase of the National Academy of Medicine Healthy Longevity Global Competition\" to Drs. Ramkiran Gouripeddi and Julio Facelli for their project that seeks to address the challenge of generating aging exposomes. Their team will evaluate if these aging exposomes will be useful in studying the bidirectional effects of exposures and aging. Kensaku Kawamoto, MD, PhD, MHS, FACMI, FAMIA The Digital Healthcare Research Program at AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) recently highlighted Dr. Ken Kawamoto's research project, \"Decision Precision+: Increasing Lung Cancer Screening for At-Risk Patients\", which was funded by AHRQ for $1,184,380. His research aims to enable widespread implementation of Decision Precision+ to increase lung cancer low-dose computed tomography screenings and help prevent lung cancer deaths. The ReImagine EHR initiative's Disease Manager SMART on FHIR application won First Place in the AMIA/HL7 FHIR\u00ae Applications Showcase at the AMIA 2021 Annual Meeting. Aaron Quinlan, PhD Aaron Quinlan, PhD and his team were awarded a grant through the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) for Essential Open Source Software. Dr. Quinlan's project, \"Improving the Analytical Flexibility of bedtools\" was one of 35 awarded. Biomedical research increasingly relies on computational methods, and open source software has become foundational to the majority of today's research in the field.
