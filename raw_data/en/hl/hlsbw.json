The disease is basically characterized by hurdles in social interaction where the individuals demonstrate repetitive and stereotyped interests or patterns of behavior. A wide number of neuroanatomical studies with autistic patients revealed alterations in brain development which lead to diverse cellular and anatomical processes including atypical neurogenesis, neuronal migration, maturation, differentiation, and degeneration. Special education programs, speech and language therapy, have been employed for the amelioration of behavioral deficits in autism. Although commonly prescribed antidepressants, antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, and stimulants have revealed satisfactory responses in autistic individuals, adverse side effects and increased risk of several other complications including obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, etc. have compelled the researchers to turn their attention toward herbal remedies. Alternative approaches with natural compounds are on continuous clinical trial to confirm their efficacy and to understand their potential in autism treatment. This chapter aims to cover the major plant-based natural products which hold promising outcomes in the field of reliable therapeutic interventions for autism.
