March 2022 6 Version 3.0 Introduction We are honored to present the third edition of the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines and want to thank the entire EMS community for contributing to its evolution. The inaugural edition , released in September 2014, has been warmly welcomed by EMS clinicians, agencies, medical directors, and healthcare organizations in our nation as well as abroad. The creation of this document is a pinnacle event in the practice of EMS medicine as it ful filled a recommendation in The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical Services at the Crossroads published by the Institute of Medicine (now the National Academies of Sciences) in 2007. Specifically, this report states \"NHTSA, in partnership with prof essional organizations, should convene a panel of individuals with multidisciplinary expertise to develop evidence -based model prehospital care protocols for the treatment, triage, and transport of patients.\" The National Association of State EMS Official s (NASEMSO) recognizes the need for national EMS clinical guidelines to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the practice of patient care now and, as experience dictates, the adoption of future practices. The value of EMS clinician s to the patient has no boundaries as magnified by the historic 2019 novel coronavirus pandemic as well as other interjurisdictional and global responses. Model EMS clinical guidelines promote uniformity in EMS medicine which, in turn, fosters a more consi stent skilled practice as EMS clinicians move across healthcare systems. They also provide a standard to EMS medical directors upon which to base practice. Supported by initial and subsequent grant funding from NHTSA 's Office of Emergency Medical Services (OEMS ) and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Maternal and Child Health Bureau's EMS for Children program, NASEMSO continues to authorize its Medical Directors Council to partner with national stakeholder organizations with expertise i n EMS medical direction and subject matter experts to create a unified set of patient care guidelines. For those aspects of clinical care where evidence -based guidelines derived in accordance with the national evidence -based guideline model process were no t available, consensus -based clinical guidelines are developed utilizing current available research . The NASEMSO Model EMS Clinical Guidelines are not mandatory, are not meant to be all -inclusive, nor are they meant to determine local scope of practice. The focus of these guidelines is solely patient -centric. As such, they are designed to provide a resource for EMS clinical practice, appropriate patient care, safety of patients and clinicians, and outcomes regardless of the existing resources and capabilities within an EMS system. This document provides a clinical standard that can be used as is or adapted for use on a state, regional, local, or organizational level to enhance patient care and to se t benchmark performance of EMS practice. The Guidelines should be adapted to align with federal, state, regional, and jurisdictional laws and regulations. NASEMSO's ongoing support of this project underlines the critical evolution of the model EMS clinical guidelines as new EMS research and evidence -based patient care measures emerge. We are most grateful to be able to partner with a group of talented, committed individuals in this worthwhile endeavor. Carol Cunningham, M.D. Richard Kamin, M.D. Co-Principal Investigator Co-Principal Investigator NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines Rev. March 2022 7 Version 3.0 Purpose and Notes These guidelines are intended to help state EMS systems ensure a more standardized approach to the practice of patient care, and to encompass evidence -based guidelines (EBG) as they are developed. The long -term goal is to develop a full range of evidence -based clinical guidelines for the practice of EMS medicine . However, until there is a sufficient body of evidence to fully support this goal, there is a need for this interim expert, consensus -based step. The National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines can fill a significant gap in uniform clinical guidance for EMS patient care, while also providing input to the evidence -based guideline (EBG) development process. These guidelines will be maintained by the Medical Directors Council of the National Association of State EMS Officials (NASEMSO) and will be reviewed and updated periodically. As EBG material is developed, it will be substituted for the consensus -based guidelines now comprising the majority of the content of this document . In the interim, additional consensus -based guidelines will also be ad ded as the need is identified . For guidelines to be considered for inclusion, they must be presented in the format followed by all guidelines in the document. Universal Care and Poisoning/Overdose Universal Care guidelines are included to reduce the need f or extensive reiteration of basic assessment and other considerations in every guideline. The appendices contain material such as neurologic status assessment and burn assessment tools to which many guidelines refer to increase consistency in internal standardization and to reduce duplication. While some specific guidelines have been included for pediatric patients, considerations of patient age and size (pediatric, geriatric, and bariatric) have been interwoven in the guidelines throughout the document. Where IV access and drug routing are specified, it is intended to include IO access and drug routing when IV access and drug routing is not possible. Generic medication names are utilized throughout the guidelines. A complete list of these, alon g with respective brand names, may be found in Appendix III . \"Medications\". Accurate and quality data collection is crucial to the advancement of EMS and a critical element of EMS research . The National EMS Information System (NEMSIS) has the unique abilit y to unify EMS data on a national scope to fulfill this need . Each guideline, therefore, is also listed by the closest NEMSIS Version 3 Label and Code corresponding to it, listed in parentheses below the guideline name. Quality assurance (QA) and/or contin ued performance improvement (CPI) programs are an indispensable element of medical direction as they facilitate the identification of gaps and potential avenues of their resolution within an EMS system . The National EMS Quality Alliance ( NEMSQA ) Performanc e Measures is a resource for these programs. This edition of the NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines incorporates many of the NEMSQA performance measures into the key performance measures associated with each clinical guideline. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines Rev. March 2022 8 Version 3.0 Target Audience While this material is intended to be integrated into an EMS system's operational guidance materials by its medical director and other leaders, it is written with the intention that it will be consumed by field EMS clinicians . To the degree possible, it has been assembled in a format useful for guidance and quick reference so that leaders may adopt it in wh ole or in part, harvesting and integrating as they deem appropriate to the format of their guideline, protocol, or procedure materials. Any set of guidelines must determine a balance between education and patient care. This document purposefully focuses on the patient care aspect of EMS response . This does not preclude the individual medical director from using these guidelines and including additional education as well as incorporation of state, local, or jurisdictional operational procedures . What is New in the 2022 Edition All of the 2017 guidelines have been reviewed and updated, and additional guidelines and new evidence - based guidelines have been added to this edition . While some of the new material has been added as guidelines in the appropriate c hapter, other topics have been incorporated into a previously existing guideline . New guidelines have been added to the 2022 edition for the following clinical conditions or scenarios: Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) & Acute Events in Infants Resuscitation in Traumatic Cardiac Arrest Tracheostomy Management Trauma Mass Casualty Incident In addition, with the permission and assistance of the American College of Surgeons - Committee on Trauma, we have included the 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients as Appendix IX. Acknowledgements The authors of this document are NASEMSO Medical Director Council members partnered with representatives of seven EMS medical director stakeholder organizations . The stakeholder organizations are the American Academy of Eme rgency Medicine (AAEM), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP), the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS-COT), the Air Medical Physician Association (AMPA), and the National Association of EMS Physicians (NAEMSP). In honor and gratitude, the authors of the inaugural NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines are also included . Their invaluable contri butions and expertise to build the foundation of this evolutionary document will always be deeply respected and appreciated.

Request additional resources if needed and weigh the benefits of waiting for additional resources against rapid transport to definitive care f. Consider declaration of mass casualty incident if needed 2. Use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) a. Consider suspected or confirmed hazards on scene b. Consider suspected or confirmed highly contagious infe ctious disease (e.g., contact [bodily high -visibility, retro -reflective apparel when deemed appropriate ( e.g., operations at night or in darkness, on or near roadways) 4. Consider cervical spine stabilization and/or spinal care if traumatic injury suspected . [See Spine Care Guideline ] 5. Primary survey (Airway , Breathing, Circulation ( ABC ) is cited below; although there are specific circumstances where Circulation, Airway, Breathing ( CAB ) may be indicated, such as for cardiac arrest, or Massive hemorrhage, Airway, Respirations, Circulation, Hypothermia and head injury ( MARCH ) may be indicated for trauma or major arterial bleeding) NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev. March 2022 Universal Care Guideline 10 Version 3.0 a. Airway (assess for patency and open the airway as indicated) - go to Airway Management Guideline i. Patient is unable to maintain airway patency \u2014open airway 1. Head tilt /chin lift 2. Jaw thrust 3. Suction 4. Consider use of the appropriate airway management adjuncts and devices: oral airway, nasal airway, supraglottic airway device or endotracheal tube 5. For patients with laryngectomies or tracheostomies, remove all objects or clothing that may obstruct the opening of these devices , maintain the flow of prescribed oxygen, and reposition the head and/or neck b. Breathing i. Evaluate rate, breath sounds, accessory muscle use, retractions, patient positioning, oxygen saturation ii. Provide supplemental oxygen as appropriate to achieve the target of 94-98% oxygen saturation (S PO2) based upon clinical presentation and assessment of ventilation (e.g., EtCO 2) iii. Apnea (not breathing) - go to Airway Management Guideline c. Circulation i. Control any major external bleeding [ See General Trauma Management Guideline and/or Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management Guideline ] ii. Assess pulse 1. If none - go to Resuscitation Section 2. Assess rate and quality of carotid and radial pulses iii. Evaluate perfusion by assessing skin color and temperature 1. Evaluate capillary refill d. Disability i. Evaluate patient responsiveness: AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) ii. Evaluate gross motor and sensory function in all extremities iii. Check blood glucose in patients with altered mental status (AMS) or suspected stroke . If blood glucose is less than 60 mg/dL - go to Hypoglycemia Guideline iv. If acute stroke suspected - go to Suspected Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack Guideline e. Expose patient for exam as appropriate to complaint i. Be considerate of patient modesty ii. Keep patient warm 6. Assess for urgency of transport 7. Secondary survey The performance of the secondary survey should not delay transport in critical patients. See also secondary survey specific to individual complaints in other protocols. Secondary surveys should be tailored to patient presentation and chief complaint. The following are suggested considerations for secondary survey assessment: a. Head i. Pupils ii. Ears iii. Naso -oropharynx iv. Skull and scalp NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev. March 2022 Universal Care Guideline 11 Version 3.0 b. Neck i. Jugular venous distension ii. Tracheal position iii. Spinal tenderness c. Chest i. Retractions ii. Breath sounds iii. Chest wall tenderness, deformity, crepitus, and excursion iv. Respiratory pattern, symmetry of chest movement with respiration d. Abdomen/Back i. Tenderness or bruising ii. Abdominal distension, rebound, or guarding iii. Spinal tenderness, crepitus, or step -offs iv. Pelvic stability or tenderness e. Extremities i. Pulses ii. Edema iii. Deformity/crepitus f. Neurologic i. Mental status/orientation ii. Motor/sensory g. Evaluate for medical equipment (e.g., pacemaker/defibrillator, left ventricular assist device (LVAD), insulin pump, dialysis fistula) 8. Obtain baseline vital signs ( an initial full set of vital signs is required: pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessmen t and obtain pulse oximetry if indicated) a. Neurologic status assessment [ See Appendix VII. Neurologic Status Assessment ] involves establishing a baseline and then trending any change in patient neurologic status i. Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is frequently used, but there are often errors in applying and calculating this score. With this in consideration, a more simple field approach may be as valid as GCS. Either AVPU or only the motor component of the GCS may more effectively serve in this capacity ii. Sternal rub as a stimulus is discouraged b. Patients with cardiac or respiratory complaints i. Pulse oximetry ii. 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) should be obtained promptly in patients with cardiac or suspected cardiac complaints iii. Continuous cardiac monitoring, if available iv. Consider waveform capnography for patients with respiratory complaints (essential for critical patients and those patients who require invasive airway management) c. Patient with altered mental status i. Check blood glu cose . If low , go to Hypoglycemia Guideline ii. Consider waveform capnography (essential for critical patients and those patients who require invasive airway management) or digital capnometry d. Stable patients should have at least two sets of pertinent vital signs. Ideally, one set should be taken shortly before arrival at receiving facility e. Critical patients should have pertinent vital signs frequently monitored NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev. March 2022 Universal Care Guideline 12 Version 3.0 9. Obtain OPQRST history: a. Onset of symptoms b. Provocation : location ; any exacerbating or alleviating factors c. Quality of pain d. Radiation of pain e. Severity of symptoms : pain scale f. Time of onset and circumstances around onset 10. Obtain SAMPLE history: a. Symptoms b. Allergies : medication, environmental, and foods c. Medications : prescription and over the counter; bring containers to ED if possible d. Past medical history i. Look for medical alert tags, portable medical records, advance directives ii. Look for medical devices/implants (some common ones may be dialysis shunt, insulin pump, pacemaker, central venous access port, gastric tubes, urinary catheter) iii. For females of childbearing age, inquire of potential or recent pregnancy. e. Last oral intake f. Events leading up to the 911 call In patients with syncope, seizure, altered mental status, or acute stroke, consider bringing the witness to the hospital or obtain their contact phone number to provide to ED care team Treatment and Interventions 1. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a targe t of achieving 9 4-98% saturation and select the appropriate method of oxygen delivery to mitigate or treat hypercarbia associated with hypoventilation 2. Place appropriate monitoring equipment as dictated by assessment; these may include: a. Continuous pulse oxi metry b. Cardiac rhythm monitoring c. Waveform capnography or digital capnometry d. Carbon monoxide assessment 3. Establish vascular access if indicated or in patients who are at risk for clinical deterioration. a. If IO is to be used for a conscious patient, consider the use of 0.5 mg/kg of lidocaine 0.1 mg/mL with slow push through IO needle to a maximum of 40 mg to m itigate pain from IO medication administration 4. Monitor pain scale if appropriate 5. Monitor agitation -sedation scale if appropriate 6. Reassess patient Transfer of Care 1. The content and quality of information provided during the transfer of patient care to another party is critical for seamless patient care and maintenance of patient safety 2. Ideally, a completed electronic or written medical record should be provided to the next caregiver at the time of transfer of care NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev. March 2022 Universal Care Guideline 13 Version 3.0 3. If provision of the completed medical reco rd is not possible at the time of transfer of care, a verbal report and an abbreviated written run report should be provided to the next caregiver 4. The information provided during the transfer of care should include, but is not limited to, a. Patient's full na me b. Age c. Chief complaint d. History of present illness/Mechanism of injury e. Past medical history f. Medications g. Allergies h. Vital signs with documented times i. Patient assessment and interventions along with the timing of any medication or intervention and the patien t's response to such interventions 5. The verbal or abbreviated written run report provided at the time of transfer of care does not take the place of or negate the requirement for the provision of a complete electronic or written medical record of the care p rovided by EMS personnel Patient Safety Considerations 1. Routine use of lights and sirens is not warranted 2. Even when lights and sirens are in use, always limit speeds to level that is safe for the emergency vehicle being driven and road conditions on which it is being operated 3. Be aware of legal issues and patient rights as they pertain to and impact patient care ( e.g., patients with functional needs or children with special healthcare needs) 4. Be aware of potential need to adjust management based on pati ent age and comorbidities, including medication dosages 5. The maximum weight -based dose of medication administered to a pediatric patient should not exceed the maximum adult dose except where specifically stated in a patient care guideline 6. Medical direction should be contacted when mandated or as needed 7. Consider air medical transport, if available, for patients with time -critical conditions where ground transport time exceeds 30 minutes Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Pediatrics : use a weight -based assessment tool (length -based tape or other system) to estimate patient weight and guide medication therapy and adjunct choice a. Although the defined age varies by state, the pediatric population is generally defined by those patients who weigh up to 40 kg or up to 14 years of age , whichever comes first b. Consider using the pediatric assessment triangle (appearance, work of breathing, circulation) when first approaching a child to help with assessment 2. Geriatrics : although the defined age varies by state, th e geriatric population is generally defined as those patients who are 65 years old or more a. In these patients, as well as all adult patients, reduced medication dosages may apply to patients with renal disease ( i.e., on dialysis or a diagnosis of chronic re nal insufficiency) or hepatic disease (i.e. , severe cirrhosis or end -stage liver disease) NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev. March 2022 Universal Care Guideline 14 Version 3.0 3. Co-morbidities : reduced medication dosages may apply to patients with renal disease ( i.e., on dialysis or a diagnosis of chronic renal insufficiency) or hepatic disease ( i.e., severe cirrhosis or end-stage liver disease) 4. Vital Signs : a. Oxygen i. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 9 4-98% saturation ii. Supplemental oxygen admini stration is warranted to patients with oxygen saturations below this level and titrated based upon clinical condition, clinical response, and geographic location and altitude iii. The method of oxygen delivery should minimize or treat hypercarbia associated with hypoventilation (e.g., non -invasive positive airway pressure devices) b. Normal vital signs (See Table 1. Normal Vital Signs ) i. Hypotension is considered a systolic blood pressure less than the lower limit on the chart ii. Tachycardia is considered a pulse above the upper limit on the chart iii. Bradycardia is considered a pulse below the lower limit on the chart iv. Tachypnea is considered a respiratory rate above the upper limit on the chart v. Bradypnea is considered a respiratory rate below the lower limit on the chart c. Hypertension. Although abnormal, may be an expected finding in many patients i. Unless an intervention is specifically suggested based on the patient's complaint or presentation, the hypertension should be documented, but otherwise, no intervention should be taken acutely to normalize the blood pressure ii. The occurrence of symptoms ( e.g., chest pain, dyspnea, vision change, headache, focal weakness or change in sensation, altered mental status) in patients with hypertension should be considered concerning, and care should be provided appropriate with the patient's complaint or presentation 5. Secondary S urvey : if patient has critical primary survey problems, it may not be possible to complete 6. Critical Patients : proactive patient management should occur simultaneously with assessment a. Ideally, one clinician should be assigned to exclusively mon itor and facilitate patient - focused care b. Other than lifesaving interventions that prevent deterioration en route, t reatment and Interventions should be initiated as soon as practical, but should not impede extrication or delay transport to definitive care 7. Air Medical Transport : air transport of trauma patients should generally be reserved for higher acuity trauma patients where there is a significant time sav ed over ground transport, where the appropriate destination is not accessible by ground due to syste mic or logistical issues, and for patients who meet the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma (ACS -COT) 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients anatomic, physiologic, a nd situational high -acuity triage criteria . In selected circumstances, air medical resources may be helpful for non-trauma care (e.g., stroke, STEMI when geographically constrained) 8. Additional Protective Measures for the EMS Clinician: Due to suspected or con firmed hazards and/or highly infectious contagious diseases, traditional patient treatment and care delivery may be altered due to recommendations by federal, state, local or jurisdictional officials NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev.

According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, this includes, but is not limited to, individuals with physical, sensory, mental health, and cognitive and/or intellectual disabilities affecting their ability to function independently without assistance Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Management Assessment 1. Identify the functional need by means of information from the patient, the patient's family, bystanders, medic alert bracelets or documents, or the patient's adjunct assistance devices 2. The physical examination should not be intentionally abbreviated, although the way the exam is performed may need to be modified to accommodate the specific needs of the patient Treatmen t and Interventions Medical care should not intentionally be reduced or abbreviated during the triage, treatment, and transport of patients with functional needs, although the way the care is provided may need to be modified to accommodate the specific ne eds of the patient Patient Safety Considerations For patients with communication barriers (language or sensory), it may be desirable to obtain secondary confirmation of pertinent data ( e.g., allergies) from the patient's family, interpreters, or written or electronic medical records. The family members can be an excellent source of information and the presence of a family member can have a calming influence on some of these patients NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev. March 2022 Functional Needs 20 Version 3.0 Notes/Ed ucational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Communication Barriers a. Language Barriers: i. Expressive and/or receptive aphasia ii. Nonverbal iii. Fluency in a different language than that of the EMS professional iv. Examples of tools to overcome language barriers include: 1. Transport of an individual who is fluent in the patient's language along with the patient to the hospital 2. Medical translation cards 3. Telephone -accessible services with live language interpreters 4. Methods through which the patient augments his/her communicat ion skills ( e.g., eye blinking, nodding) should be noted, utilized as able, and communicated to the receiving facility 5. Electronic applications for translation b. Sensory Barriers: i. Visual impairment ii. Auditory impairment iii. Examples of tools to overcome sensory b arriers include: 1. Braille communication card 2. Sign language 3. Lip reading 4. Hearing aids 5. Written communication 2. Physical Barriers: a. Ambulatory impairment ( e.g., limb amputation, bariatric) b.

Services animals are not classified as a pet and sho uld, by law, always be permitted to accompany the patient with the following exceptions: i. A public entity may ask an individual with a disability to remove a service animal from the premises if: 1. The animal is out of control and the animal's handler does not take effective action to control it; or 2. The animal is not housebroken b. Service animals are not required to wear a vest or a leash. It is illegal to make a request for special identification or documentation from the service animal's partner. EMS clinician s may only ask the patient if the service animal is required because of a disability and the form of assistance the animal has been trained to perform. c. EMS clinician s are not responsible for the care of the service animal. If the patient is incapacitated a nd cannot personally care for the service animal, a decision can be made whether to transport the animal in this situation. d.

March 2022 Patient Refusals 23 Version 3.0 Patient Refusals Aliases Against medical advice Refusal of treatment Refusal of transport Patient Care Goals/Patient Presentation (Overview) If an individual (or the parent or legal guardian of the individual) refuses secondary care and/or ambulance transport to a hospital after prehospital clinician s have been called to the scene, clinician s should determine the patient's capacity to make deci sions. Competency is generally a legal status of a person's ability to make decisions. However, state laws vary in the definition of competency and its impact upon authority. Therefore, one should consult with the respective state EMS office for clarificat ion on legal definitions and patient rights . Patient Management Assessment 1. Decision -Making Capacity a. An individual who is alert, oriented, and can understand the circumstances surrounding his/her illness or impairment, as well as the possible risks associated with refusing treatment and/or transport, typically is considered to have decision -making capacity b. The individual's judgment must also not be significantly impaired by illness, injury, or drugs/alcohol intoxication. Individuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal intent, or had other factors that lead EMS clinician s to suspect suicidal intent, should not be regarded as having decisio n-making capacity and may not decline transport to a medical facility Treatment and Interventions 1. Obtain a complete set of vital signs and complete an initial assessment, paying particular attention to the individual's neurologic and mental status 2. Determi ne the individual's capacity to make a valid judgment concerning the extent of his/her illness or injury; if the EMS clinician has doubts about whether the individual has the mental capacity to refuse or if the patient lacks capacity, the EMS clinician should contact medical direction 3. If patient has capacity, clearly explain to the individual and all responsible parties the possible risks and overall concerns with regards to refusing care and that they may reengage the EMS system if needed 4. Perform appropria te medical care with the consent of the individual 5. Complete the patient care report clearly documenting the initial assessment findings and the discussions with all involved individuals regarding the possible consequences of refusing additional prehospital care and/or transportation Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. An adult or emancipated minor who has demonstrated possessing sufficient mental capacity for making decisions has the right to determine the course of his/her medical care, including the refusal of care NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev. March 2022 Patient Refusals 24 Version 3.0 2. Individuals must be advised of the risks and consequences resulting from refusal of medical care to enable an informed decision regarding consent or refusal of treatment 3. An individual determined to lack decision -making capacit y by EMS clinician s should not be allowed to refuse care against medical advice or to be released at the scene. Mental illness, drugs, alcohol intoxication, or physical/mental impairment may significantly impair an individual's decision -making capacity. In dividuals who have attempted suicide, verbalized suicidal intent, or had other factors that lead EMS clinician s to suspect suicidal intent, should not be regarded as having demonstrated sufficient decision -making capacity 4. The determination of decision -maki ng capacity may be challenged by communication barriers or cultural differences 5. EMS clinician s should not put themselves in danger by attempting to treat and/or transport an individual who refuses care . Law enforcement personnel should be requested if needed 6. Always act in the best interest of the patient . EMS clinician s, with the support of direct medical oversight, must strike a balance between abandoning the patient and forcing care 7. Special Considerations - Minors It is preferable for min ors to have a parent or legal guardian who can provide consent for treatment on behalf of the child a. All states allow healthcare clinician s to provide emergency treatment when a parent is not available to provide consent. This is known as the emergency exception rule or the doctrine of implied consent. For minors, this doctrine means that the EMS clinician can presume consent and proceed wit h appropriate treatment and transport if the following six conditions are met: i. The child is suffering from an emergent condition that places their life or health in danger ii. The child's legal guardian is unavailable or unable to provide consent for treatment or transport iii. Treatment or transport cannot be safely delayed until consent can be obtained iv. The EMS clinician administers only treatment for emergency conditions that pose an immediate threat to the child v. As a rule , when the EMS clinician 's authority to ac t is in doubt, EMS clinician s should always do what they believe to be in the best interest of the minor vi. If a minor is injured or ill and no parent contact is possible, the EMS clinician may contact medical direction for additional instructions Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914189 - General - Refusal of Care Key Documentation Elements Document p atient capacity with: o All barriers to patient care in the NEMSIS element \"eHistory.01 \u2014Barriers to Patient Care\" (a Required National Element of NEMSIS) o Exam fields \"eExam.19 \u2014Mental Status\" and \"eExam.20 \u2014Neurological Assessment\" o Vitals for level of responsiveness and Glasgow Coma Scale o Alcohol and drug use indicators NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Universal Care Rev.

Stabilize and resuscitate when necessary 2. Initiate monitoring and diagnostic procedures 3. Transfer for further evaluation Patient Presentation 1. Syncope is heralded by both the loss of consciousness and the loss of postural tone and resolves spontaneously without medical interventions. Syncope typically is abrupt in onset and resolves equally quickly. EMS clinician s may find the patient awake and alert on initial evaluation 2. Near syncope is defined as the prodromal symptoms of syncope. The symptoms that can precede syncope last for seconds to minutes with signs and symptoms that may include pallor, sweating, lightheadedness, visual changes, or weakness. It may be described by the patient as \"nearly blacking out\" or \"nearly fainting\" . 3. Rapid first aid during th e onset may improve symptoms and prevent syncope Inclusion Criteria 1. Abrupt loss of consciousness with loss of postural tone 2. Prodromal symptoms of syncope Exclusion Criteria Conditions other than the above, including: 1. Patients with alternate and obvious cause of loss of consciousness (e.g. , trauma - See Head Injury Guideline ) 2. Patients with ongoing mental status changes or coma should be treated per the Altered Mental Status Guideline 3. Patients with persistent new neurologic deficit [See Suspected Stroke/Transient Ischemic Attack Guideline ] Patient Management Assessment 1. Pertinent History a. Review the patient's past medical history including a history of: i. Cardiovascular disease (e.g. , cardiac disease/stroke, valvular disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral valve prolapse) ii.

Conditions leading to the event: after transition from recumbent/sitting to standing; occurring with strenuous exercise (notably in the young and seemingly healthy) 1. Syncope that occurs during exercise often indicates an ominous cardiac cause. Patients should be evaluated in the emergency depar tment ii. Patient complaints before or after the event including prodromal symptoms iii. History of symptoms described by others on scene, including seizures or shaking, presence of pulse/breathing (if noted), duration of the event, events that lead to the resolution of the event c.

Heart, lung, abdominal , and extremity exam v. Additional Evaluation: 1. Cardiac monitoring 2. Oxygen saturation (SPO 2) 3. Ongoing vital signs 4. 12-lead EKG 5. Blood glucose level (BGL) Treatment and Interventions : 1. Should be directed at abnormalities discovered in the physical exam or on additional examination and may include management of cardiac dysrhythmias, cardiac ischemia/infarct, hemorrhage, shock, etc. a. Manage airway as indicated b. Oxygen as appropriate c. Evalu ate for hemorrhage and treat for shock if indicated d. Establish IV access e. Fluid bolus if appropriate f. Cardiac monitor g. 12-lead EKG h. Monitor for and treat arrhythmias (if present , refer to appropriate guideline) NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Cardiovascular Rev. March 2022 Adult and Pediatric Syncope and Near Syncope 28 Version 3.0 Patient Safety Considerations : 1. Patients suffering from syncope due to arrhythmia may experience recurrent arrhythmias and should therefore be placed on a cardiac monitor 2. Geriatric patients suffering falls from standing may sustain significant injury and should be diligently screened for trauma . [General Trauma Management Guideline ] Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. By being most proximate to the scene and to the patient's presentation, EMS clinician s are commonly in a unique position to identify the cause of syncope. Consideration of potential causes, ongoing monitoring of vitals and cardiac rhythm and detailed exam and history are essential pieces of information to pass on to hospital clinician s 2. For patients where a lower risk etiology is suspected, e.g., vasovagal syncope, decisions regarding delayed or non -transport should be made in consultation with medical dire ction 3. High -risk causes of syncope include , but are not limited to, the following: a. Cardiovascular i. Myocardial infarction ii. Aortic stenosis iii. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (consider in patient with unexplained syncope during exertion) iv. Pulmonary embolus v. Aortic dissection vi. Dysrhythmia vii. Mitral valve prolapse is associated with higher risk for sudden death b. Neurovascular i. Intracranial hemorrhage ii. Transient ischemic attack or stroke Vertebral basilar insufficiency c. Hemorrhagic i. Ruptured e ctopic pregnancy ii. GI bleed iii. Aortic rupture 4. Consider high -risk 12-lead EKG features including, but not limited to: a. Evidence of QT prolongation (generally over 500 msec) b. Delta waves c. Brugada syndrome (incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB ) pattern in V1/V2 with ST segment elevation) d. Hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. 12-lead EKG findings 2. Evidence of alternate etiology, including seizure 3.

Activate hospital -based STEMI system of care 4. Monitor vital signs and cardiac rhythm and be prepared to provide CPR and defibrillation if needed 5. Administer appropriate medications 6. Transport to appropriate facility Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Chest pain or discomfort in other areas of the body (e.g. , arm, jaw, epigastrium) of suspected cardiac origin, shortness of breath, associated or unexplained sweating, nausea, vomiting, or dizziness. Atypical or unusual symptoms are more common in women, t he elderly , and diabetic patients. May also present with CHF, syncope , and/or shock 2. Chest pain associated sympathomimeti c use (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine) 3. Some patients will present with likely non -cardiac chest pain and otherwise have a low likelihood of ACS ( e.g., blunt trauma to the chest of a child). For these patients, defer the administration of aspirin (ASA) and nitrates per the Pain Management Guideline Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Management Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions 1. Signs and symptoms include chest pain, congestive heart failure (CHF) , syncope, shock, symptoms similar to a patient's previous MI 2. Assess the patient's cardiac rhythm and immediately address pulseless rhythms, symptomatic tachycardia, or symptomatic bradycardia [ See Cardiovascular Section and Resuscitation Section ] 3. If the patient is dyspneic, hypoxemic, or has obvious signs of heart failure, EMS clinician s should administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 9 4-98% saturation [Refer to Universal Care Guideli ne] 4. The 12 -lead EKG is the primary diagnostic tool that identifies a STEMI; it is imperative that EMS clinician s routinely acquire a 12 -lead EKG within 10 minutes for all patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of ACS NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Cardiovascular Rev. March 2022 Syndrome (ACS)/ST -segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) 32 Version 3.0 a. The EKG may be transmitted for remote interpretation by a physician or screened for STEMI by properly trained EMS clinician s or other healthcare providers with or without the assistance of computer -interpretation b. Advance notification should be provided to the receiving hospital for patients identified as having a STEMI c. Performance of serial EKGs is encouraged for symptomatic patients with EKGs initially non - diagnostic for STEMI d. All EKGs should be made available to treating personnel at the receiving hospital, whether hand delivered as hard copy or transmitted from the field 5. Administer aspirin; chewable, non -enteric -coated aspirin preferred (162 -325 mg) 6. Establish IV access 7. Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual (SL) , can repeat q (quaque, every) 3-5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg a. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the past 48 hours for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol (Flolan\u00ae) or treporstenil (Remo dulin\u00ae) which is used for pulmonary hypertension c. Care should always be taken when giving nitroglycerin when the patient's blood pressure is marginal. If used in this setting , the clinician should weigh the risk and benefit of nitrate administration over the administration of an opiate analgesic and be ready to respond to hypotension with fluid bolus or pressor 8. The location of the infarct does not preclude the use of nitrates. Right -sided leads are of no additional value if an inferior STEMI has been diagn osed and such findings (presumed RV infarct) do not preclude the use of nitroglycerin : however, continually monitor the patient's hemodynamic status and be prepared to resuscitate if hypotension occurs 9. If the pain is unresponsive to nitrates , opiates are an acceptable alternative . Morphine should be used with caution in unstable angina (UA)/non -STEMI due to an association with increased mortality 10. Transport and destination decisions should be based on local resources and system of care 11. Early notification to receiving facility of any changes in patient condition or serial EKGs Patient Safety Considerations 1. Observe for signs of clinical deterioration: dysrhythmias, chest pain , shortness of breath , decreased level of consciousness /syncope, or other signs of shock/hypotension 2. Perform serial 12 -lead EKGs (especially if clinical changes are noted) 3. Consider placing defibrillator pads on high -risk patients 4. Consider configuring monitor/defibrillator to allow automatic VT/VF alert 5. Consider configuring monitor/defibrillator to allow ST -segment trending if available Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations Acute coronary syndrome may present with atypical pain, vague or only generalized complaints.

Also consider atropine 0.01 -0.02 mg/kg IV with minimum dose of 0.1 mg if increased vagal tone or cholinergic drug toxicity to maximum initial dose of 0.5 mg (maximum total dose of 3 mg ) iii. Transcutaneous pacing : If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control iv. Epinephrine may be used for bradycardia and poor perfusion unresponsive to ventilation and oxygenation 1. It is reasonable to administer atropine for bradycardia caused by increased vagal tone or cholinergic drug toxicity Patient Safety Considerations If pacing is performed, consider sedation or pain control NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Cardiovascular Rev. March 2022 Bradycardia 37 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Observe for signs of decreased end -organ perfusion: chest pain (CP), shortness of breath (SOB), decreased level of consciousness, syncope, or other signs of shock/hy potension 2. Patients who have undergone cardiac transplant will not respond to atropine 3. Consider potential culprit medications including beta -blockers, calcium channel blockers, sodium channel blockers/anti -depressants, digoxin, and clonidine a. If medication overdose is considered, refer to appropriate guideline in the Toxins and Environmental Section 4. The differential diagnosis includes the following: myocardial infarction (MI) , hypoxia , pacemaker with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) , stroke , spinal cord lesion, sick sinus syndrome, AV blocks, overdose, cholinergic nerve agents 5. Consider hyperkalemia in the patient with wide complex bradycardia 6. Bradycardia should be managed via the least invasive manner possible, escalating care as needed a. Third -degree heart block or the denervated heart (as in cardiac transplant) may not respond to atropine and in these cases, proceed quickly to chronotropic agents (such as epinephrine or dopamine) or transcutaneous pacing b. Dopamine is not indicated for pediatric patients c. In cases of impending hemodynamic collapse, proceed directly to transcutaneous pacing d. For shock that is sus pected to be from sepsis, norepinephrine is preferred over dopamine due to its reduced risk of arrhythmias and its lower mortality rate 7. Be aware of acute coronary syndrome as a cause of bradycardia in adult patients 8. When dosing medications for pediatric patients, dose should be weight -based for non -obese patients and based on ideal body weight for obese patients 9. Although dopamine is often recommended for the treatment of symptomatic bradycardia, recent research suggests that patients in cardiog enic or septic shock treated with norepinephrine have a lower mortality rate compared to those treated with dopamine 10.

Rapid identification of, and intervention s for, cardiovascular compromise in patients with VADs 2. Rapid identification of, and interventions for , VAD -related malfunctions or complications Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1. Adult patients that have had an implantable ventricular assist device (VAD), including a left ventricular assist (LVAD), right ventricular assist device (RVAD), or biventricular -assist device (BiVAD) and have symptoms of cardiovascular compromise 2. Patients with VADs that are in cardiac arrest 3. Patients with VADs that are experiencing a medical or injury -related event not involving the cardiovascular system or VAD malfunction Exclusion Criteria Adult patients who do not have a VAD in place Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess for possible pump malfunction a. Assess for alarms b. Auscultate for pump sound \"hum\" c. Signs of hypoperfusion including pallor, diaphoresis, altered mental status 2. If the VAD pump has malfunctioned: a. Utilize available resources to troubleshoot potential VAD malfunctions and to determine appropriate co rrective actions to restore normal VAD function: i. Contact the patient's VAD -trained companion, if available ii. Contact the patient's VAD coordinator, using the phone number on the device iii. Check all the connections to system controller iv. Change VAD batteries, and/ or change system controller if indicated v. Have patient stop all activity and assess for patient tolerance vi. Follow appropriate cardiovascular condition -specific protocol(s) as indicated Treatment and Interventions 1. Manage airway as indicated 2. Cardiac monitoring 3. IV access 4. Acquire 12 -lead EKG NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC Cardiovascular Rev. March 2022 Implantable Ventricular Assist Devices 40 Version 3.0 5. If patient is experiencing VAD -related complications or cardiovascular problems, expedite transport to the medical facility where VAD was placed if patient's clinical condition and time allows 6. If patient has a funct ioning VAD and is experiencing a non -cardiovascular -related problem, transport to a facility that is appropriate for the patient's main presenting problem without manipulating the device 7. If patient has a functioning VAD and is hypoperfus ed: a. Administer IV fluids (30 mL/kg isotonic fluid; maximum of 1 liter) over less than 15 minutes, using a push -pull method of drawing up the fluid in a syringe and pushing it through the IV b. May repeat up to 3 times based on patient's condition and clinical imp ression for a total cumulative dose not to exceed 3 L 8. If patient is in full cardiac arrest: a. CPR should not be performed if there is any evidence the pump is still functioning . The decision whether to perform CPR should be made based upon best clinical judg ment in consultation with the patient's VAD -trained companion and the VAD coordinator (or direct medical oversight if VAD coordinator unavailable) b. CPR may be initiated only where: i. You have confirmed the pump has stopped and troubleshooting efforts to rest art it have failed, and ii. The patient is unresponsive and has no detectable signs of life Notes/Educational Pearls 1. You do not need to disconnect the controller or batteries to: a. Defibrillate or cardiovert b. Acquire a 12 -lead EKG 2. Automatic non-invasive cuff blood pressures may be difficult to obtain due to the narrow pulse pressure created by the continuous flow pump 3. Flow though many VAD devices is not pulsatile, and patients may not have a palpable pulse or accurate pulse oximetry 4. The bloo d pressure, if measurable, may not be an accurate measure of perfusion 5. Ventricular fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, or asystole/PEA may be the patient's \"normal\" underlying rhythm. Evaluate clinical condition and provide care in consultation with VAD coordinator 6. The patient's travel bag should always accompany them with back -up controller and spare batteries 7. If feasible, bring the patient's power module, cable, and display module to the hospital 8. All patients should carry a spare pump controller with t hem 9. The most common cause for VAD alarms is low batteries or battery failures 10. Although automatic non -invasive blood pressure cuffs are often ineffective in measuring systolic and diastolic pressure, if they do obtain a measurement, the MAP is usually accur ate 11. Other VAD complications: a. Infection b. Stroke/ Transient ischemic attack ( TIA) c. Bleeding d. Arrhythmias e.

A-FIB rarely requires cardioversion in the field. As it is difficult to ascertain the onset of this rhythm, the risk of stroke needs to be considered prior to cardioversion 3. A wide -complex irregular rhythm should be considered pre -excited A-FIB; extreme care must be taken in these patients a. Characteristic EKG findings include a short PR interval and, in some cases, a delta wave b. Avoid AV nodal b locking agents such as adenosine, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, and possibly beta -blockers in patients with pre (e.g. , Wolff -Parkinson -White Syndrome, Lown -Ganong -Levine Syndrome) because these drugs may cause a paradoxical increase i n the ventricular response c. Blocking the AV node in some of these patients may lead to impulses that are transmitted exclusively down the accessory pathway, which can result in ventricular fibrillation d. Amiodarone or procainamide may be used as an alternativ e 4. Amiodarone or procainamide can be used as a rate -controlling agent for patients who are intolerant of or unresponsive to other agents, such as patients with CHF who may not otherwise tolerate diltiazem or metoprolol a. Caution should be exercised in those w ho are not receiving anticoagulation, as amiodarone can promote cardioversion 5. Administer metoprolol to patients with SBP greater than 120 mmHg a. Worsening CHF, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , asthma, as well as hypotension and bradycardia can occur with use of metoprolol 6. Biphasic waveforms have been proven to convert A-FIB at lower energies and higher rates of success than monophasic waveforms a. Strategies include dose escalation (70, 120, 150, 170 joules ( J) for biphasic or 100, 200, 300, 360 J for monophasic) versus beginning with single high energy/highest success rate for single shock delivered 7. Studies in infants and children have demonstrated the effectiveness of adenosine for the treatment of hemodynamically stable or un stable SVT 8. Adenosine should be considered the preferred medication for stable SVT a. Verapamil may be considered as alternative therapy in older children but should not be routinely used in infants b. Procainamide or amiodarone given by a slow IV infusion with c areful hemodynamic monitoring may be considered for refractory SVT Pertinent Assessment Findings None noted Patient Safety Considerations 1. Only use one antidysrhythmic at a time 2. Patients who receive beta -blockers (e.g., metoprolol ) with calcium channel blockers (e.g., diltiazem ) are at increased risk for hypotension and bradycardia 3. If using cardioversion, consider sedation and pain control 4. With irregular wide complex tachycardia ( A-FIB with aberrancy such as Wolff -Parkinson -White and Lown -Ganong Levine), avoid use of AV nodal blocking agents (e.g. , adenosine, calcium channel blockers, beta -blockers ) 5.

March 2022 Abuse and Maltreatment 55 Version 3.0 Abuse and Maltreatment Aliases Maltreatment of vulnerable populations Non-accidental trauma Definitions 1. Abuse/Maltreatment : Any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a patient of any age group. EMS clinicians should have a heightened awareness for vulnerable populations which include, but is not limited to, children, elderly, and adults with mental or physical disabilities 2. Child Abuse/Maltreatment : Child maltreatment includes any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. An act of commission (child abuse) is the physical, sexual, or emotiona l maltreatment or neglect of a child or children. An act of omission (child neglect) includes, but is not limited to, failure to provide for the child's needs ( e.g., physical, emotional, medical/dental, and educational neglect) and failure to supervise (e. g., inadequate supervision or safety precautions, lack of appropriate car seat use, and exposure to violent or dangerous environments) 3. Human Trafficking : when people are abducted or coerced into service (e.g., being forced into servitude without compensation and/or prostitution) . Signs may include, but are not limited to, patient with branding/tattoos and environmental clues such as padlocks and/or doorknobs removed on interior doors and intact windows that are boarded up Patient Care Goals 1. Recog nize any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a caregiver or person in a position of power over the patient that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a patient 2. Take appropriate steps to protect the safety of the responder s as well as bystanders 3. Remove the patient from immediate danger 4. Assess any patient injuries that may be the result of acute or chronic events 5. Attempt to preserve evidence whenever possible; however, the overriding concern should be providing appropriate e mergency care to the patient 6. Complete all mandatory reporting requirements per state guidelines Patient Presentation 1. Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary with age group of the patient and type of abuse 2. Not all abuse or maltreatment is physical 3. EMS role is to: a. Document concerns b. Assess potentially serious injuries c. Disclose concerns to appropriate authorities d. Initiate help to get the patient and any other vulnerable individuals at the scene into a safe situation e. Not to investigate or intervene beyond t he steps above f. Leave further intervention to law enforcement personnel NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Abuse and Maltreatment 56 Version 3.0 Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Absolute inclusion/exclusion criteria are not possible in this area. Rather, clues consistent with different types of abuse/maltreatment should be sought: 1. Potential clues to abuse/maltreatment from caregivers or general environment: a. Caregiver apathy about patient's current situation b. Caregiver overreaction to questions about situation c. Inconsistent histories from caregivers or bystanders regarding what happened d. Information provided by caregivers or patient that is not consistent with injury patterns e. Injuries not appropriate for patient's age or physical abilities (e.g., infants with injuries usually associated with ambulatory children, elders who have li mited mobility with injury mechanisms inconsistent with their capabilities) f. Caregiver not allowing adult patient to speak for themself, or who appears controlling - pay special attention to patients who cannot communicate due to young age or language and/or cultural barriers g. Inadequate safety precautions or facilities where the patient lives and/or evidence of security measures that appear to confine the patient inappropriately 2. Potential clues to abuse or maltreatment that can be obtained from the patient: a. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing b. Age-inappropriate behavior ( e.g., adults who are submissive or fearful, children who act in a sexually inappropriate way) c. Pattern burns, bruises, or scars suggestive of specific weaponry used d. Evidence of medical neglect for injuries or infections e. Unexplained trauma to genitourinary system s or frequent infections to this system f. Evidence of malnourishment and/or serious dental problems 3. Have a high index of suspicion for abuse in children presenting with a Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) [ See Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) & Acute Events in Infants Guideline ] Patient Management Assessment 1. Primary survey and identify any potentially life -threatening issues 2. Document thorough secondary survey to identify clues of for potential abuse/maltreatment: a. Multiple bruises in various stages of healing. A complete skin exam can help identify suggestive findings that would otherwise be missed b. Age-inappropriate behavior ( e.g., adults who are submissive or fearful, children who act in a sexually inappropriate way) c. Pattern burns, bruises, or scars suggestive of specific weaponry used d. Evidence of medical neglect for injuries or infections e. Unexplained trauma to genitourinary systems or frequent infections to this system f. Evidence of malnourishment and/or serious dental problems 3. Assess physical issues and avoid extensive investigation of the specifics of abuse or maltreatment, but document any statements made spont aneously by patient a. Avoid asking directed questions of a child NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Abuse and Malt reatment 57 Version 3.0 Treatment and Interventions 1. Address life -threatening issues 2. Remove the patient to a safe place even if no medical indication for transport 3. Report concerns about potential abuse/maltreatment to law enforcement immediately, in accordance with state law, including: a. Caregivers impeding your ability to assess/transport patient b. Caregivers refusing care for the patient 4. For patients transported, report concerns to hospital and/or l aw enforcement personnel (including Child Protective Services agencies where appropriate) per mandatory reporting laws Patient Safety Considerations 1. If no medical emergency exists, the next priority is safe patient disposition/removal from the potentially abusive situation 2. Do not confront suspected perpetrators of abuse/maltreatment. This can create an unsafe situation for EMS and for the patient 3. In situations of parental or religious objections to life -saving medical care when EMS suspects abuse, law enfo rcement should be notified for assistance Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. All states have specific mandatory reporting laws that dictate which specific crimes such as suspected abuse or maltreatment must be reported and to whom they must be reported. It is important to be familiar with the specific laws in your state including specifically who must make disclosures, what the thresholds are for disclosures, and to whom the disclosures must be made 2. Clues to abuse or maltreatment can vary depend ing on the age group of the patient and on the nature of the abuse. Remember that not all abuse or maltreatment involves physical harm. EMS clinician s are often unique in being the only members of the medical team to observe the home environment or injury scene . It is important to realize that the job of EMS is to document their concerns, assess the patient for potentially serious injuries, make sure that their concerns are disclosed to the appropriate legal authorities, and work towards getting the patient into a safe situation. EMS personnel should not take it upon themselves to investigate, interview, or intervene above and beyond those concepts and should leave further intervention to the appropriate law enforcement personnel 3. Abuse and maltreatment can h appen to patients of all ages 4. Patients may be unwilling or unable to disclose abuse or maltreatment, so the responsibility falls on EMS personnel to assess the situation, document appropriately, and take appropriate action to secure a safe place for the patient 5. Document findings by describing what you see and not ascribing possible causes (e.g. , \"0.5- inch round burn to back\" as opposed to \"burn consistent with cigarette burn\") Pertinent Assessment Findings As noted above NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev.

Provision of emergency medical care to the agitated, violent, or uncooperative patient 2. Maximizing and maintaining safety for the patient, EMS personnel, and others Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients of all ages who are exhibiting agitated or violent behavior, are a danger to self or others and in the sole assessment of the EMS clinician require physical and/or pharmacologic restraint to mitigate injury to self or others Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients exhibiting agitated or violent behavior due to medical conditions including, but not limited to: a. Head injury b. Metabolic disorders ( e.g., hypoglycemia, hypoxia) Patient Management Asse ssment 1. Note medications/substances on scene that may contribute to the agitation, or may be relevant to the treatment of a contributing medical condition 2. Maintain and support airway 3. Note respiratory rate and effort - If possible, monitor pulse oximetry and /or capnography 4. Assess circulatory status: a. Blood pressure (if possible) b. Pulse rate c. Capillary refill 5. Assess mental status a. Check blood glucose (if possible) 6. Obtain temperature (if possible) 7. Assess for evidence of traumatic injuries 8. Use a validated risk assessment tool such as RASS (Richmond Agitation Sedation Score), AMSS (Altered Mental Status Score), or BARS (Behavioral Activity Rating Scale) to risk stratify violent patients to help guide interventions Treatment and Interventions 1. Establish patient ra pport a. Attempt verbal reassurance and calm patient prior to use of pharmacologic and/or physical management devices b. Engage family members/loved ones to encourage patient cooperation if their presence does not exacerbate the patient's agitation NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency 60 Version 3.0 c. Continued ver bal reassurance and calming of patient following use of chemical/physical management devices 2. Pharmacologic management a. Notes: i. Selection of medications for pharmacologic management should be based upon the patient's clinical condition, current medications, and allergies in addition to EMS resources and medical direction ii.

Stretcher straps should be applied as the standard procedure for all patients during transport ii. Physi cal management devices, including stretcher straps, should never restrict the patient's chest wall motion iii. If necessary, sheets may be used as improvised supplemental stretcher straps. Other forms of improvised physical management devices should be discoura ged NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency 62 Version 3.0 iv. Supplemental straps or sheets may be necessary to prevent flexion/extension of torso, hips, legs by being placed around the lower lumbar region, below the buttocks, and over the thighs, knees, and legs b. Extremities i. Soft or leather devices should not req uire a key to release them ii. Secure all four extremities to maximize safety for patient, staff, and others iii. Secure all extremities to the stationary frame of the stretcher iv. Multiple knots should not be used to secure a device Patient Safety Considerations The management of violent patients requires a constant reevaluation of the risk/benefit balance for the patient and bystanders to provide the safest care for all involved. These are complex and high - risk encounters. There is no \"one size fit s all\" solution for addressing these patients 1. Don PPE 2. Do not attempt to enter or control a scene where physical violence or weapons are present 3. Dispatch law enforcement immediately to secure and maintain scene safety 4. Urgent de -escalation of patient agitat ion is imperative in the interest of patient safety as well as for EMS personnel and others on scene 5. Uncontrolled or poorly controlled patient agitation and physical violence can place the patient at risk for sudden cardiopulmonary arrest due to the follo wing etiologies: a. Delirium with agitated behavior : A postmortem diagnosis of exclusion for sudden death thought to result from metabolic acidosis (most likely from lactate) stemming from physical agitation or physical control measures and potentially exacer bated by stimulant drugs ( e.g., cocaine) or alcohol withdrawal b. Positional asphyxia : Sudden death from restriction of chest wall movement and/or obstruction of the airway secondary to restricted head or neck positioning resulting in hypercarbia and/or hypoxia 6. Apply a cardiac monitor as soon as possible, particularly when pharmacologic management medications have been administered 7. All patients who have received pharmacologic management medications must be monitored closely for the development of h ypoventilation and oversedation a. Utilize capnography if available 8. Patients who have received antipsychotic medication for pharmacologic management must be monitored closely for the potential development of: a. Dystonic reactions (this can easily be treated wit h diphenhydramine/benzodiazepines) b. Mydriasis (dilated pupils) c. Ataxia d. Cessation of e. Dry mucous membranes f. Cardiac arrhythmias (particularly QT prolongation) 9. Patients who require physical management should also receive pharmacological treatment for agitation to prevent consequences of delirium with agitated behavior 10. Placement of stretcher in sitting position prevents aspiration and reduces the patient's physical strength by placing the abdominal muscles in the flexed position 11. Patients who are more physically uncooperative should be physically secured with one arm above the head and the other arm below the waist, and both lower extremities individually secured NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavi oral Emergency 63 Version 3.0 12. The following techniques should be expressly prohibited for use by EMS clinician s: a. Secure or transport in a prone position with or without hands and feet behind the back (hobbling or \"hog -tying\") b. \"Sandwiching\" patients between backboards c. Techniques that constrict the neck or compromise the airway 13. Concurrent use of IM/IV benzodiazepines a nd olanzapine IM is not recommended as fatalities have been reported Notes/Educational Pearls Key considerations 1. Direct medical direction should be contacted at any time for advice, especially when patient's level of agitation is such that transport may p lace all parties at risk 2. Transport by air is not advised 3. Stretchers with adequate foam padding, particularly around the head, facilitates patient's ability to self -position the head and neck to maintain airway patency 4. For patients with key -locking devices, applied by another agency, consider the following options: a. Remove device and replace it with a device that does not require a key b. Administer pharmacologic management medication then remove and replace device with another non -key-locking device after patie nt has become more cooperative c. Transport patient accompanied in patient compartment by person who has device key d. Transport patient in the vehicle of person who has the device key if medical condition of patient is deemed stable, direct medical direction s o authorizes, and law allows Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Continuous monitoring of: a. Airway patency b. Respiratory status with pulse oximetry and/or capnography c. Circulatory status with frequent blood pressure measurements d. Mental status and trends in level of patient cooperation e. Cardiac status, especially if the patient has received pharmacologic management medication f.

March 2022 Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reaction 66 Version 3.0 Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reaction (Adapted from an evidence -based guideline created using the National Prehospital Evidence -Based Prehospital Guideline Model Process) Aliases Anaphylactic Shock Patient Care Goals 1. Provide timely therapy for potentially life -threatening reactions to known o r suspected allergens to prevent cardiorespiratory collapse and shock 2. Provide symptomatic relief for symptoms due to known or suspected allergens Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients of all ages with suspected allergic reaction and/or anaphylaxis Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Management Assessment 1. Evaluate for patent airway and presence of oropharyngeal edema 2. Auscultate for wheezing and assess level of respiratory effort 3. Assess for adequacy of perfusion 4. Assess for presence of signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis a. Anaphylaxis - More severe and is characterized by an acute onset involving: i. The skin (urticaria) and/or mucosa with either respiratory compromise or decreased BP or signs of end -organ dysfunction OR ii. Hypotension for that patient after exposure to a known allergen 1. Adults : Systolic BP less than 90 2. Pediatrics : See Appendix VIII . Abnormal Vital Signs OR iii. Two or more of the following occurring rapidly after exposure to a likely allergen: 1. Skin and/or mucosal involvement (urticaria, itchy, swollen tongue/lips) a. Skin involvement may be ABSENT in up to 40% of cases of anaphylaxis 2. Respiratory compromise stridor, hypoxemia) 3. gastrointestinal sy mptoms pain, diarrhea) 4. Hypotension or associated symptoms (syncope, hypotonia, chest tightness, incontinence) b. Non-anaphylactic Allergic Reaction i. Signs involving only one organ system ( e.g., localized angioedema that does not compromise the airway, or not associated with vomiting; hives alone) NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reaction 67 Version 3.0 Treatment and Interventions 1. If signs of allergic reaction without signs of anaphylaxis, go to Step 8 2. Epinephrine administration is the primary treatment for anaphylaxis. If signs of anaphylaxis, administer epinephrine 1 mg/mL at the following dose and route: a. Adult (25 kg or more) 0.3 mg IM in the anterolateral thigh b. Pediatric (less than 25 kg) 0.15 mg in the anterolateral thigh c. Epinephrine 1 mg/mL may be administered from a vial or via auto-injector, if available 3. If respiratory distress with wheezing is present , consider administering a. Albuterol 2.5 -5 mg nebulized AND/OR b. Epinephrine 1 mg/mL, 5 mL nebulized 4. If stridor is present, consider administering epinephrine 1 mg/mL, 5 mL nebulized 5. If signs of anaphylaxis a nd hypoperfusion persi st following the first dose of epinephrine, additional IM epinephrine can be repeated q5-15 minutes at above noted doses 6. For signs of hypoperfusion, also administer 20 mL/kg isotonic fluid ( normal sal ine or lactated Ringer's) rapidly (over 15 minutes) via IV or IO, and repeat as needed for ongoing hypoperfusion 7. Consider an epinephrine IV drip (0.5 mcg/kg/minute) when cardiovascular collapse (hypotension with altered mental status, pallor, diaphoresis and/or delayed capillary refill) is present despite repeated IM doses of epinephrine in conj unction with at least 60 mL/kg isotonic fluid boluses 8. For urticaria or pruritus, administer a diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg, up to maximum dose of 50 mg IM, IV, or PO) a. The IV route is preferred for the patient in severe symptoms b. As a supplement to diphenhydramine given for urticaria, any H2 -blocking antihistamine (e.g., famotidine, cimetidine) can be given IV or PO in conjunction with diphenhydramine 9. Transport as soon as possible, and perform ongoing assessment as indicated. Cardiac monitoring is no t required, but should be considered for those with known heart problems or who received multiple doses of epinephrine Patient Safety Considerations 1. Time to epinephrine delivery 2. Concentration of epinephrine in relation to route 3. Weight -based dosing of medications Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. When anaphylaxis is suspected, EMS personnel should always consider epinephrine as first - line treatment 2. Allergic reactions and anaphylaxis are serious and potentially life -threatening medical emergen cies. It is the body's adverse reaction to a foreign protein ( e.g., food, medicine, pollen, insect sting or any ingested, inhaled, or injected substance). A localized allergic reaction ( e.g., urticaria or angioedema that does not compromise the airway) may be treated with antihistamine therapy. Cardiovascular collapse may occur abruptly, without the prior development of skin or respiratory symptoms. Constant monitoring of the patient's airway and breathing is essential NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Anaphylaxis and Allergic Reaction 68 Version 3.0 3. Contrary to common belief that all cas es of anaphylaxis present with cutaneous manifestations, such as urticaria or mucocutaneous swelling, a significant portion of anaphylactic episodes may not involve these signs and symptoms on initial presentation. Moreover, most fatal reactions to food -induced anaphylaxis in children were not associated with cutaneous manifestations 4. A thorough assessment and a high index of suspicion are required for all potential allergic reaction patients - consider: a. History of Present Illness i. Onset and location ii. Insect s ting or bite iii. Food allergy/exposure iv. New clothing, soap, detergent v. Past history of reactions vi. Medication history b. Signs and Symptoms i. Itching or urticaria ii. Coughing, wheezing, or respiratory distress iii. Chest tightness or throat constriction iv. Hypotension or shock v. Persistent gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) vi. Altered mental status (AMS) c. Other Considerations i. Angioedema (drug -induced) ii. Aspiration/airway obstruction iii. Vasovagal event iv. Asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) v. Heart failure 5. Gastrointestinal symptoms occur most commonly in food -induced anaphylaxis, but can occur with other causes a. Oral pruritus is often the first symptom observed in patients experiencing food -induced anaphylaxis b. Abdominal cramping is also c ommon, but nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are frequently observed as well 6. Patients with asthma are at high -risk for a severe allergic reaction 7. There is no proven benefit to using steroids in the management of allergic reactions and/or anaphylaxis 8. There is controversy among experts with very low-quality evidence to guide management for the use of empiric IM epinephrine after exposure to a known allergen in asymptomatic patients with a history of prior anaphylaxis Pertinent Assessment Findings 1.

Pediatric dosing: a. 1 mg IM/IN if 20 kg (or 5 years old (or prefilled 4 mg dry powder IN for patients greater than 4 years old or prefilled IM autoinjector) b. 0.5 mg IM/IN if less than 20 kg (or less than 5 years old ) iii. Remove or disable insulin pump if above treatments cannot be completed a. For patients with an insulin pump who are hypoglycemic with associated altered mental status (GCS less than 15): i. Stop the pump, disconnect, or remove at insertion site if patient cannot ingest oral glucose or ALS is not available ii. Leave the pump connected and running if able to ingest oral glucose or receive ALS interventions 2. Reassess patient a. Reassess vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment ) and mental status b. Repeat check of blood glucose level if previous hypoglycemia and mental status has not returned to normal i. It is not necessary to repeat check of blood glucose level blood sugar if mental status has returned to normal c. If maximal field dosage of dextrose solution does not achieve euglycemia and normalization of mental status: i. Initiate transport to closest appropriate receiving facility for further treatment of refractory hypoglycemia ii. Evaluate for alternative causes of altered mental status iii. Continue treatment of hypoglycemia using dextrose solutions as noted above 3. Disposition a. If hypoglycemia with continued symptoms, transport to closest appropriate receiving facility b. Hypoglycemic patients who have had a seizure should be transported to the hospital regardless of their mental status and response to therapy c. If symptoms of hypoglycemia resolve after t reatment, release without transport should only be considered if all the following are true: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Hypoglycemia 86 Version 3.0 i. Repeat glucose is greater than 80 mg/dL ii. Patient takes insulin or metformin to control diabetes and does not take long -acting oral sulphunylurea agents (e.g., glipi zide, glyburide, or others) iii. Patient returns to normal mental status, with no focal neurologic signs/symptoms after receiving glucose/dextrose iv. Patient can promptly obtain and will eat a carbohydrate meal v. Patient or legal guardian refuses transport and EMS clinician s agree transport not indicated vi. A reliable adult will be staying with patient vii. No major co -morbid symptoms exist, like chest pain, shortness of breath, seizures, intoxication viii. A clear cause of the hypoglycemia is identified (e.g., missed meal) Patient Safety Considerations 1. Dextrose 10% can be safely used in all ages of patient. Dextrose 10% works as effectively and quickly as other concentrations 2. Dextrose 50% can cause local tissue damage if it extravasates from vein and may cause hyperglycemia. Dextrose 50% carries risk for little clinical gain. EMS systems may consider carrying no more than 25% concentration of dextrose for treating hypoglycemia in adults 3. For children less than 8 years old , dextrose concentration of no more than 25% should be used 4. For neonates and infants less than 1 month of age, dextrose concentration of no more than 10 - 12.5% should be used 5. Sulfonylureas ( e.g., glyburide, glipizide) have long half -lives ranging from 12 -60 hrs. Patients with corrected hypoglycemia who are taking these agents are at particular risk for recurrent symptoms and frequently require hospital admission Notes/Educational Pearls A formula for calculating a 0.5 g/kg dose of IV dextrose: (____% concentration of glucose) x (_____mL/kg) = 50 For example: Desired Fluid type mL of Dose 10% dextrose is as effective and safer than other stronger concentrations 2. Consider contribution of oral diabetic medications to hypoglycemia 3. If possible, have family/patient turn off insulin pump 4. Consider potential for in tentional overdose of hypoglycemic agents 5. Avoid overshoot hyperglycemia when correcting hypoglycemia. Administer dextrose - containing IV fluids in small doses until either mental status improves or a maximum field dose is achieved NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev.

Routine patient care ( e.g., vital signs) 2. History and physical examination focused on potential causes of nausea and vomiting ( e.g., well as medications that may prolong the QT interval 3. Obtain glucose level Treatment and Interventions 1. Antiemetic medication administration a. Isopropyl alcohol : Allow patient to inhale vapor from isopropyl alcohol wipe 3 times q (quaque, every) 15 minutes as tolerated b. Ondansetron (contraindicated for suspected or known diagnosis of prolonged QT syndrome) i. Adult : 1. 4 mg IV/PO/SL OR 2. 4 or 8 mg SL of the ODT formulation ii. Pediatric (6 months - 14 years old): 1. 0.15 mg/kg IV/PO (maximum dose of 4 mg) OR 2. 2 mg SL for ages 1 -5 years old; age 6 and older use 4 mg of the ODT formulation c. Metoclopramide i. Adult : 10 mg IV/IM ii. Pediatric (greater than 2 years old only and greater than 12 kg): 1. 0.1 mg/kg IM OR NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Nausea -Vomiting 90 Version 3.0 2. 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum 10 mg) a. May repeat x 1 in 20 -30 minutes if no relief d. Prochlorperazine i. Adult : 5 mg IV/IM ii. Pediatric (over 2 years old only and greater than 12 kg): 1. 0.1 mg/kg slow IV OR 2. 0.1 mg/kg d eep IM (maximum 10 mg) e. Droperidol i. Adult : 1.25 mg IV/IM (contraindicated for suspected or known diagnosis of prolonged QT syndrome) f. Diphenhydramine i. Adult : 12.5 -25 mg IV/IM/PO ii. Pediatric (over 2 years old only and greater than 12 kg): 0.1 mg/kg IV (maximum 25 mg) Patient Safety Considerations 1. Ondansetron should not be administered to patients who have a prolonged QT inter val as it can cause torsades . 2. For very young pediatric patients, ondansetron can be sedating 3. Dystonic and extrapyramidal symptoms are possible side effects of antiemetics - If encountered, consider diphenhydramine: a. Adult : 25-50 mg IV/IM/PO b. Pediatric : 1 mg/kg IV/IM/PO (maximum dose 50 mg) 4. Medications that prolong the QT interval may alter treatment options. Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Ondansetron is preferred in children for the treatment of nausea and vomiting 2. Metoclopramid e has fewer adverse effects than prochlorperazine in children 3. Prochlorperazine and metoclopramide (phenothiazines) have an increased risk of dystonic reactions a. Some phenothiazines also have an increased risk of respiratory depression when used with other medications that cause respiratory depression, and some phenothiazines can cause neuroleptic malignant syndrome b. Prochlorperazine carries a black box warning for use in elderly patients with dementia - related psychosis. 4. IV form of ondansetron may be given PO in same dose 5. Nausea and vomiting are symptoms of illness - in addition to treating the patient's nausea and vomiting a thorough history and physical are key to identifying what may be a disease in need of emergent treatment ( e.g., bowel obstruction, myocardial infarction, pregnancy) 6. While ondansetron has not been adequately studied in pregnancy to determine safety, women should be counseled regarding the available data . In the first trimester of pregnancy, the administration of metoclopramide 5 -10 mg IV with diphenhydramine 25 mg IV is recommended over the administration of ondansetron NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev.

Minimize adverse events in the treatment of pain Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients who are experiencing pain regardless of transport interval Exclusion Criteria Pregnancy with active labor Patient Management Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions 1. Choice of medication class, route of administration, dosing and freque ncy are based on pain severity and the need for escalation from oral to parenteral routes 2. The dosing guidelines apply to patients of all ages except where noted 3. Determine patient's pain score assessment using standard pain scale a. Less than 4 years old or those with cognitive impairment unable to self -report: i. Observational Scales 1. Faces, Legs, Arms, Cry, Consolability (FLACC ) 2. Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS ) b. 4-12 years old : i. Self-report scale 1. Wong Baker Faces 2. Faces Pain Scale (FPS) 3. Faces Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) c.

Application of ice packs and/or splints for pain secondary to trauma c. Verbal reassurance to control anxiety 5. Minor pain or as an adjunct for moderate/severe pain consider the following non -opioid analgesic op tions: a. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg PO or IV (maximum dose 1 g) b. Nonsteroidal anti -inflammatories i. Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg PO for patients greater than 6 months of age (maximum dose 800 mg) OR NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Pain Management 94 Version 3.0 ii. Ketorolac 1. Adult: 30 mg IM or 15 mg IV 2. Pediatric age 2 -16 years old : 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose of 30 mg IM or 15 mg IV) c. Nitrous Oxide 6. For Moderate to Severe pain, analgesics include: a. Morphine sulfate: i. 0.1 mg/kg IM, IV or IO (maximum initial dose is 10 mg) b. Fentanyl: i. 1 mcg/kg IN, IM, IV or IO (maximum initial dose of 100 mcg) c. Hydromorphone: i. 0.015 mg/kg IM, IV, or IO (maximum initial dose 2 mg; maximum cumulative dose of 4 mg) d. Ketamine: i. 0.25 mg/kg IM, IV or IO (maximum initial dose 25 mg; maximum cumulative dose 100 mg) 7. Use of non -invasive capnography is an earlier predictor of hypoventilation than pulse oximetry if opioid medications are administered 8. Consider administration of oral, sublingual, or IV antiemetics to prevent nausea [ See Nausea/Vomiting Guideline ] 9. If indicated based on pain assessment, and vital signs allow, repeat pain medication administration (excluding acetaminophen and nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medicines) after 5 minutes of the previous dose 10. Transport in position of comfort and reassess as indicated Patient Safety Considerations 1. All patients should have drug allergies identified prior to administration of pain medication 2. Administer opioids with caution to patients with Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) less than 15, hypotension, identified medication allergy, hypoxia (SPO 2 less than 90%) after maximal supplemental oxygen therapy, or signs of hypoventilation 3. Opioids are contraindicated for patients who have taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) during the previous 14 days 4. Avoid non -steroidal anti -inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen and ketorolac in patients with NSAID allergy, aspirin -sensitive asthma, renal insufficiency, pregnancy, or known peptic ulcer disease 5. Ketorolac should not be used in patients with hypotension (due to renal toxicity) 6. Use of splinting techniques and application of ice should be done to reduce the total amount of medication used to keep the patient comfortable Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Intranasal routes of opioid analgesia are preferred as the initial dosing route in pediatrics where IV access may be problematic; consider in other patient populations when an IV in not otherwise indicated 2. Onset of action is dependent on the pharmacokinetics of the drug class as well as route of a dministration; oral analgesics are effective for pain control but NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Pain Management 95 Version 3.0 have a slower onset of action so plan accordingly 3. Pain severity scores should be recorded before and after analgesic medication administration and upon arrival at destination 4. Patients with a cute abdominal pain should receive analgesic interventions - Use of analgesics for acute abdominal pain does not mask clinical findings or delay diagnosis 5. Opiates may cause a rise in intracranial pressure Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Mental status (Glasg ow Coma Score (GCS) and pain level) 2. Respiratory system (tidal volume, chest rigidity) 3.

Midazolam 0.2 mg/kg (maximum dose 10 mg), IM preferred, or IN b. If vascular access (IV or IO) is present: i. Diazepam 0. 2 mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 10 mg ii. Lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 4 mg iii. Midazolam 0.1 mg/kg IV or IO, maximum 4 mg 8. Glucometry a. If still ac tively seizing, check blood glucose level b. If less than 60 mg/dL, treat per the Hypoglycemia Guideline 9. Administer magnesium sulfate in the presence of seizure in the third trimester of pregnancy or postpartum [ See Eclampsia/Pre -eclampsia Guideline ] 10. For febrile seizures, consider the following interventions after stopping the seizure . Please note that the administration of nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory medications is contraindicated in infants less than 6 months of age. The following interventions provid e symptomatic relief for fevers , but do not stop the seizure: b. Acetaminophen 15 mg/kg, maximum dose 650 mg, PR/IV/IO (if unable to swallow) or PO (if able to swallow) AND /OR c. Ketorolac 1 mg/kg, maximum dose 15 mg, IV (if unable to swallow) OR Ibuprofen 10 mg/kg, maximum dose 600 mg, PO (if able to swallow) AND /OR d. Removing excessive layers of clothing AND /OR e. Applying cool compresses to the body 11. Consider acquiring a 12 -lead EKG following cessation of seizure in patients without a history of seizure to determ ine possible cardiac cause NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev. March 2022 Seizures 103 Version 3.0 Patient Safety Considerations 1. Trained personnel should be able to give medication without contacting medical direction , however, more than two doses of benzodiazepines are associated with high -risk of airway compromise a. Use cauti on, weigh risks/benefits of deferring treatment until hospital, and/or consider consultation with medical direction if patient has received two doses of benzodiazepines by bystanders and/or prehospital clinician s 2. Hypoglycemic patients who are treated in the field for seizure should be transported to hospital, regardless of whether they return to baseline mental status after treatment Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Many airway/breathing issues in seizing patients can be managed without intubation or placement of an advanced airway. Reserve these measures for patients that fail less invasive maneuvers as noted above 2. For children with convulsive status epilepticus requiring medication management in the prehospital setting, trained EMS personnel should be allowed to administer medication without medical direction 3. For new onset seizures or seizur es that are refractory to treatment, consider other potential causes including, but not limited to, trauma, stroke, electrolyte abnormality, toxic ingestion, pregnancy with eclampsia, hyperthermia 4. A variety of safe and efficacious doses for benzodiazepines have been noted in the literature for seizures a. The doses for anticonvulsant treatment noted above are those that are common to the forms and routes of benzodiazepines noted in this guideline b. One dose, rather than a range, has been suggested to standardize a common dose in situations when an EMS agency may need to switch from one type of benzodiazepine to another due to cost or resource limitations 5. Recent evidence supports the use of midazolam IM as an intervention that is at least as safe and effective as intravenous lorazepam for prehospital seizure cessation Pertinent Assessment Findings The presence of fever with seizure in children less than 6 months old and greater than 6 years old is not consistent with a simple febrile seizure, and should prompt evaluation for meningitis, encephalitis, or other cause Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914141 - Medical - Seizure Key Documentation Elements Actively seizing during transport and time of seizure onset/cessation Onset, focality, direction of eye deviation Concurrent symptoms of apnea, cyanosis, vomiting, bowel/bladder incontinence, or fever Medication amounts/routes given by bystanders or prehospital clinician s NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC General Medical Rev.

March 2022 Shock 110 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Early, aggressive IV fluid administration is essential in the treatment of suspected septic s hock 2. Patients predis posed to shock: a. Immunocompromised (patients undergoing chemotherapy or with a primary or acquired immunodeficiency) b. Adrenal insufficiency (Addison's disease, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, chronic or recent steroid use) c. History of a solid organ or bone marrow transplant d. Infants e. Elderly 3. In most adults, tachycardia is the first sign of compensated shock, and may persist for hours. Tachycardia can be a late sign of shock in children and a tachycardic child may be close to cardiovascular collapse 4. Hypote nsion indicates uncompensated shock, which may progress to cardiopulmonary failure within minutes . Hypotension is a late and ominous sign in pediatric uncompensated shock 5. Hydrocortisone succinate, if available, is preferred over methylprednisolone and dexa methasone for the patient with adrenal insufficiency because of its dual glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid effects a. Patients with no reported history of adrenal axis dysfunction may have adrenal suppression due to their acute illness, and hydrocortisone should be considered for any patient showing signs of treatment -resistant shock b. Patients with adrenal insufficiency may have an emergency dose of hydrocortisone available that can be administered IV or IM Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Decreased perfusion manifested by altered mental status, or abnormalities in capillary refill or pulses, decreased urine output (1 Cardiogenic, hypovolemic, obstructive shock : capillary refill greater than 2 seconds, diminished peripheral pulses, mottled cool extremities b.

Return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) 2. Preservation of neurologic function 3. High -quality chest compressions/CPR with minimal interruption from recognition of cardiac arrest until confirmation of ROSC or field termination of care Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients with cardiac arrest Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients suffering cardiac arrest due to severe hypothermia [ See Hypothermia/Cold Exposure Guideline ] 2. Patients with identifiable Do Not Resuscitate (or equivalent such as POLST) order [ See Do Not Resuscitate Status/Advance Directive/Healthcare Power of Attorney (POA) Status Guideline ] 3. Patients in arrest due to traumatic etiology [ See General Trauma Management Guideline ] Patient Management Assess ment 1. The patient in cardiac arrest requires a prompt balance of treatment and assessment 2. In cases of cardiac arrest, assessments should be focused and limited to obtaining enough information to reveal the patient is pulseless 3. Once pulselessness is discove red, treatment should be initiated immediately, and any further history must be obtained by bystanders while treatment is ongoing Treatment and Interventions The most important therapies for patients suffering from cardiac arrest are prompt cardiac defibrillation for shockable rhythms and minimally interrupted effective chest compressions 1. Initiate chest compressions in cases with no bystander chest compressions or take over compressions from bystanders while a second rescuer is setting up the AED or defibrillator a. If adequate, uninterrupted bystander CPR has been performed or if the patient arrests in front of the EMS clinician s, immediately proceed with rhythm analysis and defibrillation, if appropriate b. It is realistic for EMS clinician s to tailor the sequence of rescue actions to coincide the most likely cause of arrest c. There is insuffici ent evidence to recommend for or against delaying defibrillation to provide a period of CPR for patients in VF/pulseless VT out -of-hospital cardiac arrest NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Cardiac Arrest (VF/VT /Asystole/PEA) 118 Version 3.0 d. For adults and children with unwitnessed cardiac arrest or for whom an AED is not immediately availab le, it is reasonable that CPR be initiated while the defibrillator equipment is being retrieved and applied and that defibrillation, if indicated, be attempted as soon as the device is ready for use 2. The maximum setting on the defibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent defibrillation attempts. Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer's recommendation in the case of biphasic defibrillators. If the manufacturer's recommendation is unknown, use highest setting possible. In the case of monophasic devices, the setting should be 360 J (joule ) (or 4 J/kg for children) 3. Chest compressions should resume immediately after defibrillation attempts with no pauses for pulse checks for 2 minutes regardless of the rhythm displayed on the cardiac moni tor 4. All attempts should be made to prevent avoidable interruptions in chest compressions, such as pre -charging the defibrillator and hovering over the chest, rather than stepping away during defibrillations 5. If feasible, IV or IO access should be obtained. Administer epinephrine during the first or second round of compressions . Prioritize early administration of epinephrine for non - shockable rhythms 6. Continue the cycle of chest compressions for 2 minutes, followed by rhythm analysis and defibrillation of shoc kable rhythms; during this period , the proper strategy of airway management is currently not defined and many options for airway management exist . Regardless of the airway management and ventilation strategy, consider the following principles: a. The airway management strategy should not interrupt compressions b. Successful resuscitation from cardiac arrest depends primarily on effective, minimally interrupted chest compressions and prompt defibrillation if the patient is in pulseless VT/VF . As opposed to children, an adult's airway management is of secondary importance and should not interfere with compressions and defibrillation . Options for airway management include: i. Passive ventilation: 1. High flow oxy gen is applied via a non -rebreather mask with an oropharyngeal airway 2. Some oxygen will be entrained with each decompression of the chest 3. This may be applied for the first 3 -4 compression cycles (6 -8 minutes), after which one may consider BVM ventilation or placement of an advanced airway ii. BVM ventilation at 10 breaths per minute (1 breath every 10 compressions), applied during the upstroke between compressions, without interrupting the compressions iii. BVM ventilation with 30:2 ventilation to compression ratio: Each 30 compressions, the compressions are paused briefly to allow 2 BVM ventilations, then compressions immediately resumed 1. Pediatric Consideration: For multiple rescuer CPR in children, 15:2 is the recommended compression -to-ventilati on ratio (30:2 for single rescuer) 2. Pediatric Consideration: For neonates, 3:1 is the recommended compression -to- ventilation ratio iv. Advanced airway placement: 1. Either a supraglottic airway or an endotracheal tube may be placed without interruption of compressions 2. Ventilations are provided at 10 breaths/minute for adults NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Cardiac Arrest (VF/VT/Asystole/PEA) 119 Version 3.0 3. Pediatric Consideration: for children, 1 breath every 3-5 seconds is recommended (12 -20 breaths/minute) 4. Pediatric Consideration: deliver volume needed to achieve chest rise 7. Consider use of antiarrhythmic for recurrent VF/Pulseless VT a. The principal objective of antiarrhythmic drug therapy in shock -refractory VF and pulseless VT is to facilitate the restoration and maintenance of a spontaneous perfusing rhythm in con cert with the shock termination of VF/VT; some antiarrhythmic drugs have been associated with increased rates of ROSC and hospital admission, but none have yet been proven to increase long -term survival or survival with good neurologic outcome i. Amiodarone (5 mg/kg IV, max of 300 mg) may be considered for VF/pulseless VT that is unresponsive to CPR, defibrillation, and a vasopressor therapy ii. Lidocaine (1 mg/kg IV) may be considered as an alternative to amiodarone for VF/pulseless VT that is unresponsive to CP R, defibrillation, and vasopressor therapy iii. The routine use of magnesium for VF/pulseless VT is not recommended in adult patients unless it is refractory, polymorphic VT, or Torsades de pointes . b. There is inadequate evidence to support the routine use of lid ocaine and beta -blockers after cardiac arrest by EMS . There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine initiation or continuation of other antiarrhythmic medications after ROSC from cardiac arrest c. For torsades de pointes, give magnesium sulfate 2 g IV administered over 1-2 minutes (or 25-50 mg/kg for pediatrics ). There is insufficient evidence to recommend for or against the routine administration during cardiac arrest 8. Consider reversible causes of cardiac arrest which include the following: a. Hypothermia - additions to care include attempts at active rewarming [ See Hypothermia/Cold Exposure Guideline ] b. The dialysis patient/known hyperkalemic patient - Additions to care include the following: i. Calcium gluconate 10% 1 g IV bolus over 2 minutes (for pediatrics , the dose is 100 mg/kg which is 1 mL/kg ), can repeat the dose if no response OR ii. Calcium chloride 10% 1 g IV bolus over 2 minutes (for pediatrics , the dose is 20 mg/kg which is 0.2 mL/kg) iii. Sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV c. Tricyclic antidepressant overdose . Additions to care include sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg IV d. Hypovolemia . Additions to care include normal saline 2 L IV (or 20 mL/kg, repeated up to 3 times for pediatrics ) e. If the patient is intubated at the time of arrest, assess for tension pneumothorax and misplaced ETT f. If tension pneumothorax suspected, perform needle decompression. Assess ETT, if misplaced, replace ETT 9. If at any time during this period of resuscitation the patient regains return of spontaneous circulation, treat per Adult Post -ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulation) Care Guideline 10. If resuscitation remains ineffective, consider termination of resuscitation [ See Termination of Resuscitative Effo rts Guideline ] NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Cardiac Arrest (VF/VT/Asystole/PEA) 120 Version 3.0 Patient Safety Considerations 1. Performing manual chest compressions in a moving vehicle may pose a clinician safety concern 2. In addition, manual chest compressions during patient movement are less effective in regard to hands on time, depth, recoil and rate 3. Ideally, patients should be resuscitated as close to the scene as operationally possible 4. Risks and benefits should be consi dered before patient movement in cardiac arrest situations Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Effective chest compressions and defibrillation are the most important therapies to the patient in cardiac arrest. Effective chest compressions are defined as: a. A rate of greater than 100 and less than 120 compressions/minute b. Depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) and less than 2.4 inches (6 cm) for adults and children or 1.5 inches (4 cm) for infants; adolescents who have entered puberty should receive the same depth of chest compressions as an adult c. Allow for complete chest recoil (avoid leaning) d. Minimize interruptions in compressions e. Avoid rescuer fatigue by rotating rescuers at least every 2 minutes. Some EMS pit crew approaches use a clinician on either side of th e chest, alternating compressions every minute or every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue 2. Avoid excessive ventilation and consider delayed airway management - If no advanced airway, consider: a. Passive ventilation using an NRB with 3 -4 cycles of uninterrupte d chest compressions (for arrests of suspected cardiac etiology). Consider BVM ventilation or advanced airway after 3-4 cycles b. BVM ventilation every 10 -15 compressions with cycles of uninterrupted chest compressions. Upstroke ventilation between compressions.30:2 ventilation to compression ratio for adults, and 15:2 for children when 2 rescuers are present c. If an advanced airway is placed, ventilations should not exceed 10 breaths/minute (1 breath every 6 seconds or 1 breath every 10 compressions) in adults. Pediatric Consideration: For children with an advanced airway, 1 breath every 3 -5 seconds is recommended (equivalent to 12 -20 breaths/minute) 3. Quantitative end-tidal capnography ( EtCO 2) should be used to monitor effectiveness of chest compression s a. If EtCO 2 less than 10 mmHg during the initial phases of resuscitation, attempt to improve chest compression quality b. Consider additional monitoring with biometric feedback which may improve compliance with suggested Resuscitation Section 4. Chest compressions are usually the most rapidly applied therapy for the patient in cardiac arrest an d should be initiated as soon as the patient is noted to be pulseless. If the patient is being monitored with pads in place at the time of arrest, immediate defibrillation should take precedence over all other therapies . However, if there is any delay in defibrillation ( e.g., in order to place pads), chest compressions should be initiated while the defibrillator is being applied. There is no guidance on how long these initial compressions should be applied; however, it is reasonable to either complete betw een 30 seconds and 2 minutes of chest NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Cardiac Arrest (VF/VT/Asystole/PEA) 121 Version 3.0 compressions in cases of no bystander chest compressions or to perform defibrillation as soon as possible after chest compressions initiated in cases of witnessed arrest 5. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of extracorporeal CPR (ECPR) for patients with cardiac arrest . In settings where it can be rapidly implemented, ECPR may be considered for select cardiac arrest patients for whom the suspected etiology of the cardiac arrest is potentially rever sible during a limited period of mechanical cardiorespiratory support 6. Chest compressions should be reinitiated immediately after defibrillation as pulses, if present, are often difficult to detect and rhythm and pulse checks interrupt compressions 7. Continue chest compressions between completion of AED analysis and AED charging 8. The e ffectiveness of chest compressions decreases when moving patients a. Patients should therefore be resuscitated as close to the point at which they are first encountered and should only be moved if the conditions on scene are unsafe or do not operationally allow for resuscitation b. Chest compressions are also less effective in a moving vehicle c. It is also dangerous to EMS clinician s, patients, pedestrians, and other motorists to perform chest compressions in a moving ambulance d. For these reasons and because in most cases the care provided by EMS clinician s is equivalent to that provided in emergency departments, resuscitation should occur on scene 9. The maximum setting o n the defibrillator should be used for initial and subsequent defibrillation attempts. Defibrillation dosing should follow manufacturer's recommendation in the case of biphasic defibrillators. If the manufacturer's recommendation is unknown, use highest se tting possible. In the case of monophasic devices, the setting should be 360 J (joule ) (or 4 J/kg for children) 10. IV or IO access without interrupting chest compressions 11. Administer epinephrine (0.1 mg/kg, maximum dose 1 mg) IV/IO during the first or second round of compressions 12. At present, the most effective mechanism of airway management is uncertain due to some systems managing the airway aggressively and others managing the airway with basic measures and both types of systems finding excellent outcomes. Regardless of the airway management style, consider the following principles: a. Airway management should not interrupt chest compressions b. Carefully follow ventilation rate and prevent hyperventilation c. Consider limited tidal volumes d. There is uncertainty regarding the proper goals for oxygenation during resuscitation i. Current recommendations suggest using the highest flow rate possible through NRB or BVM ii. This should not be continued into the post -resuscitation phase in which the goal should be a n oxygen saturation (SpO 2) of 94 -98% e. Pediatric Considerations : Special attention should be applied to the pediatric population and airway management/respiratory support. Given that the most likely cause of cardiac arrest is respiratory, airway management m ay be considered early in the patient's care i. However, the order of Circulation -Airway -Breathing is still recommended as the order of priority by the American Heart Association for pediatric resuscitation to ensure timely initiation of chest compressions to maintain perfusion, regardless of the underlying cause of the arrest NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Cardiac Arrest (VF/VT/Asystole/PEA) 122 Version 3.0 ii. In addition, conventional CPR is preferred in children, since it is associated with better outcomes when compared to compression -only CPR 13. Special Circumstances in Cardiac Arrest a. Trauma, treat per the General Trauma Management Guideline b. Pregnancy i. The best hope for fetal survival is maternal survival ii. Position the patient in the supine position with a second rescuer performing manual uterine displacement to the left to displace the gravid uterus and increase venous return by avoiding aorto -caval compression iii. If manual displacement is unsuccessful, the pa tient may be placed in the left lateral tilt position at 30\u00b0. This position is less desirable than the manual uterine displacement as chest compressions are more difficult to perform in this position iv. Chest compressions should be performed slightly higher o n the sternum than in the non-pregnant patient to account for elevation of the diaphragm and abdominal contents in the obviously gravid patient v. Defibrillation should be performed as in non -pregnant patients c. Arrests of respiratory etiology (including drow ning) . In addition to the above, consider early management of the patient's airway. Passive ventilation with a NRB is not indicated for these patients 14. Application of the \"pit crew\" model of resuscitation a. Ideally, clinician s in each EMS agency will use a \" pit crew\" approach when using this protocol to ensure the most effective and efficient cardiac arrest care. Training should include teamwork simulations integrating first responders, BLS, and ALS crewmembers who regularly work together. High -performance sy stems should practice teamwork using \"pit crew\" techniques with predefined roles and crew resource management principles. For example (the Pennsylvania State EMS Model for Pit Crew): i. Rescuer 1 and 2 set up on opposite sides of patient's chest and perform continuous chest compressions, alternating after every 100 compressions to avoid fatigue ii. Use a metronome or CPR feedback device to ensure that compression rate is 100 - 120/minute iii. Chest compressions are only interrupted during rhythm check (AED analysis or manual) and defibrillation shocks - Continue compressions when AED /defibrillator is charging iv. Additional rescuer obtains IO (or IV) access and gives epinephrine . For IO access: 1. The proximal humerus is the preferred site for adults 2. The tibial site is preferred for infants and children v. During the first four cycles of compressions/defibrillation (approximately 10 minutes) avoid advanced airway placement vi. One responding clinician assumes code leader position overseeing the entire response vii. Use a CPR checkli st to ensure that all best practices are followed during CPR b. For efficient \"pit crew\" style care, the EMS agency medical director should establish the options that will be used by clinician s functioning within the EMS agency. Options include establishing: i. The airway/ventilation management, if any, that will be used ii. The initial route of vascular access 15. The EMS agency must perform a Quality Improvement ( QI) review of care and outcome, overseen by the agency medical director, for every patient that receives CP R NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Cardiac Arrest (VF/VT/Asystole/PEA) 123 Version 3.0 a. The QI should be coordinated with local receiving hospitals to include hospital admission, discharge, and condition information. This EMS agency QI can be accomplished by participation an organized cardiac arrest registry b. The QI should be coordinated wit h local PSAP/dispatch centers to review opportunities to assure optimal recognition of possible cardiac arrest cases and provision of dispatch - assisted CPR (including hands -only CPR when appropriate) Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914011 - Cardiac Arrest - Asystole 9914013 - Cardiac Arrest - Hypothermia -Therapeutic 9914015 - Cardiac Arrest - Pulseless Electrical - Cardiac Arrest - Ventricular Fibrillation/Pulseless Ventricular Tachycardia) 9914055 - General - Cardiac Arrest 9914087 - Injury - Cardiac Arrest Key Documentation Elements Should be tailored to any locally utilized data registry but may incl ude as a minimum the following elements : o Resuscitation attempted and all interventions performed o Arrest witnessed o Location of arrest o First monitored rhythm o CPR before EMS arrival o Outcome o Any ROSC o Presumed etiology Presumed cardiac Trauma Submersion Respiratory Other non -cardiac Unknown Performance Measures Time to scene Time to patient Time to first CPR Time to first shock Time of ROSC Review of CPR quality o Compression fraction o Average and longest peri -shock pause o Rate and depth of compressions NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev.

The goal is therefore to maximize survival and optimize neurologic and cardiovascular function following a return of spontaneous circulation by the following steps: Secure airway Obtain vascular access Maximize blood pressure Identify ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) or reversible causes of arrest Recognize pending re -arrest Consider appropriate destination choice Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patient returned to spontaneous circulation following cardiac arrest resuscitation Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Management Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions 1. Perform general patient assessment attempting to identify cause of cardiac arrest . 2. Support life-threatening problems associated with airway, breathing, and circulation . a. For example, most of the pediatric cardiac arrest occurs due to non -cardiac causes such as respiratory failure (hypoxemia) or shock (hypovolemia). 3. Monitor closely for recurrenc e of cardiac arrest using clinical and adjunctive criteria such as cardiac monitoring, EtCO 2 monitoring, and physical signs of perfusion 4. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation. Do not hyperoxygenate. 5. Do not hyperventilate. Maintain a ventilation rate of 8 -10 breaths per minute, targeting an EtCO 2 of 35-45 mmHg. 6. For hypotension (SBP less than 90 mmHg or MAP less than 65 in adults) see Shock Guideline 7. Perform serial 12 -lead EKGs to assess for evidence of reversible cause of arrest such as STEMI or electrolyte derangement (e .g., hyperkalemia) 8. Post -cardiac arrest patients with evidence or interpretation consistent with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI/ acute MI) should be transported preferably to a facility capable of emergent cardiac catheterization or, as a secondary option, to a STEMI receiving facility based upon local resources and system of care 9. Check blood glucose a. If hypoglycemic, treat per Hypoglycemia Guideline b. If hyperglycemic, notify hospital on arrival NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Adult Post -ROSC (Return of Spontaneous Circulatio n) Care 127 Version 3.0 10. If patient seizes, treat per Seizures Guideline 11. Consider transporting patients to an age -appropriate facility which offers specialized adult or pediatric post -resuscitation care Patient Safety Considerations 1. Avoid hyperthermia (temperature greater than 37.5 \u00b0 C or 99.5 \u00b0 F) by avoiding excessive environmental heat exposure, warm blankets, etc . a. Beyond interventions to prevent hyperthermia or fever, prehospital initiation of therapeutic hypothermia (targeted temperature management) is not routinely recommended Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Hyperventilation is a significant cause of hypotension and recurrence of cardiac arrest in the post resuscitation phase and must be avoided. Similarly, hypoventilation (suggested by an EtCO 2 greater than 40-45) contributes to worsening acidosis and may precipitate re -arrest 2. Most patients are comatose immediately after resuscitation and will require airway management and ventilatory assistance 3. Many patients experience \"stunning\" of the cardiac muscle after ROSC. Hypotension is common, and volume resuscitation or vasopressor support is often required. Refer to the [Shock Guideline ] for further recommendations 4. Common non -cardiac causes of post -resuscitation hypotension include hyperve ntilation, hypovolemia, and traumatic pneumothorax from chest compressions 5. The condition of post -resuscitation patients fluctuates rapidly and continuously requiring close monitoring. A significant percentage of post -ROSC patients will re -arrest 6. Current re search has demonstrated that care of patients with ROSC at specialized centers is associated with both decreased mortality and improved neurologic outcomes 7. Maintain mechanical CPR device in place in preparation for re -arrest 8. A moderate number of adult post -ROSC patients may have transient ST -elevation on EKG Consider performing serial EKGs.

Patients must have one of the following documents or a valid alternative (such as identification bracelet indicating wishes) immediately available. Note that some specifics can vary widely from state to state: a. Physician Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (POLST) or Medical Orders for Life Sustaining Treatment (MOLST) - explicitly describes acceptable interventions for the patient in the form of medical orders, must be signed by a physician or other empowered medical clinician to be valid b. Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) order - identifies that CPR and intubation are not to be initiated if the patient is in arrest or peri -arrest. The interventions covered by this order and the details around when to implement them can vary widely c. Advanc e directives - document that describes acceptable treatments under a variable number of clinical situations including some or all the following: what to do for cardiac arrest, whether artificial nutrition is acceptable, organ donation wishes, dialysis, and other parameters. The directives frequently do not apply to emergent or potentially transient medical conditions d. As specified from state to state, in the absence of formal written directions (MOLST, POLST, DNR, advanced directives), and in the presence of a person with power of attorney for healthcare or healthcare proxy, that person may prescribe limits of treatment 2. One of the documents above is valid when it meets all the following criteria: a. Conforms to the state specifications for color and construction b. Is intact: it has not been cut, broken or shows signs of being repaired c. Displays the patient's name and , if required by state law or regulation, the physician's name 3. If there is question about the validity of the form/instrument, the best course of action is to proceed with the resuscitation until additional information can be obtained to clarify the best course of action 4. If a patient has a valid version of one of the above documents, it will be referred to as a \"valid exclusion to resuscitation\" for the purposes of this protocol Patient Management Assessment 1. If the patient has a valid exclusion to resuscitation, then no CPR or airway management should be attempted, however this does not exclude comfort measures including medications for NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev.

If there is a valid exclusion to resuscitation and there are signs of life (pulse and respirations), EMS clinician s should provide standard appropriate treatment under exi sting protocols according to the patient's condition a. If the patient has a MOLST or POLST, it may provide specific guidance on how to proceed in this situation b. Directives should be followed as closely as possible and medical direction contacted as needed 2. The patient should receive full treatment per protocols with the exception of any intervention specifically prohibited in the patient's valid exclusion to resuscitation 3.

If there is a personal physician present at the scene who has an ongoing relationship with the patient, that physician may decide if resuscitation is to be initiated 2. If there is a registered nurse from a home healthcare or hospice agency present at the scene who has an ongoing relationship with the patient and who is operating under orders from the patient's private physician, that nurse (authorized nurse) may decide if resuscitation is to be initiated 3.

March 2022 Termination of Resuscitative Efforts 136 Version 3.0 Termination of Resuscitative Efforts Aliases Call the code Patient Care Goals 1. When there is no response to prehospital cardiac arrest treatment, it is acceptable and often preferable to cease futile resuscitation efforts in the field 2. In patients with cardiac arrest, prehospital resuscitation is initiated with the goal of returning spontaneous circulation before permanent neurologic damage occurs. In most situations, ALS clinician s are capable of performing an initial resuscitation that is equivalent to an in -hospital resuscitation attempt, and there is usually no additional benefit to emergency department resuscitation in most cases 3. CPR that is performed during patient packaging and transport is much less effective than CPR done at the scene. Additionally, EMS clinicians risk physical injury while attempting to perform CPR in a moving ambulance while unrestrained. In addition, continuing resuscitation in futile cases places other motorists and pedestrians at risk, increases the time that EMS crews are not available for another call, impedes emergency department care of other patients, and incurs unnecessary hospital charges. Lastly, return of spontaneous circulation is dependent on a focused, timely resuscitation. The patient in arrest sh ould be treated as expeditiously as possible, including quality, uninterrupted CPR and timely defibrillation as indicated 4. When cardiac arrest resuscitation becomes futile, the patient's family should become the focus of the EMS clinician s. Families need to be informed of what is being done and that transporting all cardiac arrest patients to the hospital is not supported by evidence . This practice also inconveniences the family by requiring a trip to the hospital where they must begin grieving in an unfami liar setting. Most families understand the futility of the situation and are accepting of ceasing resuscitation efforts in the field 5. Consider potential for organ donation if feasible. Patient Presentation Patient in cardiac arrest Inclusion Criteria 1. Any cardiac arrest patient that has received resuscitation in the field but has not responded to treatment 2. When resuscitation has begun and it is found that the patient has a DNR order or other actionable medical order (e.g. , POLST/MOLST form) Exclusion Crite ria Consider continuing resuscitation for patients in cardiac arrest associated with medical conditions that may have a better outcome despite prolonged resuscitation, including hypothermia (although under certain circumstances, medical direction may order termination of resuscitation in these conditions) Patient Management Resuscitation may be terminated under the following circumstances: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Termination of Resuscitative Efforts 137 Version 3.0 1. Non-traumatic arrest a. Patient is at least 18 years of age b. Patient is in cardiac arrest at the time of arrival of advanced life support (ALS) i. No pulse ii. No respirations iii. No evidence of meaningful cardiac activity (e.g. , asystole or wide complex PEA less than 60 BPM, no heart sounds) c. ALS resuscitation is administered appropriate to the presenting and persistent cardiac rhythm. i. Resuscitation may be terminated in asystole and slow wide complex PEA if there is 1. No return of spontaneous circulation after 20 minutes in the absence of hypothermia AND 2. The EtCO 2 is less than 20 mmHg ii. Narrow complex PEA with a rate above 40 or refractory and recurrent ventricular fibrillation/ventricular tachycardia: 1. Consider resuscita tion for up to 60 minutes from the time of dispatch. 2. Termination efforts may be ceased before 60 minutes based on factors including , but not limited to , EtCO 2 less than 20 mmHg, age, co -morbidities, distance from, and resources available at the closest hospital. Termination before this timeframe should be done in consultation with online medical direction d. There is no return of spontaneous pulse and no evidence of neurological function (non - reactive pupils, no response to pain, no spontaneous movement) e. No evidence or suspicion of hypothermia f. All EMS clinicians involved in the patient's care agree that discontinuation of the resuscitation is appropriate g. Consider cont acting medical direction before termination of resuscitative efforts 2. Traumatic arrest a. Patient is at least 18 years of age b. Resuscitation efforts may be terminated in any blunt trauma patient who, based on thorough primary assessment, is found apneic, pulsel ess, and asystolic on an EKG or cardiac monitor upon arrival of emergency medical services at the scene c. Victims of penetrating trauma found apneic and pulseless by EMS should be rapidly assessed for the presence of other signs of life, such as pupillary re flexes, spontaneous movement, response to pain, and electrical activity on EKG i. Resuscitation may be terminated by contacting medical direction oversight if these signs of life are absent ii. If resuscitation is not terminated, transport is indicated d. Cardiopul monary arrest patients in whom mechanism of injury does not correlate with clinical condition, suggesting a non -traumatic cause of arrest, should have standard ALS resuscitation initiated e. All EMS personnel involved in the patient's care agree that disconti nuation of the resuscitation is appropriate f. Consider contacting medical direction before termination of resuscitative efforts Assessment 1. Pulse NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Termination of Resuscitative Efforts 138 Version 3.0 2. Respirations 3. Neurologic status assessment [ See Appendix VII. Neurologic Status Assessment ; purposeful movement, pupillary response] 4. Cardiac activity (cardiac auscultation , cardiac monitoring, and/or , if available, ultrasonography) 5. Quantitative capnography Treatment and Interventions 1. Focus on continuous, quality CPR that is initiated as soon as possible 2. Focus attention on the family and/or bystanders. Explain the rationale for termination 3. Consider support for family members such as other family, friends, cl ergy, faith leaders, or chaplains 4. For patients that are less than 18 y ears of age , consultation with medical direction is recommended Patient Safety Considerations All patients who are found in ventricular fibrillation or whose rhythm changes to ventricular fibrillation should in general have full resuscitation continued on scene Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations and Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Recent evidence has shown that , to capture over 99% of potential survivors from medical cardiac arrest (especially VF and pulseless VT arrests), resuscitation should be continued for approximately 40 minutes. This does not imply, however, that all resuscitations should continue this long ( e.g., asystolic rhythms) 2. In remote or wilderness situatio ns, EMS clinician s should make every effort to contact medical direction , but resuscitation may be terminated in the field without contacting medical direction when the following have occurred : a. There has been no return of pulse despite greater than 30 minutes of CPR (this does not apply in the case of hypothermia) b. Transport to an emergency department will take greater than 30 minutes (this does not apply in the case of hypothermia) c. EMS clinician s are exhausted, and it is physically impossible to continue the resuscitation 3. Logistical factors should be considered, such as collapse in a public place, family wishes, and safety of the crew and public 4. Survival and functional neurologic outcomes are unlikely if ROSC is not obtained by EMS. It is dangerous to crew, pedestrians, and other motorists to attempt to resuscitate a patient during ambulance transport 5. Quantitative EtCO 2 measurements of less than 10 mmHg or falling greater than 25% despite resus citation indicates a poor prognosis and provide additional support for termination Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914055 - General - Cardiac Arrest 9914087 - Injury - Cardiac Arrest 9914169 - Cardiac Arrest - Do Not Resuscitate NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev.

Return of spontaneous circulation 2. Treatment and resolution of the underlying pathophysiology leading to the traumatic cardiac arrest 3. When appropriate, transport to the closest and most capable hospital within the defined trauma system Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Patients suffering blunt or penetrating trauma with cardiac arrest after arrival of EMS clinicians or while under the care of EMS clinicians (witnessed arrest or recent arrest with continued signs of life) Exclusion Criteria 1. When the mechanism of injury does not correlate with the c linical condition, suggesting a nontraumatic cause of cardiac arrest, standard resuscitative measures should be followed. In such cases, refer to the Resuscitation Section 2. In victims of blunt or penetrating trauma with pul ses or other signs of life on EMS clinician assessment refer to the General Trauma Management Guideline 3. In victims of blunt or penetrating trauma with rigor mortis, lividity, or evidence of injuries incompatible with life (including decapitation, hemicorporectomy). In such cases, refer to Determination o f Death/Withholding Resuscitative Efforts Guideline 4. Resuscitation efforts may be withheld in any blunt trauma patient who, based on thorough primary assessment, is found apneic, pulseless, and asystolic on an EKG or cardiac monitor upon arrival of emergency medical services at the scene. In such cases, refer to the Determination of Death/Withholding Resuscitative Efforts Guideline 5. Resuscitation efforts may be withheld in victims of penetrating trauma found apneic, pulseless , and without other signs of life including pupillary reflexes, respiratory effor t, spontaneous movement, response to pain, and electrical activity on EKG. In such cases, refer to the Determination of Death/Withholding Resuscitative Efforts Guideline Patient Management Assessment 1. Management of traumatic cardiac arrest requires a balance of rapid, focused evaluation followed by prompt treatment of reversible life threats, including management of massive hemorrhage, airway management, decompression of tension pneumothorax , and resu scitation 2. Assess for signs of life, including pulses, respiratory effort, and evaluation of other signs of life 3. Assess for evidence of massive hemorrhage a. Including evidence of massive external hemorrhage NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Resuscitation Rev. March 2022 Resuscitation in Traumatic Cardiac Arrest 142 Version 3.0 b. Evidence of pelvic injury (such as instability) 4. Assess the patient's airway 5. Assess the patient's respiratory effort, if present, or for evidence of tension pneumothorax 6. Assess vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment) Treatment and Interventions 1. Manage massive hemorrhage. Refer to General Trauma Management Guideline for complete list of therapies for the treatment of massive hemorrhage, including the following : a. Place tourniquets for wounds amenable to tourniquet placement b. Use a combination of wound packing and direct pressure for junctional wounds or junctional tourniquets if available c. Place a pelvic binder on all patients with blunt or blast trauma suffering traumatic arrest 2. Manage the patient's air way. Refer to the Airway Management Guideline 3. Perform bilateral, rapid chest decompression 4. Establish intravenous access 5. Initiate volume resuscitation and adjunctive hemorrhage control measures (such as tranexamic acid (TXA) ) en route to the hospital Patient Safety Considerations None noted Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Survival from traumatic cardiac arrest requires careful coordination between rapid prehospital assessment, EMS clinician treatment of reversible causes of traumatic cardiac arrest and transport that is rapid, but also allows maintenance of necessary therap ies in a manner that is effective for patients as well as safe for EMS clinicians 2. Evidence for the benefit of CPR in traumatic cardiac arrest is limited. Treatment priorities should initially focus on control of massive hemorrhage (including management of pelvis fractures), airway management, and consideration of bilateral needle thoracostomy. I f CPR is performed at all, it should be performed en route to the hospital but only if it can be performed in a safe and effective manner by EMS clinicians 3. Unless th ere is an immediate and correctable cause, patients suffering traumatic cardiac arrest have the best chance for survival when arrival time to a hospital is within minutes 4. If transport is initiated, consider the ACS-COT's Once the above treatments and inter ventions have been performed, patients should be transported to the closest appropriate hospital within the defined trauma system 5. In an effort to reduce on -scene time, consider IV/IO access and initiation of resuscitation during transport 6. Optimal choices f or resuscitation are (in descending order as available ) as follows : whole blood, balanced blood products (red blood cells ( RBC), plasma) , packed red blood cells alone, liquid, or freeze -dried plasma alone, no fluid resuscitation. Excessive crystalloid and colloid have little to no value and may in fact be harmful in hemorrhagic shock 7. Consider the duration of resuscitation and transport, contact online medical direction if available to discuss.

Noisy or labored breathing 2. Identifiable cause for the event, such as: a. Gastric reflux (spitting up) b. Swallowing dysfunction c. Nasal congestion or exce ssive secretions from the nose and/or mouth d. Periodic breathing of the newborn e. Breath -holding spell f. Change in tone associated with choking, gagging, crying, feeding g. Seizure (e.g., eye deviation, nystagmus, tonic -clonic activity) h. Hypoglycemia i. Significant pas t medical history (e.g., congenital heart disease, pulmonary disease, VP shunt , or seizure disorder) j. Need for IV medication administration 3. History or exam concerning for child abuse or neglect 4. Color change that involved only redness ( e.g., in the face) or isolated hands/feet cyanosis NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Pediatric -Specific Guidelines Rev. March 2022 Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) & Acute Events in Infants 145 Version 3.0 Patient Management Assessment 1. History a. History of circumstances and symptoms before, during, and after the event, including duration, interventions done, as well as patient color, tone, breathing, feeding, posi tion, location, activity, and level of consciousness b. Other concurrent symptoms (e.g., fever, congestion, cough, rhinorrhea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, labored breathing, fussy, less active, poor sleep, poor feeding) c.

Past medical history (e.g., prematurity, prenatal/birth complications, gastric reflux, congenital heart disease, developmental delay, airway abnormalities, breathing problems, prior hospitalizations, surgeries, or injuries) e. Family history of sudden unexplained death or cardiac arrhythmia in other children or young adults f. Social history: those living at home, recent household stressors, exposure s to toxins/drugs, sick contacts g. Considerations for possible child abuse ( i.e., multiple/changing ver sions of the story or reported mechanism of injury does not seem plausible, especially for child's developmental stage) [ See Abuse and Maltreatment Guideline ] 2. Exam a. Full set of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, r espiratory rate, neurologic status assessment) b. General assessment: i. Signs of respiratory distress or increased work of breathing ( e.g., tachypnea, grunting or other abnormal breath sounds, nasal flaring, retracting, or head bobbing) ii.

Suction excessive secretions from the nose and/or mouth (using bulb syringe or suction catheter) [ See Pediatric Respiratory Distress (Bronchiolitis) Guideline ] 3. Utility of IV placement and fluids a. Routine IVs should not be placed on all suspected BRUE patients b. IVs should be placed only for clinical concerns of shock or to administer IV medications NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Pediatric -Specific Guidelines Rev. March 2022 Brief Resolved Unexplained Event (BRUE) & Acute Events in Infants 146 Version 3.0 4. Transport the patient to the appropriate facility even if they appear well or have returned to their baseline Patient Safety Considerations 1. Regardless of the patient's well appearance, all infants with a history of s igns or symptoms suggestive of BRUE should be transported for further evaluation a. By definition, infants who are not completely well -appearing at EMS evaluation do not meet the definition of possible BRUE and should be treated and transported according to local guidelines 2. Destination considerations a. All patients should be transported to facilities with at least baseline pediatric readiness, i.e., appropriate equipment, resources, and trained staff capable of providing initial emergency care and stabilization to pediatric patients prior to hospital admission or interfacility transfer, if feasible b. Consider transport to a facility with pediatri c critical care capability for patients with any high -risk criteria : Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. BRUE is a group of symptoms, not a disease process 2. If the infant is not completely well upon EMS arrival, this excludes possible BRUE event: a. Treat and transport according to local guidelines 3. Avoid using \"BRUE\", \"ALTE\", \"SIDS\" (sudden infant death syndrome) , or \"near -miss SIDS\" terminology with parent/guardian 4. EMS clinicians play a unique and important role in obtaining an accurate history soon after the event and in observing, documenting , and reporting environmental, scene and social indicators that may point to an alternate diagnosis 5. High -risk patients with a possible BRUE have worse outcomes and may require emergency department ( ED) or inpatient testin g, intervention, and/or follow -up 6. The determination of a BRUE is made only after hospital evaluation, not in the field: a. A few of these infants will die even after hospital evaluation and treatment 7. All patients should be transported to an ED 8. Contact medical direction if parent/guardian is refusing medical care and/or transport, especially if any high -risk criteria are present Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914197 - Medical - Apparent Life-Threatening Event (ALTE) i.

Full se t of vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment ) temperature, and O2 saturation b. Air entry (normal vs. diminished) c. Breath sounds (wheezes, crackles, rales, rhonchi, diminished, clear) d. Signs of distress (grunting, nasal flaring, retracting, accessory muscle use ) e. Weak cry or inability to speak full sentences (sign of shortness of breath) f. Color (pallor, cyanosis, normal) g. Mental status (alert, tired, lethargic, unresponsive) h. Hydration status (+/ - sunken eyes , vs. tacky ), fontanel (flat vs. sunken )) Treatment and Interventions 1. Pulse oximetry and end-tidal capnography ( EtCO 2) should be routinely used as an adjunct to other forms of respiratory monitoring 2. Perform EKG only if there are no signs of clinical improvement after treating respiratory distress 3. Airway a. Give supplemental oxygen - escalate from a nasal cannula to a simple face mask to a non - breather mask as needed, to maintain normal oxygenation (goal SpO 2 94-98% ) b. Suction the nose and/or mouth (via bulb or suction catheter) particularly if excessive secretions are present 4. Inhaled medications - nebulized epinephrine 5 mg (5 mL of 1 mg/mL solution ) should be administered to children in severe respiratory distress with bronchiolitis in the prehospital setting if other treatments (e.g. , suctioning, oxygen) fail to result in clinical improvement; if immediate reassessment after treatment does not demonstrate clinical improvement, airway management should be escalated as necessary ( see below and refer to Airway Management Guideline ) 5. Utility of IV placement and flu ids. IVs should only be placed in children with respiratory distress for clinical concerns of dehydration, or when administering IV medications. Otherwise, IV access is not routinely needed in bronchiolitis. 6. Steroids are not efficacious and should not be g iven 7. Improvement of oxygenation and/or respiratory distress with non -invasive airway adjuncts 8. Supraglottic devices and intubation a. Supraglottic devices and intubation should be utilized only if bag -valve -mask (BVM) ventilation fails b. The airway should be managed in the least invasive way possible Patient Safety Considerations Routine use of lights and sirens is not recommended durin g transport a. High flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) can be administered, when available, for severe respiratory distress b. Bag-valve -mask ventilation should be utiliz ed in children with respiratory failure or impending respiratory failure NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Pediatric -Specific Guidelines Rev. March 2022 Pediatric Respiratory Distress (Bronchiolitis) 152 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Suctioning can be a very effective intervention to alleviate distress since infants are obligate nose breathers 2. Heliox should not be routinely administered to children with respiratory distress 3. Insufficient data exist to recommend the use of inhaled steam or nebulized saline 4. Although albuterol and steroids have previously been a consideration, the most recent evidence does not demonstrate a benefit in routine use of albuterol or steroids for bronch iolitis 5. Ipratropium and other ant icholi nergic agents should not be given to children with bronchiolitis in the prehospital se tting 6. Although nebulized hyper tonic sali ne has been shown to decrease hospital length of stay when used for bronchiolitis, it does not provide immediate relief of distress and should not be administered to ch ildren in respiratory distress in the prehospital setting Pertinent Assessment Findings Frequent reassessment is necessary to determine if interventions have alleviated signs of respiratory distress .

Resuscitation 159 Version 3.0 Neonatal Resuscitation Aliases None noted Patient Care Goals 1. Plan for resources based on number of anticipated patients (e.g., mother and newborn or multiple births) 2. Provide routine care to the newly born infant 3. Perform a neonatal assessment 4. Rapidly identify newly born infants requiring resuscitative efforts 5. Provide appropriate interventions to minimize distress in the newly born infant 6. Recognize the need for additional resources based on patient condition and/or environmental factors Patient Present ation Inclusion Criteria Newly born infants Exclusion Criteria Documented gestational age less than 20 weeks (usually calculated by date of last menstrual period). If any doubt about accuracy of gestational age, initiate resuscitation Patient Management Assessment 1. History a. Date and time of birth b. Onset of symptoms c. Prenatal history (prenatal care, substance abuse, multiple gestation, maternal illness) d. Birth history (maternal fever, presence of meconium, maternal bleeding, difficult delivery (e.g., shoulder dystocia, prolapsed or nuchal cord, breech)) e. Estimated gestational age (may be based on last menstrual period) 2. Exam a. Respiratory rate and effort (strong, weak, or absent; regular or irregular) b. Signs of respiratory distress (grunting, nasal flaring , retractions, gasping, apnea) c. Heart rate (fast, slow, or absent) i. Precordium, umbilical stump, or brachial pulse may be used (auscultation of chest is preferred since palpation of umbilical stump is less accurate) d. Muscle tone (poor or strong) e. Color/Appear ance (central cyanosis, acrocyanosis, pallor, normal) f. APGAR score ( Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiratory effort) \u2014 may be calculated for documentation, but not necessary to guide resuscitative efforts g. Estimated gestational age (term, late preterm, premature) h. Pulse oximetry should be considered if resuscitative efforts are initiated or if supplemental oxygen is adminis tered NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Pediatric -Specific Guidelines Rev. March 2022 Neonatal Resuscitation 160 Version 3.0 Treatment and Interventions 1. If immediate resuscitation is required and the newborn is still attached to the mother, clamp the cord in two places and cut between the clamps. If no resuscitation is required, warm/dry/stimulate the newborn, and then c ut/clamp the cord after 60 seconds or the cord stops pulsating 2. Dry, warm, and stimulate a. Wrap infant in dry towel or thermal blanket to keep infant as warm as possible during resuscitation; keep head covered if possible b. If strong cry, regular respiratory ef fort, good tone, and term gestation, infant should be placed skin -to-skin with mother and covered with dry linen 3. If weak cry, signs of respiratory distress, poor tone, or preterm gestation then position airway (sniffing position) and clear airway as needed . If signs of respiratory distress with airway obstruction, suction mouth then nose; routine suctioning is not recommended 4. Apply cardiac monitor , if available 5. If heart rate greater than 100 BPM a. Monitor for central cyanosis \u2014 provide blow -by oxygen as neede d b. Monitor for signs of respiratory distress. If apneic or in significant respiratory distress: i. Ventilate : BVM ventilation with room air at 40 -60 breaths per minute 1. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) with bag -mask device may be initiated with room air (21% oxygen) in term and late preterm babies; otherwise use 100% oxygen 2. Goal: SPO 2 at 10 minutes is 85 -95% ii. Consider endotracheal intubation per local guidelines 6. Evaluate : If heart rate less than 100 BPM a. Initiate BVM ventilation with room air at 40 -60 breat hs per minute for 90 seconds with room air i. Primary indicator of effective ventilation is improvement in heart rate ii. Evaluate heart rate every 30 seconds iii. Rates and volumes of ventilation required can be variable, only use the minimum necessary rate and volume to achieve chest rise and a change in heart rate; can control rate and volume by saying \"squeeze, release\" - squeeze the bag just until chest rise is indicated then release to allow for exhalation b. If no improvement after 90 seconds, change oxygen delivery to 30% FiO 2 (fraction of inspired oxygen) if blender available, otherwise 100% FiO 2 until heart rate normalizes c. Consider endotracheal intubation or supraglottic airway per local guidelines if BVM ventilation is ineffective 7. Resuscitate : If heart rate less than 60 BPM : a. Ensure effective ventilations with supplementary oxygen and adequate chest rise b. If no improvement af ter 30 seconds, initiate chest compressions \u2014 two-thumb -encircling - hands technique is preferred c. Coordinate chest compressions with positive pressure ventilation (3:1 ratio, 90 compressions and 30 breaths per minute) d. Consider endotracheal intubation or supr aglottic airway per local guidelines e. Administer epinephrine (0.1 mg/mL) 0.01 mg/kg IV/IO (preferable if access obtained) or 0.1 mg/kg via the ETT (if unable to obtain access) q 3-5 min if heart rate remains less than 60 BPM NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Pediatric -Specific Guidelines Rev. March 2022 Neonatal Resuscitation 161 Version 3.0 8. Consider checking a blood glucos e for ongoing resuscitation, maternal history of diabetes, ill appearing or unable to feed 9. Administer 20 mL/kg normal saline IV/IO for signs of shock or post -resuscitative care Patient Safety Considerations 1. Hypothermia is common in newborns and worsens ou tcomes of nearly all post -natal complications a. Ensure heat retention by drying the infant thoroughly, covering the head, and wrapping the baby in dry cloth b. When it does not encumber necessary assessment or required interventions, \"kangaroo care\" (i.e. , placing the infant skin -to-skin directly against mother's chest and wrapping them together) is an effective warming technique c. Newborn infants are prone to hypothermia which may lead to hypoglycemia, hypoxia , and lethargy. Aggressive warming techniques should be initiated including drying, swaddling, and warm blankets covering body and head. When available, radiant warmers or other warming adjuncts are suggested for babies who require resuscitation, especially for preterm babies. Check blood glucose and follow Hypoglycemia Guideline as appropriate 2. During transport, neonate should be appropriately secured (e.g., secured to mother with approved neonatal restraint system, c ar seat or isolette) and mother should be appropriately secured Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Approximately 10% of newly born infants require some assistance to begin breathing at birth and 1% require resuscitation to support perfusion 2. Most newborns require only drying, warming , and stimulating to help the m transition from fetal respiration to newborn respiration. The resuscitation sequence can be remembered as Dry, Warm, and Stimulate - Ventilate - Evaluate - and Resuscitate Table 1. Assessments that are used to initiate BMV and chest compressions INTERVENTION INDICATED Blow -by Oxygen Bag-Mask (BVM) Chest Rate BPM ) > 100 60-100 < 60 Respiratory Distress/Apnea No Yes Central Cyanosis Present Yes Yes/No 3. Deliveries complicated by maternal bleeding (placenta previa, vas previa, or placental abruption) place the infant at risk for hypovolemia secondary to blood loss 4. Low birth weight infants are at high -risk for hypother mia due to heat loss NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Pediatric -Specific Guidelines Rev. March 2022 Neonatal Resuscitation 162 Version 3.0 5. Measuring the pulse oximetry on the right hand provides the most accurate oxygen saturation (SpO 2) in infants that are transitioning from fetal to normal circulation . At 60 seconds, 60% is the target with an increase of 5% every minute until 5 minutes of life when pulse oximetry is 80-85% Table 2. Projected Pulse Oximetry in Infants Over Time Time Since Birth Projected Increase in Pulse Oximeter Over Time 1 minute 60-65% 2 minutes 65-70% 3 minutes 70-75% 4 minutes 75-80% 5 minutes 80-85% 10 minutes 85-90% 6. Both hypoxia and excess oxygen administration can result in harm to the infant. If prolonged oxygen use is required, titrate to maintain an SPO 2 of 85 -95% 7. While not ideal, a larger facemask than indicated for patient size may be used to provide BVM ventila tion if an appropriately sized mask is not available . Avoid pressure over the eyes as this may result in bradycardia 8. Increase in heart rate is the most reliable indicator of effective resuscitative efforts 9. A multiple gestation delivery may require addition al resources and/or clinician s 10. There is no evidence to support the routine practice of administering sodium bicarbonate for the resuscitation of newborns 11. APGAR scoring is not critical during the resuscitation, although it may be prognostic after 20 minutes if the APGAR Score remains \"0\" despite resuscitatio n Table 3. APGAR Score Sign 0 1 2 Appearance: Blue, Pale Body pink, Extremities blue Completely pink Pulse: Absent Slow (less than l00) 100 Grimace : No response Grimace Cough or Sneeze Activity: Limp Some flexion Active motion of extremities Respirations: Absent Slow, Irregular Good, Crying Source : The Apgar Score. www.acog.org Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. It is difficult to determine gestational age in the field - if there is any doubt as to viability, resuscitation efforts should be initiated 2. Acrocyanosis, a blue discoloration of the distal extremities, is a common finding in the newly born infant transitioning to extrauterine life - this must be differentiated from central cyanosis NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Pediatric -Specific Guide lines Rev.

Recognize imminent birth 3. Plan for resources based on number of anticipated patients ( e.g., mother and child or multiple births) 4. Assist with uncomplicated delivery of term newborn 5. Recognize complicated delivery situations (e.g., nuchal or prolapsed umbilical cord, breech delivery, shoulder dystocia) and plan for management and appropriate transport destination 6. Apply appropriate techniques when an obstetric complication exists Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Imminent delivery w ith crowning Exclusion Criteria 1. Vaginal bleeding in any stage of pregnancy [ See Obstetrical/Gynecological Conditions Guideline ] 2. Emergencies in first or second trimester of pregnancy [ See Obstetrical/Gynecological Conditions Guideline ] 3. Seizure from eclampsia [ See Obstetrical/Gynecological Conditions Guideline and Eclampsia/Pre -Eclampsia Guideline ] Patient Management Assessment : 1. Signs of imminent delivery: a. Crowning or other presentation in vaginal opening b. Urge to push c. Urge to move bowels d. Mother's sense of imminent delivery 2. Signs of active labor a. Contractions b. Membrane rupture c. Bloody show Treatment and Interventions 1. If patient in labor but no signs of imminent delivery, transport to appropriate receiving facility 2. Delivery should be controlled to allow a slow controlled delivery of infant - This will prevent injury to mother NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC OB/GYN Rev. March 2022 Childbirth 166 Version 3.0 a. Support the infant's head as needed and apply gentle counterpressure to help prevent the head from suddenly popping out 3. Check for nuchal cord (i.e., around the baby's neck) a. If present, slip it over the head b. If unable to free the cord from the neck, double clamp the cord and cut between the clamps 4. Do not routinely suction the infant's airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery 5. Grasping the head with hand over the ears, gently guide head down to allow delivery of the anterior shoulder 6. Gently guide the head up to allow delivery of the posterior shoulder 7. Slowly deliver the remainder of the infant 8. After 1 minute, clamp cord about 5 -6 inches from the abdomen with two clamps; cut the cord between the clamps a. If resuscitatio n is needed, the baby can still benefit from a 1 -minute delay in cord clamping . Start resuscitation immediately after birth and then clamp and cut the cord at 1 minute b. While cord is attached, take care to ensure the baby is not significantly higher positio ned than the mother to prevent blood from flowing backwards from baby to placenta 9. Dry, warm, and stimulate infant, wrap in towel and place on maternal chest unless resuscitation needed 10. Resuscitation takes priority over recording APGAR scores. Record APGAR scores at 1 and 5 minutes once neonate is stabilized 11. After delivery of infant, suctioning (including suctioning with a bulb syringe) should be reserved for infants who have obvious obstruction to the airway or require positive pressure ventilation (follow Neonatal Resuscitation Guideline for further care of the infant) The placenta will deliver spontaneously, often within 5 -15 minutes after the infant is delivered a. Do not force the placenta to deliver; do not pull on the umbilical cord b. Contain all tissue in plastic bag and transport 12. After delivery, massaging the uterus (should be located at about the umbilicus) and allowing the infant to nurse will promote uterine contraction and help control bleeding a. Estimate mate rnal blood loss b. Treat mother for hypovolemia as needed 13. Transport infant secured to mother with approved neonatal restraint system, in car seat or isolette unless resuscitation is needed 14. Keep infant warm during transport 15. Most deliveries proceed without complications - If complications of delivery occur, apply high flow oxygen to mother and expedite transport to the appropriate receiving facility. Maternal resuscitation is critical for best fetal outcome . Contact medical direction and/or closest appropriate receiving facility for direct medical oversight and to prepare the receiving team . The following are recommendations for specific complications: a. Shoulder dystocia - if delivery fails to progress after head delivers, quickly atte mpt the following i. Hyperflex mother's hips to severe supine knee -chest position (i.e., McRoberts' maneuver) ii. Apply firm suprapubic pressure to attempt to dislodge shoulder . This often requires two EMS clinicians to perform and allows for delivery in up to 7 5% of cases iii. Attempt to angle baby's head as posteriorly as possible but NEVER pull NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC OB/GYN Rev. March 2022 Childbirth 167 Version 3.0 iv. Continue with delivery as normal once the anterior shoulder is delivered b. Prolapsed umbilical cord i. Placed gloved hand into vagina and gently lift head/body off the cord 1. Asses s for pulsations in cord, if no pulses are felt, lift the presenting part off the cord 2. Wrap the prolapsed cord in moist sterile gauze 3. Maintain until relieved by hospital staff ii. If previous techniques are not successful, mother should be placed in prone knee - chest position or extreme Trendelenburg with hips elevated c. Breech birth i. Place mother supine, allow the buttocks, feet, and trunk to deliver spontaneously, then support the body while the head is delivered ii. If needed, put the mother in a kneeling position w hich may assist in the delivery of the newborn iii. Assess for presence of prolapsed cord and treat as above iv. If head fails to deliver, place gloved hand into vagina with fingers between infant's face and uterine wall to create an open airway . Place your index and ring fingers on the baby's cheeks forming a \"V\" taking care not to block the mouth and allowing the chin to be tilted toward the chest flexing the neck v. When delivering breech, you may need to rotate the baby's trunk clockwise; or sweep the legs from the vagina vi. Once the legs are delivered support the body to avoid hyperextension of the head; keep the fetus elevated off the umbilical cord vii. NEVER pull on th e body, especially a preterm or previable baby - just support the baby's body while mother pushes when she feels the urge to d. The presentation of an arm or leg through the vagina is an indication for immediate transport to hospital e. Nuchal cord i. After the he ad has been delivered, palpate the neck for a nuchal cord, if present, slip over the head ii. If the loop is too tight to slip over the head, attempt to slip the cord over the shoulders and deliver the body through the loop iii. The cord can be doubly clamped and c ut between the clamps; the newborn should be delivered promptly f. Excessive bleeding during active labor may occur with placenta previa or placental abruption i. Obtain history from patient - known previa, recent pre -eclampsia symptoms, hypertension history, r ecent trauma, drug use especially cocaine ii. Placenta previa most likely will prevent delivery of infant vaginally iii. Place large bore IV and administer IV fluids as indicated iv. If available, transfusion or the administration of whole blood as indicated v. C-Section most likely needed - transport emergently g. Postpartum hemorrhage i. Obtain history from patient - history of prenatal or delivery complications, recent trauma, prescription anticoagulants, drug use especially cocaine ii. Perform fundal massage NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC OB/GYN Rev. March 2022 Childbirt h 168 Version 3.0 iii. Initiate IV fluid resuscitation and, if approved by medical direction, transfuse blood products iv. Consider administration of tranexamic acid ( TXA) v. Although recommended following all deliveries, if postpartum hemorrhage occurs following delivery, consider administrati on of oxytocin h. Maternal cardiac arrest i. Apply manual pressure to displace uterus from midline ii. Treat per the Cardiac Arrest Guideline (VF/VT/Asystole/PEA) for resuscitation care (defibrillation and medications should be given for same indications and doses as if non-pregnant patient) iii. Transport as soon as possible if infant is estimated to be over 24 weeks gestation (perimortem Cesarean section (also known as resuscitative hysterot omy) at receiving facility is most successful if started within 5 minutes of maternal cardiac arrest) Patient Safety Considerations 1. Supine Hypotension Syndrome: a. If mother has hypotension before delivery, place patient in left lateral recumbent position or manually displace gravid uterus to the left in supine position b. Knee -chest position may create safety issues during rapid ambulance transport 2. Do not routinely suction the infant's airway (even with a bulb syringe) during delivery 3. Newborns are very slipp ery, take care not to drop the infant 4. Dry, warm and stimulate all newborns to facilitate respirations and prevent hypothermia 5. Do not pull on the umbilical cord while the placenta is delivering 6. If possible, transport between deliveries if mother is expectin g twins Notes/Educational Pearls 1. OB assessment: a. Length of pregnancy b. Number of pregnancies c. Number of viable births d. Number of non -viable births e. Due date (calculate gestational age in weeks) i. If unknown gestational age, rough estimated gestational age with palpation of the uterine fundus at the umbilicus is 20 weeks f. Last menstrual period i. Only ask for estimated last menstrual period (first day of last period) if patient has not had prenatal care/ultrasound and does not know their due date. g. Prenatal care h. Number of expected babies (multiple gestations) i. Drug use and maternal medication use j. Any known pregnancy complications - hypertension, gestational diabetes, placenta previa, premature labor, history of fetal demise, fetal anomalies/birth defects, etc . k. Signs of imminent delivery ( e.g., crowning, urge to push, urge to move bowels, mother feels delivery is imminent) l. Location where patient receives care (considered a preferred destination if time delay is not an issue and based on local protocols) 2. Notify medical direction /receiving facility if: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC OB/GYN Rev. March 2022 hemorrhage b. Postpartum hemorrhage c.

Secondary survey pertinent to obstetric issues: a. Constitutional: vital signs, skin color b. Abdomen: distension, tenderness, uterine rigidity c. Genitourinary: visible bleeding d. Neurologic: mental status, focal deficits Treatment and Interventions 1. Severe hypertension (SBP greater than 160 or DBP greater than 110) lasting more than 15 min with associated preeclampsia symptoms a. Severely elevated blood pressures must be treated to reduce the risk of maternal stroke b. However, goal blood pressure should be roughly 140/90 to maintain uterine perfusion and to keep fetus well -oxygenated c. Goal BP is approximately 140/90 to reduce stroke risk but maintain uterine perfusion i. Labetalol 20 mg IV over 2 min utes 1.

March 2022 Airway Management 178 Version 3.0 Respiratory Airway Management Patient Care Goals 1. Maintain a patent airway 2. Provide effective oxygenation and adequate ventilation using the least invasive possible method to achieve those goals paired with pulse oximetry and end-tidal capnography (EtCO 2) data 3. Anticipate, recognize, and alleviate respiratory distress 4. Provide necessary interventions quickly and safely to patients with the need for respiratory support 5. Anticipate, identify, and plan for a potentially difficult airway 6. Optimize the patient for any advanced airway attempts Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria 1.

Abnormal breath sounds ( e.g., wheezing, rhonchi, rales, or stridor) NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airway Management 179 Version 3.0 f. Cough g. Skin color (cyanosis or pallor), presence of diaphoresis h. Mental status, including anxiety i. Airway obstruction with foreign body or swelling ( e.g., angioedema, posterior pharyngeal and laryngeal infections) j. Signs of a difficult airway (short jaw or limited jaw thrust or mobility, small thyromental space, upper airway obstruction, large tongue, obesity, large tonsils, large neck, craniofacial abnormaliti es, excessive facial hair, tracheostomy scar or evidence of other neck/facial surgery, trismus) k. Signs of fluid overload ( e.g., ascites, peripheral edema) l. Traumatic injuries impairing upper and lower airway anatomy and physiology : i. Facial injuries ii. High spine injury (affecting phrenic nerve/intercostals) iii. Neck injury (expanding hematoma, tracheal injury) iv. Chest wall injury (bruising), including rib and sternal fracture , paradoxical chest motion, subcutaneous air , sucking chest wound Monitoring 1. Patients with significant respiratory distress should have continuous pulse oximetry and waveform capnography monitoring for both assessment and for guiding therapy 2. Pulse oximetry is indicated to assess oxygenation 3. Quantitative w aveform capnography: a. Is ind icated: i. For assessment and monitoring of ventilatory status in patients with significant respiratory distress, with or without airway adjuncts ii. To assist in decision -making for patients with respiratory difficulty of unclear cause (e.g., bronchospasm vs. pulmonary edema) and to help direct therapy iii. To evaluate acid -base status in critically ill patients b. Is not indicated for every patient with shortness of breath . Rather, it is a monitoring and decision -making tool for patients with signifi cant respiratory distress where interpretation of the capnography waveform and EtCO 2 values assist in determining the appropriate course of treatment for the patient as well as the patient's response Treatment and Interventions 1. Generally, the approach is to implement the interventions below in an escalating fashion to meet the patient care goals above 2. Administer oxygen if needed for air hunger or respiratory distress and titrate to a target SPO 2 of 94-98% . Depending on patient presentation, this may be accomplished with nasal cannula, nonrebreather, BVM, NIV a. Even in apneic patients, starting passive oxygenation while escalating interventions are implemented may be useful b. During CPR, maximal oxygen supplementation should be provided c. Consider humidified ox ygen for patients with tracheostomy ( See Tracheostomy Management Guideline ) 3. Open and maintain patent airway . If needed, a. Provide head tilt /chin lift, or jaw thrust if concern for potential spinal injury NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airw ay Management 180 Version 3.0 b. Suction airway: for significantly contaminated airways, consider utilizing a suction assisted laryngeal airway decontamination ( SALAD ) technique c. Oropharyngeal airways (OPA) or nasopharyngeal airways (NPA) can be placed if needed to maintain a patent airway and make BVM ventilation more effective i. OPA are used for patients without gag reflex ii. NPA are used for patients with gag reflex d. Patient position ing can significantly impact respiratory mechanics . Patients with severe bronchospasm should be left in the position of comfort (perhaps tripod) whenever possible . Elevating the head or padding (shoulders, occiput) can assist with opening airway and respir atory mechanics . This can both improve the ability to ventilate and limit aspiration e. For patients with tracheostomy in respiratory distress, see Tracheostomy Management Guideline 4. Use bag-valve -mask (BVM) ventilation in the setting of respiratory failure or arrest . Whenever possible, the patient's head should be elevated up to 30 degrees a. Two -person, two -thumbs -up BVM ventilation is preferred b. PEEP should be used with BVM i. 5 cmH 20 is generally an appropriate i nitial PEEP setting ii. Increase PEEP in stepwise fashion (2 -3 cmH 20 at a time) as necessary, allowing time for the patient to equilibrate with each change before further adjustments are made. The goal is to reach the lowest PEEP needed to adequately ventilate the patient. Higher PEEP results in greater negative hemodynamic impact . Generally, physician consultation should be considered for higher PEEP levels (greater than 10 -15 cmH 20) c. Continuous wave -form capnography monitoring should be placed in line i. In patie nts without primary pulmonary pathology ( i.e., acute respiratory distress syndrome ( ARDS ), COPD), maintain EtCO 2 of no less than 35 and up to 40 mmHg . Patients with specific disease processes such as acute acid -base disorders (i.e., DKA, lactic acidosis due to severe sepsis or trauma), acute respiratory failure due to primary pulmonary pathology, or post -cardiac arrest will have different EtCO 2 parameter s due to their underlying diseas e ii. In patients with severe head injury with signs of herniation (unilateral dilated pupil or decerebrate posturing), modest hyperventilation to EtCO 2 no less than 30 mmHg may be considered for a brief time d. Tidal volume: i. Venti late with just enough volume to see chest rise, approximately 6 -8 mL/kg ideal body weight ii. Over -inflation (e.g., excessive tidal volume) and overventilation ( e.g., excessive minute ventilation) are both undesirable and potentially harmful e. Rate i. Adult : 10-12 breaths/minute ii. Child : 20-30 breaths/minute iii. Infant : 20-30 breaths/minute f. Continuously monitor EtCO 2 to guide tidal volume and minute ventilation 5. Non -invasive ventilation (NIV ) should be considered early for severe respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airway Management 181 Version 3.0 a. NIV options include continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP) , nasal cannula (HFNC) b. NIV can also be used to improve oxygenation pre -intubat ion in some patients with respiratory failure 6. Supraglottic airways (SGA) : Consider the use of an appropriately sized SGA if BVM (with OPA/NPA) alone is not effective in maintaining oxygenat ion and/or ventilation. This is especially important in children as prehospital endotracheal intubation is an infrequently performed skill in this age group and has not been shown to improve outcomes over prehospital BVM or SGA 7. Endotracheal methods (two -person BVM, SGA placement) are ineffective or inappropriate, consider endotracheal intubation to maintain oxygenation and/or ventilation . Other indications may include potential airway obstruction, severe inhalation burns, multiple traumatic injuries, altered mental status with loss of normal protective airway reflexes b. Optimize patient for first -pass success with pre -procedure resuscitation, preoxygenation, positioning, sedatives and paralytics as indicated by patient presentation i. A bougie may be a helpful adjunct to successful airw ay placement, especially when video laryngoscopy is unavailable and the glottic opening is difficult to visualize with direct laryngoscopy ii. For experienced EMS clinicians , video laryngoscopy may enhance intubation success rates and should be used when avail able c. Monitor clinical signs, pulse oximetry, cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, and waveform capnography for the intubated patient d. For adults, the largest tube size possible should be placed in the patient to limit difficulty with mechanical ventilation and h igh airway pressures . Absent significant airway swelling or underlying anatomic abnormalities, initial tube size (internal diameter in millimeters) for adult females should be 7.5, adult males 8.0 . For pediatrics, cuffed tubes are now recommended 8. Post -intubation management a. Inflate endotracheal tube cuff with minimum air to seal airway. An ETT cuff manometer can be used to measure and adjust the ETT cuff pressure to the recommended 20 cmH 20 pressure b. Confirm placement of advanced airway (endotracheal tube, SGA) with waveform capnography (most reliable), absent gastric sounds, and bilateral breath sounds c. Secure tube manually. Once proper position is confirmed, secure the tube with tape, twill, or commercial device i. Note measurement of tube at incisors or gum line and assess frequently for tube movement/displacement using continuous waveform capnography and visual inspection ii. Cervical collar and/or cervical immobilization device may help reduce neck movement and risk of tube displacement d. Conti nuously monitor correct airway placement with waveform capnography during treatment and transport, paying particular attention to reassessing after each patient movement e. Manual ventilation (see above for rate and tidal volume guidance) f. Mechanical ventilati on should be considered following advanced airway placement NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airway Management 182 Version 3.0 if available . See Mechanical Ventilation (Invasive) Guideline . g. Intubated patients should be provided appropriate sedation with sedative or opi oid medications, and sedation titrated to an appropriate target level using RASS score or similar scale h. Consider PEEP adjustment to achieve oxygenation and ventilation goals (see above) 9. Gastric decompression can improve oxygenation and ventilation, so it s hould be strongly considered in any patient with an advanced airway and positive pressure ventilation 10. When patients cannot be oxygenated/ventilated effectively using the above interventions, or when conventional airway approaches are impossible, surgical a irway management is a reasonable option if the clinician has competency in the procedure and risk of death for not escalating airway management seems to outweigh the risk of a procedural complication 11. Transport to the closest appropriate hospital for airway stabilization when respiratory failure cannot be successfully managed in the prehospital setting Patient Safety Considerations 1. Suctioning to limit aspiration is a priority, since it is associated with development of hospital acquired pneumonia and relate d increases in ICU stay and mortality. 2. Avoid excessive pressures or tidal volumes during BVM ventilation . The goal is to avoid barotrauma as well as overventilation and related reduction of venous return /preload /cardiac output. 3. Routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatment of anxiety in patients on NIV . Anxiety should be presumed due to hypoxia or inadequate minute ventilation and treated primarily with ventilatory support. 4. Endotracheal intubation should only be used if less invasive methods do not meet patient care goals . 5. Once a successful SGA placement or intubation has been performed, obstruction or displacement of the tube can have further negative effects on patient outcome . Tubes should be secured with either a commercial tube holder or tape. 6. Meticulous attention should be paid to avoiding hypoxia and hypotension during intubation attempts to limit patient morbidity and mortality. 7. Waveform capnography should be placed prior to the first breath through an invasive airway to confi rm placement. 8. Drug Assisted Airway Management (DAAM) should be reserved for specialized clinician s on operating within a comprehensive program with adequate resources, ongoing training and quality assurance measures, and close EMS physician oversight. 9. Once initiated and patient is tolerating mask, DO NOT discontinue CPAP/BiPAP until patient is on the emergency department stretcher and hospital CPAP /BiPAP is immediately available for patient to be switched over, or physician is at bedside and requesting CPAP /BiPAP be discontinued. Breaking the mask seal causes a significant decrease in airway pressures and may lead to abrupt decompensation due to atelectasis and alveolar collapse. 10. If patient deteriorates on CPAP/BiPAP ( e.g., worsened mental status, increasing EtCO 2, vomiting), remove CPAP/BiPAP and escalate airway management options as above. 11. If an endotracheal tube becomes dislodged, SGA should be strongly considered. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airway Management 183 Version 3.0 12. Pediatric airway management requires appropriately sized tools and adjuncts based on patient size/age. A method for determining appropriate sizing should be available to all EMS clinicians. a. Skill in BVM ventilation and NIV application should be emphasized in pediatrics. b. SGA are reasonable primary and secondary adjuncts if needed . c. Pediatric endotracheal intubation has unclear benefit in the prehospital setting. d. Pediatric endotracheal tube placement and maintenance requires significant training to achieve and maintain competency. Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Oxygen is a drug with an appropriate dose range and undesirable effects from both too much and too little supplementation. Effective oxygenation meets the oxygen saturation (SpO 2) target set for that specific patient in the context of their acute and chronic medica l condition(s) . Permissive hypoxia ( SPO 2 90%) may be appropriate in patients with COPD or other complex respiratory pathology 2. Adequate ventilation provides sufficient minute ventilation to meet the patient's acute respiratory and metabolic needs and is g enerally titrated to an EtCO 2 goal 3. Paramedics are less likely to attempt endotracheal intubation in children than adults with cardiac arrest and are more likely to be unsuccessful when intubating children . Complications such as malposition of the ET tube o r aspiration can be nearly three times as common in children as compared to adults 4. Continuous waveform capnography is an important adjunct in the monitoring of patients with respiratory distress, respiratory failure, and those treated with positive pressur e ventilation. It should be used as the standard to confirm placement of all advanced airways . It can also be helpful in the respiratory distress patient without an invasive airway to assess for causes of respiratory distress, adequacy of ventilation, prog ression toward respiratory failure, monitoring of BVM ventilation, as well as numerous other applications that provide insight into acute metabolic and infectious disease processes. Continuous waveform capnography: a. Should be used for patients with invasive airways for i. initial verification of correct airway placement ii. continuous evidence of correct tube placement iii. to adjust ventilatory rate 1. to maintain EtCO 2 35-45 in most patients 2. to appropriately but not excessively hyperventilate patients with signs of herniation only to maintain EtCO 2 30-35 (no lower than 30) 3. to gradually decrease EtCO 2 in chronically and acutely severely hypercarbic patients including post -arrest b. Is strongly enc ouraged in patients in cardiac arrest i. to monitor quality of CPR ii. as an early indicator of ROSC (rapid increase of 10 -15 in EtCO 2) iii. to assist in evaluating prognosis for survival c. Should be used in spontaneously breathing patients who are: i. on NIV ii. in severe re spiratory distress ( e.g., receiving epinephrine, magnesium therapy) d. In spontaneously breathing patients, waveform capnography can help with assessment of critically ill patients, for example: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airway Management 184 Version 3.0 i. assessment of adequacy of ventilation and change in ventilatory status in response to treatment ii. differentiating between severe bronchospasm ( shark fin waveform) and other causes of respiratory distress (normal waveform, pulmonary edema) iii. hypotension due to sepsis or (metabolic with /without compen satory evaluate ventilatory and acid/base status v. evaluation for acidosis in patients with altered mental status and potential diabetic ketoacidosis (metabolic acidosis) 5. Bag-valve -mask (BVM) ventilation (for cardiac arrest patients see Cardiac Arrest Guideline ): a. Appropriately sized masks should completely cover the nose and mouth and maintain an effective seal around the cheeks and chin b. Ventilations should be delivered with only sufficient volume to achieve chest rise . Overventilation is undesirable i. In children, ventilating breaths should be delivered over one second, with a two second pause between breaths c. Ventilation rate: i. Adult 1. Support spontaneous respirations if the patient is hypoventilating 2. For apnea , provide one breath every 6 seconds adjusting based on pulse oximetry and digital capnometry or capnography (with the goal of 35 -45 mmHg) ii. Pediatric - infant /child 1. Support spontaneous respirations if the patient is hypoventilating 2. For apnea, provide 1 breath every 2-3 seconds adjusting based on pulse oximetry and digital capnometry or capnography (with the goal of 35 -45 mmHg) 6. PEEP improves oxygenation or decreases risk of developing hypoxemia, by increasing functional residual capacity (FRC), and tidal ventilation and may assist in meet ing airway goals by decreasing intrapulmonary shunting of blood and better matching perfused lung to ventilated lung tissue, thus improving arterial oxygenation . It does not open fully collapsed alveoli but re -expands partially collapsed ones . It does not decrease extravascular lung water but redistributes it a. Higher levels of PEEP are particularly useful in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) b. PEEP should be increased slowly by 2 -3 cmH 20 from 5 cmH 20 to a max of 15 cmH 20 closely monitoring response and vital sign changes c. Excessive PEEP over distends alveoli, increases dead space and work of breathing, reduces lung compliance, and compresses alveolar capillaries, reducing oxygenation and risking pulmonary barotrauma d. Increa sed intrathoracic pressure can progressively decrease cardiac output and is most notable when PEEP is greater than 15 cmH 20. The higher the level of PEEP (over 5 cmH 20), the more likely the patient will experience a variety of adverse consequences, both ventilatory and hemodynamic 7. Noninvasive ventilation (NIV) (e.g., CPAP or BiPAP) : a. NIV goals of therapy will vary based on patient presentation and history. More support than is needed to relieve symptoms or \"normal\" is not necessarily better in these patients . Goals of care may include: i. Decreased air hunger NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airway Management 185 Version 3.0 ii. SPO 2 of 94%. Chronic COPD patients tolerate hypoxia better, and an SPO 2 of 90% may relieve their symptoms and be adequate iii. Normalization of respiratory rate (decreased tachypnea) iv. Normalization of EtCO 2. This means a downward trend in a patient with increased EtCO 2. Patients who have end stage COPD may have chronically elevated EtCO 2 as high as 50s -60s, and thus tolerate elevated EtCO 2 better so normalization may not be a good target b. The key to successful use of NIV in a patient who has not used it before is coaching and explanation of the process and reassurance of the patient c. For any patient on NIV, focus on maintaining a continuous mask seal is essential to maximizing the pos itive impact of PEEP, particularly at higher levels . Breaking the circuit or removing the mask should be meticulously avoided, as the significant atelectasis will occur which will take time to reverse d. Nebulized medications may be administered through a CPA P or BiPAP mask. A specialized T-connector with a spring valve assembly is required to allow maintenance of positive airway pressure 8. Orotracheal/Endotracheal intubation (ETI) a. Checklist use and use of protocolized interventions to optimize the patient physi cally and physiologically have been shown to both improve success rates of orotracheal intubation as well as decrease peri -intubation complications . Preparation should also include a promptly available plan for alternate airway placement if ETI unsuccessfu l. b. Endotracheal tube sizes (cuffed tubes preferred in pediatrics) Age Size (mm) Uncuffed Size (mm) Cuffed Premature 2.5 Term to 3 months 3.0 3-7 months 3.5 3.0 7-15 months 4.0 3.5 yrs.)/4]+4 [age( yrs.)/4]+3.5 >15 years 7.5 female 8.0 male c. Approximate depth of insertion = (3) x (endotracheal tube size) d. In addition to preoxygenation, apneic oxygenation (high -flow oxygen by nasal cannula) may prolong the period before hypoxia during an intubation attempt e. Positive pressure ventilation after intubation can decrease preload and subsequently lead to hypotension f. Significant attention should be paid to adequate preoxygenation to avoid peri -intubation hypoxia and hypoxic cardiac arrest g. Routine use of cricoid pressure is not recommended in pediatric or adult intubation h. Prompt suctioning of soiled airways before intubation attempt may improve first pass success and limit morbidity and mortality i. Confirm successful placement with waveform capnograph y. Less optimal methods of confirmation include bilateral chest rise, bilateral breath sounds, and maintenance of NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Airway Management 186 Version 3.0 adequate oxygenation. Color change on EtCO 2 is less accurate than clinical assessment, and wave -form capnography is superior. Misting observed in the tube is not a reliable method of confirmation. Re -visualization with video laryngoscopy, when available, may assist in confirming placement when unclear due to capnography failure or conflicting information j. Video laryngoscopy may be a useful tool f or endotracheal intubation in the hands of a practiced clinician 6. Manual vs. Mechanical ventilation: If mechanical ventilation is available, it is preferred to manual ventilation due to the increased consistency of tidal volume and ventilatory rate, and its ability to limit risk of overventilation . [See Mechanical Ventilation (Invasive) Guideline ] 7. For patients being transferred from a hospital ventilator to a transport ventilator, the patient's current ventilator settings are generally a reasonable starting point if the patient is being adequately oxygenated and ventilated based on pulse oximetry and capnography 8. Currently, there is limited experience with high -flow nasal cannula in the EMS enviro nment, so evidence -informed recommendations are not included in this guideline 9. Anxiety should be presumed due to hypoxia or inadequate minute ventilation and treated primarily with ventilatory support. Routine use of sedation is not recommended for treatme nt of anxiety in patients on NIV Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Ongoing assessment is critical when an airway device is in place. 2.

Grunting, stridor, inability to speak full sentences v. Nasal flaring vi. Cyanosis Treatment and Interventions 1. Airway : See Airway Management Guideline for additional specifics a. Give supplemental oxygen for dyspnea to a target of 94-98% saturation. Escalate from a nasal cannula as needed to reach this goal b. BVM ventilation should be utilized in children with respiratory failure c. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) should be administered for severe respiratory distress via BVM, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or bi -level positive airway pressure (BiPAP) d. If indicated, bronchodilators should be administered in line with NIV 2. Monitoring a. Pulse oximetry and EtCO 2 should be routinely used as adjuncts to other forms of monitoring in patients with respiratory complaints b. Continuous cardiac monitoring may be indicated i n patients with respiratory distress associated with suspected acute or decompensated congestive heart failure (CHF) or dysrhythmia c. 12-lead EKG may be indicated to assess for dysrhythmia or ischemia, particularly in patients with risk factors for coronary artery disease and/or presentation consistent with CHF 3. IV Access and Fluids - IV access should be placed when IV medication administration is indicated, or when there are clinical concerns of dehydration so that IV fluids can be administered 4. Suspected bron chospasm, asthma, COPD : a. Inhaled Medications i. While albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized is usually sufficient for mild wheezing without clinical distress, albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be administered to all patients in respiratory distress with signs of bronchospasm ( e.g., known asthmatics, quiet wheezers). Repeat at this dose with unlimited frequency for ongoing respiratory distress ii. Ipratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses in conjunction with albuterol b. Steroids should be administered in the prehospital setting i. PO steroid options for patients not critical enough to require IV placement include: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Respiratory Distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) 192 Version 3.0 1. Dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose of 16 mg) PO solution or IV solution given PO, or 2. Prednisolone/prednisone (1 mg/kg, maximum dose 60 mg) PO ii. IV steroid options for critically ill patients include: 1. Dexamethasone (0.6 mg/kg, maximum dose of 16 mg) IV/IM, or 2. Methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg, maximum dose 125 mg) IV/IM iii. Other steroids at equivalent doses may be given as alternatives c. Magnesium sulfate (40 mg/kg IV, maximum dose of 2 g) over 10 -15 minutes should be administered for severe bronchoconstriction and concern for impending respiratory failure . Consider decreased dose of 1 g IV for geriatric patients d. Epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg of 1 mg/mL solution IM, maximum dose of 0.3 mg) should only be administered for impending respiratory failure as adjunctive therapy when there are no clinical signs of improvement with the above treatments 5. Adults with s uspected pulmonary edema due to acute heart failure or fluid overload (such as dialysis noncompliance): a. Restoration of adequate oxygenation and ventilation should precede or be accomplished simultaneously with other medication therapies below i. CPAP/BiPAP : See Airway Management Guideline for goals of care and escalation of interventions b. SBP less than 100 mmHg i. IV fluid bolus 250 -500 m L ii. Consider vasopressor : Norepinephrine 0.02 -2 mcg/kg/min c. SBP less than 160 mmHg i. Nitroglycerin 1. 0.4 mg SL, can repeat every 5 minutes for SBP greater than 100 mmHg d. SBP >= 160 mmHg or MAP greater than 120 i. Nitroglycerin 1. 0.8 mg SL, can repeat every 5 minutes for SBP greater than 100 mmHg 2. Consider IV nitroglycerin infusion titrated to blood pressure 6. Suspected pulmonary edema due to other noncardiogenic causes (such as irritant inhalation, abrupt opioid withdrawal ). Provide supportive care to promote adequate oxygenation. a. Inhaled Medications i. While albuterol 2.5 mg n ebulized is usually sufficient for mild wheezing without clinical distress, albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be administered to patients in respiratory distress with signs of bronchospasm ( e.g., known asthmatics, quiet whee zers). Repeat at this dose with unlimited frequency for ongoing respiratory distress ii. Ipratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses in conjunction with albuterol Patient Safety Considerations 1. Normal EtCO 2 (35-45 mmHg ) with tachypnea and respiratory distress is an indicator of impending respiratory failure 2. The use of nitrates should be avoided in any patient who has used a phosphodiesterase inhibitor within the past 48 hours. Examples are sildenafil, vardenafil and tadalafil, which are used for erectile dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension. Also avoid use in patients receiving intravenous epoprostenol or treporstenil which are used for pulmonary hypertension NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Respiratory Distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) 193 Version 3.0 3. Invasive airways do not improve bronchospasm . The airway should be managed in the least invasive way possible . Supraglottic devices and endotracheal intubation should be considered only if BVM ventilation fails 4. Positive pressure ventilation in the setting of bronchoconstriction, either via a supraglottic airway or intubation, increases the risk of air trapping which can lead to pneumothorax and cardiovascular collapse. These interventions should be reserved for situations of respiratory failure 5. The following medications should not be administered to manage bronchosp asm as there is no evidence of patient benefit: i. Inhaled magnesium sulfate ii. Heliox Notes/Educational Pearls 1. The combination of ipratropium with albuterol may decrease the need for hospital admission in certain patients 2. Magnesium sulfate may cause hypoten sion that will usually respond to a fluid bolus 3. Patient with acute heart failure and hypotension have high mortality 4. When assessing for cause of respiratory distress, CHF tends to be associated with lower levels of EtCO 2 compared to COPD . EtCO 2 values that are extremely low and high are markers of poor outcomes and need for intubation or ICU admission Key Considerations 1. Nebulizer droplets can carry viral particles and other airborne pathogens , so additional PPE should be considered, including placement of a surgical mask over the nebulizer (if feasible) to limit droplet spread 2. Factors that have been shown to be associated with increased mortality from asthma include: a. Severe asthma as evidenced by at least one of the following: i. Prior near -fatal asthma (e.g., ICU admission or intubation /mechanical ventilation ) ii. Prior admissions for asthma or repeated ED visits, particularly if in the last year iii. Heavy use of beta -agonist medications, or requiring three or more classes of asthma medication b. Together with one or more behavioral or psychosocial contributors: i. Medication noncompliance ii. Alcohol or drug abuse iii. Obesity iv. Psychosis, depression, other psychiatric illness, or major tran quilizer use v. Employment or income difficulties vi. Severe domestic, marital, or legal stressors 3. Single dose dexamethasone has been found equally effective as several days dosing of other steroids, so dexamethasone is preferred over other po steroids 4. Acute hear t failure is a common cause of pulmonary edema - other causes include: a. Opioid overdose b. High altitude exposure c. Kidney failure or dialysis noncompliance d. Lung damage caused by gases or severe infection NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Respiratory Distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) 194 Version 3.0 5. Nitroglycerin reduces left ventricular filling pressure p rimarily via venous dilation. At higher doses the drug variably lowers systemic afterload and increases stroke volume and cardiac output 6. Pulmonary edema is more commonly a problem of volume distribution than total body fluid overload, so administration of diuretics such as furosemide provide no immediate benefit for most patients and can cause significant harm . Inducement of inappropriate diuresis can lead to increased morbidity and mortality in patients with other disease processes such as pneumonia and se psis 7. Nitrates provide both subjective and objective improvement, and might decrease intubation rates, incidence of MIs, and mortality. High -dose nitrates can reduce both preload and afterload and potentially increase cardiac output and blood pressure 8. If av ailable and trained , ultrasound is useful to distinguish pulmonary edema from other causes of respiratory distress (including pneumothorax) 9. Pulmonary edema due to irritant gas inhalation (i.e., chlorine) generally is best managed by supportive care and escalation of airway interventions as above once the patient is appropriately decontaminated . Early poison center consultation should be strongly considered for guidance 10. Pulmonary edema due to high altitude should be managed as described in Altitude Illness Guideline Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Severe respiratory distress may manifest with hypoxia, altered mentation, diaphoresis, or inability to speak more than 2 -3 words 2. In the setting of severe bronchoconstriction, wheezing may not be heard. Patients with known asthma with severe dyspnea should be empirically treated, even if wheezing is absent 3. A \"shark fin \" on waveform capnography suggests significant bronchospasm and obstructive physiology 4. Etiology respiratory distress: a. Bronchospastic etiology ( e.g., asthma, is suggested on auscultation ii. \"Shark fin \" waveform capnograph or prolonged expiratory phase iii. History of asthma/COPD b. Fluid overload etiology ( e.g., CHF, pulmonary edema) s venous distention ii. Rales on auscultation iii. edema iv.

Revision Date March NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Respiratory Dist ress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) 198 Version 3.0 Mechanical Ventilation (Invasive) Patient Care Goals 1. Maintain adequate oxygenation 2. Maintain adequate minute ventilation and capnography targets based on patient pathophysiology 3. Prevent or limit risk of short - and long -term invasive airway and ventilator -associated complications including barotrauma, pneumothorax, aspiration, over -ventilation Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Adult patients with invasive airway requiring mechanical ventilation Exclusion Criteria 1. Interfacility transfer patients with established vent settings 2. Patients with suspected untreated pneumothorax or large airway injury 3. Patients in cardiac arrest Patient Management Assessment 1. Confirm airway placement with ventilation and auscultation over epigastrium and assess for symmetric bilateral lung sounds 2. Verify that airway (ETT, SGA) is securely held in place (by holder or other method) 3. Assess oxygen d elivery and confirm that FiO 2 meets patients' needs and maintains desired oxygen saturation (SpO 2) a. If oxygen will be needed during transport calculate the duration of supply needed (O 2 tank time (min) = tank pressure ( psi) x tank conversion factor/flow rat e (L/min) 4. Assess blood pressure to assure SBP greater than 90 mmHg or resuscitate to SBP >=90 mmHg or MAP >=60 mmHg 5. Assess mental status, level of consciousness, Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale ( RASS ) or similar sedation score Treatment and Interventio ns 1. Set up ventilator and circuit, program initial ventilator settings as below . Suggested general guidelines for adults with EMS initiation of mechanical ventilation: a. Consider and modify based on any underlying acute or chronic lung pathology (COPD, asthma, CHF) b. Volume mode is generally preferred initially in adults c. Select an appropriate ventilator mode: Assist Control (AC) is acceptable for most patients NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Respiratory Distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) 199 Version 3.0 i. Initial settings: Tidal volume 6-8 mL/kg ideal body weight Go to ARDSNET table of height and Predicted Body Weight and Tidal volumes. Use 6 -8 mL/kg as a starting point . Patients with known acidosis should start with 9 mL/kg Respiratory rate 12-14 (or 8-12) breaths/min Adjust for target minute ventilation based on EtCO 2 Inspiratory time 1 second Adjust 0.7 -1.2 seconds to maintain desired I:E ratio (inspiration -expiration) ratio of 1:2 and patient comfort PEEP 5 cmH 20 FiO 2 60% Titrate to achieve target O 2 saturation ( 94-98%) Sensitivity -2 cmH 20 ii. Set the heat moisture exchange (HME) at circuit Y. iii. Plateau pressure (PPlat) goal is less than 30 cmH 20 Patient Safety Considerations 1. Ventilators have different capabilities and features . Users must be familiar with the device they use and must be properly educated on its use and application in the specific population being treated 2. Ensure that all vent alarms are set appropriately, and patient is continually monitored with pulse oximetry and wave form capnography a. Set all alarms that involve high pressure, low pressure, minute volume, and apnea b. Plateau pressure (PPlat) goal is less than 30 cmH 20 c. Set high pressure alarm 10 cmH2O above resting PIP d. Set low pressure alarm 5 cmH2O below resting PIP e. Set low minute volume alarm 25% below resting minute volume 3. During transport of a critically ill patient only necessary adjustments should be made to the ventilator . Focus on maintaining adequate oxygenation, minute volume and patient comfort. 4. An increase in t he respiratory rate shortens the expiratory time. If changing rate, also check the I:E ratio (the proportions of each breath cycle devoted to the inspiratory and expiratory phases ) and adjust the inspiratory time if necessary 5. The inspiratory time can be ad justed slightly to ensure greater patient comfort, however any change in inspiratory time will affect the I:E ratio . Rarely should an inspiratory time be less than 0.7 for an adult 6. Assure proper sedation level for patient to tolerate ventilator 7. Assure pati ent does not have auto -PEEP 8. Asthmatics and patients with severe bronchoconstriction require different initial settings: for example, PEEP of 0, FiO 2 100%, tidal volume 5 mL/kg, rate 10, I:E of 1:4 - 1:6 to allow exhalation and limit breath stacking /auto -PEEP . Hemodynamic instability may indicate increased intrathoracic pressure and require either manual chest wall compression to promote full exhalation or possibly needle chest decompression for pneumothorax NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Respiratory Distress (includes Bronchospasm, Pulmonary Edema) 200 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. It is important to understand the patient's underlying pulmonary status to choose the appropriate type of ventilation (volume or pressure) and mode (AC or SIMV most common) a. Volume control ventilation is generally preferred initially in adult s with compliant lungs (PPlat less than 30) because of better control of minute ventilation b. Pressure control ventilation can be used in patients with non -compliant lungs and elevated PPlat c. Assist Control (AC) mode is acceptable for most patients and provid es best control of minute ventilation . Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) is an alternative option Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Perform a pre -ventilator use inspection including a circuit check on the ventilator prior to placing it on a patient 2. Assess values during transport, including: a. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) Compare against baseline value to monitor for compliance changes or obstruction in the circuit b. Respirat ory rate .

March 2022 Tracheostomy Management 203 Version 3.0 Tracheostomy Management Aliases None Patient Care Goals 1. Meet airway management goals in a patient with a trach eostomy a. Assure patent airway, understand how to troubleshoot tracheostomy in a patient with respiratory distress b. Assure adequate oxygenation and ventilation Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Any adult or pediatric patient with an existing trach eostomy greater than 7 days post placement and a mature stoma tract Exclusion Criteria Adult or pediatric patient with tracheostomy less than 7 days post placement (i.e., no mature stoma tract ) Patient Management Assessment 1. Evaluate patient respiratory status as per Airway Management Guideline 2. In a patient with respiratory distress, evaluate for DOPE: a. Dislodgement or misplaced tracheostomy (e.g., decannulation) i. Assess for subcutaneous air in the neck which may indicate the tracheostomy is not in the trachea ii. Directly visualize the tracheostomy and the stoma (i.e., remove anything obstructing direct view of stoma including clothing/bandages/sponges e tc.) to assure it remains properly seated in the stoma b. Obstruction or secretions in tracheostomy i. Assure tracheostomy is patent . Especially in pediatric tracheostomy patients with significant respiratory distress, plugging or dislodgement /decannulation of the tracheostomy is the problem until proven otherwise ii. Auscultate breath sounds, consider potential for plugging of large airways in patients with significant respiratory distress c. Pneumothorax d. Equipment connection problems 3. As with any pati ent with respiratory distress, appropriate monitoring with pulse oximetry and waveform capnography should be provided as per Airway Management Guideline Treatment and Troubleshooting Interventions 1. In patient with mild respiratory distress and adequate oxygenation : a. Suctioning /clearing obstruction: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Tracheostomy Management 204 Version 3.0 i. If the patient is not on a ventilator, remove any cap, filter, or speaking valve that may be connected to the tracheostomy ii. Provide passive oxygenation with high flow oxygen over nose/mouth and stoma to avoid hypoxia during procedure iii. Remove inner cannula if present iv. If needed, use 1 -3 mL sterile saline directly into the tracheostomy to loosen secretions and help clear obstruction v. Pass appropriately sized suction catheter through tracheostomy vi. Once obstruction is cleared, assist ventilations as needed with BVM to tracheostomy tube, provide passive oxygenation or return patient to ventilator if patient on chronic ventilator via tracheostomy 2. In patient with significant /severe respiratory distress and/or inadequate oxygenation : a. If patient on ventilator, remove fro m vent and attempt BVM ventilation b. Suctioning /clearing obstruction : i. If the patient is not on a ventilator, remove any cap, filter, or speaking valve that may be connected to the tracheostomy ii. Provide passive oxygenation with high flow oxygen over nose/mouth and stoma to avoid hypoxia during procedure iii. Remove inner cannula if present iv. Attempt to pass appropriately sized suction catheter through tracheostomy v. If needed, u se 1-3 mL sterile saline directly into the tracheostomy to loosen secretions and help clear obstruction vi. If suction catheter will not pass, the tracheo stomy needs to be changed emergently due to obstruction. ( See below ) vii. Once obstruction is cleared, assist ventilations as needed with BVM to tracheostomy tube, provide passive oxygenation or return patient to ventilator if patient on chronic ventilator via trach eostomy tube c. Emergent tracheostomy change: determine size needed from imprint on existing tracheostomy flange/collar . If no replacement tracheostomy is available, an endotracheal tube of the same size or smaller may be used i. Ventilate or provide passive oxygenation during procedure. Attempt to ventilate from the upper airway or direct high flow O2 to stoma during attempts. ii. Deflate cuff (if present) iii. Remove ties and obstructed tracheostomy iv. Immediately replace with new (lubricated) tracheostomy , remove obturator, and begin BVM ventilation . Never use force. For difficult replacement, the following strategies can be attempted: a. Reposition patient with neck extended b. Ensure proper lubrication and re -attempt approach at a 90 -degree angle from long axis of neck (i.e., from the side) to enter the stoma and then rotate back along the long axis to complete insertion c. Attempt reinsertion with a smaller sized tracheostomy or endotracheal tube v. Confirm correct placement with waveform capnography, breath sounds, oxygen saturation, chest rise vi. Secure tracheostomy with tracheostomy ties or tube with appropriate holder 3. Consider use of humidified air or oxygen in any patient with a tracheostomy NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Tracheostomy Management 205 Version 3.0 4. Cuff may need to be inflated to provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation when positive pressure ventilation is required . However, cuff should never be inflated if positive pressure ventilation is not bei ng performed, or in patients with a Passy -Muir (teal colored) speaking valve in place Patient Safety Considerations 1. Especially in pediatric tracheostomy patients with significant respiratory distress, plugging or dislodgement of the tracheostomy is the problem until proven otherwise . Signs and symptoms of respiratory distress, cyanosis, ventilator alarms sounding, decreased level of consciousness, decreased Sp O2 or cardiac arrest in patients with a trach eostomy , as well as bradycardia in pediatric tracheostomy patients should be presumed due to a tracheostomy obstruction 2. Laryngectomy patients and some patients with congenital or surgi cal airway abnormalities cannot be orally intubated . Patients with tracheostomy alone ( e.g., for mechanical ventilation) and no airway abnormalities should be able to be orally intubated 3. For recent tracheostomy patients who present with bleeding from the tracheostomy in the early (up to 3 weeks) postoperative period, a tracheoinnominate arterial bleed is an uncommon and life -threatening complication (0.7% incidence and a 90% mortality rate) a. 50% of these patients present initially with a smaller sentinel ble ed/hemoptysis which appears to have stopped b. Inflation of the tracheostomy balloon to the maximum is a potential temporizing measure until definitive care can be provided, even overinflation may be needed . If the tracheostomy is uncuffed, it can be replaced with a cuffed endotracheal tube and the balloon maximally inflated c. Any patient in the early postoperative period (within a month of surgery) with hemoptysis or bleeding from a tracheostomy should be transported for evaluation, even if bleeding has stopped 4. Prompt tracheostomy replacement is important . Delays allow for narrowing of the stoma and can make recannulation more difficult Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Tracheostomy tube components a. Outer cannula: the tracheostomy size is stamped on the collar b. Inner cannula: not found in all trach eostomie s i. Not commonly used in pediatric patients ii. Removed by gently twisting a quarter turn to the left and pulling out c. Balloon cuff: protects lower airway from secretions /blood from above, allows for better mechanical ventilation d. Collar: includes imprint of tube size and attachment for umbilical tape /tracheostomy ties e. Obturator: stiffens and provides shape to tracheostomy tube to facilitate insertion . Must be removed for ventilation 2. To determine th e appropriate size suction catheter, double the size of the tracheostomy (number on collar of trach eostomy tube ) 3. A bougie may aid in the placement of an endotracheal tube into a mature stoma 4. An inner cannula may be required to ventilate through the tracheostomy tube NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Respiratory Rev. March 2022 Tracheostomy Management 206 Version 3.0 5. Uncuffed and fenestrated cuffed tracheostomy tubes may not protect the patient from aspiration 6. If transporting a patient with a tracheostomy either in an emergency or routine transpo rt, the patients home tracheostomy equipment ( e.g., \"Go bag\") should accompany them. The equipment that needs to be at the bedside to ensure safety includes appropriately sized French suction catheters, operating suction system, and spare tracheostomy tube s. Sterile saline, sterile gloves and water -soluble medical lubrication packets should also be available. Most tracheostomy patients will maintain a kit with these supplies to travel with 7. Inadvertent tracheostomy decannulation incidence is the second most frequent life - threatening pediatric tracheostomy complication, occurring at rates of 0.35 -15%, with the vast majority occurring more than 7 days postoperatively 8. Tracheostomy obstruction can occur for several reasons, including mucus plugging, abnormal /exce ss granulation tissue, tracheomalacia causing collapse of the tracheal wall around the tube 9. Do not replace a heat moisture exchange (HME) filter cap if soiled or wet as it can impede airflow Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Adequate oxygenation without respiratory distress suggests that the tracheostomy is patent and functioning correctly 2. Inadequate oxygenation and ventilation, respiratory distress, air hunger in a patient with a tracheostomy should first be presumed to be due to tracheostomy obstruction 3. Neck or chest crepitus on palpation suggests tracheostomy misplacement outside the trache a Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914001 - Airway 9914003 - Airway - Failed 9914005 - Airway - Obstruction/Foreign Body Key Documentation Elements For any tracheostomy patient with respiratory distress, visual verification of correct location of tracheostomy in the stoma and auscultation of breath sounds Continuous pulse oximetry and preferably continuous waveform capnography (or if unavailable, repeated capnometry measurements) should be documented for every patient .

If impending airway obstruction or altered mental status resulting in inability to maintain airway patency, immediately ensure patent airwa y. [See Airway Management Guideline and Spinal Care Guideline ] b. Consider airway adjuncts as appropriate avoiding nasal airway adju ncts in patents with oral or other facial injuries. [See Airway Management Guideline ] 3. Respiratory/Breathing a. If absent or diminished breath sounds in a hypotensive trauma patient, especially those with chest trauma and/or tracheal deviation, consider tension pn eumothorax and perform needle decompression of side without breath sounds or side opposite tracheal deviation; may need second or third needle decompression on same side if there is a rush of air but patient again has symptoms b. For open chest wound, place s emi-occlusive dressing c. Monitor oxygen saturation (SpO 2) and, if indicated, provide supplemental oxygen to maintain SPO 2 greater than 94% and respiratory support if needed . [See Respiratory Section ] 4. Circulation a. If pelvis is unstable, place pelvic binder or sheet to stabilize pelvis b. Establish IV access if needed (large bore preferred) c. Fluid resuscitation i. Adults 1.

NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Burns 218 Version 3.0 Burns Aliases None noted Patient Care Goals Minimize tissue damage and patient morbidity from burns Patient Presentation 1. Patient may present with: a. Airway - stridor, hoarse voice b. Mouth and nares - redness, blisters, soot, singed hairs c. Breathing - rapid, shallow, wheezes, rales d. Skin - Estimate Total Burn Surface Area (TBSA) and depth (partial vs. full thickness) e. Associated trauma - blast, fall, assault Inclusion Criteria Patients sustaining thermal burns Exclusion Criteria Electrical, chemical, and radiation burns [ See Toxins and Environmental Section ] Special Transport Considerations 1. Transport to most appropriate trauma center when t here is airway or respiratory involvement, or when significant trauma or blast injury is suspected 2. Consider air ambulance transportation for long transport times or airway management needs beyond the scope of the responding ground medic 3. Consider transport directly to burn center if partial or full thickness burns (TBSA) greater than 10% and/or involvement of hands/feet, genitalia, face, and/or circumferential burns Scene Management 1. Assure crew safety: a. Power off b. Electrical lines secure c. Gas off d. No secondary devices e. Hazmat determinations made f. Proper protective attire including breathing apparatus may be required Patient Management Assessment 1. Circumstances of event - Consider: a. Related trauma in addition to the burns b. Inhalation exposures such as carbo n monoxide (CO) and cyanide (CN) c. Pediatric or elder abuse NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Burns 219 Version 3.0 2. Follow ABC s (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) of resuscitation per the General Trauma Management Guideline 3. If evidence of possible airway burn, consider aggressive airway management 4. Consider spinal precautions for those that qualify per the Spinal Care Guideline 5. Estimate TBSA burned and depth of burn a. Use \"Rule of 9's\" [ See burn related tables in Appendix VI. Burn and Burn Fluid Charts ] b. First -degree/superficial burns (skin erythema only) are not included in TBSA calculations 6. Document pain scale Treatments and Interventions 1. Stop the burning a. Remove wet clothing (if not stuck to the patient) b. Remove jewelry c. Leave blisters intact 2. Minimize burn wound contamination a. Cover burns with dry dressing or clean sheet b. Do not apply gels or ointments 3. Monitor SPO 2, EtCO 2 and cardiac monitor 4. High flow supplemental oxygen for all burn patients rescued from an enclosed space 5. Establish IV access, avoid placement through burned skin 6. Evaluate respiratory status in patients with circumferential thoracic burns due to the risk for ventilatory compromise and potential need for esch arotomy 7. Evaluate distal circulation in circumferentially burned extremities due to increased risk of circulatory compromise and potential need for escharotomy 8. Consider early management of pain and nausea/vomiting 9. Initiate fluid resuscitation - Use lactated Ringer's or normal saline a. If patient in shock: i. Consider other cause, such as trauma or cyanide toxicity ii. Administer IV fluid per the Shock Guideline b. If patient not in shock: i. Begin fluids based on estimated TBSA [ See Appendix VI. Burn and Burn Fluid Charts as appropriate to patient weight] ii. Pediatric patients weighing less than 40 kg, use length -based tape for weight estimate and follow c. For persons over 40 kg, the initial fluid rate can als o be calculated using the \"Rule of 10\": i. Calculate the TBSA (round to nearest 10%) ii. Multiply TBSA x 10 = initial fluid rate ( mL/hr) {for persons between 40 -80 kg} iii. Add 100 mL/hr for every 10 kg of body weight over 80 kg 10. Prevent systemic heat loss and keep the patient warm Special Treatment Considerations 1. If blast mechanism, treat per the Blast Injury Guideline 2. Airway burns can rapidly lead to u pper airway obstruction and respiratory failure. After performing the appropriate airway management measures, the administration of nebulized epinephrine, bronchodilators, nebulized n -acetylcystine, and nebulized heparin, if available, can be considered t o reduce edema of the laryngeal and pulmonary tissues and airway occlusion from secretions and blood. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Burns 220 Version 3.0 3. Have a high index of suspicion for cyanide poisoning in a patient with depressed GCS, respiratory difficulty, and cardiovascular collapse in the setting of an enclosed -space fire. Give the antidote ( hydroxocobalamin), if available, in this circumstance 4. Particularly in enclosed -space fires, carbon monoxide toxicity is a consideration and pulse oximetry may not be accurate [ See Carbon Monoxide/Smoke Inhalation Guideline ] 5. For specific chemical exposures (cyanide, hydrofluoric acid, other acids, and alkali) [ See Topical Chem ical Burn Guideline ] 6. Consider decontamination and notification of receiving facility of potentially contaminated patient (e.g. , methamphetamine (meth) lab incident) 7. Burns that involve significant sloughing or loss of skin can result in uncontrolled heat loss. These patients should be monitored closely for the development of hypothermia and appropriate preventative measures should be taken Notes/Educational Pearls 1. Onset of stridor and change in voice are sentinel signs of potentially si gnificant airway burns, which may rapidly lead to airway obstruction or respiratory failure. 2. If the patient is in shock within one hour of burn, it is not from the burn. Evaluate the patient carefully for associated trauma or cyanide toxicity. 3. If the patie nt is not in shock, the fluid rates recommended above will adequately maintain patient's fluid volume. 4. Pain management is critical in acute burns. 5. End-tidal capnography ( EtCO 2) monitoring may be particularly useful to monitor respiratory status in patients receiving significant doses of narcotic pain medication. 6. Cardiac monitor is important in electrical burns and chemical inhalations. 7. TBSA is calculated only based on percent of second - and third -degree burns - First degree /superficial burns are not included in this calculation Quality Improvement Burn trauma is relatively uncommon. Clinician s should receive regular training on burn assessment and management.

Minimize systemic effects such as rhabdomyolysis, hyperkalemia, acute kidney injury Patient Presentation Inclusion criteria Traumatic crush mechanism of injury Non-traumatic injuries that may cause compartment syndrome include prolonged immobilization, prolonged compression of the torso/limbs, electrical injury, or burns Exclusion criteria None noted Patient Management Assessment 1. Identify any severe hemorrhage 2. Assess airway, breathing, and circulation 3. Evaluate for possible concomitant injury (e.g. , fractures, solid organ damage, or spinal injury) 4. Monitor for development of compartment syndrome (pain out of proportion to clinical exam, tense swelling, pain with passive stretch, muscle weakness, absent pulses, parasthesias) Treatment and Interventions 1. The treatment of crushed casualties should begin as soon as they are discovered 2. If severe hemorrhage is present, see Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management Guideline 3. Establish I V access . IV fluids should be administered prior to releasing the crushed body part. Administer 1000 mL normal saline ( NS) bolus . Avoid lactated Ringer's solution as it contains potassium . Crush injury without adequate fluid resuscitation develops into crush syndrome 4. For significant crush injuries or prolonged entrapment of an extremity, consider sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (maximum dose of 50 mEq) IV bolus over 5 minutes 5. Attach cardiac monitor. Obtain/interpret 12 -lead EKG, if available. Carefully moni tor for dysrhythmias or signs of hyp erkalemia before and immediately after release of pressure and during transport ( e.g., peaked T waves, wide QRS, lengthening QT interval, loss of P wave) 6. For pain control, consider analgesics [ See Pain Management Guideline ] 7. Consider the following post extrication a. Continued resuscitation with normal saline ( 500-1000 m L/hr for adults, m children ) b. If EKG suggestive of hyperkalemia or if findings of hyperkalemia, administer IV fluids and consider administration of: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Crush Injury/Crush Syndrome 223 Version 3.0 i. Calcium chloride - 1 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes, ensure IV patency and do not exceed 1 mL per minute (Pediatric: 10% 20 mg/kg, max 1 g , IV.IO over 5 minutes. OR ii. Calcium gluconate - 3 gm IV/IO over 5 minutes with constant cardiac monitoring (Pediatric: 10% 50 mg/kg (0.5 mL/kg), max 2 gram, IV over 5 minutes c. If not already administered, for significant crush injuries with EKG suggestive of hyperkalemia, administer sodium bicarbonate 1 mEq/kg (max dose of 50 mE q) IV bolus over 5 minutes d. If EKG suggestive of hyperkalemia, consider albuterol 5 mg via small volume nebulizer (can be repeated if no response is seen) Patient Safety Considerations Scene safety for both rescuers and patients are of paramount importance. Notes/Educational Pearls 1. Causes of mortality in untreated crush syndrome: a. Immediate i. Severe head injury ii. Traumatic asphyxia iii. Torso injury with damage to intrathoracic or intra -abdominal organs b. Early i. Sudden release of a crushed extremity may result in reperfusion syndrome (acute hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, and subsequent lethal arrhythmia) ii. Hyperkalemia (potassium is released from injured muscle cells) iii. Hypovolemi a/shock c. Late i. Acute kidney injury (from release of toxins from injured muscle cells) ii. Coagulopathy and hemorrhage iii. Sepsis Key Considerations 1. Rapid extrication and evacuation to a definitive care facility (trauma center preferred) 2. A patient with a crush inju ry may initially present with very few signs and symptoms . Maintain a high index of suspicion for any patient with a compressive mechanism of injury 3. A fatal medical complication of crush syndrome is hyperkalemia. Suspect hyperkalemia if T - waves become peaked, QRS becomes prolonged (greater than 0.12 seconds), absent P wave, prolonged QTc, or sine wave . Continue fluid resuscitation through extrication and transfer to hospital Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Mental status/ Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) 2. Evaluation for fractures and potential compartment syndrome development (neurovascular status of injured extremity) 3. Examination of spine 4.

March 2022 3.0 Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management Aliases None noted Patient Care Goals 1. Minimize blood loss from extremity hemorrhage 2. Avoid hemorrhagic shock due to extremity hemorrhage 3. Minimize pain and further injury due to fractures, dislocations, or soft -tissue injuries Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria [Refer to Crush Injury and Crus h Syndrome Guideline ] 1. Traumatic extremity hemorrhage (external hemorrhage) due to blunt or penetrating injury 2. Known or suspected extremity fractures or dislocations Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess degree of extremity/external bleeding/blood loss 2. Vascular status of extremity: a. Pallor b. Pulse c. Capillary refill and skin temperature 3. Evaluate for obvious deformity, shortening, rotation, or instability 4. Neurologic status of extremity: a. Sensation to light touch b. Distal movement of extremity Treatments and Interventions 1. Manage bleeding: a. Expose the wound and apply direct pressure to bleeding site, followed by a pressure dressing b. If direct pressure/pressure dressing is ineffective or impractical: i. If the bleeding site is amenable to tourniquet placement, apply a commercial tourniquet to extremity: 1. Tourniquet should be placed 2 -3 inches proximal to wound, not over a joint, and tightened until bleeding stops and distal pulse is eliminated 2. If bleeding continues, place a second tourniquet proximal to the first 3. For thigh wounds, consider placement of two tourniquets, side -by-side, and tighten sequentially c. Wound packing : i. Indications : Groin/axillary (\"junctional\") injury or any limb wound wi th persistent bleeding despite direct pressure and/or application of commercial tourniquet(s) NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management 226 Version 3.0 ii. Materials : hemostatic gauze, regular gauze , or any available material iii. Procedure : pack tightly and fully to the depth of the wound until bleeding stops (may requir e significant packing for deep, large wounds), then apply direct pressure and/or pressure dressing; do not remove packing to assess bleeding 1. Pack around (do not remove) bone fragments or foreign objects d. Junctional tourniquets may be considered for groin o r axillary wounds, if available e. Consider trane xamic acid ( TXA) for injury associated with hemorrhagic shock if within three hours of injury 2. Manage pain [ See Pain Management Guideline ] a. Pain management should be strongly considered for patients with tourniquets and suspected fractures b. Do not loosen tourniquet to relieve pain 3. Stabilize suspected fractures/dislocations: a. Strongly consider pain management before attempting to move a suspected fracture b. If distal vascular function is compromised, gently attempt to restore normal anatomic position, and reassess perfusion status c. Use splints as appropriate to limit movement of suspected fracture d. Elevate extremity fractures above heart level whenever possible to limit swelling e. Apply ice/cool packs to limit swelling in suspected fractures or soft tissue injury, but do not apply ice directly to bare skin f. Reassess distal neurovascul ar status after any manipulation or splinting of fractures/dislocations g. Dress open wounds associated with fractures with saline -moistened gauze 4. Remove wet or blood -soaked clothing and use measures to prevent heat loss 5. Remove jewelry and potentially constri cting clothing from the injured limb 6. Do not remove impaled foreign bodies Patient Safety Considerations 1. If improvised tourniquet has been placed by bystander, reassess, and consider placing commercial tourniquet proximal to it 2. If tourniquet is placed: a. Ensure that the tourniquet is sufficiently tight to occlude the distal pulse b. Ensure that the tourniquet is well marked and visible, and that all subsequent clinician s are aware of the presence of the tourniquet c. Do not cover the tourniquet with clothing or dr essings 3. Mark the time of tourniquet placement prominently on the patient and in the patient care report 4. Without removing the tourniquet or dressing, reassess frequently for signs of ongoing or renewed bleeding, such as: a. Blood soaking through dressing b. Bleeding distal to tourniquet Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Tourniquets should be applied to bare skin, 2 -3 inches proximal to the wound 2. Tourniquet should be reassessed at every stage of patient movement to ensure ongoing hem orrhage control. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Extremity Trauma/External Hemorrhage Management 227 Version 3.0 3. Survival is markedly improved when a tourniquet is placed before shock develops 4. Properly -applied tourniquets in conscious patients are painful - treat pain with analgesics, but do not loosen a tourniquet to relieve discomfort 5. Arterial pre ssure points may not be effective in controlling hemorrhage ; however, may help slow bleeding while tourniquet is applied 6. Amputated body parts should be transported with patient for possible re -implantation a. It should remain cool but dry b. Place the amputated part in a plastic bag c. Place the bag with the amputated part on ice in a second bag d. Do not let the amputated part come into direct contact with the ice 7. Pediatric considerations: a. External hemorrhage control to prevent shock is critical in infants and young children, due to their relatively small blood volume b. Most commercial tourniquets can be used effectively on children over 2 years of age c. Stretch -wrap -tuck elastic -type tourniquets can be used on any age patient d. Direct pressure and wound packing may be mor e suitable for infants and young children e. Consult with local online medical direction regarding use of traction splints for femur fractures in young children, to avoid risk of possible nerve damage Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914083 - Injury - Bleeding/Hemorrhage Control 9914097 - Injury - Extremity Key Documentation Elements Vital signs and vascular status of extremity after placement of tourniquet, pressure dressing, packing , and/or splint Time of tourniquet placement Documentation of signs/symptoms of possible compartment syndrome Performance Measures Proper placement of tourniquet (location, cessation of bleeding) Proper marking and timing of tourniquet placement and noti fication of tourniquet placement to subsequent EMS clinicians and ED personnel Appropriate splinting and padding of fractures National EMS Quality Alliance (NEMSQA) Performance Measures (for additional information, see www.nemsqa.org ) o Pediatrics \u201403: Documentation of Estimated Weight in Kilograms o Trauma \u201401: Pain Assessment of Injured Patients NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev.

Airway: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Head I njury 234 Version 3.0 a. Administer high -flow oxygen via NRB (non -rebreather) as a precaution against unanticipated deterioration b. If patient unable to maintain airway, consider oral airway (nasal airway should not be used with significant facial injury or possible basilar skull fracture) c. BVM (bag -valve -mask) flow oxygen (HFO) /non-rebreather ( NRB ) inadequate to maintain good airway d. Place supraglottic airway or perform endotracheal intub ation or if BVM ventilation ineffective in maintaining oxygenation or if airway is continually compromised. Endotracheal intubation (ETI)/supraglottic airway (SGA ) should only be used in systems that have continuous EtCO 2 monitoring 2. Breathing: a. For patients who cannot maintain adequate oxygenation with HFO/NRB, BVM ventilation (15 years old or older: 10 breaths per minute ; 2-14 years old : 20 breaths per minute ; less than 2 years old : 25 breaths per minute ) with gentle manual bagging . Consider flow - controlled bags and ventilation rate timers to help prevent hyper -/overventilation b. SGA placement or ETI should only be performed if BVM ventilation fails to maintain adequate oxygenation . With advanced airways, manage with a target EtCO 2 of 40 (normal range 35 -45 mmHg) c. Do not induce hypocapnia through hyper -/overventilation 3. Circulation: a. Wound care i. Contr ol bleeding with direct pressure if no suspected open skull injury ii. Moist sterile dressing to any potential open skull wound iii. Cover an injured eye with moist saline dressing and place cup over it b. Moderate/severe closed head injury i. Blood pressure: avoid hypot ension 1. Adult (age greater than 10 y ears ): maintain SBP greater than or equal to 110 mmHg 2. Pediatric : maintain SBP: a. Age less than 1 month: greater than 60 mmHg b. Age 1-12 months: greater than 70 mmHg c. Age 1-10 years : greater than 70 + 2x age in years c. Closed head injury i. Administer normal saline ( NS)/lactated R inger 's (LR) fluid boluses to maintain SBP above threshold . Do not wait until after the patient is already hypotensive \u2014prevent hypotension d. Do not delay transport to initiate IV access 4. Disability: a. Evaluate for other causes of altered mental status \u2014 check blood glucose during transport b. Spinal assessment and management, per Spinal Care Guideline c. Perform and trend neurologic status assessment (GCS or AVPU scale) i. Early signs of deterioration: 1. Confusion 2. Agitation 3. Drowsiness 4. Vomiting 5. Severe headache NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Head Injury 235 Version 3.0 d. Severe head injury - Elevate head of bed 30 degrees 5. Transport destination specific to head trauma a. Preferential transport to highest level of care within trauma system: i. GCS 3 -13, P (pain) or U (unresponsive) on AVPU scale ii. Penetrating head trauma iii. Open or depressed skull fracture Patient Safety Considerations 1. Do not hyperventilate patients: Maintain all patients in EtCO 2 range of 35 -45 mmHg 2. Assume concomitant cervical spine injury in patients with moderate/severe head injury 3. Geriatric Consideration: Elderly patients with ankylosing spondylitis or severe kyphosi s should be padded and immobilized in a position of comfort and may not tolerate a cervical collar 4. Pediatric Consideration: Children have disproportionately larger heads. When securing pediatric patients to a spine board, the board should have a recess for the head, or the body should be elevated approximately 1 -2 cm to accommodate the larger head size and avoid neck flexion when immobilized Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Head injury severity guideline: a. Mild : GCS 14 -15/AVPU = (A) b. Moderate : GCS 9 -13/AVPU = (V) c. Severe : GCS 3 -8/AVPU = (P) or (U) 2. Important that clinician s be specifically trained in accurate neurologic status assessment [See Appendix VII. Neurologic Status Assessment ] 3. If endotracheal intubation or invasive airways are used, continuous waveform capnography is required to document proper tube placement and assure proper ventilation rate and minute volume (preventing both hyperventilation [too fast] and overventilation [too m uch]) 4. to diagnose in the prehospital setting .

Accomplish mission with minimal additional injuries Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria High threat environment - when greater than normal conditions exist that could cause threat to clinician or patient Exclusion Criteria No significant threat exists to clinician or patient allowi ng for the performance of routine care Patient Management Assessment, Treatment, and Interventions 1. Hot Zone/Direct Threat care considerations: a. Mitigate threat as able to minimize risk to patients and clinician s, move to a safer position and recognize that threats are dynamic and may be ongoing, requiring continuous assessment of threat b. Defer in depth medical interventions if engaged in ongoing direct threat (e.g. , active shooter, unstable building collapse, improvised explosive device, hazardous material threat) c. Triage should be deferred to when no longer in a hot zone/direct threat care zone d. Prioritization for extraction is based on resources available and the situation encountered e. Encourage patients to provide self -first aid or instruct uninjured bystande rs to provide aid f. Consider hemorrhage control: i. Tourniquet application is the primary \"medical\" intervention to be considered in Hot Zone/Direct Threat Zone . Tourniquet choice should be guided by expected ability to perform in the desired patient population (pediatrics) ii. Consider instructing patient to apply direct pressure to the wound if no tourniquet available (or application is not feasible) iii. Consider quickly placing or directing patient to be placed in position to protect airway, if not immediat ely moving patient NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 High Threat Considerations/Active Shooter Scenario 239 Version 3.0 2. Warm Zone/Indirect Threat care considerations: a. Maintain situational awareness b. Ensure safety of both responders and patients by rendering equipment and environment safe (firearms, vehicle ignition) c. Conduct primary survey, per the General Trauma Management Guideline , and initiate appropriate life -saving interventions i. Hemorrhage control 1. Tourniquet 2. Wound packing if feasible ii. Maintain airway and support ventilation [ See Airway Management Guideline ] d. Maintain body temperature and prevent hypothermia e. Do not delay patient extraction and evacuation for non -life-saving interventions f. Consider establishing a casualty collection point if multiple patients are encou ntered g. Unless in a fixed casualty collection point, triage in this phase of care should be limited to the following categories: i. Uninjured and/or capable of self -extraction ii. Deceased/expectant iii. All others Patient Safety Considerations 1. Anticipate unique threats based on situation 2. During high threat situations, clinician safety should be considered in balancing the risks and benefits of patient treatment Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. In high threat situations clinician and patient safety will need to be simultaneously considered 2. During high threat situations, an integrated response with other public safety entities may be warranted 3. Risks taken and threats to responder safety must be weighed in relations to the expected benefit to patient safety and outcome 4.

Select patients for whom spinal motion restriction (SMR) is indicated 2. Minimize secondary injury to spine in patients who have, or may have, an unstable spinal injury 3. Minimize patient morbidity from the unnecessary use of immobilization devices Patient Presentation Inclusion criteria Traumatic mechanism of injury Exclusion criteria None noted Patient Management Assessment 1. Assess the scene to determine the mechanism of injury a. Mechanism alone should not determine if a patient requires spinal motion restriction - however, mechanisms that have been associated with a higher risk of injury are: i. Motor vehicle crashes (including automobiles, all -terrain vehicles, and snowmobiles) ii. Axia l loading injuries to the spine iii. Falls greater than 10 feet 2. Assess the patient in the position found for findings associated with spine injury: a. Mental status b. Neurologic deficits c. Spinal pain or tenderness d. Any evidence of intoxication e. Other severe injuries, particularly associated torso injuries Treatment and Interventions 1. Place patient in cervical collar and initiate spinal motion restriction in adults if there are any of the following: a. Patient complains of midline neck or spine pain b. Any midline n eck or spinal tenderness with palpation c. Any abnormal mental status (including extreme agitation) d. Focal or neurologic deficit e. Any evidence of alcohol or drug intoxication f. Another severe or painful distracting injury g. Torticollis in children NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Spinal Care 242 Version 3.0 h. A communication barrier that prevents accurate assessment i. If none of the above apply , patient may be managed without a cervical collar 2. Patients with penetrating injury to the neck should not be placed in a cervical collar or other spinal precautions regardless of whether they are exhibiting neurologic symptoms or not. Doing so can lead to delayed identification of injury or airway compromise and has been associated with increased mortality 3. If extrication is required: a. From a vehicle : After placing a cervical collar, if indicated, children in a booster seat and adults should be allowed to self -extricate. For infants and toddlers already strapped in a car seat with a built -in harness, extricate the child while strapped in his/her car seat b. Other situations requiring extrica tion: A, preferably padded, long board may be used for extrication, using the lift and slide (rather than a logroll) technique 4. Helmet removal a. If a football helmet needs to be removed, it is recommended to remove the face mask followed by manual removal (r ather than the use of automated devices) of the helmet while keeping the neck manually immobilized \u2014 occipital and shoulder padding should be applied, as needed, with the patient in a supine position to maintain neutral cervical spine positioning b. Evidence is lacking to provide guidance about other types of helmet removal 5. Do not transport patients on rigid long boards unless the clinical situation warrants long board use. An example of this may be facilit ation of immobilization of multiple extremity injuries or an unstable patient where removal of a board will delay transport and/or other treatment priorities. In these situations, long boards should ideally be padded or have a vacuum mattress applied to mi nimize secondary injury to the patient 6. Patients should be transported to the nearest appropriate facility, in accordance with the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma ( ACS COT ) 2022 National Guideline for the Fie ld Triage of Injured Patients 7. Patients with severe kyphosis or ankylosing spondylitis may not tolerate a cervical collar. These patients should be immobilized in a position of comfort using towel rolls or sandbags Patient Safety Considerations 1. Be aware of potential airway compromise or aspiration in immobilized patient with nausea/vomiting or with facial/oral bleeding 2. Excessively tight immobilization straps can limit chest excursion and cause hypoventilation 3. Prolonged immobilizati on on spine board can lead to ischemic pressure injuries to skin 4. Prolonged immobilization on spine board can be very uncomfortable for patient 5. Children are abdominal breathers therefore immobilization straps should go across chest and pelvis and not across the abdomen 6. Children have disproportionately larger heads. When securing pediatric patients to a spine board, the board should have a recess for the head or the body should be elevated approximately 1 -2 cm to accommodate the larger head size and avoid ne ck flexion when immobilized 7. In an uncooperative patient, avoid interventions that may promote increased spinal movement 8. The preferred position for all patients with spine management is flat and supine. There are three circumstances under which raising the head of the bed to 30 degrees may be considered: NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Trauma Rev. March 2022 Spinal Care 243 Version 3.0 a. Respiratory distress b. Suspected severe head trauma c. Promotion of patient compliance Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Evidence is lacking to support or to refute the use of manual stabilization prior to spinal assessment in the setting of a possible traumatic injury when the patient is alert with spontaneous head/neck movement. Clinician s should not manually stabilize these alerts and spontaneously moving pa tients since patients with pain will self -limit movement and forcing immobilization in this scenario may unnecessarily increase discomfort and anxiety 2. Certain populations with musculoskeletal instability may be predisposed to cervical spine injury. However , evidence does not support or refute that these patients should be treated differently than those who do not have these conditions. These patients should be treated according to the Spinal Care Guideline like other patients without these conditions 3. Pediatric considerations: a. Age alone should not be a factor in decision -making for prehospital spine care, yet the patient's ability to reliably be assessed at the extremes of age should be considered. Communic ation barriers with infants/toddlers or elderly patients with dementia may prevent the clinician from accurately assessing the patient b. There is no evidence that children experience non -contiguous multilevel injuries. The existing evidence suggests that the rate of contiguous multilevel injuries is exceedingly low at 1% c. Because of variation in head size to body ratio, consider additional padding under the shoulders to avoid excessive cervical spine flexion 4. Spinal precautions should be considered a tre atment or preventive therapy 5. Patients who are likely to benefit from immobilization should undergo this treatment 6. Patients who are not likely to benefit from immobilization, who have a low likelihood of spinal injury, should not be immobilized 7. Ambulatory patients may be safely immobilized on gurney with cervical collar and straps and will not generally require a spine board . The role for standing take downs is extremely limited, e.g., extrication of a patient with a high likelihood of a spinal c ord injury from a large body of water. Ambulatory patients may have a collar applied and walked to the EMS gurney 8. Reserve long spine board use for the movement of patients whose injuries limit ambulation and who meet criteria for the use of spinal precauti ons. Remove from the long board as soon as is practical Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Mental status 2. Normal neurologic examination 3. Evidence of intoxication 4.

March 2022 Trauma Mass Casualty Incident 249 Version 3.0 Trauma Mass Casualty Incident Aliases Disaster Mass casualty incident (MCI) Trauma triage for multiple casualties overwhelming EMS resources Patient Care Goals 1. Save life and limb for greatest number given resources available 2. Triage and transport most critical requiring immediate in -hospital care first Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria Trauma MCI overwhelming immediately available resources Exclusion Cr iteria Routine EMS response for non -MCI for trauma Patient Management Special circumstances may occur in any incident in which the resources of the emergency medical services are overwhelmed by the number and severity of casualties. Triage and Treat 1. Ensure scene safety for EMS clinicians 2. Senior EMS clinician rapidly assess es scene and assigns roles and responsibilities to EMS personnel 3. Sort patients using a locally agreed upon MCI triage process such as SALT (Sort, Assess, Lifesaving Interventions, Treatment/Transport) , START/JUMP -START (Simple Triage and Rapid Transport) , MUCC (Model Uniform Core Criteria) , etc. 4. Identify those in need of immediate life -saving intervention 5. Triage categories are recommended and should be guided by local protocols: immediate, delayed, minimal, expectant, dead 6. Triage new patients a s identified 7. Re-triage frequently for duration of MCI 8. Immediate life -saving interventions for immediate patients a. Treat hemorrhage with tourniquets, direct pressure with assistance from other patients or other devices b. Ensure patent airway by opening airway and using rapid adjuncts c. Decompress tension pneumothorax d. Use autoinjector antidotes if needed Transport 1. First transport immediate patients a.

March 2022 Trauma Mass Casualty Incident 250 Version 3.0 b. Those with injuries temporized that required immediate transport (received airway intervention, decompressed tension pneumothorax, effective tourniquets for extremity hemorrhage or amputations) 2. Second, transport delayed patients a. Continue to re -triage continuously b. Continue life -saving interventions c. Initiate urgent required therapy 3. Assess minimal patients for appropriate transport decision Patient Safety Considerations 1. Ensure patients remain in safe area 2. Re-assess scene safety as incident progresses as needed Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. The most experienced EMS clinician should perform triage. 2. Another experienced EMS clinician should be assigned to immediate patient area and perform life-saving interventions as well as continuous triage . 3. Prioritize patients within immediate group for transport. 4. If available, another EMS clinician should be assigned to delayed area and perform urgent interventions if patient condition changes . Continu ously triage and prioritize within the delayed patient group for transport. 5. Patient triage category may change with subsequent triage . If need for up -triage occurs, perform life -saving interventions, and move patient to appropriate triage area (delayed or immediate). 6. EMS system leaders within a defined area should work collaboratively to agree upon a common triage tool. 7. Evidence is limited on the highest performing triage tool. Available evidence suggests that the SALT triage tool was most likely to correc tly triage adult emergency department patients, but all tested triage tools demonstrated relatively high rates of under triage .

Clinical improvement should be based upon the drying of secretions and easing of respiratory effort rather than heart rate or pupillary response 10. Continu ous and ongoing patient reassessment is critical Assess ment 1. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents are highly toxic chemical agents and can rapidly be fatal 2. Patients with low -dose chronic exposures may have a more delayed presentation of symptoms 3. Antidotes (atropine and pralidoxime) are effective if administered before circulation fails 4. The patient may develop: a. Miosis (pinpoint pupils) b. Bronchospasm c. Bradycardia d. Vomiting e. Excessive secretions in the form of : i. Tearing ii. Salivation iii. Rhinorrhea iv. Diarrhea v. Urination vi. Bronchorrhea 5. Penetration of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent into the central nervous system (CNS) will cause: a. Headache b. Confusion c. Generalized muscle weaknes s d.

There is usually an asymptomatic interval of minutes after liquid exposure before these symptoms occur b. Effects from vapor exposure occur almost immediately 8. Signs and symptoms with large acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposures (regardless of route) a. Sudden loss of consciousness b. Seizures c. Copious secretions d. Apnea e. Death 9. Obtain an accurate exposure history (as patient may become unconscious before arrival at the ED: a. Time of ingestion or exposure b. Route of exposure c. Quantity of medication or toxin taken (safely collect all possible medications or agents) d. Alcohol or other intoxicant taken e. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease 10. The patient can manifest any of the signs and symptoms of the toxidrome based on the route of exposure, agent involved, and concentration of the agent : a. Vapor exposures will have a direct effect on the eyes and pupils causing miosi s b. Patients with isolated skin exposures will have normally reactive pupil s c. Certain acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents can place the patient at risk for both a vapor and skin exposur e Treatment and Interventions (See dosing tables ) 1. Medications : a. Atropine i. Atropine is the primary antidote for organophosphate, carbamate, or nerve agent exposures, and repeated doses should be administered liberally to patients who exhibit signs and symptoms of exposure or toxici ty ii. Atropine may be provided in multi -dose chloride is a secondary treatment and should be given concurrently to reactivate acetylcholinesterase ii. Pralidoxime chloride may be provided in a single dose vial, pre -filled syringes, or auto -injector s iii. Auto -injectors typically contain 600 mg of pralidoxime chlorid e iv. To be beneficial to the victim, a dose of pralidoxime chloride should be administered shortly after the nerve agent or or ganophosphate poisoning as it has minimal clinical effect if administration is delaye d c. Benzodiazepines i. Benzodiazepines are administered as an anticonvulsant for those patients who exhibit seizure activity [ See Seizures Guideline for doses and routes of administration] ii. Lorazepam, diazepam, and midazolam are the most frequently used benzodiazepines in the prehospital setting; midazolam may have the fastest NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

Benzodiazepines may be provided in multi -dose or single -dose vials, pre -filled syringes, iv. CANA Antidote Nerve Agent) is a commercially available auto\u00ad injector that contains 10 mg of diazepam d. Duodote \u00ae i. A commercially available auto -injector of nerve agent/organophosphate antidote ii. Duodote \u00ae is one auto -injector that contains 2.1 mg of atropine and 600 mg of pralidoxime chloride e. ATNAA \u00ae (Antidote Treatment Nerve Agent Auto -injector) i. An auto -injector of nerve agent/organophosphate antidote that is typically in military supplies ii. ATNAA \u00ae is one auto -injector that contains 2.1 mg of atropine and 600 mg of pralidoxime chloride iii. ATNAA \u00ae may be seen in civilian supplies assets when Duodote \u00ae is unavailable or in short su pply f. CHEMPACK i. Federal cache of nerve agent antidotes that is managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and offered to states that voluntarily agree to maintain custody and security of CHEMPACK assets ii. These are forward -deployed at sites determined by states that are part of the program such as hospitals and EMS centers iii. Deployment of CHEMPACKs is reserved for events where the nerve agent/organophosphate exposure will deplete the local or regional supply of antidot es iv. There are two types of CHEMPACK containers: 1. EMS Contai ners : CHEMPACK assets for EMS contain a large portion of auto - injectors for rapid administration of antidotes by EMS clinician s of all levels of licensure/certification . They contain enough antidote to treat roughly 454 patients 2. Hospital Containers : CHEMPACK ass ets contain a large portion of multidose vials and powders for reconstitution \u2014 they contain enough antidote to treat roughly 1 ,000 patients 2. Medication Administration : a. Atropine, in large and potentially multiple doses, is the antidote for an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning b. Atropine should be administered immediately followed by repeated doses until the patient ' s secretions resolve c. Pralidoxime chloride (2 -PAM) is a secondary treatment and, when possible, should be administered concurrently with atropin e d. The stock of atropine and pralidoxime chloride available to EMS clinician s is usually not sufficient to fully treat the victim of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposure ; however, EMS clinician s should initi ate the administration of atropine and, if available, pralidoxime chloride e. Seizures should be treated with benzodiazepines. There is some emerging evidence that, for midazolam, the intranasal route of administration may be NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors (Carbamates, Nerve Agents, Organophosphates) Exposure 264 Version 3.0 preferable to the intramuscular r oute. However, intramuscular absorption may be more clinically efficacious than the intranasal route in the presence of significant rhinorrhea f. The patient should be emergently transported to the closest appropriate medical facility as directed by medical d irection 3. Recommended Doses (See dosing tables ) The medication dosing tables that are provided below are based upon the severity of the clinical signs and symptoms exhibited by the patient. There are several imperative factors to note : a. For organophosphate or severe acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent exposure, the required dose of atropine necessary to dry secretions and improve the respiratory status may exceed 20 mg. Atropine should be administered rapidly and repeatedly until the pat ient's clinical symptoms diminish. Atropine must be given until the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent has been metabolized. b. Because Duodote \u00ae auto -injectors contain pralidoxime chloride, they should not be used for additional dosing of atropine beyond t he recommended administered dose of pralidoxime chloride c. All the medications below can be administered intravenously in the same doses cited for the intramuscular route . However, due to the rapidity of onset of signs, symptoms, and potential death from acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agents , intramuscular administra tion is highly recommended to eliminate the inherent delay associated with establishing intravenous access d. The antidotes can be administered via the intraosseous route. However, due to the rapidity of onset of signs, symptoms, and potential death from acet ylcholinesterase inhibitor agents, intramuscular administration remains the preferable due to the inherent delay associated with establishing intraosseous access and the limited use of this route of administration for other medications NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

Although Duodote \u00ae and ATNAA \u00ae contains atropine, the primary antidote for an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning, the inclusion of pralidoxime chloride in the auto -injector can present challenges if additional doses of atropine are warranted by the patient condition and othe r formulations of atropine are unavailable : i. Pediatrics : an overdose of pralidoxime chloride may cause profound neuromuscular weakness and subsequent respiratory depression ii. Adults : Especially for the geriatric victim, excessive doses of pralidoxime chloride may cause severe systolic and diastolic hypertension, neuromuscular weakness, headache, tachycardia, and visual impairment iii. Geriatrics : victim who may have underlying medical conditions, particularly impaired kidney function or hyperten sion, the EMS clinician should consider administering the lower recommended adult dose of intravenous pralidoxime chloride 5. Considerations during the use of auto -injectors a. If an auto -injector is administered, a dose calculation prior to administration is not necessary b. For atropine, additional auto -injectors should be administered until secretions diminish. c. Mark 1 kits, Duodote \u00ae and ATNAA \u00ae have not been approved for pediatric use by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but they can be considered for the initial treatment for children of any age with severe symptoms of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor agent poisoning especially if other f ormulations of atropine are unavailable d. Pediatric Atro -Pen\u00ae auto -injectors are commercially available in a 0.25 mg auto - injector ( yellow ) and a 0.5 mg auto -injector ( red). Atro -Pen\u00ae auto -injectors are commercially available in a 1 mg auto -injector ( blue ) and a 2 mg auto -injector ( green ) e. A pralidoxime chloride 600 mg auto -injector may be administered to an infant that weighs greater than 12 kg Notes/Educational Pearls Key Consideration s 1. Clinical effects of acetylcholinesterase inhibito r agents a. The clinical effects are caused by the inhibition of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase which allows excess acetylcholine to accumulate in the nervous system b. The excess accumulated acetylcholine causes hyperactivity in muscles, glands, and nerves 2. Organophosphates Insecticides a. Can be legally purchased by the general publi c b. Organophosphate pesticides penetrate tissues and bind to the patient's body fat producing a prolonged period of illness and ongoing toxicity even during aggressive treatmen t 3. Nerve agents a. Traditionally classified as weapons of mass destruction (WMD ) b. Not readily accessible to the general publi c c. Extremely toxic and rapidly fatal with any route of exposur e d.

Irradiated patients pose no threat to medical clinician s 2. Contaminated patients pose very little threat to medical clinician s who use appropriate PPE including N95 masks or respirators, gloves, gowns, and face and eye protection 3. Sources of radiation a. Legal i. Industrial plants ii. Healthcare facilities that provide radio logic services iii. Nuclear power plants iv. Mobile engineering sources (i.e., construction sites that are installing cement) b. Illegal i. Weapons of mass destruction ii. \"Dirty bomb \" design to contaminate widespread areas 4. Physiology of radiation poisoning c. Contamination : Poisoning from direct exposure to a radioactive source, contaminated debris, liquids, or clothing where radiation continues to be emitted from particles on surface d. Exposure : Poisoning from radioactivity, in the form of ionizing rays, penetrating through t he bodily tissues of the patien t 5. Common types of radioactivity that cause poisonin g e. Gamma rays i. Highest frequency of ionizing rays ii. Penetrates the skin deepl y iii. Causes the most severe radiation toxicity f. Beta rays : can penetrate up to 1 cm of the skin's thicknes s g. Alpha ray s i. Lowest frequency of ionizing rays ii. Short range of absorptio n iii. Dangerous only if ingested or inhaled h. Radioactive daughters i. Products of decay of the original radioactive substan ce ii. Can produce gamma and beta rays ( i.e., uranium decays into a series of radon daughters ) 6. In general, trauma patients who have been exposed to or contaminated by radiation should be triaged and treated based on the severity of their conventional injurie s 7. A patient who i s contaminated with radioactive material ( i.e., flecks of radioactive material embedded in their clothing and skin) generally poses a minimal exposure risk to medical personnel, although should not be placed in a contained space before decontaminatio n 8.

March 2022 Topical Chemical Burn 275 Version 3.0 Topical Chemical Burn Aliases Chemical Burn Patient Care Goal s 1. Rapid recognition of a topical chemical burn 2. Initiation of emergent and appropriate intervention and patient transport Patient Presentatio n Inclusion Criteri a 1. Patients of all ages who have sustained exposure to a chemical that can cause a topical chemical burn may develop immediate or in some cases a delayed clinical presentation 2. Agents that are known to cause chemical burns include alkalis, acids, mustard agent, and lewisite Exclusion criteri a None noted Patient Managemen t 1. Don the appropriate PPE 2. Remove the patient's clothing, if necessary 3. Contaminated clothing should preferably be placed in double bags 4. If deemed necessary and manpower resources permit, the patient should be transported by EMS clinician s who did not participate in the decontamination process, and in an emergency response vehicle that has not been exposed to the chemical 5. Information regarding the chemical should be gathered while on scene including materials safety data sheet if available 6. Communicate all data regarding the chemical to the receiving facility Assessment 1. Clinical effects and severity of a topical chemical burn is dependent upon: a. Class of agent (alkali injury or acid injury ) b. Concentration of the chemical the (higher the concentration, the greater the risk of injury ) c. pH of the chemica l i. Alkali -increased risk with pH greater than or equal to 11 ii. Acid -increased risk with pH less than or equal to 3 d. Onset of bur n i. Immediate ii. Delayed ( e.g., hydrofluoric acid ) 2. Calculate the estimated total body surface area that is involved 3. Prevent further contamination 4. Special attention to assessment of ocular or oropharyngeal exposure \u2014 evaluate for airway compromise secondary to spasm or direct injury associated with oropharyngeal NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Topical Chemical Burn 276 Version 3.0 burns 5. Some acid and alkali agents may manifest systemic effects Treatment and Interventi ons 1. If dry chemical contamination, carefully brush off solid chemical prior to flushing the site as the irrigating solution may activate a chemical reaction 2. If wet chemical contamination, flush the patient's skin (and eyes, if involved) with copious amounts of water or normal saline 3. Provide ad equate analgesia per the Pain Management Guideline 4. Consider the use of topical anesthetic eye drops ( e.g., tetracaine) for chemical burns of the eye 5. For eye exposure, administer continuous flushing of irrigation fluid to eye \u2014 Morgan lens may facilitate administration 6. Early airway intervention for airway compromise or bronchospasm associated with oropharyngeal burns 7. Take measures to minimize hypothermia 8. Initiate intravenous fluid resuscitation if necessary to obtain hemodynamic stability Hydrofluoric Acid Hydrofluoric acid (HF) is a highly corrosive substance that is primarily used for automotive cleaning products, rust removal, porcelain cleaners, etching glass, cleaning cement or brick, or as a pickling agent to remove impurities from various forms of steel. Hydrofluoric acid readily penetrates intact skin and there may be underlying tissue injur y. It is unlikely that low concentration HF will cause an immediate acid -like burn however there may be delayed onset of pain to the exposed area . Higher concentration HF may cause immediate pain as well as more of a burn appearance that can range from mild erythema to an obvious burn . An oral or large dermal exposure can result in significant systemic hypocalcemia with possible QT prolongation and c ardiovascular collapse 1. For all patients in whom a hydrofluoric acid exposure is confirmed or suspected : a. Vigorou sly irrigate all affected areas with water or normal saline for a minimum of 15 minutes b. Apply a cardiac monitor for oral or large dermal exposures significant HF exposures c. Apply calcium preparation: i. Calcium prevents tissue damage from hydrofluoric acid ii. Topical calcium preparations: 1. Commercially manufactured calcium gluconate gel 2. If commercially manufactured calcium gluconate gel is not available, a topical calcium gluconate gel preparation can be made by combining 150 mL (5 ounces) of a sterile water -soluble gel (e.g., Surgilube\u00ae or KY \u00ae jelly) with one of the following: a. 35 mL of calc ium gluconate 10% solution b. 10 g of calcium gluconate tablets (e.g., Tums \u00ae) c. 3.5 g calcium gluconate powder or 3. If calcium gluconate is not available, 10 mL of calcium chloride 10% solution in 150 mL in sterile water -soluble gel (e.g., Surgilube\u00ae or KY \u00ae jelly) 4. Apply generous amounts of the calcium gluconate gel to the exposed skin sites to neutralize the pain of the hydrofluoric acid NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Topical Chemical Burn 277 Version 3.0 a. Leave in place for at least 20 minutes then reassess b. This can be repeated as needed 5. Hydrofluoric acid exposure is very painful. Calcium gel is the foundation of pain control. While intravenous pain medications may be less effective, they should be added to calcium gel to assist with pain control . Hydrofluoric acid exposure typically causes pain out of proportion to the vis ible dermal effects. Minimal skin changes may exist with substantial exposures 6. If fingers are involved, apply the calcium gel to the hand, squirt additional calcium gel into a surgical glove, and then insert the affected hand into the glove 7. For patients wh o have ingested hydrofluoric acid or who have a large dermal exposure consider intravenous calcium gluconate, 1 -2 grams of 10% solution, as symptomatic hypocalcemia can precipitate rapidly as manifest by muscle spasms, seizures, hypotension ventricular arr hythmias , and QT prolongation Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Don PPE 2. Take measures to prevent the patient from further contamination through decontamination 3. Take measures to protect the EMS clinician and others from contamination 4. Do not attempt to neutrali ze an acid with an alkali or an alkali with an acid as an exothermic reaction will occur and cause serious thermal injury to the patient 5. Expeditious transport or transfer to a designated burn center should be considered for burns that involve a significant percentage of total body surface area or burns that involve the eyes, face, hands, feet , or genitals Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. IV fluid resuscitation should be guided by patient age, percentage of body surface area involved in burn, body habitus and calculated by the Parkland Formula [ See Appendix VI. Burn and Burn Fluid Charts ] 2. Since the severity of topical chemical burns is largely dependent upon the type, concentration, and pH of the chemical involved as well as the body site and surface area involved, it is imperative to obtain as much information as possible while on scene about the chemical substance by which the patient was exposed. The information gathering process will often include: a. Tran sport of the sealed container of the chemical to the receiving facilit y b. Transport of the original or a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) of the substance to the receiving facility c. Contacting the reference agency to identify the chemical agent and assist in management ( e.g., CHEMTREC \u00ae) 3. Inhalation of HF should be considered in any dermal exposure involving the face and neck or if clothing is soaked in the product 4. Decontamination is critical for both acid and alkali agents to reduce injury \u2014 removal of chemicals with a low pH (acids) is more easily accomplished than chemicals with a high pH (alkalis) because alkalis tend to penetrate and bind to deeper tissues 5. Some ch emicals will also manifest local and systemic signs, symptoms, and bodily damage NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Topical Chemical Burn 278 Version 3.0 Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. An estimate of the total body surface area that is involved 2. Patient response to therapeutic interventions 3.

Disability/neuro/mental status e. Treat any compromise of these parameter s f. Ask about chest pain and difficulty breathi ng 2. Vital signs including temperature for hyperthermia 3. Apply a cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmia s 4. Check blood glucose level 5. Monitor EtCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 6. Check a 12 -lead EKG when possible 7. Check for trauma, self -inflicted injur y 8. Law enforcement should have checked for weapons and drugs, but you may need to repeat the inspection Treatment and Intervention s 1. IV access for any fluids and meds 2. Give fluids for poor perfusion; cool fluids for hyperthermia [ See Shock Guideline and Hyperthermia/Heat Exposure Guideline ] 3. Treat chest pain as acute coronary syndrome ( ACS) and follow ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) Guideline if there is E KG is consistent with STEMI 4. Consider treating shortness of breath as atypical ACS a. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation 5. Consider soft physical management devices especially if law enforcement has been involved in getting patient to cooperate [ See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline ] 6. Consider medications to reduce agitation and other significant sympathomimetic findings , preferably benzodiazepines, for the safety of the patients and clinician s. The administration of ketamine should be considered for delirium with agitat ed behavior . This may improve behavior and compliance [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline ] a. If haloperidol or droperidol is used, maintain cardiac monitoring (or obtain 12 -lead EKGs) for QT -interval prolongation if feasible 7. Consider prophylactic use of antiemetic : a. Adult : administer ondansetron 4 -8 mg SLOW IV over 2 -5 minutes or 4 -8 mg IM or 8 mg orally disintegrating tablet b. Pediatric : Administer ondansetron 0.15 mg/kg SLOW IV over 2 -5 minutes c. Do not use promethazine if haloperidol or droperidol are t o be or have been given. They all increase QT prolongation, but ondansetron has less seizure risk 8. If hyperthermia suspected, begin external cooling ( e.g., cold or ice packs to axilla/groin) Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Apply the least amount of physical management devices that are necessary to protect the patient and the clinician s [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline ] 2. Assessment for potential weapons or additional drugs is very important since these items can pose a threat not just to the patient but also to the EMS cre w NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Stimulant Poisoning/Overdose 281 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. Recognition and treatment of hyperthermia (including sedatives to decrease heat production from muscular activity) is essential as many deaths are attributable to hyperthermia 2. If law enforcement has placed the patient in handcuffs, this patient needs ongoing physical security for safe transport. Have law enforcement in back of ambulance for the handcuffed patient or make sure proper non -handcuff physical management devices are in place before law enforcement leaves and ambulance departs from scene 3. If patient has signs and symptoms of ACS, consider giving nitroglycerin sublingual (SL) q (quaque, every) 3-5 minutes if SBP greater than 100 mmHg and until pain resolves (if range not desired, use q 3 minutes ) a. Vasospasm is often the problem in this case as opposed to a fixed coronary artery lesion b. Consider administration of benzodiazep ines as if to treat anxiety 4. Maintaining IV access, cardiac monitor, and SPO 2/EtCO 2 monitors are key to being able to catch and intervene decompensations in a timely manner a. If agitated, consider restraining the patient to facilitate patient assessment and lessen likelihood of vascular access or monitor displacements 5. Cocaine has sodium channel blocking effects and can cause significant cardiac conduction abnormalities with a widened QRS. Treatment is with sodium bicarbonate similar to a tricyclic antidepressant. Check a 12 -lead EKG to assess for these complications Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. History is as important as the physical examination. 2. If the patient is on psychiatric medication, but has failed to be compliant, this fact alone puts the patient at higher risk for the adverse outcome of delirium with agitated behavior 3. If the patient is found naked, this may elevate the suspicion for stimulant use or abuse . These substances increase the risk for sudden death secondary to delirium with agitated behavior . Neuroleptic malignant syndrome or serotonin syndrome can present with similar signs and symptoms 4. If polypharmacy is suspected, hypertension and tachycardia are expected hemodynamic findings secondary to increased dopamine release. Stimul us reduction from benzodiazepines, anti-psychotics, and ketamine will improve patient's vital signs and behavior 5. Be prepared for the potential of cardiovascular collapse as well as respiratory arrest 6. If a vasopressor is needed, epinephrine or norepinephrin e is recommended over dopamine Quality Improvemen t Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol .01) (for additional to www.nemsis.org ) 9914225 \u2014Medical - Stimulant Poisoning/Overdose Key Documentation Element s Reason for psychologic and physical management procedures used and neurologic/circulatory exams with device use Reason for medications selected NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

March 2022 Cyanide Exposure 283 Version 3.0 Cyanide Exposure Aliases Blood agent Cyanide Hydrogen cyanide Patient Care Goal s 1. Remove patient from toxic environment 2. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation , and correction of hypoperfusion Patient Presentatio n Cyanide is a colorless gas or white crystal which binds to the ferric ion in cells, blocking the enzyme cytochrome oxidase, thus preventing the use of oxygen by the cell's mitochondria, leading to cellular hypoxia . While it has a characteristic \"bitter almond smell\", genetically only 40% of the population can smell it Inclusion Criteria 1. Depending on its form, cyanide can enter the body through inhalation, ingestion, or absorption through the skin. Cyanide should be suspected in occupational or other smoke exposures ( e.g., firefighting), industrial accidents, natural cat astrophes, suicide and murder attempts, chemical warfare, and terrorism (whenever there are multiple casualties of an unclear etiology). Non -specific and early signs of cyanide exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or absorption) include the following signs and symptoms: anxiety, vertigo, weakness, headache, tachypnea, nausea, dyspnea, vomiting, and tachycardia 2. High concentrations of cyanide will produce: a. Markedly altered level of consciousness, including rapid collapse b. Seizures c. Respiratory depression or respira tory arrest d. Cardiac dysrhythmias (other than sinus tachycardia) 3. The rapidity of onset is related to the severity of exposure (inhalation or ingestion) and may be dramatic with immediate effects that include early hypertension with subsequent hypotension, sudden cardiovascular collapse or seizure/coma, and rapid death Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Managemen t Assessment 1. Remove patient from toxic environment 2. Assess ABCDs and, if indicated, expose the patient, and then re -cover the patient to assure retention of body heat 3. Assess vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment) including temperature and pulse oximetry (which may not correlate with tissue oxygenation in cyanide/smoke exposure) 4. Attach a cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias a. Perform a 12 -lead EK G 5. Check blood glucose level NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxi ns and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Cyanide Exposure 284 Version 3.0 6. Monitor pulse oximetry and EtCO 2 7. Monitor patient for signs of hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%) and respiratory decompensation regardless of pulse oximetry reading 8. Identify the specific agent of exposure, time of ingestion/inhalation, and quantity/timing of exposure 9. Obtain patient history including cardiovascular history and prescribed medication 10. Obtain other pertinent patient history 11. Perfo rm physical exam Treatment and Intervention s There is no widely available, rapid, confirmatory cyanide blood test. Many hospitals will not be able to rapidly assess cyanide levels. Therefore, treatment decisions must be made on the basis of clinical history and signs and symptoms of cyanide intoxication. For th e patient with an appropriate history and manifesting one or more significant cyanide exposure signs or symptoms, treat with: 1. 100% oxygen via non -rebreather mask, CPAP, or bag valve mas k 2. Collect a pre -treatment blood sample in the appropriate tube for lact ate and cyanide level s, if feasible 3. Administer one of the following medication regime s a. Hydroxocobalamin (the preferred agent ) i. Adult : Administer hydroxocobalamin 1. Initial dose is 5 g administered over 15 minutes slow IV 2. Each 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin for injection is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of LR, NS , or D5W (25 mg/ mL) and administered at 10 -15 mL/minut e 3. An additional 5 g dose may be administered with medical consultation. ii. Pediatric: Administer hydroxocobalamin 70 mg/kg (reconstitute concentration is 25 mg/ mL) 4. Each 5 g vial of hydroxocobalamin for injection is to be reconstituted with 200 mL of LR, NS , or DSW (25 mg/ mL) and administered at 10 -15 mL/minute i. Maximum single dose is 5 g OR b. Sodium thiosulfate i. Adult : Sodium thiosulfate 12.5 g IV F (50 mL of 25% solution) ii. Pediatric : Sodium thiosulfate 0.5 g/kg IV (2 mL/kg of 25% solution) 4. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline Patient Safety Consideration s 1. In the event of multiple casualties, be sure to wear appropriate PPE during rescue evacuation from the toxic environment 2. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas. Be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with vomiting or belching 3. Do not use nitrites in conju nction with suspected carbon monoxide poisoning as it worsens the hemoglobin oxygen carrying capacity even more than carbon monoxide (CO) 4. Hydroxocobalamin is only agent safe for treatment of cyanide poisoning in pregnant patients NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Cyanide Exposure 285 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. Pulse oximetry accurately reflects serum levels of oxygen but does not accurately reflect tissue oxygen levels therefore should not be relied upon in possible cyanide and/or carbon monoxide toxicity 2. After hydroxocobalamin has been administered, pulse oximetry levels are no longer accurate and skin, tears, and urine will all turn red. This flushing should not be interpreted as an allergic reaction 3. If the patient ingests cyanide, it will react with the acids in the stomach generating hydrogen cyanide gas. Be sure to maximize air circulation in closed spaces (ambulance) as the patient's gastric contents may contain hydrogen cyanide gases when released with vomiting or belching 4.

Monitor pulse oximetry and EtCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 6. Identify specific medication taken (noting immediate release vs. sustained release formulations), time of ingestion, and quantity 7. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease 8. Patient pertinent history 9. Patient physical Treatment and Interventions 1. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO only if within the first hour of ingestion , if indicated per the time of ingestion . If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agent without adequately protecting the airway a. If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agent without adequately protecting the airway 2. Check blood glucose level on all patients but especially on pediatric patients as beta - blockers can cause hypoglycemia in pediatric population 3. Consider atropine sulfate for symptomatic bradycardia a. Adult : Atropine 1 mg IV q 5 minutes to maximum of 3 mg b. Pediatric : Atropine 0 .02 mg/kg (0 .5 mg maximum) q 5 minutes, maximum total dose 1 mg 4. Consider fluid challenge (20 mL/kg) for hypotension with associated bradycardia 5. For symptomatic patients with cardiac effects ( e.g., hypotension, bradycardia) consider: a. Adult : Glucagon initial dose 5 mg IVP \u2014 this can be repeated in 5 -10 minutes for a total of 10 mg b. Pediatric : i. Glucagon 1 mg IVP (25 -40 kg) every 5 minutes as necessary ii. Glucagon 0.5 mg IVP (less than 25 kg) q 5 minutes as necessary 6. Consider vasopre ssors after adequate fluid resuscitation (1 -2 liters of crystalloid) for the hypotensive patient [ See Shock Guideline for pediatric vs. adult dosing] 7. Consider transcutaneous pacing if refractory to initial pharmacologic interventions 8. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline 9. If widened QRS (100 msec or greater), consider sodium bicarbonate 1 -2 mEq/kg IV. This can be repeated as needed to narrow QRS Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Transcutaneous pacing may not always capture nor correct hypotension when capture is successful 2. Aspiration of activated charcoal can cause airway management to be nearly impossible. Do not administer activated charcoal to any patients that may have a worsening mental status NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Beta Blocker Pois oning/Overdose 289 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. Pediatric Considerations a. Pediatric patient may develop hypoglycemia from beta blocker overdose therefore it is important to perform glucose evaluation b. A single pill can kill a toddler. It is very important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and all suspect medications should be brought into the ED 2. Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis may be considered 3. Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses) \u2014 the hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure may not respond to correction of bradycardia 4. Propranolol crosses the blood brain barrier and can cause altered mental status, seizure, and widened QRS similar to TCA toxicity Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Certain beta -blockers , such as acebutolol and propranolol, may increase QRS duration 2. Certain beta -blockers , such as acebutolol and pindolol, may produce tachycardia and hypertension 3. Sotalol can produce increase in QTc interval and ventricular dysrhythmias 4.

March 2022 Bites and Envenomation 291 Version 3.0 Bites and Envenomation Aliases Stings Patient Care Goal s Bites, stings, and envenomation s can come from a variety of insects, marine, and terrestrial animals. Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation , and correction of hypoperfusion. Provide pain control which also may include external interventions to reduce pa in Patient Presentatio n Inclusion Criteria 1. Bites, stings, and envenomations can come from a variety of marine and terrestrial animals and insects causing local or systemic effect s 2. Patients may present with toxin specific reactions which may include: a. Site pain b. Swelling c. Muscle pain (hallmark of black widow spider bites) d. Erythema e. Discoloration f. Bleeding g. Nausea h. Abdominal pain i. Hypotension j. Tachycardia k. Tachypnea I. Muscle incoordination m. Confusion n. Anaphylaxis/allergic reactions 3. There is a spectrum of toxins or envenomations and limited EMS interventions that will have any mitigating effect on the patient in the fiel d a. The critical intervention is to get the patient to a hospital that has access to the antivenin if applicable Exclusion Criteri a None note d Patient Managemen t Assessment 1. Assess ABCDs and if indicated expose and then cover to assure retention of body heat 2. Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment) which include temperature 3. Apply a cardiac monitor, examine rhythm strip for arrhythmias, and consider obtaining a 12 - lead EKG 4. Check blood glucose Level 5. Monitor pulse oximetry and E tCO2 for respiratory decompensation NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Bites and Envenomation 292 Version 3.0 6. Patient pertinent history 7. Patient physical with special consideration to area of envenomation especially crotalid bite Treatment and Intervention s 1. Consider an IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 20 mL/kg up to 2 liters 2. Consider vasopressors after adequate fluid resuscitation for the hypotensive patient [for adult vs. pediatric dosing , see Shock Guideline ] 3. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline 4. Specific therapy for select bites, stings, or envenomation a. Envenomations that are know n to antivenom readily available in the USA include black widow spider, bark scorpions, crotalid snakes (rattlesnake, copperhead) and coral snakes i. For these envenomations, consider transport to a hospital that has access to antivenom, if feasibl e b. Jellyfish i. As there is a significant variety and diversity of jellyfish, it is important to be familiar with the species and the appropriate treatment for your local aquatic creature s ii. Generally, scrape off any remaining tentacles or nematocysts, then immerse affected body part in hot water (113\u00b0F /45\u00b0C). Vinegar may be used to reduce pain due to deactivation of the nematocysts remaining in the skin except for stings from certain species of jellyfish (i.e., Physalia, a species found in Australian waters) which may have nematocysts activated by vinegar (acetic acid) . Vinegar may also activate the nematocysts of sea nettles and is not recommended after this type of jellyfish exposure c. Lionfish, scorpionfish, stingray : i. Immerse affected body part in hot water to reduce the pain associated with the toxin 5. Provide adequate analgesia per the Pain Management Guideline Patient Safety Considerations 1. Do NOT: a. Apply tourniquets, tight Ace\u00ae/crepe bandage, or constricting bands above or below the site of the envenomatio n b. Incise and /or suction wound to remove toxi n c. Apply cold packs or immerse the effect extremity in ice water (cryotherapy ) 2. EMS clinician s should not try to capture the marine or terrestrial animal or insec t 3. If the organism has been killed, beware that many dead insect, marine, or fanged animals can continue to bite or sting with venom and should be safely placed in a hard sided and closed container for future identificatio n 4. Patient may still have a n imbedded stinger, tooth, nematocyst, or barb which may continue to deliver toxin if left imbedded. Consider safe removal without squeezing the toxin delivery apparatus NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Bites and Envenomation 293 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s Vinegar has potential to increase pain associated with jellyfish sting as it can increase nematocyst discharge in certain species. Clinician s must be familiar with endemic species and how to best address exposure Pertinent Assessment Findings 1.

Physical exam Treatment and Intervention s 1. Consider activated charcoal without sorbitol (1 g/kg) PO only if within the first hour of ingestion , if indicated per the time of ingestion . If risk of rapid decreasing mental status, do not administer oral agent without adequately protecting the airway 2. Consider atropine sulfate for symptomatic bradycardi a a. Adult : atropine 1 mg IV q 5 minutes to maximum of 3 mg b. Pediatric : atropine 0 .02 mg/kg (0.5 mg maximum) q 5 minutes, maximum total dose 1 mg 3. Consider calcium gluconate or calcium chloride a. Calcium gluconate i. Adult : Calcium gluconate 2 -6 g slow IVP over 10 minutes ii. Pediatric : Calcium gluconate 60 mg/kg IVP over 10 minutes b. Calcium chloride i. Adult : Calcium chloride 0.5 -1 g slow IVP ( 50 mg/minute) ii. : Calcium chloride 20 mg/kg (0.2 mL/kg) slow IVP over 10 minutes (50 mg/mL) Maximum dose 1 g or 10 mL (Calcium gluconate is preferred as Calcium chloride has increased risk of tissue damage in pediatrics) 4. Consider IV fluid bolus (normal saline or lactated Ringer's) 20 mL/kg up to 2 liters 5. Consider vasopressors after adequate flui d resuscitation for the hypotensive patient [See Shock Guideline for adult vs. pediatric dosing] 6. If atropine, calcium , and vasopressors have failed in the symptomatic bradycardia patient, consider : a. Adult: Glucagon 5 mg IVP, then 1 mg q 5 minutes IVP (may require 5 -15 mg to see effect) b. Pediatric : i. Glucagon 1 mg IVP (25 -40 kg); q 5 minutes as necessar y ii. Glucagon 0.5 mg IVP (less than 25 kg); q 5 minutes as necessary 7. Consider transcutaneous pacing if refractory to initial pharmacologic interventions 8. If seizure, consider midazolam (benzodiazepine of choice ). [See Seizures Guideline for adult vs. pediatric dosing] Patient Safety Consideration s Transcutaneous pacing may not always capture nor corr ect hypotension when capture is successful. Notes/Educational Pearls Key Consideration s 1. While most calcium channel blockers cause bradycardia, dihydropyridine class calcium channel blockers (e.g., nifedipine, amlodipine) can cause a reflex tachycardia (torsade de pointes) early in the ingestion. The patient can become bradycardic as the intoxication worsens NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Calcium Channel Blocker Poisoning/Overdose 297 Version 3.0 2. The avoidance of administering calcium chloride or calcium gluconate to a patient on cardiac glycosides (e.g., digoxin) as this may prec ipitate toxicity and associate fatal arrhythmias is felt to be a historical belief and not supported 3. Glucagon has a side effect of increased vomiting at these doses and ondansetron prophylaxis should be considered 4. A single pill can kill a toddler. It is ve ry important that a careful assessment of medications the toddler could have access to is done by EMS and suspect medications brought into the ED 5. Calcium channel blockers can cause many types of rhythms that can range from sinus bradycardia to complete heart block 6. Hyperglycemia is the result of the blocking of L -type calcium channels in the pancreas. This can help differentiate these ingestions from beta -blockers . There may also be a relationship between the severity of the ingestion and the ext ent of the hyperglycemia 7. Atropine may have little or no effect (likely to be more helpful in mild overdoses) a. Hypotension and bradycardia may be mutually exclusive, and the blood pressure may not respond to correction of bradycardia Pertinent Assessment Fi ndings 1. Close monitoring of EKG changes and dysrhythmias 2.

Assure adequate ventilation, oxygenation, and correction of hypoperfusion. 3. Consider use of environmental carbon monoxide (CO) monitors on \"first in\" bags to assist in detection of occult CO toxicity. Patient Presenta tion Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas which has a high affinity for binding to red cell hemoglobin, thus preventing the binding of oxygen to the hemoglobin, leading to tissue hypoxia (although pulse oximetry may appear to be normal). A signific ant reduction in oxygen delivery to tissues and organs occurs with carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide is also a cellular toxin which can result in delayed or persistent neurologic sequelae in significant exposures. With any form of combustion (fire /smoke [e.g., propane, kerosene, or charcoal stoves or heaters], combustion engines [e.g., generators, lawn mowers, motor vehicles, home heating systems]), carbon monoxide will be generated. People in a fire may also be exposed to cyanide from the combusti on of some synthetic materials. Cyanide toxicity may need to be considered in the hemodynamically unstable patient removed from a fire. Inclusion Criteri a 1. Patients exposed to carbon monoxide may present with a spectrum of symptoms: a. Mild intoxication: i. Nausea ii. Fatigue iii. Headache iv. Vertigo v. Lightheadedness b. Moderate to severe: i. Altered mental status ii. Tachypnea iii. Tachycardia iv. Convulsion v. Cardiopulmonary arrest Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Managemen t Assessment 1. Remove patient from toxic environment 2. Assess ABCDs and, if indicated, expose patient and re -cover to assure retention of body heat 3.

Check blood glucose level 6. Monitor pulse oximetry and EtCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 7. Patient pertinent history 8. Patient physical examination Treatment and Int ervention s 1. 100% oxygen via non -rebreather mask or high flow oxygen by nasal cannula (HFNC) or CPAP or bag valve mask or advanced airway as indicated 2. If seizure, treat per Seizures Guideline 3. Consider transporting patients with s evere carbon monoxide poisoning directly to a facility with hyperbaric oxygen capabilities if feasible and patient does not meet criteria for other specialty care (e.g., trauma or burn) Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Consider affixing a carbon monoxide det ector to an equipment bag that is routinely taken into scene (if it signals alarm, don appropriate respiratory protection and exit scene) to assist with detection of occult CO toxicity 2. Remove patient and response personnel from potentially hazardous enviro nment as soon as possible 3. Provide instruction to the patient, the patient's family, and other appropriate bystanders to not enter the environment (e.g., building, car) where the carbon monoxide exposure occurred until the source of the poisoning has been e liminated 4. Do not look for cherry red skin coloration as an indication of carbon monoxide poisoning, as this is an unusual finding 5. CO oximeter devices may yield inaccurate low/normal results for patients with CO poisoning. All patients with probable or susp ected CO poisoning should be transported to the nearest appropriate hospital based on their presenting signs and symptoms Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. Pulse oximetry is inaccurate due to the carbon monoxide binding with hemoglobin 2. As maternal carboxyhemoglobin levels do not accurately reflect fetal carboxyhemoglobin levels, pregnant patients are more likely to be treated with hyperbaric oxygen 3. Consider cyanide toxicity if carbon monoxide poisoning is from a fire Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Early and repeat assessment of patient's mental status and motor function are extremely useful in determining response to therapy and the need for hyperbaric therapy 2.

Rapid recognition and intervention of a clinically significant opioid poisoning or overdose 2. Prevention of respiratory and/or cardiac arrest Patient Presentatio n Inclusion Criteri a Patients exhibiting decreased mental status, and respiratory depression of all age groups with known or suspected opioid use or abuse. L ack of miosis (pinpoint pupils) is not a reliable sign for ruling out opioid exposure, although its presence is consistent with such exposure Exclusion Criteria Patients with altered mental status e xclusively from other causes (e.g., head injury, or hypoglycemia ) Patient Managemen t 1. Don the appropriate PPE . Note that opioids have minimal vapor pressure and do not pose an exposure risk to rescuers unless aerosolized or ingested 2. Therapeutic interventio ns to support the patient's airway, breathing, and circulation should be initiated prior to the administration of naloxone 3. If possible, identify specific medication taken (including immediate release versus sustained release) time of ingestion, and quantit y 4. Obtain and document pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease 5. Be aware that unsecured hypodermic needles may be on scene if the intravenous route may have been used by the patient, and that there is a higher risk of needle sticks during the management of this patient population which may also have an increased incidence of blood - borne pathogens 6. Naloxone, an opioid antagonist, should be considered for administration to patients with respiratory depression in a confirmed or suspected opioid overdose 7. Naloxone administration via the intravenous route provides more predictable bioavailability and flexibility in dosing and titration 8. Naloxone administration via the intranasal or intramuscular routes or as a nebulized solution provide additional options of medication delivery 9. If naloxone was administered to the patient prior to the arrival of EMS, obtain the dose and route through which it was administered and, if possible, bring the devices containing the dispensed nal oxone with the patient along with all other medications on scene NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Opioid Poisoning/Overdose 304 Version 3.0 Assessment 1. Assess the patient's airway, breathing, circulation, and mental status 2. Support the patient's airway by positioning, oxygen administration, and ventilator assistance with a bag valve mask if necessary 3. Assess the patient for other etiologies of altered mental status including hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%), hypoglycemia, hypotension, and traumatic head injury 4. Legally prescribed opioids are also manufactured as an adhesive patch for transdermal absorption, and if found, should be removed from the skin Treatments and Interventions 1. Critical resuscitation (opening and/or maintaining the airway , provision of oxygen, ensuring adequate circulation) should be performed prior to naloxone administration 2. If the patient has respiratory depression from a confirmed or suspected opioid overdose , consider naloxone administration a. The administration of the initial dose or subsequent doses can be incrementally titrated until respiratory dep ression is reversed 3. Naloxone can be administered via the IV, IM, IN, or ETT routes. As the ETT route is not very effective, its use should be reserved for dire circumstances with a patient in extremis with no other choice a. Adults : The typical initial adult dose ranges between 0.4 -2 mg IV, IM, up to a dose of 4 mg IN or 5 mg ETT b. Pediatrics : The pediatric dose of naloxone is 0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, IN, or ETT i. Maximum dose of 2 mg IV, IM, or ETT ii. Maximum dose of 4 mg IN 4. Naloxone can be administered via the IV, IM, IN, or ETT routes. As the ETT route is not very effective, its use should be reserved for dire circumstances with a patient in extremis with no other choice a. Adults : The typical initial adult dose ranges between 0.4 -2 mg IV, IM, up to a dose of 4 mg IN or 5 mg ETT b. Pediatrics : The pediatric dose of naloxone is 0.1 mg/kg IV, IM, IN, or ETT i. Maximum dose of 2 mg IV, IM, or ETT ii. Maximum dose of 4 mg IN c. Naloxone provided to laypersons and non -medical first responders via public access programs or prescriptions may be provided as a pre -measured dose in an auto -injector or nasal spray or as a pre -measured, but variable, dose and/or concentration in a needleless syringe with a mucosal atomization device (MAD) on the hub d. Naloxone auto -injectors contain 0.4 mg/0.4 mL or 2 mg/0.4 mL i. The cartons of naloxone auto -injectors prescribed to laypersons contain two naloxone auto -injectors and one trainer e. Naloxone nasal spray is manufactured in a single -use bottle that contains 4 mg/0.1 mL f. For the intranasal route when naloxone is administered via a needleless syringe (preferably with MAD on the hub), divide administration of the dose equally between the nostrils to a maximum of 1 mL per nostr il g. The administration of naloxone can be titrated until adequate respiratory effort is achieved if administered with a syringe IV, IM, IN, or ET T h. Naloxone has no benefit in the treatment of cardiac arrest. Do not delay other NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Opioid Poisoning/Overdose 305 Version 3.0 interventions such as chest compressions and ventilations 5. High -potency opioids [ See Key Considerations ] may require higher and/or more frequently administered doses of naloxone to reverse respiratory depression and/or to maintain adequate respirations 6. Regardless of the doses of naloxone adm inistered, airway management with provision of adequate oxygenation and ventilation is the primary goal in patients with confirmed or suspected opioid overdose Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Clinical duration of naloxone a. The clinical opioid reversal effect of naloxone is limited and may end within an hour whereas opioids often have a duration of 4 hours or longer b. Monitor the patient for recurrent respiratory depression and decreased mental status 2. Opioid withdrawal a. Patients with altered mental status seconda ry to an opioid overdose may become agitated or violent following naloxone administration due to opioid withdrawal therefore the goal is to use the lowest dose as possible to avoid precipitating withdrawal b. Be prepared for this potential scenario and take t he appropriate measures in advance to ensure and maintain scene safety 3. EMS clinician s should be prepared to initiate airway management before, during, and after naloxone administration and to provide appropriate airway support until the patient has adequat e respiratory effort Notes /Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. The essential feature of opioid overdose requiring EMS intervention is respiratory depression or apnea, managed by ventilation followed by naloxon e 2. Some opioids have additional toxic effects ( i.e., methadone can produce QT prolongation and tramadol can produce seizures) 3. Overuse and abuse of prescribed and illegal opioids has led to an increase in accidental and intentional opioid overdoses 4. Opioid combinations: a. Some opioids a combination of analgesics with acetaminophen, acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), or other substances b. In the scenario of an overdose, there is a potential for multiple drug toxicities c. Examples of opioid combination analgesics: i. Vicodin \u00ae a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone ii. Percocet \u00ae is a combination of acetaminophen and oxycodone iii. Percodan \u00ae is a combination of aspirin and oxycodone iv. Suboxone \u00ae is a combination of buprenorphine and 5. High -potency opioids: a. Fentanyl is 50 -100 tim es more potent than morphine . It is legally manufactured in an injectable and oral liquid, tablet, and transdermal (worn as a patch) forms however much of the fentanyl adulterating the heroin supply are illegal fentanyl analogs such as acetyl fentanyl b. Carfentanil is 10,000 times more potent than morphine i. It is legally manufactured in a liquid form; however, a powder or tablet is the NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Opioid Poisoning/Overdose 306 Version 3.0 most common form of this drug that is illegally produced ii. In the concentration in which it is legally manufactured (3 mg/ mL), an intramuscular dose of 2 mL of carfentanil will sedate an elephant c. Synthetic opioids ( i.e., W-18 are 10,000 times more potent than morphine) many synthetic opioids are not detectable by routine toxicology screening assays 6. The IN route has the benefit of no risk of needle stick to the clinician 7. Patients with opioid overdose from fentanyl or fentanyl analogs may rapidly exhibit chest wall rigidity and require positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), in addition to multiple an d/or larger doses of naloxone, to achieve adequate ventilation Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. The primary clinical indication for the use of opioid medications is analgesia 2. In the opioid overdose scenario, signs and symptoms include: a. Miosis (pinpoint pupils) b. Respiratory depression c. Decreased mental status 3. Additional assessment precautions: a. The risk of respiratory arrest with subsequent cardiac arrest from an opioid overdose as well as hypoxia (pulse oximetry less than 94%), hypercarbia, and as piration may be increased when other substances such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, or other medications have also been taken by the patient b. Pediatric Considerations : The signs and symptoms of an opioid overdose may also be seen in newborns who have been del ivered from a mother with recent or chronic opioid use. Neonates who have been administered naloxone for respiratory depression due to presumed intrauterine opioid exposure may be narcotic dependent and should be monitored closely for seizures Quality Imp rovemen t Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01 \u2014Medical - Opioid Poisoning/Overdose Key Documentation Element s Rapid and accurate identification of signs and symptoms of opioid poisoning Airway management Pulse oximetry (oxygen saturation) and, if available, capnometry or capnography Blood glucose assessment Naloxone dose and route of administration Clinical response to medication ad ministration Number of doses of naloxone to achieve a clinical response Performance Measure s Clinical improvement after prehospital administration of naloxone The performance and ongoing assessment of airway management Frequency of patients who develop ad verse effects or complications (recurrent respiratory depression or decreased mental status, aspiration pneumonia or pulmonary edema) Number of patients who refuse transport following naloxone administration NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

Inhalation of a variety of gases, mists, fumes, aerosols, or dusts may cause irritation or injury to the airways, pharynx, lung, asphyxiation, or other systemic effects 2. Inhaled airway/respiratory irritant agents will interact with the mucous membranes , upper and lower airways based on solubility, concentration, particle size, and duration of exposure 3. The less soluble and smaller the particle size of the agent the deeper it will travel into the airway and respiratory systems the inhaled toxic agent will go before reacting with adjoini ng tissues thus causing a greater delay in symptom onset Signs and Symptom s 1. As the type, severity and rapidity of signs and symptom onset depends on agent, water solubility, concentration, particle size, and duration of exposure, the below signs and symptoms are often overlapping and escalating in severity 2. Many airways and respiratory irritant agents have \"warning properties\" such as identifiable or unpleasant smells or irritation to eyes or airways 3. Some agents do not have clear warning properties and will often have delayed onset of any sign or symptom: a. Unusual odor /smell b. Tearing or itchy eyes c. Burning sensation and burns to the nose, pharynx, and respiratory tract d. Sneezing e. General excitation f. Cough g. Chest tightness h. Nausea i. Shortness of breath /dyspnea j. Whe ezing k.

Rapidly assess the patient's respiratory status, mental status, and oxygenatio n 4. Administer (humidified if available) oxygen 5. Establish intravenous access (if possible) 6. Apply a cardiac monitor (if available) 7. Continuous and ongoing patient reassessment is critical Assessment 1. Make sure the scene is safe as many gases are heavier than air and will build up in low lying areas. This is especially true of hydrogen sulfide and it's \"knock down\" effect of the initial unprotected responder and subsequence casualties associated with unprote cted rescuers attempting to safe the first downed responder 2. Consider BSI or appropriate PPE 3. Remove patient from toxic environment 4. Decontaminate 5. Assess ABCD and if indicated, expose the patient, and then cover the patient to assure retention of body heat 6. Vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, neurologic status assessment) which include temperature NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Airway Respiratory Irritants 313 Version 3.0 7. Place cardiac monitor and examine rhythm strip for arrhythmia potentials (consider 12 -lead EKG) 8. Check blood glucose Level 9. Monitor pulse oximetry and EtCO 2 for respiratory decompensation 10. Perform carboxyhemoglobin and cyanide device assessment, if available 11. Identify specific suspected agent if possible 12. Pertinent cardiovascular history or other prescribed medications for underlying disease 13. Patient pertin ent history 14. Patient physical examination Treatment and Intervention s 1. Assure a patent airwa y 2. Administer (humidified if available) oxygen and if hypoventilation, toxic inhalation, or desaturation noted, support breathing a. Maintain the airway and assess for airway burns, stridor, or airway edema and if indicated, perform intubation early (recommendation to avoid supraglottic airways \u2014 cricothyrotomy may be required in rare severe cases b. Non-invasive ventilation techniques i. Use continuous CPAP, BiPAP, intermittent positive pressure breathing (IPPB), HFNC, and/or bilevel nasal CPAP for severe respiratory distress or impending respiratory failure ii. Use bag -valve -mask (BVM) ventilation in the setting of hypoventilation, respiratory failure, or arre st 3. While albuterol 2.5 mg nebulized is usually sufficient for mild wheezing without clinical distress, albuterol 5 mg nebulized (or 6 puffs metered dose inhaler) should be administe red to all patients in respiratory distress with signs of bronchospasm either by basic life support BLS or ALS clinician s. This medication should be repeated at this dose with unlimited frequency for ongoing distress 4. lpratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given up to 3 doses, in conjunction with albu terol 5. Initiate IV access for infusion of lactated Ringer's or normal saline and obtain blood samples in effort to record pre -treatment levels, e.g., via point -of-care testing, associated with EMS manag ement (e.g., glucose, lactate, cyanide ) 6. Fluid bolus (20 mL/kg) if evidence of hypoperfusio n 7. If the patient is experiencing significant pain, administer IV/ IO analgesics a. Morphine sulfate 0.1 mg/kg IV or IO b. Fentanyl 1 mcg/kg IV or IO 8. Eye irrigation early 9. Treat topical chemical burns [ See appropriate Toxins and Environmental Section guideline (s)] 10. In severe respiratory irritation, in particular hydrogen sulfide, with altered mental status and no improvement with removal from the toxic environment, administer oxygen (humidified if available) as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation . Consider consultation for transfer to a tertiary care hospital. If carbon monoxide is a confirmed or suspected element of the inhalant, a facility with hyperbaric oxygen capabilities is preferred NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Airway Respiratory Irritants 314 Version 3.0 Medication Administration 1. If wheezing is present, consider administering inhaled albuterol (2.5-5 mg) as nebulized, or four to eight puffs metered dose inhaler 2. lpratropium 0.5 mg nebulized should be given in conjunction with albuterol, up to three doses Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Generally, speaking to patients with exposure to highly soluble airway/respiratory irritants you will find that they have s elf-extricated due to the warning properties such as the smell, rapidity of onset of irritation, and other symptoms 2. The less soluble agents may generate only an odor ( e.g., mowed hay smell for Phosgene) and will have delayed serious symptoms such as acute pulmonary edema, hypoxia, and shortness of breath with minimal exertion Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. Airway respiratory irritants can exacerbate underlying reactive airway diseases (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ) and precipitate or exacerbate bronchospasm, respiratory distress, and hypoxia 2. As patients may be off gassing (particularly hydrogen sulfide and hydrogen cyanide) in the back of the transport vehicle, it is important to have adequate ventilation of the pa tient compartment 3. Removal from the toxic environment, oxygen (humidified if available), general supportive therapy, bronchodilators, respiratory support, and rapid transport are core elements of care as there are no specific antidotes for any of these inha led agents except for heavy metals that may be chelated in -hospital after agent identification 4. Hydrogen sulfide causes the cells responsible for the sense of smell to be stunned into inaction and therefore with a very short exposure will shut down and the exposed victim will not perceive the smell, yet the victim continues to absorb the gas as it is still present 5. Inhaled agents have become popular as a means of committing suicide. If there is some form of suicide signage, hoses, or buckets of substances visible as you arrive at the vehicle or residence, immediately retreat to well ventilated area and don self-contained breathing apparatus ( SCBA ) before opening the vehicle or making entry as these gases may be highly concentrated and potentially lethal to EMS responders 6. Househ old bathroom, kitchen, and oven cleaners when mixed can generate various airway respiratory irritants (ammonia, chloramine, and chlorine gas releases are particularly common). A very common exposure is to chloramine, a gas liberated w hen bleach (hypochlorite) and ammonia are combined. Chloramine then hydrolyzes in the distal airways and alveoli to ammonia and hypochlorous acid 7. Sudden sniffing death can result from a single use of inhalant of abuse a. Some inhalants can cause cardiac arres t due to dysrhythmias from irritated myocardium b. This syndrome most often is associated with abuse of butane, propane, and effects of the chemicals in the aerosols Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Patient may describe a specific odor (chlorine swimming pool smell, ammonia smell, NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

Cooling efforts should continue until the patient's temperature is less than 102.2\u00b0F (39\u00b0C) or, if continuous temperature monitoring is not available, until the patient demonstrates improvement in mental status 9. Establish IV access for patients suffering from heat stroke \u2014 give cool fluids at 20 mL/kg boluses and reduce to 10 mL/kg/hr boluses when vitals are stable 10. Monitor for arrhythmia and cardiovascular collapse [ See Cardiovascular Section ] 11. Treat seizures, per the Seizures Guideline 12. All patients suffering from life threatening heat illness (including heat stroke) should be tran sported to the hospi tal Patient Safety Consideration s Consider use of physical securing devices [ See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline ] to protect vascular access sites. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Hyperthermia/Heat Exposure 323 Version 3.0 Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Patients at risk for heat emergencies include neonates, infants, geriatric patients, and patients with mental illness 2. Contributory risk factors may come from: a. Prescription and over -the-counter herbal supplements b. Cold medications c. Heart medications d. Diuretics e. Psychiatric medications f. Drug abuse g. Accidental or intentional drug overdose 3. Heat exposure can occur either due to increased environmental temperatures or prolonged exercise or a combination of both a. Environments with temperature greater than 90\u00b0F and humidity greater than 60% present the most risk 4. Heat stroke is associated with cardiac arrhythmias independent of drug ingestion/overdose Heat stroke has also been associated with cerebral edema 5. For patients with signs and symptoms of heat stroke, rapid cooling takes priority over other interventions (e.g., cardiac monitoring, IV access) 6. Do not forget to look for other causes of altered mental status such as low blood glucose level, or, in the proper circumstances ( i.e., endurance exercise events), consider exercise associated hyponatremia (EAH), especially in the patient with altered mental status, normal blood glucose, and normal temperature 7. Controversy: shivering may occur while treating heat stroke a. It is uncertain how harmful shivering is to heat stroke patients b. Cooling should be continued until the above temperature and mental status goals are met c. Treat shivering as above d.

Prevent further heat loss 3. Rewarm the patient in a safe manner 4. Appropria te management of hypothermia induced cardiac arrest 5. Prevent loss of limbs Patient Presentatio n 1. Patients may suffer from hypothermia due to exposure to a cold environment (increased heat loss) or may suffer from a primary illness or injury that, in combination with cold exposure (heat loss in combination with decreased heat production), leads to hypo thermia 2. Patients may suffer systemic effects from cold (hypothermia) or localized effects ( i.e., frostbite) 3. Patients with mild hypothermia will have normal mental status, shivering, and may have normal vital signs while patients with moderate to severe hyp othermia will manifest mental status changes, eventual loss of shivering and progressive bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased respiratory status 4. Patients with frostbite will develop numbness involving the affected body part along with a \"clumsy\" feeling along with areas of blanched skin \u2014 later findings include a \"woody\" sensation, decreased or loss of sensation, bruising or blister formation, or a white and waxy appearance to affected tissue Inclusion Criteria Patients suffering systemic or localized c old injuries. Exclusion Criteria 1. Patients without cold exposure OR 2. Patients with cold exposure but no symptoms referable to hypothermia or frostbit e Patient Manageme nt Assessment 1. Patient assessment should begin with attention to the primary survey, looking for evidence of circulatory collapse and ensuring effective respirations a. The patient suffering from moderate or severe hypothermia may have severe alterations in vital signs including weak and extremely slow pulses, profound hypotension, and decreased respirations b. The rescuer may need to evaluate the hypothermic patient for a pulse for longer than the normothermic patient (up to 60 seconds) 2. History : along with standard SAMPLE \u2014 type history, additional patient history should include : NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Hypothermia/Cold Exposure 327 Version 3.0 a. Attention to any associated injury or illnes s b. Duration of cold exposure c. Ambient temperature d. Treatments initiated before EMS arrival 3. There are several means to categorize the severity of hypothermia based on either core body temperature readings or clinical evaluation. If possible and reliable, EMS clinicians should perform core body temperature measurements and categorize patients into one of the three follow levels of hypothermia: a. Mild : 32.1\u00b0 -35\u00b0C/89.8\u00b0 -95\u00b0F b. -28\u00b0C/75.2\u00b0 -82.4\u00b0F d. Profound : less than 24\u00b0C (75.2\u00b0F) 4. Equally important is the patient's clinical presentation and the signs or symptoms the patient is experiencing \u2014 the above temperature -based categorization should be balanced against these clinical findings a. Mild : vital signs not depressed ; normal mental status; shivering is preserved; body maintains the ability to attempt to control temperature b. Moderate/Severe : progressive bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased respirations, alterations in mental status with eventual coma, shivering will be lost in moderate hypothermia (generally between 3 0\u00b0-31\u00b0C (86\u00b0-87.8\u00b0F ), and general slowing of bodily functions; the body loses the ability to thermo -regulate Treatment and Intervention s 1. Maintain patient and rescuer safet y 2. Manage airway per the Airway Management Guideline 3. Mild hypothermia : a. Remove the patient from the environment and prevent further heat loss by removing wet clothes and drying skin, insulate from the ground, shelter the patient from wind and wet conditions, and insulate the patient with dry clothing or a hypothermia wrap /blanket. Cover the patient with a vapor barrier and, if available, move the p atient to a warm environment b. Hypothermic patients have decreased oxygen needs and may not require supplemental oxygen i. If oxygen is deemed necessary, it should be warmed to a maximum temperature between 40\u00b0-42\u00b0C (104\u00b0 -108\u00b0F ) and humidified if possible c. Provide beverages or foods containing glucose if feasible and patient is awake and able to manage airway independently d. Vigorous shivering can substantially increase heat production \u2014 shivering should be fueled by caloric replacement e. Consider field -rewarmin g methods such as placement of large heat packs or heat blankets (chemical or electric if feasible) to the anterior chest or wrapped around the patient's thorax if large enough \u2014 forced air warming blankets ( e.g., Bair Hugger\u00ae) can be an effective field re warming method if available f. Monitor frequently \u2014 if temperature or level of consciousness decreases, refer to severe hypothermia g. Consider IV access i. Indications for IV access and IV fluids in the mildly hypothermic patient are NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Hypothermia/Cold Exposure 328 Version 3.0 similar to those of the non -hypothermic patient ii. IV fluids, if administered, should be warmed, ideally to 42\u00b0C (107.6\u00b0F) iii. Bolus therapy is preferable to continuous drip h. If alterations in mental status, consider measuring blood glucose and treat as indicated (treat per Hypoglycemia Guideline or Hyperglycemia Guideline ) and assess for other causes of alterations of mentation i. Transport to a hospital capable of rewar ming the patient 4. Moderate or severe hypothermia : a. Perform ABCs (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) , pulse checks for patients suffering hypothermia should be performed for 60 seconds, and obtain core temperature, if possible, for patients exhibiting signs or symptoms of moderate/severe hypothermia i. Core temperatures can be measured by esophageal probe, if one is available, the patient's airway is secured, and the clinician has been trained in its insertion and use. ii. Rectal temperatures may also be used, with caution to avoid worsening the hypothermia by undressing the patient (e.g., done in a warm environment such as a heated ambulance) iii. If neither esophageal nor rectal thermometers are available, an epitympanic field thermom eter with an isolating ear cap may be used, but is generally less accurate b. Manage airway as needed i. Care must be taken not to hyperventilate the patient as hypocarbia may reduce the threshold for ventricular fibrillation in the cold patient ii. Indications and contraindications for advanced airway devices are similar in the hypothermic patient as in the normothermic patient c. Prevent further heat loss by removing the patient from the environment and removing wet clothes and drying skin, insulate from the ground, s helter the patient from wind and wet conditions, and insulate the patient with dry clothing or a hypothermia wrap /blanket. Cover the patient with a vapor barrier and, if available, move the patient to a warm environment d. Initiate field -rewarming methods suc h as placement of large heat packs or heat blankets (chemical or electric if feasible) to the anterior chest or wrapped around the patient's thorax if large enough i. Chemical or electrical heat sources should never be applied directly to the skin ii. Use a barrier between the skin and heat source to prevent burns iii. Forced air warming blankets ( e.g., Bair Hugger \u00ae) can be an effective field rewarming method if available e. Handle the patient gently i. Attempt to keep the patient in the horizontal position, especially limiting motion of the extremities to avoid increasing return of cold blood to the heart ii. Once in a warm environment, clothing should be cut off (rather than removed by manipulating the extremities) iii. Move the patient only when necessary, such as to remove th e patient from the elements f. Apply cardiac monitor or AED if available g. Establish IV and provide warmed isotonic crystalloid bolus. Repeat as necessar y h. If alterations in mental status, consider measuring blood glucose and treat as indicated ( treat per Hypoglycemia Guideline or Hyperglycemia Guideline ) and assess NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Hypothermia/Cold Exposure 329 Version 3.0 for other causes of alterations of mentation i. Transport as soon as possible to a hospital capable of resuscitation . If cardiac arr est develops consider transport to a center capable of extracorporeal circulation (ECMO) or cardiopulmonary bypass (if feasible) j. Warm the patient compartment of the ambulance to at least 24\u00b0C (75.2\u00b0F) during transpor t 5. Frost bite : a. If the patient has evidence of frostbite, and ambulation/travel is necessary for evacuation or safety, avoid rewarming of extremities until definitive treatment is possible. Additive injury occurs when the area of frostbite is rewarmed then inadvertently refrozen. Only initi ate rewarming if refreezing is absolutely preventable i. If rewarming is feasible and refreezing can be prevented use circulating warm water (37 \u00b0-39\u00b0C/98.6 \u00b0-102\u00b0F) to affected body part, thaw injury completely. If warm water is not available, rewarm frostbitten parts by contact with non - affected body surfaces. Do not rub or cause physical trauma. ii. After rewarming, cover injured parts with loose sterile dressing. If blisters are causing significant pain, and the clinician is so trained, these may be aspirated, however, should not be de -roofed. Do not allow injury to refreeze. Treat per the Pain Management Guideline . Patient Safety Consideratio ns 1. Given the additive effects of additional cold stress, the patient should be removed from the cold environment as soon as operationally feasible 2. In patients suffering from moderate to severe hypothermia, it is critical to not allow these patients to stand or exercise as this may cause circulatory collapse 3. Devices that self -generate heat ( e.g., heat packs) that are being utilized during the rewarming process should be wrapped in a barrier to avoid direct contact with the skin and to prevent burns. Available evidence suggests that heat packs with peak temperatures above 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F) are most like ly to cause burns. In patients who are unresponsive, or unable to recognize a developing injury, please check the area in which the heating pad is placed regularly to ensure no tissue damage occurs. Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s Consideratio ns in cardiac arrest 1. The following are contraindications for initiation of resuscitation in the hypothermic patient: a. Obvious fatal injuries (such as decapitation) b. The patient exhibits signs of being frozen (such as ice formation in the airway) c. Chest wall rigidity such that compressions are impossible d. Danger to rescuers or rescuer exhaustion e. Avalanche victims buried for 35 minutes or longer with airway obstruction by ice or snow 2. Fixed and dilated pupils, apparent rigor mortis, and dependent lividity ma y not be contraindication for resuscitation in the severely hypothermic patien t 3. The mainstay of therapy in severe hypothermia and cardiac arrest should be effective chest compressions and attempts at rewarming . Chest compressions NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmen tal Rev. March 2022 Hypothermia/Cold Exposure 330 Version 3.0 should be provided at the same rate as in normothermic patients 4. The temperature at which defibrillation should first be attempted in the severely hypothermic cardiac arrest victim and the number of defibrillation attempts is unclear. There are different approaches regarding res uscitation of the hypothermic arrest patient a. Per the American Heart Association (AHA), if the patient has a shockable rhythm (VF/VT), defibrillation should be attempted . It is reasonable to continue defibrillation attempts per AHA protocols concurrently with rewarming strategies b. The state of Alaska's 2014 guidance on management of hypothermic patients in cardiac arrest advises that defibrillation should be attempted once, followed by 2 minutes of chest compressions, then rhythm and pulse checks i. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core temperature is less than 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), do not make further attempts at defibrillation until the core temperature has increase d to greater than 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F ) ii. Continue CPR and attempt to rewarm the patient c. An alternate strategy, per the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline, suggests that if the patient's core temperature is below 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), attempt defibri llation once, then wait until the patient has been rewarmed at least 1\u00b0-2\u00b0C or to 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F) before attempting additional shocks. It is noted that the likelihood of successful defibrillation increases with every one -degree increase in temperat ure d. If defibrillation is unsuccessful and the patient's core temperature is greater than 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), follow guidelines for normothermic patients e. If available monitors reveal asystole, CPR alone is the mainstay of therapy f. If monitoring reveals an organized rhythm (other than VF or VT) and no pulses are detected, do not start CPR, but continue to monitor i. While this may represent pulseless electrical activity (PEA), this may also represent situations in which the patient's pulses are not detectable but remain effect ive due to decreased metabolic needs ii. In the case of PEA, the rhythm will deteriorate rapidly to asystole, in which case, CPR should be initiated iii. Given the potential to cause VF with chest compressions, the Alaska guidance offers that it is better to mainta in effective cardiac activity than to start CPR and cause VF 5. Manage the airway per standard care in cardiac arrest victims [ See Cardiac Arrest Guideline ] a. In the absence of advanced airways, ventilate the patient at the same rate as a normothermic patien t b. If the patient has an advanced airway, ventilate at half the rate recommended for a normothermic patient to prevent hyperventilation. If EtCO 2 is available, ventilate to maintain normal EtCO 2 levels 6. There is little evidence to guide use of medications in severe hypothermia with cardiac arrest, however 2010 AHA updates to advanced cardiac life support recommend use of vasopressors according to standard ACLS protocols while the 2014 Alaska guide lines and the Wilderness Medical Society's accidental hypothermia guideline for the management of hypothermic patients advises medications should be withheld until the patient's core temperature is greater than 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F ) a. Above 30\u00b0C (86\u00b0F), intervals betw een medication provision should be doubled until the NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Hypothermia/Cold Exposure 331 Version 3.0 patient reaches 35\u00b0C (95\u00b0F), at which time, normal medication intervals may be adopted 7. Upon ROSC, treat per Adult Post -ROSC Care Guideline 8. Patients with severe hypothermia and arrest may benefit from resuscitation even after prolonged downtime, and survival with intact neurologic function has been observed even after prolonged resuscitation a. Patients should not be considered deceased until rewarming has been atte mpted 9. If a hypothermic patient clearly suffered cardiac arrest and subsequently became hypothermic afterward with prolonged down time between arrest and rescue, there is no rationale for initiating resuscitation and warming the patient Pertinent Assessment Findings 1.

Consider CPAP in awake patients with respiratory distress 12. Cardiac monito r Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Avoidance of hyperoxygenation of the drowning victim 2. Rescuer safety considerations Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. The World Health Organization definition of drowning is \" the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from submersion/immersion in liquid \" 2. Drowning is further defined in the following categories : a. Non-fatal drowning : patients rescued from drownin g b. Fatal drowning : any death, acutely or subacutely, resulting from drownin g 3. Submersion refers to situations in which the patient's airway is underwater. Immersion refers to situations in which the patient's body is in water, but the patient's airway remains out of the wat er 4. Pediatric Consideration s: a. Drowning is a common cause of death in children b. Risk factors for drowning include male gender, age less than 14 years old , alcohol use, lack of supervision, and risky behavior 5. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure patient is rapidly accessed and removed from the water 6. Initiation of in -water ventilations may increase survival . In-water chest compressions are futile 7. The European Resuscitati on Council recommends five initial breaths be provided to the drowning victim a. The initial ventilations may be more difficult to achieve as water in the airways may impede alveolar expansio n b. If cardiac arrest a fter 5 rescue breaths, refer to Cardiac Arrest Guideline . NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Drowning 335 Version 3.0 8. Active efforts to expel water from the airway (by abdominal thrusts or other means) should be avoided as they delay resuscitative efforts and incr ease the potential for vomiting and aspiration 9. Long -standing teaching has suggested that rescuers should always assume c-spine injury in victims of drowning a. The 2010 American Heart Association update on special circumstances in cardiac arrest notes that routine c -spine precautions in all victims of drowning is likely unnecessary unless the mechanism or injury, history, or physical exam suggests a cervical spine injury b. Mechanisms of injury highly suggestive of cervical spine injury include diving, water skiing, surfing, or watercraft accidents 10. Uncertainty exists regarding survival in cold water drowning; however, recent literature suggests the following : a. If water temperature is less than 43\u00b0F (6\u00b0C) and the patient is submerged with evidence of cardiac arres t: i. Survival is possible for submersion time less than 90 minutes and resuscitative efforts should be initiated ii. Survival is not likely for submersion time greater than 90 minutes and clinician s may consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of resuscitation on scene b. If water temperature is greater than 43\u00b0F (6\u00b0C) and the patient is submerged with evidence of cardiac arrest: i. Survival is possible for submersion time less than 30 minutes and resuscitative efforts should be initiated ii. Survival is not likely for submersion time greater than 30 minutes and clinician s may consider not initiating resuscitation or termination of resuscitation on scene 11. Patients may develop subacute respiratory difficulty after drowning and therefore all victims of drowning should be transported for observation 12. Decompression illness may have a variety of presentations depending on syste m affected (e.g., skin, joint(s), pulmonary, neurologic), and can occur even when a diver does not exceed dive table limits Quality Improvement Associated NEMSIS Protocol(s) (eProtocol.01 ) (for additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 9914091 - Injury - Diving Emergencies 9914093 - Injury - Drowning/Near Drowning Key Documentation Elements Mechanism of injury or history suggesting cervical spine injury Submersion time Water temperature Activities leading to drowning Consider a standardized data collection metrics such as the Utstein drowning data reporting elements Performance Measures Recognition and appropriate care of pulmonary/respiratory com plaints NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

Trendelenburg posit ion is sometimes recommended to help trap the air in the dependent right ventricle, and may be useful if a central venous catheter is being used to withdraw the air, but this position may increase cerebral ede ma 4. Monitor vital signs including oxygen saturat ions and cardiac rhythm (if possible) 5. Administer oxygen as appropriate with a target of achieving 94 -98% saturation NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Dive (SCUBA) Injury/Accidents 338 Version 3.0 a. Use positive pressure ventilation ( e.g., CPAP) carefully in patients for whom pulmonary barotrauma is a consideration [ See Airway Management Guideline ] and if signs or symptoms of tension pneumothorax are present perform needle decompression 6. Patients with symptoms suspicious for decompression illness, should be placed on supplemental oxygen regardless of saturations to enhance washout of inert gasses 7. Assess for hypothermia, treat per Hypothermia/Cold Exposure Guideline 8. Consider contacting medical direction and discussing need for hyperbaric treatment and primary transport to facility with hyperbaric oxygen ther apy (HBOT ) capability \u2014 include discussion regarding factors such as submersion time, greatest depth achieved, ascent rate, and gas mi x 9. Establish IV access 10. Fluid bolus as indicated Patient Safety Consideration s 1. If the patient is still in the water, seek safest and most rapid means of removal safe (within your scope of training) while minimizing risk of further injury 2. Seek assistance early for special rescue/extrication and transportation needs 3. Check for multiple patients ( e.g., group dive table calculation error(s) or contaminated dive gases) Notes/Educational Pearl s Key Consideration s 1. Rescue efforts should be coordinated between all responding agencies to ensure that the patient is rapidly accessed and safely removed from the water if diver unable to do so themselves 2. If air medical transport is necessary, the patient should be transported with the cabin pressurized to lowest possible altitude. If an unpressurized aircraft is used ( i.e., most helicopter emergency medical services (HEMS) ), patient should be flown at the lowest safe altitude possible 3. Decompression illness may have a variety of presentations depending on system affected (e.g., skin, joint(s), pulmonary, neurologic) 4. SCUBA accidents/incidents can result in a variety of issues, including barotrauma, air embolism and decompression illness 5. Decomp ression illness may have a variety of presentations depending on system affected (e.g., skin, joint(s), pulmonary, neurologic), and can occur even when a diver does not exceed dive table limits 6. Do not attempt to disassemble, turn off, or modify any of the dive equipment. The dive computer may provide a clue about the patient's exposure to depth Pertinent Assessment Findings 1.

March 2022 Altitude Illness 341 Version 3.0 Altitude Illness Aliases Acute mountain sickness (AMS) Altitude sickness High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) Definitions 1. Acute mountain sickness: Headache plus one or more of the following: anorexia, nausea or vomiting, fatigue or weakness, dizziness or lightheadedness or difficulty sleeping. ( In infants and young children, symptoms include pallor, fussiness, vomiting, decreased appetite, poor sleep, decreased playfulness.) These symptoms must occur in the setting of recent arrival to high altitude (generally considered greater than 5000 - 7000 feet) 2. High altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE): Progressive dyspnea, cough, hypoxia, and weakness in high altitude environments (considered greater than 8000 feet). (In infants and young children, symptoms again include pallor, fussiness, vomiting, decreased appetite, poor sleep, decreased playfulness.) Patients may or may not exhibit new symptoms if acute mountain sickness precedes symptoms of HAPE 3. High altitude cerebral edema (HACE) : Heralded by mental status changes in patients with symptoms of acute mountain sickness including altered mentation, ataxia, or stupor and progressing to coma. Typically seen in high altitude environments (greater than 8000 feet) 4. Feet to meters conversion reference: I Patient Care Goal s 1. Improve oxygenation through a combination of descent and supplemental O2 2. Safe but rapid transport from the high -altitude environment to a lower altitude environment Patient Presentatio n Inclusion Criteria 1. Patients suffering from altitude illness, including a. Acute mountain sickness b. High altitude pulmonary edema c. High altitude cerebral edema Exclusion Criteria When protocol is inapplicable . Feet Meters 8000 ft Approximately 2400 m 7000 ft Approximately 2100 m 5000 ft Approximately 1500 m 1000 ft Approximately 300 m 500 ft Approximately 150 m NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Altitude Illness 342 Version 3.0 Patient Managemen t Assessment Assessment should target the signs and symptoms of altitude illness but should also consider alternate causes of these symptoms Treatment and Interventions 1. Ensure scene safety for rescuers 2. Stop ascent a. Patients with acute mountain sickness only may remain at their current altitude and initiate symptomatic therapy b. Patients with HACE or HAPE should initiate descent 3. Perform ABC s (Airway, Breathing, Circulation) and manage airway as necessary 4. Administer supplemental oxygen, if available, with goal to keep oxygen saturations 90% 5. Descend to lower altitude. Descent is the mainstay of therapy and is the definitive therapy for all altitude related illnesses. Descent should be initiated as soon as scene conditions permit a. If severe respiratory distress is present and pulmonary edema is found on exam, clinician should start positive pressure ventilation b. Establish IV and perform fluid bolus with goal to maintain systolic BP greater than 90 mmHg c. Monitor cardiac rhythm 6. Descent should always be the primary treatment strategy for patients suffering from altitude illness, especially patients suffering from HACE and HAPE. If decent is not possible, or if medical direction permits, the EMS clinician may consider the following possible therapies \u2014 portable hyperbaric chambers are effe ctive for the management of severe altitude illness . However, they should not be used in lieu of decent, only as an alternative should descent be unfeasible. a. Acute mountain sickness i. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pai n [See Pain Management Guideline ] ii. Ondansetron 4 mg IV, PO, or sublingual every 6 hours for vomiting [See Nausea - Vomiting Guideline ] iii. Acetazolamide : up to 250 mg PO twice a day 1. Pediatric dosing is 2.5 mg/kg to a maximum of 125 mg, given twice a day 2. Acetazolamide speeds acclimatization and therefore helps in treating acute mountain sickness iv. Dexamethasone 4 mg IM, IV, or PO q 6 hours until symptoms resolve 1. Pediatric dosing is 0.15 mg/kg IM, IV, or PO q 6 hour s; m aximum single dose is 4 mg. 2. Dexamethasone helps treat the symptoms of acute mountain sickness and may be used as an adjunctive therapy in severe acute mountain sickness when the above measures alone do not ame liorate the symptoms. In these circumstances, patients should also initiate descent , as dexamethasone does not facilitate acclimatization b. HACE : All therapies listed below should be considered as adjunctive to descent . Descent should always be the primary t reatment modality i. Dexamethasone : 8 mg IM, IV, or PO once followed by 4 mg q 6 hours 1. Pediatric dosing: 0.15 mg/kg/dose every 6 hours NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Altitude Illness 343 Version 3.0 2. Dexamethasone helps treat the symptoms of HACE and should be initiated in HACE . In these circumstances, patients should also initiate descent ii. Consider use of acetazolamide at the above dosing c. HAPE : All therapies listed below should be considered as adjunctive to descent. Descent should always be the primary treatment modality i. Nifedip ine: Adult 30 mg ER (extended -release) PO twice a day. Pediatric: 0.5 mg/kg (max single dose 20 mg), extended -release PO every 8 hours ii. If nifedipine is not available: iii. Tadalafil : 10 mg PO twice daily may be used OR i. Sildenafil : 50 mg PO three times a day may be used ii. Multiple pulmonary vasodilators should not be used concurrentl y Patient Safety Considerations 1. The high -altitude environment is inherently dangerous. Rescuers must balance patient needs with patient safety and safety for the responders 2. Rapid descent by a minimum of 500 -1000 feet is a priority, however rapidity of descent must be balanced by current environmental conditions and other safety considerations Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Patients suff ering from altitude illness have exposed themselves to a dangerous environment. By entering the same environment, clinician s are exposing themselves to the same altitude exposure. Be vigilant in looking for symptoms of altitude illness amongst rescuers 2. Descent of 500 -1000 feet is often enough to see improvements in patient conditions 3. Patients with HAPE are suffering from non -cardiogenic pulmonary edema and may benefit from positive pressure ventilation via either bag assisted ventilation, CPAP, or other mea ns of positive pressure ventilation 4. Patients suffering from altitude illness are commonly dehydrated and require IV fluids \u2014 once resuscitation is complete and the patient requires no further fluid boluses, maintain IV fluids at 125 mL/hr 5. HAPE is the most lethal of all altitude illnesse s 6. Consider alternate causes of symptoms of AMS \u2014 the symptoms of AMS may be caused by alterna te etiologies such as carbon monoxide poisoning (in patients cooking within enclosed areas), dehydration, exhaustion, hypoglycemia, hyponatremia 7. Children with the following are at greater risk for altitude illness: a. Those with a concurrent upper or lower r espiratory tract infection or otitis media. b. Full term infants less than 6 weeks of age, or preterm infants less than 46 weeks post conceptual age c. Congenital heart disease d. Down syndrome, especially those with obstructive sleep apnea e. Those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, severe scoliosis, and neuromuscular diseases f. Premature infants beyond 46 -weeks with a history of oxygen requirement, PBD or pulmonary hypertension NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Altitude Illness 344 Version 3.0 g. Children who live at high a ltitude when they descend to lower altitude, then return home are at risk for HAPE Pertinent Assessment Findings 1. Consider airway management needs in the patient with severe alteration in mental status 2. HAPE will present with increasing respiratory distress and rales on exam 3.

Manage the condition that triggered the application of the conducted electrical weapon with special attention to patients meeting criterion for delirium wi th agitated behavior [See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline ] 2. Ensure patient is appropriately secured or restrained with assistance of law enforcement to protect the patient and clinicians [ See Agitated or Violent Patient/Behavioral Emergency Guideline ] 3. Perform comprehensive trauma and medical assessment for injuries (e.g., from falls or altercations or concomitant medical issues) 4. If discharged from a distance, up to two single barbed darts (13 mm length) should be located a. Do not remove barbed dart from sensitive areas (head, neck, hands , feet, or genitals) Patient Presentat ion Inclusion Criteria 1. Patient received either a weapon's direct -contact discharge or struck by the barbed dart of a conducted electrical weapon 2. Patient may have sustained fall or physical confrontation trauma 3. Patient may be under the influence of toxic substances and or may have underlying medical or psychiatric disorder Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Managemen t Assessment 1. Once patient has been appropriately secured or restrained with assistance of law enforcement, perform primary and secondary assessment including 3 -lead EKG, pulse oximeter, an d consider 12 -lead EKG 2. Evaluate patient for evidence of delirium with agitated behavior manifested by varied combination of agitation, reduced pain sensitivity, elevated temperature, persistent struggling, or hallucinosis Treatment and Intervention s 1. Make sure patient is appropriately secured with assistance of law enforcement to protect the patient and staff. Consider psychologic management medications if patient struggling against physical devices and may harm themselves or others 2. Some EMS agencies treat all barbed darts as a foreign body and leave them for physician removal while others allow EMS or law enforcement to remove barbed darts except for NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

Follow local protocols, including those of law enforcement for evidence collection and retention. 3. Treat medical and traumatic injury Patient Safety Consideration s 1. Before removal of the barbed dart, make sure the cartridge has been removed from the conducted electrical weapon 2. Patient shou ld not be restrained in the prone, face down, or hog -tied position as respiratory compromise is a significant risk 3. The patient may have underlying pathology before being tased (refer to appropriate guidelines for managing the underlying medical/traumatic p athology) 4. Perform a comprehensive assessment with special attention looking for signs and symptoms of active medical decompensation 5. Transport the patient to the hospital 6. EMS clinician s who respond for a conducted electrical weapon patient should not perform a \"medical clearance\" for law enforcement to then take the patient to a nonmedical facility Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Conducted electrical weapon can be discharged in three fashions: a. Direct contact without the use of the darts b. A single dart with addition contact by direct contact of weapon c. From a distance up to 35 feet with two darts 2. The device delivers 19 pulses per second with an average current per pulse of 2 .1 milliamps which, in combination with toxins/drugs, patient 's under lying diseases, excessive physical exertion, and trauma, may precipitate arrhythmias. Thus, consider cardiac monitoring and 12 -lead EKG assessment 3. Drive Stun is a direct weapon two -point contact which is designed to generate pain and not incapacitate the s ubject. Only local muscle groups are stimulated with the Drive Stun techniq ue Pertinent Assessment Findings 1.

Identify life threatening issues such as dysrhythmias and cardiac arrest 3. Identify characteristics of electrical source to communicate to receiving facility (voltage, amperage, alternating current [AC] versus direct current [DC]) 4. Understand that deep tissue injury can be far greater than external appearance 5. Have high index of suspicion for associated trauma due to patient being thrown 6. Determine most appropriate disposition for the patient as many will require burn center care and some may require trauma center care Patient Presentatio n Inclusion Criteria Exposure to electrical current (AC or DC). Exclusion Criteria None noted Patient Managemen t Assessment 1. Verify scene is secure. The electrical source must be disabled prior to assessment 2. Perform primary survey with specific focus on dysrhythmias or cardiac arrest \u2014apply a continuous cardiac monitor and obtain 12 -lead EKG as soon as feasible 3. Identify all sites of burn injury . If the pati ent became part of the circuit, there will be an additional site near the contact with ground . Electrical burns are often full thickness and involve significant deep tissue damage, and there may be multiple burn sites 4. Assess for potential associated trauma and note if the patient was thrown from contact point . If patient has altered mental status, assume trauma was involved and treat accordingly 5. Assess for potential compartment syndrome from significant extremity tissue damage 6. Determine characteristics of s ource if possible (AC or DC, voltage, amperage, time of injury ) Treatment and Intervention s 1. Identify dysrhythmias or cardiac arrest \u2014 even patients who appear dead (particularly dilated pupils) may have good outcomes with prompt intervention [see appropriate guideline for additional information and patient assessment/treatment] 2. Apply spinal motion restriction if associated trauma suspec ted [ See Trauma Section ] 3. Apply dry dressing to any wounds 4. Remove constricting clothing and jewelry since additional swelling is possible 5. Administer IV fluid resuscitation . Remember that external appearance will underestimate the degree of tissue injury but that electrical injuries do not generally require as much fluid as thermal burn injuries NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev. March 2022 Electrical Injuries 349 Version 3.0 6. Electrical injuries may be associated with significant pain, treat per Pain Management Guideline 7. Electrical injury patients should be taken to a burn center whenever possible since these injuries can involve considerable tissue damage 8. When there is significant associated trauma, this takes priority, if local trauma resources and burn resources are not in the same facility Patient Safety Consideratio ns 1. Verify no additional threat to patient 2. Shut off electrical power 3. Move patient to shelter if electrical storm activity still in area Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Electrical current causes injury through three main mechanisms : a. Direct tissue damage, altering cell membrane resting potential, and eliciting tetany in skeletal and/or cardiac muscles b. Conversion of electrical energy into thermal energy, causing massive tissue destruction and coagulative necrosis c. Mechanical injury with direct trauma resulting from falls or violent muscle contraction 2. Anticipate atrial and/or ventricular dysrhythmias as well as cardiac arrest 3. The mortality related to electrical injuries is impacted by several factors: a. Route current takes through the body - current traversing the heart has higher mortality b. Type of current (AC vs . DC) i. AC is more likely to cause cardiac dysrhythmias while DC is more likely to cause deep tissue burns however either type of current can cause any injury ii. DC typically causes one muscle contraction while AC can cause repeated contracti ons iii. Both types of current can cause involuntary muscle contractions that do not allow the victim to let go of the electrical sourc e iv. AC is more likely to cause ventricular fibrillation while DC is more likely to cause asysto le c. The amount of current impacts mortality more than the voltag e NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guideline s ________________________ Go To TOC Toxins and Environmental Rev.

Should not be used as a solitary, independent sign of death for the purpose of discontinuing resuscitation in this patient populat ion Treatment and Intervention s 1. Assure patent airway \u2014 if in respiratory arrest only, manage airway as appropriate 2. If in cardiopulmonary arrest, treat per Cardiac Arrest Guideline 3. Consider IV initiation \u2014 avoid initiat ion through burned skin 4. Monitor EKG. Be alert for potential arrhythmias. Consider 12 -lead EKG, when available 5. Consider early pain management for burns or associated traumatic injury [ See Pain Management Guideline ] Patie nt Safety Consideration s 1. Recognize that repeat strike is a risk. Patient and rescuer safety is paramount 2. Victims do not carry or discharge a current, so the patient is safe to touch and treat Notes/Educational Pearls Key Considerations 1. Lightning strike cardiopulmonary arrest patients have a high rate of successful resuscitation, if initiated early, in contrast to general cardiac arrest statistics 2. There may be multiple victims 3. If multiple victims, cardiac arrest patients whose injury was witnessed or thought to be recent should be treated first and aggressively (reverse from traditional triage practices) a. Patients suffering cardiac arrest from lightning strike initially suffer a combined cardiac and respiratory arrest b. Return of spontaneous circulation may precede resolution of respiratory arrest c. Patients may be successfully resuscitated if provided proper cardiac and respiratory support, highlighting the value of \"reverse triage\" 4. It may not be immediately apparent that the patient is a light ning strike victim 5. Injury pattern and secondary physical exam findings may be key in identifying patient as a victim of lightning strike 6.

Support continuity of patient care and continuous performance improvement (CPI) of patient care through meeting minimum documentation standards for all EMS events where a patient was encountered 2. This guideline defines minimum standards and inclusions used and referenced throughout this document under the \"Quality Improvement\" section of each guideline 3. The National EMS Infor mation System (NEMSIS) submission requirements, state and local EMS systems, and EMS billing reimbursement services will have more extensive minimum requirements tha t exceed this guideline (For additional information, go to www.nemsis.org ) 4. This guideline can be used as a starting point for systems looking to more formally define documentation requirements Patient Presentation Inclusion Criteria All EMS events where a patient was encountered, and one or more clinical guideline was used to determine patient treatment and/or disposition. Exclusion Criteria None noted Toolkit for Key Categories of Data Elements Incident Demographics 1. Incident Demographics include the type of incident, location, t ime, dispatch information, response resources and patient/incident disposition of the EMS event a. This information will always apply and be available, even if the responding unit never arrives on scene (is cancelled) or never makes patient contact b.

Intended by NEMSIS to be the destination facility or the Agency transferred to, although many ePCR systems only collect this as the destination facility because of the complexity of mixing facilities and services in the same field Assessments and Exams 1. Exams By definition, use of NEMSIS eExam fields is optional; they are, however, available for both state and local EMS system use. a. Many systems do not require use of these fields as they can be time -consuming to enter, often too detailed ( i.e., there is no value for whole arm, it would need to be NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC APPENDICES Rev. March 2022 II. Universal Documentation Guideline 367 Version 3.0 entered as shoulder, upp er arm, elbow, forearm and wrist with separate exam findings for each component, meaning a single exam finding of paralysis for an arm would take ten steps to enter) and the same information is often reflected in the clinician 's narrative. b. However, there is some utility in targeted use of these fields for certain situations such as stroke, spinal exams, and trauma without needing to enter all the fields in each record. 2. Capacity Assessment Group This can be used to support documentation of patient capacity f or refusal of care and/or transport, participation in advanced spinal assessments, or support for treatment decisions by EMS clinician s. NOTE: The Capacity Assessment Group does not provide a legal definition of capacity and should not be used as such. It is intended only to assist the EMS clinician in documenting the most basic exam and history findings in order to determine capacity. Many additional factors must be considered when determining capacity including the situation, patient medical history, medical conditions, and consultation with medical direction . a.

Trauma/Injury NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC APPENDICES Rev. March 2022 II. Universal Documentation Guideline 368 Version 3.0 The exam fields have many useful values for documenting trauma (deformity, bleeding, burns, etc.). Use of targeted documentation of injured areas can be helpful, particularly in cases of more serious trauma. Because of the endless possible variations where this could be used, specific fields will not be defined here. Note, however that the exam fields use a specific and useful Pertinent Negative called \"Exam Findin g Not Present.\" This can be used to document that the clinician actually performed the assessment but did not find any injury/abnormality.

It summarizes the incident history and care in a manner that is easily digested between caregivers for continuity of care and provides a place for EMS to document facts that do not fit into fixed data fields [see Narrative Section under Notes/Educational Pearls (below) for more detail ] Notes/Educational Pearls Documenting Signs and Symptoms Versus Clinician Impressions 1. Signs and Symptoms a. Signs and Symptoms should support the clinician impressions, treatment guidelines and overall care given. A symptom is something the patient experiences and tells the clinician ; it is subjective. A sign is something the clinician sees; it is objective. b. Symptoms should not be confused with clinician impressions. The clinician impressions are the EMS working field diagnosis of the patient's actual medical condition. 2. Clinician Impressions a. There is often a great deal of confusion on t he part of EMS clinician s about the difference between symptoms and clinician impressions. Clinician impressions should be supported by symptoms but not be the symptoms except on rare occasions where they may be the same ( i.e., weakness when no etiology fo r the weakness can be determined by the EMS clinician ). b. Correctly documenting impressions is essential to many aspects of EMS data use, such as EMS reimbursement, reports of incident types, specialty registries ( e.g., CARES) and CPI reviews. EMS agencies could literally lose money or equipment and staffing resources if the clinician s are incorrectly entering clinician impressions. Addressing this issue should be an essential part of the record Quality Assurance and CPI process and documentation training. c. Example of documenting symptoms versus impressions: i. An opiate overdose patient who received naloxone and had a positive response. This patient would have possible Symptoms of altered mental status, unconscious, respiratory distress, and respiratory failur e/apnea. All 4 of these symptoms are available as clinician impressions, however the correct impression for this patient would be whatever variation of \"Drug Overdose Opiates or Heroin\" impression(s) are setup in the local ePCR system being used. This impr ession will specifically define the call as an overdose with opiates, rather than a case where one of the symptoms was also used as an impression when the use of naloxone and other NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC APPENDICES Rev. March 2022 II. Universal Documentation Guideline 371 Version 3.0 assessments and diagnostic tools could not determine an etiology for the symptom(s). Narrative The various data fields within the ePCR are important as they provide a means of uniformly entering incident data that can be used for importing into billing software or hospital records, transmitting between EMS systems or creating de scriptive reports, or conducting research. In most cases, at a local, state, or national level, if something wasn't documented in the appropriate data field, it didn't happen or exist. However, the Narrative plays several essential roles in the PCR. 1. Role of the Narrative a. Provides an efficient and effective means to share patient information for continuity of care between EMS services and EMS and hospital staff. The narrative summarizes the incident history and care in a manner that is easily digested between caregivers. b. Provides a place for EMS to document facts that do not fit into fixed data fields. Specifically, this would include the detailed history of the scene, what the patient may have done or said or other aspects of thecal that only the clinician saw, heard, or did. The Narrative is the place for the EMS clinician to \"paint the picture\" for all others to more fully understand the incident. c. Provides a standard means to add essential details about medical history, exams, treatments, patient res ponse, and changes in patient condition that can't otherwise be effectively or clearly communicated. 2. Narrative Formats Documentation by EMS clinician s demonstrates a wide variation of training and practice reinforcement. Most training programs provide limited instruction on how to properly document operational and clinical processes, and almost no practice. Most clinician s learn this skill on the job, and often proficient mentors are sparse. Therefore, it is essential that the EMS clinician uses a standard format to ensure they are consistent and complete in their documentation. There are three standard formats for EMS documentation. EMS clinician s shou ld choose the best match for them, master the format, and be consistent in its use. a. Medical Narrative: This format is the one most new EMS clinician s use as it is intuitive and easy to learn. Some more experienced clinician s use it as they find telling the story from start to finish works best to organize their thoughts. A drawback to this method is that it is easy to forget to include facts because of the lack of structure. b. SOAP: This format stands for Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan. This is a fo rmat that is very common in the medical field. c. CHART : This format stands for Complaint, History, Assessment, Rx (Treatment) and Transport. Each section's content is clearly defined and consistent in format. It minimizes the likelihood of forgetting informa tion and ensures documentation is consistent between records and clinician s. CHART is the format most recommended as best practice by EMS legal authorities and is considered the standard in many EMS systems. A variation is DCHART, where the \"D\" stands for Dispatch (reason). Medications Given Showing Positive Action Using Pertinent Negatives For medications that are required by protocol ( i.e., aspirin for cardiac chest pain), pertinent negatives should be used to show that a medication protocol was considered but was satisfied by other than clinician action. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC APPENDICES Rev. March 2022 II. Universal Documentation Guideline 372 Version 3.0 Example: EMS is called to a patient for cardiac chest pain. The patient has already taken 324 mg of aspirin by the time EMS arrives per 911 pre-arrival instructions. EMS clinician s should document this as a medication given, prior -to-arrival, with the best estimated time, and qualify the medication as \"Medication Already Taken\" using the pertinent negative. Definitions for Response to Medica tions 1. Improved : a. The medication had its intended therapeutic effect and the patient's symptoms decreased or clinical condition improved or resolved (the word \"effective\" could generally be substituted for \"improved\"). b. If a patient had the intended therapeu tic response to the medication, but a side effect that caused a clinical deterioration in another body system, then \"Improved\" should be chosen and the side effects documented as a complication ( i.e., nitroglycerin improved chest pain but dropped the blood pressure). 2. Unchanged : a. The medication was ineffective and had no intended therapeutic effect or had a sub - therapeutic and unnoticeable effect, AND b. The patient condition did not deteriorate. 3. Worse : a. The patient condition deteriorated or continued to deteriorate because either the medication: i. Was ineffective and had no intended therapeutic effect; OR ii. Had a sub -therapeutic effect that was unable to stop or reverse the decline in patient condition; OR iii. Was the wrong medication for the clinical situation and the therapeutic effect caused the condition to worsen ( i.e., giving glucose to a patient with hype rglycemia/diabetic ketoacidosis). Definitions for Response to Procedures 1. Not Applicable : The nature of the procedure has no direct expected clinical response ( i.e., patient assessment, 12 -lead EKG acquisition). 2. Improved : a. The procedure performed had the in tended effective outcome and/or the patient's symptoms decreased, or clinical condition improved or resolved ( i.e., defibrillation resolved VF into a perfusing rhythm; intubation controlled the airway and allowed effective management of breathing). b. An effe ctive procedure that caused an improvement in the patient condition may also have resulted in a procedure complication and the complication should be documented (i.e., intubation caused minor airway trauma, but the intubation successfully secured the airwa y). 3. Unchanged : a. The procedure performed did not have the clinical effect intended, but did not directly worsen the patient's symptoms or clinical condition ( i.e., attempted defibrillation and NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC APPENDICES Rev. March 2022 II. Universal Documentation Guideline 373 Version 3.0 the person remained in VF) ; or b. Had a sub-therapeutic effect and the symptoms continued ( i.e., a bandage applied to a bleeding wound failed to stop the bleeding); or c. The nature of the procedure has no direct expected clinical response ( i.e., patient assessment). NOTE: \"Not Applicable\" would also be appropriate to choose for these cases 4. Worse : a. The results of the procedure performed lead to a worsening of the patient's symptoms or condition ( e.g., defibrillation converted VF into asystole, application of a splint caused significant increase in pain or loss of sensation and pulses). b. In the case of worsening condition, documentation of the procedure complications may also be appropriate. c. NOTE: Just because a patient got worse, doesn't necessarily mean the clinician performed the procedure incorrectly. NEMSIS Data Standards and Limitations 1. NEMSIS is a national dataset and standard used by all EMS software systems. (For additional informatio n, go to www.nemsis.org .) Currently there are three versions of the data standard available for documentation and in which data is stored: a. NEMSIS Version 2.2.1 (v2.2.1) i. Adopted in 2006, there have been no changes since release ii. Most states or systems have used this standard since i ts release, and the majority of most states' data available since approximately 2016 is in this format. iii. NEMSIS accepted v2.2.1 data through 12/31/2016, and some states may continue to collect data in this standard until they transition to NEMSIS v3 standar ds. b. NEMSIS Version 3 (v3) i. NEMSIS v3 was created and finalized in 2011 to replace v2.2.1 in order to allow the dataset to become more flexible for updates and adopt technical standards making linkage to other health records possible. 1. NEMSIS v3.3.4 was relea sed in March 2014 and was the first version in production where live data was collected by services and states and subsequently submitted to NEMSIS. NEMSIS will continue to accept v3.3.4 data until 12/31/2017. 2. NEMSIS v3.4, released in March 2015, included both changed elements and many added values to existing elements. NEMSIS has been accepting data from this version concurrently with V3.3.4 data. As of August 2021 , v3.4 will be the only standard and V3.3.4 will be phased out. All documentation guidelines found in this document are based on the NEMSIS v3.4 dataset and standard. 2. Mandatory and Required Elements b. Mandatory: NEMSIS makes certain elements or fields mandatory so, if not included, the record cannot be properly stored or moved electronically. These fields require real data and do not accept Nil (Blank) values, Not Values, or Pertinent Negatives. c. Required: NEMSIS requires these elements or fields to be completed or the record cannot be properly stored or moved electronically. However, required fields allow Nil (blank) values, Not Values, or Pertinent Negatives to be entered and submitted. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC APPENDICES Rev. March 2022 II. Universal Documentation Guideline 374 Version 3.0 d. State and local systems may have Mandatory or Required fields that are not Mandatory or Required by NEMSIS. The manager for these systems should be contacted for a li st of these fields. 3. Not Values, Nil, and Pertinent Negatives b. Not Values (NV), Nil, and Pertinent Negatives (PN) are values that are attributes of certain NEMSIS elements designed to clarify a null data entry or qualify data entry into the element with whic h the NV, Nil, or PN is associated. c. Not Values available are \"Not Applicable\" and \"Not Recorded\" i. Some NEMSIS rules require one of these values to be entered when data is imported/exported if there is no other data in a field ( e.g., at least one medication given must have a value, if no medications are given, then the software system must insert \"Not Applicable\" in the medications field when exporting) ii. At times the EMS clinician use of \"Not Applicable\" is appropriate documentation (e.g., using \"Not Applicable\" under eInjury.03 \u2014Trauma Center Criteria , per the ACS - COT 2022 National Guideline for the Field Triage of Injured Patients , when transporting a patient with a simple sprained ankle) d. Nil Values are blank values i. Values can be lef t blank, which can either be an accidental or purposeful omission of data. ii. Value fields can appropriately and purposefully be left blank if there was nothing to enter ( e.g., a procedure field left blank if no patient was encountered). e. Pertinent Negatives are attributes or qualifiers for both elements and fields. There are 11 possible Pertinent Negative values and the available list for each field varies as appropriate to the field. Two examples of the use of Pertinent Negatives are: i. Documenting non -administration of ASA for chest pain by the EMS clinician with the Pertinent Negative of \"Medication Already Taken\" to show evidence that this treatment requirement was met. ii. Docume nting assessment of, and lack of a gunshot wound to the chest with the qualifier of \"Chest --> gunshot wound --> Exam Finding Not Present\" in the examination section (previously you could only document a positive finding of a gunshot wound with was no way to document that you looked and did not find one). 4. NEMSIS Element and Value Name Formats b. NEMSIS Elements/Fields are organized into groups with other related elements/fields i. There are two parent datasets: Demographic (designated by a \"d\") and EMS (designat ed by an \"e\"). The majority of the documentation in any ePCR falls in the \"e\" section. The Demographic dataset is intended to be descriptive of the EMS agencies and system characteristics for correlation at a larger research level, rather than for use in o perational CPI reviews. ii. The element numbering structure reflects the dataset and the text group name of the element 5. Example: \"eVitals.06 \u2014SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure)\" where \"e\" is the EMS dataset and \"Vitals\" is the dataset grouping for all elements rel ated to Vitals and the number is the number assigned to a specific element. b. \"eVitals.06\" is used to store the data in the background and \"SBP (Systolic Blood Pressure)\" is what clinician s and reviewers see. c. Values are designated by a code and text name. NASEMSO National Model EMS Clinical Guidelines ________________________ Go To TOC APPENDICES Rev. March 2022 II. Universal Documentation Guideline 375 Version 3.0 i. The codes are generally derived from various sources such as ICD -10, SNOMED, or RxNorm and are used to store and move the data in the system's background. ii. Codes are not seen by the EMS clinician in the ePCR, but rather the clinician will see text names. Some software systems allow the visible text name to be modified or relabeled to meet local standards or nomenclature; This feature can help improve data quality by making documentation easier for the clinician . iii. An example of a value code and name for card iac chest pain, found under the element \"eProtocols.01 \u2014Protocols Used\" is \"9914117 - Medical -Cardiac Chest Pain\". d. All minimum general documentation guideline requirements are identified using the NEMSIS element, values codes, and names to allow application across a variety of ePCR software labels for these fields. 6. Custom Elements/Fields and Values b. The NEMSIS Standard provides a data format for software vendors to create custom elements or values requested by states or local systems. c. States or local systems may create new elements or value extensions for existing NEMSIS elements to meet regional needs ( e.g., adding additional protocol name values not on the NEMSIS list). Airway Confirmation Fields Specific use of the NEMSIS airway confirmation fields in documentation will not be detailed at this time due to current operational and technical challenges all states, local systems, and ePCR software vendors are experiencing. The NEMSIS airway confirmation fields were closely modeled on the \"Recommended Gu idelines for Uniform Reporting of Data from Out -of-Hospital Airway Management: Position Statement of the National Association of EMS Physicians\" and the fields and values could provide excellent and appropriately useful data to evaluate airway management. However, the technical structure of the fields has made their practical use limited as all the data is collected as a separate, self - contained group, rather than as part of the procedures group. This means EMS clinician s would need to enter much of the sam e information twice in the ePCR, in both the procedures area and airway confirmation section (when, who did it, what device was used, and complications). Furthermore, the airway group can only be entered once per e PCR, so the fields cannot be used again if more than one airway was required ( e.g., one airway became ineffective and needed to be replaced with a different type of airway). Many states and ePCR software vendors have been struggling with how to make these fields functional for use by only using a portion of them or looking to add mirrored custom values that are directly linked to procedures performed. However, solutions are currently far from practical, functional, effective, or uniform in how they are being implemented or used across vario us systems. References 1.

Burn and Burn Fluid Charts 401 Version 3.0 Parkland Formula For patients who require fluid resuscitation, consider use of the Parkland formula to calculate the volume of normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution that should be administered intravenously to ensure hemodynamic stability. Volume of Intravenous Fluid required in the first 24 hours (in mL) = (4 X patient weight in kg) X (Percentage of total body surface area burned) The first half of the volume of fluid should be administered over the first 8 hours f ollowing the burn with the remaining fluid administered over the following 16 hours. For pediatric patients, a weight -based assessment tool (length -based tape or other system) should be used to provide a more accurate estimate of the patient's weight. Lik ewise, the total body surface area (BSA) estimates are different for pediatric patients compared to adults due to larger head and trunk size. For children, the palmar surface of the hand (not including the fingers is approximately equal to 1% BSA. The guid elines listed above will provide assistance during the estimation of the percentage of total body surface area burned for patients of various ages and body habitus.

Neurologic Status Assessment Neurologic status assessment involves establishing a baseline and then trending any change in patient neurologic status. Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) is frequently used, but there are often errors in applying and calculating this s core. With this in consideration, Glasgow Coma Score may not be more valid than a simpler field approach. Either AVPU (Alert, Verbal, Painful, Unresponsive) or only the motor component of the GCS may more effectively serve in this capacity.

Evidence -Based Guidelines: GRADE Methodology An Overview of GRADE Methodology Although engagement in quality EMS research has increased significantly, the demand for evidence - based quality prehospital research continues to exceed its availability. The need for evidence -based prehospital patient care protocols was clearly recognized by the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies and clearly stated in 2007 in The Future of Emergency Care: Emergency Medical Services at the Crossroads. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology is a transparent process where the available research is reviewed and assessed by a panel of subject matter experts. Following this thorough review process, the available research is reviewed and graded for its validity based upon the assessment of the workg roup, and an evidence - based guideline (EBG) is developed based upon the outcome of the workgroup. The Federal Interagency Committee on Emergency Medical Services (FICEMS) and the National EMS Advisory Council (NEMSAC) approved a National Prehospital Evidence -based Guideline Model Process for the development, implementation, and evaluation of evidence -based guidelines. This Model Process recommends the use of the GRADE methodology for the guideline development tool. The six process steps of the GRADE EBG development tool are: Assemble the expert panel and provide GRADE training Define the EBG content area and establish the specific clinical questions to address in patient, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) format Prioritize outco mes to facilitate systematic literature searches Create GRADE tables (or evidence profiles) for each PICO question Vet and endorse GRADE evidence tables and draft recommendations Synthesize recommendations into an EMS protocol and visual algorithm Some evidence -based guidelines cited in this document were created for and released by NHTSA; however, the GRADE methodology is not proprietary to NHTSA or any other organization. Local, regional, and state EMS agencies and EMS systems are encouraged to support t he ongoing need for quality prehospital care, improved patient outcome, and the growing demand for EBGs for EMS.
