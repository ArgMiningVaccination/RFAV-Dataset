Project 1 builds on a cohort study of pregnant women using private wells with elevated arsenic levels and their children will be evaluated for occurrence of infections, allergies/atopy and vaccine response. Project 2 investigates the contribution of drinking water and diet to early childhood arsenic (As) exposure. Project 3 examinesepigenetic/gene expression changes in the placenta from As exposure and children's health outcomes. Project 1: Childhood immune response and exposure The primary aims of project 1 were to test the hypothesis that in utero and early life arsenic (As) and other exposures are related to increased occurrence of childhood: 1) infections (number, type and severity of infections), in particular respiratory infections, in the first 5 years of life; 2) allergy and atopy in the first 5 years of life; and 3) diminished vaccine response (to Diphtheria/Tetanus/Pertussis, Pneumococcus and Polio) at age one. The secondary aim was to investigate the relation between in utero and early life As exposure on the development of the infant intestinal microbiome in the first year of life (based on stool samples taken at 6 weeks and 12 months of age). We hypothesized that As exposure will be associated with decreased diversity of the microbiome (e.g., based on the Simpson Diversity Index (SDI)), and differences in the relative abundance of specific phylotypes (e.g., bacterial genera and species) and/or predominant gene families or metabolic pathways. Project 2: Water and dietary arsenic exposure related to early growth and neurodevelopment The project aims were to: 1) To estimate arsenic (As) and other exposures from food and water ingestion and to relate these intakes to biomarkers of exposure during the first five years of life, a period of rapidly changing diet for most children; 2) To quantify the association of biomarkers of early life exposures with physical growth patterns during the first five years of life; and 3) To quantify the association of biomarkers of early life exposures with neurodevelopment during the first five years of life. Project 3: Placental biomarkers of exposure and outcome The project aims were to: 1) To identify regions of variable DNA methylation in the placenta associated with in utero exposure to As by examining the methylation status of relevant candidate genes and regions using quantitative bisulfite pyrosequencing and using genome-wide DNA methylation arrays and biomarker-based exposure assessment; 2) To identify altered gene expression in the placenta associated with in utero exposure to As by testing the expression of relevant candidate genes, including those identified in Aim 1, and their association with biomarker-based As exposure; 3) To examine if the As-associated variable DNA methylation and altered gene expression in placenta prospectively relates to child weight growth, infection, and neurodevelopmental outcomes. The Community Outreach and Translation Core (COTC), a central component of the Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center at Dartmouth, seeks to prevent adverse child health outcomes resulting from environmental exposures by facilitating the translation and communication of the Center's research to key stakeholders. The aims remain the same: 1) To oversee the development of resources to effectively disseminate the Center's research findings to key children's health decision makers: parents, medical care providers, local government and policy makers; 2) To effectively communicate well water arsenic test results to pregnant women; 3) To develop primary care practice-based approaches to increase private well testing; 4) To incorporate well water testing recommendations and arsenic information into a regional community health organization's outreach initiative. The original, unaltered aims of Core A were to provide central coordination and oversight for the Center and advance all administrative, communication, regulatory, budgetary, training, mentoring and career development activities, including: 1) Plan, implement and evaluate education, training, mentoring and career development activities of junior investigators and recruitment of new faculty members to the Center; 2) Support the Child Health Specialist and Assistant Health Specialist to create and maintain meaningful interactions to reduce adverse child health outcomes related to environmental exposures and to assure success of this Center; 3) Ensure integration of Center activities and effective use of state-of-the-art institutional resources and shared databases; and 4) Coordinate Center communications, fiscal, compliance, reporting and overall center evaluation and perform administrative functions. Summary/Accomplishments (Outputs/Outcomes): Overall: The researchers of the Center found novel relationships between fetal and maternal exposures to arsenic and susceptibility to infection/allergy, distinct characteristics of the both the placenta and maternal and infant gut microbiota. When infants were exposed to arsenic during pregnancy increased risk of both infant wheezing and infection requiring a physician visit during the first year of life was found. Additional analyses further found that feeding mode (breast versus formula feeding) and delivery type (vaginal versus C-section) have an impact on the infant gut microbiota. Throughout the project, the Center's researchers further advanced the understanding of dietary sources and routes of exposure to arsenic through water, rice and other foods and contributed to several reports on this subject, including the State of New Hampshire's Department of Environmental ServicesReview of the Drinking Water Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) and Ambient Groundwater Quality Standard (AGQS) for Arsenic. The report was instrumental in NH Governor Chris Sununu's decision to sign HB261 to lower the MCL for arsenic in public drinking water systems from 10 parts per billion (ppb) to 5 ppb. With the signing of this bill, NH has become the second state in the nation to lower the MCL for arsenic in public drinking water. The Center's Community Outreach and Translation Core developed a successful partnership with the Dartmouth CO-OP Primary Care Practice Based Research Network and the New Hampshire State Lab to promote water use screening and testing. OurCenter's research and core activities throughout the project period built on the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, an ongoing prospective cohort study in rural New England. To be eligible pregnant women need to be: 1) 18-45 years old, 2) receiving routine prenatal care at one of the study clinics, 3) consuming drinking water at their place of residence from a private well (defined as a well serving fewer than 15 households or 25 individuals), 4) residing in the same place of residence since their last menstrual period, using the same water supply, and not planning to move prior to delivery. Enrollment is limited to singleton pregnancies. The parent cohort study was funded to recruit approximately 2,000 maternal-newborn pairs (NIEHS P42 ES007373: Project PL: Karagas) and obtain information through pregnancy. As part of our Children's Center we expanded the collection and processing of delivery samples ncluding the ongoing collection of placenta tissue (utilized in Project 3), in addition to cord blood and newborn stool. This required strong cooperation of the clinic staff and has proven successful (about 85% of placenta samples, 80% of cord blood and 80% of stool have been obtained). We also began collecting more detailed information about maternal diet including rice intake as a potential source of arsenic and other metals on the three-day diary that accompanies the urine collection (utilized in Project 2). We extended our medical record abstraction to include maternal infection during pregnancy, maternal infections at delivery, and newborn infections (utilized in Project 1). Our Children's Center allows us to follow children in our cohort and to collect, process and archive samples from them. To obtain allergy, atopy and infection information, we re-contact caregivers every four months in the child's first year, biannually in the second year and annually thereafter to ask about their child's recent infant infections, including acute respiratory infections, gastrointestinal symptoms and fever (see Project 1). Questions regarding atopic disorders (i.e., food or aeroallergies and eczema) are also included in this assessment. The interval questionnaire further includes questions about general dietary patterns (breast versus formula feeding), changes in water supply, and daycare attendance. Pediatric medical records reviews are done to update the child's growth, diagnoses, medications and vaccination history (see Projects 1 and 2 descriptions below). As of June 2019, we have screened 12,220 women at 12-16 weeks gestation, of whom 2,855 were potentially eligible. Over 2,105 women were enrolled at the 24-28 week visit (an approximately 75% response rate). Over 8,958 prenatal samples already have been collected, processed and aliquoted (e.g., water, maternal urine, hair, and toenails) as well as over 13,353 delivery/postpartum samples (cord blood, meconium, placenta biopsies, infant and maternal toenails). Additionally, information has been abstracted from prenatal medical records, maternal and infant delivery medical records. To date, over 9,405 interval telephone interviews have been completed. Of the first ~2,000 water samples tested, arsenic concentrations ranged from < 1ug/L to nearly 200 ug/L, with roughly 10% of the samples exceeding the MCL of 10 ug/L. Maternal urinary arsenic concentrations ranged from <1 ug/L to close to 300 ug/L. Thus, we have successfully established a complex and rich epidemiologic resource for investigating early life exposures and their subsequent health consequences. Our Center's work has helped risk assessors, regulators, policy makers, caregivers, and other stakeholders to implement immediate and long-term strategies to prevent environmentally-induced diseases in children. Results from our Center were highlighted in the NIEHS/EPA Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers Impact Report, progress reports and interim updates. Within the project period, none of the projects or cores of our center have encountered any problems, adverse conditions, delays, or changed the scope or mission of our center, cores or projects. We have not experienced any changes in key personnel or Center management, nor did experience any costs which were higher or lower than originally estimated in our proposal. Our Center's standard operating procedures for data collection, laboratory operation, and other quality assurance procedures for key aspects of the Center's project research are well established and in place for all projects. Summary of Findings fromProject 1: Prospectively collected data on clinical markers of immunity function, including childhood infections, allergy and atopy up to age 5 years, blood at age one for antibodies to infant vaccinations, and repeated stool samples to characterize the developing gut microbiome. We have related these outcomes with multiple routes of As exposure (i.e., via water, food) using biomarker measurements (i.e., during pregnancy and early childhood via urine and toenails) in collaboration with Project 2, and biologic, mechanistic changes (e.g., placental epigenetics, gene expression profiles) in collaboration with Project 3. We completed our analyses of the relationship between in utero arsenic exposure and an increased risk of both infant wheezing and infection requiring a physician visit during the first year of life. We furthered our collaborative work on dietary exposure to arsenic reporting rice and rice product consumption as a common route of exposure in the first year of life. We also completed our analysis of pre- and post-natal arsenic exposure in relation to the infant 6-week gut microbiome. Additionally, preliminary analyses of untargeted metabolomics data from infant stool samples in collaboration with the NIH Eastern Regional Comprehensive Metabolomics Resource Core (obtained through PA-15-030) revealed distinct clustering by feeding mode (breast versus formula feeding) and delivery type (vaginal versus C-section). Analysis of arsenic exposure in relation to fetal metabolomic profiles as a reflection of the function of microbes present in the infant gut is being conducted. Major Activities. Throughout the project period, our project built off the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, a longitudinal study of over 2,000 maternal-infant pairs that has collected a wealth of data. These include: maternal health, diet and lifestyle factors, samples of household tap water, maternal blood, urine and toenails (at 24-28 weeks gestation), cord blood and placenta, infant meconium, nails, urine and stool, and maternal toenails at 2 weeks postpartum. Additionally, we have conducted a structured review of prenatal and delivery records. During the formative phase of our project, we began collecting more detailed information on maternal and newborn infections and allergies through a review of the medical records, and initiated an interval telephone interview for updated infection allergy/atopy information from the child's caregiver over the first year of life. As part of our full Center's project, after refining our protocols and study instruments, we continue this follow-up\u2014both through a review of pediatric records in collaboration with Project 2, and the interval telephone interviews at 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 50 months. Through a R21 grant in collaboration with Dr. Kari Nadeau of the Berkeley/Stanford Children's Center, we conducted a pilot study to establish a protocol for collecting blood samples from our cohort members at one year of age to test for vaccine response. Another focus of our work was to investigate novel biomarkers of immune function and response. This included microbiome analysis of infant stool samples beginning at birth and through the first year of life. Specific Objectives. Infectious diseases remain the leading cause of illness in children in the US, and of mortality in children worldwide. Additionally, the prevalence of allergy and atopic diseases have become more widespread among children in recent years, for reasons that are not fully understood. Therefore, our objectives are to assess the relation of environmentally relevant levels of As (and other exposures) with clinical and biologic measures of early childhood immune function (e.g., infection/allergy/atopy, vaccine response and intestinal microbial acquisition). To achieve our objectives, we leveraged an ongoing US prospective study of women and infants enrolled during pregnancy who are residents of New Hampshire and who obtain household water from private wells, a potential source of arsenic exposure in the region. Understanding whether common levels of exposure during the vulnerable periods of fetal development and early childhood impact immune response have widespread implications for public health and practice change. Significant Findings.We completed analyses of the first year of life of infants in the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study, including on the relationship betweenin uteroarsenic exposure and an increased risk of both infant wheezing and infection requiring a physician visit or a prescription medicine. We furthered our collaborative work on dietary exposure to arsenic reporting rice and rice product consumption as well as other solid foods as routes of exposure for infants transitioning to solid food (Signes-Pastor et al., 2018). We also completed our analysis of pre- and post-natal arsenic exposure in relation to the infant 6 week gut microbiome (Hoen et al., 2018). Key Outcomes and Other Achievements. Project 1's wealth of resources grew with data collected through our interval surveys and collected biological samples. These resources allowed us to further explore the role of dietary exposures, incidence of infection and possible mediating effects of the maternal and infant microbiota on maternal and infant health in the perinatal period and early childhood. Throughout the project period, we engaged physicians in this research to promote and expedite translation of our findings to the clinical setting and community. We also collaborated with a pilot study on exposure to arsenic via seaweeds (Taylor et al, 2017) and explored untargeted metabolomics data from infant stool samples to examine possible differences in in the infant microbiome due to feeding mode (breastfeeding versus formula feeding), delivery type (vaginal versus C-section) and metal exposure. Summary of Findings from Project 2: Project 2 completed extensive data collection, with data analysis and synthesis underway. For aim 1, assessment of dietary exposure to arsenic during the first year of life continued using the approaches previously developed in the P20 phase and new approaches were piloted and introduced at ages 3 and 5. We collected a food-frequency questionnaire and toenail samples from over 700 three-year oldsand a food frequency questionnaire, recent dietary history, and urine sample from over 500 five-year olds. For Aim 2, we assessed physical growth of children ages birth\u20145 years using medical record reviews (in collaboration with Project 1) and performed in-person growth assessments on over 500 children 5 years of age. For Aim 3, we performed neurodevelopmental assessments using mailed standardized behavioral assessments for more than 700 children at age 3 (the Social Responsive Scale, 2ndedition [SRS-2] and the Behavior Assessment System for Children, 2nd edition [BASC-2]) and more detailed, in-person assessments of over 500 children at age 5 years (the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 4th edition [WPPSI-IV], the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, 2nd edition [BOT-2], and parent completed BASC-2 and SRS-2 instruments). Our findings have made important contributions to understanding the impact of diet, particularly during infancy and early childhood, on the risk of early life exposure to arsenic. These results have been directly applicable to efforts to improve food safety for children. In addition, we are finding potential associations between early life arsenic exposures and some of our health outcomes. Confirmation and expansion of these findings will be critical to understanding the child health risks of arsenic at the low-level exposures that are prevalent in many populations. Summary of Findings from Project 3: Project 3 has been successful and productive in its analyses focused on epigenetic and gene expression variation in placenta tissue collected from the NHBCS participants and relating that variation both to prenatal exposures and newborn health outcomes. Over the course of the award, we performed genome-wide DNA methylation profiling on nearly 350 placenta samples using the Illumina 450K array, as well as gene expression assays utilizing Nanostring, and targeted DNA methylation studies using pyrosequencing. Additionally, through Dr. Marsit's (project leader) independent funding, companion data from his Rhode Island Child Health Study has become available in parallel to the NHBCS, allowing for increased rigor in our analyses through meta-analytic and replication approaches. The planned laboratory assays and analyses have been completed, and the data created through this research has been made available through the NCBI GEO archive (Accession: GSE71678.) Major Activities.In the original project application, we proposed to examine a panel of candidate genes for their DNA methylation status and their expression, and we have worked to design, validate, and implement pyrosequencing assays and a nanostring panel for a number of these genes. We also proposed and have undertaken genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation using selected samples from the New Hampshire cohort, and have completed a series of analyses on the resulting data. Specific Objectives. This project is compelled by the hypothesis that environmental exposures encountered by a pregnant woman impact the gene expression of the infant's placenta via epigenetic and other mechanisms and these functional alterations are associated with developmental outcomes in the children. Our objectives are to identify epigenetic and gene expression alterations in the placenta associated with maternal and infant biomarkers ofin uteroarsenic exposure, and to examine how these alterations are associated with critical health outcomes in the first few years of life. To accomplish these objectives, we are utilizing the existing and growing resources of the ongoing New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study and are thus translating key findings from basic research into human populations. Significant Findings.Throughout the course of this project, we have developed the largest dataset of placental genome-scale DNA methylation data and have been able to make use of that data in a variety of analyses to better understand the impact of arsenic and other trace contaminants on the functional epigenome of the placenta. Through these analyses, and making use of Dr. Marsit's RI Child Health Study, we have been able to identify altered placental DNA methylation associated with exposure to arsenic (Green, et al EHP 2016), tobacco smoking (Maccani et al Epigenomics 2013), mercury (Maccani et al, EHP 2015), manganese (Maccani et al, Reprod Toxicol 2015), air pollution (Kingsley et al Envir Int 2016), cadmium (Everson, et al. EHP 2018), occupational circadian disruption (Clarkson-Townsend et al, PLoS One 2018), and copper (Kennedy, et al, Epigenetics 2019). We have also linked altered DNA methylation in the placenta to a variety of early life health outcomes including birth weight and neurobehavioral performance. In addition to this applied research linking exposure to altered placental epigenetic patterning and early life outcomes, Dr. Marsit and his team have made seminal contributions to the methodologies used in the analyses of DNA methylation in human studies, including methods to examine cell composition effects in analyses on tissues, such as placenta, where no reference data sets are available (Houseman et al, BMC Bioinformatics 2016). In additional targeted analyses, Dr. Robbins and his team examined the expression of 29 genes that regulate the signaling pathways that drive early development. These analyses highlighted two genes whose expression is associated with U-As levels. Interestingly, we noted that further stratification based on the sex of the fetus led to the identification of additional genes whose expression was associated with U-As. These results suggested that the expression of a number of the drivers of early human development is modified by arsenic exposure in a sexually dimorphic way. When we extended these findings to the analysis of infant birth weight, we noted that the U-As associated gene,GLI3, was also associated with birth weight in female placentae, suggesting that it may be a key signaling node mediating arsenic's effects on fetal growth (Winterbottom et al, 2015). Along these same lines, examining a panel of epigenetic regulators, which may be important for establishing the patterning of DNA methylation described above, are also altered by exposure to arsenic during development and that this variation is also differential by sex (Winterbottom et al 2019). This provides intriguing evidence to explain the often observed sexual dimorphism in the health effects of arsenic and other toxic exposures. Summary of Findings from the Community Outreach and Translation Core: The Dartmouth COTC has developed relationships and actively engaged with key children's environmental health stakeholders, both regionally and nationally. Regionally, our collaborative relationship with the Dartmouth CO-OP Primary Care Practice Based Research Network provided us with outreach capabilities to 200 clinical sites in New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine serving primarily rural residents, many of whom rely on private water systems for drinking water. We partnered with state health departments in NH and VT to create well water testing information designed for dissemination in clinical settings. We delivered educational presentations to clinicians in this primary care network regarding the public health vulnerability of populations reliant on private unregulated water systems. We completed an intervention study comparing different methods of integrating well water testing promotion into pediatric primary care and continue to facilitate the provision of well water testing kits in regional primary care clinics. The manuscript of this study is currently under review. We continue to provide continuing medical education offerings to clinicians within our region regarding pediatric environmental health issues and sharing results from the NH Birth Cohort Study. Our partnership with our public health stakeholders in NH led to incorporation of arsenic and well water questions into the CDC sponsored PRAMS survey starting in 2013, which is administered annually to a representative sample of women in the state who have recently given birth, and allows for assessment of access to and quality of perinatal health services. We conducted the analyses of these data and are disseminating to NH obstetricians and nurse midwives. The recent legislation that led to NH reducing the MCL for arsenic in public water systems was informed by our Center's research and reflects the partnership we have developed with the NH Dept of Environmental Services. Nationally we have collaborated with the COTC's of other Children's Centers in harnessing social media tools to disseminate key evidence-based information regarding children's environmental health for the public, in particular aiming to target pregnant women and parents. This has included developing platforms and content aligned with health literacy and social media standards. We also developed a web-based interactive infographic tool to explain sources of arsenic and pathways into food and water that has been incorporated into several educational websites. Our national work has also included providing testimony and sharing our Center's research results to policy makers at the FDA, as well as to organizations such as the American Pediatric Association (APA), as well as in national meetings of public health and children's health professionals. The work of the Core has helped risk assessors, regulators, policy makers, clinicians, parents, and other stakeholders to implement immediate and long-term strategies to prevent environmentally-induced diseases in children. Results from our Center were highlighted in the NIEHS/EPA Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers Impact Report. Summary of Findings from the Administrative Core: In the project period the Administrative, Career Development and Research Integration Core has provided support critical to completing the analyses of the Center's research projects and cores. Specifically, the Core has supported a study coordinators and data analyst to perform statistical analyses for the Center investigators. These positions have been critical to the successful completion of data analyses and have expedited and ensured the publication of manuscripts and completion of research and/or training aims and objectives. Throughout the project period the Administrative, Career Development and Research Integration Core has provided support critical to completing the Center's research projects and cores, under the directorship of Dr. Margaret Karagas. Specifically, the Core has provided the support for a programmer/analyst in theInformatics Collaboratory for Design, Development, and Dissemination (ic3d.dartmouth.edu) and has facilitated the coordination and oversight of the state-of-the-art databases and shared resources. This support enabled the transition of the Center's existing data into a more usable data warehouse and ensured its integrity. The data platform provided efficient query, analysis, and reporting by Center investigators. Data entry systems, rigorous data quality checks for the questionnaires and biosamples collected as part of the Center were completed. We provided an application programming interface (API) that allows authorized systems or tools, such as REDCap, label printers, and barcode scanners to access selected system capabilities. Secure access to the database using tools such as R and SAS have been constructed for data analysis files. This support was crucial for Center project and core leaders, and trainees to complete their analyses, and helped to expedited publication of manuscripts and completion of research and/or training aims and objectives. The Core further supported the leadership of the Center to ensure effective administrative oversight through active communication, strategic planning for ongoing sustainability, and compliance with all regulatory and fiscal requirements to support the goals of the Center. The Core provided support to the Center's Child Health Specialist, Dr. John Moeschler, who assured the success of the Center. Throughout the project period, Dr. Moeschler acted as a liaison to the Chair of the Department of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital at Dartmouth Hitchcock Medical Center, to primary pediatric care providers, and leaders in local and regional health communities and agencies. He helped to coordinate translation efforts with other Center health care providers, representing the Center in national committees and organizations involved in health care delivery to children, as well as research, policy and regulation regarding children's environmental health, and participating in the COTC activities. Finally, one of our Center's top priorities was to promote the careers of new investigators, by identifying and fostering the success of talented early career scientists who are motivated to address critical issues in children's health. Our team of early career faculty and mentors was diverse with a high proportion of women and ethnic minorities. In summary, we provided ongoing support for our dynamic Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center including for key Center members including our Faculty Development Investigator, a data manager/analyst, a COTC postdoctoral trainee, and travel to the Annual Meetings of the Children's Program, during the entire project period. This permitted the completion of statistical analyses, scientific presentations and publications of our Center's research on the sources and health impacts of common environmental exposures, such as arsenic and other exposures, on child health and development, and enhance translation of these findings to the public, medical community, regulators and policy makers. Thus, our Children's Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Center contributed to great strides in addressing environmental health issues facing children today and impacting their health throughout life.
