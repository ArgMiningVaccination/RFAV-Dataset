Foster School of Medicine, Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, USA. He received his B.S. from Sichuan University, M.S. from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Ph.D. in Biochemistry from Tel Aviv University, and had postdoctoral training in Molecular and Cell Biology at University of California, Berkeley, and in Immunology and Gene Therapy at University of Alabama School of Medicine, Birmingham. Dr. Zeng has spent the last decade to develop new generation vaccines and molecular therapeutics against respiratory pathogens such as influenza viruses and Streptococcus pneumoniae as well as agents important for biodefense such as Bacillus anthracis, botulinum neurotoxins, and Francisella tularensis. He is also studying the effect of current vaccination programs on the epidemiological changes of respiratory and intestinal pathogens (strain replacement and antigenic variation) and how people respond to infection or vaccination at cellular and molecular levels (T cell, B cell, and gene expression levels). Dr. Zeng has served as members of numerous grant reviewing committees for National Institute of Health (NIH) and Department of Defense (DOD) in the field of infectious diseases and microbial vaccine research. He has been members of editorial board for several journals and reviewed manuscripts for many journals. Research Interest Microbial infection, immunity, and vaccine development. "}
