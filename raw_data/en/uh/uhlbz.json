However, the specific therapeutic strategies or drugs have not been discovered. Vitamin C is a water-soluble antioxidant and is a cofactor in many important biosynthesis pathways. Recently, many researchers have reported that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment had positive effects on various diseases. However, the precise relationship between mega-dose vitamin C and NAFLD has not been completely elucidated. This study has been designed to discover the effects of mega-dose vitamin C on the progression of NAFLD. Twelve-week-old wild-type C57BL6 mice were fed chow diets and high-fat and high-fructose diet (fast-food diet) ad libitum for 11 weeks with or without of vitamin C treatment. Vitamin C was administered in the drinking water (1.5 g/L). In this study, 11 weeks of the mega-dose vitamin C treatment significantly suppressed the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) independently of the catabolic process. Vitamin C supplements in fast-food diet fed mice significantly decreased diet ingestion and increased water intake. Histopathological analysis revealed that the mice fed a fast-food diet with vitamin C water had a mild renal injury suggesting osmotic nephrosis due to fructose-mediated purine derivatives. These data suggest that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment suppresses high-fructose-diet-mediated NAFLD progression by decreasing diet ingestion and increasing water intake.", "sitename": "MDPI", "date": "2022-05-25", "cleaned_text": "[2](#B2-nutrients-14-02195)]. NAFLD is a disease which has a broad spectrum, ranging from mild forms of NALD including nonalcoholic fatty such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma [ [1](#B1-nutrients-14-02195)]. In previous research, a sedentary lifestyle and Western diet characterized by a high content of refined grains, sugar, and saturated fat, are spreading in both developing and developed countries, and the prevalence of chronic metabolic disorders has increased [ [2](#B2-nutrients-14-02195)]. As a result, NAFLD has become one of the most common chronic liver diseases that has a 25.24% incidence rate worldwide [ [3](#B3-nutrients-14-02195)]. Because the global burden of NAFLD is constantly increasing, there has been much research about the specific drugs and therapeutic strategies to treat NAFLD. However, the precise pathogenesis and specific therapeutic strategies of NAFLD have not been fully understood yet, and additional research is urgently needed. [4](#B4-nutrients-14-02195)]. Vitamin C is also a coenzyme with a crucial role in many biosynthesis pathways and immune functions [ [5](#B5-nutrients-14-02195)]. Vitamin C is a strong antioxidant and reduces oxidative-stress-induced cellular damage by inhibition of superoxide radicals [ [6](#B6-nutrients-14-02195)]. Vitamin C is non-toxic, and the long-term safety of vitamin C intake has already been reported in many investigations [ [7](#B7-nutrients-14-02195)]. [8](#B8-nutrients-14-02195)]. In human beings, the mega-dose vitamin C treatment (Intravenous, 60 g) also exhibited potential therapeutic effects on COVID-19 patients [ [8](#B8-nutrients-14-02195)]. Other researchers have also suggested that mega-dose vitamin C (Intravenous, 5-45 g per day and/or Oral, 5-20 g per day) might inhibit growth of tumor cells by enhancing human immune responses [ [9](#B9-nutrients-14-02195)]. Other researchers also reported that the negative correlation between mega-dose vitamin C treatments and attenuated uric acid related diseases in human beings [ [10](#B10-nutrients-14-02195), [11](#B11-nutrients-14-02195)]. Moreover, any adverse effects of the mega-dose vitamin C treatment were not reported in any of these studies [ [7](#B7-nutrients-14-02195), [8](#B8-nutrients-14-02195), [9](#B9-nutrients-14-02195), [10](#B10-nutrients-14-02195), [11](#B11-nutrients-14-02195)]. Given that, it is hypothesized that mega-dose treatment with vitamin C might have beneficial effects on metabolic disorders. However, the precise mechanisms between the mega-dose vitamin C treatment and NAFLD pathogenesis have not been completely studied yet. Therefore, we planned animal experiments to study the effects of mega-dose vitamin C on NAFLD. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Animal Experimental Design 2.2. Histopathology [12](#B12-nutrients-14-02195)]. Renal tubular injury was assessed as a proportion of damaged renal tubules ( [Table 1](#nutrients-14-02195-t001)) [ [13](#B13-nutrients-14-02195)]. The average adipocyte size was determined based on five random fields at 200 times magnification for each slide. 2.3. Primary Antibodies and Chemicals 2.4. Immunohistochemistry 2.5.

Mega-Dose Vitamin C Treatment Significantly Decreased Fast-Food-Diet Mediated Body Weight Gain [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-02195-f001)A) The FFD + VC group exhibited lower body weight gain compared with the FFD group for the experimental period ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-02195-f001)B). The FFD + VC group exhibited significantly decreased body weight (p value = 0.0015) ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-02195-f001)C). Moreover, the FFD + VC groups demonstrate an almost equal increased body weight ratio (p value against to FFD group = 0.0045) with those of the chow-diet fed mice groups ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-02195-f001)D). These data indicated that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment significantly suppressed the FFD-mediated body weight gain in mice. Microscopically, the FFD + VC group demonstrated significantly decreased average adipocyte size compared to the FFD group ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-02195-f001)E,F). However, the caloric intake per body weight was equal in all the FFD-fed groups for the experimental period ( [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-02195-f001)G). These results suggest that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment markedly decreased body weight gain in the FFD mice groups. 3.2. Mega-Dose Vitamin C Treatments Reduced Hepatic Triglyceride Accumulation in the Fast-Food-Diet Fed Mice [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-02195-f002)A). Additionally, the FFD + VC mouse group showed decreased liver weights compared to the FFD mouse group ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-02195-f002)B,C). In contrast, both Chow and Chow + VC groups exhibited similar gross appearance and liver weights ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-02195-f002)A-C). In biochemical assays, the hepatic FFA, which is a main precursor for liver triglyceride synthesis, levels were significantly decreased in the FFD + VC group compared to the FFD group ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-02195-f002)C). The hepatic triglyceride levels were significantly increased in all FFD-fed mice groups compared to chow-diet fed groups suggesting FFD-mediated NAFLD progression. However, the FFD + VC group exhibited notably decreased liver triglyceride levels compared to FFD group ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-02195-f002)D). These data indicated that the vitamin C treatment selectively attenuated fast-food-diet mediated fat accumulation in liver. 3.3. Mega-Dose Vitamin C Treatment Attenuated NAFLD Progression Microscopically [Figure group exhibited significantly ameliorated steatosis lesions despite of 11 weeks of FFD feeding. Additionally, the FFD + VC group exhibited notably decreased Oil-Red-O positive areas compared to the FFD group ( [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-02195-f003)B). These data suggested that vitamin C treatment significantly decreased FFD-mediated liver fat accumulation in the mice. We also assessed the NAFLD progression of each mouse group using the NASH-CRN grading system. The histopathological examinations of the liver tissue samples revealed that after 11 weeks of FFD feeding the mice had developed NASH, a relatively late stage of NAFLD, while the FFD + VC mice group exhibited an ameliorated NAFLD progression that was similar to the chow-diet-fed mice groups ( [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-02195-f003)C-F). These data indicated that the vitamin C treatment significantly decreased not only FFD-induced triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes but also NAFLD progression. 3.4. Mega-Dose Vitamin C Treatment Attenuated Liver Injuries in the FFD-Fed Mice [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-02195-f004)A-C). These data demonstrate that vitamin C attenuated FFD-mediated liver injuries. However, serum levels of nutrients including glucose and FFA were similar in all FFD-fed mice groups despite the serum liver enzyme differences between FFD and FFD + groups ( [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-02195-f004)D,E). We are confident that nutrient absorption was not affected by vitamin C supplementation in the FFD-fed groups. Vitamin C treatment showed an improvement in the serum liver enzyme levels as well as attenuated NASH lesions in FFD-fed mice. 3.5. Mega-Dose Vitamin C Treatment Protects the Liver from NASH-Mediated Inflammatory Responses [Figure 5](#nutrients-14-02195-f005)A,B). These data indicate that vitamin C treatment reduced infiltration of inflammatory cells into the liver parenchyma. Moreover, the FFD + VC group also exhibited significantly decreased inflammatory gene expression compared than FFD group ( [Figure 5](#nutrients-14-02195-f005)C,F). This suggests that vitamin C treatment ameliorates the NASH-mediated inflammatory response. 3.6. Mega-Dose Vitamin C Treatment Attenuated NASH Independent of Catabolic Pathways [Figure 6](#nutrients-14-02195-f006)A,B). Since phosphorylated AMPK is a crucial factor in energy metabolism including catabolism and ATP synthesis, these data suggest that vitamin C mega-dose treatments in FFD mouse groups was not closely related to the catabolic process. Immunoblot analysis also revealed that there were no significant differences in PPAR- expression between FFD + VC and FFD groups ( [Figure 6](#nutrients-14-02195-f006)C,D). These data indicate that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment attenuated NASH progression independently of the catabolic process in the liver. 3.7. Mega-Dose Vitamin C Treatment Inhibits Diet Ingestion via Increased Water Intake with Compensatory Increases in Urine Volume [Figure 7](#nutrients-14-02195-f007)A,B). The FFD + VC group demonstrated increased urine volume compared to the FFD group for experimental period (data not shown). The following histopathologic assessment revealed mild renal tubular injuries in FFD + VC group compared to FFD group, suggesting increased osmotic pressures in FFD + VC mice than FFD group ( [Figure 7](#nutrients-14-02195-f007)C,D). These data insisted that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment significantly attenuated FFD-mediated NAFLD progression via inhibiting diet intake and increasing water intake in mice. 4. Discussion [Figure 1](#nutrients-14-02195-f001)), and the hepatic fat contents including triglyceride and FFA were also significantly reduced by vitamin C supplements ( [Figure 2](#nutrients-14-02195-f002)). The following histopathologic examination revealed that the FFD + VC group had drastically attenuated NASH lesions compared to the FFD group. The total NASH-CRN grade scores were significantly decreased by vitamin C treatments in the FFD-fed mice groups ( [Figure 3](#nutrients-14-02195-f003)). Serum biochemistry levels demonstrated that the hepatic enzymes ALT, ALP, and AST were elevated by 11-weeks of FFD feeding, while the serum levels of glucose and FFA were not affected by vitamin C treatments ( [Figure 4](#nutrients-14-02195-f004)). These data indicated that the therapeutic effects of mega-dose vitamin C are independent of nutrient absorption. In previous studies, prolonged high-carbohydrate and high-fat diets induce NASH development not only triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes but also through infiltration of inflammatory cells into the liver parenchyma. [ [19](#B19-nutrients-14-02195)] Consequently, Immunohistochemistry and qPCR results demonstrated that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment protects the liver from not only triglyceride accumulation but also infiltration of inflammatory cells and inflammatory cytokines ( [Figure 5](#nutrients-14-02195-f005)). Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that the mega-dose vitamin C application did not increase the level of expression of proteins involved in catabolic activities in the FFD-fed mice ( [Figure 6](#nutrients-14-02195-f006)). Therefore, we pose the question: how did the mega-dose vitamin C treatment significantly attenuate NAFLD progression independently of energy degradation? Interestingly, in this study, the FFD + VC group showed significantly higher water intake and lower food intake than FFD group ( [Figure 7](#nutrients-14-02195-f007)A,B). Interestingly, the FFD + VC group was observed with notably increased urine volume (data not shown) compared to the FFD group. According to previous study, excessive intake of fructose-rich diet increased the serum levels of purine derivatives including uric acid, allantoin and urea, and these purine derivatives are mainly excreted by the renal system in rodents [ [20](#B20-nutrients-14-02195), [21](#B21-nutrients-14-02195)]. Urea is a water-soluble end product of purine degradation. Since these solutes can cause an osmotic diuresis and osmotic nephrosis, we hypothesized that the FFD + VC group had increased excretion of purine derivatives including uric acid, allantoin, and urea in the urine compared to those in the FFD group [ [22](#B22-nutrients-14-02195)]. This hypothesis is consistent with the microscopic findings in the FFD + VC mice with prominent cytoplasmic vacuoles and swelling in cells of the proximal renal suggesting mild osmotic nephrosis ( [Figure 7](#nutrients-14-02195-f007)C,D) [ [23](#B23-nutrients-14-02195)]. Subsequently, the water intake, diet ingestion and histopathologic lesions were not affected by the mega-dose vitamin C treatment in the chow-diet fed mice groups (Chow and Chow + VC) ( [Figure 7](#nutrients-14-02195-f007)A-D). These results indicate that the mega-dose vitamin C treatment only affects the mice which were fed a fructose-rich diet for 11 weeks. Taken together, we can confirm that the mega-dose intake of vitamin C significantly increased the water intake of the FFD-fed mice with an expected increase in urine volume due to enhanced removal of FFD-mediated purine derivatives, and this increased water intake in the FFD + VC group ultimately inhibited NASH progression via reduced diet intake compared to FFD group. [24](#B24-nutrients-14-02195)]. Therefore, it is assumed that the mega-dose vitamin C treatments enhance uricase activity in FFD-fed mice. Interestingly, there have been many studies using uricase or uricase recombinant to treat uric acid related disease in human beings [ [25](#B25-nutrients-14-02195), [26](#B26-nutrients-14-02195)]. The implications this previous research and the data in the present study suggest that a combination of uricase treatment and the mega-dose vitamin C treatment might have a synergistic effect in treating uric acid related disease in human beings. [Figure 7](#nutrients-14-02195-f007)). Additionally, there were few studies reported that the mega-dose vitamin C might have adverse effects [ [27](#B27-nutrients-14-02195)]. Therefore, at first, we performed animal experiments to confirm the safety of the mega-dose vitamin C treatment in animals. As a result, the wild-type C57BL/6 mice treated by vitamin C at the same dose used in the present study for 70 weeks did not have any significant liver and kidney damage ( [Figure S1](#app1-nutrients-14-02195)). Consequently, we can confirm the safety of the mega-dose vitamin C treatment. [28](#B28-nutrients-14-02195)]. 5.
