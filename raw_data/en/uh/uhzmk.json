Upon hearing the term holistic healing, I think most people would picture some unwanted symptom going away as a result of some alternative healing modality. The truth is that holistic health and healing are much bigger than just ridding the body of unpleasant symptoms. Making symptoms go away is largely the purview of allopathic medicine, which, by itself, is not that holistic. Likewise, holistic healing is not limited to alternative healing methods like chiropractic, acupuncture or [energy work](https://www.biosoulintegration.com/energy-healing/), either. Holistic healing has to do with our evolution, which could include some combination of both traditional and non-tradiational forms of healthcare. Let's break down the word holistic healing and see what it can tell us. The word heal comes from an Old English word meaning to make whole. The word holistic comes from a Greek word that also means whole. It might appear that there's some redundancy there, but when you explore this further, it points to a deep, spiritual healing concept. In 1926, a South African man named Jan Smuts published a book titled Holism and Evolution. In this book, he referred to, \"nature's tendency to form wholes that are greater than the sum of the parts through creative evolution\" Think of it this way: You are much more than your limbs, heart, lungs, brain and individual cells. If we put together a bunch of identical parts, we still wouldn't have you. Your body and being are an infinitely complex and yet harmonious package, a hologram (if you want to learn more about this concept check out [The Holographic Universe](https://amzn.to/35OXhln) by Michael Talbot) of the most complex and harmonious thing out there: God, Source, Universe, or whatever you want to call it. The Universe is constantly spinning out versions of itself on various scales, adding greater and greater complexity to life and then reconciling that complexity such that all of that complexity is also harmonious\u2014i.e. a perfect state of oneness. This is the process of \"creative evolution\" that Smuts talked about in his book. I've come up with an anology to explain that. Here's [a video I made](https://youtu.be/qycdMaEAqzY) on the subject of holistic healing where I explain our evolution by way of the pond analogy: Or if you're more into podcasts the BioSoul Integration Podcast and this episode can be found where ever you listen to your podcasts. Imagine sitting beside a pond on a calm day. As you look out over the water, it is smooth and still. It starts to sprinkle. As a drop hits the surface of the water, it creates a ripple, which is a series of mini-waves. As more drops fall, more ripples form. As the rain picks up, the ripples continue forming, eventually running into each other. As each little wave runs into the others, they interact and are both changed. Each changed wave continues on and affects other changed waves, changing each again. Eventually every wave has affected every other wave and they all exist as a harmonious whole as they move together over the surface of the pond, now shimmering with activity. So it is with everything. Everyone and everything is connected in some way. What happens in the environment affects us and the economy. What happens in one part of the world spreads to affect another part of the world. If animals are affected, so are people. In essence, what affects me also affects you and vice versa. The healing process happens through a process of entrainment. Here's a more in-depth article I wrote on the law of entrainment and how it is the driving force behind our healing, entitled: \" [Law Of Entrainment: The Force That Life Uses To Drive Us Toward Healing](https://www.biosoulintegration.com/law-of-entrainment/).\" We are made up of many parts - spiritual, physical, emotional, mental, and social. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) defines health not only as wellness of the physical but also mental and social well-being. When we experience pain, crises, or challenges, it's because we're above to move to a greater level of complexity and harmony in order to align ourselves with the increased complexity and harmony of the Whole. We are being asked to evolve. When something other than peace occurs, we are being asked to step back and take a closer look at ourselves. We need to pick apart our actions, feelings, etc, and determine where we can improve in order to become closer to the wholeness of perfection. Our awareness needs to expand. Holistic healing brings the body, mind and spirit into harmony. The holistic healing practitioner will address the physical discord but will also look for any discord in the mind, emotion, or spiritual parts of you. The aim is to lubricate a process that's already happening\u2014a process of entraining to the Whole. Today's medical model of healing is a great example of what is known as the reductionist model. You go to a doctor with pain or other discomfort and they either treat the symptoms or send you to a specialist. How many times have you had a doctor say \"I don't treat that area\"? This method doesn't promote whole healing. This doesn't mean that the medical approach is bad, it simply means that it is only part of the healing process. It is attempting to return you to a previous state, but what Life is trying to accomplish is your growth and expansion toward a more evolved state of being. This also holds true for alternative medicine. Addressing something through alternative healthcare alone may not be holistic healing if there's something that needs to be looked at that can only be addressed by some other kind of practitioner... maybe a therapist or some other kind of specialist. And here's something to consider: Is an alternative healing method holistic if it only seeks to get rid of symptoms\u2014even if it is more \"natural?\" True healing doesn't return us to a previous state. It addresses the mental, physical, and spiritual in order to help you become closer to the Oneness that is both more complex and more harmonious. Yes, the physical symptoms may disappear for a time, the crisis may seem to resolve itself, but life has a way of having you return again and again to this place of disharmony until you evolve. Let's take high blood pressure, for example. You go to a doctor and are prescribed medication to bring your blood pressure down. This may appear to work for a time, but when you get upset, the numbers soar. When you are physically ill, they do the same. The medication may help the physical, but you need to learn to integrate your emotional reactions. Keeping your blood pressure at an even level requires you to change mentally, physically, and emotionally. When you visit a holistic healing center, it can help you achieve your goal to work on the lifelong healing process necessary for evolution. Once that holistic healing takes place, you become more connected with the individual gifts you possess. This, in turn, allows you to connect with the greater part of humanity when you share these gifts. The Universe, or Whole, needs you to contribute your unique gifts in order to further the overall evolution, the process of ever more diversity and connection, complexity and harmony that is existence.
