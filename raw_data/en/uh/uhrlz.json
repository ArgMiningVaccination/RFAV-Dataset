With that motivation in mind, we've compiled a list of 7 key tools to boost a strong immune system for you and your family. These include key nutrients that support a strong immune system, along with some easy lifestyle tips you can add into your daily routine to keep well and stay well year round. 1. Eat Nutrient-Rich Whole Foods At BePure, our philosophy focuses on eating nutrient-dense whole foods that support your health while reducing inflammation and illness. Whole foods provide our immune system with the essential vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs for optimal function. [Eating nutrient-rich whole foods](https://www.bepure.co.nz/blogs/news/eat-for-great-energy) that give you [stable blood sugar levels](https://www.bepure.co.nz/blogs/news/how-to-better-balance-your-blood-sugar) is key to obtaining - and absorbing - as many essential nutrients as possible to support your body. In a nutshell, eat an abundance of fresh seasonal vegetables, fish, eggs, nuts, seeds, meat, soaked gluten-free whole grains and legumes while avoiding gluten, refined grains, refined sugars and highly processed vegetable oils. 2. Prioritise Sleep Sleep is essential for our wellbeing, both mental and physical. You know when you get sick, and you just want to sleep all day? That's your body trying to get you into a state where it can undertake repair processes to help you recover. Routinely getting to bed by 10pm is a good way to keep our hormones in check - particularly the hormones that control our immune function. A recent study by the Sleep Foundation found a direct link between lack of quality sleep and compromised immunity. If you aren't sleeping well, you're more likely to get sick. \"Our body has to use vital nutrients to repair ourselves from the lack of sleep, instead of fighting foreign bugs.\" The study looked at the white blood cell count (a marker of infection) in participants following 29 hours of wakefulness. It found that severe sleep loss jolts the immune system into action, reflecting the same type of immediate response shown during exposure to stress. This means our body has to use vital nutrients to repair ourselves from the lack of sleep, instead of fighting foreign bugs. Struggling with your sleep? Here's some [top tips for when you just can't sleep](https://www.bepure.co.nz/blogs/news/tips-for-when-you-just-cant-sleep) to help you and your immunity along. 3. Stay Hydrated Our body is made up of 60% water, so making sure that you are getting optimal amounts of water is essential for feeling good with optimal wellness and immunity. Water transports nutrients throughout the body, aids in digestion, regulates temperature, facilitates all pathways of detoxification, protects our joints, promotes healthy bowel movements, improves mental concentration and relieves fatigue. All important for keeping your body flushed of toxins and healthy during the winter months. [How much water should you be drinking?](https://www.bepure.co.nz/blogs/news/drinking-enough-water) This should be calculated according to your weight. To work this out the formula is: 0.033 litres per kg of body weight, which roughly equates to the following amounts: - 60 kg = 2 litres - 75 kg = 2.5 litres - 90 kg= 3 litres - 105 kg = 3.5 litres if the hydration intake in your life needs some mixing up and you're looking for a hydrating, healthy, and immune-happy drink, try our [Natural Immune Boosting Elixir.](https://www.bepure.co.nz/blogs/news/bepure-super-immune-boosting-elixir) 4. Minimise Stress with Relaxation Techniques [Stress initiates coping responses in us](https://www.bepure.co.nz/blogs/news/learn-how-body-responds-stress). In ancestral times we would simply sleep and rest more. Now, we reach for stimulants to prop up our cortisol or sugar levels - caffeine, alcohol and refined sugar or grains. Consuming these things occasionally is not a problem. But all these things place a load on our liver and affect our ability to store and absorb nutrients from our food which then impacts our immunity. The harder you push your body and mind, the more stress you are under, the more vitamins and minerals your body uses. In times of stress, your body uses more B vitamins, vitamin C, magnesium and zinc - just to name a few. When it comes to diet and lifestyle there are a few key things to consider to reduce your stress levels and increase your immunity: - Try to maintain balanced blood sugar levels by [eating a diet that is right for you](https://www.bepure.co.nz/blogs/news/balance-stress-solutions)and your unique body. - Set yourself up with a calming morning routine to ground you for the day. - Activate your rest and digestive nervous system before bed.
