Worldwide, Hypertension is estimated to cause 7.5 million deaths, about 12.8% of the total of all deat hs. This accounts for 57 million disability adjust ed life years (DALYS) or 3.7% of total DALYS. This led WHO to set a targ et of 25% reduction in preval ence by 2025. To reach that, WHO has adopted non-conventional methods for the management of hypertension? Despite worldwide popularity of such non-conventional therapies, only small volume of eviden ce exists that supports its effectiveness. This review attempted to make a critical appraisal of the evidence, with the aim to (1) describe the therapeutic modalities frequently used, and (2) review the current level of evidence attributable to each modality . Databases from Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE were searched from 2005-2015. A total of 23 publications have been identified and selected. Out of these, 15 systematic reviews and/or meta-analysis of RCTs, 5 RCTs, 1 non-RCT, and 2 observational studies without control. Among those 23 pub lications, therapeutic modalities identified are: fish oil, qigong, yoga, coenzyme Q10, melatonin, meditation, vitamin D, vitamin C, monounsaturated acids, magnesium, and L-arginine. followings were found to have weak or no evidence: fish oil, yoga, vitamin D, monounsaturated fatty acid, dietary amino-acids, and osteopathy. Those found to have significant reduction in blood pressure are: magnesium, qigong, melatonin, meditation, vitamin juice and L-arginine. Coenzyme Q10on the other hand, showed contradicting results were some studies found weak or no effect on blood pressure while others showed significant blood pressure reduction effect. By virtue of the research designs and methodologies, the evidence contributed from these studies is at level 1. Results from th is review suggest that certain non-conventional therapies may be effective in treating hypertension and improving cardiac function and therefore considered as part of an evidence- based approach. Keywords : Hypertension, non-conventional management, evidence-based therapy. INTRODUCTION Hypertension is one of the ma jor causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Globa lly CVD accounts for 17 million deaths annually (WHO, 2013). In 2010, hypertension was ranked as th e leading single risk factor for global burden of diseases. Furthermore, hypertension complications accounted for 9. 4 million deaths and 7% of the disability-adjusted lif e years' (DALYs) lost worldwide (Lim et al ., 2012). The magnitude of hypertension is rising speedily, affecting about 40% of adults aged 25 years and above (WHO, 2011). In May 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed a set of global voluntary targets for non- communicable diseases, and hypertension was targeted for a 25% reduction in the prevalence by 2025 (WHO, 2013b). The common conventional medications used for treating hypertension are diuretics, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and renin inhibitors. Despite being the most easily controlled risk factor for CVD, hypertension often leads to impaired cardiac function, or hypertensive heart disease. Vi ctor (2012) has postulated that more than one third of hypertensive patients end up with stroke, myocardial infarction, or heart failure even though their blood pressure is under control. Over the last 20 years, th ere have been a number of studies on hypertension and cardiac function using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), or non- conventional therapies. It is not often that the results of CAM therapies contribute to sc ientific evidence. The bulk of the evidence from CAM is in case reports and case *Corresponding author: e-mail: dryamankassab@yahoo.com Non-conventional therapies for Vol.31, No.1, January 2018, pp.237-244 238series, which occupy the lower strata of evidence contribution. The popularity of CAM has increased over the last two decades. The use of non-conventional therapies among patients with hypertension and its sequel of CVD are prevalent and in many instances provide positive clinically significant effects (Nahas,2008; Houston,2010; Rabito and kaye 2013). Most of the non-conventional therapies come from micronutrients usage. Others include biological-based therapies, mind-body therapies, homoeopathy, qigong, acupuncture, and yoga. Methodology Search method This review attempts to make a critical appraisal of studies from 2005 to early 2015.The aims of this review were:(1) To review the current level of evidence attributed to those non-conventional therapies that are more frequently used in the tr eatment of hypertension. (2) To describe those therapies that occupies the highest level of evidence deriving from systematic review and meta- analysis. The search method ology for hypertension in literature published in English language, through the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, PUBMED, and EMBASE databases, was for the period 2005 to January 2015. The following key words, in different combinations, were used: hypertension or high blood pressure with non-conventional therapies, natu ral therapies, nutrients, micronutrients, vitamins, minerals, amino-acids, coenzyme Q10, ubiquinone, melatonin, herbs, traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture, qigong, meditation, yoga, and homoeopathy. Only clinical trials on humans and prospective studies were select ed as they contribute to higher levels of evidence. Re trospective or animal studies were excluded from this review. Level of evidence There are basically four le vels of evidence widely accepted in the scientific an d healthcare field. Adapting from the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine and United States Agency for Healthcare Policy and Research, the four levels of evidence are: Level-1: Randomized controlled trials - includes quasi- randomized processes. Level-2: Non-randomized trials - prospective studies with predetermined eligibility criteria and outcome measures. Level-3: Observational studies with controls - retro- spective, interrupted time series, case-controlled studies, cohort studies with controls, and researches that include adjustment for confounding factors. Level-4: Observational studies without controls - cohort studies, case series, case reports, and expert opinions. With this categorization, however, not all levels of evidence are of equal value. It should not be misunderstood that those studies categorized at the lower levels are not important. A ll levels of evidence are important and each has its own value. RESULTS Evidence-based review Searches from 2005 to January 2015 revealed a total of 23 publications on the topic of interest. Of the 23 publications, 15 were systematic reviews and/or meta- analysis, 5 RCTs, 1 non-RCT and 2 observational studies without control table1 summarizes all studies selected (table 1). From the 23 publications, non-conventional therapeutic modalities identified were: fish oil, qigong, yoga, coenzyme melatonin, transcendental meditation, L-arginine. The followings were found to have a weak or no evidence: fish oil, yoga, vitamin D, monounsaturated fatty acid, dietary amino-acids, and osteopathy. Those found to have significant reduction in blood pressure are: magnesium, qigong, melatonin, meditation, ginine and coenzyme Q10. By virtue of the research designs and methodologies, the evidence contributed from these studies is at level 1. Table 2 summarizes the strength of the evidence supporting the non-conventi onal approaches to the lowering of blood pressure (table 2) Evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analysis of RCTs supports the blood pressure lowering of qigong, melatonin, meditation, vitamin C, inorganic nitrate, beetroot juice and L-arginine, and coenzyme Q10. Evidence from an RCT each also supports blood pressure lowering by chiropractic and folate. DISCUSSION Qigong Qigong (also known as yang sheng ) is an ancient Chinese energy medicine that s timulates the flow of qi, or life energy through a group of postures, movements, breathing patterns, and meditation. it is claimed that the healthy flow of qi throughout the body has healing effect against cardiovascular diseases (Sancier and Holman, 2004). Even though 3 systema tic reviews on the effects of qigong on hypertension showed some encouraging results for lowering blood pressure, the conclusiveness of the evidence has several short comings. Chief among these lies in the methodological quality of the studies, where the risk of bias is generally high. Furthermore, for causal relationship the mechanism of action must be well explained, and this is lacking in the studies of qigong and hypertension. More rigorous trial designs are warranted to confirm these results (Lee et al ., 2007; Guo X et al ., 2008; Xiong X et al., 2015). Ang Peng Wong et al Pak. J. Pharm.

Known for its role as antioxidant (Hardeland et al ., impo rtant role in the circadian rhythm and the regulation of sleep cycles (Scheer F et al., 2004). In most hypertensive cases, the high blood pressure phenomenon can be explained from the oxidative stress theory. Excessive oxidation from oxygen free radicals leads to endothelia l dysfunction and eventual constriction of blood vessels. The majority of people have fluctuating blood pressure in a 24-hour period, which is highest in the day and lowest at night, called the nocturnal dip. This nocturnal dipping is a natural phenomenon and non-dipping has been associated with increased frequency of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (Ingelsson E et al., 2006). On the basis of its antioxidant and regulatory role of circadian rhythm, melatonin may have a role in Table 1C : Summary of the study with non-RCT Authors Year Subjects Research design Intervention Main outcome Cerritelli et al 2011 N = 63 Non-randomized controlled trial Osteopathy Significantly associated with improvement in SBP, but not DBP.

The meta-analysis of RCTs by Grossman and colleagues concluded that with controlled-release melatonin, nocturnal blood pressure was significantly reduced (Grossman E et al ., 2011). Larger trials with longer duration are required to determine long-term benefici al effects of melatonin. Standardization of dose and frequency of treatment is also needed. Transcendental meditation Transcendental meditation (TM) is a specific form of mantra meditation that is aimed to bring the mind into a state of pure consciousness. This means the mind is 'transcended' into a state of perfect rest, stillness, and absence of mental boundaries. It also means the psychosomatic mode comes to a state of total relaxation and free from stress. Relaxation is an antagonist to stress. If what is claimed about TM is true, therefore the achievement of total relaxation through TM may have an effect on blood pressure through the neuro-hormonal pathway. The study of Anderson and colleagues using meta-analysis of 9 RCTs concluded that TM has the potential to lower blood pressure and is clinically significant. Of the 9 RCTs studied, only 3 were of high quality (Anderson J et al., 2008). More studies in a larger population are warranted to further determine the positive effect of TM on hypertension. Vitamin C There are multiple known physiological functions of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) in the human body. Perhaps those functions that play a di rect or indirect role on hypertension are the antioxidant role of scavenging superoxide anion, the improvement of endothelial vasomotor dysfunction, as well as diuresis. However, the efficiency of ascorbic acid in its scavenging role is dose dependent. Sherman and colleagues has shown that it is necessary to maintain a high or pharmacological dose for ascorbic acid to achieve the result of reversing endothelial dysfunction (Sherman D et al ., 2000). The systematic review and meta-analysis of 29 RCTs by Juraschek and colleagues concluded that in short-term trials, vitamin C supplementation lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The median dose used was 500 mg/day, while the median duration of study in the 29 RCTs was 8 weeks (Juraschek S et al., 2012). Long-term trials on the effects of vitamin C supplementation on blood pressure will ensure its efficacy potential. Inorganic nitrate, beetroot juice, and beetroot bread According to European food safety authority (EFSA), Both beetroot juice and beetroot bread have high content of inorganic nitrate, ranging from 110 to 3670 mg of nitrate/kg, and a median concentration of 1,100 mg/kg. The blood pressure lowering effects of inorganic nitrate may derive from the generation of NO which affects the endothelium and causes arteriodilation (Kelm M, 1999; Siervo M et al., 2011). Reduced NO bioavailability may lead to endothelial dysfunction resulting in higher risk of hypertension as well as cardi ovascular diseases (Avogaro A et al ., ., 2011b). Systematic inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supp lementation were associated with a significant reduction of systolic blood pressure (Siervo et al., 2013). Long-term studies on the efficacy of inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supplementation, together with assessment of safety and tolerance holds promise. L-arginine There are two possible pathways for the synthesis of NO: the enzymatic and the non-enzymatic pathways. The non- enzymatic pathway involves the reduction of nitrate to nitrite and finally to NO. This requires the help of acidification process and low pH of biological tissues (Lundberg J et al ., 2009; Zweier J et al ., 1999). The enzymatic pathway, or the classical L-arginine NO synthase pathway, is dependent on the endothelium for its synthesis. The loss of NO bioactivity is an important feature of endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. Therefore, supplementing a su bstrate to enhance nitric oxide production may be a rational treatment approach. L-arginine serves as the princi pal substrate for vascular NO production. The endothelial isoform of the NO synthase uses L-arginine as precur sor to release NO in the endothelium. This is crucial for the control of vascular Table 3 : Summary of CAM intervention on blood pressure lowering No evidence Weak evidence Significant evidence 1. Yoga 1. Fish oil 1. Qigong 2.

Dong and colleagues' meta-analysis of 11 RCTs concluded that L- arginine supplementation significantly lowers systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Dong J et al., 2011). Large scale and longer-term trials are needed to confirm its blood pressure lowering effect as well as safety and possible pro-oxidative effect. Coenzyme Q10 Coenzyme Q10, also known as ubiquinone because of its ubiquitous distribution in nature, is a fat-soluble molecule obtained through tissue synthesis, which acts as an electron carrier in mitochond ria and as a coenzyme for mitochondrial enzymes (Langsjoen P et al ., 1985). The bioenergetics and antioxidant properties of coenzyme Q10 make it unique. Studies suggest that coenzyme Q10 deficiency may be asso ciated with different cardiovascular conditions such as ischemic heart disease and heart failure (Langsjoen et al ., 1985b). It also has potential to lower blood pressure (Burke B et al ., 2001; Rosenfeldt et al., 2007). The mechanistic pathway which coenzyme Q10 might work is an antioxidant effect acting directly on vascular endothelium for vasodilation or by reducing super oxide synthesis (McCarty M, 1999). Another possible mechanism is the anti-atherogenic effects as a modulator of beta-integrins levels on the surface of blood monocytes (Quinzii et al., 2007; Turunen M et al., and colleagues' meta-analysis of 3 RCTs, 1 crossover trial, and 8 observational studies concluded that coenzyme Q10 supplementation significantly lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure (Rosenfeldt et al ., 2007). However, the methodological qualities of those studies were low and open to several types of bias. Better-designed studies over longer period are warranted to confirm the efficacy of coenzyme Q10. Yoga Regarding the effect of yogaon blood pressure, mixed types of results were observed. Some studies found that Yoga had a significant lowering effect on both SBP as well as DBP (Xiong et al., 2015; Tyagi & Cohen 2014; Hagins et al ., 2013). Others concluded that the complementary role of yoga in treating hypertension is encouraging, but inconclusive (Posadzki et al., 2014). On the other hand, another study revealed no evidence that Yoga has any effect on blood pressure (Cramer et al ., 2014). The result of this review on the effects of CAM therapies on hypertension has shown that there is a current surge of potential evidence in its complementary role in the treatment of hypertension. This is in comparison to a previous review in 2008 on the effects of CAM therapies on hypertension (Nahas, 2008). Their role may be both in reductions in blood pressure and/or reducing target organ damage. The type of evidence provided by CAM intervention on blood pressure lowering is summarized in table 3. CONCLUSION All the therapies discussed in this review, particularly qigong, melatonin, transcendental meditation, vitamin C, inorganic nitrate, beetroot, L-arginine and coenzyme Q10; have the potential to reduce blood pressure, improve cardiac function and cardiovasc ular health, decrease the need for antihypertensive medications, and reduce morbidity and mortality. Th e economic cost of managing hypertension may be consider ably reduced. This review also points to an integrative approach of conventional pharmacological treatment along with non-conventional therapies as the way forw ard for the treatment and management of hypertension. This is also in line with the aspiration of WHO to reduce the prevalence of hypertension by 25%, by 2025.
