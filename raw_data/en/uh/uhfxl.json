The only way forward for the World Health Organization is if it can actually demonstrate independence from China.\" The threat is more proof of Trump's instinct to distrust global institutions at a time when many of his predecessors would rely on such relationships to help stem the tide of a pandemic. [Trump says he's taking malaria drug to protect against virus](https://apnews.com/0fbe485717c9a74e6d6c48aee7d208ae) President Donald Trump said Monday that he is taking a malaria drug to protect against the coronavirus, despite warnings from his own government that it should only be administered for COVID-19 in a hospital or research setting due to potentially fatal side effects. Trump told reporters he has been taking the drug, hydroxychloroquine, and a zinc supplement daily \"for about a week and a half now.\" Trump spent weeks pushing the drug as a potential cure or prophylaxis for COVID-19 against the cautionary advice of many of his administration's top medical professionals. The drug has the potential to cause significant side effects in some patients and has not been shown to combat the new coronavirus. Trump said his doctor did not recommend the drug to him, but he requested it from the White House physician. [Moderna: Early coronavirus vaccine results are encouraging](https://apnews.com/fc2a2346bad9e0a17917a4aa1c73607c) An experimental vaccine against the coronavirus showed encouraging results in very early testing, triggering hoped-for immune responses in eight healthy, middle-aged volunteers. Study volunteers given either a low or medium dose of the vaccine by Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. had antibodies similar to those seen in people who have recovered from COVID-19. In all, 45 people have received one or two shots of the vaccine, which was being tested at three different doses. The kind of detailed antibody results needed to assess responses are only available on eight volunteers so far. The vaccine seems safe, the company said, but much more extensive testing is needed to see if it remains so. A high dose version is being dropped after spurring some short-term side effects. [Beaches, parks busy as Europe heat wave and U.S. spring test new coronavirus rules](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus/beaches-parks-busy-as-europe-heat-wave-and-u-s-spring-test-new-coronavirus-rules-idUSKBN22T0OA) Summer weather is enticing much of the world to emerge from coronavirus lockdowns as centers of the outbreak from New York to Italy and Spain gradually lift restrictions that have kept millions indoors for months. People are streaming back to beaches, parks and streets just as a heat wave hits southern Europe and spring-like temperatures allow Americans to shed winter coats. As they venture out again, most are keeping their distance and some are wearing masks. However, protests are also heating up from Germany to England to the United States, arguing the government restrictions demolish personal liberties and are wrecking economies. [Trump administration outlines audacious plan to deliver 'hundreds of millions' of Covid-19 vaccine doses by end of 2020](https://www.statnews.com/2020/05/15/trump-audacious-plan-vaccine-covid19/) The Trump administration on Friday rolled out a hyper-ambitious plan to develop and manufacture hundreds of millions of Covid-19 vaccine doses by the end of 2020, outlining an aggressive process that, if successful, would shatter conventional wisdom about the typical process for developing vaccines for emerging infectious diseases. At a Rose Garden press conference, the president and his deputies acknowledged their goal, dubbed \"Operation Warp Speed,\" was lofty. [13 USS Roosevelt Sailors Test Positive For COVID-19, Again](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/16/857379338/5-uss-roosevelt-sailors-test-positive-for-covid-19-again) The U.S. Navy says 13 sailors from the USS Theodore Roosevelt who had apparently recovered from the coronavirus and had received negative test results have now tested positive for a second time. In a statement released earlier on Saturday when five sailors were found to have retested positive, the Navy said the sailors had \"met rigorous recovery criteria, exceeding CDC guidelines,\" including testing negative for the virus at least twice, but have now retested positive. The statement said the sailors had been monitoring their health and adhered to social-distancing protocols while on board the Roosevelt, which has been docked in Guam following an outbreak infecting hundreds of crew members. \"These five Sailors developed influenza-like illness symptoms and did the right thing reporting to medical for evaluation,\" the statement said. [Powell: Recovery may begin by summer, will likely be slow](https://apnews.com/c0ef6213049cbadcebbbd9ae31c972fb) Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell expressed optimism Sunday that the U.S. economy can begin to recover from a devastating recession in the second half of the year, assuming the coronavirus doesn't erupt in a second wave. But he suggested that a full recovery won't likely be possible before the arrival of a vaccine. In an interview with CBS's \"60 Minutes,\" Powell noted that the economy was fundamentally healthy before the virus struck suddenly and forced widespread business shutdowns and tens of millions of layoffs. Once the outbreak has been contained, he said, the economy should be able to rebound \"substantially.\" [CDC Issues Tools To Guide Reopening Of Schools, Businesses, Transit](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/14/856483424/cdc-issues-decision-tools-to-guide-reopening-of-schools-businesses-transit) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a set of documents on Thursday designed to provide guidance on how childcare centers, schools, restaurants and bars, and other establishments could begin the process of reopening in the face of coronavirus. The direction comes after calls from lawmakers and state officials mounted for the CDC to weigh in on how regions should reopen their economies. The decision tools the agency released recommend that all workplaces hold off on reopening unless they are ready to protect employees at higher risk for severe illness, including those 65 and older and people of all ages with underlying medical conditions. [CDC alerts doctors to COVID-19 linked condition in children](https://apnews.com/6f0a0a01e67215bfba6a6774a458d98d) The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is warning doctors about a serious rare inflammatory condition in children linked with the coronavirus. In an alert issued Thursday, the CDC called the condition multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. The agency's case definition includes current or recent COVID-19 infection or exposure to the virus, a fever of at least 100.4 for at least 24 hours, severe illness requiring hospitalization, inflammatory markers in blood tests, and evidence of problems affecting at least two organs that could include the heart, kidneys, lungs, skin or other nervous system. The name and definition are similar to those used in Europe, where the condition was first reported several weeks ago. [U.S. faces 'darkest winter' if pandemic planning falters: whistleblower](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-usa-bright/u-s-faces-darkest-winter-if-pandemic-planning-falters-whistleblower-idUSKBN22Q1JH) A whistleblower who says he was removed from his government post for raising concerns about coronavirus preparedness told a congressional hearing on Thursday that the United States could face \"the darkest winter\" of recent times if it does not improve its response to the pandemic. Hours after President Donald Trump railed against him on Twitter, whistleblower Rick Bright testified to a U.S. House of Representatives panel about readiness for the outbreak. Bright was removed last month as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, or BARDA, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responsible for developing drugs to fight the coronavirus. \"What we do must be done carefully with guidance from the best scientific minds. Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to improve our response now, based on science, I fear the pandemic will get worse and be prolonged,\" Bright said during his testimony. [Another 3 million Americans file for unemployment benefits](https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/14/economy/unemployment-benefits-coronavirus/index.html) Millions of Americans are relying on unemployment benefits for their livelihoods after losing their jobs to the coronavirus crisis. Another 3 million people filed initial unemployment claims last week on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to the Department of Labor That brings the total number of first-time claimants to 36.5 million since mid-March It was the eighth week in a row that the number for initial claims decreased after peaking at 6.9 million in the final week of March. Economists say this is relatively good news because it means things aren't getting worse. Initial jobless claims are one of the most \"real-time\" measures of the economy available. Most economic data lags behind by weeks if not months. That's why the weekly claims data are so important during this crisis. But now that initial claims have been falling for two months straight, economists are beginning to shift their focus to continuing jobless claims, which count people who are filing multiple weeks in a row. That number stood at 22.8, up slightly from the prior week. [Fed Chief Says More Relief Spending May Be 'Costly, But Worth It'](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/05/13/855201084/fed-chief-says-more-relief-spending-may-be-costly-but-worth-it) Additional government spending may be necessary to avoid long-lasting fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday. Powell said the economy should recover once the virus is under control. But he cautioned that without more help, many small businesses may not survive that long. And he warned that a wave of business and household bankruptcies could do lasting damage to the nation's economic output. \"We ought to do what we can to avoid these outcomes,\" Powell said, in a speech to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. He noted that Congress has already provided $2.9 trillion to prop up the economy \u2014 \"the fastest and largest response for any postwar downturn\" \u2014 but said more federal spending is needed. \"Additional fiscal support could be costly, but worth it if it helps avoid long-term damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery,\" Powell said. House Democrats unveiled an additional $3 trillion spending proposal this week. Powell said the central bank would continue to use its own tools to support the economy, but he dismissed the idea of negative interest rates. [Coronavirus to shrink global economy by 3.2% this year, U.N. forecasts](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coronavirus-to-shrink-global-economy-by-32-this-year-un-forecasts-2020-05-13) The United Nations forecast Wednesday that the COVID-19 pandemic will shrink the world economy by 3.2% this year, the sharpest contraction since the Great Depression in the 1930s. The U.N.'s mid-year report said the impact of the coronavirus crisis is expected to slash global economic output by nearly $8.5 trillion over the next two years, wiping out nearly all gains of the last four years. In January, before COVID-19 became a pandemic, the U.N. had forecast a modest acceleration in growth of 2.5% in 2020. But U.N. chief economist Elliott Harris told a news conference launching the report that the global economic outlook \"has changed drastically\" since then, with the pandemic's death toll climbing toward 300,000. \"With the large-scale restrictions of economic activities and heightened uncertainties, the global economy has come to a virtual standstill in the second quarter of 2020,\" he said. \"We are now facing the grim reality of a severe recession of a magnitude not seen since the Great Depression.\" [Coronavirus 'May Never Go Away,' a Top W.H.O. Official Warns](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/world/coronavirus-world-news-updates.html) The World Health Organization cautioned that the virus might linger for a long time. \"It is important to put this on the table: This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,\" said Mike Ryan, the head of the W.H.O. emergency response team. \"This virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,\" Mike Ryan, head of the organization's health emergencies program, said at a news briefing. \"H.I.V. has not gone away but we've come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we have found the prevention methods, and people don't feel as scared as they did before.\" \"There are no promises in this and there are no dates,\" he said, tamping down expectations that the invention of a vaccine for the coronavirus will provide a quick and complete end to what has become a global health and economic calamity. A good vaccine might be developed, but there is no telling when, he added, calling it \"a moon shot.\" If infected people become immune or resistant, then when enough people have had the virus, there will be fewer left who can catch it or spread it, making outbreaks more manageable. But no one knows how long that will take. [U.N. warns of global mental health crisis due to COVID-19 pandemic](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-mentalhealth/u-n-warns-of-global-mental-health-crisis-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-idUSKBN22Q0AO) A mental illness crisis is looming as millions of people worldwide are surrounded by death and disease and forced into isolation, poverty and anxiety by the pandemic of COVID-19, United Nations health experts said on Thursday. \"The isolation, the fear, the uncertainty, the economic turmoil - they all cause or could cause psychological distress,\" said Devora Kestel, director of the World Health Organization's (WHO) mental health department. Presenting a U.N. report and policy guidance on COVID-19 and mental health, Kestel said an upsurge in the number and severity of mental illnesses is likely, and governments should put the issue \"front and centre\" of their responses. \"The mental health and wellbeing of whole societies have been severely impacted by this crisis and are a priority to be addressed urgently,\" she told reporters at a briefing. The report highlighted several regions and sections of societies as vulnerable to mental distress - including children and young people isolated from friends and school, healthcare workers who are seeing thousands of patients infected with and dying from the new coronavirus. [Fauci warns: More death, econ damage if US reopens too fast](https://apnews.com/e64f20bbacb7d48d15e1d76339220486) The U.S. government's top infectious disease expert issued a blunt warning Tuesday that cities and states could \"turn back the clock\" and see more COVID-19 deaths and economic damage alike if they lift coronavirus stay-at-home orders too fast -- a sharp contrast as President Donald Trump pushes to right a free-falling economy. \"There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci warned a Senate committee and the nation as more than two dozen states have begun to lift their lockdowns as a first step toward economic recovery. The advice from Fauci and other key government officials \u2014 delivered by dramatic, sometimes awkward teleconference \u2014 was at odds with a president who urges on protests of state-ordered restraints and insists that \"day after day, "}
