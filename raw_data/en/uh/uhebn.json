High-Level Committee on Programmes work programme for 2003-2004 .................. 872CEB/2003/7 I. Introduction 1. The High-Level Committee on Programmes (HLCP) of the United Nations Chief Executives Board (CEB) for Coordination held its sixth session at CastelGandolfo near Rome, on 18 and 19 September 2003. The agenda of the meeting andthe list of participants are attached in annexes I and II, respectively. 2. The Committee observed a minute of silence in memory of the victims of the bombing of the United Nations compound in Baghdad on 19 August 2003. II. Reflections on current developments 3. The session began with a reflection on recent events, ranging fromdevelopments in the Middle East to the out come of the Fifth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, held in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. 4. The Committee drew on the briefing provided by the Assistant Secretary- General for Economic and Social Affairs on the report of the Secretary-General onthe Implementation of the United Nations Millennium Declaration (A/58/323), aswell as that provided by the representative of the United Nations Conference onTrade and Development on the Canc\u00fan World Trade Organization meeting. 5. The Committee then had an extensive discussion on the concept of multilateralism. It invited the Chairman to convey the thrust of the discussion toCEB. The wide-ranging exchange on multila teralism provided a broad overview for participants, who will brief their Executive Heads on the discussion. III. Financing for development 6. The Committee considered the issue of financing for development on the basisof document CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.26 prepared by the Department of Economicand Social Affairs. 7. Presenting the document via audiolink with New York, the representative of the Department recalled the decisions of HL CP at its intersessional meeting, held on 2 July 2003, and pointed to a number of issues relating to the follow-up to theInternational Conference on Financing for Development calling for the specialattention of CEB members. 8. These issues included: assisting developing countries to strengthen their capacity to mobilize domestic financia l resources; facilitating international investment flows; building capacity for the collection and dissemination ofinternational financial data and for trad e negotiations; enhancing aid effectiveness; and facilitating work on external debt workouts. 9. The representative of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs also raised the issue of the role of CEB in addressing systemic issues and thestrengthening of secretariat and intergove rnmental interactions to enhance the impact of the follow-up processes. 10. The following points emerged in the discussion that followed:3CEB/2003/7 While an exchange of views would take place at the High-Level Dialogue (29- 30 October), the final outcome would be negotiated in the Second Committee. Further discussion on the follow-up should take into account the political context, including the implications of increased military expenditures; growing fiscal deficits in donor countries and sluggish growth in Europe and Japan, aswell as the implications of the failure of the Fifth Ministerial Meeting of the World Trade Organization, held at Canc\u00fan, Mexico, for resource mobilization,particularly official development assistance. The issue of the extent to which intervening events place into question the continued validity of some of the assumptions underlying the MonterreyConsensus of the International Conference on Financing for Developmentneeds to be addressed. There is a continuing contradicti on between additionality of resources preconditioned on performance, on the one hand, and resource needs as aprecondition for performance, on the other. There is a need to examine the impli cations for United Nations core resources of the diversion of resources going to global funds and bilateral channels. It is important to monitor closely pledges of official development assistance made at Monterrey and the implications fo r the CEB advocacy role in this regard. 11. The Committee gave guidance on recasting the note for submission to CEB so as to facilitate a focused discussion. The re sults are reflected in annex III. It was observed that some of the issues raised in the note would also be relevant to CEB consideration of other agenda items and that in many of the areas dealt with in the note, it would only be possible for CEB to have a preliminary exchange of views atthe current session, providing guidance for further inter-agency work. IV . HIV/AIDS and its linkages with food security and governance 12. The Committee considered the issue of HIV/AIDS and its linkages with food security and governance in the Southern and Eastern Africa region, on the basis ofdocument CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.27, prepared collaboratively by 11 agencies withthe Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)/World FoodProgramme (WFP) as task leaders. Introducing the document, the representative ofUNAIDS emphasized that this was an issue where the system clearly had theopportunity to demonstrate collective impact on the triple crisis. Gains in the waragainst AIDS were unclear: evidence on the ground indicated that the epidemic wascontinuing to escalate. Life expectancy was on the decline by as much as 25 years insome countries, along with the increase in morbidity; there was a perceived lack offull commitment and of true joint programming; and access to drugs remainedwoefully inadequate: out of an infected population of 29 million in the region, lessthan 15,000 had access to affordable drugs. 13. The ensuing discussion focused on the multifaceted nature of the crisis and the need to call upon the collective capacity of the system to provide urgent, unified andintensified holistic responses. In the area of access to affordable drugs, theCommittee stressed the opportunity for the system to assist and encourage4CEB/2003/7 developing countries to make use of the modalities provided by the agreements reached within the Doha framework on Trade-Related Aspects of IntellectualProperty Rights (TRIPS). Suggestions were made for greater involvement of line ministries, including education and h ealth in programming instruments and processes; and for United Nations assistance in developing mechanisms that wouldallow the system to interact with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis andMalaria, to monitor the epidemic and track resource flows from all sources to theSouthern Africa region. 14. Participants indicated that the document should demonstrate more clearly the nexus between HIV/AIDS, food security and governance and the connectionbetween food security with livelihoods strategy and agricultural practices, includingdrought management. Explicit recognition must be given to government ownershipand leadership, particularly on such issues as the determination of country prioritiesand the budgetary and resource allocation pr ocess. The document should also clarify the United Nations system's relationships with Governments, non-governmentalorganizations and the private sector to better support communities' governancesystems and strengthen their resilience. It should also give emphasis to preventionand treatment and to sexual and reproductive health, as well as reflect the outcomeof the thirteenth International Conf erence on AIDS and Sexually Transmitted Infections in Africa, held in Nairobi from 21 to 26 September 2003. 15. In the light of the comments, a revised document was issued during the course of the meeting and endorsed by the Committee on an ad referendum basis. TheCommittee agreed that a revised version should be circulated by 24 September, sothat its members may consult their Executive Heads and a final text prepared forsubmission to CEB. The text is contained in annex IV . 16. The Committee called for urgent, collective and intensified commitment and action by the system to assist affected countries in responding to HIV/AIDS and todemonstrate in the process that the system could make a visible difference andimpact on the ground. In this context, it underscored the need for effective synergiesbetween its policy role and the operational role of the United Nations Development Group at the country level. V . Follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development 17. In the context of the follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Committee considered a note (CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.25) on inter-agency collaboration in the implementation of the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation, focusing on the areas of freshwater and water and sanitation, energy, oceans and coastal areas, and changing unsustainable patterns ofconsumption and production; and an Invent ory of existing inter-agency coordination mechanisms and collaborative arrangements and joint projects. 18. Introducing the note, the Director of the CEB secretariat recalled the considerations approved by HLCP at its intersessional meeting of 2 July 2003 (seeCEB/2003/6) to guide the developmen t of inter-agency coordination and collaborative arrangements in the areas identified above. The basic approach in putting forth proposals for inter-agency collaboration was to ensure an effective and5CEB/2003/7 integrated framework for follow-up to the Summit. In doing so, the paper underscored the different elements of a function-based approach for coordination and the variety of coordination models pursu ed thus far by the system. The Director also recalled the considerations underlying the 2000 reform of the CEB coordinationmachinery, which was intended to introdu ce more dynamic, flexible and function- based approaches for coordination with th e involvement of new stakeholders and other key external partners. 19. The Director pointed out that the note, which responded to the Committee's specific request, especially highlighted subs tantive issues in relation to freshwater and energy. In the area of freshwater, he drew attention to the World Water Development Report and the main issues emerging from recent analyses, which included mismanagement of water resour ces, uneven distribution of water across regions and pricing policies. In the area of energy, the note provided a picture of thecapacity of the United Nations system in terms of ongoing work, as well as existinggaps in the system's capacity. 20. In the ensuing discussion, Committee members offered a number of observations, some of which are highlighted below: The importance of ensuring that the follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development should be integrated with the follow-up to otherconferences and summits, including the Millennium Declaration, and attentionshould accordingly be given to interrelationships among issues and thepotential synergies of measur es taken to address them. In considering inter-agency collaboration arrangements, maximum use should be made of available existing mechanisms for coordination. A number of observations were made in regard to future collaboration in the area of freshwater, highlighting the value of ongoing work. With regard to water and sanitation, atte ntion should be given to interlinkages with health issues, population and the role of women in managing waterresources. In the field of energy, emphasis was placed on the need to involve non-United Nations partners in any coordination mechanism and on the potential of energysavings in the urban transport sector. In the area of oceans and coastal areas, the importance of ensuring the involvement of the proposed Oceans and Coastal Area Network was stressed,with the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office ofLegal Affairs of the Secretariat in the lead, in the preparation of the Global Marine Assessment report; and the need to better utilize and build uponexisting coordination mechanisms, such as the United Nations Atlas on theOceans, the Global Oceans Observing System and the Joint Group of Expertson the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection. 21. The Committee endorsed the recommendations contained in the note on inter- agency collaborative arrangements in the areas of freshwater and water andsanitation, energy, oceans and coastal areas, and changing unsustainable patterns ofconsumption and production. In the particular case of energy, the Committeerequested its Vice-Chairman to convene a subgroup of the organizations mostconcerned to prepare proposals on system-wide collaborative arrangements and to6CEB/2003/7 submit an interim report by the end of 2003, as well as a final report to the spring 2004 session of HLCP. Progress achieved in the interim would be reflected in thereport for the next session of the Commission on Sustainable Development to beheld in April 2004 (see annex V to the present report). 22. The Committee invited its members to provide additional information, as necessary, to help update the Inventor y of existing inter-agency coordination mechanisms and collaborative arrangement s and joint projects (see appendix I to annex V). VI. Conflict prevention 23. The Committee considered the issue of conflict prevention in the light of theinformation contained in the report before it on the subject (CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.21).In presenting the report, the Director of the CEB secretariat highlighted the salientprovisions of General Assembly resolution 57/337 of 3 July 2003 on the preventionof armed conflict, in which the Assembly called, inter alia, for a detailed review of the United Nations system's capacity for conflict prevention; the identification ofthe proper framework for the elaborati on of system-wide coherent and action- oriented strategies; rationalizing the fundi ng procedures for the prevention of armed conflict; and proposals for enhancing Secr etariat support for strengthening United Nations cooperation with regional organizati ons. He drew attention to the initiative of the European Centre for Conflict Pr evention \u2014 in response to recommendation 27 of the report of the Secretary-General (A/55/985-S/2001/574 and Corr.1) \u2014 inorganizing regional preparatory meetings l eading to an international conference (the 2005 Global Partnership Conference on Prev ention) involving the participation of local, national and international non-governmental organizations. 24. In its discussion, the Committee emphasized the need for comprehensive system-wide responses that ensure mutual reinforcement in the political,peacekeeping, peace-building and development areas of the system's work, and theimportance, in that context, of close in teraction with the Department of Political Affairs. It was also suggested that the United Nations system would benefit frommechanisms that would systematically ch annel the political insights and information accumulated by field staff into the system's situational analysis process. In the samecontext, a political debriefing of staff evacuated from Iraq was recommended. 25. The Committee invited the Assistant Secr etary-General for Economic and Social Affairs to discuss with the Department of Political Affairs modalities for closercollaboration with HLCP and to report to the Committee's at its spring 2004 session. VII. Follow-up to the Millenni um Summit: 2005 comprehensive review of the implementation of the United NationsMillennium Declaration 26. The Committee's deliberations on the 2005 comprehensive review were pursued partly through an audiolink with United Nations Headquarters in New York.Briefing the Committee by audiolink, the Director of the Office of the DeputySecretary-General in New York noted the concern expressed by the Secretary-General over the growing polarization of the international community and7CEB/2003/7 consequently, the need for a shared vision and for realigning multilateral institutions to current realities. The Secretary-General intended to establish a \"blue ribbon\"High-level Panel of Eminent Personalitie s to assess emerging challenges, both \"hard\" (e.g., weapons of mass destruction) and \"soft\" (e.g., poverty eradication),and present new ideas for addressing them. The Panel was expected to report back tothe Secretary-General prior to the fifty-ninth session of the General Assembly. TheDirector noted that, pending the outcome of the General Assembly debate on theSecretary-General's vision and proposals outlined in his report on theimplementation of the United Nations M illennium Declaration (A/58/323), it was difficult to anticipate the implications for the 2005 comprehensive review and theassociated high-level event. 27. The subsequent discussion noted that the composition and terms of reference of the Panel and modalities for carrying out th e assessment of principal organs of the system, including the General Assembly, the Security Council, the Economic andSocial Council and the Trusteeship Council, were in the process of being finalized.The Committee noted the importance of receiving feedback on the work of thePanel, so as to monitor the implications of its work for CEB/HLCP. 28. In the light of the above briefing and the perspective presented by the Secretary-General in the above-mentioned report, the Committee continued itsreflection on the 2005 review on the basis of document CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.20.Presenting the document and the outcome of the videoconference of 10 September,the Convener of the Task Group emphasized that there was general concurrence tofocus the HLCP contribution on the three major themes of peace and security;human rights and governance; and developm ent and protection of the environment, with emphasis to be placed on interrelationships among the issues, along withspecial attention to be given to new and emerging issues in the context of recentchallenges to multilateralism. She emphasized the need to be innovative, action-oriented and forward-looking, with a view to producing an \"accountability\" reporton how the United Nations system had assisted Member States in implementing theUnited Nations Millennium Declaration. 29. The Committee concluded that the HLCP contribution to the 2005 review should take the form of a strategic document, with a similar tone as that of theSecretary-General's report. It should c onvey a sense of engagement, provide a demonstration of the system's response in managing for results across institutionalboundaries in a complex, fast-changing, external environment, highlightingachievements and success stories as well as constraints on performance. It should also contribute to initiating a process of rethinking on the work of the system in thelight of changing circumstances. 30. The HLCP contribution should be well coordinated, with ongoing work in the system, particularly the Millennium Project, and relevant work in the Bretton Woodsinstitutions, to provide a solid contribu tion for the Secretary-General's 2005 report. 31. The Committee endorsed the approach for the 2005 review as outlined in the note of the Task Group (CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.20). It agreed to establish threeopen-ended subgroups on each of the three main themes and stressed the need forclose coordination among the subgroups. It requested the Convener of the TaskGroup to consult with HLCP members to identify the lead agencies that wouldcoordinate the preparation of the HLCP contribution on each of the main themes.8CEB/2003/7 The Committee further requested the subgroups to proceed expeditiously with their work and to report to it at its spring 2004 session. VIII. The Millennium Project and the Millennium Campaign and the related work of the Unit ed Nations Development Group 32. Briefing the Committee on the Millennium Development Goals Core Strategy, the representative of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) notedthat about 40 country reports on implementation of the Goals had been completedthus far against a 2003 year-end target of 100, the delay being due to a moreprotracted process in report preparation, given the importance attached to national ownership. In the light of the compact of the Millennium Declaration, monitoringdeveloped countries' commitment remained a high priority, particularly vis-\u00e0-visgoal 8. Much effort had also gone into the clarification of the relationship betweenMillennium Development Goals reporting and poverty reduction strategy papers. Inthis connection, it was pointed out that a joint United Nations DevelopmentGroup/World Bank guidance note had been dispatched to country teams. 33. On the Millennium Campaign, the UNDP representative noted that much advocacy work was currently under way and was focused primarily on major Groupof 7 cities with respect to the attainment of goal 8 of the Millennium Development Goals. National campaigns were also taking place in the Nordic countries. Heunderlined that the Campaign was essentially a nationally driven effort supported bya United Nations core team. 34. On the Millennium Project, the representative noted that work was ongoing in all ten thematically oriented task fo rces. The intention was to produce ten monographs by the end of 2003 laying out the principal issues and themes. Ameeting was planned for 2004 to draw c onclusions on a fully consultative basis. Millennium Development Goals costing was an important issue and pilot casestudies on costing methodology were under way in seven countries. On costing, theapproach was to define gaps between available funding and needs and theidentification of potential funding sources. Th e Project Director would be presenting the thinking on this issue at a United Nations Development Group meetingscheduled for 30 October. 35. In the ensuing discussion, it was emphasized that the expert group meeting for the Millennium Project was an important foru m for the participation of agencies and that consideration should be given to lengthening the substantive session to at least afull day. The need to address linkages between the Millennium Project and work on the2005 review of the implementation of the Millennium Declaration was also stressed. IX. Communication strategy fo r the Chief Executives Board 36. The Committee had as a basis for its further discussion on the subject the background note prepared by its Vice-Chairman for its 2 July intersessional meeting.In presenting the note, the Vice-Chairman recalled that the initiative had arisen froma widely perceived need for the system to give greater collective attention tocommunication strategies for building constituencies such as for the MillenniumDevelopment Goals; for reaching out to civil society and other actors for9CEB/2003/7 implementation; for monitoring results; and for building understanding and support, externally as well as internally among staff, particularly in the context of reform. More specifically, with regard to CEB itself, the note outlined the following threeoptions: A zero approach, where the focus was strictly on communication within the United Nations system An opportunity-driven approach, in which CEB would decide to make statements to influence events as they arose A collective leadership approach, in which CEB would endeavour to project itself as the collective leadership of the global multilateral system. 37. The Vice-Chairman noted that a realistic approach at the present time might be a version of the second option. Based on the experience at the spring 2003 session ofCEB, the management of statements appe ared to be the immediate priority. More attention also needed to be given to strengthening internal communication, fosteringbetter liaison between the communications departments of the system and improvingthe CEB web site. 38. Committee members agreed that the management of CEB statements called for particular attention. Examples cited of i ssues for which joint statements could be desirable included the outcome of the fi fth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, held at Canc\u00fan, Mexico, in September 2003 and the need forrenewed commitment to multilateralism. It was noted that, in each case, the costs ofissuing joint statements, in terms of time and staff resources, would need to be weighed against their potential benefits. Other points raised included: Difficulty in getting all agencies on board when joint statements were of a political nature Need to inform the system's governing bodies before the press Need to precondition issuance of statements on the identification of a clear target audience Importance of ensuring effective follow-up to CEB statements and of developing procedures for that purpose. 39. Beyond the management of joint statements, the Committee noted that what was required was a proactive communication strategy with CEB as the embodiment of the United Nations system. The strategy should build up interest in what the UnitedNations system was collectively doing through CEB, conveying a sense of unity andcoherence in its work. The need to connect closely in this process with the United Nations Communications Group, the Department of Public Information and the Officeof the Spokesman for the Secretary-General was emphasized. The view was expressedthat, in the first instance, th e target audience should realistically be Governments and the development community, rather than, directly, the public at large. 40. The Committee requested its Vice-Chairman to develop the note further in consultation with the United Nations Communications Group and the Office of theSpokesman for the Secretary-General, and agreed to pursue consideration of the matter at future sessions. It was observed th at the outcome of the CEB retreat on the future of multilateralism was likely to pr ovide useful guidance for pursuing this issue.10CEB/2003/7 X. High-level Committee on Pr ogrammes work programme for 2003-2004 41. The Committee reviewed its work programme as contained in the report of its intersessional meeting, held in Geneva on 2 July 2003. In the light of the discussionat its current session, the Committee agreed to revise its work programme asindicated in annex VI to the present report. 42. In order to streamline its agenda, the Committee agreed that it would be useful to cluster related issues, distinguishing between issues for HLCP decision or actionand those for consideration by CEB. In keeping with its agreed working methods, the Committee would utilize, as necessary, videoconferencing to conduct its work inbetween sessions. To facilitate in-house clearance by agencies, it was alsoemphasized that documents should be submi tted well in advance of regular sessions. The need for HLCP members to consult their respective Executive Heads on issuesbefore HLCP which would feature in the CEB agenda was also stressed. XI. Autumn 2003 session of the Chief Executives Board 43. The Secretary of CEB briefed the Committee on the arrangements for theautumn session. The main items on the agenda included the outcome of the HLCPdiscussion on HIV/AIDS and financing for development and a third item onadministrative issues from the report of the High-level Committee on Management,including a meeting with staff representatives. As indicated in the Secretary-General's letter dated 18 August 2003, the CEB retreat would address the issue ofthe future of multilateralism in the perspec tive presented by the Secretary-General in his report. XII. Other matters A. Africa: New Partnership for Africa's Development 44. The Committee considered the issue of United Nations system support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) on the basis of the noteprepared by the Economic Commission for Africa, as presented by therepresentative of the regional commissions (CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.22). TheCommittee took note of a number of important developments relating to NEPAD,namely: the appointment by the NEPAD Heads of State and GovernmentImplementation Committee, of a panel of six eminent persons to support the operationalization of the African Peer Review Mechanism, acceded to by 15countries; the adoption by the General Assembly, of resolution 57/7 of 4 November2002, which provided the strategic guidance on the nature and scope for UnitedNations system support to Africa, based on the goals and priorities of NEPAD; andthe significant progress recorded by the five clusters, ranging from the drawing up of a common plan of action to the mobilization of resources and actual implementation of projects. 45. The Committee also took note of a number of events, namely: the sixth regional consultation, to be held in A ddis Ababa in early November 2003, under the11CEB/2003/7 chairmanship of the Deputy Secretary- General and which would take stock of progress and outline the next steps in strengthening United Nations systemcollaboration in support of NEPAD; and the first meeting of the high-levelCommission on HIV/AIDS and Governance in Africa, held in Addis Ababa on 16and 17 September 2003. B. Civil society organizations 46. In following up on its earlier decision to undertake a review of the state ofcollaboration between organizations of the United Nations system and civil society organizations, the Committee reviewed the out come of two events organized by the Non-Governmental Liaison Service: a meeting with non-governmental organizations/civil society organizations focal points, in March 2003, and a consultation with arepresentative group of civil society organizations in June 2003. The Committee wasalso briefed on the work of the Secretar y-General's Panel of Eminent Persons on Civil Society and United Nations Relationships (\"Cardoso Panel\"). 47. The Coordinator of the Non-Governmental Liaison Service briefed the Committee on the outcome of the consultations held in March, involving theparticipation of non-governmental organizations/civil society organizations focalpoints and liaison offices of the United Nations system, and in July, attended by over60 non-governmental organizations/civil society organizations representatives on thetheme \"The crisis in global governance: challenges for the United Nations andglobal civil society\". Among the salient issues emerging from the first consultationwere: the United Nations system's creative and positive response to growingdemands for participation from civil society organizations; the need to furtherenhance and strengthen constructive relations hips and engagement with civil society organizations, recognizing the demands fo r coordination within organizations, increased staff awareness, strong support from senior management, developingmodalities for assessing the legitimacy, acc ountability and representativity of civil society organizations and more serious United Nations system investment in thatrelationship. The Millennium Development Goals clearly provided the opportunityfor closer United Nations-civil society organization engagement, based ontransparency, mutual accountability, openness and respect for the autonomy andself-organization of civil society organizations. 48. With regard to the second consultation, the Coordinator highlighted, inter alia, civil society organization perceptions of threats to United Nations credibility, linkedin part to constraints on the independence of its Secretariat, the absence ofcompliance mechanisms to ensure implem entation of internationally negotiated agreements and the inadequate funding situ ation of the United Nations. Civil society organizations expressed concern over the granting by the United Nations ofconsultative status to neo-conservative non-governmental organizations with anti-United Nations agendas and the need fo r clarity in regulations governing the participation of the business sector. 49. On the way forward, he suggested that the system might wish to explore its potential role in bringing together like-mi nded coalitions of Governments and civil society organizations on issues of common interest. Other possible areas of futurework included the mapping out on a system-wide basis of broad generic objectivesand principles to underpin the system's engagement with civil society organizations12CEB/2003/7 and non-governmental organizations; and the possibility of HLCP holding a consultation with key civil society orga nizations and non-governmental organization leaders on efforts to implement the Millennium Development Goals. He alsoproposed that HLCP consider issues of system-wide relevance which may emergefrom the report of the \"Cardoso Panel\", with a view to identifying areas for furtherwork and action. 50. The Director of the secretariat of th e Panel briefed the Committee on the status of the Panel's work. In its meeting held on 2 and 3 June, the Panel concentrated itswork on such issues as agreeing on the context, methodology and the developmentof its work programme. Currently, work wa s ongoing, inter alia, to build a reservoir of proposals from the consultative process and discussions within the Panel,defining underpinning objectives with a view to helping the United Nations do abetter job, developing discussion on key topics, such as enhancing the role ofparliamentarians, addressing Security C ouncil issues and assessing the ramifications for governance of multi-stakeholder partners hips. The Panel would reconvene for a second meeting in December to draft possible recommendations for inclusion in itsfinal report to the Secretary-General in April 2004. The Director of the Panel's secretariat stressed the need for informa tion-sharing between the Panel and members of HLCP and noted that a meeting between members of both bodies would be useful. 51. The Committee identified a number of challenges confronting the system in its engagement with civil society organizations. These include ways of engagingoperational non-governmental organizations in the implementation of theMillennium Development Goals and other conf erence outcomes, such as that of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, overcoming the resistance of someMember States to expanded participation by non-governmental organizations inintergovernmental processes; and finding appropriate modalities for allowing thevoices of civil society to be heard in decision-making. In this regard, the view wasexpressed that the establishment of appropriate criteria on legitimacy and representativeness of civil society organizations was a precondition for progress inrelation to their participation in decision-making. The need to identify and to outlinea strategy for reaching out to civil society organization coalitions that support thework of the United Nations system was especially stressed. 52. The Committee decided to revert to the issue of civil society organizations after the completion of the report of the Secretary-General's High-level Panel, at its spring 2004 meeting. C. Indigenous issues 53. The representative of the Department of Economic and Social Affairsintroduced document CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.23. 54. In the light of the Millennium Declaration's emphasis on the issue of vulnerable groups, the Committee noted that indigenous peoples had borne the bruntof exploitation and neglect and that it was important to examine this issue from adevelopment perspective, including its cross-sectoral implications, for example, onhealth, education, well-being, environment, etc. The Committee stressed theimportance of a \"buy-in\" from Member States in the Permanent Forum onIndigenous Issues beyond the Governments that were members of the Forum, sincethe resolution of fundamental issues aff ecting indigenous peoples required the active13CEB/2003/7 engagement of all Governments. It was also incumbent on the system to reflect on how to steer the Forum to achieve rea listic and positive results. While agreeing on the development thrust, the Committee obs erved that the very important human rights issues involved should not be neglected. 55. The Committee agreed to revert to this issue at an appropriate time and, inter alia, to share experiences on how the issue was dealt with in the respectivegoverning boards of agencies. It also encour aged agencies to participate actively in the Inter-agency Support Group for the Permanent Forum. D. Follow-up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing 56. The representative of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs introduced a note on the follow-up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing(CEB/2003/HLCP/CRP.24). The Committee noted the importance of this issue forboth developed and developing countries, in the light of demographic trends and ageing populations, and underlined the need for inter-agency collaboration andfurther discussion thereon. E. Date and venue for the next se ssion of the High-level Committee 57. The Committee decided to undertake further consultation on the venue and timing of its next meeting.

Background 1. The commitments made and agreements reached at the International Conference on Financing for Development held in Monterrey, Mexico, in March 2002 encompass a holistic approach to issues of trade, development and finance, aswell as national and international govern ance. They have opened new avenues of cooperation, not only on the promotion of long-term goals of development and poverty eradication, but also on the macroeconomic dimensions of these issues. 2. The Monterrey Consensus: (a) Establishes a veritable platform for building a new global alliance for development, inclusive of relevant stakeholders; (b) Represents a new partnership between developed and developing countries with mutually shared responsibilities; (c) Is premised on full ownership by developing countries of their development and renewed commitment on the part of the international community to support their efforts. 3. Particular emphasis is placed on the need for greater policy coherence and consistency in all areas covered by the Consensus. 4. The United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have particularly impor tant roles in promoting this increased coherence and consistency in trade, fina nce and development policies. The close working relationship built during the prepara tion of the International Conference has continued and was also reflected in the preparation and outcome of the High-level meeting of the Economic and Social Council with the Bretton Woods institutionsand WTO in April 2003. This relationship is at both the intergovernmental andsecretariat levels. 5. The Conference was an inclusive process, both in terms of the number of stakeholders involved and the modalities for their participation. To build further onthis process, it was decided that all ac tors, especially the main institutional stakeholders, should \"stay engaged\" in the follow-up actions. It was also decidedthat the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council would provide themain forums for such engagement in the United Nations. The Secretary-General wasrequested to provide sustained follow-up with the United Nations system, incollaboration with the secretariats of the major institutional stakeholders concerned, and fully utilizing the United Nations System Chief Executives Board forCoordination mechanism. B. Follow-up actions at the intergovernmental levels 6. The theme for the 2003 High-level meeting of the Economic and SocialCouncil with the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization, heldon 14 April, was \"Increased coherence, coordination and cooperation for the18CEB/2003/7 implementation of the Monterrey Consensu s of the International Conference on Financing for Development at all levels one year after the Conference\". Participants generally shared the view that progress ha d been made towards increasing coherence in relation to finance, trade and development policies. The United Nations, the BrettonWoods institutions and WTO shared a common purpose and cooperative work on theMillennium Development Goals and the follow-up to the Monterrey Consensus hadintensified. At the same time, it was recognized that there were gaps inimplementation in some key areas (see President's summary (A/58/77-E/2003/62)). 7. At its fifty-seventh session, in resolution 57/250 of 20 December 2002, the General Assembly endorsed the decision by the Conference that the currentbiennial's High-Level Dialogue on stre ngthening international cooperation for development through partnership in the Ge neral Assembly would be reconstituted to become the intergovernmental focal poi nt for the general follow-up to the Conference and related issues. The first such High-Level Dialogue will be heldimmediately before the CEB session on 29 and 30 October 2003, to review the stateof implementation of the Consensus. A comprehensive report (A/57/216 and Corr.1)has been prepared with inputs and collaboration of the major institutionalstakeholders, as the main background document for the event. The present report hasbeen drawn upon to guide the HLCP preparations for the discussions in CEB,including the present annotations. C. Discussions in the Chief Executives Board 8. As indicated in the Secretary-General's letter to Executive Heads dated 18August 2003, CEB discussions at its autumn session would be preceded by the April2003 Economic and Social Council High-level meeting with the Bretton Woodsinstitutions and WTO, and by the High-Level Dialogue in the General Assemblyscheduled to be held immediately before the CEB session. They will, as such, provide a timely opportunity to share impressions on the functioning of theintergovernmental processes that have been set in motion for the follow-up tothe Conference. The Assembly has now decided to conduct a first assessment of these follow-up mechanisms at its current session, and the exchange of views atCEB could provide useful inputs for the process. 9. Intergovernmental deliberations taki ng place in other concerned governing bodies, such as those of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development,United Nations funds and programmes, the International Labour Organization, theBretton Woods institutions, the World Trade Organization and other United Nationssystem agencies, are also highly releva nt for the ongoing process of Monterrey follow-up and for keeping alive its \"multi-stakeholder engagement\" nature. Thus,they should be seen as mutually reinfo rcing tracks complementing those of the intergovernmental processes in the United Nations itself. 10. This exchange should be part of an initial, broad reflection in CEB on the impact of the International Conference on Financing for Development in advancingpolicy coherence within the system, and on approaches to advocacy, policydevelopment and coherence and policy advice and programme delivery that can maximize the contribution of the system to an effective follow-up to the Conference.In particular, CEB may wish to focus on the advocacy role of executive heads and on actions that can be taken at the \"managerial\" and inter-agency levels,19CEB/2003/7 including in particular policy advice and programme delivery at the country level. 11. The following issues have been selected in this light. The coverage isnevertheless wide, so as to enable CEB to have an overview of the range of subjects relevant to system-wide follow-up. CEB may wish to pursue some of them also in the context of other related items on the agenda of the current session, and/orgive guidance to further work within the inter-agency system, including HLCP.CEB members may also wish to take them into account, as appropriate, inconnection with their participation in the High-Level Dialogue. Mobilizing domestic financial resources The mobilization of domestic savings, both as a means of financing development and as a tool of crisis m itigation in the face of volatile capital flows, continues to be a priority. While developing and transition economieshave made progress in strengthening do mestic institutions and implementing appropriate policies to support the mob ilization of domestic resources for development, continued efforts are needed. These efforts are to be supportedby reforms in relevant areas, which include public services, building greater accountability and transparency in public administration, and implementinganti-corruption practices. In the same vein, developing countries and countrieswith economies in transition need to widen their tax bases and enhance taxcollection in order to ensure adequate revenues for public expenditure. Theyneed further efforts to put in place more effective tax administration andappropriate laws and procedures. Consideration needs to be given to ways of strengthening the impact and reach of United Nations capacity-buildingactivities in the above-mentioned areas and of creating stronger synergiesin the execution of these activities. Many bilateral aid agencies and multilateral institutions have sought to help developing and transition economies in financial sector development, rangingfrom microfinance to capital-market development. The dialogue among donoragencies on ways to enhance the effectiveness and coherence of theirassistance has been intensifying. There is also increasing recognition that moredialogue and assistance are needed. Also it is acknowledged that financialsector assessment programmes should be followed by more intensive technicalassistance to include support for self-assessments by countries in order toenable them to benchmark their financ ial sector against international best practices and evaluate the appropriatene ss of international norms for their own systems. Further consideration needs to be given to how and where United Nations system support can play the most effective role in this particular area leading to policy ownership in developing countries. Stimulating international private resource flows National and international efforts and, particularly, public and private partnerships are needed to facilitate international investment flows todeveloping countries; good examples are the partnership of the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) with the InternationalChamber of Commerce in the promotion of investment advisory councils andthe organization by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund20CEB/2003/7 (IMF) of national-level investment advisory councils in a number of countries. More is needed. The United Nations system should support further analysis toidentify proactive policies and measures in home and recipient countries offoreign direct investment that can be advantageous to development. In thiscontext, the system should assist developing countries in attracting foreigndirect investment that will enhance technology transfer and promote spilloversto domestic industry and improve the domestic value added of exports. United Nations system agencies should consid er ways in which the United Nations family could play a greater role in facilitating these partnerships andcollaborative efforts. There is also a growing need to improve the availability of information for investment and related policy formulation. International financial organizations,in cooperation with the United Nations, should seek to strengthen thecollection and dissemination of internati onal financial data. In this context, attention is invited to the growing im portance of private remittances, which largely exceed official development assistance flows \u2014 as a sources of financingdevelopment and poverty reduction. Additional efforts and more intensivetechnical assistance in this area are need ed at both the national and international levels and further information dissemination initiatives should be encouragedand supported. The United Nations system should give consideration to ways of extending enhanced support to ac tivities in this area, so as to meet in a balanced way both data collection and dissemination needs, and ensurethat technical assistance is effectively adapted to national capacities. International trade Effective and meaningful integrati on of the interests and concerns of developing and transition economies into the disciplines and operation of themultilateral trading system is integral to the Doha round of multilateral tradenegotiations and necessary to realizing th e potential of international trade as an engine for development. The emerge nce of new developing countries' groups which played a notable role at Canc\u00fan is noteworthy. CEB should assess the implications of the outcome of the Canc\u00fan Ministerial meeting and thepotential role that the whole United Nations system can play in supportingthe multilateral trading system and its development agenda, in the contextof the centrality of trade in the Monterrey Consensus. In this context, the World Trade Organization may consider ways to develop a closerrelationship with the United Nations system that can be useful for thispurpose. A number of bilateral and multilateral trade-related technical assistance and capacity-building programmes for least developed countries are beingstrengthened (Integrated Framework and Joint Integrated Technical Assistance Programme). The recently signed memorandum of understanding between theWorld Trade Organization and UNCTAD aims to further facilitatecollaboration in these areas. Consideration should be given to ways to enhance the impact of United Nations capacity-building activities in thearea of trade negotiations and to strengthen United Nations systemsupport to developing countries beyond those covered by the IntegratedFramework. In the same context, consideration should be given to ways ofstrengthening coordination of capacity-building activities geared to21CEB/2003/7 mainstreaming trade into national development strategies and expanding export supply capacity in developing countries, while also mainstreamingdevelopment considerations into the international trading system andrules framework. International financial cooperation for development and external debt The United Nations system has both an advocacy and a major operational role in promoting increased official development assistance flows and theireffective use and in ensuring that they are, in particular, directed towards theachievement of the Millennium Developm ent Goals. Consideration could also be given to the possibility of instituting aid performance indicators at therecipient country level as a mechanism for monitoring performance in terms of improvements in the quality of aid. A practical way to improve aideffectiveness and promote greater partners hip in aid relationships is to institute systems for donor performance monitoring at the recipient country level as partof the poverty reduction strategy papers process. In contributing to aideffectiveness, CEB can also help ensure progress in the harmonization ofoperations at the country level with atte ndant implications for close interaction between HLCP and the United Nations Development Group. CEB should consider how the multilateral system can better monitor and support theimplementation of the commitments made in Monterrey. With regard to harmonization, the inter-agency system should focus on: (a) concrete initiatives for cooperation on the ground in the context ofcountry-driven and country-owned poverty reduction strategies or othercore national development strategies; and (b) on how best to strengthenand deepen the different instruments of the United Nations and other major development partners, including common country assessments/UnitedNations Development Assistance Frameworks, country reporting on theMillennium Development Goals, and standardizing operations, taking intoaccount that, within the United Natio ns, the United Nations Development Group has the main operational responsibility in this matter. Renewedattention also needs to be given to ways in which the United Nations system can best help in facilitating an adequate dialogue and flow ofinformation among all aid partners, and to ways for the multilateralsystem to extend monitoring to fund ing for key \"global public goods\" that are not currently being monitored. With regard to external debt, CEB should consider and promote further work in areas that need continuing attention, such as the need to find ways to break the link between unsustainable external debt and primary commoditydependence in poor countries, further exploration of issues of general relevance to the orderly resolution of crises, the drafting of voluntary codes of conduct for application during times of crisis and the formulation andstrengthening of analytical frameworks for debt sustainability in developing and transition economies. Addressing systemic issues and staying engaged Recognizing the increased importance of faster and more automatic access to significant financial resources in times of capital-account crises, consideration22CEB/2003/7 and development of mechanisms for em ergency lending should continue in the relevant global and regional forums. Given the progress made since Monterrey in enhancing regional financial cooperation, the UnitedNations system should support, through technical assistance and advice,further efforts to supplement global arrangements with regional ones, including those aimed at strengthening mutual surveillance and peerreview and providing financial support to participating countries in timesof crisis. Strengthening global economic governance, including enhanced participation of developing countries, and the refo rms of the multilateral institutional framework required to this end have been greatly emphasized by world leadersduring the general debate at the current session of the General Assembly. Theywill undoubtedly receive focused attention at the current meetings of CEB,particularly in the context of the CE B retreat on the future of multilateralism. In the specific context of the follow-up to the International Conference on Financing for Development, CEB may wish to consider how to furtherenhance and strengthen global economic cooperation throughintersecretariat work and through the intergovernmental mechanismsdesigned in Monterrey.23CEB/2003/7 Annex IV Organizing the United Nations response to the triple threat of food insecurity, weakened capacity for governance and AIDS, particularly in Southern and Eastern Africa Summary The scale and severity of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Southern and Eastern Africa, interlinked with poverty, chronic and recurrent food insecurity, drought andweakened institutional capacity, mean that all United Nations agencies must urgently retool and scale up their support of national and community capacities to enable a multisectoral response. The purpose of this paper is to present a coherent system-wide policy and programming approach for the United Nations on HIV/AIDS with specific recommendations to be endorsed by the Chief Executives Board. After a briefintroduction, the paper summarizes the interlinkages between HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and governance (sect. II); it then identifies the paradigm shift required in the United Nations system in order to meet these new challenges (sect. III); lastly, the paper presents programmatic and instituti onal actions United Nations agencies must undertake (sects. IV and V). There are five fundamental ways in which the United Nations response must be either entirely new or radically scaled up in order to make a difference. First, results for households and communities. While the United Nations will continue to work with, and through, Governments, households and communities mustbe placed squarely at the centre of research and analysis, programme design and implementation and, ultimately, assessments in order to determine United Nations success or failure. Second, simultaneous humanitarian and development action. Given the combination of short-term shocks and l ong-term challenges associated with the crisis, the dichotomy of \"humanitarian\" and \"development\" assistance must be overcome; instead an approach should be composed of \"developmental relief\" and \"emergency development\". This approach applies equally to communities receiving traditional humanitarian assistance, such as refugees and displaced persons. Third, accelerated capacity development. Capacity-building in a broad range of sectors will be required in order to enable Governments, non-governmentalorganizations and communities to adapt to changing conditions shaped by the triple threat. Fourth, scaling up women's programming. Women and girls bear a disproportionate burden of the AIDS crisis. Programmes dedicated to the economic and social empowerment of women must be initiated and scaled up. For effective prevention, universal access to sexual and reproductive health must be ensured. Fifth, a livelihoods approach. A livelihoods approach recognizes that there is need for action at household, community, local and national levels to address AIDS within a context which is most often defined by poverty and food insecurity. A rangeof livelihood interventions are required in order to address root causes of vulnerability within a context characterized by a generalized AIDS epidemic.24CEB/2003/7 Based on these five principles and approaches, eleven programmatic actions are recommended for United Nations agencies to implement in Southern and EasternAfrica in order to achieve the targets outlined in the Declaration of Commitment (special session of the General Assembly on AIDS, June 2001) and, more broadly, the Millennium Development Goals: Action 1. Implement community safety net programmes Action 2. Improve data collection on community impact and dynamics Action 3. Strengthen livelihoods in highly affected communities and for key groups Action 4. Undertake dedicated pr ogrammes for women's empowerment Action 5. Undertake dedicated programmes to assist the growing orphan population Action 6. Undertake urgent capacity-building to fight AIDS, especially in the health sector Action 7. Undertake urgent capacity-building to deal with the impacts of AIDS Action 8. Mainstream AIDS into development planningAction 9. Build leadership to lead participatory programme reviews Action 10. Advocate and support partnership forums Action 11. Invest in monitoring, tracking and evaluation systemsTo implement these programmes, in an urgent manner which addresses simultaneously short-term needs and long- term challenges, requires a reorganization and an intensification of United Nations action. The United Nations must employ the tools at its disposal, in particular those of United Nations reform, direct its moral authority and invest managerial and financial resources to help its partners defeat the AIDS-compounded crises. Eleven institutional actions are proposed for the UnitedNations system to implement in Eastern and Southern Africa: Action 12. United Nations country teams in collaboration with Governments to review common country assessments and United NationsDevelopment Assistance Frameworks Action 13. United Nations theme groups to prepare joint implementation support plans and report annually Action 14. Review and strengthen the functioning of the United Nations resident coordinator system Action 15. In a highly affected small country, implement an accelerated vision of United Nations reform Action 16. United Nations agencies to improve skills and modalities in working with new partners Action 17. Enabling Governments to coordinate external support and ensure accountability Action 18. United Nations system, principally through the Regional Inter- Agency Coordination and Support Office, to advocate with regional bodies and Governments25CEB/2003/7 Action 19. United Nations system to advocate and work with international partners to increase investments Action 20. United Nations country teams to prepare policy and programme advocacy plans Action 21. The United Nations Development Group, in collaboration with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, to increase support and guidanceto United Nations resident coordinator system; United Nationsagency headquarters to strive to increase funding Action 22. A regional directors' group to serve as an oversight authority for United Nations action in Southern and Eastern Africa Finally, a series of recommendations are made to the CEB to endorse the actions in the paper. The declaration entitled \"Accelerating country and regional action on HIV/AIDS in Eastern and Southern Africa\" by United Nations regional directors for Africa, who met in Maputo on 9 July 2003, is attached as the appendix.26CEB/2003/7 I. Introduction 1. A new kind of humanitarian crisis is emerging in Southern Africa. It is a deadly triad consisting of a lethal epidemic, deepening food insecurity and ahollowing out of government capacity. Rural livelihoods, already challenged bypoverty, chronic food insecurity and insecure access to weakened social services, are now facing a crisis of immense dime nsions and unknown trajectory. The HIV epidemic, having reached hitherto unimaginable prevalence levels bordering on 40per cent of adults in some countries, is now entering the phase of massive deathfrom AIDS: 22,000 people are dying every we ek in the mainland Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. Fuelled in part by impoverishment andlack of essential public services, the epid emic continues to worsen, bringing in its wake new patterns of food insecurity, destitution and vulnerability. In 2002, foodinsecurity affected 14 million people in six Southern African States. Communities'ability to withstand shocks has been severely compromised. Faced with thechallenge of needing to do more to preserve lives and livelihoods, Governments ofthe region are finding that their principal asset \u2014 human resources in theirinstitutions \u2014 is being eroded at an increasing rate. 2. This structural crisis in Southern Africa has been unfolding for more than a decade. Other regions in Africa, in particular in the Horn, are starting to experiencesimilar challenges of interlinked crises . Not only are the existing financial and human resources inadequate for the task, but the policy tools for effectivelycombating HIV/AIDS and mitigating its wi der impacts are also insufficient. The crisis demands transformed \"humanita rian\" and \"developmental\" responses, including longer-term commitments and new forms of management and partnership. Priorities will have to be reoriented, fo cusing scarce public resources immediately on sustaining human life and communities. At the same, it is essential that longer-term issues be addressed immediately, so that sufficient resources are mobilized to assist with the recovery of livelihoods and ensure the provision of social service, as well as build capacity to respond to recurrent crises. The current crisis may alsopresent a window of opportunity. African Governments and the international community are determined to tackle the problem effectively, both through new ways of doing business and by unlocking new resources. 3. The purpose of the present paper is to present an overview of the interlinkages between HIV/AIDS, food insecurity and governance (sect. II); to identify theparadigm shift required in the United Nations system in order to meet these newchallenges (sect. III); and to propose a coherent system-wide policy andprogramming approach for the United Nations (sects. IV and V). The focus is onSouthern Africa, where the United Nations and its partners have been engaged for more than a decade in the struggle against AIDS and for more than a yearspecifically addressing the AIDS-food inse curity-governance triad. Proposals are made as recommended actions for endorsement by the Chief Executives Board, butit is hoped that, at the same time, the paper will inform a wider audience, includingGovernments, non-governmental organizations and international developmentpartners. The proposals outlined in the paper should be helpful for other regions ofthe world facing similar challenges. 4. A set of frameworks and initiatives already exist to guide the United Nations response in Southern Africa (see box below). The Declaration of Commitment of thespecial session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS and the Millennium27CEB/2003/7 Development Goals provide powerful guidanc e for results which must be achieved. Specific work in early 2003 on Southern Africa by the Inter-Agency StandingCommittee on humanitarian affairs and by the Joint United Nations Programme onHIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) provides fu rther direction. The goal of the present paper is to detail the programmatic activities and th e institutional changes which must be undertaken if the United Nations is to achieve the goals it has set for itself. Frameworks for action Global frameworks Millennium Development Goals adopted by the General Assembly in September 2000 Special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS Declaration of Commitment in June 2001: set goals to be achieved by 2003 and 2005 Regional frameworks African Union member States comm itted to the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and other Related Infectious Diseases in April 2001 New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) to more coherently tackle social, economic and political priorities on acontinent-wide basis, launched July 2001 Commission on HIV/AIDS and Governance in Africa, created in 2003 in response to HIV/AIDS, subregional crises and governancechallenges, chaired by the Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) Next steps for action in Southern Africa: a report of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Needs in SouthernAfrica, Inter-Agency Standing Committee, April 2003 The UNAIDS response to the AIDS crisis in Southern Africa, UNAIDS, April 2003 Southern African Development Community frameworks SADC HIV/AIDS Strategic Fram ework and Programme of Action 2003-2007: aims to reduce infections, mitigate socio-economicimpact, develop policies and legislation, and mobilize resources Maseru Declaration on the Fight against HIV/AIDS in the SADC Region, July 2003: reaffirms the commitment of SADC Governmentsurgently to combat HIV/AIDS through multisectoral strategic action National frameworks Poverty reduction strategy papers or other national development frameworks National AIDS strategic plans28CEB/2003/7 II. A different kind of crisis A. Deepening household and communi ty vulnerability to food and livelihood insecurity 5. AIDS undercuts the resilience which households and communities draw upon to cope during periods of difficulty. In the face of an external shock, poorhouseholds respond with a variety of strategies, including altering income- generating activities and consumption patte rns, as well as calling upon family and community support. But AIDS strikes at productive adults, the asset most likely tohelp during a crisis. Infected adults may be unable to work. The burden of careincreases, in both financial and social terms, for other family members. Theimpoverishment that results in all households as they use assets and savings during acrisis is amplified in HIV/AIDS-affected households. In such households, foodsecurity is undermined and children and adults tend to be less well nourished. When adults die, the remaining household may be headed by a child or elderly adult ormay even disintegrate completely. In communities where coping mechanisms arealready severely constrained, such as those composed of refugees or internallydisplaced people, AIDS amplifies that vulnerability. Although further research isrequired to determine the number of such households (which is itself complicated byan environment filled with stigma and in which people often do not know if they areHIV positive), the AIDS data which is available is staggering. More than 13 millionproductive adults in the mainland SADC region, out of an adult population ofroughly 66 million, are living with HIV and AIDS, including more than one millionchildren. There are 5 million orphans. And all of these numbers are growing. 6. HIV/AIDS also weakens communities and their governance systems. Particularly in rural areas, where pub lic services may be absent, traditional community support systems are crucial to impoverished households. But evidenceshows that HIV/AIDS weakens this critical social and economic capital. Traditionalknowledge such as locally adapted agricu ltural technologies may be gradually lost as working age adults die and leave ch ildren orphaned. Family members may grab the assets of their deceased relatives and force widows from their land. Whether inrural or urban areas, the burden of caring for sick people and orphans mayultimately overwhelm the ability or willingness of households to do more.Households and communities with fewer adu lts have less surplus adult-time to help others, undermining community resilience. In rural areas, increasingly impoverishedcommunities may receive fewer visits from traders, or suffer a reduced availabilityof services and consumer products. Just as HIV/AIDS-affected households mayultimately disintegrate, so too may HIV/AIDS-affected communities through theloss of significant numbers of their members, economic collapse and social breakdown. B. Destroying the capacity to govern and administer services 7. Most countries in Eastern and Southe rn Africa have been facing constrained institutional capacity for decades due to st ructural factors that include inadequate financial, human and technological resour ces and, especially in poorer countries, economically induced emigration of professionals. With an average of 20 per centHIV prevalence among adults in the mainland SADC countries, AIDS-related illnessand death multiply these existing problem s, compromising Governments' ability to29CEB/2003/7 meet their core mandate. Increasing AIDS-related absenteeism and death cuts the supply of human resources on the one hand, while the impact of AIDS on society changes the profile of demand, on the other. 8. On the supply side \u2014 especially in service oriented sectors such as ministries of agriculture, education, health and loca l authorities, who generally comprise the largest staff components of Governments \u2014 AIDS-related deaths reduce the quality and quantity of services. Specifically with respect to fighting AIDS, weakenedgovernment capacity obstructs its ability to undertake prevention and treatmentactivities, such as voluntary counselling a nd testing, the provision of anti-retrovirals or sexual and reproductive health services. In addition to the direct loss of skill and institutional memory, financial costs incr ease for training of new staff, increased demand for health care, funeral pay-outs and pensions. In urban areas, where local authorities have responsibility for providing services, the impact of HIV/AIDS haseroded both their income base and their cap acity to provide services. Beyond formal State systems, civil society and community organizations are also affected. But AIDS also affects demand. Critical exam ples include the growing numbers of orphans and vulnerable children who require a whole range of services; changing demographic patterns in communities that place more burdens on the elderly and children; and increased disease burden. Fina lly, the impoverishing effect of AIDS on households simply heightens the services demanded of the State and its partners. 9. For political institutions which oversee the governance process, the death of elected officials and senior members of the civil service hurts leadership capacity.Added to AIDS deaths in institutions critical to law and order, such as the uniformed services or the judiciary, it may amount to a threat to basic security, particularly incombination with other crises, such as widespread food insecurity. C. The vicious cycle 10. In a setting of poverty and chronic hunger, any external shock hitting ahousehold undermines its ability to deal with pre-existing challenges. Whether it is apoor family hit by an HIV infection, or an already-HIV affected household hit by drought, the addition of AIDS to the mix of development challenges increases thechances that households will simply not have the means to escape poverty andbenefit from development opportunities. The destruction by AIDS of humanresources of governmental and national non-governmental institutions aggravatesthe situation further. 11. More specifically with regard to the spread of HIV , the compounded crises in Southern Africa contribute directly to increased transmission. Households and communities in distress, whether due to poverty, lack of access to effective basicservices, or drought and acute food insecurity, are less likely to receive criticalinformation and services that discourage transmission of HIV . They may be lessaware of the risks of infection, and are less likely to focus on long-termconsequences of decisions in the face of immediate, household-threateningproblems. Increased migration, whether vol untary in search of income or forced seeking refuge from conflict, opens up the possibility for increased sexual encounters and abuse. 12. Women play a central role in this cycle, paradoxically both as the core of household resilience and as an actor subject to exploitation. In all countries in the30CEB/2003/7 region, women are among the poorest. Women are more vulnerable to HIV infection than men, both biologically and because of economic and social inequalities, such aslack of employment opportunities, poor access to education and information andweak control over resources. When faced with limited livelihood options, many turnto commercial and transactional sex. External shocks can make the problem worse:all six of the Southern African countries where food assistance was prioritized last year saw women and girls resorting to \"survival sex\", exchanging sex for food,money or consumption goods. 13. The poverty and food insecurity associated with the compounded crises not only exacerbates the spread of HIV , it also directly worsens its impact. It reduces theresources available to households and communities for caring for people who are ill.A lack of food and poor nutrition weaken pe oples' immune systems to all infections, including HIV . Without anti-retrovirals, other drugs to combat opportunisticinfections and good nutrition, the developm ent of HIV to full-blown AIDS and eventual death is hastened. 14. Finally, in many ways, the worst is yet to come. In 2001, an estimated 1.1 million people died in the mainland SADC region from AIDS. But the number isstill rising, and is not expected to peak until between 2005 and 2010. While moreresearch is required to better understand the \"impact wave\" of the epidemic, it is clear that the compounding effects of AIDS , external shocks such as drought, long- standing challenges of poverty, and weakened institutional capacity have created adownward spiral. The United Nations must help empower households andcommunities to escape it. III. Changing gears 15. The threat that AIDS may reverse decades of development, undermineeconomic growth and unravel the social fa bric that has held communities together during previous crises demands a re-tooli ng of United Nations responses. There are five fundamental ways in which the United Nations response must be either entirely new or radically scaled up in order to make a difference. A. Results for households and communities 16. Households and communities must be pl aced squarely at the centre of research and analysis, programme design and implem entation and, ultimately, assessments in order to determine United Nations success or failure. Given the limited resourcesand absorption capacity in the region, the United Nations system will need to focusjointly on interventions and institutions, which have the largest possible outreach(schools, health centres). While the United Nations will continue to work with andthrough Governments, the new crisis requires United Nations agencies to prioritizeengagement with households and communities the vulnerability and suffering ofwhich lie at the heart of the crisis and whos e support mechanisms must be central to the response. New relationships with Gove rnments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector are needed to help the Organization to provide better supportcommunities' governance systems and strengthen their resilience. Understandingwhy certain households and communities are more resilient than others is key to aneffective United Nations response. Placing households and communities at the31CEB/2003/7 centre of analysis and action means that the United Nations must improve its knowledge of local conditions and its sk ills and modalities to support communities. At the same time, the Organization must work to help Governments to ensure thatnational systems of governance are cha nnelling resources to and empowering community structures. B. Simultaneous humanitaria n and development action 17. The interlinked crisis of food insecurity, poverty, governance and AIDS combines recurrent, seasonal shocks (e rratic rainfall or drought) and longer term, chronic challenges (HIV/AIDS, food in security, and poverty). United Nations activities must recognize, assess and respond to the immediate humanitarian needs,such as insecure access to food, water, health care or education, caused by thecombined impact of HIV/AIDS with other shocks, while simultaneously and equallyurgently planning programmes both to reverse the accelerating erosion ofgovernment, community and household capacity and to confront food insecurity andpoverty. Both developmental relief \u2014 human itarian assistance that contributes to sustainable development \u2014 and emergency development \u2014 urgent and acceleratedassistance to aid nations in overcoming the long-term negative impact of AIDS, must be put into practice. Like traditional humanitarian assistance, the responsemust be quick and draw on international human resources to complement in-countrycapacity; and, like traditional development assistance, it must focus on capacity-building, improving existing structures and sustainability. C. Accelerated capacity development 18. Capacity-building in a broad range of sectors will be required in order to enable Governments, non-governmental organizations and communities to adapt tochanging conditions shaped by the triple threat. The application of \"emergencydevelopment\" is most critical for the building of institutional capacity, whether atnational or community level, to scale up the response to the pandemic. As noted, inhigh-impact countries, government institutions are being emptied by AIDS deaths.Not only Governments are affected; civil society is as well, hindering its ability tosupport infected individuals and affected households. D. Scaling up programmes to empower women 19. Women and girls bear a disproportionate burden of the AIDS crisis. Women are more easily infected, make up at least 59 per cent of all adults living withHIV/AIDS in the SADC region and play a ke y role in care. Girls are also caregivers and are more likely to lose development opportunities, such as being pulled fromschool as households cope. Women comprise the majority of African farmers, are the backbone of agricultural systems and are key drivers of both rural and urbaneconomies. Ongoing mainstreaming of women's issues must be continued, butprogrammes dedicated to economically a nd socially empowering women must be initiated and scaled up. Gender roles must also be addressed, looking both toempower women in their relations with me n and to work with men to promote safe sexual behaviour and a supportive envi ronment for women's empowerment.32CEB/2003/7 E. A livelihoods approach 20. A livelihoods approach recognizes that there is need for action at the household and community levels to address AI DS within a context that is most often defined by poverty and chronic food insecurity. AIDS-specific interventions canonly be successful if they are integrated with those actions designed to address the long-term causes and consequences of pove rty and related development challenges. Immediate constraints facing households, ca used by poverty and food insecurity, are a major influence on household decision-making and must be taken into account inthe fight against AIDS. The same community structures that are necessary to copewith crises and assist in the prevention, ca re and treatment of AIDS are those being weakened by poverty. A range of livelihood interventions are required, looking bothat rural areas, where the largest number of HIV-positive individuals live, wherepoverty levels are highest and food insecu rity most threatening, and urban areas, which continue to attract the migration of youth, where, percentage-wise, HIV infections levels are higher and where unemployment is endemic. 21. In the highly affected countries of Southern and Eastern Africa, the United Nations must introduce innovative and accele rated activities in these five areas. Outside of this high-impact region, wherever AIDS threatens, United Nationsagencies must consider putting in place such programmes in an anticipative andpreventative fashion. 22. Along with these five areas for innovation, three further long-standing principles underline the actions proposed in the following sections. First, there is thedevelopment principle of the respect for human rights. All actions will be designed using a rights-based approach that seeks to empower individuals and communities to achieve their rights. Second, existing structures and institutions should be built uponwherever possible, rather than creating a dditional ones. Third, in specific reference to the AIDS crisis, the principle of mainstreaming should always be applied: everydevelopment activity provides an opportunity to harness social interactions tochange behaviour to prevent and mitigat e the impact of HIV and AIDS. Fourth, effective response to halting the epidemic requires expanded efforts on prevention,treatment and care, in a mutually reinforcing manner. IV . Key United Nations programmatic actions 23. In the face of the combined crises and the challenges described in thepreceding section, United Nations agencies must review, reorient and scale uprelevant programmes to ensure that results are achieved. Global goals already exist, as presented by the frameworks listed in the introduction. The most critical are theMillennium Development Goals, which cover poverty, hunger and AIDS, and forAIDS more specifically, the Declaration of Commitment. The goals of the latter relate to halting and reversing HIV infe ction rates; ensuring access to life- prolonging treatments and care for people living with HIV and AIDS; ensuring careand protection for orphans and people made vulnerable by AIDS (including theelderly); and helping Governments to develop and operationalize strategies tomitigate and deal with the consequenc es of HIV/AIDS on human rights and development. Especially given the recent radical drop in the price of anti-retroviraltreatment, rolling-out access to these drugs ha s become key. A key supplementary goal, for example, is the WHO \"three by five\" \u2014 three million HIV positive people r eached33CEB/2003/7 with anti-retroviral treatment by 2005. The links between treatment and prevention programmes are proven, however, and both must be pursued simultaneously. 24. In order to achieve these targets at the necessary scale, the overall aim of the Organization must be to support in-country capacities, including those of national,local and community governance systems, to mount a multisectoral response. Theprogrammatic gaps in the five areas outlined in section III must be filled if scale is to be achieved and targets met. It is anticipated that the United NationsDevelopment Group in collaboration with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, through proactive support and interaction with the resident and humanitariancoordinators, will guide the overall follo w-up process, keeping CEB periodically informed on progress made in implementing the actions proposed. 25. In the Southern Africa region, significan t momentum has already been created in this direction. In July 2003, a meeting of United Nations directors for the Africaregion was organized and resulted in a declaration with specific, deliverable actions(see appendix). The programmatic actions outlined below and the institutionalreorientation presented in section VI build on these commitments in a desire toachieve United Nations system-wide endor sement of their implementation. All actions are written as recommended for Ea stern and Southern Africa, although they are pertinent wherever AIDS threatens. A. Safety nets, livelihoods and highly affected communities 26. In order to address short-term need s and long-term development challenges simultaneously, United Nations agencies must be ready to use safety netsimmediately to ensure that households have access to critical services, while at the same time assisting them to strengthen their ability to earn a livelihood. 27. Safety nets and similar programmes w ill address the short-term, humanitarian needs that require an immediate response. While they should build upon existinggovernment welfare and social programmes, in order to respond urgently they mayalso draw upon more external human resources than would normally be the case fortraditional \"development\" work. Programming should integrate local participationand ensure community control over resour ces channelled to them, and integrate capacity-building components. Temporary assistance may be required to enablehouseholds and communities to replenish th eir asset base to re-establish their productive capacity and/or access services (such as education) which may haveassociated direct or indirect costs. In other words, interventions must employ a \"developmental relief\" approach. This approach applies equally to communities receiving more traditional humanitarian a ssistance, such as those composed of refugees or internally displaced people. Action 1. Community safety nets. Work with Governments, local authorities, bilateral agencies and non-governmental development partners to provideand institutionalize programmes for income maintenance or asset strengthening for households and citizens to maintain their access toservices and/or re-establish productive capacity. Long-term socialprogrammes may be required for extremely poor households, includingthose impoverished by HIV/AIDS.34CEB/2003/7 28. Concurrent with the implementation of such activities, and in the context of the triple crisis in Southern Africa, increased research must be undertaken toimprove the understanding of the vulnerability of communities as a whole. Topicsfor needed empirical research include: (a) the long-term consequences on heavilyimpacted farming communities; (b) the quantification of households madevulnerable by AIDS (such as those head ed by children and elderly, those with increased dependency rations or those caring for sick adults and specific agegroups); (c) the impacts of gender imbalance created by increased female deaths; (d) the impact of the loss of human resources on local government, service provisionand other community structures; and (e) a better empirical understanding of the linkages between HIV/AIDS and nutriti on. Better data will improve programming, not only by revealing where help is needed, but also by illuminating howcommunities remain resilient. Higher quality information will help to determine the appropriate programming balance betwee n focusing on specifically AIDS-affected households (which may be difficult due to la ck of awareness of HIV status and/or an environment of stigma) versus addre ssing impoverished households in general. Improved knowledge, in combination with the participation of local institutions, will help ensure that programmes avoid such skewed effects as households claiming sick individuals to receive benefits. Action 2. Improved data. Expand and strengthen United Nations and partners' assessment and surveillanc e capacities in order to carry out vulnerability mapping to identify and better understand the dynamics of highly affectedcommunities. 29. Simultaneously, a longer-term, development-oriented approach will be geared principally towards increasing incomes and enhancing the food security ofhouseholds and communities. In rural areas, programmes to enhance agriculturalproduction and incomes will assist farmers, including increasing numbers of farmerswho are orphans, teenagers, widows, the elderly and women, to develop the skills,knowledge and organization that they need to access inputs, services and markets,and to establish sustainable, low-risk farming systems. Activities includemicrocredit, agricultural production and marketing programmes, use of labour-saving practices, training, employment cr eation, education and functional literacy activities, among many others. In urban areas, with the possible exception ofagricultural activities, all of these programme s are equally important, if not more so, due to the absence of land as a productive asset. In addition, access to shelter andresidential security is key to ensuring sustainable livelihood in an urban setting.Opportunities in all categories must be made available for women. Activities must be cognizant of how to help particularly vulnerable households, such as thoseheaded by children, females, those supporting sick adults or extra children, orheaded by elderly. All interventions must integrate HIV/AIDS activities, benefiting from every opportunity to fight the epidemic. Action 3. Livelihood strengthening. Target support to enable highly affected communities and women, youth and orphans, the elderly and people livingwith HIV/AIDS to enhance their ability to earn a livelihood, for example,through agricultural skills development, microfinance and vocationaltraining programmes. HIV/AIDS prevention and mitigation interventionswill be mainstreamed.35CEB/2003/7 30. Aside from targeting geographical commun ities, there are particular vulnerable and high-risk groups who require specific, tailored support. Communities must beinvolved in identifying such vulnerable groups in order to reduce the risks ofworsening their problems; insensitive targeting can unwittingly create andaccentuate stigma and discrimination. 31. Priorities include women and girls w ho bear the brunt of the social and economic impacts of the epidemic. Women do most of the caring for people livingwith HIV/AIDS and of children orphaned by AIDS. They are the backbone of foodproduction systems and are responsible for household management and chores. Gender roles impacting on sexual relations need to be addressed. Action 4. Scaling up programmes to empower women. United Nations agencies will support the Secretary-General' s Task Force on Women, Girls andHIV/AIDS in Southern Africa and review all programming to ensure thatsupport to women is scaled up for dealing with AIDS prevention andimpact and for contributing to enhanced household livelihoods. 32. Orphans are another priority group, suff ering the psychological impact of loss of one or both parents, taking on adult responsibilities for which they are notprepared, having limited entitlement to resources, such as land and even food, andreduced chances of completing their education. Young people in general are acritical target group, representing the future generation whose capacity can bedeveloped to support their extended families in this time of crisis. Action 5. Orphans. United Nations country teams in Southern Africa will review their portfolios to ensure that orphan-specific needs are covered, and thatall existing programmes are reviewed in light of a rapidly increasingorphan population. 33. For all of these actions, planners must involve organizations of people living with HIV/AIDS in design and implementation. This involvement will not only leadto more effective activities, but such pa rtners are key for fighting stigma and bolstering prevention and care efforts. B. Capacity-building to ensure prevention, care and treatment for AIDS 34. As outlined in section III above, the United Nations must move to both respond to immediate (humanitarian) need s and accelerate development assistance to help households, communities and Governments to cope. For purposes of thepresent paper, capacity-building assistance can be divided into two categories. First, assistance is needed urgently to help Governments to institute programmes andcommunities to develop responses to fight AIDS directly. Second, assistance isneeded to ensure the continuous provision of services in the face of the depletion of human resource capacity. 35. Capacity-building is required to help Governments and their partners to scale up their programmes to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and mitigate its impacts. Inthe health sector, capacity must be built to scale up and roll out the provision ofanti-retrovirals and drugs to fight opportunistic infections. A key factor in assuringaffordable access to drugs is helping countries to benefit from WTO declarations36CEB/2003/7 and decisions, such as the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Public Health declaration adopted at the WTO Ministerial Meeting held in Doha in 2001, as well as the decision adopted on 30 August 2003 by theGeneral Council of WTO. These allow countries facing AIDS and other publichealth problems with insufficient domestic manufacturing capacity to import low-cost pharmaceutical products, including active ingredients, finished products anddiagnostic kits, at affordable prices. 36. Regarding prevention, universal access to sexual and reproducti ve health services is essential given that HIV is principally spread through sexual transmission. Beyondthe health sector, every government ministry should be assessing how it can help;fighting AIDS successfully requires a multisectoral approach which covers prevention,care and treatment. This should include both the establishment of prevention, care andtreatment programmes for its own workforc e, as well as the integration of AIDS prevention activities into their regular work. In the context of chronic and recurrent foodinsecurity in Southern Africa, the providers of emergency services, just like in any othersector, must look at how AIDS activities can be integrated into their work. Thisincludes prevention, care and treatment work with refugees and displaced persons. Action 6. Capacity-building to fight AIDS. United Nations agencies, within their respective mandates, to assist with capacity-building with their partnersin all sectors to tackle the AIDS cris is, especially in the sectors of health care (including the equitable roll-out of affordable anti-retroviraltreatment and technical and legal assistance), education, ruraldevelopment and agriculture, youth programming, support to women,employment and emergency relief. 37. Beyond improving capacity to fight AIDS, capacity-building assistance is also required in all sectors to help Governments cope with the attrition of staff caused byAIDS. If societies are to avoid a collapse of services (whether in the provision ofwater, agricultural extension, health care, education or the assurance of security by uniformed corps) and an associated disappearance of development opportunities forcommunities, the United Nations with its partners must support Governments to takeextraordinary measures to bolster th e human and financial capacities of its institutions. The United Nations must support Governments to formulate andimplement new approaches such as fast-track training or national serviceprogrammes, to use adaptive strategies, such as a change in retirement ages orlabour laws, or to tap underutilized resources, such as from private institutions,academia and civil society. In line with an approach which combines \"humanitarian\"and \"development\" perspectives, immediate assessments and actions must be takento provide external help with service de livery (e.g. health care and education) in cases where populations are lacking access to basic servi ces, even while longer-term work is taken to build national capacity. Tensions between maintaining macroeconomicstability and the need for and absorption of increased resources for scaling upprogrammes should be resolved within national poverty reduction strategies. Action 7. Capacity-building to deal with AIDS impact. United Nations agencies, within their respective mandates, to assist sectoral partners counter thedevastating affects of HIV/AIDS on their human resources, and providesuch emergency assistance as is necessary to ensure the continuousprovision of basic services.37CEB/2003/7 38. Analytical gaps remain. While th ere are many sector-specific studies concerned with how the epidemic impacts upon education or agricultural extension,there are few analyses that integrate the different sectoral studies into acomprehensive, integrated framework. Furthermore, there are few if any analysestargeting the impact of HIV/AIDS on local authorities and urban governance. C. AIDS as a core development issue 39. Generalized AIDS epidemics cripple countries' efforts to achieve theMillennium Development Goals, as highlighted by declines in life expectancy ofmore than a decade in several African countries. Consequently, all principal macrolevel development instruments, such as national development plans or povertyreduction strategy papers, must include a strategy to prevent and/or mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS. In high-impact c ountries, including all of the mainland SADC countries, which have an average adult prevalence of 20 per cent, and countries inthe Horn of Africa, including Ethiopia, as well as in countries where the impact even threatens to be high, integrating AIDS activities into the principal developmentplans is a matter of urgency. Action 8. Mainstreaming AIDS into development planning. Support the efforts of Governments and their partners to take into account how AIDS affects thecontext for basic development planning (such as in poverty reductionstrategy papers), and to mainstream AIDS activities in those plans asappropriate. D. Leadership and management of the fight against AIDS 40. Strong leadership on the part of government and non-governmental actors in society is the key to an effective AIDS response. Leaders need both reliable data andopportunities to debate policy options, eval uate successes and failures and identify gaps to help inform fund-raising and programming. 41. The United Nations will undertake several programmatic actions to ensure the full participation of key groups, such as communities, people living with HIV/AIDS, non-governmental organization service providers, faith-based organizations, women,and a range of government ministries and public service agencies. United Nationsagencies and programmes will invest in improving data collection and dissemination, harmonizing, where possible, to minimize duplication, and building capacity of localpartners to undertake monitoring and evaluation activities. Locally designed, implemented and owned programmes are the mo st successful and are able to attract and absorb foreign funding effectively. It will be necessary to have an accuratecountry-by-country review of resource utilization and flows \u2014 covering the originsof funds from the United Nations system, bilateral donors and other sources \u2014 insupport of HIV/AIDS programmes. 42. By supporting the involvement of all actors in forums where such information is used, the United Nations will contribute to the transparent, democraticdevelopment and implementation of public policy on AIDS. Actions 9 to 11, notedbelow, have already been committed to by the regional directors of United Nationssystem agencies in Africa for applicati on in Southern Africa and in the Horn.38CEB/2003/7 Action 9. Leadership and programme reviews. Support leadership development programmes and country-led, broad-based participatory reviews ofnational strategic plans in order to assist Governments in identifying andaddressing implementation obstacles, capacity-strengthening requirementsand resource availability and mobilization needs. Action 10. Participatory partnership forums. Assist in the development of national and decentralized HIV/AIDS partnership forums to ensure broad-basedparticipation of public and private actors and effective coordination of theresponse. Action 11. Monitoring, evaluation and tracking systems. Assist in the development of national systems for monitoring the epidemic and tracking resourceflows and utilization to fully leverage and operationalize larger fundingcommitments from the Global Fund, the World Bank' s Multi-CountryHIV/AIDS Program and others, as well as to evaluate the impact ofprogrammes. V . A system-wide response 43. In order to implement the programmatic actions outlined above in an urgent manner which addresses simultaneously shor t-term needs and long-term challenges, requires a reorganization and an intensifi cation of United Nations action. The United Nations must employ the tools at its disposal, in particular those of United Nationsreform, direct its moral authority and inve st managerial and financial resources to help its partners to defeat AIDS. A. Building on United Nations reform 44. United Nations reform efforts led by the Secretary-General and enacted bybodies, including the Chief Executives Board (CEB), the High-Level Committee forProgrammes (HLCP) and the United Na tions Development Group provide a platform for accelerating United Nations action. An important element of United Nations reform is the attempt to rationa lize the Organization's efforts and reduce duplication. It remains a goal of the United Nations to reduce burdensometransaction costs for partners, particularly Governments. B. Common country assessment/ United Nations Development Assistance Framework 45. Together, the common country assessment and the United Nations Development Assistance Framework provide a vehicle for the United Nations todialogue jointly with government and other partners to identify how United Nationsactions will support national efforts. In the context of Southern Africa, UnitedNations country teams must use United Nations Development AssistanceFrameworks \u2014 as the country team's pr incipal \"business plan\" \u2014 innovatively so that they meet the urgent time frame a nd scaling-up requirements of Governments. This may mean reviewing common country assessments and/or United NationsDevelopment Assistance Frameworks mid-stream, or altering expected time frames,39CEB/2003/7 or integrating them with the consolidated appeals process, to ensure all needs are covered efficiently and without duplication. Action 12. United Nations country teams in Southern Africa are to review with Governments common country assessments, United Nations DevelopmentAssistance Frameworks and other relevant strategic frameworks to ensurethat United Nations resources are focused as appropriate on the AIDSepidemic and its compounding of other development challenges. TheUnited Nations Development Group or other relevant bodies to providesupport for any such reviews and assist with quality control. 46. The United Nations resident coordinator system provides a means of ensuring unified United Nations leadership and pr iority-setting, jointly addressing issues which cross agency mandates and improve transparency and accountability of theUnited Nations. United Nations theme groups can help resident coordinators to facilitate coordinated action by United Na tions agencies, and UNAIDS has learned that the presence of a dedicated staff can boost their effectiveness. The UnitedNations resident coordinator system and the common country assessment/UnitedNations Development Assistance Framework process have helped to redefine how the United Nations works at the country level, although slowly evolvingheadquarters practices do not yet sufficie ntly encourage coherent programming. The interrelated crises in Southern Africa provide, however, an opportunity to acceleratethe utilization of these tools to improve the delivery of United Nations assistance, while underscoring the need for continued strengthening of the United Nationsresident coordinator system. Experience has shown that additional capacity tosupport the resident coordinator in his or her performance of these functions is key. Action 13. United Nations theme groups on AIDS to develop immediately Joint United Nations Implementation Support Plans on AIDS in each country inSouthern Africa to assist national efforts through joint United Nationsprogramming, and pooling United Nations technical and financial resourcesfor HIV/AIDS. Plans must fit within United Nations Development AssistanceFrameworks \u2014 as the United Nation principal \"business plan\" \u2014 whichis in turn defined with respect to supporting national policies andprogrammes. Annual reports on these plans and progress will beincorporated into the resident coordinator annual reports, reviewed by theUnited Nations Development Group and UNAIDS. Action 14. Review the capacity of the United Nations resident coordinator system in Southern Africa and take appropriate actions to strengthen capacity wherenecessary. C. Small countries: opportunity fo r United Nations reform pioneers 47. Some of the most highly affected count ries in the Southern Africa region, such as Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaz iland, are small geographically and/or in population. Despite the damage to deve lopment caused by the AIDS-compounded crisis, they tend to receive less investment by the United Nations agencies, in termsof staff and resources, due to their small size. To address this problem, it is proposed that United Nations reform in its most visionary form be implemented in one ormore of these small countries.40CEB/2003/7 Action 15. In one highly affected small country, to be recommended by the United Nations Development Group, consider implementing an acceleratedversion of United Nations reform by establishing, on a pilot basis, a singleUnited Nations office hosting multiple agencies, allowing for joint programming of HIV/AIDS funding, and consolidating cooperationframeworks. The pilot initiative woul d be evaluated before replication. D. Better partnerships to ex pand the national response 48. In order to work quickly addressing bot h short-term and long-term needs, and to ensure that households and communities are at the centre of analysis and action,the United Nations must improve its ability to work with civil society andcommunity organizations. Modalities of implementation must include, but gobeyond, Governments as partners. The United Nations, using its unique space in thedevelopment community, must use its authority to bring together different actors,including Governments, bilateral agencies, international and national non-governmental organizations, the private sector, academic institutions, religiousbodies and other community organizations. The United Nations should focus moreof its capacity-building, technical assistance and financial resources on these actors.Support to these institutions will also help bolster capacity gaps in government. Action 16. United Nations agencies must increase their skills and establish modalities to build partnerships with local organizations to better accesscommunities and households and to facilitate dialogue and joint planningacross governmental and non-governmental sectors. E. Efficient coordination 49. Management of the relationships with numerous development partners, each of whom often desires individual agreements and implementation arrangements, further burdens Governments' overstretched huma n and financial resources. United Nations reform is designed to reduce this burden, with regard to government relations withthe United Nations, by unifying and rationalizing United Nations planning. TheOrganization should also use its position and authority to encourage a rationalizationof agreements, negotiations, resource m obilization efforts, committees, reporting requirements and monitoring and evalua tion programmes of all development partners. In order for the United Nations to be in a position to use its influencecredibly, a strong theme group on HIV/AIDS and adequately staffed offices withexpertise on AIDS are essential. The experience of UNAIDS, whose field staff havehelped make United Nations theme groups on HIV/AIDS a success, should belearned from and built upon. High-quality common country assessments and UnitedNations Development Assistance Frameworks will also help by serving to bring together partners around common objectives, thus facilitating common proposalsand implementation modalities. 50. A key opportunity in the case of the crisis in Southern Africa is the consolidation of committees involved in resource mobilization and the scaling up ofnational multisectoral responses to AIDS. To the extent possible, the United Nationsshould work to support government leadership of a single rational, participatorycommittee structure which can efficiently manage funds mobilized from the Global41CEB/2003/7 Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank's Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Program and bilateral donors. Action 17. United Nations agencies, through the United Nations resident coordinator system, United Nations Theme Groups on HIV/AIDS and individualagencies, to support Government efforts to rationalize structures tomanage and coordinate partners' efforts. Government capacity should bebuilt and mechanisms supported to better coordinate donor programmingand investments and promote accountability. F. United Nations country and regional advocacy 51. A number of United Nations agencies are already engaged in a range ofinformation and communication activities de signed to increase awareness, prevent the transmission of AIDS and facilitate acc ess to services to mitigate its impact. Many are focused on youth. Other agen cies are focusing their communications efforts on poverty and livelihoods. These important sector-specific activities mustremain core programmatic work of the United Nations. 52. In addition, the United Nations must also engage in advocacy targeted on influencing the policy environment. The Organization has an opportunity, given itsmandate, to articulate and promote polic y positions, based on research, to promote the achievement on an individual, household and community level of the rightsoutlined in the Charter of the United Nations and United Nations agreements, suchas the Universal Declaration of Hu man Rights and the General Assembly's Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. At the country level, United Nationscountry teams must similarly use their combined moral authority and neutralpositioning to develop integrated policy advocacy plans, based on research andstrategic information. Action 18. Principally through the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination and Support Office and supported by individual agency efforts, the United Nationsshould undertake advocacy with regional bodies, including SADC, NEP ADand the African Union, to ensure Government commitments to address theAIDS-compounded crises in a coordinated way. Action 19. The United Nations should undertake advocacy with international partners, including donor-nation Governments and multilateralinstitutions to promote coordinated investment, increased financing tofight the triple crisis facing Southern Africa and threatening otherregions, accelerated debt relief, the easing of macroeconomicconditionalities in the light of the crisis, and the scaling up of AIDSprogrammes, including access to affordable treatment. Action 20. United Nations country teams should develop informed advocacy plans to utilize strategic information for ongoing advocacy on key national issuessurrounding HIV/AIDS (such as access to treatment, women' s issues, HIVprevention centring on young people, and orphans and vulnerablechildren' s issues) and how it compounds other development challenges.42CEB/2003/7 G. Headquarters, regional and fiel d management of commitments 53. In order to achieve the objectives and implement the programmatic actions outlined in the present paper, United Nations agency resources must be secured,invested at the country level and managed accountably. 54. First, clear directives and resources must come from headquarters and regional offices. Directives are helpful to country offices because they provide a mandate tocountry representatives to review and reor ient existing plans. However, headquarters instructions alone, without resources to back them up, is a formula for failure.Moreover, United Nations actions and levels of investment at the country level must be made transparently. 55. Second, in regions where the confluence of AIDS with other crises threatens multiple countries, regional leadership mechanisms can focus management attentionand ensure accountability. Regional directors, with line responsibility over countryprogrammes, have the requisite authority to be accountable for results. In SouthernAfrica, for example, regional directors from the United Nations system haveconstituted themselves as a responsible body to oversee deliverables listed in theirdeclaration following a meeting held on 9 July 2003 in Maputo. This group will besupported by an multi-agency regional office, based upon the existing RegionalInter-Agency Coordination and Support Office and the UNAIDS Inter-CountryTeam. This multi-agency office will organize periodic meetings of the regionaldirectors, monitor the activities of the United Nations system in the region, preparereports for the regional directors on progress or obstacles, share information anddocument case studies for rapid dissemination and provide a consistent interlocutorfor regional bodies, such as SADC. Action 21. In collaboration with the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, and utilizing the experience of the Regional Inter-Agency Coordination and SupportOffice, and the United Nations Development Group should provide directoperational support and guidance to resident and humanitariancoordinators to ensure a coordinated response to AIDS-compoundedcrises, and United Nations agency headquarters should strive to provideincreased funding. Action 22. A regional directors' group which met for the first time in Maputo in July 2003 should continue to serve as an oversight authority in Southern Africaand the Horn of Africa to provide United Nations leadership and assureaccountability for United Nations action. They will rely upon the RegionalInter-Agency Coordination and Support Office (or its successor) as asecretariat to support their responsibilities and represent the group ofdirectors regionally on AIDS and related issues. VI. Actions by the Chief Executives Board 56.

We commit ourselves to a major intensification of United Nations support for national HIV/AIDS responses in the re gion, as well as firmly and explicitly centring HIV/AIDS within the humanitarian and development work of theUnited Nations system in Southern Africa and the Horn of Africa. We commit ourselves to ensuring that the United Nations system role is strategic, that it directly responds to the national priorities in countries, andthat it addresses the capacity constraints critical to their successfulimplementation. In particular, we commit to developing country-level, jointUnited Nations implementation support plans to support national efforts, andwe commit to providing annual reports by United Nations theme groups onachievements against these plans. We commit ourselves to working with Governments and regional bodies, such as the Southern African Development Community, the Commission onHIV/AIDS and Governance in Africa and the New Partnership for Africa's Development to develop more effective short, medium and long-term strategiesto respond to the HIV/AIDS crisis and to support the findings of the High-Level Committee on Programmes (HLCP) on the nexus of HIV/AIDS,governance, and food security. In this respect, we commit ourselves to reinforcing the United Nations system and to investing the necessary financia l and human resources to strengthen our overall capacity to confront the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the region. We agree to the following key deliverables to intensified and unified United Nations action: We commit ourselves to defining a limited number of objectives and measurable \"United Nations system deliverables\" need ed to focus leadership attention and support, to catalyse further action, and to respond to partner expectations anddemands of the United Nations system as a whole in each country in the region. We commit ourselves to improving the monitoring and evaluation of United Nations country-level performance, including the development of an accountabilitymechanism for United Nations theme groups on HIV/AIDS. We propose the following actions for achievement by the United Nations system (in collaboration with Governments and partners) in Southern Africa and the Horn of Africa region by the end of 2004:45CEB/2003/7 We commit to supporting country-led, br oad-based participatory review of national strategic plans in order to assist Governments in identifying andaddressing implementation obstacles, capacity strengthening requirements andresource availability and mobilization needs to address short-term and long-term development and humanitarian challenges. We commit to developing joint United Nations implementation support plans to assist national efforts through joint United Nations programming, poolingUnited Nations technical and financia l resources, and using common country assessments, the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, theMillennium Development Goals and other development instruments, includingthe poverty reduction strategy papers. We commit to assisting the development of national systems for monitoring the epidemic and tracking resource flow a nd utilization to fully provide leverage and operationalize larger funding commitments from the Global Fund to FightAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank's Multi-country AIDSProgram, and others, as well as evaluating the impact of the programmes. We commit to assisting the development of national HIV/AIDS partnership forums to ensure broad-based participation of public and private actors andeffective coordination of the response.

Introduction 1. The present report is prepared pursuant to the decision of the intersessional meeting of HLCP, held in Geneva on 2 July 2003, which called for specific proposals on collaborative arrangements in four areas of follow-up to the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development: (a) Freshwater and water and sanitation; (b)energy; (c) oceans and coastal areas; and (d) changing unsustainable patterns ofconsumption and production. The meeting approved elements of a proposed workplan for follow-up to the Summit. a The Committee endorsed a function-based approach with emphasis on implementa tion, greater integration in follow-up programmes and actions, while underlining the need for reduction in transactioncosts for coordination and for drawing upon the experience of past coordinationmechanisms. b 2. In developing proposals for inter-agency collaborative mechanisms, due regardneeds to be given to ensuring that these provide enhanced support to Governmentsfor country-owned implementation of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation;effective links to the normative work with operational activities; strengthening implementation at the regional level; foster partnerships and inclusive approaches;and promote greater synergies among the work of the organizations of the system aswell as ensuring integrated approach to not only follow-up to the World Summit onSustainable Development but also that of other conferences and the Millennium Declaration. a II. Background 3. At its spring 2003 session, held in Paris on 25 and 26 April, CEB concurredwith the overall approaches to the follow-up to the Summit developed by HLCP. Itasked the Committee to elaborate further its recommendations and focus its work onthe substance of the follow-up. This will help to ground modalities for inter-agencyand other collaborative arrangements, as well as the policy guidance to be providedfor technical work and operational activities and further strategic discussions on thematter, in substantive objectives and tasks. c 4. CEB highlighted the need for: coherence and consistency, at the operational,regional and global levels, and str ong linkages among those levels; country ownership of the follow-up process, coordination support for capacity-building andfull use of existing country-level mechanisms; a focus on sustainability andproductivity and on natural resources as the engine for sustainable growth; greaterattention to the regional dimensions of the follow-up to the World Summit onSustainable Development, given the growing need for cooperation on issues that cutacross national borders; implementation to be linked to the broader processes of integrated follow-up to United Nations conferences and summits, in particular theMillennium Summit; and HLCP to assist in identifying ways of streamlining parallel processes and duplicative reporting.48CEB/2003/7 III. Inter-agency collaborative mechanisms 5. HLCP approved, in principle, a set of considerations that should guide the development of inter-agency coordination/collaborative arrangements for aneffective and integrated framework for follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development. These broad principles included focusing onimplementation at all levels (global, regional and national); placing the Summitwithin the context of broader summit/c processes; taking into account the two-year \"implementation cycles\" set out by the Commission onSustainable Development for reporting requirements; taking into account and, ifneed be, building upon existing coordination arrangements; and the decision of theCommission to avoid creating standing subsidiary bodies, using new innovative andflexible modalities. d 6. The Committee had also considered the generic objectives for future inter-agency mechanisms. These include: e \"Advocacy/public profile: promoting pub lic profile of the issues through outreach to media, advocacy campaigns and the active involvement of a broadrange of actors. Clearinghouse: serving as a clearinghouse for policy and programme information exchange, and for sharing lessons learned and experiences. Thiscould include preparation of a comprehensive annual report providing anassessment of the state of play. While this should be approached as acontinuing function, the conveying of speci al annual meetings of all relevant actors, including bilateral donors, may prove desirable for sharing informationand future plans. Policy coherence/development: promoting policy coherence at all levels in line with the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation and identifying specific areaswhere there is a need or opportunity for further policy development. Promoting collaboration among actors: enco uraging and facilitating collaborative arrangements in relation to programme s and projects among relevant actors, in order to avoid duplication and ensure optimal utilization of resources. Strengthening the knowledge base: establishing linkages among and with research centres, institutes, networks and other sources of knowledge related to a particular sector. Encouraging linkages: serving as a link between global, regional and national level activities. Capacity-building: supporting initiatives for capacity-building in developing countries. Monitoring and evaluation: evaluating progress towards the achievement of goals or targets and harmonizing the reporting formats\". 7. The United Nations system has pursued a number of different approaches to promote inter-agency collaboration. Some of these are summarized below: (a) Single lead agency designated by the system to provide leadership focus for other cooperating agencies. Examples are: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations-led United Nations Atlas on the Oceans; United Nations49CEB/2003/7 Environment Programme-led Global International Waters Assessment (GIWA); and UNESCO-led United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development(2005-2014); (b) A group of agencies that have comparable levels of expertise in a specific area working through a coordinating body. An example is the Joint Group of Expertson the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection (GESAMP); (c) Agencies agree to establish a jo int programmatic arrangement which provides the overall focus and impetus for th e actions to be taken on behalf of the co-sponsoring agencies Joint United Na tions Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS); (d) Issue management approach, where time-bound groups or teams comprising all relevant institutions are set up with a mandate to develop recommendations and proposals on a specific issue. The Environmental Management Group is followingthis approach for environmental issues in the context of the follow-up to the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development; (e) Setting up country-level processes fo r coordinated implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit and other conferences' follow-up processes. TheUnited Nations Development Group pursues this approach at the country level. 8. While looking to future collaborative mechanisms in the United Nations system, it is noted that, when CEB decide d to streamline its subsidiary machinery and discontinue its standing bodies, it made clear that the intention was not todiscourage inter-agency collaborative work in specific areas. Rather, the idea was toenable CEB and its new high-level committees to concentrate on key policy issuesand matters of strategic concern, freeing it from having to deal with technical issues and numerous reports from the standing bodies for which the Executive Heads hadlittle time to carry out a realistic review. At the same time, it was felt that moredynamic methods were needed to ensure co ncrete progress in the different areas of inter-agency concern beyond the United Nations system, involving new stakeholdersand other key external partners. Executive Heads continued to attach importance tothe need for effective coordination in many areas, but were encouraging a moreflexible and function-based approach to replace formalistic and bureaucratic machinery. Thus, the four areas addressed in the present report are approached in thespirit of the CEB decision and with the objec tive of attaining the goals and targets in each of these sectors. 9. The above information is provided to assist the Committee in considering future collaboration in the United Nations system and, where specific mechanismsare promoted, serve as guiding principles fo r their terms of reference and functions. 10. The sections under Freshwater and energy in the present report have been slightly expanded to provide a more detailed analysis of substantive issues in thoseareas. Since the United Nations system and its partners have only recentlycompleted comprehensive studies in both these areas, namely, The United Nations World Water Development Report f and The World Energy Assessment: Energy and the Challenge of Sustainability Energy Study ,g the report draws on their findings so as not to duplicate efforts and to build upon work already accomplished, includingby the Open-Ended Group of HLCP on follow-up to the World Summit onSustainable Development.50CEB/2003/7 A. Freshwater and water and sanitation 11. Freshwater. Beginning with Mar del Pl ata Action Plan (1977), which later led to the International Drinking Water and Sanitation Decade (1981-1990), the International Conference on Water and Environment (1992) and the United NationsConference on Environment and Development (1992), the World Water Forum, theMillennium Summit (2000) and the World Summit on Sustainable Development(2002), the international community has tried to identify the political, economic,ecological, social and strategic challenges related to freshwater and to developapproaches on how to address these challenges. 12. The World Water Development Report: Water for People, Water for Life , launched in 2003 by the United Nations World Water Assessment Programme, is akey success story of the United Nations system. It has also helped in crystallizingthe challenges of freshwater which include meeting basic needs, securing the foodsupply, protecting ecosystems, sharing water resources, managing risks, valuingwater, governing water wisely, monitoring industrial usages of water, assessingwater and energy needs production, ensuring the knowledge base and assessingwater in the cities. 13. There is a general view that the water crisis faced by the global community is mainly one of mismanagement of water resources and its cascading impact on thelives of world's inhabitants. The World Water Development Report h considers the issue of distribution of water as anot her challenge \u2014 overabundance of water in some regions and serious shortage in others \u2014 and is calling for pricing water moresensibly to reflect the costs of providing it (including environmental costs), as wellas its marginal utility. The case for priva tization, however, is seen as being flawed when it comes to developing countries and where it would imply a serious increasein water tariffs \u2014 a burden on the already impoverished population and among otherreasons, politically unacceptable. 14. There is no panacea for dealing with issues of governance and distribution. Thus far, there is no single model, public, private or a combination of private andpublic, that can be identified as being idea l for all situations. Experience has been mixed and the key to a successful public/private partnership, as made clear in the World Water Development Report , is to have \"good governance and the right institutional framework, notably effective regulation\". 15. Major international events, in par ticular the Rio Summit, the Millennium Summit, the World Summit on Sustainable Development, the Third World WaterForum and the publication of the World Water Development Report have not only drawn the attention of Governments, the United Nations system, internationalfinancial institutions, business and industry, non-governmental organizations andcivil society to these challenges. They have also helped in generating international consensus to deal with them in the broader context of sustainable development,poverty eradication, health, education a nd capacity-building, economic and social development and a host of other economic, social and environmental factors. 16. According to Agenda 21, adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, \"Water is needed in all aspects of life. Adequatesupplies of water of good quality should be maintained for the entire population ofthis planet, while preserving the hydrologi cal, biological and chemical functions of ecosystems, adapting human activities within the capacity limits of nature and51CEB/2003/7 combating vectors of water-related diseases\". The Millennium Declaration commits Governments to halve, by the year 2015, th e proportion of people without access to safe drinking water. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation not only reaffirmed theMillennium Declaration goal, but also added the issue of access to basic sanitation. Itadopted four major objectives with regard to water, namely, (a) halve, by the year 2015, the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinkingwater and the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation; (b)develop integrated water resources manage ment and water efficiency plans by 2005; (c) develop programmes for mitigating the effects of extreme water-related events; and (d) establish and/or develop national monitoring networks and water-relateddatabases. 17. To move forward on the water agenda emanating from the Summit's Plan of Implementation will require political will a nd major policy shifts by Governments. An effective response from all stakeholders , and in particular by the United Nations system, to the four objectives mentioned above, is essential. For the United Nationssystem, it is critical to formulate strategi es for the effective follow-up to the Summit and to ensure the implementation of existing agreements within the agreed-upontime frames. The United Nations system must also contribute constructively to theprogramme of work of the Commission on Sustainable Development and its sessionsin 2004 and 2005, which will focus on water, sanitation and human settlements. 18. The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation calls for effective coordination among various international and intergovernmental bodies and processes working onwater-related issues, both within the United Nations system and between the UnitedNations and international financial institutions, drawing on the contributions ofother international institutions and civil society to inform intergovernmentaldecision-making; and promoting close coor dination in developing and implementing activities related to the International Year of Freshwater, 2003 and beyond. 19. Within the United Nations system, water is dealt with by a number of specialized agencies, United Nations programmes and other United Nations entities.Implementation of the complex and ambitious international agenda is, therefore, a collective responsibility and challenge, beginning with the United Nations system,but also involving progressively other \"non-traditional\" partners and stakeholdersinto a global, comprehensive effort. 20. There are important implications for the United Nations system that need to be addressed as a matter of urgency, especially taking into consideration the need tosupport and actively participate in the work of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment. Prior to the reform of the Administrative Committee on Coordination in 2001, its Subcommittee on Water Resources played a key role in ensuring UnitedNations system-wide coordination and c ooperation. This Subcommittee, like other ACC subsidiary bodies, was discontinued in favour of new, flexible and substance- driven arrangements for inter-agency coordination. 21. Since 2001, the members of the former Subcommittee have continued to informally coordinate their activities. In October 2002, immediately after the Johannesburg Summit, this informal arrangement became known as \"UN Water\" andbrought together the senior managers of the water programmes of 24 United Nations system entities. It was responsible for the preparation and publication of the firstedition of the World Water Development Report in March 2003. UN Water's World Water Assessment Programme, of which the World Water Development Report is a52CEB/2003/7 part, was created to provide the kind of global water assessment and policy advice called for by the Summit and the Commission on Sustainable Development at itseleventh session. Its priorities are to lay the basis for implementing system-wideactivities in support of the Plan of Im plementation, the Millennium Development Goals concerning water and sanitation, and to support the work of the Commission. 22. UN Water should be able to manage ne w partnerships with the main actors outside the United Nations system, such as the Global Water Partnership, the WorldWater Council, the Water Supply and Sa nitation Collaborative Council and the World Conservation Union, and the private sector. A number of donors have alreadyindicated their willingness to establish operational relations with UN Water tocontribute to implementation of the gl obal water agenda through country-level solutions. It has already constituted a subgroup that deals specifically with sanitationissues and will shortly add a second on capacity development. It has alsoincorporated a task force on gender and water. Decision No. 1 The Committee confirmed UN Water as the inter-agency mechanism for follow-up of the World Summit on Sustainable Development water-related decisionsand the Millennium Development Goal concerning freshwater; requested it to finalize, before the end of 2003, its term s of reference and modalities of work, including arrangements for progressive a nd effective participation of non-United Nations actors in the World Summit on Sustainable Development follow-up, bearingin mind the guiding principles and functions established by the High-LevelCommittee on Programmes. Decision No. 2 The Committee requested the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction to inform HLCP on progress achieved in developing programmes, in cooperation with UNWater as may be necessary, for mitigating the effects of extreme water-relatedevents (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation, para. 26 (d)). 23. Water and sanitation. As stated earlier, the Plan of Implementation envisaged halving by the year 2015, the proportion of people who do not have access to basicsanitation. To this end, the Plan underlined the need for action in developingefficient household sanitation systems; improving sanitation in public institutions,promoting safe hygiene practices, prom oting education and outreach focused on children, promoting affordable and socially and culturally acceptable technologiesand practices; developing innovative financing and partnership mechanisms andintegrating sanitation into water resource s management strategies. The Plan also highlighted the need to support capacity-building for water and sanitationinfrastructure and services development and to promote technologies for safe water,sanitation and waste management for rural and urban areas. 24. In addition to these areas for action, water and sanitation is also seen as a complex governance issue that is critical for urban basic services with social (healthand education), economic (poverty eradica tion) and environmental (water quality, ecosystem and aquifer protection) dimensions. There is now a better understandingof the key urban governance issues, which affect delivery and performance of urbanbasic services. The issues of decentralization of government functions to local levelsand the importance of involving local communities in operation and management of53CEB/2003/7 services at neighbourhood level have also been recognized. Attention must also be given to the interlinkages with health issues, population and the role of women inmanaging water resources. The priority is now to shift to mainstreaming these concepts into national policies and legisl ation and demonstrating the validity and sustainability of these approaches thr ough well-conceived programmes and projects at the local level. 25. Some of the policy priorities that ha ve emerged in this context from the ongoing intergovernmental and inter-agency consultations, through technical assistanceto national and city governments, are improving governance of basic services; servicesfor the poor; promoting innovative financing mechanisms (encouraging privatesector to invest in urban basic services, including in the water and sanitation sector); enhancing livelihood and environment linkages in urban basic services, greater focus oninformation, advocacy and communication; collaboration with the private sector,international financing institutions in cluding strengthening partnership between organizations of the United Nations system and the World Bank, as well as the regional development banks; and finally, monitoring and evaluation based on a strong inter-agency partnership in monitoring improvements in the living conditions of slum-dwellers around the world. UN Water seems well placed to deal with these issues. Decision No. 3 The Committee requested UN Water to prepare a detailed plan, through its subgroup on sanitation, for an effective follow-up to the World Summit onSustainable Development and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation in the fieldof water and sanitation linked to the work related to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals and the United Nations Millennium Declaration. B. Energy 26. Building on the outcome of the ninth session of the Commission onSustainable Development, the World Summ it on Sustainable Development identified five key areas as critical to achieving the goal of energy for sustainabledevelopment. These areas include: (a) Increasing access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound energy services and resources. Two billionpeople lack access to modern energy services. Continued reliance on traditionalfuels and technologies brings hardships, health problems and ecological strains; (b) Improving energy efficiency. The potential for more efficient energy use is enormous, since overall global energy efficiency is estimated at 37 per cent. Manyenergy efficiency gains have already been realized, especially in centralizedprocesses, for example, power stations. A large unrealized potential for greaterenergy efficiency exists at the point of end-use, for example, through more efficientvehicles, appliances and buildings. Gains in energy efficiency of 25 to 35 per centare achievable in industrialized countries over the next 20 years, with higherpotentials of 30 to 45 per cent in developing and transitional economies witheffective policy measures to encourage energy conservation; (c) Increasing the proportion of energy obtained from renewable energy sources. Renewable energy (biomass, small hydropower, wind, solar, and54CEB/2003/7 geothermal energy) contributes just 2 per cent of global energy supplies. The future prospects for renewables are dependent on an enabling policy environment,including the phasing out of subsidies for fossil energy and factoring in theenvironmental costs into the price of energy; i (d) Diversifying energy supply through advanced, cleaner, more efficient, affordable and cost-effective energy technologies. Accelerated development,deployment and diffusion of new energy technologies is critical for meeting thechallenges ahead. Continued technological adva nces are needed in all aspects of the energy system, especially in renewables, energy-efficiency and fossil fuelutilization. Advanced nuclear energy technologies could play a role in decarbonizingthe world energy system but only if public concerns about reactor safety,proliferation and waste disposal can be sa tisfied. Increased investments in research and development in both the public and priv ate sectors are essential to meeting the challenges of energy diversification for the future; (e) Implementing transport strategies for sustainable development. Access to clean, safe and efficient transport servi ces is essential to meeting the Millennium Development Goal of reducing poverty as well as improving urban air quality,improving health and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The transport sector is thefastest energy-consuming sector and energy-linked emissions pollute and degradethe environment and produce adverse health effects (some 3 million prematuredeaths per year, equivalent to 5 to 6 per cent of global mortality). About 78 per centof human-caused carbon dioxide emissions are linked to fuel combustion. In cities inthe developing countries, the most pressing need for pollution control is to reduceand eventually eliminate small and medium-scale combustion of dirty fuels. 27. A whole range of goals and targets has been agreed in these five areas. At the ninth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, and more specificallyat Johannesburg, Governments underlined th e significance of increased investment in energy activities in the pursuit of sustainable development. It was also recognizedthat this would require contributions from all stakeholders. This point wasreinforced in the preparations of Johannesburg with an emphasis on partnerships,with a view to bringing together major stakeholders to more effectively supportactivities related to energy for sustainable development. 28. It is widely recognized in the United Nations system that the issues of energy use and efficiency are closely linked with climate change. The mandates of theUnited Nations Framework Convention on C limate Change are essential for future work in this area and should thus be taken into account. 29. The economic, social and environmental goals of sustainable development as expressed in the United Nations conferences and summits of the 1990s cannot beachieved unless energy is produced, distributed and utilized in fundamentallydifferent ways in the future. In this cont ext, emphasis needs to be placed on the development and application of new and renewable sources of energy. An appropriate mix of public policies and private sector incentives, complemented byefforts at the local, national, regional and international levels, are essential to achieving a sustainable energy future. The policy options include: (a) removal ofsubsidies to conventional fuels; (b) rational pricing approaches that reflect socialand environmental costs associated with various forms of energy use; (c)complementing market approaches with regula tory measures to protect public benefits;55CEB/2003/7 (d) encouraging technological advance at every stage of the energy innovation chain; and (e) supporting technological leapfrogging in developing countries. Existing capacity of the United Nations system 30. The work of the United Nations system in the area of energy covers a wide array of activities. Members of the United Nations system working in the field ofenergy include the Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the United NationsConference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the United NationsEnvironment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), theUnited Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Bank, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the United NationsIndustrial Development Organization (UNIDO), and the International AtomicEnergy Agency (IAEA). The United Nations regional commissions also havesignificant energy activities. Most of the activities of United Nations systemorganizations at the country level focus on improved energy efficiency, renewableenergy and clean fossil fuel technologies, including through support for capacitydevelopment and policy dialogue. 31. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs supports the work of intergovernmental bodies, in particular the Commission on Sustainable Developmentand the Economic and Social Council, and car ries out technical assistance activities in several countries, in addition to analytic reports on specific energy topics. It alsoplays a key role in the follow-up to transport-related issues within the UnitedNations system. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNEP, alongwith the United States Environmental Protection Agency, are partners in the WorldSummit on Sustainable Development Partnership for Clean Fuels and Vehicles, whichhas attracted more than 50 partners from the private sector, the non- governmental organization community, Governments and international and regional institutions. 32. IAEA has been engaging in building capacity in overall energy-environment planning. The Agency develops and tran sfers energy-environment planning models tailored to the special circumstances of particularly developing country Member States. It transfers the latest data on technologies, resources and economics; health and environmental impacts, trains local experts; jointly analyses national options;and helps to establish continuing local planning expertise. The Agency currentlyleads World Summit on Sustainable Development Type-2 partnerships on Indicatorsfor Sustainable Energy Development and on Country Profiles on Sustainable EnergyDevelopment. 33. UNDP supports country-level capacity-building for energy focusing on upstream policy dialogue, access to rural energy services, low emissions tec hnologies and new energy financing mechanisms. UNDP also works directly with community groups onenergy through its participation in the Global Environmental Facility and supportsglobal advocacy on energy and poverty linkages, in line with the MillenniumDevelopment Goals. Along with the World Bank and UNEP, UNDP is one of theimplementing agencies under the Global Environmental Facility, the largest sourceof grant financing for clean energy projects aimed at mitigating climate change. 34. UNESCO has been involved in promoting renewable energies since 1952, beginning with the UNESCO Arid Zone Programme. It organized the firstinternational solar energy congress in 1973, as well as a high-level expert meeting in56CEB/2003/7 1993 on the potential of all forms of renewable energies (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, tidal, ocean, etc.) and thei r applications. Subsequently, UNESCO initiated in 1996 a World Solar Summit that led to the World Solar Programme1996-2005. UNESCO is also involved in promoting technical demonstration andcapacity-building projects. A notable example is its Global Renewable EnergyEducation and Training Programme, which ai ms at advocacy for renewable energies, mobilizing functions in raising awareness and promoting sustainable use ofrenewable energies, provision of related policy advice, capacity-building,development of competent human resources geared to improve the use, maintenanceand management of renewable energy projects, as well as transfer of technologicalknow-how. 35. UNEP undertakes analysis on energy's links to environmental degradation, including climate change, local and regional air pollution issues. It helps to developapproaches addressing the environmental dimensions of energy policies andsupports the UNEP Collaborating Centre on Energy and Environment. As follow-upto the World Summit on Sustainable Development, UNEP has launched the GlobalNetwork on Energy for Sustainable Development. The Network brings togetherleading institutions in developing and developed countries to work together onenergy, environment and sustainable development issues. 36. The World Bank has its own lending a nd technical assistance programme in energy, which is focused on access, private sector development and environmentalprotection. It is the largest source of energy investment financing in the multilateralsystem. Energy activities carried out at the national level include support for energysector reform, energy supply expansion through infrastructure development, support for expanded private sector investment in energy projects and improvingmacroeconomic and fiscal balances related to the energy sector. Efforts to include energy considerations in poverty reduction strategy papers processes are expanding. The World Bank and UNDP are partners in the Global Village Energy Partnershipwhich brings together developing and industrialized country Governments, publicand private organizations, multilateral institutions, consumers and others in an effortto ensure access to modern energy services by the poor. The Department ofEconomic and Social Affairs, UNDP, UNEP, World Bank and UNIDO all supportactivities related to the Clean Developm ent Mechanism, one of the financing mechanisms supported under the Kyoto Protocol. 37. UNIDO has worked extensively on energy efficiency, in particular in large and medium-scale enterprises, and on energy supply issues in the industrial sector.UNIDO provides technical assistance and pre-investment support on energy projectsin numerous countries. 38. FAO continues to address, at the policy level, the linkages between energy in general, and renewable energy in particul ar, with rural economic activity in order to promote growth and poverty alleviation. It is launching a new strategy on bioenergywith a wood energy component and an agroenergy component designed toconsolidate efforts related to the critical situation of traditional biomass in many rural areas of developing countries, and to promote the entry of modern biomassenergy conversion, such as agricultural and forestry sub-products and, morespecifically, energy crops. In close coope ration with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, FAO continues to assess the close linkage s between bioenergy and climate change57CEB/2003/7 and to develop baseline criteria and methodologies to promote Clean Development Mechanism-eligible projects on reduction of greenhouse gas emissions throughagricultural practices. FAO continues to pr omote the application of biomass, solar and wind energy systems in rural areas, with the design and promotion of productiveuses of renewable energy an important area of focus. 39. UNCTAD has developed expertise on th e interface between the multilateral trade rules, trade in energy goods and services and domestic policies and strategies,especially in energy-rich developing countries. Its work in this field has led to anumber of publications and intergovernme ntal expert meetings on the issue of energy and environmental services, intern ational trade and development priorities as well as technical cooperation activitie s and joint initiatives with other intergovernmental organizations, including the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Amemorandum of understanding with the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries led to two studies in 2003 on implications of the interface betweenenvironment and trade policies for oil-exporting countries. Through its CarbonMarket Programme, UNCTAD has also fo cused on exploring the economic, trade and investment impacts of climate change in developing and transitional countriesand works to promote their effective participation in the emerging carbon market. 40. Through the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) assists stakeholders in ensuring that theyachieve efficient and sustainable energy use. Weather and climate information are vital to the development and efficient use of renewable energy resources which, inturn, are critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and protecting our futureclimate. In this regard, WMO supports activities related to sustainable energy andefficient use through: coordination of obser vations of weather, climate and water; provision of assistance to countries in establishment and maintenance of reliablemeteorological data bases; support of pilo t projects and capacity-building activities on application of climate information in energy-related issues; co-sponsorship ofenergy-related international activities a nd programmes, such as those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Cha nge and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; and provision of technical advice on policy mattersrelated to sustainable energy. 41. The United Nations regional commissions regularly undertake a significant number of energy-related analytical and technical cooperation activities aimed atstrengthening national capacities of its members and associate members. TheCommissions also support and contribute to the global process, including theCommission on Sustainable Development, and undertake regional implementationof the outcomes of international confer ences, including the Millennium Summit and the World Summit on Sustainable Development, in partnership with the Departmentof Economic and Social Affairs, UNEP, UNDP and other United Nations andregional governmental and non-governmental agencies. Recent activities of theregional commissions in the field of energy are already in the process ofreorientation towards the implementation of the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation, focusing on all the key issu es identified in it and as referred to earlier in the present report.58CEB/2003/7 Gaps in the United Nations system capacity on energy 42. A preliminary review of existing capacity in the United Nations system undertaken by the HLCP working group led to the identification of gaps within theUnited Nations system both in terms of th e programmatic reach of institutions, and the financial resources available to them to implement their mandates. 43. Some of these specific gaps include: Lack of integration of energy-related aspects in the overall socio-economic development programmes and projects Lack of quality information, statistics and indicators: information used in decision-making varies in quality and criteria for its collection differ.Measurement of progress towards target s/goals requires accurate, accessible and relevant information Lack of guidance on deregulation and ener gy sector reform: the general trend towards market reform holds true also for the energy sector. Developingcountries face particular challenges and the United Nations system should beactive in responding to them Need for better integration of normativ e, analytical and operational activities of the United Nations in the field of energy Need for better balance between ups tream activities dealing with policy advisory services and downstream activ ities dealing with operational activities at the country level Lack of effective means for translating global goals into country-level and sectoral action plans Lack of mutually reinforcing collabor ation and enhanced policy coherence between various intergovernmental processe s relevant to energy for sustainable development and climate change Lack of effective collaborative and cooperative mechanisms in the area of energy within the United Nations system and between the United Nationssystem and non-United Nations actors. 44. No single entity in the United Nations system has primary responsibility for energy and, as such, independent approaches have been taken by each entity withinits mandate, with the result that a system-wide approach to addressing energy issueshas not yet emerged. Progress in a ddressing the issue of cooperation and coordination has been rather slow. An adequate response to the call for joint actionson energy by the United Nations and by all stakeholders in the Johannesburg Plan ofImplementation would require far more inclusive and broad-based arrangements. This isan area where other development actors, particularly in the private sector, have clearcomparative advantages and must be effectively engaged in the follow-up efforts. 45. The Ad Hoc Inter-Agency Task Force on Energy, which supported the work of the ninth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, elaborated on asystem-wide approach to energy and sustainable development. It was agreed in theTask Force that such an approach should provide a reference framework for theenergy-related activities of the United Nations system and the strategy shouldpromote a balanced and mutually reinforcing approach to the economic, social and59CEB/2003/7 environmental aspects of sustainable energy development.j The Task Force reached an agreement on general principles for a comm on approach to energy and sustainable development and undertook joint activities re lated to the implementation of the World Solar Programme, development of Sustainable Energy Indicators and inputsto the Commission, as well as facilitating cooperation among agencies on a numberof World Summit partnerships. The Task Force established working modalities toexchange and disseminate information to enhance coordination on energy activities up to the Johannesburg Summit. However, no inter-agency consensus emerged onthe modalities or mechanism for system-wide coordination in the area of energy. 46. Developing a coherent and coordinated response to the follow-up to the World Summit in the area of energy represents a major and critical challenge to the UnitedNations system's efforts in support of sustainable development. Due to thecomplexity of the issues, their interrela tionships within the broader sustainable development framework and the diversity of mandates and approaches that exist, asignificant further effort will be required to develop a coherent, collaborative andeffective United Nations system response. Decision No. 4 The Committee requested its Vice-Chairman to convene a subgroup of the most concerned member organizations to undertake a comprehensive review of current activities in the light of the World Summit on Sustainable Developmentmandates, prepare proposals, drawing upon th e experience to date, on system-wide collaborative arrangements on energy that also include provisions for participationof non-United Nations actors, and submit an interim report to HLCP by the end of2003. Progress achieved would be reflected in the report for the next (twelfth)session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, to be held in April 2004. Itrequested the subgroup to submit its final report to HLCP at its spring 2004 session. C. Oceans and coastal areas 47. The World Summit on Sustainable Development emphasized that oceans, seaislands and coastal areas form an integrat ed and essential component of the Earth's ecosystem and are critical for global food security and for sustaining economicprosperity. Recognizing the critical importance of this issue, the Summit adopted anumber of concrete goals in the areas of ecosystem approach, fish stocks,biodiversity, protection of the marine e nvironment, particularly from land-based activities, maritime safety and improving the scientific understanding andassessment of marine and coastal ecosystems. Some of the specific goals or targetscontained in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation are as follows: (a) Encourage the application by 2010 of the ecosystem approach for the sustainable development of oceans; (b) Maintain or restore fish stocks to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield with the aim of achieving these goals for depleted stocks on anurgent basis and, where possible, not later than 2015; (c) Put into effect the FAO international plans of action by the agreed dates for the management of fishing capacity by 2005 and to prevent, deter and eliminateillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by 2004;60CEB/2003/7 (d) Develop and facilitate the use of di verse approaches and tools, including the ecosystem approach, the elimination of destructive fishing practices, theestablishment of marine protected areas c onsistent with international law and based on scientific information, including representative networks by 2012; (e) Establish by 2004 a regular process under the United Nations for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment; (f) Eliminate subsidies that contribute to illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and to overcapacity. 48. In adopting these specific goals, the Summit recognized that ensuring sustainable development of the oceans, covering such wide range of issues, wouldrequire effective coordination and coopera tion, including at the global and regional levels, as well as among the relevant bodies. In this context, the Johannesburg Planof Implementation called for steps to establish an effective, transparent and regularinter-agency coordination mechanism on ocea n and coastal issues within the United Nations system. The Summit's recommendation was subsequently endorsed by theGeneral Assembly in its resolution 57/141 of 12 December 2002. 49. Until the restructuring of the CEB machinery, the former ACC Subcommittee on Oceans and Coastal Areas was the principal inter-agency mechanism addressingsince 1993, issues of environmental protection and sustainable development, amandate derived from chapter 17 of Agenda 21 adopted by the United NationsConference on Environment and Development. The issue of internationalcoordination and cooperation in this area was repeatedly raised during variousintergovernmental meetings, particularly the fourth and seventh sessions of the Commission on Sustainable Development. It was emphasized that the issues ofocean space need to be pursued in an inte grated manner with the involvement of all relevant actors. At the seventh session of the Commission on SustainableDevelopment, held in 1999, it was emphasized that, building on existingarrangements, a more integrated approach was required to all legal, economic, socialand environmental aspects of the oceans and seas both at intergovernmental andinter-agency levels. As far as the inte rgovernmental level was concerned, the Commission recommended to the General A ssembly the establishment of an open- ended informal consultative process. 50. Acting on the recommendation of the Commission, the General Assembly, by its resolution 54/33 of 24 November 1999 decided to establish an Open-endedInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea. This process wasmandated to cover both the issues related to the legal framework provided by the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the goals of chapter 17 ofAgenda 21, and to facilitate the annual review by the General Assembly bysuggesting particular areas where coordination and cooperation at the intergovernmental and inter-agency levels should be enhanced. 51. The Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea has held four meetings thus far. The issue of inter-agency coordinationmechanism has been discussed during t hose meetings and has been strongly emphasized, particularly during the thir d (2002) and fourth (2003) sessions. The Consultative Process has identified a number of functions that need to be pursuedthrough such a mechanism, including: (a) coordinating and harmonizing theagencies' activities related to oceans; (b ) reviewing programmes and activities and61CEB/2003/7 identifying issues needing to be addressed, with a view to updating and enriching the relationship between the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea andAgenda 21; (c) ensuring integrated ocean management at the international level; (d)coordinating inputs to the annual report of the Secretary-General on oceans and law of the sea. In addition, both in the Consultative Process and at the inter-agencylevel, the need is increasingly felt for de dicated but flexible processes to undertake joint activities to address emerging challe nges and such issues as Global Marine Assessment, regional ocean governance and developing guidelines for theapplication of ecosystem approach. 52. There is a widely shared view, also reflected in the report of the HLCP Open- Ended Group on World Summit on Sustainable Development Follow-Up, thatenhanced coordination of activities rela ting to oceans and coastal areas would require both review and harmonization of ongoing activities, as well as addressingthe emerging challenges and launching of new joint initiatives. To cover all aspects,including political, legal, security, economic, social, and environmental, thismechanism should include not only members of the former Subcommittee onOceans and Coastal Areas, but also international financial institutions and otherinstitutions such as the International Seabed Authority and secretariats ofmultilateral environment treaties, for example, the Convention on Biodiversity, theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, etc. 53. Future inter-agency mechanisms should thus be capable of performing at least the two core functions mentioned above, namely reviewing ongoing work in thisarea and developing coordinated/joint re sponses to emerging challenges, and/or launching new joint initiatives. It should work in a flexible manner in accordancewith the CEB mandates. 54. The first set of activities mentioned in paragraph 48 above could be pursued through an open-ended network covering a wide range of issues and composed ofthe relevant programmes, entities and spec ialized agencies of the United Nations system and the secretariats of the releva nt international conventions, including the International Seabed Authority. Such a network could operate as a flexiblemechanism to review joint and overla pping ongoing activities and to support related deliberations of the Consultative Pro cess. A steering group of the network, composed of senior representatives of th e most directly involved organizations and programmes should meet as required to coordinate programmes, harmonize reporting and review ongoing activities. The timing of such meetings could becoordinated with the sessions of the Consultative Process. 55. At the same time, the network could pursue time-bound initiatives, with well- defined terms of reference, through task-o riented groups, open to the participation of non-governmental organizations and other international stakeholders. Emerging challenges or new initiatives could be id entified by the network, based on relevant work inside and outside the United Nations system. An example of such task-oriented groups could be the establishment of a task force comprising leadingagencies dedicated to the coordination, planning and implementation of the GlobalMarine Assessment or on regional ocean governance. 56. The modalities of this approach to coordination could include the intensive use of electronic communication; holding meeti ngs normally in conjunction with other related meetings; the establishment of written agreements among heads of agenciesor responsible managers; and open dialogue with non-United Nations system actors62CEB/2003/7 and transparent communication with all partners, including through the use of a dedicated web site. 57. The proposed new coordinating mechanism should build on the experience and make full use of existing inter-agency cooperative mechanisms or projects,including the Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the MarineEnvironment, the Global International Wa ter Assessment, the United Nations Atlas of the Oceans, the Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of MarineEnvironmental Protection, the Global Oceans Observing System, and others. Decision No. 5 The Committee approved the above-mentione d approach and the creation of an Oceans and Coastal Areas Network, building upon the Subcommittee on Oceans andCoastal Areas and in line with the CEB call for a more dynamic arrangement, whichleaves it possible for non-United Nations act ors to contribute to the achievement of Johannesburg Plan of Implementation targets, in accordance with agreed criteria thatare transparent and balanced. It requested the Network to urgently set up a taskgroup to draw up the Network's terms of reference and work programme, which should be submitted to HLCP before the end of the current year. Decision No. 6 The Committee requested the Division for Ocean Affairs and Law of the Sea to keep it informed of progress achieved in the establishment by 2004 of a regularprocess for global reporting and assessment of the state of the marine environment, ascalled for by the Plan of Implementation and General Assembly resolution 57/141. D. Changing unsustainable patterns of consumption and production 58. The Plan of Implementation highlights the essential actions required to achieve fundamental changes in the way societies produce and consume, changes that willbe indispensable for achieving global sustainable development. It also calls (in para.15) for a 10-year framework of programmes in support of regional and nationalinitiatives to accelerate the shift towards sustainable consumption and production topromote social and economic development within the carrying capacity ofecosystems by addressing and, where appropriate, delinking economic growth andenvironmental degradation. The Framework will focus on achieving efficiency andsustainability in the use of resources a nd production processes to help to reduce resource degradation, pollution and waste. It also envisions collaboration between nations, with developed countries in the lead, to mobilize from all sources, financialand technical assistance, as well as capacity-building for developing countries. Asfollow-up to the Plan, a meeting of intern ational experts was held in Marrakech, Morocco, from 16 to 19 June 2003, to develop a 10-Year Framework of Programmesfor Sustainable Consumption and Production on the basis of the outcomes of twopreparatory meetings of experts held in Argentina and Indonesia. 59. The Marrakech Process is a basic step towards the development of a 10-year framework of programmes for sustai nable consumption and production and identified the following as guide for future work: integrating the three dimensions of sustainable development in formulating policies for promoting sustainableconsumption and production; ensuring the integration of sustainable consumption63CEB/2003/7 and production in national sustainable develo pment strategies and where applicable, in poverty-reduction strategies; the need for political commitment at all levels andsectors; setting out of specific priorities with targeted and effective international cooperation; institutional and social capacity-building; development and diffusion ofsustainable technologies and financial means for implementing policies andprogrammes; dissemination of informati on including awareness raising, education, training, media and advertising; and finally ensuring the active involvement of allstakeholders. 60. The Marrakech Process has reaffirmed the existing inter-agency collaborative arrangements and has produced a 10- Year Framework of Programmes for Sustainable Consumption and Production with a clear set of objectives and workmodalities. This envisages expert meetings every two years to monitor, evaluate and guide the work of the United Nations system and other partners as follow-up to theJohannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on SustainableDevelopment. The biennial meeting will be supported by informal task forces orfocused round table. 61. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNEP are the principal organizations within the United Nations system concerned with sustainableconsumption and production in general, while a number of other organizations have been involved with specific issues, such as UNIDO on cleaner production, theUnited Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pa cific on sustainable human settlements, UNCTAD on trade and sustainability, the Basel Convention secretariat on wastemanagement, UNESCO on education for sustainable development, and theInternational Labour Organization on working conditions, to give a few examples. 62. Both the Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNEP are, however, involved with broad policy questions a nd have responsibilities with regard to specific issues. The activities of the Depa rtment of Economic and Social Affairs include environmental management accounting, national industrial strategies forsustainable production, national policies for sustainable public procurement, indicators of sustainable consumption and production and assessments of global trends in that regard. UNEP has progra mmes addressing consumer awareness and advertising, ecolabels, the life-cycle approach, cleaner production, procurement training, procurement by international orga nizations, partnerships with business and financial institutions, ecodesign and product service system. 63. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs and UNEP could take the lead in convening the biennial broad internati onal meetings and a regional consultative process, in collaboration with the regional commissions. In accordance withrequirements, they may organize task for ces, round tables and other expert meetings on specific issues in consultation with other concerned organizations. 64. The Marrakech Process recognized the importance of intergovernmental and institutional communication and of inter-a gency collaboration. It will also provide input to intergovernmental decision-making. It would appear that collaboration and coordination for follow-up to the World Summit on Sustainable Development andthe implementation of its Plan of Impl ementation through the 10-year Framework does not require the setting up of a formal collaborative mechanism and that theprincipal organizations involved are taking the lead in carrying out tasks associatedwith different aspects of the Framework.64CEB/2003/7 Decision No. 7 The Committee endorsed the approach adopted by the Marrakech Process and requested the lead organizations, the Department of Economic and Social Affairsand UNEP, in cooperation with other orga nizations concerned, in particular UNIDO and UN-Habitat, to implement the Framework and keep HLCP informed on furtherdevelopments in this area. The Department of Economic and Social Affairs andUNEP should consult on all aspects of work and also develop a joint web site, sothat all concerned are kept fully informed, on a timely basis, of ongoing activitiesand other developments in the context of the Framework.
