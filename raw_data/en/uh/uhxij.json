Females go through many major hormonal shifts in their life, including puberty, pregnancy, and menopause. Spinal adjustments can help regulate hormone production in the body, thus easing the transition from the different chapters of a female's life. With women experiencing hormonal changes on almost a daily basis, and many problems can occur if there are health issues or stress on the body. Women may experience painful PMS symptoms or even irregular or missing monthly cycles. Hormonal Health Issues Premenstrual syndrome, or PMS, is the name given to the time prior to a woman's menstrual cycle. This occurs because of major hormonal shifts during the monthly cycle. Symptoms may include: - Headaches - Severe stomach cramps & Bloating - Irritability - Skin breakouts - Digestive issues - Back pain - Mood swings - Food cravings (Chocolate anyone?!) It is reported that up to 50% of women of childbearing age experience PMS to some degree. Unfortunately, PMS is thought to be a \"normal\" part of a woman's cycle and something that they must just \"deal with\". Women are also taught to take OTC medication like Midol or Tylenol to relieve the symptoms. Some women have such intense symptoms, their doctor prescribes them birth control medication to help with PMS. However, most women don't know the side effects of taking these medications. Some include: - dizziness, drowsiness - mild headache - dry mouth, nose, or throat - constipation or upset stomach - blurred vision - feeling nervous - sleep problems (insomnia) - Decreased Liver Function (with prolonged use) Birth Control Side Effects: Weight gain, headaches, dizziness, bloating, blood clotting and increased risk of stroke Most women don't realize that PMS is actually not normal. They are symptoms that the body is under stress and hormones are not at balanced levels. They are not to be ignored...you don't have to struggle each month! Natural PMS Remedies Research has uncovered a great deal of evidence connecting spinal misalignments (subluxations) with hormonal imbalances. C1, the first bone in the spinal column, controls the blood flow and nerve supply to the brain and pituitary gland, which is responsible for hormone production and balance. Nerves to the mid and low back control the function of the reproductive organs. Studies have shown that chiropractic can greatly reduce PMS and other hormonal imbalances. When subluxations are removed, it will often improve the way the body produces and controls the output of hormones. Women under chiropractic care have reported decreased PMS symptoms, less back pain and overall improvement with their hormones.
