Holistic practitioners believe that the whole person is made up of interdependent parts and if one part is not working properly, all the other parts will be affected. A holistic practitioner may recommend and use many health and wellness modalities. These include referring to western medical doctors and specialists, using whole food vitamins and nutrients, herbs, [homeopathics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy) and lifestyle therapy modifications to support a patient. For example, when a person suffering from chronic [irritable bowel syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irritable_bowel_syndrome) pays a visit to a holistic doctor, instead of walking out with just medications, the doctor will likely take a look at all the potential factors that may be causing the IBS, including other health problems such as nutrition and sleep habits, stress and personal problems, and preferred spiritual practices. The treatment plan may involve what they are currently doing with their primary care physician and/or lifestyle modifications to help prevent the IBS symptoms and episodes from recurring. so what is holistic living Holistic living focuses on a lifestyle that fosters us physically, mentally, and spiritually. It encourages a mentality that focuses on the body as a whole, and that each body part and system is intricately connected. This is a concept that is sensible and is easy to understand, BUT the fast pace of our lives can often cause us to disconnect and lose sight of the importance of the mind, body and spirit connection. We often put our health and wellness aside until problems occur. In order to maximize our potential each day and live to the fullest, we need to prioritize ourselves as human beings, especially when it comes to our health. The phrase \"health is wealth\" is absolutely true. The phrase \"holistic living\" triggers a variety of different thoughts for many people. Ultimately, I think many people think living holistically is overwhelming, and means doing everything organic, not using any products or household items that contain anything that isn't \"natural\", eating bland green foods, not indulging in any sweets and sugar, not using a microwave, and essentially not taking pharmaceuticals or agreeing with Modern Medicine. While some of these principles are true, many of them are not. To clarify, eating organic healthy food is a great choice to nourish your body, BUT if it is done and leads to a feeling of deprivation or guilt then the important aspects of holistic living are unbalanced. See what I mean? So what am I saying? While I do encourage healthy organic eating and living, I also encourage you to have some of the foods you enjoy once in a while, like having an ice cream with your loved ones, having a pumpkin beer and wings during a Patriots game, or enjoying Chinese food on New Years Eve, without guilt or negative feelings. Holistic health seeks to look at the \"Whole\" person, and takes the many facets of human beings into account. This includes harmony of your MBS (mind, body and spirit) in order to achieve optimal health and wellness. So essentially, achieving a balance is the goal when it comes to living a healthy lifestyle. Just keeping it real I eat organic foods as much as I can, utilize herbs and alternative medicine, lift weights regularly, do yoga, practice mediation and mindfulness, limit sugar, use natural products, and take pharmaceuticals only when necessary. But I'm going to let you in on something...I frequently stop at Boston Donut's in Downtown Shrewsbury or InHouse Coffee in Worcester for iced coffee while I'm out running errands (with no sugar or no artificial sweeteners though). I will have a cheat meal that consists of pizza or Chinese food. I'll indulge in a double IPA from Treehouse Brewing Co. on a Friday night with my husband as he unwinds from a long work week. My kids will sometimes outright refuse the organic meal that I made for dinner, and I will succumb to giving them hotdogs, chicken nuggets, or macaroni and cheese. And yes, I catch myself eating off of their plates occasionally. Not to mention, I love make-up, dye my hair (with organic and natural products whenever possible) and do enjoy a makeover! You can absolutely live holistically while looking and feeling good, especially now with some of the amazing companies and products available. I routinely visit my Primary Care Physician and OB-GYN. I should mention that I am a mother of three beautiful girls, and due to medical necessity they were delivered via C-Section. I strongly advocate for natural birth, but also understand from personal experience that this is not always possible-and that's okay. I strongly believe in a harmonious synergy of traditional Western principles and Holistic modalities for truly optimized health. So yes, there are some natural health practitioners that may disagree with my view, but I really believe finding a balance with healthy living precisely encompasses what it means to live Holistic. Food tastes better when you eat it with family and friends One of the greatest ways to achieve emotional and spiritual health is through strong and positive relationships with others. The summer and holidays are times when we often come together with our friends and family to celebrate and enjoy a big meal together. Many of those closest to us may not be anywhere near the holistic living state of mind, and that is completely okay. Social gatherings and holidays are most likely not going to have organic and natural whole-food dishes, and again this is okay. Whenever I am invited to a social gathering at someone's home, I will bring a healthy organic dish to share with others, but at the same time will moderately indulge in a glass of wine, eat a hearty meal, and enjoy a slice of pie with my loved ones. There should not be guilt associated with it, but rather a sense of gratitude and connection. Living holistically most of the time should not interfere with your social life, relationships and/or connections with others. The 80/20 rule is a principle that many people adopt for their lifestyle. It is no different than living and eating holistically. If you are adopting holistic principles 80% of the time, then the 20% allows you to \"be realistic,\" enjoy everything that life has to offer, and not deprive yourself of these pleasant experiences. What I am saying is, don't let living a holistic lifestyle get in the way of living your life. Rather, it should be the foundation to allow you to live a longer, healthier, and happier life. This is always my way of thinking, and this is where the principle \"Live Holistic But Realistic\" comes in. what it means to live holistic but realistic! In summary, it means living a healthy life WITHOUT depriving yourself. I am not just referring to food in reference to the deprivation. This includes deprivation of meaningful relationships, enjoyment of \"guilty pleasures,\" personal ME TIME, etc. What I am trying to say is, yes live healthy and make mindful good choices, but please let loose once in awhile and enjoy your life along the way!
