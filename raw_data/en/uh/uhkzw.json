San Mateo County received an annual average , in the last five yea rs through Fiscal Year 2018 -19, of about $29.7 million. MHSA emphasizes transformation of the behavioral health system, improving the quality of life for individuals living with behavioral health issues and increasing access for marginalized communities . MHSA planning, implementation, and evaluation incorporate s the following core values and standards : Community collaboration Cultural competence Consumer and family driven services Focus on wellness, recovery, resiliency Integrated service expe rience MHSA provides funding for Community Program Planning (CPP) activities, which includes stakeholder involvement in planning, implementation and evaluation. MHSA funded programs and activities are grouped into \"Components\" each one with its own set o f guidelines and rules: 19% $5.6M PEI targets individuals of all ages prior to the onset of mental illness, wit h the exception of early onset of psychotic disorders. INN funds projects to introduce new approaches or community -drive best practices that have not been proven to be effective.

San Mateo County do es not separate MHSA planning from its other continuous planning processes. Given this, stakeholder input from system -wide planning activities is taken into account in MHSA planning. In 2005, BHRS devised a local plann ing process and structure to seek inp ut from the broad San Mateo County stakeholder community. The Mental Health and Substance Abuse Recovery Commission (MHSARC), formerly our Mental Health Board, is involved in all MHSA planning activities providing inpu t, receiving regular updates as a sta nding agenda item on the ir monthly meetings, and making final recommendations to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors (BoS) on all MHSA plans and updates. The MHSARC meetings are open to the public, and attendanc e is encouraged through various means : notice of meetings (flyers, emails) are sent to a broad and increasing network of contacts including community partners and County agencies, as well as consumer and advocacy organizations, and the general public. MHSA RC commissioners are all members of t he MHSA Steering Committee. All Commissioners of the MHSARC are members of the MHSA Steering Committee. MHSA STEERING COMMIT TEE The MHSA Steering Committee was also created in 2005 and continues to play a critical r ole in MHSA . In 2016, the MHSA Steering Committee was restructured to strengthen the representation of diverse stakeholders. MHSA Steering Committee guidelines were de veloped along with an application process. The MHSA Steering Committee Roles and Respo nsibilities, Committee Membership and the Application are available on the MHSA website, www.smchealth.org/MHSA . The MHSA S teering Committee makes recommendations to the planning and services development proces s and assures that MHSA planning reflects local diverse needs and priorities, contains the appropriate balance of services within available resources and meets the crite ria and goals established. The meetings are open to the public and include opportunitie s for public comment. It is co-chaired by a member of the Board of Supervisors and by the Chair of the MHSARC and is comprised of over 30 community leaders representing the diverse San Mateo behavioral health constituents (clients, advocates, family membe rs, community partners, County and CBO staff), and non -behavioral health constituencies (County leadership, Education, Healthcare and Criminal Justice among others).

The survey asked respondents to rate the needs based on how important it is to address them over the next 3 years. There were 32 9 respondents, see Appendix 2 for the Needs Assessment summary of survey results . Preliminary survey results were presented to the MHSA Steering Committee on March 3, 2020 to gauge initial reaction s and launch the Strategy Development phase of the CPP proc ess.

Needs Assessment San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 16 of 66 The Strategy Development phase of the CPP process included the following two steps: 1. Input: 28 community input sessions and key interviews with diverse groups and vu lnerable populations were conducted to identify strategies to address the prioritized needs. Participants brainstorm strategies in the areas of prevention, direct service and workforce tr aining. See Appendix 4 for the Input Session materials and input rece ived. Participants were asked the following questions : Are there any program/service that are working well to address the need identified and would benefit from either expansion or enhancements? Is there a new service or program that you would like to see considered to address the need identified? 2. Prioritiz ation: To support the prioritization of strategies, participants were also asked: Which strategy will have the most impact over the next three years? Additionally, i n an effort to offset the anticipated lack of new funding, due to COVID -19 pandemic and upcoming recession, a strategic approach to addressing the input received, was proposed to the MHSA Steering Committee. The 22 strategies prioritized through the input sessions were organized under 5 MHSA Strategic Initiatives with the intent to reallocate e xisting MHSA staff resources to engage stakeholders in planning to develop an adaptive strategy direction for these initiatives . The goal being to a) defin e a continuum of services , b) identify gaps at a ll levels of support or intensity in treatment, and c) articulat e expected outcomes and identify the activities/strategies that will support a comprehensive continuum of services . This can be accomplished within the current budget and will give us valuable information we need to make informed decisions about funding and next steps once revenue increases. The 5 MHSA Strategic Initiatives and respective 22 strategies were presented to the MHSA Steering Committee on April 29, 20 20. Pre -recorded public comment s were included for each strategy area and an opportunity for additional public comments was provided. See Appendix 5 for the April 29th MHSA Steering Committee materials , notes and a full summary of the prioritization resul ts. The MHSA Steering Committee members were asked the following two questions via an online survey to help both a) rank the 5 Strategic Initiatives and b) rate the 22 strategies.

San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual U pdate FY 20/21 Page 18 of 66 The MHSA Three -Year Plan development includes the MHSA Steering Committee prioritized strategies as recommendations for funding when increase s in revenues are available . The Three -Year Plan builds on previous planning process es and existing funded programs. Existing programs are monitored, evaluated and adjust ed as needed during the implementation years and recommendations are made annually about continuing and/or ending a program. Any adjustments are presented to the MHSA Steering Committee and included in subsequent Annual Upd ates, which incorporates a 30-day public comment period. All agencies funded to provide MHSA services go through a formal Request for Proposal (RFP) process to ensure an open and competitive process . The RFP's are posted on the BHRS RFP website, www.smchealth.org/rfps , which includes a subscription option to receive notifications . The Three -Year Plan will be presented to the MHSARC for opening of a 30 -day public comment, a public hearing and subsequently s ubm itted to the Board of Supervisors for adoption. STAKEHOLDER S INVOLVED Extensive outreach was conducted to promote the two MHSA Steering Committee meetings and the Input Sessions. Flyers were made available in English, Spanish, Chinese, Tagalog, Tongan an d Russian. Stipends to consumers/clients and their family members and language interpretation were provided at each of these sessions. Child care for families and refreshments were offered for the first in -person meeting , prior to switching to online due t o COVID -19 pandemic. Pre-sessions for both the MHSA Steering Committee meetings were held as an orientation for clients, family members and community members. A t this session information was presented and shared to help prepare participants for the meet ings and to provide input and public comment. Discussion items included, 1) Background on MHSA; 2) What to expect at the meetings; and 2) How to prepare a public comment. Input included perspectives from clients and family members, communities across geog raphical, ethnic, cultural and social economic status , providers of behavioral health care services , social services and other sectors. The sessions were conducte d through 14 existing collaboratives/initiatives, 8 committees/workgroups, 3 geographically -focused (Coastside, East Palo Alto and North County) and 3 stakeholder groups of transition -age youth, immigrant families and veterans. Because of the historical b arriers to accessing and attending centrally located public meetings (mistrust, lack of trans portation, cultural and language accessibility) MHSA Three Year Plan San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 19 of 66 three Community Prioritization Sessions were scheduled in North County, East Palo Alto and the Coastside. Yet, the majority of the meetings ended up being conducted via phone and video conferencing given the COVID -19 shelter -in-place orders. Over 400 individuals participated across the various means of providing input (surveys, input sessions, public comments). While w e were unable to collect demographic data from all the Input Sessions, we know that 57 client and family member stipends were provided during various sessions as listed below , for a total amount of $1,425 . 2020 MHSA Input Sessions Stipend Record Summary Input Session Date # of Stipends Distributed Lived Experience Education Workgroup 3/3/2020 11 MHSA Strategy Launch 3/4/2020 15 African American Community Initiative 3/10/2020 3 Spirituality Initiative 3/10/2020 4 Latino Collaborative 3/24/2020 1 Chinese Health Initiative 4/3/2020 4 MHSA Strategy Prioritization 4/29/2020 19 Total 57 Demographics were collected for 329 survey respondents and 60 (of 88) participants via a Zoom Poll feature during the April 29th MHSA Steering Committee. Participants in each of these activities were not mutually exclusive and therefore demographics are su mmarized separately below. Attendance at input sessions and the meetings appeared to be slightly lower than the previous CPP process for the Three -Year Plan .

Up to 5% of total annual revenue may be spent on a dministration and community planning processes. In San Mateo County, MHSA funding is integrated throughout the BHRS system and highly leveraged. MHSAfunded activities further BHRS' vision, mission and strategic initiatives. San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 24 of 66 MHSA FUNDING PRINCIP LES MHSA Funding Principles build from the County's and Health division budge t balancing principles to guide MHSA reduction and allocation decisions when needed. MHSA funding is allocated based on the most current MHSA Three -Year Plan and subsequent Annual Update s. Any funding priorities being considered outside of the MHSA Three -Year Plan priorities require MHSA Steering Committee approval and stakeholder engagement, which will include a 30 -day public comment period and public hearing as required by the MHSA leg islation. The MHSA Funding Principles where presented to the MHSA St eering Committee in September 2018 for input and comment given a budget reduction planning throughout the County that was expected to have implications for MHSA funding. The Funding Principles will continue to lead budget decisions moving into COVID -19 pan demic anticipated recession. Maintain MHSA required funding allocations Sustain and strengthen existing MHSA programs - MHSA revenue should be prioritized to fully fund core services that fulfill the goals of MHSA and prevent any local or realignment dolla rs filling where MHSA should. Maximize revenue sources - billing and fiscal practices to draw down every possible dollar from other revenue sources (e.g. Medi -Cal) should be improved as relevant for MHSA funded programs. Utilize MHSA reserves over multi -year period - MHSA reserves should be used strategically to mitigate impact to services and planned expansions during b udget reductions. Prioritize direct services to clients - indirect services are activities not directly related to client care (e.g. progra m evaluation, general administration, staff training). Direct services will be prioritized as necessary to strengthe n services to clients and mitigate impact during budget reductions. Sustain geographic, cultural, ethnic, and/or linguistic equity - MHSA aims to reduce disparities and fill gaps in services; reductions in budget should not impact any community group disp roportionately. Prioritize prevention efforts - at minimum, 19% allocation to Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) should be maintained and additionally the impact across the spectrum of PEI services and services that address the root causes of behavior al health issues in communities should be prioritized. Evaluate potential reduction or allocation scenarios - All funding decisions should be assessed against BHRS's Mission, Vision and Values and when relevant against County and Health System Budget Balan cing Principles. San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 25 of 66 ANNU AL REVENUE GROWTH Statewide, MHSA represents a little under a third of community mental health funding. In San Mateo County, MHSA represents about 15% of the behavioral health revenue. The average annual revenue for the last five year s equals to about $29.7 million for San Mateo County. Annual MHSA revenue distributions are difficult to estimate and volatile. MHSA fund ing is based on various projections that take into account information produced by the State Department of Finance, a nalyses provided by the California Behavioral Health Director's Association (CBHDA), and ongoing internal analyses of the State's fiscal si tuation. The following chart shows annual revenue allocation for San Mateo County since inception. Below are factors that impacted the decreases and increases in revenues throughout the years: FY 05/06 and FY 06/07: funding included Community Supports (CSS) only. FY 07/08 and FY 08/09: Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) and Innovations (INN) dollars w ere released in those years, respectively. FY 10/11 and FY 11/12: the California recession of 2009 led to decreased revenues FY 12/13: C ounties began receiving monthly MHSA allocations based on actual accrual of tax revenue (AB100), resulting in a \"one time\" allocation. FY 14/15: changes in the tax law that took effect on January 1, 2013, led to many taxpayers filing in December 2012 res ulting in a \"one time\" increase. FY 19/20: \"No Place Like Home\" estimated cost for San Mateo County is $1.3 million, taken from revenue growth or \"off the top .\" Additionally, there was an extension of filing of taxes to July 2020, due to COVID -19 pandemic . FY 20/21: projections include an \"artificial\" increase to filing of 19/20 taxes . FY 21/22 and 22/23: projected decreased Fiscal YearRevenue Growth *projected revenue San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 26 of 66 FUNDING CONSIDERATIO NS Impact of COVID -19 pandemic Given the significant reven ue decrease projections expected to continue through Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 -23, it is unlikely that we will be able to fund any new programs or expansions during the implementation of this Three -Year Plan. Yet, priorities for funding were still developed with stakeholders which will, along with the MHSA Funding Principles, guide all funding decisions moving forward . The COVID -19 pandemic has brought on a lot of challenges related to providing quality , timely and relevant services to clients as they shelte r-in-place. Clients need technology devices to stay connected, recei ve telehealth services and communicate with their service providers. Providers in residential and other services are in need of flexible funds to purchase activities for clients (cards, games, arts and crafts, etc.) to keep them engaged. Other behavioral health funding streams (general County funds, realignment and local sales tax) for core behavioral health services are now in jeopardy . Additionally, there are three Innovation projects in San Mateo County that will need s ustainability funding past FY 21/22. As of July 1, 2018, there is about $5 million in unspent one-time funding available from end of FY 18/19 to support COVID -related impacts in San Mateo County . Funding priorities for these monies where developed with feedback from stakeholders and in cluded the following categories : Technology Supports and Other Client Support Needs Workforce Education and Training Stop Gaps for budget reduction impacts The following community stakeh older groups were engaged in providing input: Contractor's Association - May 21, 2020 Lived Experience Workgroup - June 1, 2020 MHSARC Older Adult Committee - June 3, 2020 MHSARC Adult Committee - June 17, 2020 MHSARC Youth Committee - June 17, 2020 [On June 3, 2020 , the MHSARC reviewed a prelimin ary plan for using unspent monies for COVID -related impacts, they subsequently voted to open the 30 -day public comment period and on July 1, 2020 reviewed the public comments received, voted to close the 30 -day public comment period and subsequently voted to submit the plan to the Board of Supervisors for approval . The plan including all public comments received is included in Appendix 1.] *this section to be updated/confirmed once the public comment period clo ses San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 27 of 66 Target Reserve Counties are required to establish a Prudent Reserve to ensure the County programs will be able to serve clients should MHSA revenues drop. The California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) Info Notice 19 -017, released on Marc h 20, 2019, establishe d an MHSA Prudent Reserve level that does not exceed 33% of the average Community Services and Supports (CSS) revenue received in the preceding five years. For San Mateo County, this corresponds to $6.7 million. The Prudent Reserve ca n only be accessed whe n \"revenues for the Mental Health Services Fund are below recent averages adjusted by changes in the state population and the California Consumer Price Index\" subject to DHCS approval. As per our MHSA Annual Update for FY 2019/20 , the San Mateo County MH SA Steering Committee , our local mental health board and Board of Supervisors, reviewed and approved a recommended Total Operational Reserve of 50% (Prudent Reserve + additional operating reserve), of the highest annual revenue for Sa n Mateo County , which currently equals $17 million. For San Mateo County, t he MHSA Prudent Reserve remains at $600,000 and the additional Operational Reserve is in a local MHSA Trust Fund. This allows the flexibility in budgeting for short -term fluctuatio ns in funding without having to go through the State's administrative process to access the Prudent Reserve, in the event that revenue decline is less than the State's threshold or funding is needed in a timely manner. Reversion MHSA legislation requires that MHSA funding und er the key components (CSS, PEI and INN) be spent within a 3 -year time or it must be returned to the State for reallocation to other mental health agencies. San Mateo County annual spending in CSS and PEI targets the 5 -year average revenue, which keeps from reversion risk. INN on the other hand requires project approval by the Mental Health Services Oversight Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) before funds can be expended. Assembly Bill (AB) 114 established that the 3-year reversio n time frame for INN funds will now commence upon approval of the project plans; this should minimize the reversion risk for funds accrued while planning for new projects and/or awaiting approval. AB 114 and a subsequent Senate Bill (SB) 192 allowed Counti es to submit a plan by January 1, 2019 for expending funds by June 30, 3030 that were deemed reverted as of July 1, 2017. San Mateo County submitted plans for INN in the amount of $3,832,545 and WET in the amount of $423,610. The INN plan was approved for an extension . The WET funding was expended as proposed. San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 28 of 66 Unencumbered Housing Funds On June 2, 2015, the release of unencumbered San Mateo County MHSA housing funds was approved by our Board of Supervisors following MHSA Steering Committee and MHSARC r eview and recommenda tion to approve. DHCS Info Notice 16 -025 required Counties to complete Ongoing Fund Release Authorization for both existing and future unencumbered funds that may be received by CalHFA on behalf of the counties (e.g. funds that are no l onger required by a housing project, accrued interest, and/or other funds receive on behalf of the counties. Funds will be released annually by May 1st. The Ongoing Fund Release Authorization was approved by our Board of Supervisors on April 7, 2020. Cur rently, San Mateo Co unty has an estimated $104,066 in accrued interest and loan payments, which we expected to receive FY 19/20. Counties must spend the housing funds to provide \"housing assistance\", which means rental assistance or capitalized operating subsidies; security deposits, utility deposits, or other move - in cost assistance; utility payments; moving cost assistance; and capital funding to build or rehabilitate housing for persons who are seriously mentally ill and homeless or at risk of homelessn ess. A community pl anning process will inform the use of the funds. PRIORITY EXPANSIONS MHSA priorities identified by stakeholders in the previous Three -Year Plan, that have not been implemented, remain top priorities moving forward. Progress on previous MHSA Three -Year Plan Priority Expansions Priority Expansions Cost Implemented per Fi scal Year Expansion of supports for older adults $130,000 YES - Partial Senior Peer Counseling Field -based mental health and wellness services to expand access to Coastside $450,000 YES Coastside Multi -Cultural Wellness Center Expansion of Stigma Free San Mateo, Suicide Prevention and Student Mental Health efforts $50,000 YES Suicide Prevention mini -grants and county -wide stigma survey Youth mental health cr isis support and prevention $600,000 In Progress San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 29 of 66 Trauma -Informed Services training for 0 -5 providers $150,000 YES First 5 of SMC MOU After -care services for early psychosis treatment for reengagement, maintenance and family navigator support $230,000 YES (re)MIND/BEAM Aftercare Services Expansion of culturally responsive outreach strategies $50,000 YES Chinese community outreach in North County + East Palo Alto and Coastside community collaboration facilitation Youth Mobile Crisis Response Planning In San Mateo County, we were able to implement all but one priority expansion from the previous Three -Year Plan , related to youth mental health crisis support and prevention . A Request for Proposal (RFP) for a Youth Mobile Crisis Response and Prevention program, was released in March 2019. Due to County -wide budget constraints, the RFP was put on hold in June 2019 and eventually withdrawn to ens ure an integrated approach to youth crisis response . This has given us an opportunity to augment the program p lanning and address some of the most prominent concerns related to improv ing coordination and efficiency versus implementing a free -standing cri sis response program. Questions we are considering in planning include how the mobile crisis team integrate s with other crisis response efforts, school crisis protocols , law enforcement and private insurance s, given that over sixty percent of youth in San Mateo County are privately insured. Starting in October 2019, the Youth Committee of our local mental health bo ard, the Mental Health and Substance Use Commission (MHSARC) has been meeting monthly to plan an integrated youth crisis strategy, see Appendix 7 for the DRAFT youth crisis strategy concept . Recently, d ue to COVID 19 pandemic, the project planning is on hold, and we expect to revisit and determine appropriate next steps in the fall 2020. San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 30 of 66 MHSA Three -Year Plan Priorities , Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 -23 Given the significant revenue decrease projections through FY 2022 -23, it is unlikely that we will be able to fund any new programs or expansions during the implementation of this Three -Year Plan. Moving into th is new Three -Year Plan, t he p reviously prioritized programs and expenditures will continue . As required, if there is a need to decrease, shift or update the Three -Year Plan in any way, a community planning process will be conducted including a 30 -day public comment process and Board of Supervisor approval. Previous fiscal priorities will continue: Ongoing MHSA program expenditure s (See Appendix 6 for the funding summary) $12.5M Plan to Spend One Time Funds (See page 55, Plan to Spend One Time Funds ) $17M target Operational Reserve ; 50% of the highest annual revenue New fiscal priorities included in this Three Year Plan: $5M unspent from FY 2018 19 alloc ated to onetime COVID 19 related budget impacts $2M a nticipated u se of operational reserve to cover decreases in revenue and ongoing expenditures in FY 22 23. $5M for n ew MHSA Innovation programs (pending OAC approval) over the next three years Fiscal pr iorities if revenues increase : Ongoing programs that will be funded temporarily with unspent monies through the $12.5M Plan to Spend One Time Funds that o Innovation program sustainability o Workforce Education and Training loan repayment match o Peer certific ation/training and advocacy Priority expansion from Three Year Plan program planning process o Mental health workers providing on the field, mobile mental health assessments and tr eatment for homeless individuals and linkages to housing. o Trained/certified pe ers providing peer and family crisis support services to assist clients transition from psychiatric emergency services, hospitalization and incarceration, into the community. THREE -YEAR PLAN PROGRAM PRIORITIES San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 32 of 66 THREE -YEAR PROGRAM P LAN FY 2017 -2020 Welfare and Institutio ns Code Section (WIC) \u00a7 5847 states that county mental health programs shall prepare and submit a Three -Year Program and Expenditure Plan (Plan) that addresses each MHSA component and include expenditure projections. The San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Pl an aligns with the Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) of the San Mateo County Health System's commitment a holistic view to the health and well -being of individuals; placing high value in care coordination, collaboration and integration, preven tion and early intervention, data -driven interventions, cost control, quality improvement, and meaningful outcomes. The following pages describe the MHSA Three -Year Plan programs and priorities developed taking specific priorities identified through stake holder input from previous years, new priorities identified through this year's Community Program Planning process, and t he fiscal projections for the next three years. Our multi -year approach facilitates stability, ensures a balanced approach when consid ering programmatic changes, and utilizes higher revenue years to cushion lower revenue years. COMMUNITY SERVICE AN D SUPPORTS (CSS) CSS provides direct treatment and recovery services to individuals of all ages living with serious mental illness or emotio nal disturbance with a focus on unserved and underserved populations. CSS is the largest MHSA component, approximately 75 -80% of MHS A funding. There are three different service categories; Full Service Partnerships (FSP), System Development (SD), and Outr each and Engagement (O&E). At least 51% of CSS funds must be spent on FSPs and focus on unserved and underserved populations. FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP (FSP) FSPs include 24 hours a day, 7 days a week services; peer supports; high staff to client ratios for intensive behavioral health treatment including medications; linkage to housing; supported education and employment; treatment fo r cooccurring disorders; skills -based interventions, among others. The target population for FSPs include, high risk chil dren and youth who would otherwise be placed in a group home; seriously mentally ill and dually diagnosed adults including those elig ible for diversion from criminal justice incarceration; incarcerated individuals; persons placed in locked facilities who c an succeed in the community with intensive supports; and individuals with frequent emergency room visits, hospitalizations, and homel essness; and seriously mentally ill older adults at risk of or currently institutionalized who could live in a community se tting with intensive supports. The c urrent CSS FSP component categor ies will continue through FY 2022-23, as follows : San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 33 of 66 Children and Y outh Full Service Partnerships - helps our highest risk children and youth with serious emotional disorders remain in their communities and with their families or caregivers while attending school and reducing involvement in juvenile justice and child welf are. Integrated clinic -based FSP services for the Central/South Youth Clinic (outpatient), as well as the integrated FSP f or intensive school -based services, school -based milieu services, and the non-public school setting, will continue. FSPs for children and youth will also serve youth placed in foster care temporarily outside of the County to support and stabilize youth in the foster home, support the foster family, and facilitate the return of the youth to San Mateo County. The Children and Youth FSP slots were decreased a total of 35 slots across all programs below, due to decreased demand on services. FSP services (exc luding out -of-county foster care) also experienced decreases in referrals from Human Services Agency and Probation. Since the decrea se, there has been progress made with timeliness of engagement, units of service and providers seeming more willing to refe r. The slots allotted will be revisited if programs begin to increase to near or at capacity.

TAY FSPs helps reduce involuntary hospitalizations, homelessness, and involvement in the juvenile justice system. TAY FSPs will continue to provide enhanced supported education services to TAY wit h emotional and behavioral difficulties and/or substance use issues. Outreach activities engage TAY in educationa l or vocational activities for educational plans and employment. Housing services for TAY will provide housing subsidies and a small cluster o f apartments. Teaching daily living skills, medication management, household safety/cleanliness, budgeting, and roommate negation skills are a part of the treatment and education of the youth .

The overall goal of the adult FSPs is to divert from the criminal j ustice system and/or acute and long -term institutional levels of care (locked facilities) seriously men tally ill and dually diagnosed individuals who can succeed in the community with sufficient structure and support. The goal of the FSP is to facilitate o r offer \"whatever it takes\" to ensure that consumers remain in the least restrictive setting possible t hrough the provision of a range of community -based services and supports deliver ed by a multidisciplinary team. A housing program provides FSP members st able housing by providing additional oversight and support to enable members who might otherwise be at risk of losing their housing to stay consistently housed. This also includes some supplementing of residential care facilities for clients who require t his level of supervision and services.

Additionally, a comprehensive continuum of services can include pre-housing engagement strategies such as drop -in centers, field services targeting the homeless , and linkages and peer support post -psychiatric emergency, hospitalization and incarceration . As described earlier , a strategic approach to address the input received during the community planning process , was proposed to the MHSA Steering C ommittee. The 22 strategies prioritized through the input sessions were organized under 5 MHSA Strategic Initiatives with the intent to reallocate existing MHSA staff resources to engage stakeholders in planning across the prioritized initiatives. Housing was the Strategic Initiative that most Steering Comm ittee members prioritized . Beginning FY 2020 -21, planning for this Housing initiative will include the following goals : Define a continuum of services for housing Identify gaps at all levels of support o r intensity of housing needs Identify expected outcomes and activities/strategies that will support a comprehensive housing continuum for individuals with mental health challenges.

PEI emphasizes improving timely access to services for underserved populations and r educing the 7 negativ e outcomes of untreated mental illness; incarcerations; school failure or dropout; unemployment; prolonged suffering; homelessness; and removal of children from their homes. Service categories include: Early Intervention programs provide treatmen t and other services and interventions, including relapse prevention, to address and promote recovery and related functional outcomes for a mental illness early in its emergence. Services shall not exceed eighteen months, unless t he individual receiving th e service is identified as experiencing first onset of a serious mental illness or emotional disturbance with psychotic features, in which case early intervention services shall not exceed four years. Prevention programs reduce ri sk factors for developing a potentially serious mental illness and build protective factors for individuals whose risk of developing a serious mental illness is greater than average and, as applicable, their parents, caregivers, and other family members. S ervices may include relaps e prevention and universal strategies. Outreach for Recognition of Early Signs of Mental Illness to families, employers, primary care health care providers, and others to recognize the early signs of potentially severe and disabli ng mental illnesses. Access and Linkage to Treatment are activities to connect individuals with severe mental illness as early in the onset of these conditions as practicable, to medically San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 39 of 66 necessary care and treatment, including, but not limited to, care provided by county mental health programs.

San Mateo County will continue to contribute 2% of PEI funding for sustainability of these projects. INNOVATION (INN) INN projects are designed and implemented for a d efined time period (not more than 5 years) and evaluated to introduce a behavioral health practice or approach that is new; make a change to an existing practice, including application to a different populat ion; apply a promising community -driven practice or approach that has been successful in non -behavioral health; and has not demonstrated its effectiveness (through mental health literature). The State requires submission and approval of INN plans prior to use of funds. Utilizing MHSA funding for sustai nability of INN Projects is part of the MHSA Three -Year Plan comprehensive Community Program Planning (CPP) process. Following are the c urrent INN projects , the end date for INN funding and current sustaina bility plan given the anticipated decreases in re venue : Innovation Project Innovation Funding Ending Sustainability Plan Neurosequential Model of Therapeutics (NMT) in Adult System of Care June 30, 2020 One-time funding through June 30, 2022 Health Ambassador Program for Youth June 30, 2020 One-time funding through June 30, 2022 San Mateo County Pride Center June 30, 2021 One-time funding through June 30, 2022 Help@Hand (Tech Suite) Extended to June 30, 2023 To be determined San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 45 of 66 New Innovation Projects On April 7, 2020, the San Mateo County Board of S upervisors (BoS) approved the 5 project ideas we submitted to the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) in February for approval.

A WET 10 -Year Impact and Sustainability Report was released and presented to our local mental health board, the Mental Health and Substance Use Recov ery Commission on February 7, 2018 recommending $500,000 per year to sustain the most effective and impactful elements of WET. The sustainability plan was approved and submitted as part of the FY 2017 -20 MHSA Three Year Plan. More recent developments in clude the following : The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development (OSHPD), in coordination with the California Behavioral Health Planning Council (CBHPC), is charged with the development of a WET Plan every five years to address the needs of th e behavioral health workfo rce statewide . In February 2019, OSHPD released a 2020 -2025 MHSA WET Five -Year Plan. Implementation of the Five-Year WET Plan will occur through a Regional Partnership framework. Regional Partnerships will be funded to implement strategies in pipeline deve lopment, undergraduate scholarships, education stipends, and educational loan repayment s. San Mateo County will participate in the Bay Area Regional Partnership and has allocated a required match in the amount of $200,000 one-time monies approved through a community planning process and submitted in our FY 2019 -20 MHSA Annual Update. A San Mateo County MHSA Thr ee-Year WET Plan , FY 2020 -2023 has been developed to guide implementation of local strategies . The Three -Year WET Plan is in alignment with statewid e priorities, build s off of the current plan and was developed in collaboration with stakeholders, provider s and community partners, to identify areas of need, strengths, opportunities for improvement and recommendations for future funding . Following are the 4 key Priority Recommendations moving forward: Priority Recommendation #1 Increase in one WET team position classification in order to adequately support the existing WET strategies. Moving forward, BHRS recommends the following workforce staffing stru cture: A WET Director: Provides oversight of the WET Program planning and impl ementation and related WET workgroups/committees including statewide representation; evaluation; facilitation of the Workforce Development and Education Committee (WDEC) and the Practice Evaluation Committee (evidence -based practices); and San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 48 of 66 participation in several BHRS Workgroups related to supporting BHRS strategic initiatives. A WET Community Program Specialist: Provides oversight of clinical and Office of Diversity ad Equity ( ODE) internship programs, the Cultural Competency Stipend Internship Program a nd the Cultural Humility Training Cohort. A WET Community Program Specialist (new - previously an Office Specialist) : Coordinates training/education needs, documentation, and ev aluation for all WET Programs and trainings; administers the Learning Manageme nt System for all BHRS trainings including the new learning management system to support enhanced online training opportunities. Priority Recommendation # 2 Add a Supervising Pee rs training to support Peer Integration strategies to that lead to system transformation . The Supervising Peers training will be focused on developing the skills and knowledge needed to apply recovery -oriented, trauma -informed, and culturally relevant approaches to the supervision of peers and family support workers. The training w ill be followed with standardization of peer and family support workers' critical role in behavioral health care services. Priority Recommendation # 3 Provide ongoing funding for peer -led and focused trainings. The following trainings will be offered begin ning FY 2020 -21 utilizing $100,000 in one -time funding that has been approved through a community planning process and submitted in our FY 2019 -20 MHSA Annual Update. Stakeholder s have prioritized this across various strategies to be included in the MHSA T hree - Year Plan's ongoing budget. Peer Services Training . Provide a standardized curriculum in San Mateo County to support peers in developing the ability, skills, knowledge , and values needed to deliver support services in behavioral health care settings (county, community -based, peer -run agencies, etc.). Training competencies will be drawn from established organizations and research on Peer Certification and training curricu la development across the state and customized through a local San Mateo County stakeholder input process. Additional key values in San Mateo County that will be included are principles of recovery, trauma -informed care, cultural humility , and client empow erment. Community Advocacy for Peers . Training will be designed to e mpower clients and family members to advocate for themselves and their communities and to bring the powerful voices of those with lived experience to behavioral health decision -making spa ces. San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 49 of 66 Training participants will develop skills related to giving public comment, effective advocacy , and understanding government organizational structures . Clients and family members will be provide d initial support (e.g. , completing applications/intervie ws if applicable) and list of local opportunities for participation in decision -making boards, commissions, committees, and other county bodies. Documentation for Peer Workers . This training will help participants d evelop the skills and knowledge needed fo r documentation including understanding billing codes and writing progress notes . Priority Recommendation # 4 Given stakeholder interest in a local educational loan forgiveness program, it is recommended that MHSA fund a local e ducational loan forgiveness p rogram for hard -to-fill positions including bilingual and culturally/ethnically diverse clinical positions . While this was not prioritized by the MHSA Steering Committee as part of the FY 2020 -23 MHSA Three -Year Plan, it was the highest priority for Workf orce needs. The OSHPD Regional Partnerships may offer an opportunity to supplement a local San Mateo County educational loan forgiveness program but this is pending regional approval. Please see Appendix 8 for the complete MHSA Three -Year WET Plan, which includes a description of ongoing workforce strategies and a summary of stakeholder input and prioritizations. CAPITAL FACILITIES & TECHNOLOGY NEEDS (C FTN) In the early implementation years of MHSA, t hrough a robust stakeholder process , it was decided to focus all resources of this component to fund eClinical Care, an integrated business and clinical information system (electronic health record) as well as ongoing technical support. The system continues to be improved and expanded in order to help BHRS better serve the clients and families of the San Mateo County behavioral health stakeholder community. Until recently, we had not allocated funding to CFTN. The Plan to Spend One -Time Available Funds includes CFTN priorities to renovate the following Count y-owned facilities, the South San Francisco Clini c, the East Palo Alto Clinic and Casia House and Cordilleras . ANNUAL UPDATE FY 2020 -2021 Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 51 of 66 ANNUAL UPDATE FY 20 20-21 Welfare and Institutions Code Section (WIC) \u00a7 5847 states that county mental health programs shall prepare an d submit an Annual Updates for Mental Health Service Act (MHSA) programs and expenditures. The Annual Update includes any changes to the Plan and expenditures. San Mateo County submitted the most recent data for FY 2018 -19 in our recently submitted FY 2019-20 Annual Update . The Annual Update was approved by our local Board of Supervisors on April 7, 2020. Given we have no new program data to sub mit, this current Annual Update will focus on updates to MHSA implementation and expenditures only. PLAN TO SPEND ONE -TIME FUNDS In FY 2019 -20 Annual Update, San Mateo County submitted a Plan to Spend Available One -Time Fund s, included in Appendix 9 as a reference . As of July 1, 2018, San Mateo County had $12.5 million unspent available one -time funding to advance MHSA program priorities ($3.9 of the $12.5 million must be spent in Prevention and Early Intervention projects). Funding prio rities for the $12.5 million available one -time funds were developed in collaboration with stakeholders and presented to th e MHSA Steering Committee . On November 6, 2019 , the Mental Health and Substance Use Commission held a public hearing, closed the 30 -day public comment period , reviewed the public comments, and subsequently voted to submit the plan to the Board of Supervis ors for approval. The final Plan to Spend was submitted and approved by our Board of Supervisors on April 7, 2020 along with the FY 2019 -20 Annual Update. San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 52 of 66 The Plan to Spend included a few priorities in FY 2019 -20 as summarized below. Due to COVID - 19 pa ndemic, many of the proposed expenditures are delayed to FY 20/21. We have made significant progress on developing a Comprehensive, Continuous, Integrated System of Care model for Full Service Partn erships through a multi -county FSP project facilitated by Third Sector consultants and CalMHSA administration . This project is a proposed 4.5 year Multi - County FSP Innovation Project between the following Counties: Fresno , Sacramento , San Mateo , San Bernardino , Siskiyou and Ventura . In San Mateo County we are n ot using MHSA INN funds for this project as this was better aligned with one -time priorities. We intend to use unspent MHSA CSS funds as designated and approved through the Plan to Spend Available One - Time Funding local community program planning process to meet a similar purpose and set of objectives as the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project. The Multi -County FSP Innovation Project are available in Appendix 10. Priority Item FY 19/20 Implementation Updates System Improvements - Core MHSA Services Reco very oriented, co -occurring capacity of FSPs (Comprehensive, Continuous, Integrated System of Care model) $500,000 San Mateo County joined a statewide, m ulti-county FSP project to develop and implement new data -driven strategies to better coordinate FSP se rvice delivery, operations, data collection, and evaluation .

Annual PEI Reports San Mateo County has submitted Annual PEI Reports with each MHSA Annual Update. The most recent Annual PEI Report included data outcomes form FY 2018 -19 and was submitted and approved by our local Board of Supervisors on April 7, 2020 along with the FY 2019 -20 Annual Update. Three -Year PEI Evaluation Report Each County is also required to submit a Three -Year PEI Evaluation Report with the first report due by June 30, 2019 and c overing data from FY 2016 -17 and FY 2017 -18. While, we had not submitted our first PEI Evaluation Re port until now , we intend to submit these in a timely manner moving forward and have been taking steps since the new regulations were released in June 2018 to develop the infrastructure for meeting all the data collection requirements including: Hired a li mited -term Community Health Planner in the fall of 2018 to support infrastructure development for PEI reporting. The three -year term for the Community Health Planner will end in the fall of 2021. Updated the annual reporting tool for all PEI programs and contractors to include all demographic and data reporting requirements. Ensured that all PEI programs addressed the required new categories and strategies from the updated PEI regulations including : o Create access to linkage and treatment o Timely access to mental health services for individuals and families from underserved populations o Non -stigmatizing and non -discriminatory Developed an evaluation framewor k for the Office of Diversity and Equity prevention programs including a comprehensive and community informed demographic form for all events, workshops and activities Allocat ed, through a local stakeholder planning process, $200,000 one -time available funds to develop a PEI database or centralized portal for data collection and we look forward to impleme nting this priority next fiscal year (FY) 2020 -21. San Mateo County MHSA Three -Year Plan FY 20/21 -22/23 & Annual Update FY 20/21 Page 55 of 66 Appendix 1 1 includes the complete Three -Year PEI Evaluation Report . Based on the findings of this rep ort, below are some recommended action steps that are included in the report and will allow us to better comply with the new PEI regulations. Contract an external evaluator: Due to limited staffing capacity, an evaluator from an outside agency will be co ntracted to guide the PEI evaluation process, out comes, and implementation of tools. They will work with the Community Health Planner to meet with contract monitors, contract agencies, establish and implement outcome metrics for each of the programs. The s tandardized outcome template will be changed to r eflect specific data requirements. The outcome metrics will be developed with contractors, clients/family members as well as staff to ensure outcomes that they are representative of the work being done, that they fulfill the PEI requirements and are meanin gful to the community. This will enable us to develop an evaluation plan that is culturally competent and includes the perspective of diverse people with lived experience. Hold regular meetings with contrac t monitors: These meetings will be held with each of the contract monitors to update and provide them with the new PEI regulations. It will enable us to gain understand as to their involvement with the contractor, familiarity with the data requirements and establish o versight procedures for data collection. Hold egular meetings with PEI programs and contracted agencies: These meetings will be held with each of the contractors regarding implementation, data collection and analysis. One of the recommendation s from our p revious evaluator was that contract agencies needed training on data collection. These preliminary meetings will serve to gauge the capacity of the agency, obtain feedback on outcome measures and tools proposed, creation of a PEI data base, and review of t he new PEI guidelines as well as updated expectations and potential contract amendments. Develop a PE I database : Currently, data collection is not standardized. Many programs submit annual reports with quantitative data that changes from year to year base d on their capacity/turn over and many outcomes are based on what the agencies deem to be meaningful at the time. With the standardization of outcome metrics and reporting, as well as a centralized data base, it will enable us to make data driv en systems improvements, compare year to year outcomes and comply with PEI regulations. Create formal protocols : Formal written protocols are needed for PEI programs, these protocols would include communication of PEI requirements, clear expectations of what needs to be completed by each program, who is responsible for each task assigned, as well as timelines for all activities. These protocols would specify the expectations around data collection, the role of the contract monitors and reporting expect ations, such as quarterly reports, and annual reports for programming .

Interconnectedness \"Being concerned about other people is especially relevant in today's world. If we consider the complex inter -connected ness of our modern lives, how we depend on others and others depend on us, our outlook will change.

MHSA has been stretched out thinly. There are pros and cons to this. MHSA has been able t o be highly leveraged supporting many areas of need. The cons: it is very difficult to measure the overall impact of MHSA and especially on any specific goals and outcomes. Yet, that's the expectation. It's a lot of money and we should be able to impact broad level outcomes. o While we can't do anything immediately about the legislative requirements and the continued pull and demands on MHSA funding to focus on various issues. We believe that the framework we are proposing will allow us to focus our int ernal re sources in an Initiative area and also provide what is needed for meet the legislative requirements across a spectrum of services. o We can d edicate resources to do more strategic planning around a specific area ; define what a continuum of services would entail ; identify gaps ; and develop logic models to ill ustrate expected outcomes and the specific process/activities that will get us there. The initiative area s we are proposing based on the in put we received are: Housing Crisis Diversion Cultural ly Responsive and Trauma -Informed Systems Community Engagement Integrated Treatment and Recovery Supports o Housing Continuum example ( from Washington Count y, Oregon ) o The Steering Committee will rank the 5 initiatives AND prioritize acr oss all 22 strategies via a survey that will be emailed out after the meeting and d ue by May 8, 2020 . o The priorities will be included in the 3-year plan , which will be posted for 30- day public comment o The youth crisis support strate gy from the previou s plan will remain a prior ity in the new 3-year plan Question & Answer (Q&A)* o Loyd: Regarding mental health and homeless, many homeless don't go into mental health centers. How do we engage homeless in drop -in center? o Response : If we are able to prioritize drop -in center strategie s for homeless, we will make sure to engage communiti es in t his level of detail prior to implementation. For example , a Coastside Wellness Program was prioritized last three -year plan . As a next step, we went to the community and engaged them in conversat ions about what it would take for them to come to a wellness center, what does it need to have , what would outreach look like. This was all prior to releasing an RFP f or funding. We would do a similar process for a h omeless drop in center. o Ellen Darne ll: Excited for mental health substance abuse coalition to be formed. I lived in men tal health county housing. Many people are returning to their addictions. Will there be any consumers on that commission? o Response : A mental health and substa nce use commi ssion already exists, the Mental Health and Sub stance Abuse Recovery Commission . It is our local county board. There is an application process to join the commission and it does include consumers /clients and family members seats that are required to be f illed. o Alan Cochran : What are we going to do about continuing to form relationships with like /m inded agencies - NAMI San Mateo County? I don't want to lose that connection with HOPE program. Further that partnerships. o Response: Collaboration is a core v alue of MHSA . We will always do what we can to allow agencies to participate in project planning . For agencies to receive funding, we have a bidding process that follows any project planning . o Carol Gosho : Can you explain who decides how you get from 100 + ideas to 22 ideas? Who decides what those 22 are? o Response: We ran input sessions and engaged community members in strat egy developme nt. During the input sessions we asked the question, if you had to select one out of all these great i deas that would have the bi ggest impact over the next three years , what would it be? This initial pr ioritiza tion happened during the input sessions We also looked across all the ideas for things that may have come up often but , not necessarily prioritized . All th e strategy ideas and prioritization will be posted. o Stephanie Morales : One of the expansion programs you showed was implemented already - supports for older adults , OASIS. Why is the posit ion only 3 years , is it because it is a three -year plan? o Response: The OASIS expansion included an additional mental health counselor, the decision to make it a limited -term three -year position is a County hiring decis ion, it is not due to the revenue or three -year plan. The other e xpan sion was for the senior peer counsel ing progr am. o Erica Horn : Will the meeting be recorded, and will it be shared? o Response: Yes, and y es. The meeting w ill be posted on the MHSA website , www.scmhealth.org o Michael Lim : The new slide on the slide deck refer red to one -time fun ding . How big is the funding? Is it from revertible funds or back up funds? COVID - 19 funding. o Answer: Yes, the updated slide deck is on th e website now. At the e nd of fiscal year 2018 -2019, we had unspent dollars of about $5.7 mi llion. The proposal is to dedica te th ese unspent funds to support with the impact of COVID -19. We will bring a proposal to the commission durin g the June 3rd meeting for input and 30-day public comment process. 3.

Valerie Abea MHSA 3Year Planning MHSA Strategic Initiatives ns, May 2020 Page | MHSA ThreeYear FY 20/21 to FY 22/23 MHSA Steering Results In an effort to offset the antic ipated lack of new funding, due to COVID19 pandemic and upcoming recession, a strategic appro ach to addressing the input collected during the CPP process was proposed to the MHSA Steer ing Committee on April 29, 2020. T wenty two strategies that we re prioritized by stakeholders were organized under five MHSA Strategic Initiativ es with the intent to reallocate existing MHSA staff resources to engage stakeholders in planning to develop an adaptive strategy direction for these in itiatives. This can be accomplished within the current budget a nd will give us valuable information we need to make info rmed decisions about funding an d next steps once revenue increases.

MHSA emphasizes transformation of the mental health sy stem while improving the quality of life for individuals living with mental illness. In Fiscal Year (FY) 200607 and FY 200708, San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Se rvices (BHRS) received a onet ime MHSA allocation in the amount of $3,437,600, for Workforce Education an d Training (WET) strategi es. A WET 10Year Impact and Sustainability Report was released and presented to our local m ental health board, the Mental Health and Substance Use Recovery Commission on February 7, 2018 recommend ing $500,000 per year to sustain the most effective and impactful elements of WET. The sustaina bility plan was approved and submitted as part of the FY 201720 M HSA Three Year Plan. Statewide, the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Developm ent (OSHPD), in coordination with the California Behavioral Health Planning Council (CBHPC), is charg ed with the development of a WET Plan every five years to address the needs of the behavioral health workforce. Implementation of OSHPD's FiveYear WET Plan will occur through a Regional Partnership fr amework. The Regional Partnerships will be funded to implement strategies in pipeline development, unde rgraduate scholarships, education stipends, and educational loan repayments through a framework t hat engages Regional Partnerships. San Mateo County will participate in the Bay Area Regional Partners hip and has allocated a required match in the amount of $200,000 onetime monies approved through a commu nity planning process and submitted in our FY 201920 MHSA Annual Update. This MHSA ThreeYear WET Plan will guide implementation of WET strategies and activi ties for the 2020 2023 MHSA cycle. This plan is in alignment with statewide prio rities, builds on the current plan developed in collaboration with stakeholde rs, providers and community par tners, and identifies areas of need, strengths, and opportunit ies for improvement. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 2 Stakeholder Participation Summary WET Plan development was guided by a stakeholder engagement pro cess that targeted diverse groups of San Mateo County Behavioral Health and Recovery Services (BHRS) staff and contract agency staff (including peer and family positions), and community stakeholde rs. The input process included key informant interviews, online surveys for BHRS staff and individ uals with lived experience, small remote focus group discussions conducted through the Zoom platform, an d input discussion groups targeting a variety of different stakeholder groups. BHRS directly gathered input from stakeholder groups as part of its broader threeyear MHSA community planning process. BHRS co ntracted an independent consulting firm, Resource Development Associates (RDA), to conduct staff f ocus groups, design and administer the online surveys, and summarize stakeholder needs and recommendat ions. The chart below lists the forums through which information was collected. Table 1.

Through these data collection activities, stakeholders indicated the ne ed to continue to implement and build upon existing WET strategies included in the County's prior WET Plan . Stakeholders identified several priority areas where expanded investment may also increase the capacity of San Mateo County's behavioral health workforce to meet the needs of its diverse communities. Stakeholders highlighted the importance of the following overarching strategies across the four WET com ponents: 1) increasing awareness, accessibility, and impact of trainings for community members an d BHRS staff; 2) developing the behavioral health career pipeline through proactive engagement with educat ional institutions and community organizations and groups; and 3) providing career navigation su pport to existing staff and people with lived experience. A comprehensive breakdown of findings from st akeholder discussions and surveys is presented in Appendix A. MHSA WET Components, Strategies & Priority Recommendations Component: Workforce Staffing Support During stakeholder input discussions, participants frequently s hared their appreciation for the WET t e a m ' s c u r r e n t e f f o r t s w h i l e c a l l i n g f o r a c o n t i n u e d s t r e n g t h e n ing and expansion of programming including increased training offerings and internal career navi gation support. Participants also noted a need to increase staff awareness of existing training opportuni ties, employee support services, and available education and licensing reimbursement opportunities. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 4 BHRS WET programming provides education/training and workforce development opportunities to San Mateo County behavioral health st aff, contractors, providers, c lients/consumers and family members. The WET programming also works in part nership with other BHRS strat egic initiatives including: Developing an inclusive, equitabl e organization culture and env ironment; Promoting cultural humility and racial equity; Developing best practices for the treatment of cooccurring men tal health and substance use conditions; Building a comprehensive suicide prevention program; Honoring lived experience in employment; Creating traumainformed systems of care; and Decreasing stigma. WET operates under the Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) and is supervised by the ODE Director. This organizational structure enhances the focus of WET to embed cul tural humility, as well as to support the core values of MHSA and allows for a systemic approach to workf orce strategies. The WET Team currently includes three positions: the WE T Director, a Community Program Specialist, and an Office Specialist. Moving forward, BHRS recommends the following workforce staffin g structure: A WET Director: Provides oversight of the WET Program planning and implementation and related WET workgroups/committees including statewide representation; e valuation; facilitation of the Workforce Development and Education Committee (WDEC) and the Pr actice Evaluation Committee (evidencebased practices); and participation in seve ral BHRS Workgroups related to supporting BHRS strategic initiatives. A WET Community Program Specialist: Provides oversight of clini cal and Office of Diversity ad Equity (ODE) internship programs, the Cultural Competency Stipe nd Internship Program and the Cultural Humility Training Cohort. A WET Community Program Specialist: Coordinates training/educat ion needs, documentation, and evaluation for all WET Programs and trainings; administers the Learning Management System for all BHRS trainings including the new learning management sy stem to support enhanced online training opportunities. As the San Mateo County population continues to grow and divers ify and client needs are becoming more complex, a workforce that is culturally humble, provides client /familydriven mental health services, and adheres to the values of wellness, recovery, and resilience is critical. The demands on the staffing for the WET program have increased in scope and scale. WET supported 98 trainings in FY 201819, triple the MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 5 average number of trainings in pr evious years. Prior to the COV I D 1 9 p a n d e m i c , W E T s t a f f w e r e implementing improved technologies to provide increased online and webinarstyle trainings, which has now been elevated by the shelterinplace orders. The WET Team will require an increase in one position's classification in order to: adequately support the existing WET strategies; respond to stakeholder recommendations to continue to strengthen and expand WET progra mming; build infrastructure to implement new technologies; maintain a wellorganized, effectiv e, consistent workforce program; and conduct reporting and evaluation o f BHRS training activities. Component: Training for System Transformation During stakeholder engagement activities, participants shared a desire to expand opportunities for clinical and nonclinical staff to attend Countyprovided/funded trainin gs by increasing the frequency of training offerings and/or by increasing training accessibility (e.g., re mote participation). Participants also recommended providing ongoing followup and training refreshers (in individual and group settings/supervision) and ongoing consultation on training conc epts to ensure learnings are successfully applied in practice. BHRS staff members, community providers, and individuals with l ived experience highlighted the importance of trainings in traumainformed care and cultural hu mility/responsiveness . They indicated these training areas as priorities for all levels of clinical a nd nonclinical staff, emphasizing that these training areas promote supportiv e, communicative, and inclusive working environments for staff within the BHRS network of services. To support BHRS providers in successfully applying learnings in practice, WET will offer training refreshers and ongoing consultation on training concepts. WET will continu e and expand its practice of offering foundationallevel courses followed by advancedlevel learning opportunities with specific focus on the application of the training concepts to specific communities or settings. Also, WET will provide technical assistance to staff and provider s for implementation. For examp le, WET provides a foundationallevel Motivational Interviewing training, which is followed by smalle r coaching sessions where providers can present cases to train ers for consultation. In addition, WET, in collaboration with the BHRS Quality Improv ement Committee, expanded the accessibility of its training program by adding BHRS contracted providers to the Learning Management System to remove stated barriers to registration for trainings and documentation of contract requirements. The WET Team launched a virtualbased service to increase the amount of onlinebased training and education. These services will continue as priorit ies for BHRS. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 6 Having a wide breadth of trainings is key to building staff cap acity to provide modalit ies and services that are effectively tailored to the C ounty's array of racial, ethni c, and linguistic communities. The WET team supports a systemic transformation approach. In order to transf orm systems, training begins with foundational knowledge and extends to specialized topics. Train ings initiate dialogue, personal impacts, and the beginning of organizational culture shifts. WET goes be yond providing training topics and works collaboratively with BHRS teams to ensure adequate policies and procedures, evidencebased practice, leadership accountability, and intentional linkages to quality improvement goals advance genuine system transformation. Cultural humility, recovery, traumainformed ca re, standards of care, cooccurring and other integrated care, and lived experience integration are all a r e a s o f f o c u s f o r B H R S s y s t e m transformation. These will conti nue as priorities for BHRS as d escribed below. Cultural Humility Four hours of cultural humilityrelated training are required f or all staff on an annual basis as per an ODE sponsored policy: Cultural Humility, Equity and Inclusion Frame work; Implementation of CLAS Standards. Trainings are intended to increase understanding of health ineq uities in the community; provide instruction in culturally and linguistically responsive service s; and to increase access, capacity, and understanding by partnering with community groups and resources . BHRS makes educational and training activities consumers, family members, providers, and those work ing and living in the community. In addition, staff who have direct client contact are required to complete the Working Effectively with Interpreters training upon hire a nd at minimum a refresher opti on every three years. The Health Equity Initiatives work with the WET team to create and support trainings to address special populations and appropriately serve marginalized communities, e xamples include: Native American Mental Health: H istorical Trauma and Healing Pr actices Working with Filipino Youth Transgender 101: Creating an Inclusive Community TraumaInformed Care Traumainformed care is a system wide orientation that takes in to consideration the pervasive impact of trauma by implementing training, practices, and policies that c ontribute to a safer environment for healing and recovery. BHRS has an active trauma learning collab orative (TLC) dedicated to improving the behavioral health system and the resourcesharing across progra ms and communities. Additionally, many of the TLC members are trained to teach Trauma 101. The WET Pro gram has presented trainings that target specific populations and providers in our efforts to mov e toward a traumainformed system including the following: Introduction to Trauma Informe d Care in a Clinic Setting Mindfulness for Trauma impacted Youth MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 7 Providers Vicarious Trauma and Toxic Stress: Cumulative Impact of Supporting Oppressed Communities Standard of Care Multiple EvidenceBased, CommunityDefined, and Promising Pract ice trainings occur over the course of the year. A Selection of EvidencedBased and CommunityDefined Practice Policy was passed by the BHRS Quality Improvement Committee. This policy aims to provide an i nclusive process for the selection of clinical and nonclinical interventions that can be utilized th roughout BHRS. A Practice Evaluation Committee reviews proposal for int erventions. Examples include: Functional Family Therapy is a familybased intervention with youth in the criminal just ice system focused on family and consumer st rengths to help youth gain con trol of their behavior. TraumaFocused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a model that integrates cognitive and behavioral interventions with traditional child abuse therapies and focuse s on enhancement of interpersonal trust and empowerment. Dialectical Behavior Therapy is a psychotherapy that focuses on addressing negative cogniti ons and intense emotions by practici ng skill development to effecti vely deal with distress. Cooccurring and Other Integrated Care BHRS is a recoveryoriented system of care. Specifically, many of our programs and interventions are characterized by SAMSHA's guiding principles of recovery. The f ocus of the recoveryoriented trainings is to provide education with attent ion to substance use disorder ( SUD) providers and the unique needs of populations impacted by SUD. The WET team partners with Alcohol and Other Drug (AOD) staff to offer several training opportunities that support both providers and people with SUD lived experience. WET also provides courses on Relapse Prevention and Motivational In terviewing. Additionally, the WET Program administers continuing education for providers with SUD certification. Peer Integration Integrating individuals with lived experience in all aspects of behavioral health care is discussed in the next section, Training for/by Consumers and Family Members. An additional component of Peer Integration strategies that can support system transformation is training for Supervising Peers focused on developing the skills and knowledge needed to apply recoveryoriented, traumainformed, and culturally relevant approaches to the supe rvision of peers and family support workers. The training will be followed with standardization of peer and family support workers' critical role in behavioral health care services. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 8 Component: Training for/by Clients and Family Members During stakeholder engagement activities, participants voiced t he importance of empowering individuals and families with lived experience within the BHRS continuum of services, expanding culturally responsive community messaging, and facilitating ongoing knowledge exchang es that destigmatize mental illness and draw on cultural understandings of healing. Similar to findings related to staff training, participants emphasized the importance of traumainformed care and cultural responsiveness as training areas for individuals with livedexperience. T h i s W E T c o m p o n e n t i s f o c u s e d o n c r e a t i n g p a t h w a y s f o r c l i e n t s and family members with lived experience to participate in the behavioral health workforce. C lients and family members receive training by peers focused on knowledge and skills in the area of stigma reduction, advocacy, and empowerment to inspire participants to share their stories as a means to bo th advocate and support their recovery, reduce shame, isolation and increase confidence. The Office of Consumer and Family Affairs (OCFA), a team of diverse consumers and family members with lived experie nce, will have oversight of this component. Lived Experience Academy (LEA). Participants learn how to share their stories to empower themselves, reduce stigma, and educate others about behavioral health conditions. The program upholds the core value that lived experience is its own form of expertise, and that integrating people with lived experience into the workforce is a vital type of workforce diversity. It includes an annual training and Speakers' Bureau. Graduates of the LEA a re eligible to join the Speakers' B u r e a u a n d r e c e i v e a n i n c e n t i v e t o p r e s e n t t h e i r s t o r i e s w i t h b ehavioral health staff and community members at trainings and community events. Other peerled trainings . This includes Recovery and Peer Support 101, Inspired at Work trainings for BHRS Peer Support Workers/Family Partners, Wellness Recover y Action Plans, etc. During various MHSA input processes including this process, cli ents/consumers and family members and peer workforce have voiced the need for ongoing, sustained trai nings focused on developing the skills to work effectively in the behavioral health workforce, advocate e ffectively during public meetings, and develop the infrastructure withi n BHRS to support peer staff de velopment and growth. As a starting point, the following trainings will be offered be ginning FY 202021 utili zing $100,000 in one time funding has been approved through a community planning pro cess and submitted in our FY 201920 MHSA Annual Update. Moving forward, the recommendation is to fu nd this ongoing and stakeholders MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 9 have prioritized this across various other strategies to be inc luded in the MHSA ThreeYear Plan's ongoing budget. Peer Services Training. Provide a standardized curriculum in San Mateo County to suppor t peers in developing the ability, skills, knowledge, and values needed to deliver support services in behavioral health care settings (county, communitybased, peer run agencies, etc.). Training competencies will be drawn from established organizations and r esearch on Peer Certification and training curricula development across the state and customi zed through a local San Mateo County stakeholder input process. Additional key values in San Mateo County that will be included are principles of recovery, traum ainformed care, cultural humi lity, and client empowerment. Community Advocacy for Peers. Training will be designed to empower clients and family members to advocate for themselves and their communities and to bring t he powerful voices of those with lived experience to behavioral health decisionmaking spaces. T raining participants will develop skills related to giving public comment, effective advocacy, an d understanding government organizational structures. Clients and family members will be p rovided initial support (e.g., completing applications/interviews if applicable) and list of l ocal opportunities for participation in decisionmaking boards, commi ssions, committees, and other c ounty bodies. Documentation for Peer Workers. This training will help participants develop the skills and knowledge needed for documentation including understanding bill ing codes and writing progress notes. Component: Behavioral Health Career Pathways Programs Stakeholders recommended promoting and expanding education path ways and career advancement opportunities for clinical and no nclinical staff through early career outreach, career mentorship, and financial incentives. Focus groups and surveys responses partic ularly indicated the importance of proactive engagement strategies during all phases of the behavi oral health career pathway. Participants recommended increasing the pipeline of bilingual and culturally /ethnically diverse clinical positions by targeting transition age youth (TAY) with career outreach at hi gh schools, universities, and community groups. For recruitment of a diverse clinical and nonclinical workforce, participants recommended conducting outreach to bilingual individuals in community locat ions; providing additional incentives through robust employee wellness benefits; and continuing to offer and expand upon existing scholarship and financial incentives. BHRS stakeholders also highlighted th e importance of career guidance and support for current employees (especially for those in shortte rm positions) to ensure awareness of available resources offered by the County and State for educati onal advancement, FY 202023 May 2020 | 10 Given the limited capacity of WET staff and to ensure appropria te outreach and programming for pipeline development and recruitment stra tegies, the WET Director will p articipate in the OSHPD Regional Partnerships to leverage regional efforts, which will be funded by OSHPD. As mentioned earlier, San Mateo County has allocated the re quired match to participate in the program. The Behavioral Health Career Pat hways Program aims to recruit, hire, support, and retain diverse staff in behavioral health careers. The following are ongoing strategies that are supported by stakeholder feedback and will continue: Internship Programs including BHRS Clinical Internships. BHRS partners and contracts with graduate schools in the Bay Area to provide education, training , and clinical practice for their students at various behavioral health worksites in the county t o provide training opportunities for psychology interns, mastersleve l trainees, alcohol and drug ce rtificate program students, and psychiatric residents each year. Students are welcome to attend any of the five didactic training seminars throughout the county. T here are bimonthly psychiatri c grand rounds that are open to all staff and students. Regular inservice training and special ized staff training are also available for students to attend. In recent years, additional skills trai ning was added to the internships in the following areas: wellness a nd recovery; crisis response, su icide and trauma; cultural humility; integrated care; and cooccurring mental health and substance u se disorders. BHRS New Hire Orientation. The BHRS NewHire Orientation consists of a series of three ses sions that take place over the course of a few months after a new emp loyee is hired. The goal of the orientation is to help new staff learn mandated requirements, u nderstand how BHRS works and connects to other agencies and departments, meet and learn from BHRS managers, explore the possibilities for career advancement, and feel invested in and supported by BHRS as an organization. BHRS Mentorship Program. BHRS Mentoring serves to help staff build professional competen cies, develop leadership skills, support career advancement, and prev ent job burnout. The mentoring process provides a wealth of accumulated knowledge and wisdom, as well as professional stimulation and growth. It is also an opportunity to contribute to the development of the workforce. The mentoring program is designed to address many le vels of needs, including sharing of experience, information, and skills development. Program goa ls include the following: o Develop knowledge, skills, and at titudes of effective leaders; o Develop confidence and interpersonal skills; o Raise issues, tackle challenges, nurture growth; o Provide a professional role model; o Obtain professional support; o Foster longterm development; o Gain appreciation of managem and leadership issues; MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 11 o Develop appreciation of respecti ve roles, and th eir rewards and challenges; o Provide an opportunity to reflec t on one's assumptions and beli efs; o Expand professional networks; o Build networks with variations in functions, position, demograp hics; o Provide mutual benefit through exchange of information; o Advance people of diverse backgrounds to leadership levels, and /or retain them in the workforce; and o Enhance employee engagement, job satisfaction and contribution. Additionally, to respond to stakeholder request to increase awa reness of available resources offered by the County and State for educational advancement, certification s, and licensure, the WET team will collaborate with the BHRS Human Resources team to create greate r understanding during the County orientation process and the BHRS New Hire Orientation meetings. In addition, the WET team will produce content with information about W ETassociated trainings and sup port for BHRS communications. Component: Financial Incentives Through surveys and stakeholder input discussions, stakeholders rated educational loan forgiveness programs a s t h e t o p s t r a t e g y t o s u p p o r t t h e r e c r u i t m e n t a n d r e t e n t i o n o f a d i v e r s e w o r k f o r c e . Educational loan repayment assist ance and support with costs re lated to certifications and licensure were also indicated as essential incentives for career advancement a mong those already employed by the County and its network of providers. Stakeholders frequently re commended increasing providers' awareness and understanding of existing loan forgiveness and av ailable education reimbursement programs during early career out reach efforts and in existing r ecruitment strategies. The following are ongoing strategies that are supported by stak eholder feedback and will continue. Cultural Competence Stipend Internship Program (CSIP). Selected interns receive a $5,000 stipend as part of our Cultural Competency Stipend Internship Program ( CCSIP) for their contributions to improving the cultural competence and cultural humility of our system of care. Up to 10 trainees are selected based on their bicultural/bilingual capabilities, with preference given to those who identify or have experience working with special populations. C CSIP interns are required to interact with and learn from members of the Health Equity Initi atives and other systemschange initiatives. Lived Experience Scholarship. The scholarship provides up to $500 for clients/consumers or family members to pursue their academic goals toward a clinical, admin istrative, or management career in behavioral health. Applicants must be current or former BHRS clients/consumers or family MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 12 members, residents of San Mateo County, and registered for at l east six units in a vocational, 2 year college, 4year college, credential, or graduate program. Given stakeholder interest in a local educational loan forgiven ess program, it is recommended that MHSA fund a local educational loan forgiveness program for hardtof ill positions including bilingual and culturally/ethnically diverse clin ical positions. The OSHPD Reg ional Partnerships may offer an opportunity to supplement a local San Mateo County educational loan forgive ness program, but this is pending regional approval. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 13 Appendix A: Stakeholder Input Findings: San Mateo County Workforce Education and Training (WET) Plan RDA prepared the following summary of stakeholder findings base d on a synthesis of data collection activities (stakeholder input di scussions and ke y informant int erviews, focus groups, and online surveys). Staff Recruitment Overall, respondents to the Provider Survey viewed their clinics and programs as \"somewhat able\" to recruit the staff necessary to meet the community's needs. This perception align ed with the focus group results. Participants shared the perception that recruitment and retention of qualified personnel for shortterm/temporary positions is a challenge . They shared that experienced and/or qualified candidates are likely disincentivized from accepting these type of positions due to the lack of long term security. Participants shared that there is a broad need to increase linguistic and ethnic/cultural diversity of the behavioral health workforce to adequately serve the coun ty's communities. Specifically, participants noted: More Spanishspeaking clinicians are needed. There is inadequate representation of people of color , specifically African Americans, in clinical and staff positions clinics and locations that serve p eople of color (e.g., the clinic that serves justiceinvolved youth). This can be a barrier to e ngaging hardtoengage groups. In some parts of the county, limited visibility and interaction with BHRS outside of direct services limits exposure to the behavioral health field for youth and available employment opportunities for eligible community members. The majority of respondents to the Provider Survey indicated th at all of the listed recruitment strategies for a diverse workforce were important, including ea rly career outreach, scholarships, stipends, and loan forgiveness programs. However, educational loan forgiveness programs were rated as the top priority most frequently . MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 14 Participants recommended increasing the pipeline of bilingual a nd culturally/ethnically diverse clinical positions through expansion of targeted relationships with high schools, universities, and community groups . Example strategies included: o Cultivate relationship with Santa Clara University's Bilingual MFT program track to establish internship pipeline. o Engage relevant student groups at local colleges to increase aw areness of behavioral health field and learning pathways. o Conduct assemblies and participat e in career fairs at local hig h schools. Participants recommended raising awareness of currently availab le peer personnel and lived experience positions for bilingual community members through preferred, accessible means of communication . Example strategies included: o P h y s i c a l j o b p o s t i n g s i n c o m m u n i ty locations (grocery stores, c ommerce centers, community events). o Build/leverage relationships with community gatekeepers and eld ers to increase \"word ofmouth\" communications and to r aise awareness of existing opp ortunities. Staff Retention & Career Advancement Most providers who responded to the survey viewed their programs/clinics as able to retain staff \"somewhat\" or \"to a great extent.\" These results appeared more positive than the perception shared by focus group participants. Most providers who responded to the survey rated their programs/clinics as \"somewhat\" able to successfully support individuals to advance their careers in the behavioral health workforce . Participants in focus groups indicated that there is inconsistent awareness and utilization of education reimbursement and loan forgiveness opportunities acro ss the County. Participants also reported difficulty in utilizing education reimbursement programs due to a challenging application processes that include what they view a s \"excessive\" documentation of classes and hours, and limited eligibility for reimbursement. Hiring for shortterm/temporary positions means that qualified and committed staff positions (clinical and nonclinical) are frequently lost, despite ongoing community need for their services and contributions. Shortterm clinician positions can be especi ally detrimental to clients as a therapeutic relationship, developed over time, is lost. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 15 Participants shared a perception that San Mateo County salaries and benefits are lacking when compared to neighboring counties . Given the current cost of liv ing and rising housing costs, participants noted that there is greater incentive to work for neighboring counties . Participants shared the importance of a healthy and supportive work environment to support staff retention and prevent burnout. While many cited having su pervisors and colleagues that effectively contribute to their experience of a healthy, vibran t workplace that keeps them at their job, some participants reported unhealthy work environments att ributed directly to supervisors' behavior or lack of ability to m anage conflict and team dynamic s. Providers viewed all of the survey retention strategies listed, including fellowships and licensure support, as important. Among staff considering licensure or already licensed , educational loan repayment assistance and financial incentives for those who remain in the workforce were rated as the top priority most frequently . Among staff not considering licensure , financial incentives for career advancement and scholarships for certificate programs for individuals with live d experience were rated as the top priority most frequently . Participants recommended keeping qualified staff who are in limitedterm positions (inte rns, extrahelp, parttime) in the County pipeline . Example strategies included: Establish an internal Career Navigator position (or assign rela ted responsibilities to an existing staff) to engage departing staff about other opportuni ties, vacancies within the County and contracted provider network. Proactively engage limitedterm staff sooner about their depart ure dates and additional opportunities that may be ava ilable within the County. Participants recommended increasing awareness and understanding of available loan forgiveness and education reimbursement programs among current County employees and featuring these incentives more prominently in recruitment effo rts/materials. Example strategies included: Establish a point person within BHRS to explain loan forgivenes s and educational incentive programs and application processes. Increase supervisors' awareness of available loan forgiveness a nd education reimbursement opportunities to relay information for staff and provide support. Participants recommended providing benefits comparable to other counties to support quality of life and wellbeing. Example strategies included: MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 16 Discounted gym memberships, increased PTO, greater flexibility of work hours. For those with lived experiences, current and past trauma, and secondary trauma, offer additional mental health support beyond limited number of EAP c ounseling sessions and more flexible PTO. Participants recommended promoting and expanding education pathways and career advancement opportunities for clinical and nonclinical staff through financial incentiv es and career mentorship. Example strategies included: Expand career counseling and supervisor and peer support especi ally for those with lived experience. Expand grant opportunities for continued education/employment i n peer counseling for those with lived experiences. Provide stipends that cover all of the hours that clinical inte rns are providing services. Participants recommended promoting healthy, inclusive work environments through continue d skill development for supervisors. Provide supervisors or any other staff management positions wit h more training and skill development relating to group dynamics, conflict/resolution, and cultural competency . Input session participants highlighted the need to focus on selfcare and resilience among providers who serve clie nts with complex needs. Stakeholders recommended expanding Employee Assistance Programs ( E A P ) f o r providers, especially those with lived experiences. Challenges Difficulty acquiring supervision hours due to lack of availability of licensed supervisors within the BHRS able to take on the extra time commitment. High expenses associated with licensure including cost of outside supervision. Lack of consis tent awareness of what County will offer to support licensure. Example Strategies Provide incentives for qualified/licensed staff to provide supervision and/or account for the time burden this has on their workload. Create a database of available licensed supervisors within the BHRS system to support faster linkages with those needin g supervision to prevent loss of unlogged hours toward licensure. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 17 Expand opportunities for financial reimbursement of outside supervisio n costs ( i f needed), trainings and test expe nses (exam cost, testtaking to ols, PTO to study) Offer mentorships with other LCSWs to provide guidance with licensure process; group supervision; didactic training. Offer free law and ethics courses that cover licensure and re quired CE requirements. Staff Training Most providers who responded to the survey viewed staff in thei r clinic/program as having the necessary training to meet the needs of the county's diverse po pulation \"somewhat\" or \"to a great extent.\" Clinical staff generally indicated a desire for more opportunit ies for advanced training and certifications in specific treatment modalities (e.g., EMDR, trauma informed EBPs, DBT) with ongoing consultation/followup to ensure retention and applicat ion. Some participants requested additional opportunities to attend trainings outside of the County. This might include reimbursement for training cost and/ or compensation for time spent in training. Participants noted a need to increase awareness and frequency of Countyprovided/funded training offerings . Input session participants raised a need for greater awareness of mental health among non mental health providers, including teachers, first responders, and police . Participants recommended expanding opportunities for clinical a nd nonclinical staff to attend Countyprovided/funded trainings by increasing frequency of offerings and/or by increasing training accessibility (i.e. remote participation/onlin e trainings). Example strategy : Send newsletters more frequently to behavioral health care work force informing them of online resources, and upcoming training opportunities. Participants recommended providing ongoing followup and training refreshers (in individual and group settings/supervision) and ongoing consultation on training concepts to ensure learnings are successfully applied to practice. Participants recommended expanding evaluation of training outcomes to ensure desired impacts. MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 18 Participants recommended providing more trainings from a lived experience perspective and ensuring a culturally competent a pproach to providing training platforms for selected trainers. Increase breadth of cultural competency training for any/all staff that may engage with clients and community members. Increase mental health and traumainformed trainings for nonmental health providers that may engage with clients and community members, including schoolteac hers, first responders, police, and alcohol and other drug providers. Foundational Knowledge Provider survey respondents indicated \" t r a u m a I n f o r m e d c a r e \" a n d \" c u l t u r a l humility/responsiveness\" most frequently as the top foundational knowledge training pri ority. Trainings for Mental Health Providers Providers viewed traumainformed care an d assessing/treating suicide risk/harm as a t op training priority for staff who have direct contact with client /consumers . Individuals with lived experiences viewed creating a welcoming environment for clients and their families as a top training need for providers . Trainings for Individuals with Lived Experience Individuals with lived experiences viewed traumainformed care training as a top priority for both themselves and their provider. Individuals viewed their own top training needs as managing depression and anxiety a n d self/community advocacy . Stakeholders recommended training peers and family in crisis response and deescalation practices. Trainings for Supervisors Providers viewed creating safety and trust among teams and how to give and receive feedback in a culturally sensitive/responsive way as top training needs for managers and supervisors . Trainings for Administrative Staff Providers viewed engagement and welcoming as a top training need f or administrative staff . MHSA 3year WET Plan, FY 202023 May 2020 | 19 The table below collects and categorizes training areas and top ics that survey and focus group/input session respondents recommended.

These are one -time funds that have been designated and approved through a local community program planning pro cess to meet a similar purpose and set of objectives as the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project . San Mateo County is not submitting a proposal to use INN funds but intends to participate in the broader effort and, thus, is included here and in the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project plan. 2 Section 2: Project Overview Primary Challenge Since the creation of the Mental Health Services Act (MHSA) in 2004, California has made significant strides in improving the lives of those most in need across the state. In particular, Full Service Partnerships (FSP) support people with the most severe and often co -occurring mental health needs. These MHSA -funded FSP programs are d esigned to apply a \"whatever it takes\" approach to serving and partnering with individuals living with severe mental illness. In many counties, FSP programs are effectively improving life outcomes and staff can point to success stories, highlighting dedica ted staff and programs tailored to specific cultural groups and ages. Despite the positive impact of FSP, the program has yet to reach its full potential. Many Californians with serious mental illness still struggle to achieve fuller, more independent live s and achieve the outcomes that MHSA prioritizes (i.e. , reduced criminal justice involvement, incarceration, unnecessary hospitalizations, in -patient stays, and homelessness). Counties and FSP providers have identified two barriers to improving and delive ring on the \"whatever it takes\" promise of FSP : The first is a lack of information about which components of FSP programs deliver the greatest impact. To date, s everal c ounties have strived to establish FSP program s to address specific populations and specific underserved regions, but data collection has been limited or inconsistently implemented. Additionally, there have been few coordinated efforts or comprehensive analys es of this data. This has resulted in an approach t o program deve lopment that is, in its most noble of intent, driven by a desire to serve the community, but based often only on a best guess as to what will be effective. Counties desire a more data -driven approach to program development and continuous improvement, one rooted in shared metrics that paint s a more complete picture of how FSP clients are faring on an ongoing basis, is closely aligned with clients' needs and goals, and allow s comparison across p rograms, providers, and geographies. As one participating county (San Bernardino) described during an early planning meeting for this project, \"Community members, FSP staff, and clinicians have identified an opportunity for data collection [and metrics] to be better integrated with assessment and therapeutic activities .\" These metrics might move beyond the current state -required elements and allow the actionable use of data for more effective learning and ongoing program refinement . Several counties and the ir provider staff , for example , indicate that FSP data is collected for state -mandated compliance and does not inform decision -making or service quality improvements. In addition, data is collected within one system, typically by FSP providers ; however, meaningful FSP outcomes are designed to be measured with cross - agency data (such as health care, criminal justice, etc.), meaning many counties are reliant on self - reported progress toward outcomes rather than verified sources. The second barrier is inconsistent FSP implementation . FSP's \"whatever it takes\" spirit has allowed necessary flexibility to adapt the FSP model for a wide variety of populations and unique local contexts. At the same time, this flexibility inhib its meaningful comparison and a unified standard of care across the state. During early planning conversations for this project, several counties indicated the need to improve how their county collects and uses FSP program data, particularly as it relates to creating 3 consistent and meaningful criteria for eligibility, referral, and graduation. As one participating county (San Bernardino) descri bed, \" consumers have exp ressed interest in a standardized format for eligibility criteria and [seek] consistency in services that are offered and/or provided.\" While some variation to account for local context is to be expected, standardizing these processes using data, evidence, and best practices from across California offers the promise of significant performance improve ments and better client outcomes. To-date, several initiatives have worked on related challenges but have not identified solutions that are directly applicable to this dual -natured problem, or they have not attempted to apply solutions in a statewide context. Specifically: While Los Angeles (LA) County's Department of Mental Health has attempted to address these two primary challenges via their FSP transformation pilot, it remains to be seen whether the metrics, strategies, and data -driven continuous improvement approach is directly applicable to other California counties, or whether their solutions need further customization and refinement in order to be used as a statewide model. Through this Multi -County FSP Innovation Project , counties will also seek to compare and leverage needs and solutions from Los Angeles County, determining how their metrics and processes can be adapted to be relevant to Cal ifornia counties of all geographies and sizes. In 2011 and 2014 , the Mental Health Services Oversight and Accountability Commission (MHSOAC) supported two efforts3 that, at a high level, worked to develop priority indicators of both consumer - and system -level mental health outcomes through l everaging existing data, develop templates and reports that would improve understanding of FSP impact on these outcomes , and identify gaps and redundancies in existing county data collection and system indicators . However, these efforts did not work to implement these changes in a collective, consistent multi -county manner, nor did they focus on additional FSP elements such as eligibility and graduation criteria. This effort also did not focus on creatin g actionable continuous improvement strategies that would improve the quality and consistency of FSP programs. Proposed Project This project responds to the aforementioned challenges by reframing FSP programs around meaningful outcomes and the partner (client) experience. This Multi -County FSP Innovation Project represents an innovative opportunity for a diverse group of participat ing counties (Fresno, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Mateo , Siskiyou, and Ventura ) to develop and implement new data -driven strategies to better coordinate FSP service delivery, operations, data collection, and evaluation. The MHSOAC has supported Third Sector in leading counties through the process of developing and implementing this Multi -County FSP Innovation Project , as well as in facilitating a broader statewide exchange of collective learning and shared opportunities f or improving FSP program s. A San Francisco - based nonprofit, Third Sector has helped behavioral and mental health programs nationwide create an 3 The 2011 effort was undertaken by the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families , and Communities and EMT Associates . The 2014 effort was undertaken by t he UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families , and Communities and Trylon . 4 improved focus on outcomes, guiding government agencies through the process of implementing and sustaining outcom es-oriented, data -driven services focused on improved me aningful life outcomes. Section 4: INN Project Budget and Source of Expenditures below further describes Third Sector's experience and approach to transitioning social services programs to an outcomes orientation. Third Sector will act as the overall project lead and project manager, developing recommendations and customized strategies, leading working group calls and collaborating with each participating county to meaningfully elevate stakeholder voic e, while ensuring the project remains on schedule and adjusting responsively to any challenges. Through participation in this Multi -County FSP Innovation Project , participating counties will implement new data -informed strategies to program design and cont inuous improvement for their FSP programs, supported by county -specific implementation and evaluation technical assistance. Staff will examine what matters in improving individual wellness and recovery and take a data -informed approach to program design, e valuation, and continuous improvement, leading to more effective and responsive FSP programs. The overall purpose and goals of the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project are to: 1. Improve how counties define and track priority outcomes and related performance measures, as well as counties' ability to apply these measures consistently across FSP programs 2. Develop new and/or strengthen existing processes for continuous improvement with the goals of improving outcomes, fostering shared lear ning and accountability, supporting meaningful program comparison, and effectively using qualitative and quantitative data to inform potential FSP program modifications 3. Develop a clear strategy for how outcomes and performance measures can best be tracked and streamlined through various state -level and county -specific reporting tools 4. Develop a shared understanding and more consistent interpretation of the core FSP components across counties, creating a common FSP framework that both reflects service design best practices and is adaptive to local context 5. Increase the clarity and consistency of enrollment criteria, referral, and graduation processes through the development and dissemination of clear tools and guidelines intended for county, providers, and refe rral partners Collaboration with a Statewide FSP Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community : In addition to the county -specific implementation technical assistance ( TA) proposed in this Innovation Project, counties participating in this Innovation Project have co-developed and will participate in a concurrent, statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community that Third Sector is leading with funding from the MHSOAC. County MHSA and FSP staff, FSP providers, FSP clients, and other community stakeholders will eng age in an interactive learning process that includes hearing and sharing lived experiences and developing tools to elevate FSP participant voice. Third Sector will synthesize and disseminate learnings between counties participating in this Innovation Plan and the Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community , helping each group build upon the work of the o ther, and develop a set of recommendations for any state -level changes to FSP requirements and/or data collection practices that are supported by a broad coalition of participating California counties. 5 Rationale for Using the Proposed Approach Over the pa st several months, a broad group of counties (beyond the six counties participating in this Innovation Project) and Third Sector have convened to further unpack these challenges in a collective setting. Specifically, counties and Third Sector have collabor ated in several virtual and in -person convenings to develop (i) an initial baseline understanding of counties' current FSP programs, including unique assets and challenges as it relates to defining and measuring important FSP client outcomes; data collecti on, data sharing, and data use; FSP services and population guidelines; and ongoing FSP performance management and continuous improvement processes, and (ii) an initial, shared plan for implementing outcomes -focused FSP improvements. Counties have expresse d interest in developing a consistent and understandable framework for data collection and reporting across counties that better encourages actionable analysis of outcomes data and helps counties track the adoption of evidence - based practices . The activit ies and goals proposed by this project are directly informed by these efforts and designed to respond to common challenges, capacity needs, and shared opportunities for FSP program improvements cited by counties. This approach is also inspired by Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health's (LACDMH) journey to similarly focus their FSP programs on meaningful outcomes. This Innovation Project will build off LACDMH 's early successes , implement adjusted strategies and approaches that are appropriate for a statewide context , and facilitate broader statewide exchange of collective learning and shared opportunities for improving FSP program s. Number and Description of Population(s) Served This project focuses on transforming the data and processes counties use to manage their FSP programs to improve performance at scale; it does not entail direct services for FSP clients. Accordingly, we have not estimat ed the number of individuals that will be served or identified specific subpopulations of focus. This project will build outcomes -focused approaches across a variety of age -specific and population -specific FSP programs statewide, exploring and identifying key commonalities and relevant differences by population of focus, and building a flexible, scalable set of strategies that can be further implemented statewide . Research on the Innovative Component This Innovation Project presents a new opportunity and innovative practice for participating counties in several ways: 6 1. Systems -Level Changes to Accelerate Performance Instead of piloting a new FSP service or intervention, this project will reduce barriers that prevent counties from leveragin g data and evidence to deliver better outcomes in FSP programs. While piloting and testing new service interventions remains a key tool for driving mental health services innovation, far too often promising innovations are expected to take root in systems that lack the infrastructur e or capacity to support them \u2014leading to suboptimal replication, challenges disseminating learnings, or failure to scale. This Innovation Project seeks to address those structural barriers by accelerating counties' ongoing effort s to use data and shared outcome goals to continuously improve their FSP programs, and do so in a manner that centers on increasing statewide learning. 2. County -Driven Origins with Statewide Impact s This project also represents an opportunity for counti es to drive state progress on reporting requirements, data collection, and data use. Many counties have individually struggled to track FSP client outcomes and make meaningful use of the existing data, but have to -date approached this problem alone. Recogn izing these gaps and the power of a collective effort, counties themselves took the initiative to form this project as a response to their individual FSP program challenges and after hearing reflections on Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health 's FSP transformation. The county -driven origins of this project, paired with support from the MHSOAC, present a unique opportunity for participating counties to both (i) pursue county -specific implementation efforts that will drive lasting improvements withi n their individual FSP programs, and (ii) exchange learnings from these implementation efforts with other counties via a structured Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community designed to help increase statewide consensus on core FSP components and develop shared recommendations for state -level changes to FSP data requirements and guidelines. 3. Introducing New Practices for Encouraging Continuous Improvement and Learning This project proposes to introduce new data -driven practices for managing FSP programs that center on improving clients' experiences and life outcomes and aim to increase consistency in how FSP programs are administered within and across different counties. It aims to develop and pilot continuous improvement processes and actionable data use strategies that are tailored to each participating county's specific context , and to generate new learning and shared consensus around FSP program and performance management best practices, alongside other participating counties. For example, a c ounty may implement a new data dashboard that helps better illustrate client utilization of emergency services over time. This dashboard could be used to understand the relationship between an incoming client's needs, FSP services delivered, and changes in emergency services utilization over time. With this newly clarified data, county staff and/or providers would be able to understand and collaborative ly discuss how different clients' needs should determine the services they receive, based on the historica l success of other, similar clients. 4. Building on Individual County Progress to Create a Statewide Innovative Vision This project will build on the continuous improvement tools and learnings emerging from Third Sector's existing work with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health's (LACDMH) FSP 7 transformation, which centered on understanding and improving core FSP outcomes across all age groups , inclusive of improving stable housing, reducing emergency services utilization, and reducing criminal justice involvement. LACDMH 's FSP transformation efforts have led to the development of new continuous improvement -focused \"Learning Collaboratives\" (regular meetings for providers and LACDMH to review outcomes data and discuss new service approaches), have surfaced new learning s and questions (e.g., how t o define and measure positive FSP life outcomes like \" meaningful use of time\" ), and have better standardize d FSP programs via clarified enrollment and graduation criteria . This project presents an opportunity to deeply explore these learnings and tools at a statewide level in a collaborative manner, bringing counties together to explore and identify which FSP changes and innovations that LACDMH pursued (or purposefully did not pu rsue) might be most relevant and applicable across counties and, importantly, what modifications are necessary to implement these learnings at a state -level . More specifically, counties will explore how these changes may need to be adopted to meet the need s of counties with a variety of different attributes (e.g., smaller counties, more rural counties, counties with fewer program staff, counties with fewer contracted FSP programs, counties with different ethnic and racial makeups), balancing the desire for increased consistency with the spirit of meeting local context and needs. 5. Building Upon Existing Data -Focused Multi -County Collaborations In addition , this project differs from existing, data -focused multi -county Innovation Projects in its focus on implementing and applying data insights to refine current learning and continuous improvement practices within FSP programs . Four California counties are currently participating in an FSP \"classification\" pilot study sponsored by the MHSOA C and in partnership with the Mental Health Data Alliance. Through survey s of specific programs, this \"classification\" pilot seeks to identify specific components of FSP programs that are associated with high -value outcomes, namely early exits . The \"classi fication\" study can create and already has produced valuable learning on how counties can define outcomes like early exit and what FSP program characteristics map to a specified outcome. Moreover, it is an important demonstration of the value of collecting , maintaining, and sharing descriptive information about FSP program profiles that counties can correlate to FSP client outcomes. However, the \"classification\" pilot does not propose to support counties in applying such learnings to their FSP programs, or in creating sustainable data feedback loops that leverage existing data to drive more real-time , continuous program improvements. Additionally, as a pilot, it is limited to the four participating counties and to a select few FSP programs and types (TAY, Adult, and Older Adult) . Counties participating in this Multi -County FSP Innovation Project may look at the entire range of FSP services (including Child) . Finally, this project will regularly connect with a larger group of counties than the scope of the \"classification \" pilot allows, leveraging the statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community that is open to all counties (beyond the six counties contributing funds in this Innovation Project proposal) and that will encourage broader statewide inpu t and collaboration . In 2011, the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families , and Communities and EMT Associates, with support from the MHSOAC , developed templates and reports on statewide and county -specific data that would improve understanding of MHS A's impact, as well as evaluated existing statewide data on FSP 8 impact. While this effort worked to identify current data collection practices and develop data templates, it did not suggest new outcomes domains, data collection, or metrics. Moreover, this effort did not focus on creating actionable continuous improvement strategies that would improve the quality and consistency of FSP programs and services . Similarly, in 2014, the UCLA Center for Healthier Children, Families , and Communities and Trylon , with support from the MHSOAC , reviewed existing data to develop priority indicators of both consumer - and system -level mental health outcomes and understand trends and movement in these indicators over time. This effort also identified gaps and redundancies in existing county data collection and system indicators. However, it did not attempt to implement new and consistent outcomes and metrics across multiple counties, nor did it develop regular continuous improvement processes that would leverage these specific measures in an action -oriented, data -informed manner. This Innovation Project will go beyond both the 2011 and 2014 UCLA -led projects by focusing on both the implementatio n of new data collection and data use strategies , improving consistency and clarity of program guidelines (especially those around cultural or other specific types of services, eligibility, and graduation), and better understanding the connection between F SP services and outcomes. In this manner, this proposed Multi-County FSP Innovation Project proposes a new approach by expanding the extent to which counties attempt to align and create consistency. 5. Proposing Changes to State -level FSP Data Requirements Building from the above, this project also intends to surface specific data collection and data use elements that counties can use to track their FSP outcome goals in a more streamlined, consistent fashion that can be feasibly applied across t he state . Through this project, counties will develop a more cohesive vision around which data elements and metrics are most relevant and recommend changes to statewide FSP data requirements that better prioritize and streamline their use. Ultimately, thes e recommendations will aim to better support counties in understanding who FSP serves, what services it provides , and which outcomes clients ultimately achieve. Stakeholder Input Through individual discussions and group convenings, Third Sector and partic ipating counties have discussed several strategies to ensure that the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project aligns with each county's goals, including priorities expressed in stakeholder forums. The Appendix includes more detail about each county's specific stakeholder needs, how this project addresses these needs, and how community planning processes in each county have impacted the overall project vision. To date, Third Sector has supported counties in sharing the project with local stakeholders by providi ng summary materials (i.e. project descriptions and talking points) and answers to frequently asked questions. These materials were requested by counties and designed to be accessible to a broad audience. Counties such as Sacramento and San Bernardino have already used and adapted these for community planning meetings , soliciting feedback that has helped to inform this plan . Currently, all participating counties have shared this project as a part of their three -year plan, annual update, or standalone proposal for public comment and county Board of Supervisors' review. 9 Furthermore, this project intends to engage county stakeholders \u2014including program participants, frontline staff, and other key community partners \u2014throughout its duration. In t he implementation stage, engagement activities may include consulting and soliciting feedback from stakeholders when defining the outcome goals, metrics, service components, and referral and graduation criteria. Counties may choose to do this through focus groups, interviews, and working group discussions. Counties may also invite participants or community representatives to participate in statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community events . Since the community planning process is ongoing, stakeholders will continue to receive updates and provide input in future county meetings that are open to the public. Additional description of these activities can be found in the Work Plan and Timeline section below. Learning Goals and Project Aims This project exp ects to contribute new learnings and capacities for participating counties throughout the county -specific TA and evaluation activities involved. Specifically, this project will seek to assess two types of impacts: (A) the overall impact and influence of th e project activities and intended changes to current FSP practices and program administration (\"systems -level impacts\"), and (B) the overall improvements for FSP client outcomes (\"client -level impacts\"). These two types of measures will help determine whet her the practices developed by this project simplify and improve the usefulness of data collection and management and cross -county collaboration , and whether these practices support the project's ultimate goal of improving FSP client outcomes. Guiding evaluation questions that this project aims to explore include, but are not limited to, the following , as divided by each type of impact: A) Systems -Level Impacts Systems -level impacts will be assessed both within each county to understand local administration changes, as well as across counties to assess the impact of the multi -county, collaborative approach. Guiding evaluation questions to understand changes to ind ividual county FSP administration are: 1. What was the process that each participating county and Third Sector took to identify and refine FSP program practices? 2. What changes to counties' original FSP program practices were made and piloted? 3. Compared to curre nt FSP program practices, do practices developed by this project streamline, simplify, and/or improve the overall usefulness of data collection and reporting for FSP programs? 4. Has this project improved how data is shared and used to inform discussions within each county on FSP program performance and strategies for continuous improvement? 5. How have staff learnings through participation in this FSP -focused project led to shared learning across other programs and services within each participating county? Beyond the above county -level learning goals, the project also aims to understand the value of a collaborative, multi -county approach via understanding the level of county collaboration, the quality of it, and its ultimate impact. Guiding evaluation question s to assess the collaborative nature of this project include, but are not limited to: 6. What was the process that participating counties and Third Sector took to create and sustain a collaborative, multi -county approach? 10 7. What concrete, transferrable learnings, tools, and/or recommendations for state -level change have resulted from the Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community and collective group of participating counties ? 8. Which types of collaboration forums and topics have yielded the greatest value for county participants? B) Client -Level Impacts 9. What impacts has this project and related changes created for clients' outcomes and clients' experiences in FSP? Evaluation and Learning Plan This project will include two types of learning and evaluation. First, Third Sector and the counties will pursue a number of evaluation and data analysis activities throughout the duration of the project (as described in the Work Plan and Timeline section below) to better understand and measur e current FSP outcomes and identify appropriate strategies for improving these outcomes. Second, Third Sector and the California Mental Health Services Authority (\"CalMHSA\") will support counties in identifying, procuring, and establishing an ongoing gove rnance structure for partnering This third -party evaluator (\"evaluator\") will provide an independent assessment of the project's impacts and meaningfully assess the above learning goals via an evaluation. These efforts will su pport counties in articulating a meaningful, data -informed impact story to share across the state about the specific actions pursued through this project and the resulting learnings. Counties have expressed a desire to prioritize onboarding this evaluator in the early stages of the project. The counties have emphasized the importance of having this partner involved in any initial efforts to approximate counties' baseline FSP practices and performance, as well as provide appropriate time to execute any data -sharing agreements required for the evaluator to gather and assess outcomes data across each of the participating counties. Currently, counties have identified RAND Corporation as a potential evaluation partner, given that RAND has previously partner ed with counties through CalMHSA and brings previous experience evaluating FSP programs in LA County . Participating counties , Third Sector ,4 and CalMHSA are currently taking steps to contract and onboard this evaluation partner . A description and e xample measures for each of the nine evaluation questions follows below. Counties, with support from Third Sector and the evaluator , will develop and finalize these measures after contracting with the evaluator. The evaluation plan will include a timeline for defined deliverables and will crystallize these evaluation questions, outcome measures, data -sharing requirements and resulting evaluation activities. Evaluation planning activities will also include developi ng and confirming a strategy 4 Third Sector will support counties in identifying and onboarding an evaluation partner, developing an ongoing governance structure for collaborating with the evaluator, and finalizing outcome measures and required data collectio n strategies through Third Sector's TA period (i.e., through November 2021). Third Sector does not plan to have an ongoing role in the Evaluation period (December 2021 through June 2024). 11 for each county to gather and collect data consistently, both for the purposes of creating a baseline understanding of current FSP program practices and performance, as well as for gathering data required for the evaluation. The table below proposes potential qualitative and quantitative measures to assess both systems -level and client -level impacts. As described above, these system -level impacts will assess the positive value and changes experienced by participating cou nties an d community stakeholders. These systems -level measures will be tracked during and following the initial 23 -month implementation TA period , and directly answer guiding evaluation questions 1-8 above. Additionally, this project proposes to measure overall improvements in FSP client outcomes that may occur during the project timeframe (client -level impacts), to better understand evaluation question 9 above. Example Measures Example Data Source Relevant Evaluation Questions Systems -Level Impacts Policy changes that a county, the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS), or the MHSOAC implemented as a result of the project Qualitative interviews of participating counties, state agencies 2, 5, 7 New FSP service approach as a result of the project Qualitativequalitative interviews of participating counties, observational data from local FSP programs 2, 4, 5 , 7 New data sharing mechanisms and/or agreements created to support ongoing evaluation, feedback, and analysis of disparities Qualitativequalitative interviews of participating counties 3, 4, 7 Improvements or changes to FSP continuous improvement practices Qualitative interviews of participating counties 2, 3, 4, 5 , 7 New FSP metrics or data elements measured in each county Qualitative interviews of participating counties 2, 3, 4, 5 , 7 FSP metrics or data elements removed by each county due to lack of relevance or usefulness Qualitative interviews of participating counties 2, 3, 4, 5 , 7 12 Example Measures Example Data Source Relevant Evaluation Questions Overall staff and clinician satisfaction with quality and impact of outcome measures selected, changes to data collection practices and service guidelines Survey and/or qualitative interviews of participating counties 2, 3, 4 , 8 Increased confidence from staff and clinicians that measures tracked are meaningful for participants and/or are regularly reviewed and used to inform programs Survey and/or qualitative interviews of participating counties 3, 4, 8 Increased understanding across providers and/or county staff of how priority outcome s are defined and the corresponding data collection and reporting requirements Survey and/or qualitative interviews of participating counties and local staff 3, 4, 8 Client - and Program Level Impacts Changes in cross -system outcomes, such as: Increased percentage of housing -insecure FSP clients connected with housing supports Self-report via existing outcomes collections systems; data from local housing agencies 9 Decreased recidivism for justice -involved FSP clients Self-report via existing outcomes collections systems; data from local jails, and state prisons 9 Decreased use of emergency psychiatric facilities Self-report via existing outcomes collections systems; billing records from local hospitals via the county Mental Health Plan 9 Increased percentage of clients engaging in recreational activities, employment, and/or other forms of meaningful use of time Self-report via existing outcomes collections systems; additional 9 13 Example Measures Example Data Source Relevant Evaluation Questions new state and local data sharing agreements targeting tax and employment data Increased percentage of clients graduating FSP successfully Enrollment and retention data from county FSP providers 9 Increased program graduation rates for clients due to increased capacity (i.e., exits because clients are stable and re -integrated into the community) Enrollment and retention data from county FSP providers 9 Additional client -level outcomes, such as: Reduced FSP outcome disparities (i.e. disparities by race , ethnicity , and language) Comparison of pre - and post -outcomes on existing outcomes collections systems 9 Timely access to programs and services aligned with individuals' long -term goals FSP provider services and billing records 9 Decreased utilization of crisis services in counties (e.g., emergency rooms, mental health, justice) due to increased emphasis on prevention and wellbeing Data from county hospitals, jails, FSP providers 9 Note that the time period for observing and evaluating changes in outcomes and metrics may end sooner (e.g., end of 2023), so as to provide sufficient time for the evaluator to measure and synthesize evaluation findings and to share this information with c ounties. Third Sector, the evaluator, and participating counties will determine the exact measures and an appropriate evaluation methodology for assessing client -level impacts during the project. Participating counties will identify and finalize these meas ures , data sources, and associated learning goals during the first year of the project , memorialized in a shared evaluation plan, with advisory support from Third Sector and the evaluator. As mentioned above, it will be beneficial to the overall project and the project's evaluation plan to identify and partner with an evaluator prior to fin alizing the specific learning metrics, given the complex and systems -level nature of these changes. While the 14 measures listed above are preliminary ideas and priorities identified by participating counties, Third Sector, the evaluator, and the counties wil l work to refine these measures in the first year of this project. The evaluation plan will include a timeline for defined deliverables and will crystallize these evaluation questions, outcome measures, data -sharing requirements and resulting evaluation a ctivities. Third Sector, participating counties, and the evaluat or will also carefully consider and discuss strategies for mitigating possible unintended consequences when designing the evaluation and selecting measures to be tracked (e.g., any perverse in centives to graduate clients from FSP before they are ready). During the first year of the project, t he evaluator and Third Sector will also support counties in identifying the appropriate method and steps to develop an accurate baseline of these measures . See the Budget Narrative section below for additional detail on the evaluation activities. 15 Section 3: Additional Information for Regulatory Requirements Contracting Participating counties intend to contract with a technical assistance provider to support counties with project implementation activities. As described above in the Proposed Project section, the MHSOAC has supported Third Sector (a San Francisco -based nonp rofit) in leading counties through the process of developing and implementing this Innovation Project, as well as in facilitating a broader statewide exchange of collective learning and shared opportunities for improving FSP program s. Third Sector will act as the overall project lead and project manager, developing recommendations and customized strategies, leading working group calls and collaborating with each county to meaningfully elevate stakeholder voice, while ensuring the project remains on schedule and respon ding to any challenges. Participating counties will also identify and contract with an evaluation p artner during the first year of the project. The evaluation partner will support counties in designing and implementing a shared strategy for assessing the project impact. Counties plan to contract with Third Sector and the evaluation partner through the existing Joint Powers Agreement (JPA) via CalMHSA . The JPA sets forward specific governance standards to guide county relationships with one an other , Third Sector , and the evaluator and ensure appropriate regulatory compliance . CalMHSA will also develop participation agreements with each participating county that will further memorialize these standards and CalMHSA's specific role and responsibil ities in providing fiscal and contract management support to the counties. As further detailed in Section 4 , counties intend to use a portion of the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project budget to pay CalMHSA for this support . Community Program Planning The Appendix to the Innovation Plan includes more detail about each participating county's specific stakeholder needs, how this project addresses these needs, and what the overall community planning process has involved in each county. Since the community planning process is ongoing, stakeholders will continue to receive updates and provide input throughout the duration of this project, including participation via specific focus group and stakeholder interview activities outlined in the project work plan. Alignment with Mental Health Services Act General Standards This project meets MHSA General Standards in the following ways: It is a multi -county collaboration between Fresno, Ventura, Sacramento, Siskiyou, San Bernardino, and San Mateo to address FSP progr am challenges and opportunities It is client -driven , as it seeks to reframe FSP programs around meaningful outcomes for the individual, centering on holistic client wellness and recovery It seeks to create a coordinated approach to program design and servi ce delivery, leading to an integrated service experience for clients and family 16 It will establish a shared understanding of the core components of FSP programs and create a common framework that reflects best practices while adapting for local context and cultural competency Diverse stakeholders will be meaningfully engaged throughout the development and implementation of the project Cultural Competence and Stakeholder Involvement in Evaluation This project intends to engage each county's stakeh olders (i.e. , program participants, frontline staff, other key community partners) throughout its duration, including in evaluation activities. Example engagement activities may include, but are not limited to: Asking for input from FSP provider staff, cli ents or client representatives, partner agencies, and other stakeholders (via focus groups, interviews, surveys, and/or working group discussions) as counties identify and define outcome goals, develop meaningful metrics for tracking these goals over time, identify key FSP service components, and surface opportunities to clarify and streamline referral and graduation criteria Sharing and reviewing data gathered and analyzed throughout this project \u2014including in the Evaluation period \u2014with community members to gather additional input and insight in interpreting trends Inviting clients and/or client representatives to pa rticipate in s tatewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community events Soliciting qualitative feedback from stakeholders on how this pro ject has helped (or hindered) FSP service delivery in each county and opportunities for further improvement Sharing learnings and regular updates from this project with stakeholders at MHSA community planning meetings and county -specific stakeholder commit tees Innovation Project Sustainability and Continuity of Care This Innovation Project does not propose to provide direct services to FSP clients. Each contractor (Third Sector; the third -party evaluator; CalMHSA) will operate in an advisory or administrative capacity and will not provide services to FSP clients. Throughout project implementation, participating counties will ensure continuity of FSP services , without disruption as result of this project. Participating counties are strongly interested in sustaining any learnings, practices, and/or new statewide collaborative structures developed through this Innovation Project that demonstrate effecti veness in meeting the project goals. The Multi -County FSP Innovation Project work plan includes dedicated time and resources for sustainability planning among counties and Third Sector throughout each phase of the project . During the first two phases of th e Implementation TA period (Landscape Assessment and Implementation) , Third Sector will work closely with each participating county to ensure sustainability and transition considerations are identified and prioritized in developing new strategies for implementation, and that, by the conclusion of the project, county staff have the capacity to continue any such new strategies and pract ices piloted through this project . In addition, the final two months of the Implementation TA period provide additional time and dedicated focus for sustainability planning, whereby Third Sector will work with participating counties to 17 understand the succe ss of the changes to -date and finalize strategies to sustain and build on these new data -driven approaches . Participating counties may also partner with other counties to elevate project implementation successes in order to champion broad understanding, su pport, and continued resources for outcomes -focused, data -driven mental health and social services. These plans are further described below in the Work Plan and Timeline section). Counties will also use findings from the evaluation to identify which specific practices or changes were most effective for achieving the different client - and systems -level impacts that the project will measure, prioritizing these for continuation in future years. Similarly, while Third Sector will organize and facilitate the statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community in 2020, the counties and Third Sector intend for the Learning Community to be largely county -driven and county -led. The counties and Third Sector will gather feedback on the efficacy of the Learning Com munity at various points throughout the first year of the project (2020) and will develop a plan for continuing prioritized activities in an ongoing fashion, whether through county -led facilitation, ongoing Third Sector support, and/or another strategy. Th e counties and Third Sector welcome and hope to solicit the MHSOAC's input in these conversations. Data Use and Protection Third Sector does not intend to request, collect, or hold client -level Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and/or Protected Health Information (PHI) during this Innovation Project. Participating counties may only provide Third Sector with de -identified and/or aggregate data related to their FSP programs. Any such de-identified and/or aggregate data provided will be stored electronically within secure file - sharing systems and made available only to employees with a valid need to access. Should the third -party evaluator require access to individual level data and /or PII/PHI, CalMHSA, the evaluator and counties will take steps to ensure appropriate data protections are put in place and necessary data use agreements are established . Communication and Dissemination Plan Throughout the ide ation and development of this Innovation Project, Third Sector has maintained ongoing conversation with the MHSOAC to share updates on county convenings, submit contract deliverables, solicit feedback about project decisions, discuss areas of further colla boration, and generally ensure alignment of interests, goals, and expectations. As the project progresses and moves into a phase of county -specific landscaping and implementation TA, Third Sector will continue to share regular updates, questions, and deliv erables with Commission staff. These updates may include summaries of common challenges that participating counties experience on their FSP programs, from state -level data collection and reporting to performance management and continuous improvement practi ces. Based on these common challenges, participating counties intend to develop a set of shared recommendations for changes to state -level data requirements. Through the statewide Outcomes - Driven FSP Learning Community , these recommendations will be co-created and informed by counties across the state. Third Sector will share regular updates on Learning Community workshops and may invite Commission staff to attend select events. Additionally, Third Sector and the counties will collaborate with the MHS OAC to determine if and when presentations to the Commission may be valuable for further disseminating project learnings. 18 As the implementation phase of work comes to a close, Third Sector will work with participating counties to develop a plan for sustai ning new outcomes -focused, data -driven strategies. This will include developing a communication plan for sharing project activities, accomplishments, and takeaways with the MHSOAC and DHCS. Third Sector will share counties' recommended revisions to state d ata requirements, and it will initiate discussions about opportunities for the MHSOAC and DHCS to streamline and clarify guidelines and requirements, supporting more effective and responsive FSP programs. Third Sector will also share insights about the pro cess itself, from Innovation Plan development to implementation TA, and reflect on the successes and challenges of these efforts, promoting a discussion about the sustainability and scalability of future Innovation Projects. Work Plan and Timeline Project Activities and Deliverables and Timeline The Multi -County FSP Innovation Project will begin in January 2020 and end in June 2024 for a total project duration of 4.5 years. The project will be divided into two periods: an Implementation TA period and an Evaluation period. Throughout project implementation, counties will ensure continuity of FSP services. In the first 23 -month Implementation TA period, Third Sector will work directly with each participating county to understand each county's local FSP context and provide targeted, county -specific assistance in implementing outcomes -focused improvements. Third Sector will leverage a combination of regular (weekly to biweekly) virtual meetings or calls with counties' core project staff, regular site visit s and in - person working groups, and in -person stakeholder meetings, in order to advance the project objectives. These efforts will build on learnings and tools developed in Third Sector's work with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health, as wel l as Third Sector's previous partnerships with other California and national behavioral health, human services, justice, and housing agencies. Each county will receive dedicated technical support with a combination of activities and deliverables tailored f or their unique county context, while also having access to shared resources and tools applicable across all FSP programs and counties. This Implementation TA period will be divided into three discrete phases (Landscape Assessment; Implementation; Sustaina bility Planning). The activities and deliverables outlined below are illustrative, as exact phase dates, content, and sequencing of deliverables will depend on each county's needs and goals. County staff and Third Sector will collaborate over the next seve ral months to identify each county's most priority activities and goals and to create a unique scope o f work to meet these needs. See Figure 1 below for an illustrative Implementation TA work plan and timeline by phase. In the second period of the project, participating counties will pursue a n evaluation, conducted by a third -party evaluator, with the goal of assessing the impacts and learning that this project produces.5 5 Note that this evaluator will also be a part of the Implementation TA period, given the importance of having this partner involved in any initial efforts to approximate counties' baseline FSP practices and performance, as well as to provide appropriate time to execute any data use agreements required for the evaluator to gather and assess outcomes data across each of the participating counties. Additional details on the timeline and plan for onboarding an evaluation partner follow in the sections below. 19 This Evaluation Period and the overall Multi -County FSP Innovation Project will conclude at the end of June 2024. 20 Figure 1 : Illustrative Implementation TA Work Plan Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec2022 Evaluation2021 2020 SUSTAINABILITY PLANNINGIMPLEMENTATION LANDSCAPE ASSESSMENT Assess FSP service mix, populations, graduation criteria, and outcomes performance Map existing business processes and continuous improvement approachesDevelop priority outcomes and metrics; compare to existing data sources and collection strategies Build an understanding of community context through stakeholder engagement Develop post -implementation evaluation plan Project and Assess Phase Kickoff Outcomes and Metrics Plan Population Criteria Outline Continuous Improvement Plan Evaluation Qualifications Evaluation Procurement PlanPilot new data collection and reporting strategiesDevelop new population, service, and graduation criteria Pilot continuous improvement approaches Plan evaluation approach in concert with selected evaluator Implementation Phase Kickoff Population and Services Guide Updated Data Collection and Reporting Guidelines Continuous Improvement Implementation Evaluation Milestones and PlanCollective advocacy Evaluation plan and governance Continuity Plan Communications Plan Updated Evaluation Plan and GovernanceLocal sustainability planningPOTENTIAL ACTIVITIES POTENTIAL DELIVERABLES PHASEPotential Site Visits / In -Person Working Group Mtgs / Steering Committee Mtgs 21 Phase 1: Landscape Assessment The Landscape Assessment phase will act as a ramp -up period and an opportunity for Third Sector to learn about each county's context in further detail, including local community assets, resources, and opportunities, existing FSP program practices, and performance on existing outcomes measures. Building off of templates fr om national mental and behavioral health projects, Third Sector will customize deliverables and activities for each county's local FSP context. During this phase, Third Sector will work with county staff to lead working groups and interviews, analyze count y data, and facilitate meetings with local stakeholders to identify opportunities for improvement. County staff will share data and documents with Third Sector and provide guidance on local priorities and past experiences. Other example activities may incl ude conducting logic models and root cause analyses to create consensus around desired FSP outcomes, reviewing current outcomes and performance data to understand trends, and gathering qualitative data about the client journey and staff challenges. By the end of this phase, each participating county will have an understanding of the current state of its FSP programs, customized recommendations to create a more data -driven, outcomes -oriented FSP program, and a realistic work plan for piloting new improvement s during the Implementation phase. Third Sector will produce a selection of the following illustrative deliverables, as appropriate for each county's unique context and needs: Outcomes and Metrics Plan: Recommended improved FSP outcomes and metrics to understand model fidelity and client success, including recommended areas of commonality, alignment, and consistency across counties Population to Program Map: A map of current FSP sub -populations, FSP programs, and community need, to illuminate any potent ial gaps or opportunities Population Criteria Outline: Recommended changes to population eligibility criteria, service requirements, and graduation criteria Current State to Opportunity Map : A map of metrics and existing data sources, including identificat ion of any gaps and opportunities for improved linkages and continuity (e.g., auto - population of fields, removal of duplicate metrics, linking services or billing data to understand trends, opportunities to use additional administrative data sources to val idate self -reported data) Outcomes Performance Assessment : An assessment of provider and clinic performance against preliminary performance targets, leveraging existing data and metrics Process Map : A process map identifying current continuous improvement and data -sharing processes and opportunities for improvement Implementation Plan: An implementation plan for new continuous improvement processes, both internal (i.e., creating improved feedback loops and coordination between county data, funding, and clin ical or program teams) and external (i.e., creating improved feedback loops between county teams and contracted providers) During this phase, Third Sector and the counties will develop a set of qualifications and work plan for procuring a third -party evalu ator. Example evaluator -led deliverables include: Recommended evaluation methodology (e.g., randomized control trial, quasi -experimental method, etc.) Work plan for executing any required data -use agreements and/or Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals that may be necessary to implement the evaluation Evaluation plan that identifies specific outcomes, metrics, data sources and timeline for measuring client - and systems -level impacts Final impact report Counties will select an evaluator based upon the qualifications and work plan described above . Following procurement and/or onboarding as appropriate , Third Sector, counties, and the evaluator will develop a scope of work detailing the exact deliverables and activities that the e valuator will lead as part of the evaluation , and any associated planning and preparing (e.g. validation of baseline FSP practices and performance) that should occur during the Implementation phase. Phase 2: Implementation Third Sector will provide individualized guidance and support to each county through the Phase 2 Implementation process, piloting new strategies that were developed during Phase 1. Understanding limitations on staff capacity, Third Sector will support county staff by preparing mate rials, analyzing and benchmarking performance data, helping execute on data -sharing agreements, and leading working group or project governance meetings. County staff will assist with local and internal coordination in order to meet project milestones. Add itional activities in Phase 2 may include the following: improving coordination across county agencies to create a human -centered approach to client handoffs and transfers, completing data feedback loops, and developing new referral approaches for equitabl e access across client FSP populations. As a result of this phase, county staff will have piloted and begun implementing new outcomes -oriented, data -driven strategies. With Third Sector's implementation support, participating counties may achieve a selecti on of the following deliverables in Phase 2: Referral Strategies : Piloted strategies to improve coordination with referral partners and the flow of clients through the system Population and Services Guide : New and/or revised population guidelines, service requirements, and graduation criteria Updated Data Collection and Reporting Guidelines : Streamlined data reporting and submission requirements Data Dashboards: User -friendly data dashboards displaying performance against priority FSP metrics Continuous Improvement Process Implementation: Piloted continuous improvement and business processes to create clear data feedback loops to improve services and outcomes Staff Training: Staff trained on continuous improvement best practices FSP Frame work: Synthesized learnings and recommendations for the FSP framework that counties and Third Sector can share with the broader statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community for further refinement 23 FSP Outcomes and Metrics Advocacy Packet: Recommendation s on improved FSP outcomes, metrics, and data collection and sharing practices for use in conversations and advocacy in stakeholder forums and with policy makers. Phase 3: Sustainability Planning Throughout Phases 1 and 2, Third Sector will work closely w ith each participating to ensure sustainability and transition considerations are identified and prioritized during implementation, and that, by the conclusion of the project, county staff have the capacity to continue any new strategies and practices piloted through this project. Phase 3 will provide additional time and dedicated focus for sustainability planning, whereby Third Sector will work with participating counties to understa nd the success of the changes to -date and finalize strategies to sustain and build on these new data -driven approaches . Participating counties may also partner with other counties to elevate project implementation successes in order to champion broad under standing, support, and continued resources for outcomes -focused, data -driven mental health and social services. Specific Phase 3 activities may include articulating lessons learned, applying lessons learned to other mental health and social service efforts , creating ongoing county work plans, and developing an FSP impact story. As a result of Phase 3, each participating county will have a clear path forward to continue building on the accomplishments of the project. Third Sector will produce a selection of the following deliverables for each county: Project Case Study: A project case study highlighting the specific implementation approach, concrete changes, and lessons learned Continuity Plan : A continuity plan that identifies specific activities, timelines and resources required to continue to implement additional outcomes -oriented, data -driven approaches Project Toolkit: A project toolkit articulating the specific approaches and strategies that were successful in the local FSP transformation for use in sim ilarly shifting other mental health and related services to an outcomes orientation Communications Plan: A communications strategy articulating communications activities, timelines, and messaging Project Takeaways : Summary documents articulating major take aways for educating statewide stakeholders on the value of the new approach Evaluation Work Plan and Governance: An evaluation work plan to assist the counties and the evaluation partner in project managing the Evaluation period Expected Outcomes At the end of this project, each participating county will have clearly defined FSP outcome goals that relate to program and beneficiary priorities, well -defined performance measures to track progress towards these outcome goals, and a clarified strategy for tracking and sharing outcomes data to support meaningful comparison, learning, and evaluation. The specific implementa tion activities may vary based on the results of each county's landscape assessment, but may include the following: piloting new referral processes, updating service guidelines and graduation criteria, using qualitative and quantitative data to identify pr ogram gaps, sharing data across providers, agencies, and counties, streamlining data 24 practices, improving data -reporting formats, implementing data -driven continuous improvement processes, and recommending changes to state -level data requirements. Section 4: INN Project Budget and Source of Expenditures Overview of Project Budget and Sources of Expenditures: All Counties The total proposed budget supporting six counties in pursuing this Innovation Project is approximately $4.85M over 4.5 -years. This includes project expenditures for four different primary purposes: Third Sector implementation TA ($ 2.87 M), fiscal and contract management through CalMHSA ($.314M) , third- party evaluation ($ 0.596M), as well as additional expenditures for county -specific needs (\"County - Specific Costs\") ($ 1.07M). All costs will be funded using county MHSA Innovation funds, with the exception of San Mateo County which will contribute available one -time CSS funding. Counties will contribute varying levels of funding towards a collective pool of resources that will support the project expenditures (excluding County - Specific Costs , which counties will manage and administer directly). This pooled funding approac h will streamline counties' funding contributions and drawdowns, reduce individual project overhead, and increase coordination across counties in the use of these funds. See Figure 2 below for the estimated total sources and uses of the project budget over the 4.5 -year project duration across all six participating counties. The Appendix includes additional detail on each county's specific contributions and planned expenditures. Budget Narrative for Shared Project Costs Consultant Costs and Contracts: Each c ounty is contributing funding to a shared pool of resources that will support the different contractor and consultant costs associated with the project. These costs include support from Third Sector (implementation TA), CalMHSA (fiscal and contract managem ent), and the third -party evaluator (evaluation). These consultants and contractors will operate across the group of participating counties, in addition to supporting each individual county with its own unique support needs. The total amount of consultant and contractor costs is approximately $3.78 M across all six counties over the 4.5 year timeline. A description of each of these three cost categories follows below . Third Sector Costs As described in the Project Activities and Deliverables section above, Third Sector will lead counties through individualized implementation TA over a 23 -month timeframe (January 2020 through November 2021). The total budget f or Third Sector's TA across all six counties is $ 2.87 M over the ful l 23- month TA peri od. These costs will fund Third Sector teams who will provide a wide range of dedicated technical assistance services and subject matter experience to each individual county, as they pursue the goals of this Innovation Plan. Third Sector staff will leverag e regular site visits to each county, in addition to leading weekly to biweekly virtual meetings with different working groups, developing recommendations for the project Steering Committee, and supporting county staff throughout each of the three implemen tation TA phases. 25 Based in San Francisco and Boston, Third Sector is one of the leading implementers of outcomes - oriented strategies in America. Third Sector has supported over 20 communities to redirect over $800M in public funds to data -informed, outcome s-oriented services and programs. Third Sector's experience includes working with the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health to align over $350M in annual MHSA FSP and PEI funding and services with the achievement of meaningful life outcomes for well over 25,000 Angelenos; transforming $81M in recurring mental health services in King County, WA to include new performance reporting and continuous improvement processes that enable the county and providers to better track each providers' monthly performance relative to others and against specific, county -wide performance goals ; and advising the County of Santa Clara in the development of a six-year, $32M outcomes -oriented contract intended to support individuals with serious mental illnes s and complex needs through the provision of community -based behavioral health services. CalMHSA Costs Six counties (San Mateo, Sacramento, San Berna rdino, Ventura, Sisk iyou, and Fresno) have selected to contract using the existing Joint Powers Agreement ( JPA) via CalMHSA. CalMHSA will act as the fiscal and contract manager for this shared pool of resources through the existing JPA. The JPA sets forward specific governance standards to guide county relationships with one another , Third Sector , and the evalu ator. CalMHSA will develop participation agreements with each participating county that will further memorialize these standards and CalMHSA's specific role and responsibilities in providing fiscal and contract management support to the counties. CalMHSA charges an estimated 9% for its services. Rates are based on the specific activities and responsibilities CalMHSA assumes . The total estimated cost of CalMHSA's services across all six counties, assum ing a 9% rat e, are $.31 4M over the total duration of the project . Evaluation Costs Third Sector and the counties will determine the appropriate procurement approach and qualifications for a third -party evaluator during the first nine months of the project. Counties have expressed a desire to prio ritize onboarding an evaluator in the early stages of the project. Currently, counties have identified RAND Corporation as a potential evaluation partner, as RAND has previously partnered with counties through CalMHSA and brings previous experience evaluat ing FSP programs in Los Angeles County . Once selected, counties intend to contract with the evaluator via the JPA administered through CalMHSA. Third Sector and CalMHSA will support counties in determining the appropriate statement of work, budget, and fun ding plan for the third -party evaluator. The current budget projects a total evaluation cost of approximately $.596M. The evaluator will be responsible for developing a formal evaluation plan, conducting evaluation activities, and producing an evaluation report. Estimated costs assume that the counties, Third Sector, and the to -be-determined third -party evaluator will collaborate to develop a uniform evaluation approach and set of performance metrics, with corresponding metric definitions that c an be applied consistently across all counties. Costs are estimates and subject to change. Additional charges, such as academic overhead rates and/or the costs for completing any required data sharing agreements, may apply. If any additional information 26 emerges that will increase costs beyond the initially budgeted amounts, the counties , CalMHSA and Third Sector will work in partnership with the MHS OAC to identify appropriate additional funding. Budget Narrative for County -Specific Costs The remaining project costs are intended to support additional, county -specific expenditures. Counties will fund these costs directly, rather than thr ough a pooled funding approach. A summary of the total $1.07M in County -Specific Costs across all six counties follows below. The Appendix includes additional detail of each county's specific expenditures within these categories: Personnel Costs Total personnel costs (county staff salaries , benefits) for all counties are approximately $844,000 over 4.5 years and across six counties. Each county's appendix, attached, details the specific personnel that this will support. Operating Costs Total operating costs for counties are approximately $ 233,000 over 4.5 years and across six counties. Operating costs support anticipated travel costs for each county and requisite county -specific administrative costs. Each county's appendix, attached, details their specific operating costs. Non -Recurring Cos ts This project will not require any technology, equipment, or other forms of non -recurring costs. 27 FIGURE 2: BUDGET BY FUNDING SOURCE AND FISCAL YEAR EXPENDITURES Personnel $365,998 $4,859,269 28 BUDGET CONTEXT - EXPENDITURES BY FUNDING SOURCE AND FISCAL YEAR (FY) ADMINISTRATION: A.

Sacramento Cou nty 2. San Bernardino County 3. Siskiyou County 4. Ventura County The other two participating counties, Fresno County and San Mateo County, are not included in this appendix for the following reasons: 5. Fresno County has already submitted an Innovation Project plan t o the MHSOAC detailing its plans to participate in this project. This plan was approved by the MHSOAC. 6. San Mateo County does not have MHSA INN funds available to commit to this project, but instead intends to use unspent MHSA CSS funds to participate in th e goals and activities of this project, alongside other counties. These are one -time funds that have been designated and approved through a local community program planning process to meet a similar purpose and set of objectives as the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project . San Mateo County is not submitting a proposal to use INN funds but is participating in the broader effort and thus is included here. Budget summaries for both Fresno and San Mateo, however, are included for additional r eference regarding the total budget across all counties. Each county appendix describes the county -specific local need for this Multi-County FSP Innovation Project. Though there are slight differences among participating counties' in terms of highest priority and/or specificity of local need, the response to this local need will be similar among counties through the execution of the Innovation Plan . Through this Innovation Project proposal , participating counties seek to engage in a statewide initiative seeking to increase counties' collective capacity to gather and use data to better design, implement, and manage FSP services. The key priorities outlined in the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project plan (i.e., improve how counties define and track priority outcomes, develop processes for continuous improvement, develop a clear strategy for tracking outcomes and performance measures, updating and disseminating clear FSP service guidelines, imp roving enrollment and referral process implementation consistency) will allow each participating county to address current challenges and center FSP programs and services around meaningful outcomes for participants. More specifically, participating in this project and aligning with the identified priorities will enable participating counties to: 31 Develop a clear strategy for how outcome goals and performance metrics can best be tracked using existing state and/or county -required tools to support meaningful comparison, learning, and evaluation Explore how appropriate goals and metrics may vary based on population (e.g., age, acuity, etc.) Update and disseminate clear FSP service guidelines using a common FSP framework that reflects clinical best practices Create or strengthen mechanisms for sharing best practices and fostering cross -provider learning Improve existing FSP performance management practices (i.e., when and how often program data and progress towards goals is discussed, what data is included and in what format, how next steps and program modifications are identified) This project will also provide participating counties the opportunity to share and exchange knowledge with other counties through the statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learni ng Community . This learning will not only contribute to improved participant outcomes and program efficiency, but may also help facilitate statewide changes to data requirements. In addition to outlining county -specific local need and community planning p rocesses, each county appendix outline s a budget narrative and county budget request by fiscal year, with detail on specific budget categories. 32 Appendix: Sacramento County County Contact and Specific Dates Primary County Contact: Julie Leung; leungj@saccounty.net ; (916) 875 -4044 Date Proposal was posted for 30 -day Public Review: November 18, 2019 Date of Local Mental Health Board hearing: December 18, 2019 Date of Board of Supervisors (BOS) approval: January 14, 2020 Description of the Local Need Sacramento County has eight (8) FSP programs serving over 2,100 individuals annually. Each FSP serves a specific age range or focuses on a specific life domain. While a majority of the FSP program s serve transition -aged youth (18+), adults and older adults, one FSP serves older adults only, another one serves TAY only, and two serve all ages. Further, one serves Asian -Pacific Islanders, one serves pre - adjudicated youth and TAY, and two support individuals experiencing or at risk of homelessness. A new FSP serving TAY (18+), adults and older adults will be added to Sacramento County's FSP service array this fiscal year. This new FSP will utilize the evidence -based Strengths case management model. While FSP program s provide the opportunity to better serve specific age and cultural groups who need a higher level of care, Sacramento County seeks to establish consistent FSP service guidelines, evaluate outcomes, and disseminate best practices across all FSP program s. Community members, staff, and clinicians have identified opportunities to strengthen the connection between client outcome goals and actual services received and provided by FSP programs. Providers and county department staff do not share a consistent, clear understanding of FSP service guidelines, and providers and peer agencies do not currently have a forum to meet regularly and share learnings and best practices or discuss opportunities. Overall, stakeholders would like to see FSP data used in an effective, responsive way that informs decision -making and improves service quality. Additionally, county staff would like to update inconsistent or outdated standards for referral, enrollment, and graduation. Description of the Response to Local Need Through this Innovation proposal, Sacramento County seeks to participate in the statewide initiative for the purpose of increasing counties' collective capacity to gather and use data to better design, implement, and manage FSP services. The key priorities outline d in the Innovation Plan (i.e., improve how counties define and track priority outcomes, develop processes for continuous improvement, develop a clear strategy for tracking outcomes and performance measures, updating and disseminating clear FSP service gui delines, improving enrollment and referral process implementation consistency) will allow Sacramento County to address current challenges and center FSP programs and services around meaningful outcomes for participants. More specifically, participating in this project and aligning with the identified priorities will enable Sacramento County to: Develop a clear strategy for how outcome goals and performance metrics can best be tracked using existing state and/or county -required tools to support meaningful c omparison, learning, and evaluation 33 Explore how appropriate goals and metrics may vary based on population (e.g., age, acuity, life domain example: homelessness, unemployment, etc.) Update and disseminate clear FSP service guidelines using a common FSP fra mework that reflects clinical best practices Create or strengthen mechanisms for sharing best practices and fostering cross -provider learning Improve existing FSP performance management practices (i.e., when and how often program data and progress towards goals is discussed, what data is included and in what format, how next steps and program modifications are identified) In addition, this project will provide Sacramento County the opportunity to share and exchange knowledge with other counties through the statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community . This learning will not only contribute to improved participant outcomes and program efficiency, but may also help facilitate statewide changes to data requirements. Description of the Local Community Plann ing Process The community planning process includes participation from the Sacramento County Mental Health Steering Act (MHSA) Steering Committee, Mental Health Board, Board of Supervisors, community based organizations, consumers and family members and co mmunity members. The community planning process helps the county determine where to focus resources and effectively utilize MHSA funds in order to meet the needs of the community. Since this process is ongoing, stakeholders will continue to receive updates and provide input in future meetings. The Multi -County FSP Innovation Project was introduced to stakeholders at the May 16, 2019 Mental Health Services Act Steering Committee meeting. Further, at the October 17, 2019 MHSA Steering Committee meeting, the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project was presented and discussed. The Steering Committee voted in full support of Sacramento County Division of Behavioral Health Services , opting into this project with Innovation funding. At the October 17, 2019 MHSA Steeri ng Committee meeting, 24 committee members were in attendance and 17 public members attended. The MHSA Steering Committee is comprised of one primary member and one alternate from the following groups: Sacramento County Mental Health Board; Sacramento Coun ty's Behavioral Health Director; three (3) Service Providers (Child, Adult, and Older Adult); Law Enforcement; Adult Protective Services/Senior and Adult Services; Education; Department of Human Assistance; Alcohol Drug Veterans; two (2) Transition Age Youth (TAY) Consumers; two (2) Adult Consumers; two (2) Older Adult Consumers; two (2) Family Members/Caregivers of Children age 0 - 17; two (2) Family Members/Caregivers of Adults age 18 - 59; two (2) Family Members/Caregivers of Older Adults age 60+; and one (1) Consumer At -large.

County Budget Narrative Sacramento County will contribute up to $500,000 over the 4.5 -year project period to support this statewide project. As of this time, Sacramento County intends to use MHSA Innovation funding subj ect to reversion at the end of FY19 -20 for the entirety of this contribution . As detailed below, Sacramento County will pool funding with other counties to support consultant and contracting costs. This $500,000 will support project management and technica l assistance (e.g. Third Sector's technical assistance in project implementation), fiscal intermediary costs, and evaluation. Budget and Funding Contribution by Fiscal Year and Specific Budget Category BUDGET BY FUNDING SOURCE AND FISCAL YEAR EXPENDITURES Personnel 36 Appendix: San Specific Dates Primary County Contacts: Francesca Michaels Francesca.michaels@dbh.sbcounty.gov , 909 -252-4068 Date Proposal w as posted for 30 -day Public Review: November 27, 2019 Date of Local Mental Health Board hearing: January 2, 2020 Calendared date to appear before Board of Supervisors : June 9, 2020 Description of the Local Need San Bernardino County Department of Behavioral Health is dedicated to including diverse consumers, family members, stakeholders, and community members in the planning a nd implementation of MHSA programs and services. The community planning process helps the county determine where to focus resources and effectively utilize MHSA funds in order to meet the needs of county residents. It empowers community members to generate ideas, contribute to decision making, and partner with the county to improve behavioral health outcomes for all San Bernardino County residents. San Bernardino is committed to incorporating best practices in the planning processes that allow consumer and stakeholder partners to participate in meaningful discussions around critical behavioral health issues. Since the community planning process is ongoing, stakeholders will continue to receive updates and provide input in future meetings. San Bernardino Coun ty has eight (8) FSP programs serving an estimated three thousand -four hundred - fifty-eight (3,458) individuals annually. Two (2) of these assist underserved children and youth living with serious emotional disturbance; one (1) serves Transitional Age Youth (TAY); four (4) serve adults with serious mental illness, and one (1) program specifically focuses on older adult populations. In addition to San Bernardino County FSP programs targeting specific age ranges, the programs are designed to serve unique popul ations such as those experiencing homelessness, who may be involved in criminal or juvenile justice, individuals transitioning from institutional care facilities, and high frequency users of emergency psychiatric services and hospitalizations, however all programs provide full wraparound services to the consumer. The specificity and number of these FSP programs are both an asset and a challenge. While they enable our county to better serve specific age, cultural, and geographic groups, our county stakeholde rs express the desire to establish consistency in FSP service guidelines or disseminate best practices across county regions, programs, or while transferring FSP services from one county to another. San Bernardino County intends to focus this project on Ad ult Full Service Partnership programs. Through public forums, community members have identified the need for consistency in FSP services across regions, programs, and counties to better serve and stabilize consumers moving from one geographic region or pr ogram to another. Consumers have also expressed interest in a standardized format for eligibility criteria and consistency in services that are offered and/or provided. Community members, FSP staff, and clinicians have also identified an opportunity for da ta collection to be better integrated with assessment and therapeutic activities. 37 Description of the Response to Local Need Through this Innovation proposal, San Bernardino County seeks to participate in the statewide initiative seeking to increase counti es' collective capacity to gather and use data to better design, implement, and manage Adult FSP programs and services. The key priorities outlined in the Innovation Plan (i.e., improve how counties define and track priority outcomes, develop processes for continuous improvement, develop a clear strategy for tracking outcomes and performance measures, updating and disseminating clear FSP service guidelines, improving enrollment and referral process implementation consistency) will allow San Bernardino Count y to address current challenges and center FSP programs and services around meaningful outcomes for participants. Specifically, participating in this project and aligning with the identified priorities will enable San Bernardino County to: Develop a clear strategy for how outcome goals and performance metrics can best be tracked using existing state and/or county -required tools to support meaningful comparison, learning, and evaluation Explore how appropriate goals and metrics may vary based on population (e.g., age, acuity, etc.) Update and disseminate clear FSP service guidelines using a common FSP framework that reflects clinical best practices Create or strengthen mechanisms for sharing best practices and fostering cross -provider learning Improve existi ng FSP performance management practices (i.e., when and how often program data and progress towards goals is discussed, what data is included and in what format, how next steps and program modifications are identified In addition, this project will provide San Bernardino County the opportunity to share and exchange knowledge with other counties through the statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community . This learning will not only contribute to improved participant outcomes and program efficiency, but may also help facilitate statewide changes to data requirements. Description of the Local Community Planning Process The community planning process helps the county determine where to focus resources and effectively utilize MHSA funds in order to meet the ne eds of county residents. The community planning process includes participation from adults and seniors with severe mental illness, families of children, adults, and seniors with severe mental illness, providers of services, law enforcement agencies, educat ion, social services agencies, veterans, representatives from veterans organizations, providers of alcohol and drug services, health care organizations, and other important interests including the Board of Supervisors, and the Behavioral Health Commission. Since the community planning process is ongoing, stakeholders will continue to receive updates and provide input in future meetings. The project was shared with stakeholders during the following: Community Advisory Policy Committee (CPAC), July 18, 2019 Asian Pacific Islander Awareness Subcommittee, September 13, 2019 Santa Fe Social Club, September 16, 2019 African American Awareness Subcommittee, September 16, 2019 38 Yucca Valley One Stop TAY Center, September 16, 2019 Native American Awareness Subcommittee, September 17, 2019 Transitional Age Youth (TAY) Subcommittee, September 18, 2019 Serenity Clubhouse, September 19, 2019 Co-Occurring and Substance Abuse Subcommittee, September 19, 2019 Consumer and Family Member Awareness Subcommittee, Septe mber 23, 2019 Central Valley FUN Clubhouse, September 24, 2019 Ontario One Stop TAY Center, September 25, 2019 Latino Awareness Subcommittee, September 26, 2019 Older Adult Awareness Subcommittee, September 26, 2019 A Place to Go Clubhouse, September 26, 2 019 Amazing Place Clubhouse, September 27, 2019 Victorville One Stop TAY Center, September 27, 2019 2nd and 4th District Advisory Committee, October 10, 2019 Disability Awareness Subcommittee, October 15, 2019 1st District Advisory Committee, October 16, 2 019 Community Advisory Policy Committee, October 17, 2019 LGBTQ Awareness Subcommittee, October 22, 2019 Women Awareness Subcommittee, October 23, 2019 Stakeholder feedback received was in favor of the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project with 96% of stake holders in support of the project, 4% neutral, and 0% opposed. A draft plan will be publicly posted for a 30 -day comment period tentatively beginning on November 27, 2019. No feedback was received . The Plan was presented before the San Bernardino County Be havioral Health Commission on January 2, 2020 . San Bernardino County will request Board of Supervisors review and final approval in February or March of 2020 (following the MHS OAC's review and approval process) . County Budget Narrative San Bernardino Count y requests to contribute a total of $979,634 in MHSA Innovation funds to support this project over the 4.5 -year project duration. This funding is not currently subject to reversion. A portion of these funds ($386,222) will cover San Bernardino County -specific expenditures, while the remainder ($593,412) will go towards the shared pool of resources that counties will use to cover shared project costs (i.e. Third Sector TA ; CalMHSA; th ird-party evaluation): Personnel Costs: Costs in this category include salaries and benefits for the time spent by .10 of the Innovation Program Manager as well .5 of the Program Specialist II who will be the lead on this project. Salaries and benefits inc lude a 3% increase to allow for cost of living increases each year. Based on current rates for administrative costs, San Bernardino County will allocate $349,272 for 4.5 years of personnel costs. Operating Costs: Costs in this category include travel and administrative costs that will be incurred by staff traveling to meetings for this project. Additional operating costs anticipated include printing materials for community stakeholder meetings, meeting space costs, as well as incentives to encourage stakeholder participation is consistent and ongoing. San Bernardino County anticipates 39 operating costs, including travel, up to $36,950 over the 4.5 years, or $7,390 per year, which may vary based on the number of staff traveling and the number of in -person meetings. Costs will also vary on the number of additional stakeholder meetings held. Consultant Costs: The remaining amount, $588,778, will support project management and technical assistance (e.g. Third Sector's tec hnical assistance in project implementation), fiscal intermediary costs (CalMHSA), and evaluation. The evaluation total for San Bernardino County's contribution is $41,668 or 4% of the allocated budget. The budget totals includes 36% of the budget for pers onnel costs with the remaining 64% going to direct costs associated with the project including county operating costs and the consultant costs. Note that all of San Bernardino's funding contributions would come from MHSA Innovation funding. See the below tables for an estimated breakdown of budget expenditures and requested funds by fiscal year . Budget and Funding Contribution by Fiscal Year and Specific Budget Category BUDGET BY FUNDING SOURCE AND FISCAL YEAR EXPENDITURES Personnel $11,355 $11,355 $593,412 Additional $73,177 $75,150 $77,184 41 Appendix: Siskiyou County Contact and Specific Dates The primary dates are listed in the table below. More detail on Siskiyou's stakeholder engagement process can be found in the \"Local Commun ity Planning Process\" section. Local Review Process Date Innovation Plan posted for 30 -day Public Review December 1 0, 2019 Local Mental Health Board Hearing January 21, 2020 Board of Supervisors (BOS) approval February 4 , 2020 Description of Local Need Siskiyou County operates two FSP programs, a Children's System of Care (CSOC) and an Adult System of Care (ASOC) program that combined serve approxima tely 230 individuals annually. Program eligibility is determined by diagnosis and risk factors pursua nt to the MHSA regulations for FSP criteria. Each Partner is assigned a clinician and case manager that work in the appropriate system of care as determined by the Partner's age. FSP program s may also receive psychiatric services and/or peer support servic es upon referral by the primary service provider. Many Partners also receive services through the county Wellness Center. Due to the specificity and flexibility of the FSP program, the county has encountered difficulty developing consistent FSP service gui delines, evaluating outcomes, and disseminating best practices. Siskiyou County utilizes the Data Collection Reporting (DCR) database developed by the State to track outcomes, however, this tool has not been useful with regard to informing treatment or pro moting quality improvements. Community stakeholders have consistently identified the need for clear, consistent and reliable data and outcomes to assist programs in identifying goals, measuring success and pinpointing areas that may need improvement. Throu ghout numerous focus groups where outcomes have been shared, the Department has recognized that consumers are not interested in the measurement of progress, rather they are solely focused on the amelioration of the problem. Therefore, Siskiyou County Behav ioral Health rarely receives feedback on outcome data and is evaluating the program in order to find a meaningful way in which to share the data that will encourage collaborative feedback. 42 Conversations with Siskiyou County FSP staff and clinicians have re vealed that outcome goals and metrics are not regularly reassessed or informed by community input, nor are they well -connected to actual services received and provided by FSP programs. There is not a shared, clear understanding of FSP service guidelines am ong providers and county department staff, and interpretation and implementation of these guidelines varies widely. Data is collected for compliance and does not inform decision -making or service quality improvements, and data is collected within one syste m, with limited knowledge of cross -agency outcomes. Further, standards for referral, enrollment, and graduation are inconsistent, outdated, or non -existent. Response to Local Need Through this Innovation proposal, Siskiyou County Behavioral Health seeks to participate in the statewide initiative to increase counties' collective capacity to gather and use data to better design, implement, and manage FSP services. The key priorities outlined in the Innovation Plan will allow Siskiyou County Behavioral Health to address current challenges and center FSP programs and services around meaningful outcomes for participants. More specifically, participating in this project and aligning with the identified priorities will enable the department to: 1. Develop a clear str ategy for how outcome goals and performance metrics can best be tracked using existing state and/or county -required tools to support meaningful comparison, learning, and evaluation. 2. Explore how appropriate goals and metrics may vary based on population. 3. Update and disseminate clear FSP service guidelines using a common FSP framework that reflects clinical best practices. 4. Create or strengthen mechanisms for sharing best practices and fostering cross -provider learning. 5. Improve existing FSP performance management practices (i.e., when and how often program data and progress towards goals is discussed, what data is included and in what format, how next steps and program modifications are identified). In addition, this project will provide Sisk iyou County Behavioral Health the opportunity to share and exchange knowledge with other counties through the statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community . Local Community Planning Process The community planning process helps Siskiyou County determine where to focus resources and effectively utilize MHSA funds in order to meet the needs of county residents. The community planning process includes participation from the Board of Supervisors, Behavioral Health Board, providers, consumers, community membe rs and partners. Since the community planning process is ongoing, stakeholders will continue to receive updates and provide input in future meetings. The project was shared in stakeholder groups in March 2019, where the proposed use of Innovation funds wa s well -received. A draft plan was posted for a 30 -day comment period beginning on December 10, 2019. No comments were received during the public comment period. Siskiyou present ed this plan 43 at a public hearing with the local mental health board on January 21, 2020 . Siskiyou County submitted a final plan (incorporating any additional feedback received) to its Board of Supervisors for review and approval on February 4, 2020. County Budget Narrative Siskiyou County will contribute up to $700,000 of MHSA Innov ation Funds over the 4.5 -year project period to support this statewide project. As of this time, Siskiyou County does not intend to use funding subject to reversion for this contribution. As detailed below, Siskiyou County will pool most of this funding with other counties to support consultant and contracting costs, with a small portion of Siskiyou County's funding also set aside for county staff travel and administrative costs: County Travel and Administrative Costs : Siskiyou County anticipates travel costs up to $16,000 over the 4.5 years, or approximately $3,500 per year, which may vary based on the number of staff traveling and the number of in -person convenings. Including estimated administrative costs, Siskiyou County will allocate approxima tely $ 178,000 for 4.5 years of personnel costs. Shared Project Costs : The remaining amount, $ 506,000 , will support project management and technical assistance (e.g. Third Sector's technical assistance in project implementation), fiscal intermediary costs, and third -party evaluation support Siskiyou County Budget Request and Expenditures by Fiscal Year BUDGET BY FUNDING SOURCE AND FISCAL YEAR EXPENDITURES Personnel $106,355 $106,355 $505,256 Additional $31,584 $63,986 $66,985 $121,450 $700,001 * Third Sector will provide additional support and capacity to Siskiyou County, beyond the amount Siskiyou is able to contribute using county Innovation dollars alone. This is intended to support the objectives of Third Sect or's contract with the Commission, i.e. that this Multi -County FSP Innovation Project make effort to support and provide meaningful capacity to counties with limited financial resources to participate in the project. 45 Appendix: Ventura County County Contac t and Specific Dates The primary contacts for Ventura County are: Kiran Sahota (805) 981 -8496 Ventura County's local review dates are listed in the table below. More detail on Ventura's stakeholder engagement process can be found in the \"Local Community Pla nning Process\" section. Local Review Process Date Innovation Plan posted for 30 -day Public Review December 1 7, 2019 Local Mental Health Board Hearing January 27, 20 20 Board of Supervisors (BOS) approval March 10, 2020 Description of Local Need Ventura County has 7 FSP programs serving 619 individuals in the 2018/19 fiscal year. Each of these programs has a specific focus, yet they overlap in the age groupings as compared to age groupings as prescribed by MHSA regulations. One (1) of these serves juveniles currently on probation, 1 of these programs serves transition age youth, 4 serve adults age 18 years and older, and another serves older adults. The majority of these programs focus on individuals who are currently experiencing or at risk of experiencing incarceration, substance abuse, or homelessness. Eligibility is determined by the following factors: experience or at risk of incarceration, substance abuse, homelessness, hospitalization, or removal from the home, as well as the individual's age and a case manager or clinician recommendation. The specificity and number of these FSP programs is both an asset and a challenge. While they enable our county to better serve specific age, cultural, and geographical groups, our county often struggles to establish consistent FSP service guidelines, evaluate outcomes, or disseminate best practices. A common, recurring theme at community engagement gatherings has resonated toward offering more concentrated care for the seriously and persistently mentally il l homeless population. Along this line, Ventura County conducted a Mental Health Needs Assessment recently that indicated a need to address issues of homelessness and dual diagnosis as priority populations. Ventura County FSP services are fewer for those u nder 18 years of age and with respect to ethnicity. There has been consistent communication in Santa Paula and Oxnard community meetings to stress the need to increase services in breadth and depth to the Latinx community. A more cohesive suite of services for step up and step 46 down crisis aversion. To this end, Ventura County has opened up two Crisis Stabilization Units in the past two years however the feedback continues to be that there is need for more to be done. Conversations with Ventura County FSP s taff and clinicians have revealed that outcome goals and metrics are not regularly reassessed or informed by community input, nor are they well -connected to actual services received and provided by FSP programs. There is not a shared, clear understanding o f FSP service guidelines among providers and county department staff \u2014interpretation and implementation of these guidelines varies widely. Further, there is not a standard documented model of care designed for each FSP age grouping (Youth, TAY, Adult, Older Adult). FSP has a different meaning and objectives within each group, but is not formally documented. As age categories are further documented, identifying the idiosyncratic challenges particular to each target group due to the needs being very different. Staff and clinicians have also indicated that data is collected for state mandated compliance and does not inform decision -making or service quality improvements. In addition, data is collected within one system, but outcomes are designed to be measured with cross -agency data collection systems (such as health care, criminal justice, etc.) meaning many counties are reliant on self -reported progress toward outcomes rather than verified sources. Providers and peer agencies do not have a forum to meet regula rly and share learnings and best practices or discuss opportunities. Standards for referral, enrollment, and graduation are inconsistent or outdated. Finally, there is a need for more clarity in the understanding of FSP funding allowances. The \"whatever it takes\" category is especially open to interpretation and there's no standard across counties to compare approved expenditures or to know what resources are available through FSP funds Response to Local Need Through this Innovation proposal, Ventura County seeks to participate in the statewide initiative to increase counties' collective capacity to gather and use data to better design, implement, and manage FSP services. The key priorities outlined in the Innovation Plan will allow Ventura County Behavioral Health to address current challenges and center FSP programs and services around meaningful outcomes for participants. More specifically, participating in this project and aligning with the identified priorities will enable the department to: 1. Develop a c lear strategy for how outcome goals and performance metrics can best be tracked using existing state and/or county -required tools to support meaningful comparison, learning, and evaluation. 2. Explore how appropriate goals and metrics may vary based on popula tion. 3. Update and disseminate clear FSP service guidelines using a common FSP framework that reflects clinical best practices. 4. Create or strengthen mechanisms for sharing best practices and fostering cross -provider learning. 5. Improve existing FSP performance management practices (i.e., when and how often program data and progress towards goals is discussed, what data is included and in what format, how next steps and program modifications are identified). 47 In addition, this project will provide Vent ura County Behavioral Health the opportunity to share and exchange knowledge with other counties through the statewide Outcomes -Driven FSP Learning Community . Local Community Planning Process The community planning process helps Ventura County determine where to focus resources and effectively utilize MHSA funds in order to meet the needs of county residents. The community planning process includes participation from the Board of Supervisors, B ehavioral Health Advisory Board, providers, and community members. Since the community planning process is ongoing, stakeholders will continue to receive updates and provide input in future meetings. The project was shared in the following Behavioral Heal th Advisory Board subcommittee meetings: Adult Committee on Thursday, November 7, 2019 Executive Meeting on Tuesday, November 12, 2019 Prevention Committee on Tuesday, November 12, 2019 Youth & Family Committee on Wednesday, November 13, 2019 TAY Committee on Thursday, November 21, 2019 General Meeting on Monday, November 18, 2019 This project was shared as a part of the 3 year -plan update in the section of proposed use of Innovation funds. A more detailed draft plan proposal w as posted for a 30 -day public comment period beginning on December 16 , 2019. The Behavioral Health Advisory Board held a public hearing on the proposed plan on January 27 , 2020. The plan will be revised based on any feedback received, after which it is scheduled to go before the Ventur a County Board of Supervisors for review and final approval on March 10, 2020 . County Budget Narrative Ventura County will contribute $979,634 using MHSA Innovation funds over the 4.5 -year project period to support this statewide project. As of this time, Ventura County intends to use funding subject to reversion at the end of FY 19 -20 for the entirety of this contribution. As detailed below, Ventura County will pool most of this funding with other counties to support consultant and contracting costs, wit h a small portion of Ventura County's funding also set aside for county staff travel and administrative costs: County Travel and Administrative Costs: Ventura County anticipates travel costs up to $13,000 over the 4 years, or $3,000 per year, which may var y based on the number of staff traveling and the number of in -person convening's. Based on current rates for administrative costs, Ventura County will allocate $296,801 for 4 years of personnel costs. The following positions have been allocated at a few ho urs annually over the next few years in order to achieve the project goals of system change. o Senior Project Manager o Program Administrator o Quality Assurance Administrator 48 o Electronic Health Record System Coordinator o Behavioral Health Clinician Shared Project Costs: The remaining amount, $593,412 will support project management and technical assistance (e.g. , Third Sector's technical assistance in project implementation), fiscal intermediary costs, and evaluation.

This plan has been approv ed by the commission and thus. A dditional appendix detail on local need is not included here as this information is more comprehensively outlined in Fresno's Innovation Plan proposal. A summary of Fresno's approved budget follows below. Note that the approved Fresno County budget includes costs for Third Sector, CalMHSA and the third -party evaluation in a single total under \"Other Project Expenditures\"), approximately $840,000 total ove r the 4.5 years. COUNTY BUDGET REQUEST $237,500 $0 $950,000 BUDGET BY FUNDING $950,000 52 Appendix: San Mateo County Budget Tables As noted above, San Mateo County does not have MHSA INN funds available to commit to this project, but instead intends to use unspent MHSA CSS funds to participate in the goals and activities of this project, alongside other counties. These are one -time funds that have be en designated and approved through a local Community Program Planning (CPP) process to meet a similar purpose and set of objectives as the Multi -County FSP Innovation Project . Local Community Planning Process On October 2, 2019, the San Mateo County MHSA Steering Committee reviewed a \"Plan to Spend \" one- time available funds, developed from input received through the following: The previous MHSA Three -Year Plan CPP process - 32 community input sessions Behavioral Health and Recovery Services budget planning - 3 stakeholder meetings Additional t argeted input sessions to further involve community -based agencies, peers, clients and family members in the development of the Plan to Spend including: o MHSARC Older Adult Committee - June 5, 2019 o MHSARC Adult Committee - June 19, 2019 o MHSARC Youth Committee - June 19, 2019 o Contractor's Association - June 20, 2019 o Office of Consumer and Family Affairs/Lived Experience Workgroup - July 2, 2019 o Peer Recovery Collaborative - August 26, 2019 The Plan to Spend included $500,000 to better align San Mateo's San Mateo's FSP programming with BHRS goals/values and improve data collection and reporting. The proposed Multi -County FSP Innovation Project was brought forward as the means to accomplish this goal. San Mateo's local mental health board, the Mental Health and Substance Abuse and Recovery Commission (MHSARC), reviewed the Plan to Spend and on November 6, 2019 held a public hearing, reviewed comment s received and voted to close the 30 -day public comment period. The Plan to Spend was subsequently approved by the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors on April 7, 2020. The Plan to Spend also included $250,000 for any ongoing needs related to FSP progr am improvements. San Mateo has brought forward the proposed Multi -County FSP Innovation Project as the means to accomplish this longer -term goal. The update to the Plan to Spend will be included in the current San Mateo County FY 2020 -2023 Three -Year Plan and Annual Update, which will be brought to the San Mateo County Board of Supervisors for approval, likely in August 2020. San Mateo is not submitting a proposal to use INN funds . Detailed appendix information is thus not included below, though a summary of San Mateo's intended funding amounts and expenditures follows below. Note that, like other counties, these amounts are subject to change and further local input and approval. COUNTY BUDGET REQUEST BY $0 $0 $0 $750,000 53 BUDGET BY FUNDING $750,000 54 APPEND & EARLY INTERVENTION EVALUAT ION FY 2016/2017 & 2017/2018 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY San Mate o County funded 20 program utilizing Prevention and Early Intervention fund during fiscal years (FY) 2016 -2017 and 2017 -2018. Most of SMC PEI programs are delivered by community -based providers and they serve children, adults, older adults as well as margin alized and diverse populations. Approximately 32,630 community members received services; and they range d from trainings, psycho -education workshops, teacher consultations, summer employment, direct treatment to fun family events . INTRODUCTION OVERVIEW Prevention and Early Intervention (PEI) is one of the five components of MHSA. This component has its own reporting requirements, the most updated reporting requirements were implemented June 2018 by the California Mental Health Services Oversight and Acco untability Commission (MHSOAC). PEI targets individuals of all ages prior to the onset of mental illness, except for early onset of psychotic disorders. PEI emphasizes reducing the seven negative outcomes of untreated mental illness; suicide; incarceration ; school failure or pushout; unemployment; prolonged suffering; homelessness; and removal of children from their homes. PEI REGULATIONS In June 2018 , the PEI regulations were amended, and specific requirements were added that include indicators, data trackers, the explanation of a 3 -year evaluation plan, annual evaluation report and the PEI component of a 3 -year plan. PROGRAM CATEGORIES Prevention - Set of related activities to reduce risk factors for developing a potentially serious mental illness and to build protective factors. Prevention program services may include relapse prevention for individuals in recovery from a serious mental illness. Early Intervention - Treatment and other services and interventions, including relapse prevention, to address and promote recovery and related functional outcomes for a mental illness early in its emergence, including negative outcomes that may result from untreated mental illness. Early Intervention program services may include services to parents, caregivers, and other family members of the person with early onset of a mental illness as applicable. Services shall not exceed 18 months, unless the individual re ceiving service is identified as experiencing first onset of a serious mental illness or emotional disturbance with psychotic features, in which case early intervention services shall not exceed four years. Outreach for increasing recognition of early si gns of mental illness - The process of engaging, encouraging, educating, and/or training and learning from potential responders (family, school personnel, peer providers, etc.) about ways to recognize and respond effectively to early signs of potentially se vere and disabling mental illness. Outreach for increasing recognition of early signs of mental illness may include reaching out to individuals with signs and symptoms of a mental illness, so they can recognize and respond to their own symptoms. Stigma a nd Discrimination reduction program - The County's direct activities to reduce negative feelings, attitudes, beliefs, perceptions, stereotypes and /or discrimination related to being diagnosed with a mental illness, having a mental illness, or to seeking mental health services and to increase acceptance, dignity, inclusion and equity for individuals with mental illness, and members of their families. Access to linkage and treatment program - A set of related activities to connect children, adults and seniors with severe mental illness, as earl y in the onset of these conditions as practicable, to medically necessary care and treatment, including, but not limited to, care provided by county mental health programs (e.g. screening, assessment, referral, telephone help lines, and mobile response). Suicide prevention program - Organized activities that the County undertakes to prevent suicide because of mental illness. PEI STRATEGIES All programs need to be designed and implemented to further at least one of these strategies: Create access and lin kage to treatment - See above definition Timely access to mental health services for individuals and families from underserved population - To increase the extent to which an individual or family from an underserved population who needs mental health servic es because of risk or presence of a mental illness received appropriate services as early in the onset as practicable, through program features such as accessibility, cultural and language appropriateness, transportation, family focus, hours available, and cost of services. Services shall be provided in a convenient, accessible, acceptable, culturally appropriate setting. Non stigmatizing and Non -Discriminatory Practices - Promoting, designing, and implementing programs in ways that reduce and circumvent s tigma, including self -stigma, and discrimination related to being diagnosed with a mental illness, having a mental illness or seeking mental health services accessible, welcoming, and positive. DATA SOURCES AND ANALYSIS A mixed -methods research framework was used to conduct this evaluation plan and included both qualitative and quantitative data that was provided by our contractors and staff. While a standardization of data is our goal , currently there are some variations across programs that reflect staffing capacity, technology access and the differences between target populations. However, all our PEI programs have been implemented and designed to work towards reaching PEI goals consistent with MHSA legislation. The d ata sources that were used for the completion of this report were the following: 1) MHSA ANNUAL REPORT T EMPLATES In 2017 a new MHSA annual report template was created to standardize information collected. Each contractor is responsible for completing this template on an annual basis. Currently the template collects metrics such as unduplicated number of clients served, demographics, outcomes as well as narrative regarding program activities, interventions, program successes and challenges. This template con tinues to be refined as we adhere to new PEI guidelines as well as customize to program needs. 2) KEY STAKEHOLDER INTE RVIEWS Some of the data analysis and collection of PEI programs is done externally through a contract with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) . To supplement this quantitative data analysis and give context to data collection key stakeholder interviews were conducted with these programs. 3) PROGRAM TRACKING LOG S AND SIGN -IN SHEETS Internal PEI programs use tracking lo gs and sign in sheets to document the number of clients, outreach, and referrals made. Some tracking sheets are also online through survey monkey and are analyzed by AIR. 4) PROGRAM TOOLS/SURVEY S Many of the PEI programs use pre -post test program surveys to collect outcome data as well as client satisfaction with the program. These surveys include Likert scales, open ended questions, and capture a variety of outcomes such as changes in attitude, knowledge, beh aviors. Measures also capture the increase in protective factors to mental illness as well as social -emotional wellbeing and use of new skills. The use of pre and post tests are being reviewed to make sure they align with the outcome metrics we hope to collect acro ss programs. 5) PREVIOUS EVALUATION REPORTS For fiscal years 2013 -2014 as well as 2014 -2015 a n independent evaluation consultant was hired to evaluate MHSA funded programs. This consultant was able to evaluate whether program s were implemented efficiently, how effective the strategies were, the state of client satisfaction, responsiveness to target population, how programs advanced the MHSA vision as well as recommendations for improvement. This initial evaluation report served as a starting point for this evaluation plan. OPPORTUNITIES FOR IM PROVEMENT San Mateo County has had extremely limited organizational capacity due to the staffing of the MHSA team. Currently, the MHSA team includes the MHSA coordinator , and one Community Health Planner that assist with various MHSA administrative and programmatic duties . A dedicated PEI Coordinator would make it easier to monitor PEI data collection, oversight, as well as the structure and maintenance of new MHSA requirements and regulations. Cont ract monitoring for our some of our programs is done through clinical supervisors who are expected to meet with contractors regularly, however due to increased workloads, this is not always possible and p laces a strain on ou r workforce's ability to engage in meaningful oversight. Additionally, another challenge we face is that there is no PEI database or centralized portal for data collection. This poses a challenge for data collection because different contractors and internal programs have varying level s of understanding when it comes to data reporting, measurements and the requirements for PEI funded programs. We can capture data with Electronic Health Records for other MHSA programs; however, these systems are not integrated into PEI programs. Furtherm ore, since there is no centralized system it is difficult to make comparisons from year to year effectively. This affects coordination and our ability to implement data driven quality improvement strategies that are needed across our system of care. Recently, through a local stakeholder planning process, $200,000 one -time available funds was allocated for this purpose and we look forward to implementing this priority next fiscal year (FY) 2020 -21. STRENGTHS San Mateo County has imp lemented 19 different PEI programs, that provide services to a variety of target populations, are located across our county and work to prevent the negative outcomes associated with mental illness as well as severe mental illness. Our most current PEI budg et for FY 2020 -21 is $7 million with 51% allocation to Children and Transitional Age Youth (TAY) ages 0 -25. Additionally, as mentioned previously, SMC engaged in an evaluation process for FY 2013 -2014 and FY 2014 -2015 . Programs have been added since then however , the recommendations from the evaluator enabled SMC to implement several changes that are the building blocks for systems change and is congruent with thoughtful PEI evaluation. Some of these changes include addi ng detailed evaluation requirements to the Request for Proposal (RFP) process. This section includes requirements for evaluation tools, data collection frequency and analysis. The contracting process has also changed, when our last evaluation occurred , man y of the PEI contracts did not have deliverable requirements, now contracts include expectations of deliverables which include minimum numbers for outreach, groups, events, workshops, and presentations etc. The most recent contracts for new programs to be implemented in the future have included the requirement for client/family satisfaction with the program, specific validated scales to be used pre and post to collect data on outcomes and updated demographic forms for participants. Another strength that was found when reviewing PEI programs is our compliance with the new regulations that state, that each PEI programs need to fall within each of the six strategies mentioned above. The PEI programs that have been implemented thus far a lso further the strategies required by the new regulations which are: Create access to linkage and treatment Timely access to mental health services for individuals and families from underserved populations Non -stigmatizing and non -discriminatory Furthermore, within SMC the MHSA team is housed under the Office of Diversity and Equity (ODE) , which results in all MHSA PEI programs being designed, implemented, and evaluated with an equity lens. The Office of Diversity and Equity serves Behavioral Health a nd Recovery services, but also influences and touches many parts of S an Mateo County Health. Having MHSA housed under ODE enables the administrative team to stay close to community partners, stakeholders, as well as clients and family members. These sustai ned relationships have developed into meaningful partnerships that optimize our ability to stay co nnected to community so that the voice of marginalized communities is always at the center of all the work that is carried out; from the three -year planning process, the design and implementation of programs , needs assessments, as well as advance systems change policies. MOVING FORWARD Based on the findings of this report, some system improvement needs, oversight limitations and data co llection needs have been identified. First, we acknowledge that currently we do not have the staffing or structure to carry out an evaluation internally. To be able to comply with the new PEI requirements below are some action steps that need to be impleme nted to make the evaluation of PEI programs sustainable, meaningful and community centered. There are several programs in this report that use the number of clients served as their only outcome. The data reporting for these programs is out of compliance wi th new regulations that ask for specific metrics such as # of referrals, time from initial contact to engaging in services etc. Below are the action steps that SMC will take to ensure that data collection of the PEI programs is in compliance and used meaningfully to evaluate success, as well as improvement. CONTRACT AN EXTERNAL EVALUATOR : Due to limited staffing capacity, an evaluator from an outside agency will be contracted to guide the PEI evaluation process, outcomes, and implementatio n of tools. They will work with PEI administration staff to meet with contract monitors, contract agencies, establish and implement outcome metrics for each of the programs. The standardized outcome template will be changed to reflect specific data require ments. The outcome metrics will be developed with contractors, clients/family members as well as staff to ensure outcomes that they are representative of the work being done, that they fulfill the PEI requirements and are meaningful to the community . This will enable us to develop an evaluation plan that is culturally competent and includes the perspective of diverse people with lived experience. HOLD REGULAR MEETINGS WITH CONTRA CT MONITORS : These meetings will be held with each of the contract monitors t o update and provide them with the new PEI regulations. It will enable us to gain understand as to their involvement with the contractor, familiarity with the data requirements and establish oversight procedures for data collection. HOLD REGULAR MEETINGS WITH PEI PROGRAMS AND CONTRACT AGENCIES : These meetings will be held with each of the contractors regarding implementation, data collection and analysis. One of the recommendations from our previous evaluator was that contract agencies needed training on data collection. These preliminary meetings will serve to gauge the capacity of the agency, obtain feedback on outcome measures and tools proposed, creation of a PEI data base, and review of the new PEI guidelines as well as updated expectations and potent ial contract amendments. DEVELOP A PEI DATABASE: Currently, data collection is not standardized. Many programs submit annual reports with qua ntitative data that changes from year to year based on their capacity/turn over and many outcomes are based on what the agencies deem to be meaningful at the time. With the standardization of outcome metrics and reporting, as well as a centralized data base, it wil l enable us to make data driven systems improvements, compare year to year outcomes and comply with PEI regulations. CREATE PROTOCOLS: Formal written protocols are needed for PEI programs, these protocols would include communication of PEI requirements, clear expectations of what needs to be completed by each program, who is responsible for each task assigned, as well as timelines for all activities. These protocols would specify the expectations around data collection, the role of the contract monitors and reporting expectations, such as quarterly reports, and annual reports for programming. PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTI ON AGES 0 -25 The following programs serve children and transitional age youth 0 -25 exclusively. Some programs serve both population s. The MHSA guidelines require 19% of spending to fund PEI and of that 51% of the PEI budget is required to fund programs for children and youth. In San Mateo County there are f ive programs that serve this age group. Other programs in our PEI category als o serve this age group, however it is not exclusively. These programs serve several special populations and are found in geographically underserved areas of the county. These programs include consultations with teachers, parents, workshops, outreach as wel l as employment. 910 total c lients served EARLY CHILDHOOD COMM UNITY TEAM ECCT employs both prevention (60%) and early intervention (40%) strategies. ECCT incorporates several major components that build on current models in the community, to support healthy social emotional development of young children. The ECCT delivers three distinct service modalities that serve at risk children and families: 1) Clinical Services, 2) Case management/Parent Education services, and 3) Mental health consultations with childcare and early child development program staff and parents served by these centers. In addition, the ECCT team conducts extensive outreach in the community to build a more collaborative, interdisciplinary system of services for infants, toddlers, and families. The ECC T focuses services on the Coastside community - a low -income, rural, geographically isolated community . To better serve this disperse community, ECCT has built strong PEI Ages 0 -25 Early Childhood Community Team (ECCT) Project SUCCESS Seeking Safety Teaching Pro Social Crisis Hotline, Youth Outreach and Intervention Team relationships with key community partners and successfully refers families to the local school district, other StarVista services, Coastside Mental Health clinic and Pre -to-Three Program, among others. METHODS ECCT is a program with three service modalities some of which are evidence based and others are promising practices. PROGRAM STRATEGIES PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA EECT served 213 clients in fiscal years 16/17 and 17/18. The demographic data in this section represents unduplicated data provided by those who were active in the program. The data shows that those who were most served were Latinos, as well as Spanish speakers. This is Timely Access to Mental Health Services for Individuals and Families from Underserved Populations Non -Stigmatizing and Non -Discriminatory Practices 213 clients served 39 teachers served 51 families received mental health services 50 children and their families received weekly child -parent psychotherapy services 18 families received intensive case consultation congruent with the programs target population, as well as county wide demographic data that shows that Latinos from this region experience mental health challenges at a higher rate than other eth nic groups. OUTCOMES ECCT tracks outcomes via the Child Behavioral Checklist that is filled out by the client's teachers, teacher satisfaction surveys, parent satisfaction surveys as well as informal conversation and observation.

Project SUCCESS is designed for use with youth ages 9 -18 and includes parents as collaborative partners in prevention through parent education programs. Clinical staff trained in culturally competent practices ran all the groups. The school district's small size provides an opportunity for every student in the district, ages 9 -18, to participate in one or more Project SUCCESS activities. All groups were offered in English and in Spanish. METHODS Project SUCCESS is a SAMHSA model program that prevents and reduces substance use and abuse a nd associated behavioral problems among high risk; multi -problem youth ages 9 -18. It is an evidence -based program. PROGRAM STRATEGIES PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS 222 clients served 84 families served Create Access to Linkage and Treatment DEMOGRAPHIC DATA Project SUCCESS served 2 22 clients in fiscal years 16/17 and 17/18. The demographic data in this section represents unduplicated data provided by those who were active in the program. The data shows that those who were most served were L atinos . This is congruent with the programs target population, as well as county wide demographic data that shows that Latinos from this region experience mental health challenges at a higher rate than other ethnic groups. OUTCOMES Project SUCCESS tracks outcomes via the Developmental Asset Profile that is filled out by the students and analyzed by the Search Institute. The Developmental Asset profile incorporated 40 developmental assets framework that addresses the needs of young people in the community. This survey focuses on understanding the strengths and supports (or Developmental Assets) that young people experience in their lives. These assets are tied to young people making positive life choices. Research has shown that youth with hig her level of assets are more likely to; do better in school, be prepared for post -high school graduation and careers, contribute more to their communities and society and avoid high risk behaviors, such as violence, substance abuse and sexual activity. COMPOSITE ASSETS SCOR E This score shows the percentage of youth who fall into four levels based on their survey results, each score is out of 60: challenged (0 -29); vulnerable (30 -41); adequate S P A N I C / L A T I N O C A U C A S I A N / W H I T E A F R I C A N - A M E R I C A N / B L A C KM U L T I -E T H N I C O T H E OF PARTICIPANTS RACE/ETHNICITYRACE/ETHNICITY FY 16/17 FY 17/18FY 16/17 54% of the youth scored in the adequate and thriving level, and about 11% of the youth scored as challenged. This composite score sheds light on the foundation of assets that youth have. A further look at the data suggests that the groups that have the low est composite scores are Latinos (40.3) as well as 8th graders and 11th graders which mark years of transition. FY 17/18 58% of the youth scored in the adequate and thriving level, and about 1 -% of the youth scored as challenged. A further look at the data suggests that the groups with the lowest composite scores are Latinos (36.7) as well as 8th graders and 10th graders. ASSET CATEGORY SCORE S The framework of the Developmental Assets is organized into eight categories which are shown below. These categories represent key supports (external assets) and strengths (internal assets) that young people need to have and develop in order to thrive. The external assets are relationships and opportunities provided by f amily, school, and community. The internal assets are internal values, commitments, skills, and self -perception that young people develop within themselves that lead to self -regulation, internal motivation, and personal character. A youth who can make posi tive life choices, need to have both external and internal assets . FY 16/17 The survey results show that the relative areas of strength are Support, Boundaries and Expectations. The areas that are not as strong are Positive Identity, Commitment to Learning, and Constructive Use of time. When analyzing the data more closely, Latino youth struggle with Po sitive Identity the most. FY 17/18 The survey showed that the relative areas of strength are Support and Boundaries and Expectations. The categories that are not as strong are Social Competencies and Positive Identity. When analyzing the data more closely, Latinos continue to struggle with Positive Identity more so than any other asset category. Project SUCCESS has increased the composite asset scores as well as the asset category scores for the past two years. These results show that the foundations for youth assets is continuing to strengthen as youth go through the program. Puente was also able to extend their programs to all 5th to 12th graders in the school districts of Pescadero and La Honda, which gives the agency the potential to touch all the students in these school districts. QUALITATIVE DATA Our families struggle with domestic violence, sexual abuse, family drug and alcohol abuse, and for many of our migrant families who are monolingual Spanish, their children learn English and are then expected to take on enormous amounts of responsibilit y. Our programs give families access to tools like mental health, referrals, and parent education in their own communities. SEEKING SAFETY Seeking Safety is a curriculum that focuses on environmental and treatment solutions for substance use and Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder and relies on strong case management direction and referrals to community resources. Seeking Safety groups address the needs of this age group by utilizing a developmental framework that provides general supports for young adults, such as safety, relationship building, youth participation, community resources, and skill building. By incorporating these practices into the group framework, youth learned to build upon internal and external assets which are essential for a healthy transition to young adulthood. The age group for this program is Transitional Age Youth 18 to 25. METHODS Seeking Safety is an evidence -based program that is a present -focused model to help people attain safety from trauma and/or substance abuse. It is a safe model as it addresses both trauma and substance use, but without requiring clients to delve into traum a narrative. PROGRAM STRATEGIES PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA Seeking Safety served 113 youth in fiscal years 16/17 and 17/18. They did not collect any race/ethnicity demographic data for the dates that this report covers. Additionally, the Seeking Safety program was ended in June 2018. From preliminary data shared w ith us, most of the participants identified as cis gendered male. 113 clients served 265 groups were held serving TAY Timely Access to Mental Health Services for Individuals and Families from Underserved Populations The language preference data shows that most of the participants were English speaking, however over 20% were Spanish speakers. When looking closely at the data, most of the Spanish speak ers accessed this program in Redwood City versus Halfmoon Bay. In FY 16/17 the data read that in Redwood City 70% of participants were bilingual and in Halfmoon Bay 100% were bilingual. OUTCOMES This program was able to provide us with only qualitative data for their evaluation in the form of a client story. QUALITATIVE DATA 77.5% 22.5% E N G L I S H S P A N I S H PREFERRED LANGUAGE FY17/18 Mark is a 24 -year -old, single, Latino male. He had multiple arrests including, felonies. He went to El Centro to receiv e treatment for his substance abuse to methamphetamines, heroin, cannabis, and alcohol. He attained abstinence form all drugs through treatment and guidance of the program. He signed up for college courses, re -established relationships with his family and found housing as well as employment. After 10 months he completed his outpatien t program, and both his Fall and Spring college courses with passing grades. Has strengthened his relationship with his family and has built a foundation for recovery. TEACHING PRO SOCIAL The purpose of TPS is to help elementary school children learn pro -social skills to improve their social and behavioral functioning in school. TPS serves children in San Mateo County where Family Resource Centers (FRC) are located, and these centers include mental health programming. FRC's are available at schools that have high needs am ong the student population and a lack of other resources available to the broader community. Underserved students face greater academic and social struggles and benefit from a pro social skills group that is culturally sensitive. METHODS TPS is a ten-week program that uses \"skill streaming\" an evidence -based, social skills training program designed to improve students' behaviors, replacing less productive ones. PROGRAM STRATEGIES \"The encouragement, support and guidance that he received at El Centro have empowered him and enabled him to build a stronger foundation for himself\" Timely Access to Mental Health Services for Individuals and Families from Underserved Populations Non -Stigmatizing and Non -Discriminatory Practices PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA TPS served 152 clients in fiscal years 16/17 and 17/18. The demographic data in this section represents unduplicated data provided by those who were active in the program. The data shows that those who were most served were Latinos. Additionally, in fiscal year 16/17 th ere was more of a demand for Spanish sessions. TPS is implemented by bilingual staff.

This tool is a 60 -item survey that asks teachers to rank 60 positive behaviors, then based off this survey the curriculum for the groups are implemente d in a series of six to ten sessions each semester. The teachers choose their top 10 social skills from the survey and they pretest their students in each skill included in the curriculum and then fill out a post -test after. Satisfaction surveys are also used, for the parents and teachers. 43% 53% 4%100% E N G L I S H S P A N I S H O T H E Taft 1 1 4 4 Hoover 3 1 14 3 Fair Oaks 1 1 4 6 Belle Haven 3 4 0 23 Brentwood 2 9 Bayshore 2 2 13 12 Sunset Ridge 2 13 LEAD 3 19 Puente 2 8 Total 17 11 76 56 Consistent communication among facilitators, teachers, school staff, and parents Positive behavior changes such as friendship making skills, and aggression TPS homework was completed with more frequency due to higher parent involvement Lead facilitators observed significant behavior changes among students in areas of: understanding and coping with their feelings, dealing with anger, apologizing, empathy and self - control. Improvements in scores between pre and post test indicate progress for the majority of participants FEEDBACK POSSIBLE OUTCOME MET RICS Improve performance in school Increase awareness of mental health wellness and recovery Reduce stigma YOUTH CRISIS RESPONS E & PREVENTION The Crisis Intervention & Suicide Prevention Center (CISPC) has four components with the sole purpose of providing crisis and suicide support to a ll ages of the SMC community. The four components include: a 24/7 Crisis Hotline, a youth website and teen chat service, outreach and training and mental health services. This team employs both early intervention (70%) and prevention (30%). METHODS Yout h Crisis Response and Prevention is an evidence -based practice withs components embedded that are promising practices. PROGRAM STRATEGIES Teachers requested that groups be provided more frequently such as twice per week and held at varied times so a student would not miss too much for one clas s Weekly emails informing teachers what skill was taught that week so they could support the skill in class Create Access to Linkage and Treatment PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA Youth Crisis Response and Prevention did not report any demographic data for FY 16/17 or 17/18. OUTCOMES The CISPC program impacts the health outcomes of clients served in several ways including; the reduction of stigma, talking non -judgmentally about mental illnesses, mitigating undiagnosed mental illnesses, prevention and early recognition for youth, and su icide prevention. Below is the quantitative data recorded for delivery of each service.

Volunteer was able to offer support, and tools. The caller was able to feel better and expressed her gratitu de with the service. Reduction of stigma associated with mental illness through psychoeducational presentations, working with clients in crisis, and conversations with hotline callers A mother called the mental health clinician concerned about her adolescent son who was suicidal. The clinician assessed the child and began short term therapy when it was clear there was no immediate risk. His main source of stress was school, he needed an IEP. The clinician helped him and his mother through that process. His suicidal thoughts decreased to zero. EARLY INTERVENTION The following programs are Early Intervention programs. These programs provide treatment and other services and interventions including relapse preventions, to address and promote recovery and related functional outcomes for a mental illness early in its emergence. Programs in this category include emergency response teams, referrals, as well as programs. 9347 Clients served EARLY PSYCHOSIS PROG RAM -RE(MIND) Re (MIND) identifies and intervenes with individuals experiencing a recent onset episode of psychosis. By intervening early with evidence based, culturally responsive, and comprehensive assessment and tre atment, the impact of psychosis can be transformed and treated to remission. The program provides treatment and support for the client and family through an intensive outpatient model of care. METHODS Early Psychosis - Re (MIND) /BEAM integrated five evidence -based practices into a single treatment approach. PROGRAM STRATEGIES Timely Access to Mental Health Services for Individuals and Families from Underserved Populations Early Intervention Early Psychosis Program - Re(MIND)/BEAM Primary Care Interface SMC Mental Health Assessment and Referral Team PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA Re (Mind) /BEAM served 214 clients in FY 16/17 and 17/18. The racial group that is most represented in services are the Caucasian/white population. Most clients were 16 -25 years old. 214 clients served 3,271 sessions of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Early Psychosis (CBTp) 538 sessions of Family Support Services 645 sessions of Peer Support Services 1,568 sessions of Education/Employment & Case Management 830 medication management consultations Non -Stigmatizing and Non -Discriminatory Practices OUTCOMES The BEAM program is evaluated via a series of surveys that include, California Department of health Care Services Consumer Perception Survey to evaluate participants satisfaction and quality of life. Hospitalization data are collected through the county da tabase (AVATAR) and entered into Felton's EHR database. Medication adherence and symptom reduction data is collected using the Adult Needs and Strengths Assessment (ANSA). Supportive Employment and Education Services (SEES) are tracked via an internal trac ker to provide education and employment data for participants. SEES staff and Director work to update the spreadsheets and database monthly . As seen below the PREP program was changed to BEAM halfway through 17/18. However, both programs saw positive outco mes in hospitalization reduction, medication adherence increase, vocational and educational engagement, and service satisfaction. Overall, the outcomes show that clients who participate in this program experience reduced acute hospitalizations, increase their medication adherence, and can engage in part time or full- time school or work. Additionally, the great majority are satisfied with services and report an increase in quality of life due to this program. 11% 78% 17/18 Development of new peer and family activity groups to foster connection and recovery. Additional weekly soci al networking/ activity group and biweekly teen and adult peer support group. Implementation of a Quarterly Community Advisory Board that has met three times and included participation of family members and staff. Board gives stakeholders the opportunity to inform the service delivery system and better meet the needs of the community especially cultural needs PRIMARY CARE INTERFA CE Primary Care Interface focuses on identifying persons in need of behavioral health services in the primary care setting. BHRS clinicians are embedded in primary care clinics to facilitate referrals, perform assessments, and refer to appropriate behavioral health services if deemed necessary. The model utilizes essential elements of the IMPACT model to identify and treat individua ls in primary care who do not have Serious Mental Illness (SMI) and are unlikely to seek services from the formal mental health system. This program also provides services to those with ACE coverage who otherwise would not be able to access these services. Services include harm reduction, psychoeducation , and motivational interviewing by case manager. METHODS Primary care interface is an evidence -based practice that uses elements of the IMPACT model. PROGRAM STRATEGIES PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA The Primary Interface program did not report demographic data for FY 16/17 and 17/18. 3,642 clients served Create Access to Linkage and Treatment OUTCOMES POSSIBLE OUTCOME MET RICS Improve access to linkages for services Reduce the number of hospitalizations Increase individual engagement in services/improve continuity of care SMC MENTAL HEALTH AS SESSMENT AND REFERRA L TEAM (SMART) The SMART team are specially trained paramedics that are a part of the American Medical Response west. They are trained to respond to law enforcement Code 2EMS which are requests for individuals having a behavioral health emergency. The SMART paramedic performs the mental health assessment, places a 51 50 hold if needed and transports the client to Psychiatric Emergency Services, or if they do not meet criteria another community resource such as a crisis residential facility, doctor's office, detox, shelter, home etc . This ensures increased connectivity and treatment for community members. Additionally, many individuals are more likely to be forthcoming with a psychologically trained medi c about what they are experiencing as compared to law enforcement. This resource can only be accessed through the County's 911 system. In 16/17 620 clients were referred for co -occurring case management. They were referred directly from their PCP and assessed by an interface IMAT case manager As a result of this service clients were able to reduce or abstain from the use of substances, r econnect with family, secure housing, or employment, and reduce symptoms of anxiety In 16/17, 21 SMI clients were transferred to BHRS regional clinics METHODS SMART is a promising practice that provides the SMC community with an alternative to law enforcement and having to go to the hospital for an assessment. PROGRAM STRATEGIES PROGRAM HIGHLIGHTS DEMOGRAPHIC DATA The SMART program did not report demographic data for FY 16/17 and 17/18. The demographic data that is collected is inputted into a database that is not readily accessible. OUTCOMES 5,491 community members served AMR has successfully diverted 37.5% of calls, were a 5150 was not placed, the goal was to divert at least 10% of calls. SMART has successfully responded to many people under 18, who are in crisis and the team is able to address the youth's concerns, provide supportive services and directly involve the parents SMART is continuing to work and train law enforcement to wait before they place a 5150 hold. Create Access to Linkage and Treatment POSSIBLE OUTCOME MET RICS Reduce the number of hospitalizations Improve access to linkages to services Increase individual engagement in services/improve continuity of care SYSTEM TRANSFORMATIO N The SMART team continues to work alongside law enforcement and engages in training them when it comes to mental health emergencies.

SYSTEM TRANSFORMATIO N ODE is an integral part of BHRS in San Mateo County, it is the driver for many system transformation initiatives including the Government Alliance on Race and Equity which is an initiative that currently carried out within the Health System but is being e xpanded to all other county departments. Additionally, ODE is also tasked with leading the Multi -Cultural Organizational Development process which is internal to BHRS. MHSA being housed under ODE has allowed administrators to consider all funding through a n equity lens, and this affects the way we conduct our needs assessments, hours of operation and events, co -location of services, as well as thoughtful inclusion of clients and families in decision making processes.
