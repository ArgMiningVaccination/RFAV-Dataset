Lazaridis - Baylor College of Medicine, Neurology/ Neurocritical Care, Houston, TX, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A391 Introduction In addition to systemic hemodynamics, the management of neurocritically ill patients is often informed by neuromonitoring. In the absence of high-level evidence clinicians are often guided by per- sonal and local expertise. Little is known about practices as they pertain to the use of such monitoring in patients with acute brain injury (ABI). Objectives To investigate practices in bedside monitoring for ABI pa- tients. Particularly interested in differences among \"neurointensivists \" (NIs; defined here as intensivists whose clinical practice is com- prised > 1/3 by neurocritical care) and other intensivists (OIs). Also, to explore patterns specific to traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subarach- noid hemorrhage (SAH), as well as preferences and availability of particular technologies/devices. Methods Electronic survey of 22 items including two case-based sce- narios; endorsed by SCCM (9,000 recipients) and ESICM (on-line newsletter) in 2013. A sample size of 370 was calculated based on a population of 10,000 physician members, a 5 % margin error, and 95 % confidence interval. We summarized results using descriptive statistics (proportions with 95 % confidence intervals). A chi-square test was used to compare proportions of responses between NIs and OIs with a significance p < 0.05. Results There were 655 responders (66 % completion rate); 422(65 %) were classified as OIs and 226(35 %) as NIs. More NIs follow hemodynamic protocols for neurocritically-ill patients (56 % vs. 43 %, p 0.001), in TBI (44.5 % vs. 33.3 %, p 0.007), and in SAH (38.1 % vs. 21.3 %, p < 000.1). For delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI), more NIs target cardiac index (CI) (35 % vs. 21 %, p 0.0001), and fluid responsiveness (62 % vs. 53 %, p 0.03), use more bedside ultrasound (BUS) (42 % vs. 29 %, p 0.005) and arterial waveform analysis (40 % vs. 29 %, p 0.02). For DCI neuromonitoring, NIs use more angiography (57 % vs. 43 %, p 0.004), TCD (46 % vs. 38 %, p 0.0001), and CTP (32 % vs.16 %, p 0.0001). For CPP optimization in TBI, NIs use more arterial waveform analysis (45 % vs. 35 %, p 0.019), and BUS (37 % vs. 27.7 %, p 0.023), while more OIs monitor mixed venous oxygen saturation (54.1 % vs. 45 %, p 0.045). For TBI neuromonitoring, NIs use more PbtO 2(28 % vs. 10 %, p 0.0001). In the case scenario of raised ICP/low PbtO 2, most employ analgosedation (47 %) and osmotherapy (38 %). Fewer make use of preserved pressure reactivity, particularly OIs (vasopressor use 23 % vs. 34 %, p 0.014).Conclusions There is large heterogeneity in the use of monitoring pro- tocols, variables, and technologies/devices. \"Neurointensivists \"not only employ more neuromonitoring but also more hemodynamic monitor- ing in patients with acute brain injury. ICP/CPP remain the most com- monly followed neuro-variables in TBI patients, with low use of other brain-physiology parameters, suggesting that clinicians make limited efforts to individualize these goals. A392 A prospective observational pilot study of cerebral autoregulation measured by near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients with septic shock M. Hospitalier R\u00e9gional Orl\u00e9ans, 4(Suppl 1): A392 Introduction Impairment of cerebral autoregulation has been pro- posed as a possible explanation of cognitive dysfunction in patients with septic shock. Although transcranial Doppler has previously been used to assess cerebral autoregulation, this technology can only evalu- ate at single points in time. In contrast, near-infrared spectroscopy offers continuous assessment of cerebral autoregulation. Objectives Assess cerebral autoregulation using NIRS in patients admitted to the intensive care unit with septic shock. Methods We included 20 patients admitted with septic shock admit- ted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at Vancouver General Hospital (VGH). The ICU is a 31-bed mixed medical-surgical unit affiliated with the University of British Columbia. We excluded patients with acute or chronic neurological disorders, end stage liver disease, long-term dialysis, and those admitted following a cardiac arrest. We measured regional cerebral oximetry (rSO2) by NIRS (INVOS\u00ae, Covidien, Ireland) for 24 hours. NIRS and mean arterial pressure (MAP) data were collected in real time using ICM + \u00ae brain monitoring software ( C a m b r i d g eU n i v e r s i t y ,U K ) .I C M +c a l c u l a t e sam o v i n gP e a r s o n correlation coefficient (COx) between 30 consecutive, 10 second average MAP and rSO2 values. Impaired cerebral autoregulation was defined as a COx greater than 0.3. We also defined the im- paired autoregulation index (IARi ndex) as the percentage of moni- toring time spent with an impaired autoregulation. The IARindex was calculated for each 6 hours period (H 0H6;H 6H12;H12H18, H18H24), and for 24 hours. Results We analyzed 19 patients, one patient being excluded from analysis due to removal for arterial line [mean (Standard deviation); median (interquartile)] age 67(12), -75] median rSO2 64 [57 -70] %, median end tidalIntensive Care Medicine Experimental About this supplement These abstracts have been published as part of Intensive Care Medicine Experimental Volume 4 Suppl 1, 2016.

After removal of artefacts, the mean monitoring time was 22 h08 (8 h54). All patients had impaired cerebral autoregulation during their monitoring time. The mean IAR index was 17 (9.5) %. During H 0H6and H 18H24, the majority of our patients; respectively 53 and 71 % had an IAR index > 10 %. Conclusion According to our data, patients with septic shock had im- paired cerebral autoregulation within the first 24 hours of their ad- mission in the ICU. In our patients, we described a variability of distribution of impaired autoregulation according to time. References Schramm P, Klein KU, Falkenberg L, et al.

Chapple - University of Adelaide, Discipline of Acute Care Medicine, Adelaide, Australia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A393 Introduction Patients with a traumatic brain injury (TBI) remain in hospital for extended periods. It is likely that muscle mass in these patients diminishes over the hospital admission, yet this has not previ- ously been quantified. Ultrasonography may provide a useful measure of changes in muscle size over the hospital stay. Objectives To quantify changes in ultrasound-derived quadriceps muscle layer thickness (QMLT) and establish the feasibility of repeated ultrasound examinations throughout the entire hospitalisation of pa- tients with a TBI. Methods Adult patients with a moderate-severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale 3 -12) consecutively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) at a single trauma referral centre over 12 months were eligible follow- ing informed consent. Ultrasounds of QMLT at the midpoint and two-thirds between the anterior superior iliac spine and top of the patella were conducted weekly during admission. Data were cen- sored at 3-months and are mean (SD) unless otherwise stated. Results Thirty-three patients [45.4 (16.6) years; 88 % male; 55 % severe TBI; Trauma Injury Severity Score 0.5 (0.3); median APACHE II18 (IQR: 14 -22); admission body mass index 27.2 (6.5) kg/m2] were studied. Primary injury cause was vehicular (58 %) and 67 % of TBIs were multi-trauma. Median length of ICU and ward-based stay was 13.4 [IQR: 6.5-17.9] and 31.8 [9.4-52.4] days, respectively. At 3-months all patients were alive and four remained in hospital. A total of 123 ultrasounds were taken; 30 (24 %) in ICU and 93 (76 %) on the acute ward, equal to 3.7 ultrasounds per patient. Ultrasounds were not pos- sible at 21 % of time-points in hospital due to patient agitation and 61 % at 3-month follow-up due to inability to attend appointment in person. Twenty-eight (85 %) patients had >1 ultrasound taken during their admission, for which the mean baseline measure was 1.78 (0.72) cm and within patient standard deviation 0.3 cm. Nineteen pa- tients (58 %) had >2 ultrasounds during the hospital admission with a baseline measure of 1.78 (0.68) and proximate measure to dis- charge of 1.53 (0.52) cm. There was a 6.2 (35.8) % decrease between the baseline and proximate discharge measures. QMLT decreased over the first four weeks of hospital admission [week 1 (n = 22): 2.01 (0.84), week 2 (n = 24): 1.66 (0.59), week 3 (n = 19): 1.50 (0.57), week 4 (n = 13): 1.40 (0.38)]. At 3-months the QMLT was 2.00 (0.7) cm (n = 22), with a decrease from baseline of 3.2 (26.0) %. Conclusions This is the first study to describe longitudinal change in muscle size over the hospital admission in patients with a moderate- severe TBI. Whilst technically feasible, issues with compliance and missing data and intra-individual variation between measurements are challenges when conducting regular ultrasound measures in this population. Muscle thickness reduced throughout hospitalisation, but improved towards baseline by 3-months. A394 Acute impairment of saccadic eye movement is associated with cerebral infarction after aneurysmal Clinical Neurosciences, Oxford, UK;2Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit, Oxford, UK Correspondence: M.J. Rowland - Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Neurosciences Intensive Care Unit, Oxford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A394 Introduction Cerebral infarction due to delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI) remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality following aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). Damage to the brain in the first 72 hours ( \"early brain injury \") is likely to play a key patho- physiological role but remains difficult to quantify objectively and non- invasively at the bedside- especially in those patients who do not require sedation or ventilation. Current diagnostic modalities used in routine clinical practice are either invasive, require ionising radiation or contrast or have a high learning curve and user variability. Objectives We sought to determine whether saccadic eye movements are impaired following SAH and whether measurement of saccadic la- tency (SL) in the acute period post-aneurysm rupture is associated with the likelihood of developing DCI in patients after SAH. Methods 24 male/female patients (mean age 53.32, range 31 -70) with World Federation of Neurosurgeons (WFNS) grade I and II aneurysmal SAH, treated endovascularly within 72 hours of rupture were recruited. DCI and DCI-related cerebral infarction were defined as per consensus guidelines.1Saccadometry data was collected at three time points: in the first 72 hours, between days 5 and 10 and at three months post-SAH. Data from 10 healthy age/gender matched controls was collected on one occasion for comparison. Results Age-adjusted median SL in patients was significantly pro- longed in the first 72 hours post-SAH when compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 160.7, 95 % CI = (145.6, 179.4)ms, p = 0.0054 t-test). By 3 months post-SAH, there was no significant difference in median SL compared to controls (188.7, 95 % CI = (176.9, 202.2)ms v 180.0, 95 % CI = (165.1, 197.8)ms, p = 0.4175 t-test). Patients diagnosed with cerebral infarction due to DCI had a significantly higher age-adjusted median SL in the first 72 hours than those without infarction (240.6, 95 % CI = (216.7, 270.3)ms v 204.1, 95 % Fig. 1 (abstract 392). IAR index by 6 hours periodIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 206 of 607CI = (190.7, 219.5)ms, p = 0.0157 t-test). This difference was more pro- nounced during days 5 -10 post-SAH - the peak incidence for DCI (303.7, 95 % CI = (266.7 352.7)ms 0.0001 t-test). A binary generalised linear model showed that median SL in the first 72 hours was the only significant predictor of cerebral in- farction after SAH. Conclusions This is the first study to use saccadometry to measure eye movements in patients with SAH during the acute period post-rupture.Results show that median saccadic latency in the first 72 hours follow- ing SAH is an independent predictor of the risk of developing cerebral infarction due to DCI. Saccadometry may act as a potential objectivebiomarker of early brain injury to guide the need for intensive careadmission and treatment. References 1.

A395 The incidence of spreading depolarisations in non-invasive near-infrared London, UK; 2King's College London, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, Department of Clinical Neuroscience, London, UKCorrespondence: G. Fatania - King's College Hospital, Department of Neurosurgery, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A395 Introduction Spreading depolarisations (SD) occur spontaneously in is- chaemic cortex and are implicated in the evolution of the ischaemic penumbra. Subsequent enlargement of the ischaemic lesion causes worse neurological outcomes. Monitoring for SDs is solely performedthrough invasive electrocorticography (ECoG) which is located when apatient requires emergency surgery. SDs can cause significant haemo- dynamic changes which may be amenable to non-invasive monitoring. Objectives This study seeks to develop such a technique using near- infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). NIRS allows surrogate measure of cerebralblood flow by inferring changes in the concentration of oxyhaemoglo- bin and deoxyhaemoglobin. Methods 5 ischaemic brain injury patients requiring emergency neurosurgery (4 retrospective, 1 prospective) recruited to the COSBIDstudy at King's College Hospital (and monitored with ECoG) under- went concomitant NIRS monitoring. The NIRS data was analysed for significant haemodynamic response to SDs.Results In total, three ECoG-confirmed SDs occurred during NIRS monitoring, each in a different patient. Two acute (one minute) hypo- perfusion responses were seen after an SD in one patient. One acute (one minute) hyperperfusion response was seen after an SD in one pa-tient. Three subacute (20 minute) hypoperfusion responses were seenacross two patients. Conclusion This preliminary data is promising that NIRS can be used to assess the haemodynamic responses secondary to SDs. More datais required so that the responses can be characterised adequatelywhich could lead to a novel non-invasive monitoring technique. A396 Predicting intracranial pressure and brain tissue oxygen crises inpatients with severe traumatic brain injury R.B. Medicine, Neurology, Neurocritical Care, College of Medicine, Neurosurgery, TX, USA;4Baylor College Medicine, Pediatric Cardiology, Houston, TX, USA C. Lazaridis - Baylor College of Medicine, Neurology, Neurocritical Care, Houston, TX, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A396Introduction Two central physiologic targets in the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) are the intracranial pressure (ICP) and the partial brain tissue oxygen tension (PbtO 2). Intracranial pres- sure and PbtO 2thresholds are incorporated into step-tiered clinical protocols and guidelines however by the time treatment is provided, it may be too late. The ability to predict the onset of these \"crisis \" events would potentially provide clinicians with valuable time toattempt aborting the episode and/or to appropriately manage it.Combining statistical machine learning with physiologic and clinical insight allows the construction of robust quantitative models to pre- dict future events such as elevated ICP or low PbtO 2.Such models provide targets for evidence-based individualized treatment in realtime. Objectives Develop computer algorithms that can recognize physio- logic patterns in TBI patients that occur in advance of intracranialpressure ICP and PbtO 2crises. The automated early detection of crisis precursors can provide clinicians with time to intervene in order to prevent or mitigate secondary brain injury. Methods A retrospective study was conducted from prospectively collected physiologic data. Intracranial pressure and PbtO 2crisis events were defined as ICP 20 mmHg lasting at least 15 minutes and PbtO 2values < 10 mmHg for at least 10 minutes, respectively. The physiologic data preceding each crisis event were used to iden-tify precursors associated with crisis onset. Multivariate classificationmodels were applied to recorded data in 30-minute epochs of time to predict crises between 15 and 360 minutes in the future. Our cohort consisted of 817 severe TBI subjects admitted to the neuro-surgical intensive care unit of Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston,Texas. Results Our algorithm can predict the onset of an ICP crisis with 30 minutes advance warning and an AUC of 0.86 using only ICP mea-surements and time since last crisis. An analogous algorithm can pre-dict the start of PbtO 2crises with 30 minutes advanced warning and an AUC of 0.91. Conclusions We report here novel algorithms that provide accurate and timely predictions of intracranial hypertension and tissue hyp-oxia crises in patients with severe TBI. Almost all of the information needed to predict the onset of these events is contained within the signal of interest and the time since last crisis. These predictive algo-rithms offer clinicians the opportunity to prepare and potentially pre-vent secondary brain injury insults.

We recently showed that evolution of theEEG pattern within the first 24 hours after cardiac arrest robustly con-tributes to multimodal prediction of either poor or good outcome [1]. Objectives We aim to confirm our results and present a cost- effectiveness analysis.Methods 432 consecutive comatose patients after cardiac arrest were included in a prospective cohort study on two intensive care units.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 207 of 607Continuous EEG was measured during the first three days. EEGs were visually classified as unfavorable (isoelectric, low-voltage, burst-suppression-with-identical- bursts), intermediate, or favorable (continuous patterns), at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours by two reviewers,independently. Outcome was dichotomized as good (CPC score 1 or 2) or poor (CPC score 3, 4, or 5) at six months. EEG parameters were related to outcome using logistic regression analysis. Cost-effectiveness in the hospital is currently estimated by decision treeanalysis. Results Poor outcome occurred 54 % of included patients. Single parameters unequivocally predicting poor outcome in the first 277patients were an unfavorable EEG pattern at 24 hours, absentpupillary light responses at 48 hours, and absent SSEPs at 72 hours. Together, these had a specificity of 100 % and a sensitivity of 50 %. Favorable EEG patterns at 12 hours were strongly associated withgood outcome. EEG beyond 24 hours had no additional predictivevalue. For the remaining 155 patients, EEG analyses are ongoing. Data on cost-effectiveness, based on the assumption of EEG based treatment discontinuation, will be presented.Conclusions EEG within 24 hours is a robust contributor to prediction of poor or good outcome and should be included in guidelines for treatment of comatose patients after cardiac arrest.

Carteron - CHUV, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Neuroscience Critical Care Research Group, Lausanne, Switzerland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A398 Introduction Mechanisms of early brain injury (EBI) following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) are poorly understood. (pCT) and cerebral microdialysis (CMD), weexamined the relationship of cerebral energy metabolism with brainperfusion during the EBI phase after SAH in humans. Methods Prospective observational cohort of poor-grade SAH pa- tients monitored with cerebral microdialysis (CMD) who were resusci-tated according to current guidelines. Data from brain pCT(performed 44 \u00b1 25 hrs from ictus) were matched to CMD epochs dis- playing cerebral energy dysfunction, defined by a CMD lactate/pyru- vate ratio > 40 and/or lactate > 4 mmol/L.Results A total of 19 pCT and 127 hours of CMD samples (15 pa- tients) were analyzed. The majority (14/19) of pCT were associated with cerebral energy dysfunction, despite main cerebral physiologic variables were within normal range (intracranial pressure 14.2 \u00b17.2 mmHg, PbtO 225 \u00b1 10 mmHg). Energy dysfunction was associated with simultaneous normal (n = 9; 28 -65 mL/100 g/min) or hyperemic 69 -85 mL/100 g/min). Energy dysfunction also correlated with concomitant pathological elevations of glutam-ate and glycerol, that were more pronounced in hyperemic than nor-mal pCT (LPR 54 \u00b1 12 vs. 42 p= 0.18, t-test for comparisons between groups). Conclusions EBI after SAH is associated with profound cerebral metabolic and cellular distress, despite normal-hyperemic brain perfusion. Our findings reveal alternative pathophysiological mechanisms to ischemia in the EBI phase of SAH in humans andsupport therapeutic strategies targeted to energy dysfunction inthis setting.GRANTS Supported by research grants from the Swiss National Science Foun- dation (SNSF), the Novartis Foundation A399 Optic nerve sheath diameter evaluated by transorbital sonographyin healthy volunteers from PakistanM.A. Ali Aga Khan University Hospital, Anaesthesiology, Karachi, Pakistan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A399 Introduction Raised intracranial pressure is a common manifestation of severe brain injury. Rapid diagnosis and timely intervention is required to prevent secondary brain damage and death.An accurate, reliable,noninvasive, point-of-care monitoring device to identify presence ofintracranial hypertension would be helpful in situations where there is clinical suspicion for intracranial hypertension. Bedside ocular ultra- sound is an emerging noninvasive technique to measure optic nervesheath diameter. Knowledge of the normal range of optic nerve sheathdiameter in a healthy population is essential to interpret this measure- ment as a marker of raised intracranial pressure in clinical practice. Objectives To evaluate normal optic nerve sheath diameter in healthy volunteers in Pakistan.Methods Hundred healthy volunteers of Pakistani origin, aged more than 18 years were recruited in the study. The ultrasound probe was placed on the superior and lateral aspect of the orbit against theupper eyelid with the eye closed. For each subject, the primary inves-tigator performed three measurements on each eye. The measure- ments of each eye were then averaged to yield a mean optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD). Results are presented as mean \u00b1 standarddeviation (SD). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS softwareversion 19. Mann Whitney Utest was used to compare unpaired variables between genders and Wilcoxon matched pairs signed rank test to compare left and right eyes.Results The median ONSD of right eye was 4.84 mm and 95 % of individuals had mean ONSD in the range 4.84-4.97 mm while the median ONSD of left eye was 4.86 mm and 95 % of individuals had mean ONSD in the range 4.85-4.96 mm. There was no differenceamong the 3 repeated measures of ONSD in each eye. There was norelationship between ONSD with age, gender and measurement taken between left and right eyes. Conclusions 95 % of healthy Pakistani adults have an ONSD less than 4.82 mm. ONSD more than 4.82 mm in this population should beconsidered abnormal and may reflect raised intracranial pressure.

Dias1,2, Portugal - Faculty of Medicine, University of Porto, Medicine, Porto, Portugal Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A400 Introduction Autonomic control and cerebral autoregulation (CAR) may be disturbed after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and become severely im- paired due to intracranial hypertension (IH). Decompressive craniectomy (DC) after TBI is a tiered therapy for patients with IH, but the links be- tween autonomic derangement, intracranial pressure (ICP), impaired cerebral autoregulation and outcome remain poorly explored. Objectives We aimed to evaluate the relationship between heart rate variability (HRV), as a surrogate of autonomic control, ICP and CAR before and after DC. Methods We retrospectively studied 9 adult TBI patients, admitted to the Neurocritical Care Unit at Hospital S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Porto that were sub- mitted to primary or secondary DC and had completed monitoring records 12 h before and 24 h after surgery. Patients were monitored with continuous ECG, ICP, cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral auto- regulation with pressure reactivity and pressure-volume compensa- tory reserve index (RAP). Automatic delineation of ECG signal was performed using a wavelet-based approach and HRV analysis in time and frequency domain was done according to the guidelines for both periods selected. Results A total of 48 consecutive TBI patients submitted to DC were screened, but we had to exclude 39 patients because of incomplete monitoring data. The median age was 27 (IQR13), 7 were men, me- dian GCS was 6 (IQR3), median GOS was 4 (IQR2) and hospital mor- tality was 22 %. DC led to a significantly decrease in ICP maximum value (p = 0.011), CPP (p = 0.038) and RAP (p = 0.008) after surgery. There were no significant differences between values of PRx and HRV variables both in time and frequency domain. However, we found statistically significant correlations between HRV nonparametric variables and multimodal brain monitoring variables (Fig. 2). Before DC normalized low frequency (LFn), high frequency (HFn) and LF/HF ratio are positively correlated ICP value, ively 0.3,p = 0.005;Rs = 0.4,p = 0.0001). After DC the correlation becomes negative but non-significant. Total power (Tp) has a positive and significant correlation with CPP before DC (Rs = 0.5,p = 0.000). RAP is negatively correlated with Tp and HF after DC (Rs = 0.4,p = 0.000;Rs = 0.5,p = 0.000). PRx increases after DC and we could not find any important correlation with HRV. Conclusions Further studies are warranted to better understand the brain changes and autonomic distress associated with high intracra- nial pressure and decompressive craniectomy. References 1.

Monitoring time frame analysis before and after DCIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 209 of 607Methods: 40 patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury(GCS 13) admitted to a university teaching hospital were en- rolled. ONSD and TCD measurements were performed daily for 7 days. TCD was performed on both middle cerebral arteries(MCA), recording peak systolic (sFV), end Marshall CT neuroimaging scales were recorded on admis- sion, 48 hours and 5 to 7 days later. Glasgow Outcome Scale(GOS)- was assessed six months after discharge for survivors. Results: The PI significantly increased in days 2 and 3 then it showed a non-significant decrease in day 4 and 5, all compared to baseline value. This was followed by a significant decrease in days 6 and 7. Comparing the PI's daily reading with the previous day was significant, increasing from day 1 to day 2, and from day 2 to day 3 then decreasing from day 3 till day 7(p < 0.001). The PI showed a significant direct correlation the Marshall and Rotterdam Scales on days 3 and 7, and Rotterdam Scale on day 7. A significant direct correlation was demonstrated between the ICU LOS and the PI determined on days 4 to7. No significant correlation was found between the mean ONSD and the PI measured on days 1 to 5, but a significant direct correlation was demonstrated between the two parameters on day 6 and day 7. The sFV, dFV and mFV were signifi- cantly higher on days 2 to 4 in survivors than in non-survivors. While the PI on day 2 and 3 was significantly lower in survivors than in non-survivors. On day 2, a mFV of 27.31 cm/sec was 94.44 % accurate in detecting non-survivors. On day 3, a mFV of 6.62 cm/sec was 100 % accurate in detecting non-survivors. On day 2, a PI of >1.26 was 89.47 % accurate in detecting non- survivors. On day 3, a PI of >1.87 was 100 % accurate in detecting non-survivors. Conclusions: There was a significant da y-to-day changes in the ONSD and PI in TBI patients making serial estimation of clinically/ radiologically diagnosed raise d ICP possible in the absence of invasive ICP measurement.The correlation between PI and CT imaging of the head together with its cost-effectiveness, safety to the patient and permanent availability makes the sonographic approach highly beneficial. TCD derived parameters predicted survival in TBI patients.TCD derived PI correlated directly with ICU length of stay.

Among the possible complications, central nervous system (CNS) events, such as stroke or hemorrhage, are associated with long-term neurologic morbidity and increased mortality. Additionally, peripheral VA-ECMO can result in delivery of hypoxic blood to the brain. The use of cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can detect cerebral hypoperfusion non-invasively.

Sensors were placed on the patients\u00b4 foreheads using the Foresight device (CAS Medical Systems, Inc, Branford, USA). Regional saturation (rSO2) was recorded and analysed by calculating the time below different thresholds (60 %, 55 % and 50 %). Results: A total of 39 patients (age: 54 [48 -7 2 ]y e a r s )h a dc e r e b r a l NIRS monitoring during VA-ECMO for cardiogenic shock (n = 19), refractory cardiac arrest (n = 14) and post heart/lung transplant- ation (n = 6). ECMO was applied for 6 [3 -10] days and NIRS monitoring for 3 [2 -4] days. Nine (23 %) patients developed an is- chemic stroke (8/9 in the anterior circulation) and 6 (15 %) differ- e n t i a lh y p o x i a- l o w e rP a O 2i nt h eu p p e rb o d yt h a ni nt h el o w e r body, because of normal cardiac output with severe impairment of pulmonary function- during the first 3 days of monitoring. Hospital mortality was 22/39 (56 %). Twenty-seven (69 %) patients had a drop of rSO2 < 60 % for at least 5 % of the NIRS monitoring period, resulting in hemodynamic interven tions, which involved increasing pressure, oxygenation, and/or ECMO flow. In the 3/6 patients with differential hypoxia, these interventions were unsuccessful and a veno-arterial-venous ECMO was implemented. Patients developing ischemic 0.004) than others. Survivors had a shorter rSO2 time < 60 % than non-survivors (6.6[1.2-24.5]% vs. 43 [12 -60]%; p = 0.007). Conclusions: Cerebral NIRS monitoring may be helpful in patients undergoing VA-ECMO to detect cerebrovascular events or brain hypoperfusion/reduced oxygen delivery. In these patients cerebral hypoperfusion is associated with a poor outcome. A403 Cerebral regional tissue oxygenation in patients with neurocardiac injury after subarachnoid 1University of Pittsburgh, School of Nursing; Department of Acute & Tertiary Care, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PA, USA;2University of Pittsburgh, School of Medicine: Department of Neurosurgery, Pittsburgh, PA, USA Correspondence: M. Hravnak - University of Pittsburgh, School of Nursing; Department of Acute & Tertiary Care, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, PA, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A403 Introduction: Although it has been demonstrated previously that patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) may also experience neurocardiac injury, the impact of this complication on cerebral and peripheral tissue perfusion is not well understood. Objectives: We aimed to determine if neurocardiac injury as defined by increased levels of cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was associated with changes in regional cerebral (CrSO 2) and peripheral (PrSO 2) tissue oxygen saturation as measured with continuous near-infrared spec- troscopy (NIRS) across days 1 -3 after aSAH. Methods: Longitudinal prospective analysis of 13 patients with aSAH. Inclusion criteria: age 21 -75 years, spontaneous aneurysm rupture, Fisher grade >1 and/or Hunt and Hess grade >2, and with NIRS data. Exclusion: traumatic SAH, and recent myocardial dysfunction. cTnI was measured at least daily. Continuous non-invasive CrSO 2and PrSO 2commenced immediately following study enrollment. CrSO 2 was acquired utilizing two separate sensors affixed to the left and right forehead, while PrSO 2was obtained utilizing a single sensor at- tached to either the left or right thenar eminence. Continuous CrSO 2 and PrSO 2values were recorded every 5 milliseconds and then aver- aged on hourly intervals for statistical analyses. The daily peak values of cTnI were used in the analysis as a time-varying variable. The hourly averaged CrSO 2and PrSO 2values were also treated as time varying variables. Generalized estimating equation (GEE) was used toevaluate the association between cTnI and both right and left CrSO2, as well as PrSO 2, where cTnI was used as the independent variable and CrSO 2/PrSO 2as dependent variables, while controlling for age and gender. Results: The 13 patients in the analysis had a mean age of 56.6 years, SD = 8.9, and were predominantly female (85 %). The GEE modeling revealed that higher peak cTnI was significantly associated with lower PrSO 2and higher left-sided CrSO 2. Higher cTnI was ated with a trend toward lower CrSO 2on the right side, but that was not statistically significant (Fig. 7). Conclusions: Neurocardiac injury after aSAH as defined by higher levels of cTnI is associated with impaired peripheral perfusion, but its impact on cerebral perfusion is variable. Further investigation in a lar- ger sample is needed to see if site of the aneurysm, cerebral vascular autoregulation, or vasospasm may play a role.

Abdelmonem - University of Alexandria, Criticalcare, Alexandria, Egypt Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A404 Introduction: Stroke is a major health problem including both ische- mic and hemorrhagic types. Although a long-recognized clinical phenomenon, there remain many questions regarding the epidemi- ology of seizures and epilepsy after ischemic stroke, their effect on outcome, and their treatment [1]. Objectives: This pilot study assesses the incidence of seizures in acute ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Methods: The study was carried out on all patients presented within the first 24 of ischemic cerebrovascular stroke admitted to the units of Critical Care Medicine, Alexandria Main University Hospital, during a period of 6 months. EEG was performed in the first 24 of presenta- tion, at the end of the first and second week of admission and if the level of consciousness deteriorated at any time during the acute phase of cerebral infarction and not explained by CT findings or any metabolic derangement. Fig. 7 (abstract A403).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 211 of 607Results: Among all the study group, the incidence of overall seizures was 20 %, of them, incidence of non-convulsive seizures were 13.3 % compared to 6.6 % of the patients showed convulsive seizures. Mostseizures occurred on the first 24 hours of ischemia (66.7 %) com-pared to those occurring at the end of first week (25 %) and those at the end of the second week (8.3 %). Conclusions: Ischemic stroke is considered as a risk factor for the de- velopment of seizures and status epilepticus both convulsive andnon-convulsive types especially during the first twenty-four hours.

Puig - University of Geneva, Department of Microbiology and Molecular Medicine (MIMOL), Geneva, Switzerland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A405 Introduction: Sepsis is associated with immune suppression, includ- ing depressed cellular immunity. A decrease in surveillance byimmune cells could be one of the mechanisms explaining thegrowing perception that patients surviving sepsis are at increased risk of developing cancers. However, other mechanisms may be involved in this increased rate of tumors in sepsis survivors, involv-ing humoral factors. Sepsis is also associated with marked up- ordown-regulation of various soluble mediators affecting cell growth. We hypothesized that some of th ese mediators may promote the proliferation of tumors.Objective: To identify and isolate this (those) plasma factor(s) enhancing tumor cell growth. Methods: Heparinized human blood samples were collected from patients with septic shock and in healthy donors. Human adenocar-cinoma epithelial cells from lung (A549), colon (SW620), breast(Hs578T), and liver (HepG2) and human monocytic leukemia cells (THP-1 and HL-60) were grown to 70 % confluence and incubated with 5 - 15 % septic or healthy plasma, or control media. After24 hours, cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT Cell ProliferationAssay. Septic and healthy plasma fractionation was performed using classical biochemical techniques. Results: Septic plasma supported significantly higher epithelial cell proliferation than plasma from healthy subjects (+48 % in A549,+59 % in SW620, +41 % in Hs578T, and +29 % in HepG2 cells with 15 % plasma). Interestingly, this effect was not observed in tumoral cells of monocytic origin. Adding healthy plasma to septic plasmadecreased the tumor epithelial cell proliferation effect seen with sep-tic plasma alone in a dose-dependent manner. Initial plasma fraction- ation studies suggest that the proliferation factor(s) in septic plasma remains in an immunoglobulin- and albumin-free plasma fraction,is(are) not precipitable by 50 % ammonium sulfate, and is(are) atrypsin-sensitive protein(s) > 50 kDa.Conclusions: The identification of such plasma protein(s) affecting tumor cell growth could be of great interest in the fields of sepsis and cancer biology.Grant acknowledgmentUnrestricted research grant from Novartis Research Foundation (15B094). A406 Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) as an alternative to noninvasiveventilation (NIV) in acute respiratory failure (ARF) in immunosuppressed patients - an Indian post liver transplant experienceS. Gupta, D. Govil, S. Srinivasan, S.J. Patel, J.K. Gupta - Medanta - The Medicity, Gurgaon, India Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A406 Introduction: In immunocompromised patients, acute respiratory fail- ure (ARF) is associated with high mortality [1] and many studies haveconfirmed the utility of prolonged non invasive ventilation (NIV) insuch condition. Lately High Flow Nasal Cannula (HFNC) has been used in ARF in various patient subsets but not specifically in post transplant patients.Objectives: To compare HFNC vs NIV as the modality to manage ARF in postoperative hypoxemia in post liver transplant patients. Methods: This was a pilot study conducted in a Liver Transplant in- tensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital in India. We ran-domly assigned 20 consecutive post transplant patients whodeveloped respiratory failure in the post-operative period to either HFNC group (n = 10) or to NIV group (n = 10). The HFNC was initiated at a flow rate of 60 l/min whereas NIV was set at EPAP of 5 cm andIPAP at 10 cm. Both the device setting and oxygen titration wasdone according to arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. Apart from ABG analysis, we assessed the COMFORT scale as well as the RASS and CAM-ICU scale of the patient and also assessed the total nutritionaldeficit at the end of 48-hr therapy duration. The need for invasivemechanical ventilation (IMV) was also noted for both the groups. Results: None of the patients in the HFNC group required need for IMV whereas 2 patients in NIV group had to be intubated. Patients inthe HFNC group had better average PaO2 as compared to NIV (98.2vs 72.6 mm Hg) respectively. The patients in the NIV group received more sedation with dexmedetomidine as compared to HFNC group (22 vs 10 hrs) respectively. The patients in the HFNC group weremore comfortable as compared to NIV group and two patients in theNIV group developed delirium for which they required IMV. The aver- age RASS score was 0 to +1 in the HFNC group whereas it ranged from 2 to +2 in the NIV group. All patients were fed either orally or enterally but the NIV group consumed less feeding due to the inabil-ity to feed orally and apprehension of aspiration due to aerophagia when fed enterally. The NIV group received 52 % less calories as compared to HFNC group in 48-hr period.Conclusions: HFNC is may be an excellent armamentarium for man- aging hyperemic respiratory failure in immunocompromised patients with reduced risk of intubation, more comfortable to the patients and little interruption in providing adequate nutrition.

Methods: This one-center prospective study was conducted in the ICU of the University Hospital of Larissa, Greece. Consecutive critical care patients were recruited if they presented risk factors for IAH. Patients were evaluated systematically for IAH and VAP for a 28-day period. Results: Twenty-four out of 59 (41 %) patients presented IAH and 28 (47.4 %) presented VAP; seventeen (70.83 %) patients presented VAP following IAH. Multivariate showed that VAP [1.18(1.10-1.22) (p = 0.004)], COPD (p = the use of antacids [9.54(2.74-33.19) (p = 0.016)] were independently associated with IAP. Conclusion: IAH may have an adverse impact on the frequency of VAP in critically ill patients with risk factors for IAH. A408 Azithromycin modulates inflammatory response in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa severe infection I. Palacios Garcia, A. Diaz Martin, V. Sanchez Encinares, M. Pach\u00f3n Iba\u00f1ez, J. Garnacho - Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Sevilla, Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A408 Objectives: Macrolides, apart from its antibiotic properties, are able to modulate the inflammatory response: inhibit production and and inhibit secretion of nitric oxide (NO). Our working hypothesis is that the use of azithromycin (AZM) with ceftazidime (CFZ) in a mouse model of se- vere sepsis by P. aeruginosa , modulates the inflammatory response.Methods: lethal sepsis model mouse with a clinical P. aeruginosa strain (Pa4) is characterized. i) CFZ (dose 100 mg / kg / ip / 12 h), ii) AZM (30 mg / kg / ip / 24 h): To study the inflammatory response, the following treatment groups (n = 15) for 72 hours were performed iii) COMB: CFZ + AZM, iv) control of infected animals and untreated group (CON) and v) group of uninfected mice. TNF- determinations, IL-6, IL-10 and nitrite / nitrate (NOx) routine employed as a surrogate marker of NO metabolism in mouse plasma by ELISA (commercially available kits) ratio were performed. Results: We compare the TNF- , IL-10 and NOx plasma concentra- tions, in each group (4 and 8 hours post-treatment) related to those obtained in the CON group. The COMB (AZM + CFZ) group showed lower plasma concentrations concentrations of IL-10 (pg/ml) were higher in the COMB and AZM groups in the concentrations (M) observed were lower in the COMB group than in AZM and CFZ results suggest the immunomodulatory capability of AZM as an adjunct treatment to appropriate antibiotic. Further studies are needed to infer these findings to human setting. Grant acknowledgment This project (PI10/01563) was funded by the \"Health Research Fund\" Health Institute Carlos III.

Poulose - Changi General Hospital, Respiratory & Critical Care Medicine, Singapore, Singapore Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A409 Introduction: Intravenous glutamine can have beneficial effects on critically ill patients by preserving gut barrier and improving immune function. Objectives: We wanted to prove the benefit of intravenous glutam- ine in patients admitted to medical intensive care unit (MICU) with severe sepsis and receiving enteral nutrition. Methods: Randomized, single center, double -blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study on patients admitted to the MICU who met the criteria for severe sepsis. In the intervention arm, intravenous glutamine was given for 5 days at a dose of 0.5 g/kg body weight/day. All patients were fed enterally as per the MICU feeding protocol. The primary outcomes were 28-day mortality and the occurrence of new infections. We also looked at severity scores (SOFA), ICU length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS and duration of mechanical ventilation. Results: Thirty nine patients were randomized to receive glutamine (n = 19) or placebo (n = 20). The glutamine group had less disease se- verity than placebo (median SOFA score 8 versus 11, p =0.038) .There was no difference in 28-day mortality between the glutamine and placebo groups (42 % vs 15 %, p = 0.06). When adjusted for disease severity, the glutamine arm had 5.6 times higher death rates (95 % CI 1.1-30.2, p = 0.044). The glutamine group had lesser incidence of new infections (0 % vs 30 %, p = 0.02). There was no difference in ICU LOS, hospital LOS or the duration of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: Intravenous glutamine increases mortality risk in ICU patients with severe sepsis, although it reduces risk of new infections Grant acknowledgement SingHealth Foundation Research Grant Fig. 8 (abstract A406).

Yeter - Hacettepe University, Internal Medicine, Ankara, Turkey Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A410 Objective: Sepsis is characterized by dysregulated immune response to infection leading to organ dysfunction. Vitamin D plays a pivot role in the immune system and low levels of vitamin D have been shown tobe associated with worse outcome in septic patients. In this study wetested vitamin D levels sequentially and aimed to define the vitamin D response in septic shock. Methods: Between September 2014 and January 2016, 41patients with septic shock were included in the study. Patients were excluded if theyhad a disease affecting calcium and vitamin D metabolism such as ma- lignancy, chronic kidney disease, parathyroid disorders, pancreatitis, tumor lysis syndrome, rhabdomyolysis, renal tubular disorders andpregnancy. We measured vitamin D levels in day 1 and day 5after diag-nosis of septic shock. Results: The median (min-max) age of 41 patients was 67 (19 -88). 21of these patients were male. The median APACHE II score was 28(11 -45). Day 1 and day 5 median vitamin D levels were 6.8 ng/ml(1 -30) and 12 (2-29) ng/ml, respectively. Baseline c (0.80-1.22). 21of the 41 septic shock patients died within 28 day. The APACHE IIscores were similar between the survivor and non-survivor groups [27.5(11-40), 30 (11 -45), p = 0.13]. Baseline median corrected calcium and ion- ized calcium levels of survivors vs. vs. 1.10 mmol/L (0.80-1.22). Day 1 median vitamin D levels of survivors and non-survivors were 8.7 ng/ml(4.3-30.4) and5.3 ng/ml (1.0-21.7), respectively(p = 0.047). Day 5 vitamin D levels were not statistically different between survivors and non-survivors (n = 17; 12.3 ng/ml and n = 7; 5.7 ng/ml, p =0.37).Vitamin D levels increased i n the survivor group from 8.7 ng/ml in day 1 to 12.4 ng/m lin day 5, however the difference was not statistically different (p = 0.18). Vitamin D levels did not change in the non-survivor group from day 1 to day 5 (5.3 ng/ml to 5.7 ng/ml, p = 0.89).Kaplan Meiersurvival analysis revealed that patients with vitamin D levels 6.8 ng/ml (median value) had increased 28-day survival as compared to patients with low vitamin D levels (<6.8 ng/ml) (long rank test p = 0.012). Conclusion: Our study showed that vitamin D response might be differ- ent between surviving and non-surv iving patients during the course of septic shock. Surviving patients had higher day 1vitamin D levels as compared to non-surviving patients. Increase in vitamin D level from day 1 to 5 suggests a clinically significa nt albeit statistica lly insignificant association of vitamin D and survival, in line with high vitamin D levelsin baseline comparisons of the groups, favoring survivors, due to the lim- ited sample size. Further studies in larger groups are clearly warranted. A411 Central line associated blood stream infections in the obese and overweight critically ill patients (preliminary data)I. Tsolakoglou Management, Thessaloniki, Greece,7University of Athens, Faculty of Nursing, Critical Care Directorate, Athens, Greece Correspondence: I. Tsolakoglou - General Hospital of Thessaloniki Agios Pavlos, ICU, Thessaloniki, Intensive Care 4(Suppl 1): A411Introduction: Central-Line-Associated Bloodstream Infections (CLABSI) have been studied extensively in ICU patients. There are no data in the literature regarding a potential association between obesity andCLABSI.Objectives: To test the hypothesis that CLABSI depends on the pres- ence of obesity in critically ill patients. Methods: We conducted an 18-month observational study on 576 critically ill patients, in three general ICUs in Greece. All patients hadinserted a triple-lumen catheter in a central vein (internal jugular, femoral or subclavian). Body Mass Index (BMI) was determined by a dietitian on ICU admission. BMI was categorized a priori as < 18.5(underweight), 18.5-24.9 (normal weight), 25 -29.9 (overweight), and >30 (obese). CLABSI was diagnosed by examining the catheter's tip and a blood sample. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the association between BMI groups and CLABSI.Results: From the 576 critically ill patients, (258 men, 318 women) mean aged 62.3 \u00b1 18.4 years, 28 (4.9 %) were underweight, 220 (38.2 %) normal weight, 234 (40.6 %) overweight and 94 (16.3 %) obese. CLABSI was diagnosed in 156 (27.1 %) patients. Overweightand obese patients had significant higher CLABSI rates than theother patients (p < 0.05). Obese patients had significantly less survival rates (p < 0.05). Patient's data according to the BMI category are shown on Table 1. Additional adjustment for obesity-central line catheter association for the presence of CLABSI attenuates the obes-ity- central line catheter association: underweight CLABSI OR = 1.79 (95 % CI 1.54-2.03; p = 0.006); normal weight CLABSI OR = 1.86 (95 % CI 1.80-1.93; p = 0.003); overweight CLABSI OR = 1.63 (95 % CI 1.54-1.72; p = 0.001); obese- CLABSI OR = 1.64 (95 % CI 1.50-1.78, p =0.001). Conclusions: Obesity appears to be associated with the presence of CLABSI in critically ill patients. This could be partially attributed tothe more efforts made by physicians to insert the catheter in theobese patients than the other patients.

Results: 11 patients were enrolled, vs 7 healthy volunteers (HV, Bl only). Compared to HV, in Bl, HLA-DR expression decreased in patients on MoCD16- (p < 0,05) with a higher ROS production (p < 0,05). HLA-DRexpression was higher on Mo CD16+. All LILR expressions signifi- cantly higher on Mo CD16-, Mo CD16+, PMNs, except for LILRB1, with a decrease in their ligand HLA-I (p < 0,05). On Gr CD16-, LILR B1 only wasincreased. Comparison between Bl and Pl showed no differencesexcept for LILRB3 expression being higher on PMNs with a higher HLA- DR expression on Mo CD16-. All LILR expressions decreased between T1 and T2 (p < 0,05) regardless the patients prognosis.Conclusions: The increased LILR expression in Bl myeloid cells during sepsis was similar in Pl cells, with a decrease along time without rela- tion with prognosis. LILR expression could be used both in Mo and PMNs in association with Bl Mo HLA-DR to characterize immunode-pression and the potential therapy for immunomodulation. References 1. Baudhuin J et al.

A413 The impact of red blood cell (RBC) transfusion on sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) levels of critically ill patients of Anaesthesiology, Hamburg, Germany;2University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Institute of Clinical Pharmacology and Toxicology, Hamburg, Germany;3University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Hamburg, GermanyCorrespondence: A. Poppe - University Medical Center Hamburg- Eppendorf, Department of Anaesthesiology, Hamburg, Germany Intensive 4(Suppl 1): A413 Introduction: Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a G-protein coupled signaling lipid. In particular S1P has been shown to reduce sepsis in- duced endothelial leakage and cytokine release from immune cellsand to regulate vascular tone.Among others these processes are responsible for the high mortality of critically ill patients. Therefore S1P has been studied in critically ill patients; lately low S1P concentrations have been associated withsepsis severity by our group [1].S1P is mainly released by haematopoietic cells such as erythrocytes (EC) and thrombocytes (TC) [2]. EC produce and secrete S1P continuously, whereas TC produce S1P but release S1P only upon activation [3].Objective: We were interested if S1P concentration in blood of critic- ally ill patients may be influenced by red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Methods: S1P concentration in serum and EDTA plasma of 28 critic- ally ill patients was measured before and after transfusion of oneRBC preservation at several times (pre and 30 min, 180 min, 24 h post). S1P was also measured in the transfused RBC preservation. Dif- ferences between transfusion of \"fresh \"(RBC15d) and \"old\"(RBC > 15d) RBC were analysed.Clinical data like SOFA scores, haemoglobin (HB) and haematocrit (Hct) values of all patients were monitored repeatedly. Results: S1P concentration was higher in RBC preservations com- pared to serum and plasma levels in patients (P < 0,05). Serum S1Plevels were higher compared to plasma S1P levels (p < 0,05), though serum and plasma levels correlated positively during time. S1P con- centration in plasma declined 30 min after transfusion (p < 0,05) andincreased to pre levels within 24 h. not change.Comparing \"fresh \"and \"RBC (P < 0,05). However in patients, blood S1P values did not differ if \"fresh \"or\"old\"RBCs have been transfused.Conclusions: RBC preservations contain high S1P com- pared patient\u00b4s endogenous S1P. S1P concentration in RBC preser- vations correlates negatively with duration of storage. Transfusion ofRBC influences plasma S1P negatively within 30 min. S1P declinesimmediately after transfusion and increases thereafter during the next 24 h. Serum S1P levels are not changed by RBC transfusion. However alteration of plasma S1P levels by RBC transfusion had noinfluence on the clinical outcome of our patients. References 1.

Objectives: To determine the \u00abat risk of mortality\u00bb profiles in A and P intensive care unit (ICU) patients in comparison to ICU-survivors and healthy (H) controls. To assess possible associations of heat shockproteins (HSP) and Resistin and Adiponectin hormone changes oroxygen consumption dioxide production (VCO2), energy ex- penditure (EE) and metabolic pattern alterations with mortality in the early phase of critical illness.Methods: Seventy-eight adults (S/22; SIRS/23; H/33) and 67 children (S/18; SIRS/23; H/26) mechanically ventilated were included in the study. Blood samples were obtained within 24-hours upon admission. Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) for HSP expression in monocytes(m) or neutrophils (n) was determined by Flow Cytometry. Restistin,Adiponectin and extracellular (e) HSP72 were measured using ELISA and energy-expenditure (EE) by E-COVX. Genomic DNA was extracted with PureLink Genomic DNA kit to detect HSP72 SNPs.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 215 of 607Results: More patients with septic shock (p < 0.005) or patients with lactate >2 mmol/L (p < 0.02) were recorded among non-survivors (A 12.7 % vs. P 7.4 %) compared to survivors. APACHEII, eHSP72, tropo-nin, and lactate levels were higher and VCO 2, EE, metabolic pat- tern, and albumin lower among non-survivors compared to survivors in both groups (p < 0.05). Also, non-survivors P had higher PELOD, Resistin, and anion gap and lower EF (p Ashowed trend for higher nHSP72, age groups, the rs6457452 and rs1061581 HSP72 haplotypes were not related to mortality. In a logistic regression model, high lac- tate in A and resistin levels in P were independently associated withmortality (p < 0.01). For predicting sepsis-3 in both groups, low VO 2, VCO 2, metabolic pattern, and albumin and high lactate levels achieved a receiver operating characteristic curve >0.7 (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Intensive care adult and pediatric patients at risk of mor- tality show similar inflammatory - immunity and metabolic profiles by the rs6457452 and rs1061581 HSP72 SNPs. High lactate levels and hypometabolism better predict mortality in both groups.

Objectives : Assess the prognostic value of serum immunoglobulins (Igs): IgG, IgA and IgM determined within 24 hours from severe sep-sis (SS) or septic shock (SSh) onset.Methods: A cohort study was performed in 133 critically ill adult pa- tients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Demographic vari- ables, severity score, mortality at 28 days were recorded, thosepatients who had been administered the first dose of intravenous im-munoglobulins were excluded. The Igs were determined by nephe- lometry, Dimension Vista.\u00ae Siemens. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 15.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).Results: Of the 133 patients enrolled in the study 16.5 % met SS criteria and 83.5 % SSh. The mean age was 62 [inter-quartile range (IR): 48.5- 70.5] years, 62.4 % were men. The main sources of infection were: respiratory tract 36.8 % and intra-abdomen 28.6 % The mediam stay inthe ICU was 6 [3.5-11] days and mortality at 28 days was 21.8 % (n =29). Median serum IgG Igs were 792 [607 to 976.5] mg / dl, IgA 204 [147.5 to 315] mg / dl, and IgM 76 [46.5 to 132] mg / dl. Patients who died had significantly higher levels of clinical severity with APACHE II29.8 vs 24.1, 8.9 vs 12.1 Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)and organ dysfunction number 4.6 vs 3.6 and in serum IgA: 323 vs 195 mg / dl. This difference was not statistically significant in levels of IgG 822 vs. 774 mg / dl or IgM 86 vs. 72.5 mg / dl.Conclusions: Serum levels of IgG, IgA and IgM were higher in pa- tients who died, but only IgA showed a prognostic value when was measured within 24 hours from SS or SSh onset.

Tavladaki - University of Crete, Medical School, University Hospital, PICU, Heraklion, Greece Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A416 Introduction: The new sepsis definition, known as Sepsis-3, shifted the diagnostic focus from infection with systemic inflammation to in- fection triggered organ failure, and it does away with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome criteria (SIRS). The role of cellularinnate immunity and inflammatory-metabolic abnormalities in S andSIRS development has not been clarified. Objectives: To examine early heat shock proteins (HSP) and Resistin and Adiponectin hormone changes, along with clinical, inflammatory,and metabolic profiles, in adult (A) and pediatric (P) intensive careunit (ICU) patients with sepsis (S). To compare the S profiles with those of SIRS or healthy-controls (H) in each group. Methods: H/26) mechanically ventilated were included in thestudy. Blood samples were obtained within 24-hours upon admission. Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI) for HSP expression in monocytes (m) or (n) determined 4-colour Flow Restistin, E-COVX for energy-expenditure (EE). Genomic DNA was extracted by using the PureLink Genomic DNA kit to detect the polymorphic HSP72 SNPs rs6457452.Results: EE, metabolic pattern, glucose, and albumin lower in S com- pared to SIRS and/or H (p < 0.05). Only PELOD and MAP in P and INR,nHSP72 and glucose in A differed among groups (p < 0.05). For pre-dicting sepsis-3 in both groups CRP, resistin, lactate, and eHSP72 in P, achieved a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) > 0.80 (p < 0.05). In a logistic regression model resistin and mHSP72 inde-pendently discriminated S from SIRS in children only (p < 0.001). In Aand P, genotype HSP72 analysis did not disclose any group ences regarding the rs6457452 or the rs1061581 haplotypes. Conclusions: Sepsis presents with repressed innate immunity and me- tabolism and enhanced inflammatory re sponse in adult and pediatric sep- tic patients. These changes may hel p in depicting a common for adults and children new sepsis-3 profile discriminated from the one of SIRS.

Delay in starting effective antimicrobiological treatment incase of infections is associated with worse outcome. It is imperativeto diagnose the presence of infectious complications after LT in a timely fashion. Biomarkers have been proposed as a tool to improve early diagnosis of infections in this population.Objectives: To determine how sequential measurements of PCT and CRP could improve the diagnosis of early infectious complications after LT. Methods: Multicentre prospective observational study between Sep- tember 2014 and September 2015. The study included all 7 centresauthorized to perform lung transplantation in Spain.Biomarker mea- surements were executed on ICU admission (day 1) and daily till 7th postoperative day. Patients were split into two groups depending onthe presence of infectious complications.Results: Two hundred and thirty three consecutive patients (148 men, median age 56 [range 47 to 61] years) underwent single (n = 108, 46.4 %) or bilateral (n = 125, 53.6 %) LT. In the whole population,both biomarkers, PCT and CRP, presented similar kinetics duringstudy period with an initial increase in their levels, a plasma peak re- corded in the first 48 hours and a progressive decline over the next days. PCT plasma levels were similar for PGD grades 1 and 2 and in-creased significantly in the group of patients with PGD grade 3. CRPlevels were similar in all groups. The median PCT levels were signifi- cantly lower in patients without infection than in patients with 'Infec- tion' for all days of follow up (Table 2). During the first 5 postoperative days (day 0 to day 4), PCT levels beyond median valuewere statistically associated with higher risk of infection. Thus, PCT levels beyond 0.50 ng/ml on ICU admission or 1.17 ng/ml on postop- erative day 1 were associated with an increase in risk of infection oftwo-fold and three-fold respectively. Associations remain significantafter adjusting by sex, age, need of postoperative ECMO, creatinine levels and type of lung transplant. However, after stratifying by pri- mary graft dysfunction presentation these associations disappearedwith respect to the group of patients with PGD 3 and increased inthe NO PGD 3 group.Therefore, in the absence of PGD 3, previously described cut-off levels for day 0 and day 1 were significantly associ- ated with an increase of three-fold and four-fold in the risk of infec-tion development.Conclusions: In absence of severe PGD, PCT peak levels are predictor of infectious complications development during the first postopera- tive week. PGD grade 3 produce an important increase of PCT levelsand interfere with PCT infectious diagnosis ability. PCT was superiorto CRP in infections diagnosis during this period.

Le Guen, J. Moore, N. MasonCentral Manchester Foundation Trust, Critical Care Department, Manchester, UK Correspondence: M. Le Guen - Central Manchester Foundation Trust, Critical Care Department, Manchester, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A418 Introduction: The development of neuropsychological dysfunction in survivors of critical care has been widely documented in the litera-ture (1). In contrast, the impact on patient outcomes of anxiety and depression at the time of critical care admission has been less well documented (2).Objectives: We conducted a pilot study to determine the feasibility of assessing critical care patients' anxiety and depression during their admission and the potential impact of these morbidities on patient outcomes.Methods: Patients were recruited following admission to a general intensive care unit post surgical intervention. Patients had a Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) assessment on day 7 and day 15 post operatively, In addition demographic (gender, age, electivevs emergency surgery, cancer vs non-cancer surgery, prior anti-depressant use), intervention and outcome (length of stay, infection, additional oxygen requirement, in-dwelling catheter in situ) data was collected.Results: One hundred and twenty two patients were recruited to the study and 69 (56.6 %) had a HADS assessment on day 7. Amongst the 52 patients that did not have a HADS assessment completed, 27 (52 %) were discharged prior to day 7 and 16 (31 %) either refusedor were not appropriate for assessment.The completed HADS assessments indicated that 29 % and 30 % of patients had significant anxiety and depression scores respectively. Increased day 7 median anxiety scores were associated with femalegender (6 vs 4, P = 0.04), anti-depressant use (8 vs 5, P = 0.01), oxy-gen requirement (9 vs 5, P = 0.049), infection (7 vs 4, P = 0.05) and urinary catheter use (8 vs 4, P = 0.04). Increased median depression scores were associated with female gender (7 vs 5, P = 0.04) and hos-pital stay longer than 14 days(7 vs 5, P = 0.007). Twenty-four patients had a further HADS assessment on day 15, with 35 patients having been discharged from hospital in the interveningperiod. Based on Wilcoxon Signed Ranks tests, anxiety but not de-pression scores appeared to decrease during the patient's hospital stay (z = 2.03, P = 0.04 and z = 0.25, P = 0.8, respectively). Conclusions: The assessment of anxiety and depression amongst peri-operative critical care patients is feasible. Increased anxiety levelsappear associated with a number of interventions. Increased depres- sion scores appear associated with increased hospital length of stay. Anxiety but not depression levels appear to decrease over time dur-ing patients' hospital stays. References 1.

Windpassinger - Medical University of Vienna, Anesthesiology & Intensiv Care, Vienna, Austria Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A419 Introduction: Postoperative propofol for sevoflurane anesthesia. Support for this theory comes from human pain models in which propofol reduced hyper- algesia and allodynia in response to pinprick and electric stimula- tion.1Benefit may result from central and peripheral analgesic effects of sub-hypnotic doses of propofol, as well as suppression of spinal sensitization.2,3Additional analgesic effects of propofol likely result from interactions with N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA), non-NMDA re- ceptors, and via activation of gamma-aminobutyric acid A (GABA A) receptors in the dorsal root ganglion nociceptor cells. Consistent with multiple analgesic m echanisms, some studies report that patients anesthetized with propofol have less postoperative pain than those anesthetized with volatile ane sthestics.Other studies, though, do not support a postoperative analgesic effect of intraoperative propofol. Objectives: analgesia ameliorates postoperative pain, we tested the that postoperative opioid requirements are greater in pa- tients anesthetized with sevoflurane than propofol. Methods: Ninety patients having open vein stripping were random- ized to either sevoflurane or propofol bolus piritramid and patient-controlled morphine hydrochlor- ide. The primary outcome was total opioid use from the end of sur- gery until the first postoperative morning. Pain scores (11-point Likert verbal response score) were recorded by a blinded investiga- tor at 30-minute intervals for the initial 4 hours and on the first postoperative morning. Results: Sevoflurane was not superior to propofol on postoperative opioid consumption, giving a ratio of means (95 % interim-adjusted CI) of 0.91 (0.33, 2.4), P = 0.74. Medians [quartiles] of morphine sulfate equivalents were 9.8 mg [4, 19] in the sevoflurane group and 10 [6, 20] mg in the propofol group. In addition, no difference on pain score over time was found between two groups, with a mean difference on an 11-point scale of 0.20 (95 % interim- adjusted CI: -0.36,0.73, not reduce postoperative analgesia, which is consistent with most previous reports.

Melia - Quantium Medical, Barcelona, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A420Introduction: In the last decades, several methods have been developed for the noninvasive assessment of the level of consciousness during gen- eral anesthesia by processing physio logical signals. The performance of the developed indices depends on a large number of factors such as the choice of the signal, the selected parameters, the inter-individual variabil- ity, etc. However, it is not clear how the type of the model that is used for the index development and calculation can affect its performances. Objectives: The objective of the study was t o compare two electroenceph- alographic (EEG) derived depth of anesthesia indexes that were developed with two different models: an adapt ive neuro-fuzzy inference system (qCON ANFIS) and a quadratic equation model (qCON QE). The models have the same inputs based on the energy on four EEG frequency bands. Methods: After IRB approval, 71 patients scheduled for elective surgery were randomized in four groups. Anesthesia was induced using effect- site controlled, target controlled infusion with effect size concentration of propofol set to 8.6, 5.9, 3.6 or 2 g/mL while the corresponding remi- fentanil was set to 1, 2, 4 and 8 ng/mL respectively. Data were used from 2.5 minutes before to 11 minutes after starting pumps. Patients enrolled were adults from both genders with age 53 \u00b1 13 years, weight 79 \u00b1 14 kg and height 174 \u00b1 9 cm (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). The EEG was recorded with qCON 2000 monitor (Quantium Medical, Barcelona, Spain) at a sampling frequency of 1024 Hz. The qCON ANFIS and qCON QE indices were calculated on one-second EEG windows. The agreement between the two anesthesia indexes was evaluated with correlation (R2), prediction probability (Pk) and Bland Altman ana- lysis by calculating the bias and the standard deviation (SD) of the dif- ferences between the two indexes. Limits of agreement were defined as the bias \u00b1 1.96SD in which 95 % of the differences between the two indexes are expected to lie. It is considered a clinically acceptable level of agreement when two indexes would differ by less than 10 units. Results: Fig. 9shows the density plot of qCON QE vs. qCON ANFIS. Table 3shows the qCON ANFIS and qCON QE. Figure. 10shows the results of the Bland Altman analysis of qCON ANFIS versus qCON QE. Conclusions: The two indexes qCON ANFIS and qCON QE that were developed with two different models showed a strong correlation (R2> 0.95, Pk > 0.95) and a good agreement (Bias < 1 and limits of agreement < 10). In conclusions, changing the model of the qCON calculation from a fuzzy based model to a quadratic equation do not affect the index performances in depth of anesthesia assessment, with the advantage of working with a quadratic model structure that has less coefficients than the fuzzy model.

Rood, F. van de Schoor, K. van P. Pickkers, M. van den Boogaard Radboud University P.J.T. Rood - Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Intensive Care, Nijmegen, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A421 Introduction: Delirium occurs frequently in ICU patients and is associ- ated with numerous adverse effects. Apart from the hyperactive, hypoactive and mixed subtype, recently the 'rapid reversible sedation- related delirium' was described which disappears after discontinuing of sedatives and is thought to have different outcomes then regular hypoactive delirium. Apart from a burden for the patient, the presence of delirium may also increase the workload for ICU professionals. Typic- ally, workload in the ICU is measured using the Simplified Therapeutic Intervention Scoring System (TISS-28). Objectives: To determine the effect of delirium status on ICU workload. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed at the ICU of a university medical center. All ICU patients admitted between De- cember 2011 and July 2013 were classified for their delirium sub- type status, using the CAM-ICU. Peterson criteria were used to distin- guish between the delirium subtypes, added with Patel's criterion for rapid reversible sedation-related delirium. Demographics and other relevant data relating to ICU workload were collected. Results: A total of 3,926 ICU patients were admitted during the study period (Table 4). The age was 62 \u00b1 15 (mean \u00b1 SD), of which 64.6 % were male. The APACHE II score was 17 \u00b1 7, and hospital mortality was 11.6 %. Patients were ventilated for median 2 [IQR 2 -3] days. The LOS-ICU was median 1 [IQR 1 -3] day, and in-hospital LOS was median 5 [IQR 5 -17] days. In total 881 (22 %) patients were classified as delirious of which the alternating subtype had the highest inci- dence. Delirium duration was median 1 [IQR 1 -2] day, the dose of haloperidol administered was median 19 [IQR 9 -42] mg. The overall TISS-28 score was 28 \u00b1 7. After adjusting for APACHE II score the TISS-28 score did not differ between delirious patients and non- delirious patients, (28.4 \u00b1 6 versus 27.2 \u00b1 8, respectively). In addition, no differences in TISS-28 score were found between the delirium subgroups. Patients with delirium stayed significantly longer on the mechanical ventilator, in the ICU and in-hospital (all p<0.001). Conclusions: Severity of illness but not delirium contributes in a higher workload in ICU patients. Furthermore, there were no differ- ences in subgroups of delirium regarding workload. Importantly, however, delirium does burden ICU patients in the ICU.A422 A colour coded, targeted RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) protocol to improve sedation practice H. Redhead, K. Paramasivam Leeds Correspondence: Z.J. Beardow - Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust, Adult Critical Care, Leeds, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A422 Introduction: Continuous infusions of sedative analgesia prolong the duration of mechanical ventilation and increase the risk of com- plications. Numerous scoring systems exist that assess depth of sedation, with current guidelines supporting the use of the RASS (Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) [1]. Studies highlight that car- ing for more awake patients is more demanding and increases workload for healthcare staff [2,3]). A preliminary audit was under- taken on our General Intensive Care Unt (GICU) in 2014 -2015 to identify whether patients were optimal sedated, as determined by RASS. Objectives: As a result of the previous audit three main areas for im- provement were identified. 1. To achieve optimum levels of sedation as determined by RASS. 2. To achieve a gradual reduction in sedation to achieve spontaneous breathing on the ventilator at the earliest opportunity. 3. To achieve predictable and timely sedation holds. Methods: A \u00b4targeted RASS\u00b4 tool was developed, which was simple, colour coded and kept at the patient bed-side. A protocol for gather- ing data from audited sedation days was developed. The protocol was instigated over a 5 week period from 4/1/2016 to 5/2/2016. All sedated patients were included, except for those having treatment withdrawn. On each patient, data was collected at the be- ginning and end of each shift. Including baseline and target RASS, times of RASS allocation made and sedation drug usage. Data was collated on a spreadsheet within the ICU. Results: Total number of admissions were 156 patients, total number of sedated, ventilated days were 46. 38 out of the 46 patients had targets set during ward rounds (82 %) There was no difficulty allocat- ing patients to groups. 11 patients were allocated to RED which achieved 100 % compliance. 13 patients were allocated to AMBER which achieved 63 % compli- ance. Reduction in sedation drugs and RASS at the end of each shift was, on average, reduced. 14 patients were allocated to GREEN which achieved a 32 % compli- ance. Sedation drugs were largely stopped or reduced. On average the RASS was lower. Successful extubation occurred in 5 patients. Agitation leading to re-sedation occurred in 8 patients. Conclusion: A simple, clear and effective tool for communication be- tween medical and nursing staff can improve practice and be trans- lated into a real reduction in sedation drug administration and lower levels of sedation.Table 4 (abstract A421).

However, recognition of delir- ium by ICU physicians is poor [1]. To improve detection, delirium screening tools have been developed, but these are subjective and insensitive in routine, daily practice [2]. Previously, we showed that patients with and without delirium could very well be distinguished with one minute of bipolar electroencephalography (EEG) and rela- tive delta power as an indicator of slowing of background activity [3]. Based on these findings, a prototype EEG-based delirium monitor was built, with real-time artefact removal and an improved detection algorithm. Objectives: To validate an EEG-based delirium monitor in patients at risk of delirium. Methods: In this ongoing multicentre study, we will include 154 frail, surgical patients aged 60 years. Preoperatively (T-1) and on postop- erative day 1 to 3 an EEG recording is performed together with a standardized cognitive assessment that is a video-taped. Diagnosis of delirium is based on the video by two, or in case of disagreement, three delirium experts (psychiatrists, geriatricians or neurologists) in- dependent of each other, and independent of the EEG recording. EEGs are automatically analysed after artefact removal using wave- form analyses, as well as analysis of relative delta power, and com- pared with the classification of the delirium experts (gold standard), to obtain sensitivity, specificity and the predictive values. Preliminary results: Among 45 patients (75 % men, mean age 76 years, SD 7 years), 5 patients were diagnosed as delirious. The fig- ure shows the development of delirium in an example patient and the findings of the waveform analysis on the consecutive days after surgery. Sensitivity and specificity of the waveform- and relative delta power analyses were promising, and final results will be presented at the ESICM meeting. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that EEG-based monitoring is promising for objective and reliable detection of delirium in routine daily practice. References 1. Eijk, M. M. J. van et al.

An ex- cess of central serotonin can lead to an altered mental status, associ- ated with autonomic hyperactivity, and neuromuscular excitation. (Boyer EW et al . 2005, Buckley NA et al. 2014) Drugs with serotoner- gic properties are frequently and for prolonged periods administered to ICU/MCU patients. Therefore central serotonergic toxicity may con- stitute a predisposing, contributing or precipitating factor in the emergence of delirium. Purpose: to determine the number of patients admitted to the ICU or MCU who are diagnosed with delirium, and who show characteris- tics of serotonin toxicity (Sternbach 1991, Dunkley EJC et al. 2003) in association with the administration of serotonergic drugs. Methods: During a 10-week prospective observational cohort study in the ICU and MCU, patients aged 18 or older, diagnosed with delir- ium in the ICU or MCU were included. Patients were considered as delirious in case of a positive CAM-ICU and/or at the start of haloperi- dol prescription on suspicion of delirium. Once included, patients were screened for recent administered serotonergic drugs and screened for physical signs associated with serotonin toxicity by a standardized physical examination by a specifically trained physician. Results: A total of 61 patients diagnosed with delirium were enrolled. In 44 out of 61 patients (72,1 %) the use of drugs potentially contrib- uting to serotonergic toxicity was recorded. Out of 44 patients, 7 (16 %) patients showed physical signs of serotonin toxicity and in addition met the Hunter serotonin toxicity criteria, suggesting the presence of serotonergic toxicity. None of these patients were recog- nized as such by the treating physicians. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of delirious patients in the ICU might in fact be classified as suffering from central serotonin tox- icity. The awareness of potential serotonin toxicity is low among physicians. References 1. Boyer EW, Shannon M (2005) The serotonin syndrome. N Engl J Med 352:1112 -20. Fig. 11 (abstract A423).

A425 Prospective study to determine the incidence and risk factors fordelirium in cancer patients in Hospital, Mumbai, IndiaCorrespondence: MM M. Harish - Tata Memorial Hospital, Mumbai, India Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A425 Introduction: Delirium in ICU associated with both short and long term adverse outcomes. Cancer patients admitted to ICU have sev-eral risk factors to develop delirium. Most published data on delirium are about general ICU patients and there are no large studies in can- cer patients in ICU.Objectives: We conducted prospective study to know the incidence and risk factors associated with delirium in cancer patients. Methods: Adult cancer patients in ICU were included over a period of 6 months. Demographic data, type/stage of cancer, treatmentdetails including drugs administered were noted. Hemodynamic status, mechanical ventilation, presence of sepsis, patient's sleep and mobilization status were also noted for the assessment of riskfactors associated with delirium. Sedation was scored using theRichmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) and delirium was assessed using the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM-ICU) per shift by the bedside nurses, if they were responsive to verbal com-mands (RASS score of 3 or lighter level of sedation). If delirium was positive even in one shift in a day, it was considered as a delir- ium day. Results: Patients with comorbidities showed higher incidence of ICU delirium as compared to those without {73(63.5 %) vs42(36.5 %)}. Tobacco consumers showed higher incidence of delir- ium as compared to those without {85(73.1 %) vs 30(26.1 %)}. Recent chemotherapy showed positive correlation with delirium ascompared to those who did not receive chemotherapy or receivedit more than one month back {63(54.8 %) vs 51(44.3 %) vs 1(0.9 %)}. Sleep deprived patients had higher incidence of delirium as com- pared to patients without {90(78.3 %) vs 25(21.7 %)}. There was asignificant association of Midazolam with delirium as compared tothose who did not receive the drug{104(90.4 %) vs 11(9.6 %), p- 0.000}. Patients who had delirium had median length of stay 7 days as compared to 3 days among without delirium. On multivariateanalysis of the risk factors comorbidity(P-0.003,OR-13.3), tobacco con-sumption(P-0.015,OR-5.95), Midazolam(P-0.000,OR-47.50), mechanical ventilation(P-0.022,OR-9.09) and sleep deprivation (P-0.030,OR- showed statistically si gnificant association with the delirium. Delirium also showed significant association with in-creased length of both ICU (P-0.000,OR-1.73) and hospital stay (P-0.004,OR-1.02). Conclusion: Incidence of ICU delirium among cancer patients was 70.6 %. Recent chemotherapy mechanical ventilation, Midazolam,comorbidities, tobacco and sleep deprivation were the independent predictor of ICU delirium in cancer patients. ICU delirium increase both ICU and hospital length of stay. References 1. American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 4th ed, APA Press, Washington, DC 1994. 2.

Murbach - Western Parana State University Hospital, Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A426 Introduction: Delirium is defined as an acute cognitive impairment, inattention and disorganized thoughts, may be associated with the use of benzodiazepines, opioid administration, mechanical ventilation duration and immobilization, the management of it depends onmultidisciplinary team strategies.Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare the results of patients with and without Delirium that were submitted to an early mobilization protocol in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).Methods: Cohort study in the general ICU of a University Hospital, South- ern Brazil. The study was conducted between February and December 2013. Were excluded patients using mechanical ventilation for less than 24 hours, under 18 years old, patients submitted to passive exercises orwho did not have early mobilization. Only patients that received activeand active-assisted early mobilization were included. Patients were di- vided between Delirium and no-Delirium groups. Data were reported as mean and standard deviation. The variables were compared through ofMann -Whitney test, t-test parametric and the statistical significance level was 5 % (p 0.05). Results: In the period were admitted 474 patients of which 127 were in- cluded. The incidence of Delirium was 48 %. The main causes of admis-sion in groups with delirium and without delirium were medical non-neurological (34 % vs. 33 %), medical neurological (22 % vs. 9 %) and Traumatic Brain Injury (22 % vs. 26 % ). There were no significant. The data are demonstrated in Tables 5and6. Conclusion: In this cohort study, we found no differences in the outcomes of patients with or without delirium submitted to early active mobilization. Most of patients had good response to an early mobilization protocol. Table 5 (abstract A426).

Hern\u00e1ndez-S\u00e1nchez -Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog\u00eda, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Mexico, Mexico Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A427 Introduction: The presence of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is often underestimated due to its variable clinical presentation. The incidence and risk factors of delirium have not been studied in critically ill cancer patients.Objective : To evaluate the incidence and risk factors of delirium in critically ill cancer patients. Methods: The present study was an observational and descriptive study that included 69 critically ill cancer patients admitted to ICU of the Insti-tuto Nacional de Cancerolog\u00eda of M\u00e9xico, between December 2015 and March 2016. Delirium was di agnosed by daily eval uation using the Con- fusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). The clinical data was obtained from the patient\u00b4s medical record. No interventions were done.Results: Of the 69 critically ill cancer patients included in this study, 35 (50.7 %) were men; with a median age of 49.55 years; 2 (7.2 %) had his- tory of delirium, and 2 (2.9 %) had delirium at ICU admission. Solid tu- mors were the most frequent malignances 49 (71 %), and 20 (29 %)had hematological malignancies. The principal admission diagnosis toICU was septic shock in 27 (39.1 %). During the first 24 hours in ICU, 20 (68.1 %) required mechanical ventilation, 25 (36.1 %) received midazo- lam as a sedative, and 47 (68.1 %) fentanyl as an analgesic.The incidence of delirium was 15.9 %. The hyperactive type delirium wasthe most common. There was no difference between risk factors (sex, age, comorbidities, history of delirium, use of analgesic, sedation or corti- costeroids, and severity of critical illness) in patients who presented delir-ium and those who did not. The most important independent risk factorsfor delirium were the total number of ventilated days during ICU stay (P = 0.009) and the length of stay in ICU (P < 0.001). The following variables were independent predictors of delirium: the total number of ventilateddays during an ICU stay, relative risk (RR) 1.09 (95 % confidence interval(CI); 0.98 to 1.22) and the length of stay in ICU, RR: 1.173 (95 % CI; 1.04 to 1.32). The ICU mortality was 10.1 %, no patients with delirium died. Conclusion: The incidence of delirium in the oncologic ICU is low, the length of stay in ICU and the total number of ventilated daysduring an ICU stay were the most important risk factors for its pres- entation; There is no relation between delirium and ICU mortality.

Maghsoudi - Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz Anesthesiology and Critical Care Research Center, Shiraz, IslamicRepublic of Iran Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A428Introduction: Addiction is one of the main problems in our society, Iran,about 3 % of the whole population. Many of critically ill patients needing intensive care units (ICU)admission suffer from underlyingdisease such as ischemic heart disease, hypertension, diabetes andso on, and are opium addicted too. Consequently, the control of pain and agitation in the intensive care unit plays an important role in early discharge and improving patient\u00b4s outcome.Objectives: Comparing opium tincture and methadone on the con- trol of pain, agitation, and ICU outcomes in opium addicted ICU ad- mitted patients. Methods: In this randomized pilot study, a total of 50 inhalant opium addicted patients aged 18 -84 years, enrolled into the study and they were divided into two groups of 25, the opium tincture(T) and methadone group(M). Patients received morphine infusion according to needs before allowing enteral drugs (at most one day). After tha-t(as day one of study), in the T group, patients received 10 cc opiumtincture in dark tea(total 50 cc) and 10 cc normal saline intravenously (IV) every 8 hours. The M group re- ceived 50 cc dark tea via NGT plus 10 diluting to10 cc IV every 8 hours.Then patient\u00b4s pain and agitation were mea-sured and compared based on (BPS) behavioral pain scale and Rich- mond agitation sedation scale (RASS), and delirium by CAM-ICU. If BPS scale was desirable ( 0, 1), the same dose continued, but if it was1o r2, the doses was decreased or increased by 2.5 (cc or mg) respectively at next interval. Rescue medications were IV mor- phine, midazolam and haloperidol. Results: Current study shows that the use of opium tincture in the pain management(by BPS) of opium addicted ICU patients had sig-nificant desirable impact and, (p-value = 0.041) compared with methadone andafter the deleting confounding variables (p-value = 0.630) between the two groups. Extubation time, duration of ICU and hospital stay was not different between the two groups.Conclusions: In inhalational opium addicted patients admitted to ICU enable of starting oral medications, pain is better controlled with Opium Tincture in comparison to Methadone.

University Hospital, Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A429 Introduction: Patients with severe ARDS or intractable cardiogenic shock are increasingly treated with veno-venous arterio-venousextracorporeal (MIDA) and/or propofol (PROP) may be inadequate because these drugs become highly sequestrated in the circuit. The volatile anaesthetic sevoflurane (SEVO) has beenshown to be a potential alternative to IV sedation in cardiac surgeryand general ICU patients.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 222 of 607Objectives: We assessed the efficacy and safety of prolonged use of SEVO in a cohort of hemodynamically unstable critically ill patients under ECMO.Methods: Patients initially sedated with IV MIDA and/or PROP and then switched to SEVO, were retrospectively reviewed. The liquid form of SEVO was infused via a modified heat-moisture exchanger (AnaConDa\u00ae, Sedana AB, the endotracheal tube. SEVO was given as an initialbolus of 1.2 mL followed by a continuous infusion started at 5 mL/h. Infusion rate was adjusted to reach a measured end-tidal SEVO (ETS) concentration between 0.8 and 1.4 %. Sedation level aimed to obtaina RASS score of 3t o4. Mean blood pressure and norepinephrine requirement were evaluated before start of SEVO and after respect- ively 2 h and 6 h of treatment. ETS was measured after stabilization, and at 24 h and 72 h. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to com-pare variables over time. Values were expressed as means \u00b1 SD.Results: Twenty-one patients (12 males, age 53 \u00b1 15 years; 16 ARDS and 5 cardiogenic shock) were studied. Mean APACHE II score was 25 \u00b1 5. MIDA and PROP dose before start of SEVO were respectively2.1 \u00b1 2.6 mg/min and 2.4 \u00b1 Ten patients were cura- rized. Initiation of SEVO allowed immediate cessation of IV sedation and curarization. Opioid analgesia was continued unchanged. SEVO treatment was not associated with changes in MAP (73 \u00b1 12 vs. 72 \u00b110 mmHg; p = 0.56) or norepinephrine need (0.11 \u00b1 0.06 vs. 0.13 \u00b10.19; p = 0.83). As compared with baseline (1.1 \u00b1 0.3 %), ETS remained unchanged after 24 h (1.2 \u00b1 0.3 %) and 72 h (1.3 \u00b1 0.4 %). Patients were treated for 13 \u00b1 9 days. Twelve patients (57 %) survived. No ad-verse events were noted. Random 8 h-samples of ambient air in thebedside breathing zone revealed SEVO concentrations well below the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health 2 ppm limit. Conclusions: In hemodynamically unstable patients under ECMO, prolonged SEVO sedation is an effective, well-tolerated, IV MIDA and PROP-based sedation.

Contreras - Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Intensive Care Medicine, Barcelona, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A430 Introduction: Patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) usually require use of hypnotics and sedatives to ensure comfort and proper adaptation to mechanical ventilation. An important require- ment for an adequate sedation is frequent and proper assessment ofits depth. Inadequate sedation can lead to problems of over-sedation, under-sedation and/or delirium in ICU, especially in elderly patients. Objective: To compare the total dose of sedative use and the rate of over-sedation in patients over 65 years admitted to the ICU, adjust-ing sedation by monitoring with BIS\u00ae versus monitoring with the ex- clusive use of sedation scales. Methods: A randomized, clinical trial including patients over 65 years who were admitted to the ICU affected with medical or surgicalpathology of non neurological etiology who required sedation for more than 24 hours to maintain adaptation to mechanical ventila- tion. Patients were randomized into two groups: the interventiongroup using BIS monitoring to adjust sedation in order to maintainvalues between 50 -60 and; the control group in which sedation wasadjusted with the exclusive use of Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS) to maintain RASS 2. The study was approved by the institution's Research Ethics Committee. Statistical analysis: We usedthe chi square test to compare categorical data and proportions, andthe T-test, Mann -Whitney test or Kruskal-Wallis, as appropriate, to compare continuous variables. An alpha level of 0.05 was used to determine statistical significance. All data in the present study wasanalyzed using SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, USA).Results: Until now 56 patients have been randomized. 27 (48 %) pa- tients in the control group and 29 (52 %) in the intervention group. Related to the general characteristics, demographics (age, weight,height, gender), medical history (hypertension, diabetes, cognitiveimpairment, lung disease and chronic renal failure), pathology and admission severity scores (APACHE II and SOFA) there were not sta- tistically significant differences between groups. Besides analgesia;midazolam, propofol or remifentanil were also used in both groups(without significant differences). There were not statistically signifi- cant differences in midazolam and propofol, total daily dose, days of mechanical ventilation, ventilator associated pneumonia, delirium,ICU mortality and ICU length of stay.Conclusions: No statistically significant differences were observed be- tween the groups of this pilot study using BIS to adjust the sedation. We attribute these findings mainly to the lack of adherence to theprotocol. References 1.Sedation and analgesia in the critically ill Fraser GL, Riker RR - Curr 1, 2007; 20 (2); 119 -23 2.

A431 An audit of sedation use and sedation scores in intensive careI. Elias-Jones, L. Gemmell, A. MacKayQueen Elizabeth University hospital, Anaesthetics and Intensive Care, Glasgow, UK Correspondence: I. Elias-Jones - Queen Elizabeth University hospital, Anaesthetics and Intensive Care, Glasgow, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A431 Introduction: How much sedation is given, and for how long, is im- portant in determining patient outcome as both over sedation andunder sedation can have potentially deleterious consequences. Over sedation can increase time on ventilator support and prolong ICU duration of stay. Under sedation can cause hyper-catabolism, immu-nosupporession, hypercoagulability and increase sympatheticactivity. Objectives: The aim of this audit was to look at our use of sedation in a large 18bed teaching unit in Glasgow. We aimed to look at pro-pofol dosage, to particularly look if patients exceeded their maximumhourly dose, sedation scoring tools and whether it was regularly assessed, the addition of other sedative agents and when, and whether sedation load was associated with increased ventilator days.Methods: We looked at a snapshot of 40patients picked at random admitted to the Queen Elizabeth University hospital, Glasgow over the previous six months. The Richmond-Agitation Sedation scale was used as the sedation scoring tool.Results: Data was collected for 40patients. 57.5 % were male. The median age was 57 years. Weight and height were not documented for 21patients. 6 patients were given in excess of the recommended dose of propofol according to weight (mg/kg/hr). These were six ofthe patients in which weight was actually documented so exceedingmaximum recommended daily dosing could have been more of anIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 223 of 607issue than is described. All patients were sedated with propofol and an opiate, either remifentanil or alfentanil. Half of the patients were found to be over sedated in the time period, with RASS scores of 4 or5. Six out of the forty patients did not have sedation scores doc- umented daily as part of their care. When other agents were consid- ered, they were considered relatively late in the patient stay (days 4 - 5). CK and triglycerides were never checked when propofol had been used in high doses for a significant length of time. Average length of ventilation was 4 days (12 hours - 12 days) with unsurprisingly higher propofol use seen in the patients ventilated for longer periods of time. Excess sedation was more common in the younger patient with a past history of drug or alcohol dependence. Conclusions: Delirium and over sedation is associated with an in- crease in morbidity and mortality. As can be seen from our snapshot of data, we are poor at documenting daily sedation scores, with a significant proportion of our patients being documented as over se- dated. Propofol use is excessive, and could perhaps lead to iatro- genic complications and morbidity. Patients who were heavily sedated were ventilated for longer. We are now working on a sedation protocol within our unit to im- prove our practice. References 1. K.Rowe. Sedation in the Intensive Care Unit.

Kirwan1,2 Transplant Medicine, London, UK; 2Barts Health NHS Trust, Adult Critical Care, London, UK Correspondence: C.J. Kirwan - Barts Health NHS Trust, Renal and Transplant Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A432 Introduction: There is evidence that the type of intravenous fluid used in patients who are critically ill or who have undergone major surgery may have an impact on the progression and recovery of Acute Kidney Injury. Patients undergoing renal transplantation are not specifically in- cluded in this work. Our centre changed the general peri-operative fluid regimen from routine use of normal saline (NS) to Plasmalyte (bal- anced solution containing physiological sodium, chloride, potassium, magnesium with an acetate buffer), including all patients undergoing renal transplantation. We hypothesised that this change would reduce peri-operative hyperkalaemia and thus reduce the need for immediate renal replacement therapy (RRT). Methods: The peri-operative fluid management guidance was chan- ged in March 2013. We performed a single centre retrospective ob- servational study of consecutive renal transplant recipient's pre and post policy change to assess its impact on transplant patients. The local renal database, patient notes, a computer based pathology sys- tem and clinic letters were used to collect data. We excluded pa- tients with incomplete data of the peri-operative period, who had not received the standard fluid regimen of the time and those with an immediate surgical complication that rendered dialysis inevitable. Results: There were 47 transplant recipients in the NS group and 29 in the Plasmalyte group. The percentage of patients not requiring RRT in the first 48 hours post operatively in the Plasmalyte group were significantly higher than in the NS group (D1 97 vs 81 % p 0.046, D2 94 vs. 72 %, p 0.025) (Fig. 12). There were no cases of hyperkalaemia in the immediate post operative period for patients who had received Plasmalyte (P < 0.0001) (Fig. 13).A greater urine output in the first 24 hours after surgery was ob- served in the plasmalyte group, 2195mls (95 % CI:1423 -2966) vs. 913.8mls (95 % CI:563.3-1264, P < 0.0001) which may indicate earlier onset of recovery from the post transplant AKI. Baseline characteris- tics were similar between each group except there were a higher proportion of DCD donors in the NS group compared to the Plasma- lyte group (36 % vs. 17 %, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Renal transplant recipients who did not have an imme- diate surgical complication and received only Plasmalyte in the peri- operative period, had a lower incidence of RRT in the first 48 hours following surgery than those who received normal saline. This may be attributed to the lower incidence of immediate hyperkalaemia in the Plasmalyte group.

Despite this, very little specific action is taken to prevent post-operative pulmonary complications (PPC) within major surgery programmes. Even the Enhanced recovery after surgery [ERAS] programme, does not specifically address this. Objectives: Central Manchester Foundation Trust (CMFT) successfully implemented ERAS+ aimed at reducing PPC in 2014 and we now have results to show its sustained benefit. Methods: Using quality improvement methodology, a multidisciplinary team developed an innovative surgical pathway combined with ele- ments of ERAS. Working with the Boston Medical Centre, we produced ICOUGH UK2consisting of - Incentive spirometry, Coughing and deep breathing, Oral care, Understanding (patient and family education), Getting out of bed and Head-of-bed elevation. Additional innovations within the ERAS+ include: Prehabilitation/Reablement tools; SURGERY SCHOOL - patient and family preparation session and ICOUGH UK multimedia resources including ICOUGH TV. Pathway innovation oc- curred during sponsored listening sessions with patients and relatives. We introduced ICOUGH prescriptions attached to drug charts to pro- mote compliance and this was audited weekly. All elective surgical pa- tients requiring critical care admission were screened for the development of PPC on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 15 after surgery using stand- ard definitions3. We prospectively measured baseline PPC between April 2013 -4 and repeated PPC audit following introduction of ERAS+ in September 2014 through to Jan 2016. Results: ERAS+ has been successfully developed and embedded in a large NHS university teaching hospital. More than 200 critical care nurses have been trained in ERAS+. Surgery school has been embed- ded, with over 350 patients attending; qualitative feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Since September 2014, utilising ERAS+ within critical care in greater than 500 patients has resulted in a sus- tained reduction of 40 % in PPCs. Conclusions: ERAS+ implementation into a large teaching hospital has successfully reduced PPCs in major surgery patients. ERAS+ can be rapidly adopted by European healthcare, with a significant reduc- tion in patient morbidity and hospital length of stay. This innovation aligns with domains 1, 3 -5 of the NHS Outcome Framework4. References Moonesinghe et al. 'Survival after postoperative a observational 977 -84 1.

Gaudard3, Hospital and Pierre and Marie Curie University, Reanimation Hopital Universitaire Necker Enfants Malades, Pediatric Cardiac Intensice Care Unit, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A434 Introduction: Inhaled NO is a well-known selective pulmonary vaso- dilator in Europe since 20 years nevertheless few study really de- scribed the daily ICU practice. The objective of this study was to determine the gap between guidelines and real life. Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective, observational study on iNO administered through an integrated delivery and monitoring de- vice (EZ-Kinox) in 12 French and 1 Belgian centers for pulmonary ar- terial hypertension after cardiac surgery (PAH CS) and for persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). The following pa- rameters were observed: dose, treatment duration, ventilation modes, monitoring procedures, weaning procedures and occurrence of a rebound effect. Concomitant pulmonary vasodilators treatments and safety data were also collected. Results: 236 patients were studied among 238 patients enrolled within one year period : 81 children and 117 adults with PAHCC and 38 neonates with PPHN. Echocardiography or pulmonary artery catheterization were performed to diagnose PAH respectively in 86 % and 31 % of the cardiac patients. In the neonatal group 97.4 % had an echocardiographic diagnosis. Inhaled NO was initiated before ICU admission in adult population (57 %) but rarely in cardiac pediatric patients (12.7 %), p < 0.01 and 38.9 % in neonates. The me- dian initial dosage of iNO set was 20 ppm [18 -20] in the cardiac pediatric group and 10 [10 -15] for adults and 16.7 ppm [11.2- 20] for neonates with a median duration respectively 3.9 days [1.9- 6.1], 3.8 days [1.8-6.8] and 3.07 days [1.04-5.74]. The NO therapy clas- sically was delivered during controlled ventilation mode including high frequency oscillation and more and more via non invasive venti- lation as high flow nasal cannula. The clinical effect of iNO was con- sidered sufficient in 89 % of the cases and the dose was gradually decreased before definitive withdrawal in 86 % of the cases. Adverse effects (AE) occurred 75 times (80 % of the patients without AE) in- cluding rebound effect in 1.2 % of children, 3.4 % of adults and 2.6 % of neonates, methaemoglobinemia was observed on 7.9 % of neonates and 1.7 % of adults. The NO 2generated by contact be- tween NO and O2 was above 0.5 ppm value in 17 % of the pediatric cases, 1 % of the adult cases and never observed on neonates popu- lation. All these AE monary vasodilators (levosimendan, sildenafil, milrinone) were associated in 95 % of the cases in pediatrics, 23 % in adults (p < 0.01) and 23.7 % in neonates. ICU stay was 8 days [6 -15] for children, 10 days [6 -16] for adults and 3.7 days [1 -5.7] for neonates. Fig. 14 (abstract A433). Incidence of PPC in major elective surgery patientIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 225 of 607Discussion. This survey confirms the good efficacy and safety of NO therapy in the three populations. Occurrence of rebound effect is particularly rare with a large application of a gradually withdrawal of iNO and pulmonary vasodilators use. The usage of last generation of NO devices subject to prior training allows good compliance with recommendations. A435 Peri-operative use of plasmalyte in kidney transplant recipients improves biochemical profile and may result in faster renal recovery D. Randall1, A. Adwaney1, M. Blunden1, J.R. Prowle1,2, C.J. Kirwan1,2 Transplant Medicine, London, UK; 2Barts Health NHS Trust, Adult Critical Care, London, UK Correspondence: C.J. Kirwan - Barts Health NHS Trust, Renal and Transplant Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A435 Introduction: Administration of normal saline has been associated with the development and exacerbation of acute kidney injury, [1] and this may be related to hyperchloraemia. Since recipients of kidney trans- plants often require large volumes of fluid replacement, we hypothe- sised improved post-operative biochemistry and quicker renal recovery following a switch from saline to Plasmalyte fluid therapy during the routine peri-operative period. Methods: The peri-operative fluid management guidance was chan- ged in our centre in March 2013. We performed a single centre retro- spective observational study of consecutive renal transplant recipients before and after the policy change to assess its impact on transplant patients. We used the local renal and pathology databases, paper and computerised patient notes and clinic letters to collect data. We excluded patients with incomplete data of the peri- operative period or who had not received the standard fluid regimen of the time. Results: 47 patients received normal saline and 29 received plasmalyte. Demographics were similar between groups, except the saline group contained more patients receiving a kidney donated after cardiac death (36 % vs 17 %, p < 0.001). In both groups, fluid administration rates were matched to urine output and overall fluid balance was equal between the two groups. Electrolyte data for the two groups are shown in Fig. 15 and demonstrate significantly higher potassium and chloride and lower bicarbonate levels in the normal saline group (P < 0.0001). There was a higher proportion of hyperkalaemia (serum K+ >6.0 mmol/L) immediately post-op (21 % vs 0 %), over the first 24 hours (32 % vs 21 %) and over the second 24 hours post- operatively (15 % vs 7 %) in the patients who received normal saline (P < 0.001). The saline group had a longer length of stay (11 days vs 7 days, p < 0.0001), and lower eGFR at 3 months post-op (43 vs 51 ml/min; P = 0.016), although by 1-year post-transplant, mean renal function was identical at 51 ml/min in both groups (Fig. 16). Conclusions: The sole use of Plasmalyte fluid replacement in the peri-operative period is associated with improved potassium, chloride and acid base homeostasis after kidney transplantation when com- pared to normal saline. The use of Plasmalyte is safe (despite the concern that it contains potassium), and may be associated with im- proved early renal outcomes. Whilst evidence of benefit for balanced replacement fluids in the general population is conflicting, after transplantation the effects may be more pronounced as the volumes of fluid administered are greater.

Kim, S. Na, J. Kim Yonsei University College of Medicine, Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea Correspondence: S.H. Kim - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Anesthesia and Pain Medicine, Seoul, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A436 Introduction: Owing to an aging society, both the number of opera- tions for patients aged >85 years and the average age of patients ad- mitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) are rapidly increasing. However, mortality is not an appropriate outcome measurement in patients aged >85 years; a more important outcome is home return (HR), because the quality of life is valuable to these patients. Objectives: To identify predictors for HR of patients aged >85 years admitted to the ICU after surgery. Study design and settings: Retrospective analysis of medical records at a university hospital. Subjects: Patients aged >85 years admitted to the ICU after surgery (n = 187). Fig. 15 (abstract A435). Fig. 16 (abstract A435).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 226 of 607Methods: Patients were divided into a HR group (patients who returned home after discharge) and non-HR group (deceased or transferred to nursing facilities). Perioperative data and outcomewere assessed and compared. Multivariate logistic regression analysiswas conducted to identify independent predictors. Results: The average age of patients was 88 years. HR occurred in 61 % of patients, and mortality was 9 %. The HR group showedhigher preoperative albumin level than the non-HR group. More pa-tients in the non-HR group experienced hip surgery than in the HR group (51 % vs. 12 %, P < 0.001). APACHE II score was higher (P < 0.001) in the non-HR group. In multivariate analysis, preoperative al-bumin, hip surgery, and APACHE II score were identified as inde-pendent predictors of HR. Conclusion: Predictors of HR of surgical critically ill elderly patients included preoperative albumin level, hip surgery, and APACHE IIscore on ICU admission. References 1.

Oh - Seoul National University College of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Seoul, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A437 Introduction: Immediate postoperative liver transplant recipients are at risk for developing acute kidney injury (AKI) with a reported inci- dence between 17 to 95 %. Recent findings suggest that the chloride-rich resuscitation fluids may increase the incidence of acutekidney injury in critically ill and surgical patients. Hyperchloremicfluids have been shown to induce renal vasoconstriction, attenuate renal artery flow velocity, and reduce renal cortical tissue perfusion. Objectives: The association between postoperative serum chloride levels and the incidence of immediate postoperative acute kidney in-jury in the ICU in liver transplant recipients were evaluated. Methods: Adult patients ( 18 years old) who underwent liver trans- plantation at Seoul National University Hospital between July 2010and December 2012. Preoperative serum chloride levels were mea-sured within 24 hours before the operation and postoperative serum chloride levels were routinely measured every 8 hours during the ini- tial 72 hours after ICU admission (10 measurements). The averageserum chloride level was defined as the average of the 10 serumchloride levels in patients who did not develop AKI or developed AKI 72 hours after liver transplantation and the average of the preopera- tive serum chloride level and the serum chloride levels measured be-fore the development of AKI in those who developed AKI within72 hours. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their average chloride level.; normochloremia outcome was postoperative AKI accordingto the RIFLE criteria. Secondary outcomes included in-hospital mor- tality and surgical site infection.Results: AKI developed in 46.6 % (158/339) of the patients. The over- all in-hospital mortality was 4.7 %. Compared to normochloremia, AKI was more frequent in patients with hyperchloremia (adjusted OR1.826 [95 % CI 1.133-2.944], P OR8.794 [95 % CI 1.820-42.498], P = 0.007). There was no difference in pre- operative chloride levels between patients who developed AKI and those who did not (104.54 \u00b1 both associ- ated with an increased risk of developing AKI in the immediate post- operative period after liver transplantation in the ICU.

Salciccioli - Imperial College London, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A438 Introduction: Electrolyte abnormalities are common in critically ill populations and are associated with mortality. Previous reports have demonstrated a relationship between serum sodium fluctuations and mortality in a cohort of surgical critically ill patients (1 -3). Objectives: Our primary aim was to assess the association between serum sodium fluctuations and 28-day mortality in a cohort of adult surgical patients requiring intensive care. Our secondary aim was to assess the association between dysnatraemia and 28-day mortality insurgical patients requiring intensive care.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Multi- Parameter Intelligent Monitoring in Intensive Care (MIMIC-II) data- base. Subjects were categorized by severity of dysnatraemia and so-dium fluctuations during the index ICU admission. Dysnatraemia wasdefined as a sodium concentration upon ICU admission outside range (135 -145 mmol/L). Univariate and multivariable lo- gistic regression was used to test primary and secondary aims.Results: We identified 8600 subjects, 39 % female with a median age of 66 years for analysis; 28-day mortality was 8 %. Fluctuations in serum sodium were found to be associated with 28-day mortality (adjusted odds ratio (OR) per 1 mmol/L change: 1.10 (95%CI 1.08-1.13)) in dysnatraemia. In subjects who remained normotraemic,there was an association between fluctuation in serum sodium and 28-day mortality (adjusted OR 1.13, 95%CI 1.10 - 1.16; p < 0.001). Sub- jects with dysnatraemia were more likely to be dead at 28-days(17 % vs 7 %; p < 0.001). Severity of dysnatraemia was associatedwith 28-day of serum sodium, including in patients whose sodium remained within the normal range, were independ- ently associated with an increase in 28-day mortality. Severity of dys-natraemia was associated with 28-day mortality. These findings areconsistent with previous reports and suggest that minor fluctuations in sodium may be associated with mortality.

A ratio >1 reflects the meta-bolic tipping point at which CO 2production exceeds oxygen consumption, akin to the anaerobic threshold in cardiopulmonary ex- ercise testing, but with the advantage of measurement from pairedarterial and central venous blood gas analysis. It is of prognosticvalue in critical care, and in sepsis when combined with lactate[1, 2]. We investigate the role of Cv-aCO 2/Da-vO 2in liver resection surgery. Our anaesthetic technique uses fluid restriction, diuresis and venodi-lation to decrease CVP, which improves outcome[3]. On fluid therapy (GDFT) is initiated. This tech- nique provides an ideal model of rapid haemodynamic changes in which to investigate Cv-aCO 2/Da-vO 2. Objectives: To establish: 1) Is Cv-aCO 2/Da-vO 2and outcome? 2) or serum lactate correlate with cardiac output (CO) Methods: This is a subset of data from the prospective observational study MicroHepFlow, investigating microcirculation in liver resectionsurgery. All patients received general and thoracic was anaesthetists' discretion. Prospectivedata was collected at pre-defined time points. The Clavien-Dindo(CD) Classification was used for post-operative complications. Statis- tical analysis was with linear regression and Fischers exact test. Results: In 31 patients, 17 with CO data, a Cv-aCO 2/Da-vO 2> 1 and lactate 2 was common (55 at maximal desiccation and 52 % fol- lowing GDFT). There was no consistent relationship between this and the incidence of complications. C-D complications Grade III were rare (6 %). Neither Cv-aCO 2/Da-vO 2, inverse CO2 gap nor serum lac- tate concentration significantly correlated with The expected association between Cv-aCO 2/ Da-vO 2> 1 and lactate 2 with post-operative complications was not observed, potentially due to a low incidence of serious complica-tions. The lack of significant correlation between Cv-aCO2 / Da-vO2and inverse CO2 gap with cardiac output is informative and suggests that these variables are poor surrogates of cardiac output in this setting.

Bossy - Royal Surrey County Hospital, ICU and SPACeR Research Group, Intensive Care, Guildford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A440 Introduction: Despite goal-directed fluid therapy, vasopressor sup- port may be necessary in the early post-operative period to maintain adequate systemic blood pressure. Persistent requirement for moder-ate doses of vasopressor support (vasoplegia) has not been reportedin patients recovering from following major gynae-oncology debulk- ing surgery (GODS). Risk factors for, and complications of, vasoplegia have not been described.Objectives: Describe the incidence of vasoplegia following GODS, and the risk factors for, and complications of, vasoplegia. Methods: Patients were identified from our ICU patient database (WardWatcher software) and additional clinical details acquired fromelectronic databases including the IntelliSpace Critical Care andanesthesia (Philips) and a local bespoke system (The Guildford Gynae-oncology database). Statistical analysis was performed using binary logistic regression using log transformed data for all non-parametric variables (SPSS).Results: Between February 2014 and September 2015 there were 176 elective admissions to our ICU for care of patients following GODS. The median age was 67 years (IQR range 56 -76) and median weight was 70 kg. 75 % had ovarian or endometrial cancer. The me-dian estimated blood loss (EBL) was 900mls. 67.1 % of this group had an epidural inserted for post-operative analgesia and the mean rate of a standard infusion was 10mls/h. 52.3 % of patients receiveda vasopressor for at least one hour during their post-operative stayon ICU (either phenylephrine or noradrenaline). 16.5 % of the group remained on a dose of noradrenaline 0.1mcg/kg/min at 08:00 on the first post operative day - considered to reflect vasoplegia. MedianICU length of stay (LOS) was 2.0 days (IQ range 1.1-3.0), and medianhospital LOS 5.7 days (IQR 4.3-7.1). ICU mortality was < 1 % (1/176) and 6 month mortality 4 % (7/176). The only pre-operative variable associated with requiring vasopressors was haemoglobin; medianwas 119 g/L in those who required vs. 128 g/L in those who did not(p = 0.02). Epidural use was associated with requiring vasopressors (OR 3.74,CI 1.91-7.30, p < 0.005). Cumulative fluid balance was associ- ated with vasoplegia (OR of log 26.22, CI 4.75-144.59, p < 0.005) anda peak lactate greater than median, 3.1 mmol/L (OR of log 4.99, CI1.63-15.33, p = 0.005). The presence of vasoplegia was association with a prolonged hospital stay (odds ratio of 6.40, CI 2.31-17.70, p < 0.0005).Hospital LOS in those who didn't require any vasopressors was 4.9d(3.9-6.1), in those who required some vasopressors was 5.8d (5.0-7.9), and in those with had vasoplegia was 7.0d (6.0-9.8), p < 0.0001 KWT.Intensive Care Medicine 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 228 of 607Conclusions: Lower pre-operative haemoglobin concentration was associated with requirement for vasopressors, as was epidural use and cumulative fluid balance. Vasoplegia was uncommon, associatedwith cumulative fluid balance and elevated peak lactate, and a pro-longed duration of hospital stay. Mortality was low.

University of Foggia, Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Foggia, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A442 Introduction: Patients undergoing thoracic surgery commonly undergo a radial catheter placement to fulfill the need for continu- ous blood pressure monitoring, other than blood gasanalyses 1.Objectives: In this prospective observational study, we recorded cardiac output and pressure measurements obtained by an uncali- brated pulse contour method in a totally non invasive manner(ClearSight system, Edwards Lifesciences) to assess hemodynamicvariations during normal and one lung ventilation (OLV) in supine and lateral decubitus in thoracic surgery. Methods: After Ethical Committee approval was obtained, we en- rolled patients with age > 18 years, scheduled for thoracic surgeryand OLV with double-lumen tube in lateral decubitus. Exclusion criteria: ASA > III, severe baseline hemodynamic impairment which required invasive monitoring and amine infusion.Key hemodynamic parameters, including Stroke Volume Index (SVI),Stroke Volume Variation (SVV), Cardiac Index (CI) and Continuous Blood Pressure (cBP) were recorded at three time points: two lung ventilation in supine position (T1), two lung ventilation in lateral de-cubitus (T2) and one lung ventilation in lateral decubitus (T3).Results: 11 consecutive patients scheduled for thoracic surgery were included. Overall, our patients showed no hemodynamic impairment throughout the passage to and T3 vs T1). Only in 3 patients a decrease in CI was detected after the position change ( 37 %, 42 % and 43 %, respectively, T2 vs T1), which required prompt intervention.Conclusions: The lack of invasiveness and the simplicity of the system allowed satisfactory monitoring and, subsequently, appro- priate therapy, without the need of arterial catheter placementfor invasive monitoring, while an automatic, intermittent, non-invasive blood pressure measurement would have not readily detected the observed hemodynamic variations. Even if most studies underline the not-interchangeability of thefinger cuff method with the currently used invasive devices 2,i n our low to moderate risk thoracic surgery patients not receiving an arterial line, ClearSight was able to track hemodynamic changes during the different phases of the surgical procedure, inparticular those related to position changes and to the OLV.

Methods: Prospective study. Surgical intensive care unit, university hospital.Patients and interventions: 129 hemodynamic measurements using the PiCCO (Pulsion Medical System, Germany) were performed in 28 patiens major liver resection.Results: Mean CVP (8,44 mL/m2) was decreased. Forty-two CVP measurements were elevated despite simultaneous GEDI levels indicating a normal or decreased preload. Sensitivity, specificity,positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of CVP with re-gard to volume depletion (GEDI < 650) were 8,25 (0 -14,66. CI 95 %), 100 (99,89-100, CI 95 %), 100 (50 -100, CI 95 %), 29, 4 (21,99-26,96, CI 95 %) respectively. CVP did not correlate to GEDI (r = 0,045, p = 0,42), CI (r = 0,13, p = 0,216) and EVLWI (extravascular lung water index)(r =0,04, p = correlated to CI (r = 0,23, p<0 , 0 1 ) a n d S ( r= 0,32, p < 0,01). Conclusions: Volume depletion according to GEDI was found in more than half the patiens. The predictive values of CVP with regard tovolume depletion were low GEDI and its changes significantly corre- lated to CI and its changes, which was not observed for CVP. There- fore, GEDI appears to be more appropiate for volume managementduring mayor liver resections with the aim to avoid intraoperativebleeding and transfusi\u00f3n.

A444 Incidence, risk factors of weaning-induced pulmonary oedema fluid Kremlin-Bic\u00eatre, France;2The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Department of Emergency Medicine and Critical Care Medicine, Chongqing, China;3Affiliated Hospital of Guizhou Medical University, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Guiyang, ChinaCorrespondence: cause of weaning failure, but its incidence and risk factors have not been established and the effects of fluid removal have notbeen systematically described.Objectives: To describe the epidemiology of WiPO and the effects of diuretics. Methods: We included 81 patients who performed 283 spontaneous breathing trials (SBT).Three experts established the diagnosis of WiPObased on various patient characteristics. Demographic data were col- lected. A passive leg raising (PLR) test was performed before SBT in 81 patients. We also observed the effects of diuretics when this treat-ment was decided.Results: SBT failed in 129 cases (46 % of all SBT). WiPO occurred in 59 % of these failing cases. Compared to patients without WiPO (n = 52), patients with at least one WiPO (n = 29) had a significantlyhigher prevalence of obesity (45 % vs. 17 %, resp), COPD (38 % vs.12 %, resp), dilated cardiopathy (48 % vs. 17 %, resp) and low left ventricular ejection fraction (55 % vs. 21 %, resp). In 16 cases with WiPO and a negative PLR at baseline, diuretics were administered. In9 of these cases, the PLR remained negative before the followingSBT. A new episode of WiPO occurred in 7 of these instances while the two other ones were extubated. In 7 other cases, the PLR be- came positive before the following SBT. WiPO did not occur anymorein 6 of these 7 patients who were extubated, while the remainingone was not. Conclusions: WiPO was responsible for 59 % of weaning failures. Obesity, previous cardiopathy and COPD were its main risk factors.When fluid removal had changed preload-independence to preload-dependence, the following SBT was very likely to succeed.

Care, Milano, Italy;2Politecnico di Milano, Department of information and Bioengineering, Milano, Italy;3Universit\u00e0 degli studi di Milano, Department Ospedale Luigi of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Milano, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A445Introduction: Pulmonary and cardiac systems are deeply connected in physiologic conditions by autonomic nervous system. In particular Re- spiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) modifies heart rate in correspondence ofinspiration to permit a better ventilation-perfusion matching. Cardio-respiratory phase synchronization analysis (CRPS) defined as a repetitive occurrence of m heartbeats at the same relative phases within n consecu- tive breathing cycles, also provides indexes relevant to nonlinear interac-tions between cardiac and respiratory systems complementary to RSA (1).These mechanisms are poorly studie d during mechanical ventilation. Objectives: Aim of the study was to compare cardio-ventilatory inter- actions in different mechanical ventilation modes by means of CRPSand RSA analysis.Methods: The study was conducted in the Intensive Care Unit of Luigi Sacco Hospital, Milan, Italy. The experimental protocol consisted of three randomized sessions of 30 minutes corresponding to differ-ent ventilation modes: Pressure Control Ventilation (PCV), Neurally Ventilatory Assist (NAVA). Electrocardiographic (ECG) and airway volume (AWV) signals were acquired at 250 Hz sampling rate and continuously registered(Philips IntelliVue MX800, iXtrend software). Signals were analyzedoffline: the Hilbert transform was applied to AWV signal to estimate the respiration phase. In the synchrogram the phase values of the AWV observed in correspondence of the R-wave peak on the ECGwas drawn as function of the cardiac beat number. The quan-tification of cardio-respiratory coupling was assessed by the syn- chronization index (SYNC), i.e. the percentage of beats in which it could be observed the most frequent PLR. RSA amplitude, the differ-ence between the longest and the shortest R-R interval on the ECG,was estimate for each respiratory cycle. Results: 20 mechanically ventilated patients were included. Mechan- ical ventilation was set to guarantee constant minute ventilation (MV10 \u00b1 4 vs 10 \u00b1 3 vs for PCV, PSV and NAVA re-spectively). CRPS analysis showed a significant variation of SYNC index between the different modes (Fig. 3), while RSA was not able to detect meaningful differences (23 \u00b1 26 ms, 24 \u00b1 24 ms and 22 \u00b122 ms, p = 0.6, for PCV, PSV and NAVA respectively).Conclusions: Analysis of CRPS is possible in ventilated patients. Our results endorse the hypothesis that under ventilation with a fixed fre- quency, the interactions between cardiac and respiratory fluctuationswere stronger than in the case of patient driven modes of mechan-ical ventilation, as PSV and NAVA (2). The lack of variation of RSA may be due to sedation and mechanical ventilation. References 1. Sch\u00e4fer C et al., Heartbeat synchronized with ventilation. Nature. 1998 Mar 19;392(6673):239 -40. 2.

Drugs and poisons in the ICU A446 Substance abuse as predictor of in-hospital mortality in patients with cardiac arrestK.H. Tollisen1, G.\u00d8. Andersen2, F. Heyerdahl3, D.

Tollisen - Oslo University Hospital, Acute Medicine, Oslo, Norway Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A446 Introduction: Initial cardiac rhythm (ICR) is associated with mortality in cardiac arrest (CA) patients with return of spontaneous circulationIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 230 of 607(ROSC) [1]. However, knowledge regarding a possible association be- tween substance abuse and mortality is limited. Objectives: (1)To determine whether substance abuse is associated with in-hospital mortality in patients with CA admitted to ICU`s (intensive careunits), and (2) to study the association between substance abuse and ICR. Methods: CA patients with ROSC -admitted to Feb.3, 2014 Feb.2,2015 -were in- cluded as part of a multicenter prospective observational study ofICU patients in Oslo (n = 900). Informed consent was given by the next of kin, and if possible, later by the patient. Illicit drug/alcohol abuse (acute or chronic) was assessed via standard questionnaires,biochemical analysis (drug screen) and medical records. The patientswere divided into groups based on ICR: 1) non-shockable rhythm (asystole/pulseless electric activity) and 2) shockable rhythm (VF/VT). Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis, p value < 0.05 wasconsidered statistically significant.Results: 145 patients (116 (80 %) males)) were included, reflecting a participation rate of 95 %. 72(50 %) had non-shockable rhythm, and 73(50 %) had shockable rhythm (mean age 62 vs 63). There were sig-nificantly more females in the non-shockable group (21vs.8, p < 0.01),corresponding with earlier studies. Acute drug intoxication was con- sidered triggering cause in 7 patients (5 %), all males (mean age 43vs 64). Main agents were: opioids (4/7), alcohol benzodiazepines (1/7). All these pa-tients were in the non-shockable group. However, the sample size was too small for further analysis to be pursued. Among the 31 (21 %) classified with chronic substance abuse(27(87 %)males, mean age 59 vs. 64) alcohol was the predominantsubstance (75 %), followed by illicit substances (21 %) and prescrip- tion drugs (5 %). The proportion of patients with chronic abuse was significantly higher among patients with non-shockable rhythm(32 % vs 13 % p = 0.005). In-hospital mortality was significantlyhigher among patients with non-shockable rhythm (83 % vs 42 %, p < 0.001). Chronic abuse, however, was not significantly associated with in-hospital mortality (p = 0.43).Conclusions: Chronic substance abuse is common among patients with CA and is significantly associated with non-shockable ICR. As expected, in-hospitality mortality was significantly higher in the non-shockable group. Although chronic abuse was associated with non-shockable ini-tial rhythm, it was not associated with in-hospital mortality. References 1.

A447 Volatile or intravenous anesthetics in a mouse model of cardiacarrest?M.C. de Waard, A.R.J. Girbes VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Correspondence: M.C. de Waard - VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A447 Introduction: Cardiac arrest (CA) is a major health problem in western countries. Despite improvements in quality of treatment, itstill has a high rate of morbidity and mortality in patients. CA results in a harmful inflammatory response and overwhelming amounts of reactive oxygen species are produced, spreading out across thebody, causing leakage of vascular walls and damage to organs. Themouse is an increasingly used preferred model in preclinical CA stud- ies due to the knowledge concerning the mouse genome and the general availability of genetically modified mice. Volatile anestheticsare often used in these models as they are easy to apply and short-acting. However, volatile anesthetics are known to protect against I/R injury, reduce myocardial infarct size by preconditioning and may protect vital organs by postconditioning.Objectives: This pilot study investigates the use of i.v. or volatile anesthetics in a mouse model for CA.Methods: Experiments were approved by the ethical committee of VU Medical Centre Amsterdam. Mice randomly assigned to one of the two groups. Thereafter they were weighed, sedated with 4 % sevoflurane andbuprenorphine (0.05 mg/kg on a heating mat. The mice were pressure- controlled ventilated with 21 % O 2(90-100 breaths/min, PEEP 2O, mg/kg, 1.56 mg/kg, 1.56 mg/kg i.v.). 21 mice were se- dated and anesthetized with sevoflurane and 6 with FMA. Electrocardio- gram (ECG) was recorded continuously. For measurement of aorticpressure, a fluid filled polyethylene catheter was inserted in the right ca-rotid artery, advanced into the aortic arch and connected to a pressure transducer. Via a fluid filled polyethylene catheter, inserted in the jugular vein, potassium chloride (KCl: 0.08 m g/kg) was administered and subse- quently CA induced. CA was defined as a mean arterial pressure (MAP) ofless than 20 mmHg and no ECG activity and lasted for 8 min. Thereafter t h em i c ew e r er e s u s c i t a t e db ym a n ual chest compression (~300/min) and a 0.1 ml epinephrine (0.1 mg/ml i.v.). Resuscitation ended after15 min or upon ROSC, defined as sinus rhythm on ECG and mean arterialpressure >40 mmHg lasting at least 5 min. Results: 17 out of 21 (81 %) mice in the sevoflurane group achieved ROSC within 90 seconds after the start of resuscitation. In contrast,none of the 6 mice sedated and anesthetized with FMA achievedROSC within 15 minutes after CA. No significant differences in aortic pressure, heart rate or body temperature was observed before CA. Conclusion: Sevoflurane is the best choice for anesthetics in a mouse CA model with successful resuscitation. However, our data suggest aprofound postconditioning effect of sevoflurane which should be in- vestigated further detail. A448 Hydrochlorothiazide in Correspondence: M.C.O. van IJzendoorn - Medical Center Leeuwarden, Intensive Care, Leeuwarden, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A448 Introduction: Impaired renal sodium excretion may contribute ICU-acquired hypernatremia (IAH). Thiazides are suggested as an ef-fective treatment by interfering in renal sodium reabsorption [1]. Objectives: Primary aim of the study was to reduce serum sodium concentration (sNa) in patients with IAH, defined as sNa 143 mmol/ l, with hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) in comparison to placebo. Second-ary endpoints were a difference in urine sodium concentration (uNa) and the duration of severe IAH, defined as sNa 145 mmol/l. Methods: A monocentric, double-blind placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 50 patients with IAH and an impaired renal cation ex-cretion, defined as (urine potassium + uNa) < sNa in a spot urine sam- ple. Patients were randomized for enteral HCT 25 mg (n = 25) or placebo (n = 25) 1qd for a maximum of 7 days. Patients on renal re-placement therapy, on medications inducing diabetes insipidus orwith recent use of diuretics were excluded. The trial received no funding and was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NTC01974739). Results: Baseline characteristics in both groups were comparable. At baseline median sNa was 146 mmol/l in both groups ([145 -148] in the HCT-group, [144 -150] in the placebo group, p = 0.4). Over time sNa decreased significantly with 4 mmol/l in both groups, with no significant difference between groups. At baseline uNa was 25 [10 - 62]mmol/l in the HCT-group and 20 [10 -66]mmol/l in the placebo group. Over time uNa increased significantly in both groups: 46 [16 - 86]mmol/l in the HCT-group and 36 [9 -78]mmol/l in the placebo group, with no difference between groups (Fig. 17, Table 7). Median duration of sNa 145 mmol/l was 3 days in both groups (p = 0.91). No adverse advents or side effects were registered.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 231 of 607Conclusions: HCT 25 1qd did not significantly affect sNa nor uNa in patients with IAH.

Rulisek - 1st Medical Faculty, Charles University, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Prague, Czech Republic Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A449 Introduction: Most of mass methanol outbreaks are reported in underdeveloped countries were financial resources are scarce. In The Czech Republic, in 2012 -2013 the mass methanol outbreak was re- ported with 138 victims. Finding optimal cost-effective treatment is cornerstone for every medical system. Objectives: Primary objective of our study was to define total hos- pital cost, find major parameters which influence total hospital cost and its relation to clinical outcome. Choice of antidote (ethanol or fomepizol) and choice of elimination technique (continuous orintermittent hemodialysis), its impact to hospital costs and clinical outcome were analyzed. Methods: In cooperation with Czech Toxicology Information Centre (TIC) and Czech medical insurance companies reimbursed medical costs were defined. 54 survivors fulfilled follow up investigation. Hos- pital costs and its correlation to admission parameters was provided. Effectiveness of treatment modalities and consequent medical costs were analyzed. Results: The median hospital costs were 2,422 (interquartile range, IQR: 1,364-4,748) euros. The median one-year medical 633(IQR euros. Anion gap, HCO3-, creatinine, methanol level, decreased GCS strongly correlated with total hospital costs. All non-survivors were comatose at admission. Fomepizol treatment increase adjusted hospital costs 2,8 times without difference in clinical outcome. Choice of intermittent hemodialysis led to faster residual metha- nol clearance, formic acid c learance and showed trend to decreased hospital costs. Conclusions: We were able to define major admission parameters that have impact to total hospital costs. Fomepizol antidote signifi- cantly increases costs without impact to clinical outcome. Intermit- tent hemodialysis shortens secondary elimination time and tend to lower costs.

Kim - Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Department of Pharmacy, Seongnam-si, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A450 Introduction: Few studies have evaluated the prognostic importance of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in intensive care unit (ICU) pa- tients because there are many confounding conditions such as sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and low thrombocytopenia level when admitted to the ICU. Objectives: We determined the prevalence and risk factors of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in the ICU. Methods: Patients treated with linezolid from January 2005 to December 2015 in the ICU were reviewed retrospectively. To differ- entiate other causes of thrombocytopenia, the Naranjo algorithm was used to determine the degree of probability for every linezolid- induced thrombocytopenia. Results: Sixty patients were included in this study. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 69.8 (\u00b111.9) years. Twenty-nine patients (48.3 %) presented linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia. Patients with thrombocytopenia had higher incidence of any malignancy (41.4 % vs. 9.7 % p = 0.007), elevated baseline creatinine (1.7 [0.9-2.5] vs. 0.9 [0.6-1.3], median [IQR] mg/dL, p = 0.042) and lowered platelet on the first day of linezolid administration (160 [128 -230] vs. 194 [118 -285] [IQR], p 0.296). Patients who developed thrombocytopenia received more transfusions (34.5 % vs. 6.5 %, p = 0.009) and showed increased ICU mortality (62.1 % vs. 32.3 %, p = 0.037). By means of a logistic regression model, higher incidence of any malignancy (odds ratio, 9.060, 95 % confidence interval, 1.942-42.271) and elevated serum cre- atinine level after linezolid administration (odds ratio, 1.655, 95 % confidence interval, 1.027-2.669) were significant risk factors of linezolid-induced thrombocytopenia in the ICU.

Cioccari - Austin Health, University of Melbourne, Department of Intensive Care, Heidelberg, Australia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A451 Introduction: Intravenous boluses of furosemide are commonly given to critically ill patients to modulate fluid balance1-3. However, their effect on urinary output (UO), fluid balance, electrolyte losses andhemodynamics has not been systematically studied. Therefore, we sought to compare UO, fluid balance, electrolyte losses, biochemical, and hemodynamic effects in the six hours before and after the ad-ministration of a 40 mg IV bolus of furosemide.Methods: We conducted a prospective observational study in critically ill patients where the attending clin ician had decided to administer a 40 mg bolus of IV furosemide. We collected information on period with the 6-hour post-bolus period. We performed linear regression analysis to identify predictors of th e extent of urinary output response. Results: We studied 24 patients (13 females) with a median (IQR) age of 72 (64, 81) years. The intravenous bolus induced a > 1000 ml in- crease in urine output (UO) in 6 (25 %) patients, a 500 -1000 ml in- crease in 7 (29.2 %) patients, a < 500 ml increase in 9 (37.5 %)patients, and no increase in 2 (8.3 %) patients. The median UO in-creased in 23 (96 %) patients and failed to increase in 1 (4 %) patient for a median difference in UO of 561 (250, 1046) ml. The 6-hour fluid balance became negative in 16 (72.7 %) patients and positive in 8(36.3 %) patients, with a median change of 520 ( 1206, 98) ml. However, we observed no difference in free water clearance. Fur- osemide significantly increased urinary sodium, potassium and chlor- ide losses by 67 (31, 129) mmol, 9.4 (1.8, 18) mmol and 61 (44, 138)mmol respectively, and decreased blood chloride levels by 1.5 (0.5,3.0) mmol/l. There were no detectable changes in hemodynamics.On linear regression analysis, UO increased by 37 ml (95 % CI 19 to 56 ml) / 6 hour for every 1 mmHg increase in mean arterial pressure and decreased by 35 ml (95 % CI 9 to 61 ml) / 6 hour for every 1 g/Lincrease in serum albumin.Conclusions: We defined the overall median effect of furosemide on urine output, urinary sodium, potassium and chloride losses and fluid balance in critically ill patients and provided information on howsuch effects were modulated by mean arterial pressure and albuminlevels. Our findings are likely to assist clinicians in their therapeutic expectations and choices. References 1. Bagshaw SM, Delaney A, Jones D, et al.

Forsberg3,4 1TioHundra AB, Norrt\u00e4lje, Sweden;2Swedish Poisons Information Centre, Sweden;3Department Clinical Science and Education, S\u00f6dersjukhuset, Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, AB, M. Forsberg - TioHundra AB, Norrt\u00e4lje, Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A452 Introduction: In 1998, Weinberg and colleagues reported results from a study that pointed towards reduced bupivacaine toxicity byintravenous lipid emulsion (ILE) in rats[1]. The use of ILE as an anti- dote has increased dramatically and associations in several countries have launched guidelines regarding the use of ILE in local anaes-thetic systemic toxicity (LAST). Recently, two systematic reviews fromthe international expert team 'Lipid Emulsion Therapy Workgroup' were published[2,3]. The review on ILE for LAST concluded that treat- ment appears to be effective in some cases of LAST, but there is noevidence showing that ILE is more effective than vasopressors. Thereview on ILE for non-local anaesthetic toxicity concluded that the quality of evidence for ILE being an effective antidote remains low to very low.Objectives: We present a systematic review including all published reports regarding humans treated with lipid rescue from 1998 until 2016. Methods: Web of science and PubMed were used for the literature search. To limit the search we used predefined criteria. This resultedin 195 papers, which were independently reviewed and categorized by using a modified version of WHO-UMC causality categories[4]. This is a 6-graded assessment scale that combines clinical and pharmaco-logical aspects with the quality of documentation. Grade 1 implies acertain causal connection, 2 probable, 3 possible and 4 unlikely. Grade 5 implies none or negative effect of ILE and 6 unassessable. Log p-values were identified for all involved toxins. Further, thereviewing experts evaluated which main symptom reasonable hadled to the decision of giving ILE. Results: In total, 135 case reports received grade 1 -4 and 34 grade 5. Forty of the 135 case reports that had reported a positive effect ofILE were parenteral intoxications while 95 were oral poisonings.Three of 135 cases were classified as a certain correlation betweenIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 233 of 607giving ILE and improvement of symptoms, 34 cases as probable cor- relation, 71 possible and 27 unlikely. Mean classification grade in par- enteral intoxications was 2.3. Mean classification grade among theoral poisonings was 3.1, which was a highly significant difference.None of the oral poisonings received the classification grade 'certain'. The parenteral intoxications had a mean log p-value of 4.2 which was significantly higher than that for oral poisonings which was 3.2.Indications for ILE in parenteral intoxications were cardiac arrest andneurological symptoms and for oral poisonings hypotension and arrhythmia. Conclusions: The evidence for ILE being an effective antidote is sparse. Thirty-four out of 135 published cases indicates no or nega-tive effect, despite the immense impact of publication bias. It seems reasonable not to use ILE in oral poisonings.

Fondaparinux is a safety treatment of HIT, even though is not recommended in acute renal failure (ARF) because of it renal elimination and significant risk of accumulation.Objectives: Report the safety profile and efficacy of fondaparinux (thrombotic and major bleeding complications) in patients with HIT and ARF during continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). Methods: We reviewed consecutive elegible patients with HIT and ARF in one medical university center (Cl\u00ednica Universidad de Navarra)over a 5 year period, who received fondaparinux for anticoagulation at the time of the HIT diagnosis. Results:- Of the 12 patients recorded that received fondaparinux as anticoa-gulation therapy, 5 of them shared the criteria of HIT and ARF with CRRT. We analyzed four of the five patients, excluding one because of loss of information.- The mean age of the patients was 67 yo, three men and onewoman. All of them present acute renal failure with a mean basal creatinine of 2.57, meeting the criteria of CRRT. - All patients had cardiac surgery with heparin administration lastmore than 24 hrs with a mean of 4.5 days.- Platelets at admission were documented and in all cases they dropped more than 50 % of the original value. - After the administration of Fondaparinux, all the patients had a re-covery of the platelet count until the basal value, with a mean of28.25 days. - None of the patients developed new, recurrent or progressive thrombosis. No major bleeding complications were documented.Conclusions: Fondaparinux is a safety alternative of anticoagulation therapy in patients with HIT and ARF during continuos renal replace- ment therapy.References - Yasser Sakr, Crit Care.2011; 15:211 Honore et al.

Vital signs, clinical data, toxi- cological results, time prior to ICU admission and mortality at discharge from ICU were recorded. Only tympanic temperatures were considered.SAPS-3 and daily SOFA scores were calculated. Hyperthermia was set asa tympanic temperature above 38,9 \u00b0C. MODS was defined by the pres- ence of a score of 3 or 4 in at least two items of the SOFA scale, exclud- ing the neurological at 48 hour of admission or at the time of death.Results: Forty patients were identified after excluding three accord- ing to pre-established criteria. They were predominantly young (26 years (19 -41)) male (33 patients) with no previous medical his- tory (33 patients). The co-use of other substances was common. Themain cause of admission was altered level of consciousness (35 pa-tients), 25 (62.5 %) were in coma. Four cases were admitted due to an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Seventeen patients (42.5 %) pre- sented hyperthermia, of which eleven had MODS (4 died within thefirst 24 hours). No patient with a maximum temperature below 39 \u00b0Cdeveloped MODS. Six patients with hyperthermia (35.2 %) had a fa- vorable outcome without MODS. Among them, the maximum temperature (40.62 \u00b1 0,7 vs 80,7 \u00b1 3, p < 0,001) and SOFA scores (6 (0 -9) vs 10 (6 -19), p 0,001 at 24 hours; 2 (0 -8) vs 15 (13 -17), p 0,003 at 48 hours) were significantly lower. No differences in origin (e.g. club), co-use of othersubstances or temperature control measures were observed amongthis group. There was a trend toward a greater delay in admission to ICU (176 \u00b1 77 vs 103 \u00b1 9 min, p 0.76) that was not statistically signifi- cant among this group. All patients admitted due to out-of-hospitalcardiac arrest presented with hyperthermia (41,8 \u00b1 0,5 \u00b0C) and died within the first 24 hours). Conclusions: 1. Hyperthermia appears to be strongly associated with the presence of MODS in patients with MA/MDMA intoxications.2.There is a subset of patients with hyperthermia who do not developMODS. This is not fully explainable by differences in peak temperature or in hyperthermia management.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 234 of 607A455 Double-check of IV medication at the bedside; does it bring safety or risks?D. Winterwerp1, T. van Galen2 1RN ICU Nurse, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands; 2ICU Nursing staff manager, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, NetherlandsCorrespondence: D. Winterwerp - RN ICU Nurse, VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A455 Introduction: The Dutch Healthcare Inspectorate and Quality Insti- tutes mandated hospitals to perform a double-check during IV medi- cation preparation and administering at the bedside. Double check during IV med. preparation was already secured into the workflow.The bedside check is an addition to the nursing workload. The ICUnursing staff of VU University medical center (VUmc) is concerned that the bedside check will not be as effective as expected and that implementing this double check will generate disturbances in otherICU processes.Objectives: Perform a workload measurement during 4 ICU shifts. Perform a literature study and survey other ICU's. Interview with the dedicated ICU pharmacist.Methods: The workload measurement was performed to clarify how much extra time the bedside check added to the normal nursing task performance. We measured the frequency and time of the bedside check. The literature study was performed to find evidence of experi-ences and potential problems with the single check versus doublecheck. Interviewing the pharmacist was to inquire the concerning double checks as well as supporting advice. Results: The workload measurement has been performed during four 8-hour shifts. There were 9 to 12 patients admitted at the ICU duringthese shifts. The N/P ratio was 1:1.5 up to 2.0. The additional check takes 1,5 min. per patient, this is added to the 2 minutes that the IV med. preparation check already takes. The bedside check added 27interruptions to the 15 interruptions for IV med. preparation becausethe preparation check included multiple medications simultaneously and the bedside check 1 of 2 IV meds per moment. There are more quantitative studies then qualitative studies [1]. Moststudies conclude that more studies need to be conducted [2].Other Dutch hospitals struggle with the same problem. Some hospi- tals enlarged pharmacy service to prepare more medication to de- crease nurse's workload.Discussion: Evaluating double check workload, it was less time con- suming then expected although the frequency of the check brings more interruptions. Every interruption brings a disturbance to nurse's concentration and work, this could potentially increase patient risk.Therefore the amount of interruptions should be reduced to a mini-mum. Meanwhile, technology makes giant leaps. This has the poten- tial to replace the double check. BCMA is making progress and is more efficient and foul proof than human checks. Because of thewide spread variety in results its hard to draw further Conclusions: Itis even doubtful whether further studies make sense, given the current advances in technology. If available, BCMA technique (com- bined with CPOE) should be implemented as soon as possible. If notavailable, than hospitals should focus on a select part of medicationchecking based on specific risks and workflow [3]. References 1.

Vazin - Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Clinical Pharmacy Department, Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A456 Introduction: Inadequate antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial in- fections is an independent determinant of mortality in the critically ill patient. Multi-drug resistant Gram-negative bacilli, mainly Acineto- bacter species, are responsible for a significant proportion of nosoco-mial infections. Acinetobacter has been found to be resistant tomany currently available antimicrobial agents. Recently there has been renewed interest in colistin, which had earlier been abandoned for serious adverse effects.Objectives: To assess rational colistin use in a prospective study at the ICU wards of a university affiliated hospital in Iran Methods: Standard treatment Guideline for colistin use were pro- vided and approved by pharmacy and therapeutics committeeand Study criteria were developed to assess the several parame-ters involved in colistin therapy. These parameters include the appropriateness of indication, dosing regimen, duration of ther- apy and monitoring for toxicity. Clinical and paraclinical parame-ters such as Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR), microbial culture,antibacterial sensitivity, WBC count and fever were collected and recorded for analysis. Results: One hundred patients were enrolled in this study, including 64 male and 36 female patients. In most of patients(97 %), the originof infection was hospital acquired.In this study colistin therapy was 87 % specific, in the remaining 13 %, the initial therapy with colistin was empirical. The most frequent infection was ventilator associatedpneumonia (69 %). None of the patients received loading dose. Themaintenance dose of colistin in 76 %, dosing interval in 71 %, and duration of treatment in 84 %, was appropriate. In this study, 68.12 % of colistin use was compatible with standard treatmentguideline.Conclusions: Based on the results of this study,the main observed drawbacks were inappropriate dosing regimen,especially not consid- ering loading dose in life threatening infections, inappropriate main-tenance dose, and continuation of colistin, which has to be revisedin order to achieve an effective treatment.

Methods: The patients admitted to intensive care unit (ICU) with in- toxication between April 2010-May 2015 were evaluated retrospect-ively and 18 pregnant intoxication cases were achieved.Results: Median age was 29 (22 -40). Median pregnancy week was 15.5 (5 -32). Eleven (61.1 %) patients were multi drug intoxication, 5 (27.8 %) patients were carbon monoxide (CO) intoxication and 2 pa-tients were mushroom intoxication. The drugs that were taken inorder to commit suicide were mostly antidepressants, antibiotics and analgesics. Median duration of stay in ICU was 1.5 (1 -5) days. Median Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) was 15 (14 -15). Additional comorbid dis- eases were positive in 4 (22.2 %) patients. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy(HBOT) was applied to all patients with CO intoxication. Median ap- plication number of HBOT was 1 (1 -3). Activated carbon, proton pump inhibitors for gastric protection and medical treatment weregiven to all patients with multi drug intoxication. The 2 patients withmushroom intoxication received only symptomatic treatment. When we compare the pre and post treatment AST, ALT and CK values of the patients with multi drug intoxication there were significant de-crease. But, there were no differences between troponin values. In thepatients with CO intoxication there were no significant differences be- tween the pre and post treatment carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) values (Table 8). All patients were discharged with healing. Seventeen of the patientshad no problem related with their pregnancy and they gave birth at term (37 -38 weeks). All babies were healthy at birth and they did not have any problem associated with intoxication. One of the patientsended her pregnancy with her own decision in her early pregnancy.Conclusions: In conclusion, we did not observe any severe complica- tion in clinically stable intoxication patients with normal laboratory findings in their pregnancy. A458 Alcohol-related major traumatic brain injury: 1Dalhousie Sciences Centre, Division of Neurosurgery, Halifax, Canada;2Dalhousie University, Critical Care, Halifax, Correspondence: R.S. Green - Dalhousie University, Critical Care, Halifax, Canada Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A458Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of death and disability. In the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, TBI occurs in approximately 50 % of major trauma seen annually. Although alcoholuse increases the risk of experiencing TBI, it remains unclear whetheroutcomes in alcohol-impaired TBI patients are different from those of unimpaired patients. Objectives: The objective of this study was to describe the character- istics and patterns of major TBI seen over a 14-year period at theprovincial level in Canada. We evaluated the effect of alcohol on length of stay (LOS) and mortality in patients with major TBI. Methods: This was a retrospective case series. Data were obtained from the Nova Scotia Trauma Registry for all patients presenting withmajor TBI (abbreviated injury score [AIS] head 3) in Nova Scotia hos- pitals between 2002 and 2015. Injury rates were calculated on the basis of 100,000 population using population estimates from Statis-tics Canada. Patients were compared by blood alcohol concentration(BAC) at time of injury: negative (0 -1.9 mmol/L), low (2 -21 mmol/L), and moderate/high ( 22 mmol/L). A logistic regression model was constructed to test for outcomes and adjusted for the effects of age,gender, location, injury severity score (ISS), maximum AIS head, andBAC level. Results: Overall, 4518 major TBI patients were seen in provincial hos- pitals during the study period. The mean age of TBI patients was 51\u00b1 25 years; 72 % were male. The majority of injuries were the resultof blunt trauma (93 %), with relatively few major TBIs resulting from penetrating trauma (7 %). The most common mechanisms of injury were falls (46 %) and motor vehicle crashes (27 %). Analysis ofcensus-based subpopulations demonstrated that injury rates variedsignificantly by geography (from 25 to 65 TBIs per 100,000 popula- tion). Testing for alcohol was performed in 43 % of cases. Patients who were tested for alcohol tended to be male (79 %) and middle-aged (mean age 44 \u00b1 20 years). A positive BAC (i.e., 2 mmol/L) was found in 47 % of patients who were tested. Mean acute LOS was similar for all three BAC groups. Mortality was independently pre- dicted by increasing age (odds ratio [OR] = 1.01; p < 0.001), male gen-der (OR = 1.30; p = 0.049), an ISS between 16 and 75 (OR = 2.67; p <0.001), a maximum AIS head of 5 or 6 (OR = 3.21; p < 0.001), injuries occurring outside of the capital city of Halifax (OR = 1.70; p < 0.001), and having a lower BAC level (OR = 0.99; p < 0.001).Conclusions: The results of this study show significant regional vari- ation in major TBI rates in the province of Nova Scotia. Our findings suggest that low BAC levels are associated with increased mortality in major TBI patients. There are ongoing needs for prevention andintervention efforts that focus on unintentional falls and motor ve-hicle crashes, especially in older adults. Further study is warranted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of alcohol on out- comes in patients with major TBI.

Oxidativestress is known to play a pivotal role in the intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR). Objectives: Therefore we studied the effect of different pretreatment regimens with NAC on the IIR injury in rats.Methods: Thirty-five male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to 5 groups. In group SHAM only laparotomy was performed. GroupTable 8 (abstract A457). Comparison between pre and post treatment Pretreatment Posttreatment p Mean (Range) NSIntensive Page 236 of 607CONTROL underwent IIR without NAC. In the other groups, NAC was administered intraperitoneally with different regimens: 150 150 mg/kg 5 min before reperfusion(NAC150 + 150). Measurements in tissues and blood were conducted at 4 hours of reperfusion following exsanguination. Results: Histological score of the liver was significantly improved in NAC300 compared with control (1.7 \u00b1 0.5 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 1.1 respectively, p= 0.05). In addition, NAC treatment significantly reduced liver trans- aminases in all groups of treatment, mostly in group NAC300. Plasma malondialdehyde levels were lower with NAC treatment, althoughnot statistically significantly. Lung glutathione peroxidase was signifi-cantly increased in group NAC300 (p = 0.04), while the other oxida- tion biomarkers showed no significant differences. Conclusions: NAC exerts a significant protective role in liver injury following IIR, which seems to be independent of an intestinal pro-tective effect. Additional administration of NAC before reperfusion was of no further benefit. The most effective regimen among the compared regimens was that of 300 mg/kg before ischemia.Keywords: intestinal ischemia-reperfusion, n-acetylcysteine, oxidative stress, liver injury, rat model Oral Sessions: Tuesday, 4 October 2016 Abstract award winning session A460Pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia in awake hypotensive traumapatients: life saving or detrimental? K. M. Rehn, Weaver, K. Brohi, D. Lockey London's Air Ambulance, Pre-hospital Emergency Medicine, London, UKCorrespondence: K. Crewdson - London's Air Ambulance, Pre-hospital Emergency Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A460 Introduction: The benefits of pre-hospital emergency anaesthesia (PHEA) are controversial. The timing of this intervention can be a difficult decision, particularly for consciou s trauma patients with significant hypotension secondary to presumed hypovolaemia. Patients who are hypovolaemic prior to induction of anaesthesia are at risk of severe car-diovascular instability post induct ion, which may be difficult to manage. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the mortality rate for severely injured hypovolaemic trauma patients (without evidence ofmajor neurological injury) undergoing PHEA with a patient cohort withthe same physiology who were transported to hospital without PHEA. Methods: A five year retrospective database review of a physician- led pre-hospital trauma service was performed to identify trauma pa-tients who were hypotensive (systolic blood pressure < 90 mmHg) onscene with a GCS between 13 and 15 between 01/09/2009 and 31/ 08/2014. Pre-hospital records were consulted independently by two pre-hospital clinicians to determine the likelihood of hypovolaemiabased on clinical factors.The primary outcome measure was mortality, defined as death before hospital discharge. The secondary outcome measure was mortality for patients hypotensive on scene secondary to presumed hypovolaemia.Results: In total, 9480 patients were attended in the study period; 236 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these, 101 pa- tients received PHEA on scene and 135 did not. Fifteen patients who underwent PHEA on scene died (14.9 %) compared with six patients(4.4 %) in the group of patients who were not intubated on scene,p = 0.01. The unadjusted odds ratio for death using the exact logistic regression model was 3.763 (1.30-12.21) p = 0.01. This increased to 5.96 (95 % CI 1.76-20.17) p = 0.004 after adjustment for age, mechan-ism of injury and initial heart rate. Subgroup analysis identified a sta-tistically significant increase in mortality for hypovolaemic trauma patients who underwent PHEA. In the group of 101 patients anaes- thetised on scene, 58 patients (57.4 %) were considered to be hypo-volaemic prior to induction of anaesthesia, 14 died (24 %). In thegroup of 43 patients (42.6 %) intubated on scene not meeting criteria for hypovolaemia, one patient died (2 %), p = 0.003. After adjustment for age, mechanism of injury and initial heart rate the odds ratio formortality was 9.99 (95 % CI 1.69-58.98) p = 0.01.Conclusions: Our results show an association between PHEA and mortality in awake hypotensive trauma patients, which is increased when hypotension is confirmed to be due to hypovolaemia. Thisstudy supports the hypothesis that where patients are hypovolaemicand awake on scene it might, where possible, be appropriate to delay induction of anaesthesia until after hospital arrival.

We have conducted a multi-centre randomised controlled trial (RCT) compar- ing two levels of EMT. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that more intensive EMT will im- prove longer term physical outcome in the critically ill.Methods: A full trial protocol has been published2.W ec o n d u c t e da3 centre RCT between January 2012 to July 2015. Eligible patients had re- ceived at least 48 hours of invasive ventilation before recruitment. TheIntervention arm received up to 90 min per day of EMT Monday to Fri-day whilst the control arm received up to 30 min per day Monday to Friday. The primary trial outcome was the physical component of the SF-36 quality of life measure at 6 months after recruitment.Results: 308 patients were recruited (150 assigned to the intervention arm and 158 to control). The groups were well matched in terms of age, gender, pre-morbid function, illness severity, type of admission and BMI. Between enrollment and final follow-up at 6 months 94 (30.5 %) partici-pants died. Of the remaining 214 participants 116 completed andreturned the SF-36 at 6 months. Ther e was no significant difference in baseline demographics between survivors who completed the SF-36 and those who failed to respond. Full survival data were available for all par-ticipants via a national database. The total number of EMT session deliv-ered to the Intervention group was higher than the standard group (2061 v 1326) and the time delivered was correspondingly higher (456.2 v 255.8 hours in total). Physical heal th as measured by the SF-36 Physical Component score improved in both groups over the 6 month follow upperiod with no significant differe nce at 6 months (37.0 Intervention v 37.1 Control; . 3[ 6.1 to 6.7]). There was no significant difference in any of the secondary measures or in6 month mortality (Intervention 28.7 % standard 34.4 % Cox proportionalhazard ratio 1:00 [95 % CI 0.60-1.68]). Conclusions: Intensive EMT did not improve the recovery or outcome at 6 months of critically ill patients ventilated for at least 48 hours comparedto standard EMT. References 1. Hashem MD et al.

Spain;2University of Hospital Gran Canaria Negr\u00edn, Intensive Care Unit, Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A462 Objectives: To prospectively evaluate the impact of Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD) application on nosocomial infections and colonization rates after 4 years in an ICU. Methods: This study was conducted in a 30-bed-medical-surgical ICU. All consecutive patients admitted to the ICU from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2015 expected to require tracheal intub- ation > 48 hours were given SDD (SDD study group) with a enteral colistin, and in a digestive solution. Oropharyngeal and rectal swabs were obtained on admission and once weekly. We used ENVIN nosocomial infection criteria. We compared all patients admitted to ICU who acquired nosocomial ICU infections from October 1, 2010 to September 30, 2011 (non- SDD group) to the SDD study group. In both groups, categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and percentages and the continuous ones as means and standard deviations (SD) when the data followed the normal distribution or medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) when they did not. The percentages were compared using the test of chi-square test or Fisher exact test, means with the t-test and medians with the Wilcoxon test for independent samples. Those variables that showed statistical significance in the univariate analysis were introduced in a multivariate logistic regression analysis. For each one of the ac- quired infections (catheter-related and other secondary bacter- emias, pneumonia and urinary infections and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) infections) the incidences per 1000 days of expos- ure in each cohort and the corresponding relative risks were ob- tained using the Poisson regression. Statistical significance was set at p0.05. We analyzed colistin and tobramycin resistant colonization and also antibiotic consumption (Defined antibiotics Daily Doses (DDD). Results: Results are shown in Figs. 18,19and 20. There were no statistical significant differences between both groups in type of ICU admission or demographic data. Patients with SDD had significantly less Extended Spectrum Betalactamase (ESBL), Gram Negative Bacteria Multirresistant (GNB MR) and Aci- netobacter spp infections. We had also a significant reduction in nosocomial pneumonias and other secondary bacteremias and ARB rates in SDD group versus non SDD. There was no infection by Clostridium difficile. The exogenous infections were 76,08 %. Colistin resistant colonization was 14,1 % and tobramycin resist- ant colonization was 20,7 % of samples. There was a decrease on the DDD/100 ICU stays after SDD. Conclusions: After 4 years applying SDD a significant reduction of infections by ESBL, GNB MR and Acinetobacter was observed. A significant decrease of nosocomial pneumonia, secondarybacteremias and ARB infections rates was also shown. An anti- biotic consumption reduction was found after SDD. Low rates of colistin and tobramycin resistant colonization bacteria have been observed. Fig. 18 (abstract A462). Univariate analysis Fig. 19 (abstract A462).

Carteron - CHUV, Department of Intensive Care Medicine, Neuroscience Critical Care Research Group, Lausanne, Switzerland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A463 Introduction: Lactate supports cerebral vasodilation. Hypertonic lactate (HL) solutions are emerging as a therapeutic alternative after acute brain injury how- ever their effect following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) is unknown. Methods: We prospectively studied critically ill SAH patients (n = 7, age 64 \u00b1 6 years) monitored with cerebral microdialysis (CMD) and transcranial Doppler (TCD) who were resuscitated according to current guidelines and had no intracranial hypertension (clinicaltrial.- gov NCT01573507). Intervention consisted of a 3-h infusion of HL (30mol/kg/min, administered within 48 h from SAH, to achieve blood arterial lactate 4-5 mmol/L). Endpoints were the effect of HL on cerebral energy metabolism (using hourly CMD concentrations of lactate, pyruvate and glucose) and brain perfusion (using hourly TCD measurement of middle cerebral artery cerebral blood flow velocities, MCBFV). Results: Treatment with HL was associated with a significant increase of cerebral extracellular lactate (3.6 \u00b1 \u00b1 0.2 vs. 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 mmol/L; all p< 0.01, paired ttest for comparisons between baseline and peak values during HL). HL therapy was also associ- ated 83 \u00b1 13 mmHg) PbtO 2(20 \u00b1 7 vs. 20 \u00b1 7 mmHg) did not change significantly. Conclusions: Our findings show that HL administered during the early post-injury phase following SAH improves brain energy metab- olism by exerting a beneficial cerebral glucose sparing effect. HL also increases brain perfusion, which seems independent from cerebral perfusion pressure and PbtO 2, and appears related to cerebral extra- cellular lactate supplementation. These preliminary data supportlarger studies to examine the value of HL solutions in patients with SAH and other forms of acute cerebrovascular diseases.

Wollersheim - Charit\u00e9 - Universitaetsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A464 Introduction: Intensive care unit acquired weakness (ICUAW) is a se- vere complication of critical illness. ICUAW is associated with muscle wasting, muscle weakness, respiratory failure as well as increased morbidity and mortality and features massive skeletal muscle atrophy by destruction of the contractile myosin elements. No specific treat- ment has been established. Objectives: Aim of the study was to investigate if protocol-based physiotherapy (pPT) or pPT with additional evoked muscle contrac- tion by electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) are more effective to pre- vent skeletal muscle atrophy in critically ill patients when compared to standard physiotherapy (sPT). Methods: A randomized clinical trial was performed. Participants (inclusion criterion: SOFA score 9) were randomly split into 2 groups, either treated started at the day of admission with sole pPT or pPT with EMS daily. Data of patients treated with standard physiotherapy (sPT) were available from an earlier trial[1]. An open surgical muscle biopsy from the musculus vastus lateralis was ob- tained at median day 15 of critical illness. Histological examination of muscle biopsies and quantification of myocyte cross-sectional area (MCSA) for type I, IIa, and IIb fibers using ImageJ software (fiber count > 100 per patient) were performed after applying the toluidine blue ATPase Method: Non-parametric (Charit\u00e9 EA 2/041/10). Results: 39 critical ill patients were enrolled in this final analysis (19sPT, 11pPT, 9 pPT + EMS). There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and fiber type distribution between the groups. The MCSA for all fiber types of patients with pPT with or without additional EMS were larger than the MCSA of patients with sPT. Compared to pPT alone, additional evoked muscle activation by EMS increases MCSA for type I,IIa and IIb muscle fibers. Data are shown as frequency-distribution histograms. Conclusions: For the first time we show that pPT is associated with reduced skeletal muscle atrophy when compared to sPT. EMS re- sulted in an additional reduction of muscle atrophy. The histological findings showed reduced muscle atrophy through preventive physio- therapy procedures. Further studies are needed to solidify our find- ings and to analyze if this reduction in atrophic response can be confirmed on molecular (i.e. analysis of myosin heavy chain, protein homeostasis) and functional levels and improves the long-term out- come of critical ill patients.

L. Ense\u00f1at1, A. P\u00e9rez-Madrigal1, Fernando Fonseca, Servi\u00e7o Barcelona, Critical Care Department, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A465 Objective: Central venous-to-arterial carbon dioxide difference (PcvaCO2) demonstrated its prognostic value in critically ill pa- tients suffering from shock, and current expert recommendations ad- vocate for further resuscitation interventions when P cvaCO2is elevated. P cvaCO2combination with arterial-venous oxygen content difference (P cvaCO2/CavO2) seems to enhance its performance when assessing anaerobic metabolism. However, the fact that PCO 2values might be altered by changes in blood O 2content (the Haldane ef- fect), has been presented as a limitation of PCO 2-derived variables. The present study aimed at exploring the impact of the Haldane ef- fect on P cvaCO2and P cvaCO2/CavO2during the early phase of shock. Methods: Prospective interventional study. Ventilated patients suffer- ing from shock within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Patients re- quiring FiO 20.5 were excluded. At inclusion, simultaneous arterial and central venous blood samples were collected. Patients under- went ahyperoxygenation test (5 minutes of FiO 2100 %), and arterialand central venous blood samples were repeated. Oxygenation and CO2variables were calculated at both timepoints. Results: Twenty patients were studied. The main cause of shock was septic shock (70 %). The hyperoxygenation trial increased oxygen- ation parameters in arterial and venous blood, whereas PCO 2only changed at the venous site. Resulting P cvaCO2and P cvaCO2/CavO2- significantly increased (6.8 (4.9, 8.1) vs 7.6 (6.7, 8.5) mmHg, p 0.001; and 1.9 (1.4, 2.2) vs 2.3 (1.8, 3), p < 0.001, respectively). Baseline PcvaCO2,PcvaCO2/CavO2and S cvO2correlated with the magnitude of PO2augmentation at the venous site within the trial(rho 0.46, p 0.04; rho 0.6, p < 0.01; andrho p < 0.001, respectively). In- creased P cvaCO 2/CavO2values were associated with higher mortal- ity in our sample (1.46 (1.21, 1.89) survivorsvs2.23 (1.86, 2.8) non-survivors, p P cvaCO2/CavO2are influenced by oxygen- ation changes not related to flow. Elevated P cvaCO2and P cvaCO2/ CavO2values might not only derive from cardiac output inadequacy, but also from venous hyperoxia. Elevated P cvaCO2/CavO2values were associated with higher PO 2transmission to the venous compartment, suggesting higher shunting phenomena. Rather than a limitation, the contribution of the Haldane effect to CO 2-derived variables might represent an additional marker of severity of shock. References 1.- Mesquida J, et al.

W. Huber, M. Eckmann, F. Elkmann, A. Gruber, T. Lahmer, U. Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen, II. Medizinische Klinik, output CO, global end-diastolic volume GEDV and extravascular lung water EVLW. To facilitate interpretation of these data several ratios have been developed, including pulmon- ary vascular permeability index (defined as EVLW/(0.25*GEDV)) and global ejection fraction ((4*stroke volume)/GEDV). PVPI and GEF have been associated to the aetiology of pulmonary oedema and to sys- tolic cardiac function, respectively. However, several studies showed that the use of femoral venous access results in a marked overesti- mation of GEDV which also falsely reduces PVPI and GEF. One of these studies suggested a correction formula for femoral venous ac- cess that markedly reduces the bias for GEDV (1). Consequently, the last PiCCO-algorithm requires information about the CVC, and correc- tion for femoral access has been shown. However, two recent studies demonstrated inconsistencies of this algorithm using incorrected GEDV for PVPI (2), but corrected GEDV for GEF. Nevertheless, these studies were based on mathematical analysis of data displayed by the PiCCO in a total of 15 patients equipped with only a femoral , but not with a jugular CVC. Objectives: PVPI_fem and GEF_fem derived from fem- oral TPTD to values derived from jugular indicator injection in 25 pa- tients with both jugular femoral CVCs. Methods: 54 datasets in 25 patients CVC were recorded. Each dataset consisted of three triplicate TPTDs using the jugular venous access as the gold standard, while the the femoral access with (PVPI_fem_cor) and without (PVPI_fem_uncor) information about the femoral Fig. 21 (abstract A464).

This is explained by the finding that PVPI_fem_uncor was not different toPVPI_fem_cor (1.48 \u00b1 0.47 vs. to m_uncor was than \u00b1 % vs. 25.0 \u00b1 6.1 %; p < 0.001). By contrast, GEF_fem_cor was not different toGEF_jug (25.6 \u00b1 % vs. 25.0 \u00b1 6.1 %; Furthermore, GEF_fem_-cor was significantly higher than GEF_fem_uncor (25.6 \u00b1 5.8 % vs. 20.6 \u00b1 5.1 %; p < 0.001). This emphasizes that an appropriate correc- tion for femoral CVC is applied to in signifi- cantly for PVPI and GEF. While the last PiCCO algorithm appropriately corrects for GEF, the correction is not applied to PVPI. This results in substantial underestimation of PVPI. References 1.

Mukhtar3 1Cairo University Medical School, Intensive Care Department, Cairo, Egypt;2Faculty of Medicine, Fayoum University, Intensive Care Department, Fayoum, Egypt;3Cairo University Medical School, Intensive care Department, Cairo, EgyptCorrespondence: W. Ayoub - Cairo University Medical School, Intensive Care Department, Cairo, Egypt Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A467 Introduction: Prediction of fluid responsiveness in hemodynamically unstable patients with spontaneous breathing activity has been a clin- ical challenge. It has been best assessed by passive leg raising test. Pre-ejection period, the time from the onset of ventricular depolarization tothe beginning of left ventricular ejection, is a systolic time interval found to decrease with greater preload 1. The effect of passive leg rais- ing test on the pre-ejection period has not been studied in this context.Objectives: Our objective was to test whether fluid responsiveness could be predicted by the response of pre-ejection period to passive leg raising test. We also examined whether baseline end expiratory inferior vena cava diameter could predict fluid responsiveness in thiscategory of patients.Methods: Thirty patients with spontaneous breathing activity consid- ered for fluid loading were included. We used transthoracic echocar- diography to measure stroke volume, and pre-ejection period beforeand during passive leg raising test as well as before and after fluidloading (500 ml saline 0.9 % over 15 minutes). An increase in stroke volume of 15 % or more after volume expansion defined fluid re- sponders. We also measured baseline end expiratory inferior venacava diameter obtained from the subcostal window.Results: 19 patients were responders (63.3 %). Passive leg raising test induced-changes in stroke volume of 9.3 % predicted fluid respon- siveness with a sensitivity of 100 % and specificity of 81.8 %, the areaunder receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0.96; 95 %confidence interval (CI) [0.91,1.0], meanwhile, passive leg raising test- induced changes in pre-ejection period of 5.0 % predicted fluid responsiveness with a sensitivity of 94.7 % and a specificity of45.5 %, the AUC was 0.62; 95 % CI [0.4,0.85]. Baseline inferior venacava diameter (in cm) failed to identify responders vs. non- responders (1.20 \u00b1 0.37 vs 1.38 \u00b1 0.51 respectively, p = 0.36). Conclusions: In hemodynamically unstabl e patients with spontaneous breathing activity, passive leg raising test-induced increase in stroke vol- ume of 9.3 % accurately predicted fluid responsiveness, while passiveleg raising test-induced decr ease in pre-ejection period of 5.0 % was sensitive, but not specific in the prediction of fluid responsiveness. Base- line inferior vena cava diameter failed to identify fluid responders. References 1- Weissler AM. Current concepts in cardiology. Systolic-time intervals.

Hospital Erasme, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Critical Care, Brussels, Belgium Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A468 Introduction: Persistent signs of skin hypoperfusion after resuscitation in patients with shock are associated with worse outcomes, but assess-ment is rather subjective. Skin laser Doppler (SLD) techniques allow skinblood flow (SBF) to be measured more objectively and non-invasively. Objective: To measure SBF at the extremities using a SLD technique in patients with shock and to determine if they are correlated to pa-tients outcomes.Method: SBF was evaluated in the toe perfusion units) using a SLD (PeriFlux System 5000, Perimed, Sweden) at basal skin temperature and after warming to 37 \u00b0C in 28 consecutive pa-tients admitted with circulatory shock (need for vasoactive agents tomaintain MAP > 60 mmHg) on ICU admission and 10 healthy volun- teers. Organ dysfunction was assessed using the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Statistical analysis was performedusing STATA 13.0. The area under the receiver operating curve (AUC)was calculated to identify the predictive performance of SBF. Results are presented as median (p25-75) values. Result: Global ICU mortality was 32 %. Demographic data and SBF are shown in Table 9. The AUCs for prediction of mortality at basal temperature were 0.77 (0.58-0.97) and 0.65 (0.47-0.92) for the finger- tip and toe respectively and 0.71 (0.51-0.93) for the SOFA score. Conclusion: Measurements of SLD at fingertip and toe may represent an interesting monitoring technique for shock patients. Their prog-nostic value is similar to SOFA score. Table 9 (abstract A468).

Center Anaesthesiology Hamburg, Germany; University Medical Center Hamburg- Eppendorf, Center of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine,Hamburg, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A469 Introduction: Investigating the use of dynamic haemodynamic parameters, such as pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (SVV), for predicting fluid responsiveness prior to volume expansion has led many scientific discussions lately.Also, according to current consensus statements their use isincreasingly recommended in suitable patients [1]. Extended hemodynamic monitoring (EHD) beyond measurement of cardiac filling pressures (central venous pressure, pulmonary artery occlu-sion pressure) is still rare. A recent study revealed that only aminor part of critical ill patients are supervised with specific monitoring to assess fluid responsiveness [2]. It remains unclear if this is due to lacking availability of the specialised devices or thelimitations of the use of automated functional parameters ofpreload. Objectives: This analysis was designed to assess the availability of monitoring, the clinical suitability of using PPV or SVV, and if andhow they are actually used in German, Swiss, and Austrian ICU\u00b4s.Methods: This is a sub-analysis of the ICU-CardioMan Trial. For this multicentre, one day cross-sectional study data regarding patients' hemodynamic monitoring was collected from 161 participating ICUsfrom Germany, Switzerland and Austria by means of a web-basedcase report form. The ICUs gave detailed information on availability of EHD in general and provided data from 1789 patients concerning monitoring, as well as information on the patients' specific character-istics that have impact on treatment suitability of PPV and SVV topredict fluid responsiveness. Results: EHD was widely available throughout the examined ICUs. Only a minority of patients was reported to be monitored withEHD during the study period (see Table 11). In the group of the patients that needed catecholamines and/or vasopressors (39.2 %) the share of patients monitored with EHD was signifi- cantly higher. In this subgroup, 66.8 % of those patients hadsinus or pacer rhythm. Of this portion another 30.9 % weremechanically ventilated in a controlled mode. Conclusions: Though widely available EHD to predict fluid respon- siveness is still not comprehensively implemented in daily clinicalroutine. Over one third of patients that required catecholamines/ va- sopressors fulfilled the criteria for assessment of PPV or SVV. The high share of patients not fulfilling the criteria for using PPV and SVVstresses the need for further development of functional parametersof preload operating independently from the presence of controlled mechanical ventilation.

We evaluated whether reconnection tomechanical ventilation for one hour after the effort of a spontaneousbreathing trial could reduce extubation failure in critically ill patients. Objectives: reconnection to mechanical ventilation for one hour after the effort of a spontaneous breathing trial could reduce extubationfailure in critically ill patients.Methods: In this prospective, randomized, multicenter trial, patients who successfully completed a spontaneous breathing trial were ran- domized to direct extubation (Control group) or reconnection to theventilator for a one-hour rest before extubation (Rest group). Statis-tical analysis included multivariable logistic regression models for extubation failure. Results: We randomized 243 patients to the Control group and 227 patients to the Rest group.

Extubation failure within 48 hours after extubation was morecommon in the Control than in the Rest group (58 (23.9 %) vs. 24 (10.6 %) patients; p < 0.001). Rescue noninvasive ventilation was ad- ministered in 47 (57 %) patients, 16 (34 %) of whom required reintu-bation. Reintubation was more common in the Control than in theRest group (35 (14 %) vs. 12 (5 %) patients; p < 0.001) mainly due to inability to manage secretions in both groups. Hospital and ICU length of stay and mortality did not differ between groups.Conclusion: One-hour rest after a successful SBT reduced the rates of extubation failure within 48 h after extubation and reintubation.

We wonder whether this result may be due to the wide range oftidal volume and PEEP used across the trials included (1).Objectives: Therefore, we investigated P in two trials in which lung protective mechanical ventilation was applied to ARDS patients. Our working hypothesis is that P is a risk factor just like compliance (Crs) or Plateau pressure (Pplat) of the respiratory system are.Methods: ARDS patients included in Acurasys (2) and Proseva (3) trials were used. The first trial compared the neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) cisatracurium vs. placebo and the second the prone vs. the su-pine position. Both had near inclusion criteria (notably PaO2/FIO2 <150 mm Hg and PEEP 5 cm H2O) and similar lung protective mechan- ical ventilation (4) (in particular tidal volume 6 ml/kg predicted body weight and PEEP/FIO2 table). Both found survival benefit in the experi-mental group. SOFA, continuous NMBA infusion, prone position, com-bined use of NMBA and prone position, lactate, pH, PaCO2, PaO2/FIO2, lactate, breathing frequency, VT, PEEP, Pplat, Crs and P were recorded at day 1 after inclusion together with gender, age and SAPSII at thetime of admission and compared between survivors and nonsurvivorsat day 90. Cox proportional hazard models were used with covariates significantly different between survivors and non survivors at the threshold of 0.20 and mortality at day 90 as dependent variable. Weplanned to test colinearity between P, Crs and Pplat and, if it was veri- fied, to use a specific Cox model for each of them.Results: Both trials enrolled 805 patients of who 787 had data avail- able at day 1 of who 533 survived and 254 did not. In the univariate analysis, P averaged 13.7 \u00b1 3.7 and 12.8 \u00b1 3.7 cmH2O (P = 0.002) in nonsurvivors and survivors, respectively. Colinearity between P, Crs and Pplat was statistically significant. The Cox model for P alone is shown in Table 13.P was associated with a 5 % increased risk of mortality at each 1 cmH2O-increment.Hazard ratios (HR) were 1.05 (1.02-1.08) (P = 0.004) and 0.985 (0.972-0.999) (P = 0.023) for Pplat and Crs, respectively, in the specific ana- lyses. PEEP and VT were not significant risk factors in any model. Conclusions: When lung protective mechanical ventilation is applied P is still a significant predictor of mortality. References 1.

OBJECTIVES: To describe ventilation practice in ICU patients with- out ARDS at onset of mechanical ventilation, and to compareventilation settings and outcomes between patients at low versus high risk for ARDS. METHODS: This was an international multicenter prospective cohort of patients without ARDS undergoing invasive ventilation, conductedduring one week in 119 ICUs from 16 countries across four conti- nents. The Lung Injury Prediction Score (LIPS) was used for risk strati- fication for ARDS ( 4 [low] vs. > 4 [high]). The primary outcome wasTable 12 (abstract A471).

Secondary outcomes included comparison of ventilation settings and outcomes between patients at low versus high risk for ARDS. RESULTS: Of 3,023 patients screened in participating ICUs, 935 ful- filled inclusion criteria (Fig. 23). Tidal volume sizes, and level of posi- tive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) were 7.9 [6.8-9.1] ml/kg (PBW), and 5 [5 -7] cmH 2O, respectively. Tidal volume sizes were not different between patients with low and high risk for ARDS; PEEP level was higher in patients with high risk though differences were minimal (6 [5 -8]versus 5[ 5 -7] cm H 2O;p< 0.001) (Fig. 24). Occurrence of pulmonary complications and hos- pital mortality was higher in patients with high risk for ARDS (35.4 % vs23.4 %; p<0 . 0 0 1 a n 1 . 9 % vs15.8 %; p<0 . 0 0 1 , r e - spectively) (Fig. 25). CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of patients without ARDS at onset of mechanical ventilation received high tidal volumes. ?A3B2 show $132#?>Patients with higher risk for ARDS had higher incidence of pulmonary complications and worse clinical outcomes. These findings indicate the potential for improvement in the management of patients without ARDS. References - Determann RM, et al. Crit Care 2010;14:R1. - Esteban A, et al.

Objectives: To determine whether changes in Tdi during the early course of MV are associated with impaired liberation from MV and to further establish the links between ventilator settings, patient inspira- tory effort, changes in Tdi, and clinical outcomes. Methods: In 3 ICUs, Tdi and diaphragm thickening fraction (TF, a measure of inspiratory effort) were prospectively measured on a daily basis by ultrasound. Patients were classified according to the initial change in Tdi recorded on the first day that the change in Tdi exceeded 10 % up to MV day 7. Patient character- istics, ventilator settings, severity of illness scores and outcomes in hospital were recorded. Predicted relationships were analyzed by multivariable regression modelling and causal mediation analysis. Results: We enrolled 212 patients (outcomes available for 207). Initial changes in Tdi occurred early in the course of MV (median MV day 3, IQR 3 -5). Consistent with our previous findings (1), the rate and dir- ection of change in Tdi over time were strongly associated with TF in this cohort (p < 0.001). Controlled MV was associated with an acceler- ated decline in Tdi (p = 0.01) mediated by TF (proportion of effect mediated = 0.3, p < 0.01 for mediation effect). Both decreased and in- creased Tdi were associated with prolonged ventilator dependence (Table 12, Fig. 22, log rank p < 0.001), even after adjusting for age, se- verity of illness, sepsis, and comorbidities. Mean TF below 15 % or above 30 % over the first 3 days of MV was associated with pro- longed ventilator dependence in survivors (adjusted p = 0.02) and a higher risk of complications of acute respiratory failure (adjusted p = 0.02). The associations between mean TF and these outcomes were mediated by changes in Tdi (proportion mediated 0.44, p = 0.05, and 0.29, p = 0.02, respectively). Conclusions: Early changes in diaphragm thickness following initiation of MV are associated with marked differences in clinical outcomes. Both insufficient and excessive inspiratory effort levels are associated with prolonged ventilator dependence due in part to changes in Tdi. Titrat- ing ventilatory support to maintain TF between 15-30 % might prevent changes in Tdi and accelerate liberation from MV. References 1. Goligher EC et al.

Poitou1, Curie, UMR_S 1158 and H\u00f4pital Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, Respiratory Division and Medical ICU, Paris, France Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A474 Introduction: Breathing is a cyclic activity that is not monotonous and is therefore variable. During mechanical ventilation (MV), breath- ing variability is reduced. Breathing variability has been mostly quan- tified with two indices: the coefficient of variation (CV) that is defined as the standard deviation to the mean ratio, and the ampli- tude ratio of the spectrum's first harmonic to its zero frequency (H1/ DC). Previous reports have suggested that low variability was associ- ated with weaning failure and increased mortality. However, these studies have quantified variability either on very specific time points or on the contrary on the whole intensive care unit stay. Objectives: The aim of our study was to quantify breathing variability at the early phase of weaning according to those two indices. We further evaluated the factors associated with and the prognosis im- pact of low breathing variability. Methods: Ancillary study of a multicentre, randomized controlled trial comparing neurally ventilator adjusted assist to pressure support ventilation during the early phase of weaning. Airway flow and pres- sure were recorded during 20 minutes 12, 24, 36 and 48 hours fol- lowing inclusion. Respiratory rate, tidal volume and mean inspiratory flow were measured. Variability was assessed according to CV and H1/DC. Impact of variability on clinical outcome was determined with a Receiver Operating Characteristic. Results: 108 patients mechanically ventilated for 5 days (3 -9) were in- cluded, 72 men (68 %), aged 66 (37 -86) years, SAPS II 44 (35 -59), 62 % were mechanically ventilated for de novo hypoxemic respiratory failure. Sensitivity and specificity were plotted as functions of the ability of the CV of respiratory rate (RR), tidal volume (Vt) and mean inspiratory flow (Vt/Ti) to predict day-28 mortality. The curves intersected at a coefficient of variation of respectively 0.21 for respiratory rate, 0.16 for tidal volume and 0.14 for mean inspiratory flow (Fig. 26).Table 13 (abstract A473).

Low variability was not asso- ciated with significant difference in term of hospital and intensive care unit length of stay, ventilator free days, and duration of MV. Pul- monary gas exchanges were greater in patients with high CV-Vt (PaO 2/FiO 2= 193 (156 -241) vs 230 (183 -288), p = 0.03). No significant difference in term of gender, age, SAPS 2, Charlson score or length of MV prior to inclusion was observed with decreased variability. Conclusions: In MV patients at the early phase of weaning, low vari- ability is associated with higher mortality. Low variability is associated with worse oxygenation. Whether low variability is a causative factor of mortality or a consequence of severity remains to be determined. Therapies in neurointensive care: effects on physiology and outcomes A475 Relationship between trough haloperidol concentrations and clinical response in critically ill adults with delirium who are managed with a scheduled IV haloperidol protocol N.

However, dosing recommendations for this indication have been de- rived from older studies evaluating the use of IVH in psychiatric pa- tients [trough level H: -6 mg per day] without delirium and who are not critically ill. To establish the opti- mal dose of IVH in critically ill adults with delirium, the relationship between IVH serum concentrations and clinical response is required. Objective: To establish the relationship between serum haloperidol concentrations and clinical response in critically ill adults with delir- ium who are managed with a scheduled IVH protocol. Methods: This single-center, prospective study included consecutive crit- ically ill adults with delirium without prior exposure to haloperidol, neuro- logical or psychiatric disease, end-stage liver disease, a QTc interval 450 msec, requiring deep sedation, or requiring a medication known to interact with haloperidol. Delirium was deemed to be present when the bedside nurse and the intensivist agreed that the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) was 4 and was managed with a scheduled IVH delirium treatment protocol. IVH was initiated at 1 mg q8h (0.5 mg q 8 hi np a t i e n t s 70; 2 mg q8h if agitation present) and titrated upwards q24h by 0.5 mg q8h to 2 mg q8h based on the ICDSC score and delirium symptoms present. Trough haloperidol (TH) serum concentrations were measured on days 2 and 3 of IVH and analyzed with a validated liquid chromatography mass spectometry Method: Results: Baseline characteristics of the 14 patients enrolled were: male (64 %), mean age of 65 (SD 8), Body Mass Index (BMI) of 28 (SD 5) and a SOFA score of 7 (IQR 4 to 8) and were initiated on IVH dose as follows: 0.5 mg q8h (n = 2), 1 mg q8h (n = 10) and 2 mg q8h (n = 2). IVH dosing across day 2 and 3 of haloperidol use was similar withthe day it was initiated. The mean H dose (q8h) in the 48 h up to the TH determinations was 1.6 mg (SD 0.19). At the time of IVH initiation, the median (IQR) ICDSC score was 5 (4 to 5.3) and was relatively un- changed across day 2 [4 (3 to 5)] and day 3 [4 (3 to 5)], p = NS. The mean (SD) H serum concentration was not significantly different be- tween days 2 and 3 [2.2 (1.5) vs. 1.5 (0.9) g/L; p= 0.15]. Conclusions: This preliminary report is the first study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic response of low-dose IVH when administered to critically ill adults to treat delirium. We ob- served low trough levels of IVH and lasting delirium (for the first three days after initiation of IVH). The IVH dose that should be used to treat delirium in the ICU requires further investigation. A476 Intracranial pressure after antipyretic therapy in acute brain injury E. Picetti1, P. Ceccarelli1, Mensi1, Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A476 Introduction: Fever is a dangerous secondary insult for the injured brain (1). In a recent study (2) examining Paracetamol administration for fever control in acute brain injury (ABI) patients (pts), a reduction in intracranial pressure (ICP) was observed only in subjects with a baseline ICP > 15 mmHg. Objectives: 1) to analyze ICP trend after antipyretics administration, 2) to evaluate if ICP variations are influenced by ICP value before an- tipyretics administration. Methods: Adults pts with ABI admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were prospectively evaluated after antipyretics administration [4 time points: baseline (t-0), 30 minutes (t-30), 60 minutes (t-60) and 120 minutes (t-120)]. Inclusion criteria were: 1) monitoring of intra- arterial blood pressure, core temperature (Tc), and ICP and 2) a Tc 37.5 \u00b0C. Exclusion criteria were: 1) hypovolemia, 2) administration of drugs with hemodynamic effects during the study period, 3) adminis- tration of antipyretics in the 6 hours before the start of the study, 4) acute heart failure and 5) cerebral vasospasm. Results: 62 pts [male 6 (IQR 3 -7) at ICU admission] were enrolled. Diagnosis at ICU admission were: 33 (53,25 %) subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), 16 (25,8 brain injury (TBI), 10 (16,1 %) intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and 3 (4,8 %) acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Paracetamol (1 gr intravenous) was administered to 32 pts and Diclofenac Sodium (12,5 mg intramuscular) to 30 pts. At t-0, 34 pts (54,8 %) showed an ICP 15 and 28 (45,2 %) an ICP > 15 mmHg. No statistically significant changes in ICP were observed in the overall population after antipyretic administration: 14.9 \u00b1 5.1, and t-120 respectively (P = 0.6). A statistically significant reduction in ICP (19.5 \u00b1 3.2, 17.6 \u00b1 4.6, 16.4 t-120 respectively; P < 0.001) was observed in the group of pts with t-0 ICP > 15 mmHg. Conversely, a sta- tistically significant increase in ICP (11.2 \u00b1 2.7, 12.7 \u00b1 < 0.001) was ob- served in the group of pts with a t-0 ICP 15 mmHg. A statistically sig- nificant reduction in Tc, mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) was observed in all groups of patients (overall population and pts with ICP > or 15 mmHg) after antipyretic therapy. Conclusions: ICP variations are influenced by ICP value before antipy- retics administration. If these data are confirmed in future studies, the decision to start antipyretic therapy should take into account the baseline ICP value. References 1. Thompson HJ et Al.

The use of a continuous osmotherapy has been describedin retrospective single-center studies, but its effectiveness isdiscussed. Objectives: The first objective was to describe the association be- tween the use of a continuous osmotherapy and mortality in patientsdeveloping a post-traumatic ICH. Secondary objectives were to inves-tigate the impact of continuous osmotherapy on long-term neuro- logical recovery and on tolerance. Methods: We pooled the data from three prospective multicenter studies: the corti-TC trial (ref 1), the BI-VILI study (NCT01885507) andthe Atlanrea cohort (NCT02426255). We included all patients with traumatic brain-injury, hospitalized in ICU and receiving mechanical ventilation for more than 24 hours.ICH was defined as one or more episodes of intracranial pressurehigher than 20 mmHg and that has required a specific therapeutic intervention. In one participating center, continuous osmotherapy (NaCL20% (ref2)) was initiated as the first line treatment of intracranial hyperten-sion, and its administration was pursued up to the end of the period at risk of ICH. The primary endpoint was the survival rate at day 90. The secondaryendpoint was the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) at day 90 (GOS = 1death, GOS = 5 minor sequelae). A crude comparison of patients with ICH treated or not with continu- ous osmotherapy was first performed. To consider the biases related tothis observational study, an adjustment on potential confounders (age,glasgow coma scale, pupil reactivity, Marshall score, hypotension and hypoxemia) was performed by both a propensity analysis and a multi- variate analysis.The protocol for this study was approved by an ethics committee.Results: Among the 1054 included patients, 545 (51.7 %) devel- oped ICH. Out of 143 patients with ICH and treated with a continuousosmotherapy, 106 (74.1 %) were alive at day 90 as compared to 265(65.9 %) patients with ICH and not treated with continuous osmotherapy (p = 0.07). With the continuous osmotherapy, the rela- tive risk of survival was 1.43 (95 % CI, 0998 -2062, p = 0.05). Adjusted hazard ratio for survival at day 90 was 1.43 (95 % CI, 1.02 - 1.99, p =0.003) in propensity score-adjusted analysis and 1.67 (95%CI, 1.12- 2.50, p = 0.01) in multivariate analysis. At day 90, GOS was higher in patients treated with continousosmotherapy (64 (45.2 %) patients had a GOS = 4 -5 vs 115 (35.8 %), p = 0.01). Severe hypernatremia ( 160 mmol / l) was more frequent in treated patients (9.1 % vs 2.2 %, p < 0.001). No case of central pontine myeli-nolysis was recorded.Conclusions: Continuous osmotherapy for the treatment of post- traumatic ICH was associated with improved adjusted 90-day sur- vival.

Marzorati - University of Milan - Bicocca, School of Medicine and Surgery, Milan, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A478 Introduction: Prediction of prognosis in Intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) is always challenging: the ICH score was developed to predict outcomes and limit futile overtreatment1. Recent guidelines on ICH management have significantly modified our traditional nihilisticapproach2,3. Objectives: To compare observed and predicted 6-months mortality in a cohort of consecutive ICH patients admitted to the NeurosurgicalICU of San Gerardo Hospital (Monza, Italy) from 2013 to 2015.Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data of ICH patients with ICU length-of-stay >24 hours. We retrieved clinical data, CT scans, DNROs within 48 hours from admission, 30 days mor-tality and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) along with the ICH score and6-months survival. Results: 100 consecutive patients (64 \u00b1 14 years old, 57 % males, me- dian GCS 7 at admission, median ICH volume 75 cm 3) were included. DNRO: 28 %, all died, 71 \u00b1 11 years old, median GCS 4 at admission,median ICH volume 110 cm3. No DNRO: 72 %, 62 \u00b1 15 years old, median GCS 9 at admission, me- dian ICH volume 47 cm3(p < 0.05 vs. DNRO). Surgery was performed in 71 %.Overall, ICU mortality was lower than expected accordingly to the ICH score (see Fig. 27) (i.e. 33 %). mRS was 3 and >3 in 21 (30 %) and 46 (64 %) of the discharged patients, respectively. 180-days sur-vival globally approached 60 % (95%CI 50 -70). Considering the severity on admission: -ICH score < 3 (33 %), median length of stay in ICU of 3 days. 17 (51 %) patients underwent to neurosurgery. Mortality was non-significantly different between patients receiving neurosurgery andpatients receiving medical treatment. -ICH score 3 (67 %) had a median length of stay of 5.5 days. Neurosurgery was performed in 34 (50 %), and observed short- andlong-term mortality was significantly lower for patients that under-went to neurosurgery than in patients receiving medical treatment (see Figs. 28and 29). Conclusions: We observed mortality to be lower than predicted by ICH score and functional outcome to be acceptable in one-third of patients. Full treatment including neurosurgery significantly im- proved short and long term survival for patients with ICH score 3. Prognosis estimation after an ICH remains a challenging subject andearly DNROs and limitations of treatment should be carefullyevaluated. References 1. Hemphill, J. C. et al .

Barbadillo - Hospital General de Catalunya, Intensive Care Department, Sant Cugat del Valles, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A479 Introduction: Influenza infection causes severe morbidity and mortality around the world. Pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 have been de- scribe to increases disease severity comparing with seasonal flu viruses. There are limited data comparing clinical differences between influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A(H3N2) infection in critically ill patients. Objectives: Our aim was to analyse the demographic and clinical dif- ferences between patients admitted to ICU due to pandemic influ- enza A(H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza A(H3N2) infection. Methods: Prospective, observational, multicenter study conducted in 148 Spanish ICUs from 2009 to 2015. Individuals with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 were compared with those infected by influenza A (H3N2). All serotypes were confirmed using RT-PCR at ICU admission. Pa- tients\u00b4 demographic, clinical, radiologic features, laboratory values, ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS) and outcomes were recorded. Discrete variables are expressed as percentage and continuous variables as me- dians with 25th to 75th interquartile range (IQR). Differences between groups were assessed using the x2t e s ta n dt h eF i s h e re x a c tt e s tf o rc a t - egoric variables and Mann -Whitney Utest for continuous variables. Results: Of 2898 patients with confirmed influenza infection at ICU admission, 110 were excluded due to influenza B (n = 56) or non- serotype A typification (n = 54). At all, 2421 patients with influenza A (H1N1) were compared to 367 patients with influenza A (H3N2). Pa- tients with A(H1N1) were much younger vs 61 [50 -73], P < 0.001), presented a higher multiorgan dysfunction (61,2 % vs 55,4 %, P = 0.038), and required more invasive mechanical ventilation (70,6 % vs 65.1 %, P = 0.046), and prone position(18.9 % vs 13.0 %, P = 0.007). Patients with A(H3N2) had more comorbidities: COPD (30.4 % vs 19.5 %, P < 0.001), heart failure(18,6 % vs 10.0 %, P < 0.001), chronic renal failure(14,5 % vs 7,6 %, P < 0.001), and dia- betes(23,9 % vs 15,3 %, P < 0.001). Patients with A(H3N2) presented more bacterial coinfection pneumonia (26,5 % vs 14,4 %, P < 0.001) and a higher vaccination rate (23,5 % vs 5,7 %, P < 0.001). Influenza A(H1N1) group have an increased ICU length of stay (LOS) (11[5 -21] vs 8[4 -19], P < 0.001) but there is no difference in hospital LOS. No statistically significant difference in overall mortality was observed (21.9 % H1N1 vs 24.2 % H3N2, P = 0337). Conclusions: Our data suggest than Infuenza A subtypes have different clinical presentation in critically ill patients. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 affect younger patients with less comorbidities suf- fering an acute and more severe respiratory disease. Influenza A (H3N2) is presented more frecuently with bacterial coinfection in older patients with more chronic illness and especially CPOD. The overall mortality was high without differences between groups. References: Schaffer A.et al. BMC Public Health. 2012; 12:869. Mitchell et al. Am J Infect Control. 2013; 41:1032 -7.

Bos - Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A480 Introduction: During the past ten years the paradigm of a \"healthy lung is a sterile lung \"was challenged [1 -5]. The healthy lung ap- peared to be populated by multiple resident bacterial species, that migrate to the distal airways from the oral cavity [2]. According tothe adapted island model the respiratory microbiome represents adynamic community, where the equilibrium point is achieved by the balance between immigration and elimination mechanisms [6]. Objectives: We hypothesized that mechanical ventilation and anti- biotic administration decrease the diversity of the respiratory micro-biome and that these changes are more profound in patients who develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Methods: Intubated and mechanically ventilated ICU-patients were included. Tracheal aspirates were obtained three times a week. 16SRNA sequencing with the Roche 454 platform was used to measure the composition of the respiratory microbiome. Associations were tested with linear mixed model analysis. The relative changes werecompared between patients that did and did not develop VAP.Results: 35 patients were included; 11 had VAP, 18 did not have VAP. Six additional patients developed pneumonia within the first 48 hours after intubation. Duration of mechanical ventilation was associatedwith a decrease in Shannon diversity (fixed-effect regression coeffi-cient (\u00df): 0.03 [95%CI: 0.05 - -0.005]), but the administration of antibiotic therapy was not (fixed-effect \u00df: 0.06; 95%CI: 0.17 - 0.30). There was a statistically significant increase in abundance of Pseudo-monadales and a decrease in abundance of Lactobacillales, Gemel-lales, Actinomycetales and Clostridiales between the moment of intubation and extubation. There were no statistically significant dif- ferences between patients that did and did not develop VAP.Conclusions: Mechanical ventilation, but not antibiotic administra- tion, was associated with changes in the respiratory microbiome. Duration of mechanical ventilation was associated with increased abundances of Pseudomonadales. The dynamics in the respiratorymicrobiome were not different between patients that did and didnot develop VAP. References 1. Dickson RP. Ann Am Thorac Soc 2015. 2. Bassis CM. mBio 2015. 3. Morris A.

To our knowledge, no study to date has specifically evalu- ated ventilator-associated (VA) lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI)in this population.Objectives: To determine the incidence, etiology and outcome of VA-LRTI in IC patients, and to compare it with patients with no appar- ent immunosuppression.Methods: Post-hoc analysis of the large prospective multinational TAVeM database, coming from 114 ICUs [1]. All consecutive patients receiving mechanical ventilation for >48 h were included. The inci- dence, etiology and (neoplasia, haematological malignancy, AIDS, allogeneic stem cell transplant, immunosuppressant drug, organ transplant) and non-IC patients.Results: Among the 2960 included patients, 663 (22 %) were IC. The incidence of VA-LRTI was significantly lower in IC compared with non-IC patients (116 (17.5 %) versus 573 (25 %), p < 0.0001, OR = 0.64 [95%CI 0.51-0.79]). Although VAT incidence was significantly lower inIC compared with non-IC patients (7.8 % vs 11.7 %, p = 0.04), no sig-nificant difference was found in VAP incidence between the two groups (9.7 % vs 13.3 %, p = 0.13, respectively). In patients with VA-LRTI, rate of prior antibiotic treatment was signifi-cantly higher in IC compared with non-IC patients (80 % vs 66 %, p= 0.001). The incidence of progression from VAT to VAP was similar in IC and non-IC patients non-IC patients received appropriate antibiotics for VA-LRTI inthe same proportions (77 % vs 79 %, p = 0.5). Same results were ob-tained in VAT and VAP subgroups. Among IC patients with VAT, 39/ 52 (75 %) received appropriate antibiotics. Percentage of IC patients with progression from VAT to VAP was significantly lower in patientswho received appropriate compared with those who received in-appropriate antibiotic treatment (8 % vs 31 %, p = 0.035, OR 0.19 (95 % CI 0.03-0.99)). The incidence of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria was higher in ICcompared to non-IC patients with VA-LRTI (72 % vs 59 %, p = 0.01),similar results were found in the subgroup of patients with VAP (78 % vs 58 %, p = 0.001), but not in those with VAT (65 % vs 61 %, p = 0.52). Among patients with VA-LRTI, MRSA (5.2 % vs 1.7 %, p = 0.025) andEnterobacter spp. (21 % vs 10 %, p = 0.001) were significantly morefrequent in IC compared with non-IC patients. ICU mortality rate was higher in IC compared with non-IC patients with VA-LRTI (54 %, vs 30 %, p < 0.0001, OR 2.68 (95 % CI 1.78-4.02)).Similar results were obtained in VAT and VAP subgroups.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 249 of 607Conclusions: Incidence of VA-LRTI is significantly lower in IC com- pared with non-IC patients. MDR bacteria and mortality rates are significantly higher in IC compared with non-IC patients with VA- LRTI. References 1.

In the Netherlands the guidelines recommends a duration of antibiotic therapy in severe CAP for at least five till seven days. Objectives: The purpose of this trial was to evaluate whether procal- citonin measurements were able to reduce antibiotic usage in pa- tients with severe CAP in Dutch intensive care units by reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment without increasing mortality or recur- rent infections. Methods: From 2009 until 2013 a randomized intervention trial was performed in three university medical centres and 12 teaching hospi- tals in the Netherlands [2]. In this Dutch multicentre trial all patients admitted to the intensive care unit and who received antibiotics for presumed infection were assigned to a PCT-guided or standard-of- care antibiotic discontinuation. In this study a sub analysis for all pa- tients with a severe community-acquired pneumonia was performed. Stopping advice for antibiotics was provided when PCT was 20 % of its peak value or 0.5 ug/L. Mortality and duration of antibiotic treatment (DOT) were the primary endpoints of this study. Results: In 15 ICUs 440 patients with severe community acquired pneumonia were randomized for PCT-guidance (n = 208) or standard-of-care (n = 232). The median DOT was 5.5 (3 -8) and 7 days (4-10) respectively (P < 0 \u00b7 001). No difference in reinstitution of anti- biotics or CRP-levels within 28 days after randomization was ob- served. Mortality at 28 days was 43/208 (20.7 %) and 58/232 (25 \u00b7 0 %) in the PCT and standard-of-care group respectively (P = 0.31). One-year mortality was 63/208 (30.3 %) and 90/232 (38.8 %) in the PCT and standard-of-care group respectively.Conclusions: In this prospective randomized trial, the addition of PCT-measurements to assist intensivists in duration of antibiotic ther- apy in severe community-acquired pneumonia, resulted in a clear re- duction of antibiotic treatment from 7 days (IQR 4 -10 days) in the control group to 5.5 days (IQR 3 -8 days) in the PCT-guided patient group, without increase of mortality or subsequent antibiotic prescriptions.

Giving that such patients show an in- creasing risk of important gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, stress-ulcer prophylaxis (SUP) has been recommended for the prevention of upper GI hemorrhage. SUP strategy rely on drugs that block the se- cretion of gastric acid and increase the gastric pH (histamine-2-recep- tor antagonists - H2RA, and proton pump inhibitor - PPI) and those that does not alter gastric pH (sucralfate). The increase of gastric pH leads to bacterial overgrowth and potential colonization of trachea determining a higher risk of VAP.Table 14 (abstract A481).

Our objective was to evaluate the risk of VAP accounting for expos-ure to H2RA, PPI and sucralfate.Methods: We recruited 772 patients in a multicenter prospective ob- servational study, conducted in 21 Italian ICUs. Patients admitted to the ICU for at least 48 hours, received MV from the admission, andwere followed until discharge, the day of withholding MV, the day oftransfer in other hospital ward, or death.We recorded demographic data, admission category, and severity scores on admission. Each day of ICU staying SUP approach (H2RA, PPI or sucralfate) was recorded.VAP was defined as pneumonia occurring after a MV period of atleast 48 hours during the ICU stay.Independent relationships be- tween VAP incidence and the specific SUP approach was assessed by using a logistic regression analysis.Results: Among 772 patients experiencing on average 11.3 days of MV, 116 (15 %) developed VAP. Sucralfate was less frequently used (8 %), while 28 % has been receiving H2RA and 77 % PPI. The risk of VAP was higher for patients treated mainly with PPI (OR 4.27, 95%CI2.57-7.09) than those who received H2RA (OR 2.30, 95%CI 1.08-5.07).Conclusions: Our study show that the use of ranitidine is associated with a lower risk of VAP, compared with PPI. Sucralfate was less fre- quently used in the participating ICUs. Although some meta-analysisindicate a lower risk of VAP associated with sucralfate, an importantstudy have not established a superiority of this medication compared with ranitidine [1]. Miano et al. compared the use of pantoprazole vs ranitidine in Cardiothoracic Surgery patients showing that pantopra-zole was associated with a higher rate of VAP [2]. Such VAP rate asso-ciated with PPI would seem to be linked to a greater antacid power than ranitidine. This can lead to a more extensive gastric bacterial colonization in patients treated with these drugs. Randomized-Controlled Trial of Stress-ulcer prophylaxis are needed to assesswhich drug show the highest risk of VAP and the relationship with the incidence of major GI bleeding.

Lopez-Delgado - Hospital Universitari de Bellvitge, Intensive Care, L' Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain Intensive Care Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A484 Introduction: Low preoperative albumin reflects a poor nutritional status that influences outcome in cardiac surgery (CS). However, postoperative albumin levels are influenced by nutritional status andinflammatory response. Thus, its value and utility as a prognosticmarker is unclear. Objectives: To evaluate the influence of postoperative plasma levels of albumin in the outcome of patients who underwent cardiac sur-gery (CS).Methods: Prospective, observational study in Surgical ICU in a referral hospital. Albumin was measured during the first 24 h after CS, to- gether with clinical data and outcomes including in-hospital andlong-term mortality (follow-up of 4.6 \u00b1 2.4 years). Patients wereclassified into different categories based on plasma albumin levels: normal( 35 g \u0081L 1), low deficit(30 -34.9 g \u0081L1), moderate deficit(25 - severe deficit (<25 g \u0081L1). Results: 2818 patients were included. Mean age was 64.5 \u00b1 11.6 years; 63.8 % (n = 1799) 28 \u00b1 4.3Kg \u00b7 m-2. 5.8 %(n = 162) had normal levels, 32.8 %(n = 924) low deficit, 44.3 %(n = 1249) moderate deficit and 17.1 %(n = 483) severe deficit.We showed that not having low albumin levels 24 h after CS wasprotector for in-hospital (HR:0.844;95 % IC:0.805-0.844; P = 0.007 ) (HR:0.846; 95 % IC:0.821-0.871; P < 0.001 ). Subgroups of patients with low albumin levels showed worst survivalduring hospital stay (98.1 % for normal subgroup, 97.3 % low deficit,95 % moderate deficit and 85.9 % severe deficit; P < 0.001 ) and from the long-term mortality scenario (5-year mortality was 94.3 % for nor- mal subgroup, 87.4 % low deficit, 83.1 % moderate deficit and72.4 % severe deficit; P < 0.001 ). Multivariable analysis showed higher in-hospital mortality, sepsis and hemorrhage related complications and higher ICU stay in subgroups of patients with low albumin levels Predictors for the presence of any levels of hypoalbuminemia weresuffering from any degree of chronic kidney disease (OR:1.316;95 %IC:1.085-1.595; P = 0.005 ), preoperative previous CS (OR:1.229;1.067- 1.415; P = 0.004 ) and longer Cardiopulmonary (OR:1.904;95 % IC:1.902-2.128; P < 0.001 ). Conclusions: Physicians may be aware about the degree of hypoal- buminemia in the postoperative of CS due to its influence in out- comes, even in long-term survival. Relationship between factorsassociated with nutritional and inflammatory status may be associ-ated with the development of postoperative hypoalbuminemia. References 1. Karas PL, Goh SL, Dhital K.

Griffiths 1, Research Guildford, UK;4University of Surrey, Guildford, UK Correspondence: B. Creagh-Brown - University of Surrey, Guildford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A485 Introduction: Post-operative pulmonary complications (POPC) are common with a reported incidence ranging from 2 %-40 %. Adverseoutcomes include death, longer hospital stays and lower long termsurvival, which is independent of pre-operative risk. The most widely recognised prediction tool for POPCs is ARISCAT. Interventions to re- duce POPCs have been studied individually but the use of a carebundle (CB) has not been widely investigated. Enhanced recovery(ER) pathways are 'standard of care' for major surgery - however some patients may benefit from additional focused interventions. An example of a CB for POPCs is the \u00b4I COUGH\u00b4 study, which demon-strated a trend towards reduction in POPCs. Results may be superiorif the intervention is targeted to a high-risk group. Objectives: 1) To perform a survey of members of the ESICM POIC section: tochoose international experts for the Delphi and to share their opin-ions on a POPC-CB.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 251 of 6072) To recruit a team of experts to participate in and complete an email-based Delphi consensus, leading to the formulation of a CB. Methods: A SurveyMonkey of members of the ESICM POIC section was conducted. International experts were identified from this sur-vey. A Delphi consensus was conducted anonymously via email over 3 rounds, to 36 independently chosen experts. Each round com- prised of a series of statements which experts were asked to respondto using a five-point Likert scale. There were free text spaces forcomments and the possibility for papers to be circulated. After each round, anonymous feedback was circulated to the Delphi group and the previous results were used to create the statements for the sub-sequent round. At the end of the process, final feedback was sent tothe group with the consensus and suggested care bundle. Results: Survey: 362 respondents. \u00b7Routine screening for high-risk of POPC occurs in 50 % of centres.\u00b7Information about current practice in relation to various pre-, intra-and post-operative interventions was ascertained. \u00b7Almost 80 % of respondents would be happy to assess the feasibility of implementing a POPC-CB.Delphi: The preferred number of components in the POPC care bun-dle was 7. Care bundle elements supported by the consensus process were: \u00b7PRE-operatively: a supervised exercise programme and inspiratorymuscle training.\u00b7INTRA-operatively: low tidal volume ventilation with individualised PEEP, use of routine monitoring to avoid hyperoxia and efforts made to limit neuromuscular blockade.\u00b7POST-operatively: deep breathing exercises and mandatory elevationof the head of the bed. Conclusions: A POPC care bundle has been suggested for use, in addition to enhanced recovery pathways, in major surgical patientsat high-risk of POPC. Prospective evaluation of feasibility, before anevaluation of effectiveness, is now indicated.

Doyle - Department of Intensive Care Medicine and Surrey Peri-Operative Anaesthesia and Critical Care Collaborative Research Group (SPACER), Guildford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A486 Introduction: 80 % of UK in-hospital surgical mortality occurs in those undergoing high-risk surgical intervention such as emergency laparotomy (EL) (1) these patients are among the largest consumersof hospital resources (2, 3). Furthermore it was suggested that UKoutcomes are worse than comparable countries (4). In the 2011 review of peri-operative care of high-risk patients NCE- POD reported care was good in less than half of patients leading toconsiderable health and financial costs (5).As such there was a clear need for a change in the approach to pa- tients having an EL. Since this study the first national emergency laparotomy audit (NELA) has been published demonstrating a 30-daymortality of 11 % (6).Objectives: T h ea i m sw e r et oc r e a t eaf o c u s e d ,e v i d e n c e - b a s e dE m e r - gency Laparotomy Pathway (ELP) deliv ered by a multidisciplinary (MDT) team, utilising care bundles to improve delivery of care and assess theimpact of the pathway on hospital mo rtality and length of stay (LOS).Methods Pathway design: A Emergency Laparotomy Group (ELG) was con- vened and designed the ELP based on principles of best basic prac-tice and the recommendations of the RCS (2) and NCEPOD (5). TheELP covered the entire surgical stay of the patient in 4 stages. Study protocol: Data was collected for consecutive patients, 50 pre and 96 post-ELP during 2011/2012. The primary outcome measurewas in hospital mortality. Secondary outcomes were ICU mortality,ICU and hospital LOS. Results: The in-hospital mortality fell from 21.7 % Pre-ELP to 9.6 % Post-ELP (p = 0.048). There is a strong trend towards significance in asurvival analysis (p = 0.053). There was no significant difference inhospital LOS between Pre and Post cohorts. (Median 15.5 days vs 15 days, p = 0.875). There was no difference in the ICU LOS (3 vs 2 days, p = 0.3339), nor in the utilisation of high level beds.Conclusion: The introduction of an ELP reduced the in hospital mor- tality significantly, this has since been further evidenced with a 4- centre (including our own) study demonstrating a case-mix adjusted decrease risk of death from 15.6 % to 9.6 %, p = 0.002 (7). ELP is auseful tool reducing the risk of failure to deliver optimal care. References 1. Pearse RM. Identification and characterisation of the high-risk surgical population in the UK.

Methods: A multicenter randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the dexmedetomidine-based strategy in septic patients in eight ICUs. We included adult septic patients who were expected to require mechanical ventilation for at least 24 hours. Patients were randomized to receive sedation strategy either with dexmedetomi- dine (DEX group) or without dexmedetomidine (non-DEX group). Additionally, fentanyl, propofol, and midazolam were used as re- quired to achieve the sedation goal in both groups which was set to Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale 0 (calm) for daytime and 2 (light sedation) for nighttime. Results: We included 201 patients (mean age 68.8 years), of whom 127 (63 %) were men. Mean Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score was 23. The baseline characteristics were similar between groups. In the DEX group, well-controlled sedation rate was higher (p = 0.002) and delirium rate was lower (p = 0.03) during ventilation compared with those in the non-DEX group. At 28 days, 19 of 100 patients (19 %) in the DEX group and 28 of 101 patients (28 %) in the non-DEX group had died (p = 0.14). The ventilator-free days in a 28-day period did not differ between the groups, at 22 days (interquar- tile range [IQR], 17 -25) and 21 days (IQR, 15.5-24.5) (p = 0.49). In a predefined subgroup analysis that included 104 patients with APACHE II score of 23 or more, 28-day mortality in the DEX group was significantly lower than that in the non-DEX group (odds ratio 0.40, 95 % confidential interval 0.17-0.93). Conclusions: A sedation strategy using dexmedetomidine compared with a strategy without dexmedetomidine induced well-controlled sedation in ventilated septic patients but did not significantly im- prove 28-day mortality and the number of ventilator-free days. Al- though more critically ill patients may benefit from a dexmedetomidine strategy, further studies are needed to confirm this result. References Pandharipande PP et al. Crit Care 2010; 14: R38.

Ryg\u00e5rd - University of Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, Department of Intensive Care, K\u00f8benhavn, Denmark Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A488 Introduction: Using a restrictive transfusion strategy appears to be safe in critically ill patients [1,2] but there may be subgroups of patients benefiting from transfusion at a higher haemoglobin level [3]. Objectives: We explored if subgroups of patients with septic shock had worse outcome when transfused at a lower versus a higher haemoglobin threshold.Methods: By performing post-hoc analyses of the whole trial popula- tion of 998 patients from the Transfusion Requirements in Septic Shock (TRISS) trial [2], we investigated the intervention effect in pa- tients with severe co-morbidity (chronic lung disease, haematological malignancy or metastatic cancer), patients who had undergone sur- gery (either elective or acute) and patients with septic shock as de- fined by the new definition of septic shock: lactate above 2 mmol/l and treatment with vasopressors [4]. Results: The baseline characteristics were mostly similar between the 2 intervention groups in the different subgroups. There were no dif- ferences in the intervention effect on 90-day mortality in patients with chronic lung disease (test of interaction P=0.31), haemato- logical malignancy ( P=0.47), metastatic cancer shock by the new definition ( P= 0.20) or in those who had under- gone surgery ( P= 0.99), see Table. Conclusions: In exploratory analyses of a randomised trial in patients with septic shock, we observed no mortality benefit in any subgroups of transfusion at a haemoglobin threshold of 90 g/dl vs. 70 g/dl.

In 2006, the Sabadell group developed a sim- ple but subjective prognostic score which made this prognosis expli- cit [1,2]. However, the Sabadell score has not been validated beyond hospital survival or for long-term health related quality of life (HRQoL). Objectives: To compare ICU physicians' subjective long-term progno- sis with the observed long-term survival and HRQoL. Methods: The first admissions of all patients discharged alive from the ICU of the University Medical Center Utrecht between March 2012 and December 2014 were included in the study. The Sabadell score was determined and recorded by the treating physician at the time of ICU discharge ('0 - Good prognosis', '1 - Poor long-term prognosis (>6 months) with unlimited ICU readmission', '2 - (<6 months); expected during hospitalisation, ICU readmission not recommended'). Survival status was verified using the municipal registry one year after ICU discharge. In one-year ICU survivors HRQoL was measured using the EuroQoL 5D-3LTMindex score, di- chotomized at 0.4 into high or low HRQoL. The analyses included agreement between Sabadell score and one-year outcome cat- egories, and a description of correctly and incorrectly estimated prognosis groups. Results: Of the 4,874 eligible patients, 3,796 (77.9 %) had completed follow-up and were included into the study (see Fig. 32). In-hospital mortality was 3.1 %, 9.3 %, 39.1 % and 81.6 % for the Sabadell scores 0-3 respectively. In 2,849/3796 (75.1 %) the Sabadell score accur- ately predicted one-year outcome (Fig. 33). Table 15shows patient characteristics for the study population, and the groups where prog- nosis was over- and underestimated respectively. Compared to pa- tients with a correct estimate of prognosis, both patient groups with over- or underestimated prognoses were more often admitted for non-surgical reasons, and more severely ill at admission and during ICU stay. Conclusions: In three out of four patients, the Sabadell score was in accordance with one-year prognosis. Only in less than 10 % of pa- tients surviving ICU there was major disagreement between a physi- cian's prediction and the observed long-term outcome. References 1. Fernandez R et al.

McWilliams1, C. Snelson2 1University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust, Critical Care, Birmingham, UK;2University Hospital Birmingham, Critical Care, Birmingham, UK Correspondence: C. Snelson - University Hospital Birmingham, Critical Care, Birmingham, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A490 Introduction: Early and enhanced rehabilitation of patients in critical care is associated with improved patient outcomes (1). We have pre-viously published the results of a quality improvement project pro- moting early and enhanced rehabilitation for patients mechanically ventilated for greater than 5 days, and shown an improvement inmobility levels at ICU discharge that was associated with a significantreduction in ICU and hospital length of stay, ventilator days and in- hospital mortality (2). The impact of such mobility programs on lon- ger term outcomes is unknown.Objectives: To assess the 3 year mortality of patients mechanically ventilated for more than 5 days and who survived to ICU discharge pre and post a quality improvement project enhancing rehabilitation on critical care.Methods: The study took place within a large, tertiary referral ICU. A supportive rehabilitation team was created within the ICU in April 2012 with a focus on promoting early and enhanced rehabilitation for patients at high risk for prolonged ICU and hospital length ofstays. The intervention has been described in detail in a previouspublication, and was successful in improving mobility levels at ICU discharge. For all patients who survived to ICU discharge, mortality at 3 years was assessed.Results: The mean age of the total court was 53 years. A total of 201 patients in the pre-quality improvement (Pre QI) group and 222 patients in the post quality improvement (Post QI) were dis- charged from ICU alive. The 3 year mortality rate was 81/201(40.3 %) in the Pre QI group vs 60/222 (27 %) in the Post QIgroup; p = 0.004. Conclusions: The introduction of early and enhanced rehabilitation within the ICU was associated with a significant reduction in 3 yearmortality of ICU survivors. This hypothesis generating data warrantsfurther evaluation in future randomized controlled trials of the intervention. References 1. Hashem, M et al.

Comparisons were made between survivors (S) and non- survivors (NS). Data are analyzed according to their nature; a p < .05was considered significant. Independent predictors of post-ICU mortal-ity were identified by logistic regression. Results: 320 patients from 26 hospitals across Argentina were in- cluded. The data are shown on Tables 16,17and 18. Global post-ICU mortality was 22 %; respectively 15 %, 5 % and 2 %at 2,6, and 12 months post hospital discharge. Independent predic- tors of mortality were: age (OR SOFA 24hs (OR 1.12[1.02-.1.23];p 0.013). Calibration adequate 0.407; AUROC 0.79, respectively).Conclusions: 1. Most patients were middle-aged men, admitted to public hospitals for medical causes, 60 % with 1 comorbidities and very acutely ill, according to APACHE II and SOFA scores.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 255 of 6072. Complications as ARDS, shock and infections were frequent, occur- ring in more than a half of patients. 3. 1-year mortality was 22 %. Most patients died within twomonths after hospital discharge. Yet no single ICU event was as-sociated with post-ICU mortality; only age and organ failures were independent predictors of this outcomes.

In this retrospective study, all of the patients with laboratory-confirmed severe dengue infections and admitted to ICUwere enrolled between July 31 and November 31 in 2015 during thelarge outbreak period. The medical records of all the recruited pa- tients were retrospectively reviewed and the following information was collected: age, gender, clinical manifestations, disease severityscores, underlying conditions, laboratory examinations, and outcome.The primary endpoint is to find the predictors of in-hospital mortality. Results: During study period, there were a total of 4787 patients with dengue infections, and 143 (2.99 %) patients with severe dengue in-fection required ICU admission. Among 143 critically ill patients, their mean age was 69.7 years. Hypertension (n = 90, 62.9 %) and diabetes mellitus (n = 70, 49.0 %) were the two most common underlying dis-eases. Eighty patients (55.9 %) had co-bacterial infections, and 33 pa-tients had co-bacteremia. Hematologic system was the most common failure organ, followed by chest and cardiovascular systems. Fever was the most common presentation (n = 112, 78.3 %), followed by anorexia(n = 47, 32.9 %), and abdominal pain (n = 46, 32.2 %). Overall, a total of33 patients had mortality, and the rate of mortality was 23.1 %. In multivariate analysis, we found that in-hospital mortality was signifi- cantly associated with lower Glasgow coma scale, lower platelet countbefore ICU discharge, and higher number of organ failures.Conclusions: The outcome of severe dengue patients requiring ICU admission remains high and the mortality was associated with lower Glasgow coma scale, lower platelet counts and more organ failures.Additionally, more than half of patients would have bacterial infec-tions during severe dengue infections.

In survivors of critical care, it is not know if eosinopenia is predictive of adverse outcomes following hospitaldischarge.Objectives: We hypothesized that eosinopenia at ICU admission would be associated with increased hospital readmission rates and higher mortality following hospital discharge.Methods: We performed a two center observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical intensive care units. We studied 68,648 patients, age 18 years, who received critical care between 1998 and 2012 and survived hospitalization. The exposure of interestwas absolute eosinophil count within 48 hours of ICU admissionand categorized a priori as 10/ul, 10-50/ul, 50-350/ul (normal range) and >350/ul. The primary outcome was all cause mortality in the 90 days following hospital discharge determined using theUS Social Security Administration Death Master File. 365-dayfollow-up was present in all cohort patients. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression models with inclusion of covariate terms for age, race, gender, Deyo-CharlsonIndex, patient type (medical versus surgical), sepsis and numberof organs with acute failure. Results: The cohort patients were 57.8 % male, 20.3 % nonwhite and 48.8 % surgical. 10.1 % of the cohort had sepsis, and the mean agewas 61.7 years. Median [IQR] absolute eosinophil count was 90 [30 - 190]. 90-day post discharge mortality was 7.7 %. 30-day readmission rate was 14.3 %. A decreased absolute eosinophil count was a ro- bustly associated with all-cause post discharge mortality as well ashospital readmission and discharge to a care facility instead of home.Patients with an absolute eosinophil count of 10/ul or 10-50/ul have an adjusted OR of 90-day post-discharge mortality of 1.58 (95%CI, 1.46-1.71; P < 1.49 (95%CI, 1.38-1.60; P < 0.001) relative topatients with an absolute eosinophil count of 50-350/ul. Patients withan absolute eosinophil count of 10/ul or 10-50/ul have an adjusted OR of 30-day readmission of 1.08 (95%CI, 1.01-1.15; P = 0.018) or 1.10 (95%CI, 1.04-1.17; P = 0.001) relative to patients with an absolute eo-sinophil count of 50-350/ul. Finally, patients with an absolute eosino-phil count of 10/ul or 10-50/ul have an adjusted OR of discharge to a care facility of 1.34 (95%CI, 1.28-1.41; P < 0.001) or 1.30 (95%CI, 1.24-1.36; P < 0.001) relative to patients with an absolute eosinophilcount of 50-350/ul. An absolute eosinophil count >350/ul was not as-sociated with study outcomes. Conclusions: In critical illness survivors, eosinopenia at ICU admission is a robust predictor of mortality following discharge, hospital re-admission, and discharge to a care facility. Eosinopenia is a markerfor ICU survivors at an especially high risk for adverse outcomes. Thus, patients with eosinopenia may benefit from closer post dis- charge follow-up and higher intensity rehabilitation.

Weijs - Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A494 Introduction: Critical illness is marked by hypermetabolism and in- creased protein catabolism. While studies suggest that protein deliv- ery may be beneficial for critical illness outcomes, to date, limited information exists regarding the association between protein deliveryduring hospitalization and outcomes in ICU survivors following hos-pital discharge.Objectives: We hypothesized that higher protein intake might have a protective effect in patients with malnutrition. Methods: We performed a single center observational study of pa- tients treated in medical intensive care units in Boston, Massachu-setts. We studied 801 patients age 18 years, who received critical care following between 2004 and 2011 and survived to hospital dis- charge. All patients underwent a Registered Dietitian formal assess-ment within 48 hours of ICU admission. The exposure of interest, gramsof protein per kilogram body weight delivered per day, was determined from all oral, enteral and parenteral sources for up to 28 days. Nutrition status was categorized as non-specific malnutrition, protein-energymalnutrition, or at risk for malnutrition via anthropometric measure-ments, clinical signs of malnutrition, malnutrition risk factors, and meta- bolic stress. The primary outcome was all cause 90-day post-discharge mortality. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated by mixed- effects logis-tic regression models to describe how 90-day post-discharge mortalitydiffered with changes in protein delivery. Results: The cohort was 55 % male, 79 % white with a mean age of 62.3 years. 22 % of the cohort had sepsis, 10 % had acute kidney in-jury and 35 % had non-cardiac acute respiratory failure. 59 % hadnon-specific malnutrition or protein-energy malnutrition. The 30, 90 and 365-day post-discharge mortality was 7.1 and 13.9 and 24.4 %. The average number of nutrition delivery days recorded was 15. In amixed-effect logistic regression model adjusted for age, gender, race,Deyo-Charlson Index, acute organ failures, sepsis and percent energy needs met, 90-day post-discharge mortality rate was 17 % (95%CI: 6 - 26) lower for each 1 g/kg increase in daily protein delivery ( P= 0.002) compared with the 90-day [OR 0.74-0.94; P = 0.002)]. In of patients with malnutrition (n = 473): 90-day post-discharge mortality rate was 30 % (95%CI: 6 -26) lower for each 1 g/kg increase in daily protein delivery (P < 0.001) compared with the 90-day post-discharge mortal-ity rate in the entire cohort [OR = (95%CI 0.61-0.81; P < 0.001)]. Conclusions: In adult MICU patients who survive to hospital dis- charge, protein intake appears to be predictive of out of hospital out-comes. Patients with improvements in protein intake duringhospitalization independent of energy intake have decreased mortal- ity in the 3 months following hospital discharge. The achievement of ideal protein delivery may be an important factor in ICU survivorship,especially in malnutrition.

The aim was to assess the efficacy of this new ILE in sur- gery compared with MCT/LCT,and it was tested for safety, tolerance, metabolic and clinical efficacy in surgical patients.Objectives: To assess the efficacy of this new ILE in gastrointestinal surgery compared with MCT/LCT. Methods: In this prospective study, 42 patients were randomized to SMOFlipid 20 % or MCT/LCT (Lipovenoes 20 %) group. Clinical andbiochemistry data were collected. Inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6)and liver function indicators (ALT,AST,TBIL)were measured. Results: 32 patients (17 males and 15 females) with a mean age of 51 years completed the study. The patients' baseline datas(age,gender, APACHE II) were similar in two groups( p> 0.05). The pa- tients' baseline datas(age, gender, APACHE II)were similar in two groups.The increment of triglyceride on day 5 from baseline was significantly lower in SMOFlipid group than in Lipovenoes MCT/LCT group( P< 0.05). The of alanine aspartate transaminase (AST) and totalbilirubin on Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 257 of 607were significantly lower in SMOFlipid group than in control group( P< 0.05). Inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6)were not differ- triglyceride-lowering effectas compared with MCT/LCT and may be associated with a better liver tolerance in surgical critically ill. References 1.

Several mechanisms and risk factors have been described to explainthis syndrome. Glucocorticoids, which are frequently used in ICU, in-duce muscle atrophy, but the mechanism still remains to be eluci- dated. Connexin based hemichannels (Cx HCs), are channels formed by six connexin proteins and communicates the intra with extra cel-lular space since they are permeable to ions and small molecules(e.g., ATP). Recently, CxHCs have been associated to denervation- induced skeletal muscle atrophy (1), and may also participate in the pathogenesis of corticoids induced muscle atrophy.Objectives: To evaluate the possible of Cx HCs in dexamethasone-induced muscular out (KO) mice (Cx43fl/flCx45fl/fl and Cx43fl/flCx45fl/fl:Myo-Cre) micewere used. KO mice were skeletal muscle deficient for connexin43 and 45. Also, Lanthanum, a connexin blocker, was used in ex- periments. Presence and functionality of Cx HCs was evaluated acutely after 5 hours of dexamethasone exposure, by cellular Eth-idium uptake, Evans blue permeability, intracellular free Ca2+,resting membrane potential, immunohistochemistry, and western blot. NFkb Phosphorylation and mRNA levels of TNF-alpha were also assessed. Finally, muscle atrophy was evaluated by cross sec-tional area (CSA) after 7 days of dexamethasone exposure. Also,atrogin-1 MurF-1, are two E3 ligases ubiquitin- proteasome system (intracellular degradation system), levels were evaluated.Results: Freshly isolated myofibers from mice treated with dexa- methasone by 5 h showed de novo expression of functional connex- ins 39, 43, 45 and pannexins (P2X7R) which were mainly distributed on sarcolemma. Cx HCs expression was present only in WT myofi-bers, was blocked by La, and was absent in KO mice. Accordingly, asignificant increase in basal intracellular free Ca2+ levels, and a de- crease of resting membrane potential of about 10 mV, was observed in myofibers from WT mice treated with dexamethasone comparedwith mice injected with saline buffer or in KO mice. Moreover, dexa-methasone induced the phosphorylation of NFkb and increased the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha. Finally, seven days treatment with dexa- methasone drastically reduced the CSA of myofibers from WT micebut not KO animals. Both, atrogin-1 and MurF-1 were elevated in WTanimals in comparison with KO mice.Conclusions: Dexamethasone induces the expression of Ca2+ perme- able channels such as connexins, which leads to muscle atrophy. Connexins are upstream to the activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system. Connexins are a novel family of proteins whichshould be studied for prevention of corticoids-induced muscle atrophy.

Indirect calorimetry isthe most accurate method, but available calorimeters do not support EE measurement at inspired oxygen (FiO 2) >80 %, preventing meas- urement in the most severely ill. The Beacon Caresystem (MermaidCare, N\u00f8rresundby, Denmark) for advising on mechanical ventilationincludes indirect calorimetry designed for use in the full FiO 2range, but has not been compared to other calorimeters. Objectives: To compare the Beacon Caresystem to the E-COVX (Datex-Ohmeda, GE Health Care, Helsinki, Finland) at varying FiO 2. Methods: Twenty healthy male subjects were included. Informed consent and ethical approval were obtained in all cases. Measure- ments from 16 subjects (age 32 \u00b1 12 yrs) were analysed, the remain-der excluded due to gas leakage. Subjects were mechanicallyventilated by mask (Servo-I, Maquet, Solna, Sweden) in pressure sup- port (PS: 3 2O, PEEP: 3 cm H 2O) at FiO 2of 21, 50 and 85 %, in that order, for 15 min at each FiO 2. Analysis periods were selected where COV for average oxygen consumption (VO 2) and CO 2produc- tion (VCO 2) were < 5 % in five consecutive 1 min intervals (2). VO 2, VCO 2and EE were compared between devices (Beacon - E-COVX) at each FiO 2by Bland-Altman analysis of bias and limits of agreement (LOA) and within devices between 21 and 85 % FiO 2by paired t-tests. Results: VO2, VCO 2and EE [73 - 19] ml/min, 18] ml/min, and % FiO 50] 6 [ - 320] kcal/day at 50 FiO 2; [ 87 - 139] ml/min, 50 [16-84] ml/min, and 327 [ 179 - 834] kcal/day at 85 % FiO 2. Analysis was performed in 12 subjects at 85 % FiO 2as E-COVX was unable to measure EE in 4 subjects. Mean \u00b1 SD changes in VO 2, VCO 2and EE within device from 21 to 85 % as percentage of mean were 11 \u00b1 6 %(p < 0.001), 3 \u00b1 6 % (p = 0.11) and 9 \u00b1 6 % (p < 0.001) for Beacon Care- system, and 4 \u00b1 14 % (p = 0.415), 16 \u00b1 10 % (p < 0.001) and 9\u00b1 12 % (p = 0.017) for E-COVX.Conclusions: Measurements of VO 2, VCO 2and EE were comparable between Beacon Caresystem and E-COVX at 21 and 50 % FiO 2. Sig- nificant differences were observed at 85 % FiO 2where E-COVX slightly underestimated VCO 2and EE and slightly overestimated VO 2and EE. Only Beacon Caresystem allowed EE measurement at 85 % FiO 2in all 16 subjects. References 1. Goiburu ME et al.

Wollersheim - Berlin Institute of Health (BIH), Berlin, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A498 Introduction: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a com- mon lung disease. Extracorporeal lung support (ECLS) can be an add- itional lifesaving tool. Patients with severe ARDS often suffer from a catabolic state with massive loss of weight including skeletal muscle and fat tissue. For ICU patients in general there is evidence, that goal directed feeding could improve outcome and indirect calorimetry (IC) is the gold standard to measure resting energy expenditure (REE). Due to the O2 uptake and CO2 removal by lung and ECLS, an IC in the common way is not feasible. So far it is unclear if and which impact ECLS has on caloric needs of patients with ARDS. Objectives: We introduce our MEEP (Measuring Energy Expenditure in ECMO Patients) protocol, which enables us to determine the REE in patients with ECLS. We investigated the impact of ECLS in ARDS patients on REE. Methods: We perform a common IC and extend it by a calculation of the O2 uptake and the CO2 elimination by the ECMO filter due to blood gas analyses (BGAs) and the ECMO blood flow [1]. Sum O2 up- take and CO2 elimination were used in the equation of Weir [2] to calculate REE. With this protocol we performed a monocentric, con- trolled, prospective, observational pilot study. We included 20 pa- tients with ARDS and ECMO treatment and 20 matched ARDS patients without ECLS as control. Informed consent was given by legal proxy. The COSMED Quark RMR\u00ae was used to perform IC, BGAs were done by ABL Flex 800 and filter blood flow was measured by the ECMO device. For all patients we measured resting energy ex- penditure and calculated the most prevalent predicting equations for REE for comparison. Nonparametric tests were performed. Data were shown as median [IQR]. P-values 0.05 are assumed as being signifi- cant. Ethic vote(EA1/293/13). Results: Patient\u00b4s baseline characteristics were without significant dif- ferences except SOFA Score at time-point of measurement for pa- tients with ECMO 12.5 [8.0/14.5] and without ECMO 7.5 [6.0/9.5] (p = 0.002). We report that our MEEP-protocol is safe, easy and feasible to perform in ECMO patients. We show for the first time, that measured REE values according to our MEEP protocol do not significantly differ between ARDS patients with ECMO (2013 kcal/d [1786/2333]) [1602/2085]) (p = 0.165). All investigated equations predicting REE do not fit the measured REE according to the MEEP protocol neither in non-ECMO patients (data not shown) nor in ECMO patients. Conclusions: Due to our MEEP-protocol REE is easy measurable in ARDS patients with ECLS. ECMO per se does not to influence REE. Equations to estimate caloric needs do not fit the REE of critically ill patients with ECMO. We recommend to implement sequential mea- surements of REE in critically ill during ECMO treatment to improve goal directed feeding.Trauma critical care A499 CRASH-2 from the coal face - experience from a major trauma centre in the United Kingdom A. Lee, R. Inglis, R. Morgan, G. Barker John Radcliffe Hospital, Adult Intensive Care Unit, Oxford, UK Correspondence: A. Lee - John Radcliffe Hospital, Adult Intensive Care Unit, Oxford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A499 Introduction: The administration of tranexamic acid to trauma pa- tients with risk of haemorrhage is one of only seven treatments shown to improve mortality in critically ill patients in multi-centre randomized controlled trials [1,2]. Nonetheless, four years on from CRASH-2, the implementation of this simple, low risk intervention, which has the potential to save 600 lives a year in the UK, remains suboptimal [3]. Objectives: To measure the proportion of trauma patients deemed to be at risk of haemorrhage (as evidenced by the administration of a first dose of tranexamic acid) that correctly received the second dose of tranexamic acid. We designed a quality improvement project to improve compliance with this measure, and here we report pre- liminary Results: Methods: All patients admitted under a 'trauma call' between Janu- ary 2015 and January 2016 at the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, a major trauma centre in the United Kingdom, were included in our study. Tranexamic acid administration information was collected for all patients. Interventions included disseminating tranexamic acid in- formation to trauma doctors verbally and during departmental induc- tion. We also added both doses of tranexamic acid into the electronic prescribing bundle for trauma patients in our hospital. Fur- ther interventions are ongoing. Results: The John Radcliffe Hospital received 1373 patients as 'trauma calls' between January 2015 and January 2016. Of the 184 patients who received the first dose of tranexamic acid, 82 patients correctly received the second dose (45 %). We present a run-chart of percentage of pa- tients receiving both doses of tranexamic acid over time, out of all the patients who received the first dose of tranexamic acid. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that a majority of patients who would have received two doses of tranexamic acid under the terms of CRASH 2 are not receiving this life-saving treatment. This finding highlighted the difficulty in translating evidence-based recommenda- tions into everyday practice and the need for quality improvement pro- jects in this area. Responsibility for the administration of tranexamic acid lies across multiple specialties, and so measures to improve its ad- ministration need to target a diverse group of healthcare staff. En- gaging stakeholders from all relevant parties has proved challenging Fig. 34 (abstract A498). Resting energy expenditure in ECMO patientsIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 259 of 607and an early focus on inter-specialty collaboration is our key recom- mendation to centres who intend to implement similar initiatives.

Kamata - Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Government of Japan, Tuberculosis and Infectious Diseases Control, Tokyo, Japan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A500 Introduction: Emergency physicians are required to assess the sever- ity of patient's illness and predict their prognosis with restricted situ- ation at emergency department (ED). Trauma is one of the most severe injuries at ED and its outcome highly depends on initial ap- propriate management. Therefore, several scoring systems have been developed on the last decade. However, the environment on ED has changed and physicians have been still occasionally misled. Objectives: Vital signs are widely used in both emergency medical service and ED. It is a role of not only the static parameter but also the dynamic one to help emergency physicians classify trauma pa- tients' severity. Thus, we aimed to analyze the association between changes in vital sings ( VS) and in-hospital mortality among trauma patients. Methods: This study was multicenter observational retrospective study from Japan Trauma Data Bank. It consisted of major emer- gency hospitals in Japan from January 2004 to December 2013. In this period, a total of 159,157 trauma patients were registered. Of these, 75,833 patients (48 %) were analyzed since all vital signs (sys- tolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate) were available both at site and at ED.We developed a new scoring system to predict in-hospital mortality for trauma patients using three VS and age. The patients were judged on these 4 items with one point added for each positive one; when systolic blood pressure decreased more than 30 mmHg, heart rate increased more than 20/min, respiratory rate increased 10/min, or old (age 65). Results: Mean age (\u00b1SD) was 54 (\u00b124) years old. 29,309 (39 %) were aged over 65 years old. 25,854 (34 %) were women. Overall, in- hospital mortality rate was 5,834 (7.7 %). The in-hospital mortality rate increased from 6.4 % to 18.9 % when systolic blood pressure de- creased more than 30 mmHg. In a similar way, it increased from 7.0 % to 16.5 % when heart rates increased 20/min. Also, it increased from 7.5 % to 10.7 % when respiratory rates increase 10/min. Old patients (> = 65 years old) had severe outcome than young adults (it increased from 5.1 % to 11.8 %). As using our scoring system, in- hospital mortality rate increased: 0 point was 3.5 %; 1 point was 9.5 %; 2 points was 18.5 %; 3 points was 33.0 %; and 4 points was 48.6 %. The area under the ROC curve of this predictive model was 0.675 (95 % CI 0.668-0.683). Conclusions: Our new trauma scoring system, VS scoring system, which focus on changing vital signs, predicts in-hospital mortality. It is useful to improve that emergency physician's decision and identifi- cation of patients who need critical care. References 1. Kondo et al. Critical Care 2011,15:R191 2. Mehmood et al.

Green - Dalhousie University, Nova Scotia Trauma Program, Halifax, Canada Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A501 Introduction: Systemic hypotension is a predictor of increased mor- tality in patients with traumatic brain injuries. Post-intubation hypotension (PIH) has been demonstrated to be common and associated with poor patient outcomes in other critically ill patient populations requiring emergent endotracheal intubation (ETI). The importance of PIH remains unclear in the trauma population. Objectives: To determine the incidence of PIH in adult trauma pa- tients and assess the association of PIH with mortality. Methods: This study was a retrospective case series of adult (16 years) trauma patients requiring intubation after referral to a provincial trauma team located in a level 1 center in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada between 2000 and 2015. PIH was defined as (a) de- crease in systolic blood pressure (SBP) to < 90 mmHg; (b) reduction in SBP of 20 % from baseline; (c) decrease in mean arterial pressure to < 60 mmHg; or (d) initiation of, or increased infusion dosage of, any vasopressor medication (bolus or infusion) during the 15-minute period after ETI. Data was collected from a provincial trauma registry and the patient chart, and included demographics, co-morbidities, trauma characteristics, intubation time, as well as all fluids, medica- tions, adverse events, interventions, and vital signs during the 15 mi- nutes before/after ETI. We evaluated the incidence of PIH and created a logistic regression model to determine the likelihood of mortality in the PIH and non-PIH groups after controlling for gender, age, intubator, mechanism of trauma, injury severity, traumatic brain injury and volume of fluid administered. Results: Overall, 477 patients arrived unintubated and required ETI by the trauma team over the study period, of which 444 patients met eligibility criteria and were included in the analysis. The inci- dence of PIH was 35.6 % (158/444) in our study population. In- Fig. 35 (abstract A499). Run Chart TxA Audit Jan 2015 -Jan 2016Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 260 of 607hospital mortality occurred in 47 (29.7 %) in the PIH group, compared to 45 (15.7 %) in the non-PIH group. After controlling for possible confounding factors, the development of PIH was associatedwith increased mortality (OR = 2.17; CI: {1.25, 3.77}; P = 0.006).Conclusions: In our study, development of PIH was common (35.6 %) and associated with increased mortality (OR 2.17). Clinicians should attempt to minimize hemodynamic instability during ETI in patientswith traumatic injuries. Further investigation of PIH in the traumapopulation is warranted. References 1.

Jae Gil Yonsei University College of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Seoul,Republic of KoreaCorrespondence: H. Tae Hwa - Yonsei University College of Medicine, Department of Surgery, Seoul, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A502 Introduction: Recently, the population of elderly people has been in- creasing rapidly all over the world. Especially, Republic of Korea is now progressing to an aging society. The social activities of theaging population have increased, which has also increased the num-ber of elderly patients injured. Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze the clinical characteris- tics and injury pattern of geritaric patients involved in trauma.Methods: This study was conducted retrospectively from January 2015 to March 2016 among trauma patients who visited single trauma center in Seoul, Korea. The patients divided in two groups, a geriatrics group and an adult group on the basis of an age of 65. Pa-tients under 18 years of age were excluded. The variables relatedwith trauma were extracted and compared. Results: Total number of the included patients was 384, and the number of elderly patients was 74. There were no significant differ-ences in Revised Trauma Score (RTS), intensive care unit (ICU) admis-sion, hospital stay between the two groups. There were differences in the mechanism and the locations of the injury, gender, injury se- verity score (ISS), trauma and injury severity score (TRISS), mortality,drinking at admission between the two groups. Most common injurymechanism in the adult group was driver traffic accident (24.5 %) and in the geriatric group was pedestrian traffic accident (45.9 %). In- jury of extremity (44.8 % vs 59.5 %) (p = 0.028) was more common inthe geriatric group than in the adult group. And female patient wasmore common in the geriatric group (26.8 % vs 40.5 %) (p = 0.020). The average ISS of the geriatric group was higher than that of the adult group (17.8+/ 11.52 vs. 14.0+/ 12.06, p = 0.015). The mortality was higher in the geriatric group (14.9 %) than in the adult group(4.5 %) (p = 0.003). But drinking at admission was higher in the adult group (33.9 % vs 10.8 %) (p < 0.00). Conclusions: The mortality rate and the average ISS were greater within the geriatric group than the adult group despite there was nodifference in the RTS, ICU admission. Also elderly people were prone to pedestrian traffic accident with the lower drinking rate compare than the adult group.Prediction models and outcome A503Sequential sofa score as predictor of outcome in septic patients R. Hern\u00e1ndez Vaquero1, E. Rodriguez-Ruiz1, A. Lopez Vaquero Cl\u00ednico Universitario, Intensive Care Unit, Santiago de Compostela, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A503 Introduction: Sepsis is a dynamic medical condition where patients\u00b4 clinical status can change rapidly in either direction. Different bio- markers and scores have been studied to assess sepsis severity andprognosis .Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 are bio- markers referred as helpful to follow evolution and outcomes. APA- CHE II model was developed to predict hospital outcomes, based on data from the first 24 hours. SOFA score describes the degree oforgan dysfunction over time and evaluates morbidity, but has beenused also for predicting mortality. Objective: Our aim was to study the ability of different biomarkers (procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6) and scores (APA-CHE II and SOFA), determined on day 1, to predict outcome in septicpatients. Besides, we studied sequential SOFA score to find out its dynamics at early sepsis and its correlation with mortality. Methods: We assessed 48 consecutive septic patients admitted to our medico-surgical ICU. Procalcitonin, C -reactive protein and interleukin-6 were determined on day 1. APACHE II was calculated on day 1, and daily SOFA score was calculated for 5 consecutive days, determining also the maximum SOFA. Mann -Whitney U test and ROC curves were carried out to study association of these variables with 28-day mortality.Results: In our cohort of septic patients (mean age 69 \u00b1 13) there were 43 survivors and 5 non-survivors. Procalcitonin, C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 did not show correlation with 28-day mortality. APACHE II,SOFA scores on days 1 and 2, and maximum SOFA, also showed no cor-relation with 28-day mortality. However, when analyzing SOFA scores on days 3, 4 and 5, we found significant lower scores in survivors compared to non-survivors: SOFA-3 ( p=0 . 0 4 8 ) ,S O F A - 4( p=0 . 0 1 6 ) ,a n dS O F A - 5( p= 0.018). The ROC curve analysis also showed association with values for procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, APACHE II and SOFA did not correlate with outcome.But, low SOFA scores on day 3, and specially in days 4 and 5, are good predictors of survival, meaning that after 48 hours of admis- sion, regardless of the initial score, those patients with a low SOFAscore have higher probability to survive. While SOFA scores at admis-sion, and maximum SOFA, had bad performance in predicting mor- tality, sequential SOFA scores add information on the course of the disease, and improve the ability to predict the likelihood of survival.Larger studies are required to find out SOFA based prediction modelswith improved accuracy.

Risk adjustment models [1] enable ad- justed outcome comparisons and benchmarks between regions, hos- pitals, or over time. For Germany we recently reported first results of an administrative data Approach [2] but a risk model is lacking. Objectives: To develop and asses a risk model of hospital mortality for sepsis based on German hospital claims data. Methods: The hospital claims data of almost all inpatients in Germany is combined into one dataset at the Federal Statistical Of- fice. Anonymized statistical analysis can be performed via remote data access. In data from 2010 -2013 all adult cases with pathogen- based or clinical sepsis codes (A & R codes, ICD-10) were classified by severity. Age, sex, type of hospital admission, coded foci of infection and comorbidities based on categories of the Charlson and Elixhau- ser comorbidity indices, coding of sepsis as main diagnosis and year of treatment were assessed as possible risk factors. Predictors of hos- pital mortality were identified by backwards binary logistic regression in a derivation cohorts separately for each severity group. Perform- ance of models was tested in validation cohorts. Models were then fitted with the selected predictors for the different severities in all cases and predicted mortality risk was calculated. Combined model performance across all severities was assessed by discrimination using the \"area under the curve \"(AUC), by calibration plotting ob- served against predicted mortality over risk quantiles, and by ex- plained variance. Results: 441 207 cases with sepsis without organ dysfunction (hospital mortality 13,5 %), 284 883 with severe sepsis (mortality 40,3 %) and 112 609 with septic shock (mortality 59,6 %) were identified. 41 -43 of 53 assessed predictors remained in the final models. Overall discrimination (Fig. 36), explained variance (R2= 0.25), and calibration (Fig. 37) were good. Strongest risk factors were age and advanced liver and hemato-oncologic disease. A urogenital focus and sepsis as main diagnosis were associated with lower hospital mortality. Mortality decreased from 2010 to 2013 for sepsis (p < 0.0001) and severe sepsis (p < 0.0001) but not for septic shock (p = 0.11). Conclusions: We developed a well performing risk adjustment model for sepsis mortality in German administrative data. This enables com- parisons and benchmarks from administrative data in Germany. Hos- pital characteristics will be included into the model in the next development step. References 1. Ford DW et al. Critical care medicine 2016 2. Fleischmann C et al.

Relevant studies from Janu- ary 2000 to December 2015 were obtained from electronic data-bases. Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic accuracy (STARD) andQuality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies instrument (QUA- DAS-2) were used to assess individual study quality and bias. Med- Calc statistic software was used to assess and combine the data anddiagnostic accuracy across studies. Pooled diagnostic odds ratio andarea under The ROC Curve (AUC) analysis was used to evaluate the prognostic accuracy of MEWS tool. Results: A total of 402 citations were identified yielding 16 studies for inclusion in this systematic review. Studies were significantly het-erogeneous in terms of age and sample size. For predicting in- hospital death, MEWS with high risk group as cut-off 4 and 5 had the Diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 14.278 (95 % Confidence Interval[CI] %). On pooled AUC analysis, there was a trend for MEWS to estimate fair at the discriminative power of test. AUC of MEWS 4 was to On Meta-analysis of sixteen of MEWS studies, this showed a robust positive trend to predict in-hospital death. MEWS equal 4 or greater may be the favored tool to alert the deteriorationin hospitalized patients.Grant acknowledgement Nursing Department, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross SoceityNote: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [1].

A506 Validation of SAPS 3 E APACHE II in elderly patients admitted to brazilian intensive care Brazil;2Universidade - UNIFACS, N\u00facleo de Pesquisa Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A506 Introduction: The world population is ageing. Together with this fact there is increase rate of elderly patient's admissions to Intensive CareUnits. Therefore, studies aimed in elderly population are important.The prognostic scores have been widely used in intensive care medi- cine, among them SAPS 3 and APACHE II have a significant import- ance. The sensitivity and specificity of all the systems are varydepending on the score systems and the different groups ofpatients. Objectives: Validate and compare SAPS 3 and APACHE II in elderly patients admitted in ICU in Salvador-BA, Brazil.Methods: Prospective cohort study placed in a general ICU. In the study were included patients above age of 65 admitted to general ICU, from March 2010 to May 2013. All the patients were assessed using the SAPS 3 (Global Equation and Central & South AmericanEquation) and APACHE II scoring systems. Logistic regressions ana-lysis was used to calculate the sensitivity, specificity and accuracy as well as the OR probability of mortality. The ability to predict mortality was performed with ROC curves. The differences between observed-to-predicted mortality were analyzed with the Hosmer-Lemeshowtest.Results: There were analyzed 1106 patients, 497 (44.9 %) males. Me- dian age: 76 years (IQR: 71 -83 years). Hospital mortality 207 (18.7 %). Median SAPS 3 and APACHE II: 48 (IQR: 42 -55), 14 (IQR: 11 -18). The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were respectively 70 %, 68.7 %and 71.4 % for SAPS 3 Global Equation; 70 %, 68.7 % and 71.4 % for SAPS 3 Central & South American Equation (CSA); 67.6 %, 69.1 % and 68.81 % for APACHE II. The area under the curve (AUC) of thesemodels was: 0.748 for SAPS 3 Global Equation, for 3 Cen-tral & South American Equation (CSA) and 0.740 for APACHE II. But the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test H statistic also revealed poor performance for SAPS 3 Central & South American Equation(CSA) scoring system.Conclusions: In our series, the SAPS 3 Global Equation is the model that best predicts mortality in patients with at least 65 years admit- ted to a Brazilian ICU. Also, SAPS 3 Central & South American Equa-tion (CSA) revealed poor calibration for critical care elderly patients. References 1- Sacanella E, P\u00e9rez-Castej\u00f3n JM, Nicol\u00e1s JM et al.

StenhouseQueen Elizabeth University Hospital, Anaesthetics and Intensive Care,Glasgow, UK Correspondence: L. Gemmell - Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, Anaesthetics and Intensive Care, Glasgow, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A507 Introduction: Recent guidelines on the definition of sepsis from the Sepsis 3 working group have suggested the use of a simplified ver-sion of the SOFA score as an initial way to screen for sepsis (1). Thisscore allocates a point each for new altered mentation (GCS < 15), re- spiratory rate greater than 22 and a systolic blood pressure < 100 mmHg. It has been given the term qSOFA based on the originalSOFA (sepsis related organ failure assessment). The purpose of thescore is to identify patients early with sepsis as dealy in recognition is associated with an increased mortality and increased length of stay. We decided to evaluate whether the qSOFA score when appliedto ICU patients could be validated for use in our patient population.Methods: A historical patient cohort was identified by searching the WardWatcher CIS dataset for all patients admitted from 01/01/204 - 31/12/2014 to a five bedded teaching hospital Intensive Care Unit inGlasgow. These patients demographic data was collected along withthe parameters from qSOFA (as above) along with outcome data. After removal of patients with incomplete datasets, statistical analysis was performed.Results: There were 3357 patients included in the study, with ana- lysis of 1353 due to incomplete qSOFA data. Baeline data for these patients was as follows: 58.9 % male, mean age 57.4 +/ 0.9 years, mean APACHE-II score 19.7 +/ 0.5, mean predicted mortality 37 +/ 1.5 %, mean length of stay 5.0 +/ 0. days and mortality of 33 %. Using the available data from Wardwatcher we generated qSOFA data as below. Conclusions: As can be seen from above there is a good correlation between the qSOFA and APACHE-II in terms of recognition of sever-ity. There is a significant correlation between qSOFA and increased length of stay and mortality. This would suggest that qSOFA is a quick and useful tool that can be used on ICU admission to aid prog-nostication which can assist in discussions with patients, relativesand colleagues.

Plummer - Royal Adelaide Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Adelaide, Australia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A508 Introduction: Hyperglycaemia occurs frequently in the critically ill and may be secondary to either diabetes (recognised or not), or stress induced hyperglycaemia. Stress induced hyperglycaemia oc- curs in patients who have normal glucose tolerance following reso-lution of their acute illness. Whether stress induced hyperglycaemiaunmasks latent insulin resistance and/or impaired -cell function has not been adequately explored. Objectives: To evaluate the association between stress induced hyperglycaemia, the development of diabetes and long-term mortal-ity in survivors of critical illness. Methods: This is a retrospective, multi-centre observational study. All adult patients surviving admission to a tertiary intensive care unit(ICU) in South Australia between 2004 and 2011 were included.Stress induced hyperglycaemia was defined as a blood glucose 11.1 mmol/l within the first 24 hours of ICU admission. Prevalent dia- betes was identified through ICD-10 coding or prior registration withthe Australian National Diabetes Service Scheme (NDSS). Incident dia-betes was identified as NDSS registration > 30 days after hospital dis- charge until July 2015. The predicted risk of developing diabetes was described as sub-hazard ratios using competing risk regression. Sur-vival was assessed using Cox proportional hazards regression.Results: Stress induced hyperglycaemia was identified in 2,883 (17 %) of 17,074 patients without diabetes. The overall incidence of subsequent type 2 diabetes following critical illness was 4.8 % (821of 17,074). The risk of diabetes in patients with stress induced hyper-glycaemia was approximately double that of those without (HR 1.91 (95 % CI 1.62, 2.26), p< 0.001) and was sustained regardless of age or severity of illness. Subdividing age into approximate deciles thegreatest risk was seen in the 50 -59 year age group with over a seven-fold risk (HR 7.90 (5.38, 11.60), p< 0.001). Stress induced hyper- glycaemia was not associated with increased long-term mortality in patients who survived their hospital admission.Conclusions: Stress induced hyperglycaemia within 24 hours of ad- mission to the ICU identifies patients at greater risk of subsequent diabetes.Grant acknowledgement This project was supported by grants from the Diabetes Australia Re- search Trust and a University of Adelaide, Discipline of Acute CareMedicine Maurice Sando Project Grant.

Yatabe - Kochi Medical School, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Nankoku, Japan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A509 Introduction: Although several clinical guidelines recommend main- taining blood glucose between 144 and 180 mg/dL, these are insuffi-cient evidences to assess the benefit and harm of this glycemic target.Objectives: We conducted a network meta-analysis to assess the impact of glycemic target 144-180 mg/dL o n the incidence of hypoglycemia, the risk of infection and mortality in compared with other glycemic tar-get as < 110 mg/dL, 110-144 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL.Methods: We considered all studies from three recent systematic re- views [1 -3] and searched the PubMed database for studies that com- pared target blood glucose levels among critically ill patients.The primary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, and the secondaryoutcomes were the incidence of hypoglycemia, and risk of sepsis or bloodstream infection. Results: We identified 71 studies through the re-analysis of the three systematic reviews, and 431 studies through the PubMed search. Thirty-nine potentially eligible studies were considered for inclusion, although 12 studies were excluded after screening the full texts. Thus, the net- work meta-analysis included 14,495 patients from 27 studies. The meanpatient age was 61.6 years, and 21.7 % of the patients had diabetes.There was no significant difference of in-hospital mortality and risk of sepsis or bloodstream infection among 3 glycemic bands (<110 mg/dL, 110-144 -180 mg/dL had significantly lower in-hospital mortality and risk of sepsis or bloodstream infection in compared with >180 mg/dL (odds ratio [OR]:0.82, 95 % 0.69, 95 CI: 0.52-0.92, respectively). Our network meta-analysis revealed that targetblood glucose levels of < 110 mg/dL and 110 -144 mg/dL were associ- ated with a 6 -7 fold higher risk of hypoglycemia, compared to targets of 144 -180 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL. There were no significant differ- ences in the risk of hypoglycemia between < 110 mg/dL and 110 - 144 mg/dL (OR = 0.76 (95 % CI: 0.49-1.11). There were also no signifi-cant differences in the risk of hypoglycemia between and between 144 -180 mg/dL and >180 mg/dL (OR = 1.0 (95 % CI: 0.30-2.70). The rank probability analysis indicated that a target blood glucose level of 144 - 180 mg/dL had the highest probability of being the best target bloodglucose level for reducing hypoglycemia and hospital mortality rates and was the second best target level, following a target level of 110 - 144 mg/dL, for reducing sepsis or bloodstream infection rates.Conclusions: The results of our network meta-analysis indicate that tar- get blood glucose levels of 144 -180 mg/dL is an optimal target for balan- cing the risks and benefits of insulin therapy among critically ill patients.

Ali Abdelhamid - University of Adelaide, Discipline of Acute Care Medicine, Adelaide, Australia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A510 Introduction: Diabetes is a risk factor for the development and sever- ity of critical illness, and the need for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admis- sion. Despite this, diabetes does not confer a greater risk of death for those with critical illness within the index hospital admission. How- ever, long-term outcomes in patients with diabetes who survive ICU admission remain unknown. Objectives: Our objectives were to evaluate the effect of diabetes on both long-term survival rates and average years of life lost for pa- tients admitted to ICU and who survived hospitalisation. Methods: We evaluated all adult patients in South Australia between 2004 and 2011 who survived hospitalisation requiring admission to a Public Hospital ICU. Demographic and admission data from the Australia and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Adult Patient Data- base were linked to population based datasets to match (i) Inter- national Classification of Disease (ICD-10) codes for diabetes through the Department of Health Integrated South Australian Activity Collec- tion dataset, (ii) diabetes diagnosis in the national register (the National Diabetes Service Scheme), and (iii) mortality through the Australian Na- tional Death Index. Life years lost were calculated using age and sex specific life-tables from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Data are presented as frequencies and proportions for categorical variables and mean (standard deviation) or median [interquartile range] for continuous variables. Between group comparisons were performed by t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum or Chi-square tests. Longitu- using Cox proportional hazards regres- sion and average life years lost by linear regression. Results: 5451 patients with and 17022 patients without diabetes were included. Patients with diabetes were older (64.7 (14.9) vs 57.6 (19.7) years; p < 0.0001) and had higher illness severity on admission to ICU (APACHE III 62 [48, 80] vs 54 [38, 72]; p < 0.0001). rates [95%CI] were 105.5 [101.6-109.6] and 67.6 [65.9-69.3] per 1000 person years for those with and without diabetes respectively. Patients with diabetes were more likely to die after hospital discharge (un- adjusted hazard ratio 1.52 [95 % CI 1.46-1.59]; p < 0.001) (Fig. 38). Diabetes remained an independent risk factor for death when ad- justed for age, sex, site, indigenous status, APACHE III score and ad- mission diagnosis (hazard ratio 1.17 [95 % CI 1.12-1.22]; p < 0.01). Patients with diabetes also suffered a greater number of average life years lost and this was most marked in the 4thand 5thdecades of life (Fig. 39). Conclusions: Mortality and number of life years lost for ICU survivors with diabetes is greater than for survivors without diabetes. Strat- egies to improve outcomes for these patients should be evaluated. GRANT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT Dr Ali Abdelhamid is supported by a Royal Adelaide Hospital Clarkson Scholarship.

Egi, S. Mizobuchi Kobe University Hospital, Anesthesiology, Kobe, Japan Correspondence: M. Hokka - Kobe University Hospital, Anesthesiology, Kobe, Japan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A511 Introduction: Glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is used to estimate chronic glycemic control. Recently, several studies suggested that the optimal glycemic control in acutely ill patients might be better being adjusted according to the premorbid chronic glycemic control (1 -3). However, the majority of patients would not have been measured the HbA1c-level prior to the acute illness. As the HbA1c-level would be affected by the patients' conditions, HbA1c-levels during an acute illness may not reflect the actual premorbid glycemic status. Only limited research has been conducted so far to assess the value of HbA1c-levels during the state of an acute illness to estimate the pre- morbid glycemic control (4). Fig. 38 (abstract A510). Fig. 39 (abstract A510).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 265 of 607Objectives: Assessment of the relationship between HbA1c during the state of an acute illness and HbA1c levels measured within 30 days before an acute illness. Methods: These are retrospective observational studies. The Ethics Committee of the Kobe University Hospital approved this investigation. The committee waived the need for informed consent concerning studies involving the use of databases. We screened patients' HbA1c levels that were measured within 30 days prior to an emergency sur- gery, requiring general anesthesia. Among them, we selected patients whose HbA1c levels were also measured on the day of the surgery. Thus we obtained HbA1c-levels measured within 30 days before the emergency surgery (preHbA1c) and on the day of the surgery (opeH- bA1c). Those HbA1c-levels were measured in the same laboratory. The correlations of the two HbA1c levels were assessed, using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Agreement between the two HbA1c-levels was assessed using the Bland-Altman approach. Results: We studied 100 HbA1c-levels in 50 patients. The patients were 66.8 years old in average. 31 of them were male patients (62 %). 38 out of 50 patients (76 %) were required emergency cardio- vascular surgery. PreHbA1c was measured 11.4 days before the emer- gency operation. The average preHbA1c was 6.3 % and the opeHbA1c was 6.2 %. There is a significant correlation between preHbA1c and opeHbA1c (r = 0.83, p < 0.001). The mean difference between preHbA1c and opeHbA1c was 0.1 % (95 % confidential interval; 1.2 % to 0.9 %). This difference of the two HbA1c did not correlate with the time between the two measurements (r = 0.17, p = 0.29). Conclusions: The HbA1c-level on the day of surgery is a useful marker of premorbid glycemic control in patients requiring emer- gency surgery.

Kar - University of Adelaide, Discipline of Acute Care Medicine, Adelaide, Australia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A512 Introduction: Hypoglycaemia during ICU admission is associated with adverse outcomes after discharge. In both health and patients with dia- betes, acute hypoglycaemia triggers counter-regulatory responses in- creasing cardiac contractility and accelerating gastric emptying. However, antecedent hypoglycaemia attenuat es endogenous catecholamine and vagal responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia1. Accordingly, patients who were hypoglycaemic during ICU may be unable to mount a physio- logical response to hypoglycaemia once discharged from ICU. Objectives: To determine the effects of antecedent hypoglycaemia on cardiac and gastric responses to subsequent hypoglycaemia in health. Methods: Ten healthy men (age 22.5 (1.0) years, BMI 23.8 (0.5) kg/m2) were studied on two occasions, lasting 30 hours, separated by 6 weeks a n dr a n d o m i s e dt oe i t h e r' c o n t r o l '( D a y1( C1) - three euglycaemic clamps at a blood glucose of 6 mmol/L followed day 2 ( C2) - one hypoglycaemic clamp 2.8 mmol/L), or 'antecedent hypoglycaemia' (Day 1 ( AH1)-t h r e e clamps at blood glucose of 2.8 mmol/L followed by day 2 ( AH2)-o n e clamp at 2.8 mmol/L). Cardiac contractility was measured using fractionalshortening (FS) via 2D echocardiography on days 1 and 2 of the control (FSC1and FS C2) and antecedent hypoglycaemia (FS AH1and FS AH2)p e - riods. Gastric emptying (GE) was measured on day 1 and day 2, for both control (GE C1and GE C2) and antecedent hypoglycaemia (GE AH1 and GEAH2) periods, using scintigraphy, following ingestion of a stan- dardised meal consisting of 100 g of minced beef labelled with 20 MBq 99mtechnetium-sulphur colloid. Radioisotopic data were acquired for 180 minutes. Data are mean (SE). Results: Fractional shortening was greater (FS C2vs. FS C1, P < 0.01) and gastric emptying faster (GE C2 AUC vs. GE C1 AUC , P = 0.01) during acute, single episode hypoglycaemia compared to euglycaemia. When testing the effect of antecedent hypoglycaemia compared to a single episode of hypoglycaemia, fractional shortening may be atten- uated (FS AH2 vs. FS C2, P = 0.06), whereas gastric emptying was un- affected (GE AH2 AUC vs. GE C2 AUC , P = 0.74) (Figs. 40and 41). Conclusions: In health, the increase in cardiac contractility during acute hypoglycaemia may be affected by antecedent hypoglycaemia whereas acceleration of gastric emptying during acute hypoglycaemia does not appear to be affected by antecedent was unaffected. These data suggest that antecedent hypoglycaemia during ICU may have \"downstream \"effects after discharge. References 1. Heller SR, Cryer PE.

However, a consensus exists concerning arterial carbon dioxide pressure (pCO 2) that would represent respiratory part of this equilibrium1. Stewart described this parameter as \"independent\", in contrast to \"dependent\" parameters, e.g. pH and HCO 32. Objectives: The primary objective of this experimental trial is to dem- onstrate that lactic acid infusion increase pCO 2. This would be incon- sistent with Stewart approach. Methods: After local ethical committee approval, 9 anesthetized, cura- rized and mechanically ventilated piglets were studied. Lactic acid infu- sion (0.33 mmol.kg1.min1) was administered. Each 3 minutes, an arterial gasometry was done. Each minute, the following parameters were col- lected: mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac output measured by trans- pulmonary thermodilution (CO), pulse oxymetry (SpO 2) and end-tidal CO2(EtCO 0.03*pCO 6.1. Total tCO 2= HCO 3+ 0.03*pCO 2 The primary endpoints were pCO 2increase and tCO 2stability. To test the hypothesis of normal distribution, Shapiro Wilk test was applied. The p values were obtained from ANOVA analyses. p < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: The results were: a decrease in pH (p < 0.001) (Fig. 42a), an in- crease in pCO 2(p = (Fig. a decrease in HCO 3(p = 0.015) (Fig. 42d) without significant alteration in tCO 2(p = 0.08) (Fig. 42c). We also observed: an EtCO = (Fig. 42e) and lactatemia (p < 0.001) (Fig. 42f). CO (p = 0.052), MAP (p = 0.506) and SpO2 (p = 0.905) were not significantly altered. Conclusions: This in vivo metabolic acidosis model with stable mi- nute ventilation shows an increase in pCO 2without significant alter- ation in tCO 2. Although these results were biochemically predictable, they question one of the basements of Stewart approach, that con- sidered pCO 2as an independent parameter. In our study, pCO 2 seems a dependent parameter. tCO 2, too often neglected parameter, seems an independent parameter.

Several studies have demon- strated that balanced fluids are commonly used for volume ex- pansion of critically ill patients who may also have impaired liver function (1,2). Little is known of the metabolic fate of this anions when the primary metabolising organ is compromised. Moreover, the role of gluconate embedded in PlasmaLyte in terms of acid - base control is unknown. Fig. 42 (abstract A513).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 267 of 607Objectives: This study investigated the role of the liver in the efficacy of balanced and unbalanced solutions to correct acid - base alterations and renal haemodynamics and microvascular oxygenation in a rat Ringer's Plasma-Lyte (PL) or normal saline (NS) were administered following HS in the presence or absence of a 70 % partial liver resection (PLR). Renal haemodynamics and microvascular oxygenation (by oxygen- dependent quenching of phosphorescence) were measured as well as levels of lactate, gluconate and acetate in plasma and urine. Kidney wet and dry weighing was also assessed. Results: PLR resulted in increased liver enzymes compared in control and HS groups (p < 0.01). HS decreased systemic and renal haemo- dynamics and reduced microvascular kidney oxygenation to 20 and 14 mmHg for cortex and medulla respectively, associated with lactic acidosis (p < 0.01). Resuscitation with balanced fluids did not fully restore renal oxygenation (p < 0.01). RA and PL in- creased bicarbonate levels (15.5 \u00b1 1.1 and 16.4 \u00b1 1.6 vs 13.4 \u00b1 2.0 and 11.5 \u00b1 2.5 mmol/L) and restored pH better than RL or NS (7.29 \u00b1 0.09 and 7.30 \u00b1 0.04 vs 7.22 \u00b1 0.12 and 7.14 \u00b1 0.09) re- spectively in the PLR experiment (p < 0.01). PLR caused an in- crease in plasma gluconate after PL resuscitation (10.4 \u00b1 2.8 vs 13.8 \u00b1 5.1 g/L p < 0.05). Conclusions: Acetate buffered balanced fluids show superior buff- ering effects than RL and NS. Gluconate is partially metabolized by the liver although it does not contribute to acid -base control because of large excretion in urine. Acetate is metabolized regardless of liver function and may be the most efficient bicar- bonate precursor. Lactate infusion tends to overwhelm the me- tabolism capacities of the residual liver. NS seemed to be the most unsuitable fluid when compared to balanced fluids, even in cases of liver failure. References 1. Cecconi M et al.

Cioccari - Lucerne Cantonal Hospital, Department of Intensive Care, Lucerne, Switzerland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A515 Introduction: Recent evidence suggests that a more liberal glycemic control (target blood glucose level between 10 and 14 mmol/l) maybe beneficial in patients with diabetes adapted to chronic hypergly- cemia (glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] >7 %)1. However, whether such liberal strategies leads to relative insulin deficiency, acceleratedketone body production and ketoacidosis is uncertain. Accordingly,we conducted a prospective observational study to explore the inci- dence of ketosis, ketonuria and ketoacidosis during liberal glucose management of critically ill diabetic patients.Methods: We studied 60 critically ill diabetic patients treated accord- ing to a liberal glucose protocol targeting a blood glucose level (BGL) between 10-14 mmol/l. We performed daily measurement of bedside blood 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate ( -OHB) and semi-quantitative urine ketones on ICU admission and on the following mornings dur-ing the ICU stay, for a maximum of 10 consecutive days. Results: Median (IQR) blood ketone level on admission was 0.3 (0.1, 0.8) mmol/l. Ketoacidosis was rare (3 %), but some level of ketosis ( - OHB0.6 mmol/l) was found in 38 patients (63 %) at some stage during their ICU stay. However, there was no significant difference in severity or prevalence of ketonemia and ketonuria among patients with BGL above (permissive hyperglycemia) or below 10 mmol/l. Onmultivariate linear regression there was no association betweenblood ketone levels and BGL, HbA1c, lactate levels or APACHE III score. Conclusions: Liberal glycemic control in critically ill, predominantly type 2, diabetic patients itself does not appear to lead to increasedketogenesis. We found no difference in prevalence and severity of ketonemia between patients with or without permissive hypergly- cemia. Furthermore, severity of ketosis was unrelated to blood glu-cose levels.

A516 Evaluation of different glucose variability indices with H\u00f4pital Erasme, Intensive Care, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A516 Introduction: Reducing glucose variability (GV) is one of the aims of blood glucose (BG) control as it is an independent predictor of ICU and hospital mortality. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) mighthelp to decrease GV by providing frequent measurements of glucoseand information about glucose trend. However, the metrics of GV might differ according to the frequency of measurement. Objectives: To evaluate the correlation between GV indices derived from intermittent glucose values and from CGM.Methods: A correlation between GV indices derived from intermit- tent readings (blood gas analyser [BGA]) and those derived from CGM was searched from data recorded in the same patients over thesame period of time.Data from patients recruited for the MANAGE (Manual vs. Automated Monitoring Accuracy of Glucose) II trial between July 2012 and April 2014 were analysed. Inclusion criteria were age >18 years, expectedICU length of stay of 3 days, an Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II 10, hyperglycemia >150 mg/dl at the time of admission and need for a central venous catheter, one lumen of which was connected to Optiscanner\u00ae (Optiscan, Hayward, CA), avalidated mid-infrared spectroscopy method variability glucose (in mg/dl) measured intermittently byBGA and by CGM over the same period. Pearson\u00b4s correlation coeffi- cient between intermittent and CGM values was calculated for each metric. A Bland-Altman plot with bias (mean difference between thedevice and BGA measurements) and limits of agreement (bias \u00b1 1.96x standard deviation of the bias) was used to analyse the agreement between the device and the BGA results. Results: Data from 88 patients were analysed. For each index, there was a significant correlation (p < 0.0001) between values calculatedfrom intermittent readings and CGM. However, correlations were higher for J-index (0.96), SD GLI (0.82) and MAGE (0.77). The mean difference and limits of agree-ment (lower limit, upper limit) observed in Bland-Altman plot were0.01 ( 0.10, Conclusions: The most reliable GV indices (highest correlation and lowest bias) are GVI and SD. These are the least influenced by the timing of measurement. A517 Effects of near-continuous glucose monitoring as a guide Universit\u00e9 Libre de Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A517 Introduction: Each of the three domains i.e. hyper- glycemia, hypoglycemia and high glycemic variability is associated with poor outcome. The glycemic control with insulin to maintain blood glucose (BG) within a narrow range as currently recommendedinvolves repeated checks of BG. Near-continuous intravascular moni-toring (CGM) can represent a useful tool to facilitate and to improve glycemic control. Objectives: To assess the effects of the use of CGM on the quality and safety of glycemic control.Methods: Adult critically ill patients expected to stay at least 3 days in the department of intensive care of the Erasme University Hospital in Brussels, Belgium and presenting an hyperglycemia (BG > 150 mg/dl) up to 6 hours after admission and / or ongoing insulin therapywith a patent access to a large peripheral vein were equipped with a catheter connected to a enzymatic CGM sensor (GlucoClear\u00ae, Ed- wards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA). Two of the 4 units of the departmentwere randomized to adjust insulin infusion rate to keep BG between90 and 150 mg/dl (dynamic scale) using the values displayed on the monitor (unblinded group, U). In the 2 other units (blind group (B)), no value was displayed on the screen. The quality of glycemic con-trol assessed by the proportion of time in range (TIR) and the safetyIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 269 of 607assessed by the percentage of time spent below 70 mg/dl (TB70) were calculated from the values recorded by the CGM for each day and for the whole study period and compared between the twogroups by ANOVA.Results: Seventy-seven eligible patients (age 61 \u00b1 8 years, 56 males, medical admission 74 %, APACHE II 24 \u00b1 5, ICU mortality 23 %) con- sented to participate and were included in the U group (n = 39) or the Bgroup (n = 38). 43107 BG values (22721 in the U group and 20386 in theB group) were recorded during 1 da y (n = 77), 2 days (n = 64) or 3 days (n = 40). TIR did not differ between groups (70 \u00b1 27 (U) vs 73 \u00b1 23 % (B)), nor for any of the days of recording. However, the TB70 was lower inthe U group than in the B group (0.4 \u00b1 0.9 vs 1.6 \u00b1 3.4 %, p < .05).Conclusions: The use of a CGM-based strategy improved the safety of glycemic control in a mixed population of ICU patients with stress hyperglycemia.

Iwasaka - Oita Almeida Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Oita, Japan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A518 Introduction: It is well known that poor preoperative blood glucose control is associated with poor postoperative blood glucose control and postoperative complications. Postoperative hyperglycemia iscommon in patients underwent cardiac surgery, in thosewith a preoperative elevated HbA1c. The STG-55 (Nikkiso CO., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) is a newly developed and commercialized computer regulated continuous blood glucose management apparatus.Objectives: To compare the usefulness and the workload of ICU nurses of the STG-55 with the conventional sliding scale method in diabetic patients underwent cardiac surgery. Methods: The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board, and written, informed consent was obtained from all participants.This study included 28 patients underwent elective cardiac surgery with preoperative HbA1c > 6.0 %. The management of blood glucose was performed from immediately after admission to the ICU for tworesearch days. The patients were randomly assigned to control bloodglucose levels with the STG-55 group (n = 16) or sliding scale method, SS group (n = 12). The usefulness of blood glucose manage- ment defined the incidence of hyperglycemia (blood glucose >180 mg/dL), hypoglycemia (<80 mg/dL), and the maximum glycemicvariability (maximum blood glucose level minus minimum blood glu- cose level). The workload of ICU nurses defined the number of blood samplings for the management of blood glucose and the number ofcalls made to the physician.Results: The two groups were comparable with respect to age, gen- der, height, weight, duration of surgery, the amount of blood loss during surgery and the preoperative HbA1c. The blood glucose levelsdetermined STG-55 and ABL3 laboratory analyzer were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.936), with nearly identical values. The inci- dence of hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia was significantly lower in the STG-55 group (1.9 \u00b1 1.3 vs 6.7 \u00b1 4.9 times/day, < 0.001; \u00b1 0.1vs 5.8 \u00b1 6.0 times/day, p < 0.001) than SS group. The maximum gly-cemic variability was also significantly lower in the STG-55 group (46 \u00b1 32 vs 283 \u00b1 165 mg/dL, p < 0.01). The frequency of blood samplings (4.2 \u00b1 3.7 vs 21.5 \u00b1 14.1 times/day, p < 0.01), and the number of callsmade to physician (2.1 \u00b1 2.2 vs 6.9 \u00b1 5.4 times/day, p < 0.05) were sig-nificantly lower in the STG-55 group than SS group.Conclusions: Use of the STG-55 in the ICU contributed to improved blood glucose management and reduced workload of ICU nurses compared to using the sliding scale method.

A519 A physicochemical approach to acid -base balance in critically ill patients after infusion of seven different types of balanced fluids A. Rugerio Cabrera, E. Monares Zepeda, Medical Critical Care Department 'Dr. Mario Shapiro', Mexico City, MexicoCorrespondence: A. Rugerio Cabrera - The Americam British Cowdray Medical Center, Critical Care Department 'Dr. Mario Shapiro', Mexico City, Mexico Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A519 Introduction: Acid -base status in a body fluid is physically determined by several \"independent variables \". These are: PCO 2,t h e \"strong ion dif- ference \"(SID) and all the strong anions (among them is Cl-), and con- centrations of nonvolatile weak acids (Atot). Normal acid -base status is achieved when the independent variables have normal (empirically established) values. The Simplified Fencl-Stewart\u00b4s Method can be used at the bedside of the patient and is more accurate for the assessmentof acid -base balance. Omron, E. developed a physicochemical model of the projected change in standard base excess (SBE) as a conse- quence of infused crystalloid solutions of common use (isotonic saline and balanced fluids); unfortunately this was a clinical simulation atstandard physiological state. In addition, Kaplan, L. evaluated acid -base status after the administration of balanced fluids in trauma patients. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, there are no other clinical trials that evaluate de administration of other types of balanced fluids.Objective: To assess acid -base status of critically ill patients after the infusion of seven different types of balanced solutions Methods: This was a retrospective, observational and descriptive study, conducted in an intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital.We included all patients above 18 years old admitted to this depart-ment from January 2014 to December 2015. We evaluated the effects on acid -base balance after the infusion of seven different solutions: 1) Hartmann + 17.8 mEq/L sodium bicarbonate Hartmann + 25 mEq/L NaHCO3 (SID 53), 5) Hart- mann (SID 28), 6) normal saline 0.45 % + 77 mEq/L NaHCO 3(SID 75), and 7) dextrose solution 5 % 154 mEq/L NaHCO3 (SID 154). Arterialblood gases, serum electrolytes, and proteins were measured in thesame blood sample. Also SIDa, SEDe, SIG, ATOT, pCO 2, change in standard base excess pH, [HCO 3], [Na]p and SOFA were calcu- SBE and PCO 2were estimated with the ABL8000 FLEX blood gas analyzer. Data are mean \u00b1 SD or percents. We used dataanalysis package SSPS. Results: Ninety-nine patients were included. Of these, 54 % were women and 45 % men. The most used solutions were Hartmann(25 %), Hartmann + 8.9 mEq/L NaHCO 3(21 %), and Hartmann + 25 mEq/l NaHCO3 (18 %). Before the infusion, SIDe was under 30 mEq/L in 30 % of patients and above in 23 % of them. The effect on the SIDe was significant before the infusion of different solutions(p 0.01), SIDe > 30 \u00b1 8 mEq/L. No metabolic alkalosis or greater de-crease was observed.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 270 of 607Conclusions: This study assesses additional varieties of fluids that have a different SID in the clinical setting.

Drolz - Medical University Center Hamburg- Eppendorf, Intensive Care Medicine, Hamburg, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A520 Introduction: Severe acid -base balance abnormalities are frequently observed in critically ill patients at the intensive care unit (ICU) and can be present in different patterns. Acid -base profiles of critically ill cirrhotic patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF) have not been investigated. Objectives: To assess disturbances of acid -base status in critically ill patients with ACLF in comparison to patients without. Methods: Preliminary analysis of patients admitted to medical ICU at the Medical University of Vienna. Presence of cirrhosis and ACLF, re- spectively, was assessed, and blood for laboratory- and blood gas analysis was drawn from an arterial line. Reference values were ob- tained from blood samples of healthy volunteers (n = 14). Mortality was assessed on site. Results: A total of 615 patients were studied, 142 of these patients had underlying liver cirrhosis. One hundred twenty-eight patients ful- filled criteria of ACLF. Median SOFA score of the total cohort was 10 (IQR 6 -13), median SAPS II score 53 (IQR 38 -70) and median age 60 (IQR 49 -69) years. Patients with liver cirrhosis showed a marked metabolic acidosis compared to critically ill patients without (Base excess (BE) -6.8 (IQR 12.3 to 0.8) mmol/l vs. -1.5 2.7) mmol/l, p < 0.001). Ana- lysis of the BE subcomponents revealed that this acidosis was primar- ily attributable to hyperchloremia (BE Cl=4.6 mmol/ by hypoalbuminemic alkalosis was found in critically ill patients with and without liver disease. In pa- tients with cirrhosis, we observed respiratory alkalosis (partial pres- sure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) = 36.4 (IQR 28.5 - 44.5) mmHg) counteracting metabolic acidosis. With progression to ACLF, the compensatory mechanisms (hyperven- tilation and hypoalbuminemia) became insufficient resulting in pro- gression of metabolic acidosis. Accordingly, BE in patients with ACLF grade 3 was 10.1 (IQR 17.4 to 3.6) mmol/l with a resulting pH of 7.29 (IQR 7.14 to 7.41). Lactate (BE Lactate =3.6 UMA=3.9 (IQR 8.9 to were main contributors to metabolic acidosis in ACLF grade 3. The extent of metabolic derangement attributable to lactate and unmeasured anions, 28-day-mortality (Fig. 44). Conclusions: is a common feature of cirrhosis and ACLF at the ICU and is more severe compared to patients without cirrhosis. Acidosis in ACLF is primarily attributable to lactate anions. Although hyperchloremic acidosis did contributeto metabolic acidosis in critically ill patients, we found no clinically relevant difference in chloride-related acidosis between patients with and without liver disease.

Sabetian - Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Trauma Research Center, Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A521 Introduction: Liver transplantation is the treatment of choice in end stage liver disease, but significant mortality rate and organ shortage has resulted in multiple attempts to chose good donors and appropri- ate recipients. (1) The Stewart\u00b4s approach is a new concept in critical ill patients and can identify occult acid -base disturbances. (2,) Although study on Stewart\u00b4s approach were increased in recent years but its diagnostic and prognostic advantages remain contraversial. (3) Objectives: Our primary objective was correlation between SIG (strong ion difference) in donor and graft function. Secondary object- ive was comparison between SIG and marginal graft criteria as a pre- dictor for liver transplantation outcome. Methods: In 51 donors, marginal graft criteria were determined. SIG in all cases were calculated and we followed mortality and complica- tions in recepiants at 72 hr,1 week, 1 month after transplantation. Results: 54.9 % of livers were marginal. Mean MELD Score in recipi- ents was 21.25 \u00b1 5.95 . According to calculated SIG value, recipients were divided into SIG > 10 and SIG < 10. This study showed that no Fig. 44 (abstract A520).

Ethics of end-of-life-care A522 End of life care in haematology patients: a job for critical care outreach services? L. Taheri, R. Anandanadesan, V. Metaxa 1King's College Hospital (Denmark Hill), Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK Correspondence: L. Taheri - King's College Hospital (Denmark Hill), Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A522 Introduction: Despite recent medical advances and improved sur- vival, patients with haematological malignancies (HM) still have a high mortality, and end-of-life (EoL) care has become an integral part of their treatment.1Evidence suggests less palliative care involve- ment and limited advanced care planning in patients with HM, prob- ably because of the unclear transition between curative and palliative phases of their disease.1,2Critical Care Outreach Services (CCOS) have been shown to participate in more than 50 % of EoL planning as part of their everyday workload.3 Objectives: To evaluate the role and input of CCOS in EoL care of pa- tients with HM. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients with HM from January 2014 to October 2015 who were referred to CCOS in a London specialist hospital. Variables analysed included age, diagnosis, ICU admission, time spent by CCOS, interventions pro- vided and in-hospital mortality. Results: There were 145 patients who were reviewed on 257 differ- ent occasions. Their age ranged from 18 to 84 years (median 56) and their diagnoses are shown in Fig. 45. Of those, 16/145 (11 %) patients were identified as palliative; 81 % of them received EoL care on the ward. National Early Warning Scores at referral ranged from 2 to 10 (median 7). A total of 723 days was spent by CCOS in reviewing patients with HM, with 146 days (20 % of their clinical time) spent on palliative patients alone (median time 5.5d vs. 3d for non-palliative patients). Overall, in-hospital mortality among these patients was 81 %. The services provided by CCOS to palliative patients were mainly fa- cilitation of symptom control (67 %) and/or support of ward teams in making treatment limitation decisions (78 %). High Flow Nasal Can- nula Oxygen (HFNC) was initiated in 38 % of patients for symptom control, which was deemed successful in all but 2 patients. Conclusions: A considerable part of the CCOS workload is spent on supporting the management of palliative haematology patients. In- volvement in alleviating symptoms and initiating EoL discussions fea- tures strongly in the interventions requested by the ward teams. The significant use of HFNC therapy for symptom control that was ob- served in this population also warrants further investigation.References 1. Howell DA et al.

However, while palliative care aims to reduce suffering, intensive care has a major focus on saving lives. Objectives: To identify and compare the experiences of ICU and PCU healthcare professionals related to: contact with dying and death, mak- ing of ethical decisions and communication and delivery of bad news. Methods: Mixed approach, combining quantitative (questionnaire on experiences in the work context) and qualitative ones (interviews with doctors and nurses). 10 ICU and 9 PCU participated in this study. 392 professionals completed the survey; 28 were interviewed. A descriptive quantitative analysis was performed; the chi-square test was used to analyse the association between variables (significance level of p < .05). Interviews were subject to content analysis. Results: In the week prior to survey completion, more professionals working in ICUs reported a patient's death; this was not statistically significant. The experience most mentioned by the professionals of both types of units during interviews was caring for patients nearing death. In the week before completing the questionnaire, the most common ethical decision was palliative/terminal sedation; this was more, often in ICUs (27 % vs. 12 %; p = .004). In the day of question- naire completion, the most frequent ethical decision was also pallia- tive sedation. Though this decision was more frequent in ICU, Fig. 45 (abstract A522).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 272 of 607statistical significance was not reached (p = .440). The communication of the diagnosis/prognosis to the patient, either in the week before or in the day of questionnaire completion was more frequent inPCUs (45 % vs. 29 %, p = .005; 22 % vs. 12 %, p = .026, respectively).Communication about the diagnosis/prognosis with the family in the week before survey completion was held with equal frequency by professionals from both contexts (58 % of professionals). Althoughnot reaching statistical significance (p = .303), more professionalsfrom PCU proceeded to communication with family about the diagnosis and prognosis (32 % vs. 26 %) in the survey day. From the analysis of the interviews, it was denoted that it were mainly profes-sionals of PCU who referred to the communication on the diagnosis/prognosis, both with the patient as with the family. Conclusions: The workplace experiences in ICU and PCU are, despite some differences, guided by similarities. Caring for patients with life-threatening situations and imminent death and the need to makeethical decisions occur frequently in both contexts. The communica- tion about the diagnosis/prognosis occurs more often in PCU. This highlights the need for integrating communication strategies of pal-liative care, in intensive care. References 1.

Beckmann - Jena University Hospital, Anaesthesiologyy and Intensive Care, Jena, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A524 Introduction: Complex elective surgery is increasingly provided to an aging population with heightened risk for prolonged ICU stay or death.While risks of surgical and anaesthetic procedures are routinely dis- cussed preoperatively in the process of obtaining informed consent, the patients' preferences in case of unfavourable ICU outcomes arerarely discussed and most critically ill patients do not have advance di-rectives. If patients at risk of a prolonged ICU stay or death could be identified preoperatively, this would provide an opportunity to make their preferences known in a timely and adequate manner.Objectives: To identify the predictive validity of routine pre-operative risk assessment for an unfavourable ICU course (ICU stay > 24 hours or death), and to assess the prevalence of advance directives in these patients. Methods: Among all 13437 elective adult surgical cases seen in ter- tiary university hospital\u00b4s pre-operative anaesthesiology clinic in2014, 1832 consecutive cases were drawn. Data were extracted from hospital and ICU databases, including patient demographics, pre- operative American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification,length of ICU stay, mortality and presence of advance directives. Areceiver operating characteristic analysis was conducted to test the predictive validity of ASA for a) having an ICU stay > 24 h and b) dying in the ICU or afterwards. Optimal cut-offs were identified bymaximum Youden's J statistic.Results: Among 1832 patients, 937 (51 %) were male, median age was 63 years (interquartile range 49 -74), planned procedures were mainly from General, Trauma, Cardiothoracic, Eye, Gynecological,Urological or ENT Surgery. Pre-operatively, patients were classifiedinto ASA risk classes (15 %, 41 %, 40 % and 4 % into ASA 1 -4, re- spectively). Postoperatively, 504 (28 %) patients were admitted to the ICU. Of these, 373 (74 %) had an ICU LOS > 24 hours and 68 (13 %)died in the ICU or afterwards. Among patients with an ICU stay >24 hours, presence of an AD was documented in 49 (15 %) and power of attorney for a legal proxy in 71 (22 %). Pre-operative ASA classification predicted an ICU stay >24 h with an area under thecurve (AUC) of 0.79, and death in the ICU or afterwards with an AUCof 0.85. The optimal cut-off for both adverse outcomes was ASA 3. For ICU stay >24 h sensitivity was 0.85, specificity was 0.67; for death in or after ICU sensitivity was 0.93 and specificity was 0.58.Conclusions: Preoperative ASA classification with a cut-off of 3 has a good predictive validity to identify the risk of prolonged ICU stay or death in patients undergoing elective surgery. Such risk stratifica- tion could be useful to initiate advance decision-making at the timeof the pre-operative work-up of these patients and thus increase theprevalence of adequate ADs in the ICU.

Robertsen - Oslo University Hospital, Anesthesiology and critical care, Oslo, Norway Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A525 Introduction: Studies have shown variations in practice across hospitals regarding treatment-limitations and mortality for brain-injured patients.Objectives: To study treatment-limitations and associated mortality in a Norwegian trauma hospital and documentation of ethical as- pects such as presence of advanced directives, dialogue with fam-ilies, multi-team discussions, reasons and considerations behinddecisions ,conflicts and involvement of clinical ethics committees. Methods: A retrospective study of a 2-year cohort of severe head in- jured patients admitted 2011 -12 to Oslo university hospital, Norway. Trauma registry data were combined with data from medical records.For data validation a definition guide for study variables was developed. Adults with abbreviated injury sco re head 4,5,6 were included (n = 579). Results: Eighty-five % of all patients were admitted to ICU. Treatment limitations were identified in 17 % of cases (101 patients). Decisionswere: Withholding organ support (12 cases), withholding surgery (52 cases), withdrawing intracranial pressure-targeted therapy (23 cases), DNR-orders (44 cases), no-escalation of treatment (19 cases) or with-drawing organ support (44 cases). For some patients initial decisionswere changed (19 cases) or revoked (3 cases) along the dynamic treatment trajectory. Twenty-six patients with devastating brain in- jury progressed to brain death. No patients had advanced directives.Dialogue with family was documented in most cases (98). No majorconflict between families and treatment team was identified and there was no involvement by CEC. Rationale behind decisions was identified as medical only in 80 % of cases. Treatment-limitations followed situa-tions categorized as futile (59 cases) or \"potentially inappropriate treat- ment \"(42 cases) (1). The overall 30-day mortality was 16 % (35 % for patient with GCS < 9 and 7,5 % for patients with GCS >8). Treatment- limitations were identified in 93 % of cases of in-hospital death. In-hospital mortality was 73 %, 30-day mortality 82 % and 2-year mortality93 % in the treatment-limiting group (n = 101 patients, 25 patients were transferred to other facilities with limitations). In-hospital mortality was 1 %, 30-day mortality 2 % and 2-year mortality 8 % for patientswithout limitations made at the trauma hospital (n = 478).Conclusions: Treatment limitations are common in patients with traumatic brain injury and were closely associated with in-hospital death. Withholding or withdrawing life-sustaining therapy in thisearly phase of hospitalization was primarily based on the medicalsituation and at the discretion of the physician. Whether patients' values and preferences were adequately addressed or had an impact on decisions (when appropriate) remains unclear. References 1. Rubin, M. A. and J.

Participants were asked to record their opin-ion regarding consent and acceptable outcome based on the Modified Rankin Score (mRS). They were then given a detailed ana- lysis of the evidence for clinical efficacy of the procedure and an ex-planation of the \"disability paradox \". They were then asked to reconsider their initial responses. Results: Of the 773 participants included in the study 407 (52.7 %) initially felt that they would provide consent for a decompressive cra-niectomy as a life-saving procedure but only a minority of them con-sidered mRS 4 or 5 as an acceptable outcome (for mRS 4: n = 67, 8.7 %; for mRS = 4: n = 57, 7.4 %). After introducing the concept of the disability paradox and the evidence for the clinical efficacy of de-compressive craniectomy, more participants were unwilling to acceptdecompressive craniectomy (18.1 % vs. 37.8 %) but, at the same time, more were willing to accept mRS 4 as an acceptable outcome (for mRS 4: n = 92, 11.9 %; for mRS = 4: n = 79, 10.2 %). Conclusion: Most participants felt that survival with dependency to be unacceptable. However, many would appear to be willing to provide consent for surgery in the hope that they may sur- vive with some degree of independence.

Nieto Gonzalez - Virgen de la Victoria Hospital, Intensive Care, M\u00e1laga, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A527 Objective: To analyze why patients who are assessed by an intensivist physician for some reasons are not admitted to ICU. Also we want tofind out what happened to this patients after intensivist evaluation.Design: Observational and prospective study during 12 consecutive months. Scope: Second level Hospital with 550 beds and 18 ICU boxes.Method: We searched daily for patients who were assessed but not ad- mitted to ICU during 12 consecutive months. We write down medical record number, which of the hospital departments asked for that ICU evaluation and the reason why the patient was not finally admitted toICU (low severity, life-sustaining treatment limitation or not ICU bedavailability). We follow up those patients until hospital discharged, find- ing either decease, hospital discharge or later ICU admission. Results: 1297 patients were assessed but not admitted to ICU. The reasons for not admission were low severity in 736 patients(56.8 %), life-sustaining treatment limitation in 459 patients (35.5 %) and no ICU bed availability in 102 situations (7.9 %). Main hospital departments that asked for assessment withoutconsequent ICU admission were Emergency (N = 899, 69 %), In-ternal Medicine (N = 140, 10.8 %) and General Surgery (N = 62, 4.8 %). Life-sustaining treatment limitation decision was mostly taken in Emergency Department (N = 253) and Internal Medicine(N = 83), 166 cases survived and were discharged from hospital(36 %). 736 patients were dismissed because of low severity, but91 were finally admitted to ICU later (12.3 %) and 125 patients died (16.9 %). 102 patients were not admitted because of no ICU bed availability, majority were treated in Observation Room inEmergency Department (N = 94, 92.2 %); 29 of them were admit-t e dt oI C Ul a t e r( 2 8 . 4% )a n d2 0d i e d( 1 9 . 6% ) . Conclusions: From these results we conclude that maybe the lack of beds in ICU can generate a belated admission to ICU andhigher mortality rate in recoverable patients. One third of pa-tients with a life-sustaining treatment limitation decision finally survive the hospitalization. Also we conclude that a considerable amount of intensivist clinical assistance during the shifts takesplace outside de ICU.

Rusinova - General University Hospital, 1st Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague, Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A528 Introduction: Addressing the quality of end of life care has become an important focus of research and patient management in the ICU.Although quality of care and support for patients who die in the ICUand their families are well described, a little is known about the deci- sion making process and the quality of care provided for patients dying outside the ICU.Objectives: To characterize the care for patients dying during the last hospitalization in terms of circumstances of death, provided palliative care, medical decision making, nurses perceptions and family experience. Methods: A prospective observational cohort study in two ter- tiary university centers in Prague, Czech Republic. Data from thepatient documentation and semi-structured questionnaire with the attending physician and the nurse present at the moment of death were collected. A semi-structured phone interview withthe family member was held 3 -6 months after the death. The study has received an IRB approval. Results: Among 44236 patients hospitalized between February 2015 and February 2016, 1097 has died, of them 926 patients (86,4 %) were en-rolled in the study (42.1 % in the ICU and 57.9 % at wards). The basic pa-tients\u00b4 characteristic is presented in the Table 20. The majority of deaths in the hospitals were expected and hence not preceded by a cardiopul- monary resuscitation. The mention of a poor prognosis was documented in a majority of cases, the DNR and DNI being the most frequent type oftreatment limitation both in ICU and wards. The treatment limitation was communicated with the family fare more often than to the patient (81 % and 31 %, respectively). Patients did not have an advance directivesdocument, nor were their treatment preferences documented during thelast hospitalization (0,5 and 1,62 %, respectively). The various aspects of treatment limitations in the ICU vs. wards are presented in Table 21. Conclusions: This is the first large prospective study comparing the de- cision making process and the perceptions of clinicians and familymembers of patients dying in a tertiary care hospital. The study shows an insufficient interdisciplinary and intra-team communication with dis- crepancies between the documented and the agreed treatment limita-tions. Furthermore, a difficult communication with patients and theirfamilies in final phases of patients\u00b4 lives suggests a gap between the care provided and the patients preferences regarding the end-of-life, although these are known to be key aspects of good end-of-life care.

A comparison between controlledcardiac death donors Puerta de Hierro Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A529Objective: To compare the different strategies of analgesia and sed- ation applied in control cardiac death donors (DCD) versus non- donors after limitation of life sustaining treatment (LLST) thru ter-minal extubation (TE).Methods: Retrospective study (January 2012 - March 2016) in a Spanish tertiary hospital. We stud ied all patients that underwent LLST thru TE. Demographic factors, general patient characteristics(comorbidities, diagnosis upon ICU admission, APACHE II on ad-mission and SOFA in the previous 24 h before TE), ICU length of stay and timing from TE to cardiac arrest together with their donor/non-donor condition were recorded. We also analyzed thedifferent types and doses of analgesic and sedation drugs (mor-phine, fentanyl, remifentanyl, propofol and midazolam) and the different strategies used (bolus administration, increase of the in- fusion rate or both). In order to simplify dosage analysis we usedthe intervals previously described by other authors 1.S t a t i s t i c a l analysis with c2and Mann -Whitney Utest. Statistical significance p < 0,05. Results: During the period studied we recovered a total of 68 patients with LLST thru TE that were divided in two groups:DCD (group A, n = 26) and non-donors (group B, n = 42). Demographic data and general cha racteristic are described in Table 22. There were no statistical differences regarding the different typesand doses of analgesia and sedation, and the different strategies used in group A vs group B (Table 23and Fig. 46). Although none of the following reached statistical significance we found that the num-ber of patients receiving doses described as superior to standardaccounted for an important percentage in both groups, and that there was a higher rate of bolus administration followed by an in- crease in infusion rate un group B (53,3 %) when compared to groupA (29,4 %).Conclusion: In our study we found no differences in dose, type and strategy applied for analgesia and sedation after TE regardless of whether the patient was a potential organ donor or not.

Indicator 97: Information to patients and their relatives in ICU. Indicator 98: ad- vance directives in decision makings. Indicator 99: Informed written consent forms corrected filled out . Indicator 100: Limitation life sup- port. Indicator 101: Restraints applications. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 15 for Windows. Results: 68 ICU participate. 50 belongs to public health services and 14 with other financial management. 70,6 % were university hospi- tals. Indicator 96: 44 % have end of life protocol available. Consensus decisions with participation of nurses in 79,6 %. Indicator 97: Daily in- formation in 97 %, 82 % have specific room for information, in 92 %information is given by the doctor and in 61 % information is written in the medical record. Indicator 98: Advance directives 53 %. Indica- tor 99: percentage of informed written consent forms correctly filled out was variable according type of procedure. Indicator 100: 48 % have a limitation life support written form. Indicator 101: 40 % have a restraint application protocol. Conclusions: Best compliance was observed in the indicator related with the information in ICU. We must to improve variability observed about written inform consents and to promote advance directives in clinical decision making. Bioethics quality of care in ICU take on great importance.

However, the success of care should not only be measured by sur- vival, but should include the quality of life of each patient who sur- vives and the comfort of the terminally ill. Objectives: To evaluate the comprehension of nurses and physicians concerning end-of-life decisions. Methods: The study consisted of a cross-sectional survey with a self-completed questionnaire applied to nurses and physicians on a voluntary and anonymous basis. The questionnaire was con- structed around the meaning of end-of-life decisions: withdrawal and withhold life-sustaining treatments and do not resuscitate decisions. Results: A total of 174 questionnaires were delivered and 109 were returned (response rate of 63 %). However, two of the questionnaires were excluded by multiple responses to each question. Seventy-one percent were nurses, 29 % were physicians and 59 % were female; the median age was 35 years-old and the median years of practicing was 11; 64 % had religious beliefs (53 % of the physicians and 68 % of the nurses). The comprehension of end-of-life decisions was noted in 86 % of the physicians and nurses: 93 % comprehended the meaning of withdrawal and withhold life-sustaining treatments and 97 % comprehended the meaning of do not resuscitate decision. There were no significant statistical differences in the comprehension of end-of-life decisions between physicians and nurses. The religious belief was a factor significantly associated with poor comprehension of end-of-life decisions ( p0,044), namely withhold life-sustaining treatment. Conclusions: In this study, we found that not all physicians and nurses of an emergency and intensive care department compre- hend the meaning of end-of-life decisions. Religious belief was significantly associated with poor comprehension of en-of-life de- cisions, namely withhold life-sustaining treatment. This study draws our attention to the need to improve training and educa- tion about end-of-life decisions in the emergency and intensive care units and to conduct further studies to evaluate the compre- hension of the nurses and physicians on other departments of the hospital.Table 23 (abstract A529).

Pande - BLK Superspeciality Hospital, Critical Care Medicine, New Delhi, India Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A532 Introduction: Withholding or withdrawal has been reported in 19- 50 % of deaths in Indian ICUs, withdrawal being limited to only 8 %of cases1. Various reasons have been identified as barriers to end of life care in India2. A recent physician interview based Asian multi- national study has highlighted significant difference in such practices3. Objectives: This study was undertaken to look at the attitude of In- dian families towards end of life care (EOL) issues. Methods: A standard protocol for family discussion was developed. Relevant end of life care issues was discussed in presence of admit-ting physician, ICU nurse, medical administrator and members of ICUteam. The filled up EOL family discussions forms related to 44 critic- ally ill adult patients admitted to ICU between March 2010 & March 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. The discussions held during non-regular hours were excluded.Results: The data included 26 male and 18 female patients, admitted with a medical diagnosis (n = 18), surgical (n = 4), trauma (n = 6) or cancer (n = 16). The age of patients varied from 20 -40 years (22.7 %, n = 10), 40 -60 yrs. (18 %, n = 8), 60 -80 yrs. (36.36 %, n = 16) and 10 patients (22.7 %) were >80 years of age. In majority of the discus- sions more than 3 members of the family participated (n = 29), 2 members (n = 12) and 1member in 3 patients.All families participated in end of life care discussions. They under-stood and agreed on a situation of medical futility and irreversibility in their loved ones and 79.54 % (n = 35) families requested for no further escalation in treatment. 43 % (n = 19) families agreed for NoCPR orders, whereas 20.45 % (n = 9) agreed for Do not intubate anddo not ventilate orders. Only 4.54 % (n = 2) families agreed for with- drawal of ventilator, 9 % agrees for withdrawal of vasopressors and only 1 family (2.27 %) agreed for organ donation. Majority of thefamilies (90.9 %, n = 40) tried to understand the measures given toalleviate pain and the feeling of dyspnoea related to ventilator with- holding or withdrawal. Conclusions: Our study shows willingness of families to participate in end of life care discussions and accepting medical futility and irrever-sibility of such situations. Withholding life care was more acceptable than withdrawing. References 1. Kapadia F, Singh M, Divatia J et al.

Ter Braak2,3 1University Medical Center Utrecht, IC Center, Utrecht, Netherlands; 2University Medical Center Utrecht, Educational Center, Utrecht, Netherlands;3University Medical Center Utrecht, Internal Medicine, Utrecht, Netherlands Correspondence: M.J. Van Dam - University Medical Center Utrecht, Educational Center, Utrecht, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A533 Introduction: Advance care planning (ACP) is the process in which the patient makes decisions in consultation with health care givers aboutfuture health care once they become incapable of deliberate medicaltreatment decisions. ACP is increasingly recognized as area of concern respecting quality of care in the ICU and other wards in the hospital. However, research shows that ACP discussions (ACPd) are still rare inhospital settings: clinicians underestimate the number of patients will-ing to discuss ACP and the feeling being unskilled, inadequately trained or inexperienced may hamper a meaningful patient-doctor discussion. Objectives: To develop and evaluate an e-module preparing resi- dents to perform effective and timely ACPd.Methods: Development of an e-module aiming to equip residents with knowledge, skills and appropriate attitudes for ACPd, preferably in a simulated situation before real life practice in the workplace. Thedesign of this e-module is inspired by the 4C/ID-model. First, expertsexplain the ethical, legal and social issues concerning ACP that con- stitute the learning goals of the e-module. Subsequently, five cases are presented in videos illustrating appropriate performance. Eachcase is provided with comments from experts and residents and theiradvice based on personal experience. Cases are presented in increas- ing complexity sequence. Roles of patients are performed by trained simulation patients. Residents, senior staff and nurses demonstratelifelike ACPd designed to illustrate preset educational goals.Documenting ACP agreements in the electronic health record is shown using screen shots. Finally, background information by experts and use- ful links are offered. Learners work through the e-module at their ownpace with the option to interrupt and looking back. The e-module waspiloted in a group of residents purposefully sampled from a variety of specialties with a web-based 5 point Likert scale survey with room for narrative explanation to evaluate satisfaction of participants.Results: In this pilot 18 residents participated, mean age 30.4 (+/ SD 2.6) year, 33 % male, in training for neurology (n = 5), internal medicine (n = 5), surgery (n = 3), anesthesiology (n = 2), cardiology (n = 1) and undisclosed (n = 2), ranging from 1 stto 6thyear of training (median 3rd). 83 % of participants (strongly) agreed with the state- ment that the e-module is well-arranged. 89 % (n = 16) review the e- module as giving sufficient insight in the necessity of ACPd. Ten resi- dents (55 %) appraise the e-module offering guidance for performingACPd themselves in clinical practice. Overall satisfaction was 7/10points (median, range 6 -8). Conclusions: This pilot suggests s that an e-module showing appropri- ate behaviors based on clarified skills and attitudes by role models inlifelike situations may help to engage residents in learning activitiesand actual practice to master ACPd, thus contributing to quality of care.

Objectives: To describe severity and comorbidity relationship with early mortality in patients admitted in ICU.To analyze differences in patients early died in ICU according limitation of life-sustaining ther- apy (LST) decisions. Methods: Observational study in an ICU of a community hospital. Time of study: 12 months. Inclusion criteria were patients who died within the first 48 hours of ICU admission. The variables analyzed were age, sex, comorbidity Charlson index, APACHE II and lactate levels at ICU admission. Two groups of patients were compared ac- cording LST decisions. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 18 for Windows. Results: 65 consecutive patients were analyzed. In 23 % limitation of life sustaining therapy was decided. Table 24shows the differences between the patients who died with and without LST, lactate levels at ICU admission were 96.1 and 43.2 mg/dl in Not LST group and LST group respectively. There were not observed differences in reason of admission. Conclusions: Predominant clinical profile of patients died early in ICU was elderly patient with high comorbidity, APACHE II and lactate levels at admission. Limitation of life-sustaining therapy decisions were not associated with severity parameters. Comorbidity was higher in this group of patients.

Tharmalingam - North Middlesex University Hospital, Anaesthesia/ITU, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A535 Majority of death occur in critical care unit (CCU) after withdrawal/ withholding of treatment. Our aim was to analyse the documentation of the complex issues surrounding end of life care (EOL) decision in our CCU. We collected data about our CCU practice of EOL decision and compared with the best practice recommended by Royal college of Anaesthetist in 2012. Our goal was to improve the quality of care of the patients with EOL in our CCU. It's a retrospective audit. All the patients in CCU for whom the decision of withdrawal of life prolong- ing treatment from 01/04/2014 -31/03/2015 were included in this study. The data was taken from ACUBASE electronic notes and CCU monitoring charts of the relevant cases and analysed using Microsoft EXCEL. Out of the 217 deaths in CCU 81 (37.3 %) were due to withdrawal of treatment. We had found the excellent documentation regarding family discussion (93.8 %) and formal decision of withdrawal of sup- port (83.9 %). All the patients (100 %) had valid DNACPR form. The documentation of method of withdrawal was 59.2 %, on the other hand the treatment limitation on admission as advanced care plan,documentation of patient discussion about EOL, consideration of spiritual aspect, time of withdrawal, organ donation were docu- mented in 22 %,2 %,12 %,16 % and 30 % of cases respectively. In the method of withdrawal we audited the organ supports and symp- tom relief medications. Only 73 % of the patients had analgesics and 26 % had sedatives during the process of dying. This is because the prescription was done in drug chart. Feeds/fluids were continued in 78 % of patients. As a result of this audit we proposed the following actions To formu- late a template in ACUBASE with essential elements of EOL which will be filled by the relevant CCU consultant and copy of it will be handed over to the bed side nurse for further care. The time of with- drawal will be documented by the bed side nurse after family gath- ering and fulfilment of spiritual aspects in the monitoring chart and the doctor who certifies the death will document it on the ACUBASE.

Rose - University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A536 Introduction: Consistency of definitional criteria for terminology ap- plied to describe various patient cohorts receiving mechanical venti- lation within intensive care unit (ICU) and post-acute care settings is important for understanding prevalence, risk stratification, effective- ness of interventions, and projections for resource allocation. Al- though a 2005 consensus conference defined prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) as mechanical ventilation for 21 consecutive days (1), we hypothesized that variable definitions are used when apply- ing this terminology. Objectives: To quantify use of the term PMV and how it is defined within the literature.Table 24 (abstract A534).

Two authors screened electronic databases(1980 -2013) and abstracted data (country; care venue; diagnostic categories; terms used to describe cohort, definitional criteria for these terms, and rationale; and reported outcomes) independently on a standardized form with accuracy verified by a 3rd author.Results: We screened 5331 references, identified 539 references for full text review and excluded 120. Of the 419 studies meeting inclu- sion criteria, 363 (87 %) were conducted in a single care venue type (most commonly ICU), 30 (7 %) in multiple care venue types, 17(4 %) were database studies, and 9 (2 %) surveys. Studies repre-sented cohorts from 38 countries most commonly the US (187, 44 %). Most studies (297, 71 %) reported data on a heterogeneous patient cohorts, 66 (16 %) studies reported data on surgical patientsonly (46/66, 70 % cardiac surgery). Other studies described chronicobstructive pulmonary disease (16, 4 %), trauma (22, 5 %), neuromus- cular (17, 4 %), and sepsis (1, 0.2 %) cohorts. A total of 741 terms were used to refer to the 419 study cohorts.Most commonly used terms were: PMV (253, 60 %), admission to aspecialized unit (107, 26 %), and long-term mechanical ventilation (79, 19 %). Some authors (282, 67 %) defined their cohorts based on duration of mechanical ventilation with 154 (55 %) using this as thesole criterion. We identified 37 different durations of ventilation ran-ging from 5 hours to 1 year with >21 days being the most common (28/282, 7 %). For studies describing a surgical PMV cohort, minimum ventilation duration required for cohort inclusion was 24 hours for 20/66 (30 %) studies with 15 days as the maximum duration. More than half (237, 57 %) did not provide a reason/rationale for the defin- itional criteria used, with only 28 (7 %) studies referring to a consen- sus definition.Conclusions: Substantial variation exists in the terminology and def- initional criteria for cohorts of patients receiving mechanical ventila- tion. Standardization of terminology and definitional criteria is required for study data to be maximally informative. References 1.

Worrall, M. Arshad, P. IsherwoodUniversity Hospital Birmingham, Critical Care Medicine, Birmingham, UKCorrespondence: S. Denham - University Hospital Birmingham, Critical Care Medicine, Birmingham, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A537 Introduction and objectives: The use of continuous waveform cap- nography is well established within the theatre environment, and is now considered a standard of care within intensive care by UK na-tional bodies123. University Hospital Birmingham is a large UK teaching hospital. His- torically within this unit the use of capnography has not always been routine on all invasively ventilated patients. This quality improvementproject aimed to implement national guidelines in our unit.Methods: To assess the usage, availability and attitudes towards using capnography, a baseline audit of the use of capnography on ventilated patients, during airway interventions and patient transferswas performed.Concurrently a staff questionnaire was circulated to the multidiscip- linary ICU team to complete, in order to assess their knowledge and attitudes towards capnography and promote awareness of nationalguidelines.A business case was developed to purchase sufficient modules and consumables to allow for use on every invasively ventilated patient. Teaching of critical care staff was carried out by the trusts practicedevelopment team in conjunction with volunteers from within thecritical care team. This covered the system set up and interpretation of the capnography waveform. Mandatory use of capnography was then introduced into local guide-lines and its use was then re-audited.Results: The audit results are shown in Table 25. Conclusions: The routine use of capnography for invasively venti- lated patients has risen by 62 %.The use for airway interventions and patient transfers appears tohave remained at the same level or fallen though both these area had much higher baseline rates of use. This highlights an area for further improvement and the wider dis-semination of this work will contribute to further improvement inlocal practice.

Khadjibaev - Uzbekistan Research Center of Emergency Medicine, Tashkent, Uzbekistan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A538 Introduction: Disturbances of external respiratory function (ERF) are in a leading position among extracranial complications after severe traumatic brain injury (STBI). According to the opinion of the most specialists, disturbances of ERF belong to the complications resultedfrom aspiration and damage of mucous tunic of tracheobronchialtree. Aspiration of gastric contents usually occurs owing to con- sciousness depression accompanied by STBI. Objectives: To determine the development periods and to study the development rate of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) inisolated STBI complicated with aspiration of gastric contents and blood. Methods: The study was conducted in neurosurgery intensive care unit at Republic Research Center of Emergency Medicine. 33 of 165patients with STBI admitted between 2013 and 2014 had aspiration. 28 were male and 5 were female. Mean age was 35 \u00b1 3. Glasgow coma score after admission was 5 -9. All patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. Patients were divided into 2 groups accord-ing to the etiology of aspiration agent. First group (n = 33) - patientsTable 25 (abstract A537).

Second group (n = 33) - control group, i.e. with isolated STBI without aspiration. Aspiration was confirmed with fiberoptic bronchoscopy.Results: We conducted analysis of extravascular fluid in the lungs. In 21 patients with aspiration of gastric contents (first group) the amount of extravascular water in lungs (EVWL) 3 -6 hours after the trauma was 7.8 \u00b1 3.0 mL/kg (normal value is 3 -7 mL/kg), was \u00b1 mL/kg,PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 291.8 \u00b1 94.1. Fifteen patients were with ARDS criteria and their EVWL was 9.6 \u00b1 1.6 mL/kg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 218.0 \u00b1 72.9. In 12 patients with aspiration of blood, EVWL 3 -6 hours after the trauma was 9.3 \u00b1 2.9 mL/kg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 336.2 \u00b120.7. Nine of them had ARDS criteria and their EVWL was 10.2 \u00b1 2.2 mL/kg, after 24 hours it was 10.5 \u00b1 4.9 mL/kg. In the second group after 3 -6 hours, EVWL was 6.8 \u00b1 1.5 mL/kg, PaO2/FiO2 ratio was 330.5 \u00b1 183.2 and of the patients had ARDS After24 hours EVWL was ratio 323.9 122.4, and of had ARDS criteria, EVWL was 9.6 \u00b1 1.4 mL/ kg, PaO2/FiO2 was 234.0 \u00b1 17.2.Conclusions: Hence in patients with STBI and aspiration of gastric contents we observed significant increase in EVWL (p = 0.05) and de- crease in PaO2/FiO2 ratio in the first hours after trauma in compari- son with the patients without aspiration. Accumulation of EVWL canbe considered as one of ARDS criteria, but only with other signs ofdamage. ARDS is registered in the first hours after trauma roughly in 50 % of cases in patients with aspiration of both gastric contents and blood. A539 Non-invasive ventilation as an alternative treatment of acuterespiratory failure in the critical care unit G.A. Galvez Olvera Guzman, J.S. Aguirre S\u00e1nchez, J. Intensive Care Unit, Mexico City, MexicoCorrespondence: G.A. Galvez Blanco - BC Medical Center, Intensive Care Unit, Mexico City, Mexico Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A539 Introduction: Acute respiratory failure (ARF) can be divided in hypox- emic or hypercapnic, depending on the leading modification in blood gas analysis, being the first one the most common. MechanicalVentilatory Support is one of the treatment mainstays of patients inthe Intensive Care Units (ICU), either as management for a primary respiratory imbalance or to protect the airway. Non-invasive mechan- ical ventilation (NIMV) is defined as any method in which positivepressure is delivered by a face mask or any other interphase withoutthe use of an endotracheal tube. Objetives: It is well established in which pathologies NIMV can be useful, but an inadequate patient selection may cause an incrementin morbidity and mortality as well as a delay in endotracheal intub-ation. While the aim in most studies is to determine which patholo- gies NIMV will have a better outcome, the main objective in our study was to define whether the blood gas values (pH, paCO 2and paO 2) are the ones that may indicate which patients are better suited for NIMV. Methods: Retrospective observational study of all adult patients ad- mitted to the ICU (mixed ICU) between March 2014 and April 2016but data presented in this abstract is a preliminary report as we pre-tend to add more patients in the ongoing months. Patients with DNR order were excluded as well as patients that required endo- tracheal intubation in the first 2 hours after the beginning of NIMV.Patient's data was analyzed with the purpose of finding cutoff pointsin blood gas values that could suggest which patients had a better outcome. Patients divided in two groups (survivors or non-survivors) and mean values were compared using Student's ttest. A pvalue of less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.Results: 52 patients were included and their data analyzed: n = 22 (42.3 %) were female and n = 30 (57.7 %) male, with a mean age of 74 \u00b1 12 (36 -94). Of all, n = 15 (29 %) required endotracheal intub- ation; overall mortality rate was 23.1 % (n = 12). Patients whosurvived had higher PaO 2/FiO 2ratio than those who did not ( p= 0.04) and tend towards higher PaCO 2levels although pvalues were not statistically significant ( p= 0.07). ARF cause with the highest mor- tality was cardiogenic acute pulmonary edema in n = 5 patients(41.7 %). Conclusion: The use of NIMV can be considered as an alternative to endotracheal intubation in hypercapnic patients while the benefit ofits use has not been proven in severe hypoxemia (PaO 2/FiO 2ratio less than 100) at least in our group of patients and it actually may lead to a worst outcome.

A modified technique of dilatational in coagulopathic patients having difficult anatomy asassessed real-time ultrasound S. Gupta, D. Govil, S. Srinivasan, S.J. Patel, J.K. N, - Medanta- The Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A540 Introduction: The recent literature has demonstrated the feasibility of ultrasound in performing PCT in coagulopathic patients with less complications(1) but none of the studies have included patients with coagulopathy and difficult neck anatomy by ultrasound.Objectives: To validate the new technique of performing PCT in a patient with unsatisfactory neck anatomy as defined by a innovative classification under real time ultrasound. Methods: We prospectively conducted this pilot study of 28 PCT in coagulopathic patients. We defined the neck anatomy in three cat-egories depending on the presence of blood vessels in the track of needle even at the lowest visible inter-tracheal space on ultrasound. The unsatisfactory category was defined as presence of multiple ves-sels in the centre of the field, good category had one blood vessel inthe centre of the field, excellent category had clean procedure field with no blood vessels. The technique that we adopted in PCT in un- satisfactory category was liberal instillation of 2 % Xylocaine in theskin and subcutaneous tissue between the vessels and creating a po-tential space for the needle. We also avoided putting any predeter- mined incision on the skin during the procedure and followed an entire seldinger technique by dilating the skin and subcutaneous 5Fr tracheal dilator provided in Portex\u00ae ULTRAperc\u00ae.The entire procedure was done under real time ultrasound guidance. Blood loss was estimated by the number of gauze pieces soaked with blood with one gauze piece soaking 5 ml.Results: The average local anesthesia requirement was around 10 ml for instillation. The INR ranged from 2.1 to 2.9 and the platelet count ranged from 20,000 to 75,000. None of the patients required any blood product transfusion. The maximum blood loss was 15 ml andnone of the patients required abandoning of the procedure.Conclusions: This modification of the classical technique of PCT in patients having unfavorable neck anatomy resulted in increased safety with minimal blood loss. Ultrasound guidance is a very usefulmodality to define such unfavorable neck anatomy which are nonamenable by just palpation of neck. Correction of coagulopathy may not be mandatory if real-time ultrasound is used during this modified technique of PCT. References 1. Rajajee V, Williamson AC, West TB.

A541 The usefulness of delta neutrophil index for predicting superimposed pneumonia in patients with acute decompensated heart failure at the emergency department Y.S. Cha1, S.J. Lee2 1Yonsei University, Wonju College of Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea;2Yonsei University, Wonju College of Medicine. Department of Internal Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea Correspondence: Y.S. Cha - Yonsei University, Wonju College of Medicine, Emergency Medicine, Wonju, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A541 Introduction: Respiratory infections have long been recognized as precipitators of exacerbations and a concomitant pneumonia has been reported in 7-10 % of acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) patients. Detecting patients, who present with an ADHF and signs of superimposed pneumonia, is difficult because of the non- specific nature of physical examination or chest x-ray abnormalities in the setting of cardiogenic pulmonary edema. Nahm et al. devel- oped neutrophil delta neutrophil index (DNI) as a new indicator for immature neutrophils and DNI expression is induced by bacterial infection. Objectives: No information is available on the clinical usefulness of DNI with respect to the diagnosis of superimposed pneumonia in pa- tients with ADHF. Therefore, we evaluated the presence of difference of initial DNI according to presence of pneumonia in patients with ADHF, the predictive value of DNI and the usefulness of DNI in com- bination with C-reactive protein (CRP), which is the commonly used for predicting inflammation and infection in the ED, for diagnosis of superimposed pneumonia in patients presenting with ADHF at the ED. Methods: This is a retrospective and observational study of consecu- tive patients more than 18 years of age who were diagnosed with an ADHF in the ED over a 7 month period. Patients were categorized by the ADHF group and the superimposed pneumonia group. Serum C- reactive protein (CRP), DNI, and -natriuretic peptide (BNP) were measured upon ED arrival. Results: The superimposed pneumonia group included 78 patients (38.4 %). Median initial DNI and CRP were significantly higher in the superimposed pneumonia group (0 % vs. 1.2 %, p < 0.001 and 0.52 mg/dL vs. 7.33 mg/dL, p < 0.001), respectively. In the receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve for initial DNI and serum CRP for differentiating superimposed pneumonia in ADHF patients, area under curve (AUC) of DNI [0.800 (95 % confidence interval 0.737- CRP [0.834 (95 % confidence interval 0.774-0.883)] wereall good and there was no a statistical difference of AUC between two inflammatory markers (p = 0.367). The AUC of the initial DNI and CRP combination [0.862 (95 % CI 0.806-0.907)] was not significantly higher than the AUC for initial CRP alone [0.834 (95 % CI 0.774-.883)] (p = 0.099). Conclusions: Initial DNI was significantly higher in the superimposed pneumonia group than in the ADHF group and the prediction ability for ADHF with superimposed pneumonia of initial DNI in the ED was as good as those of serum CRP.

Tyagi - Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, India Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A542 Introduction: Gas exchange is more severely impaired in H1N1-ARDS often necessitating rescue therapies.Those with severe ARDS if can\u00b4t be offered ECMO have Prone ventilation as only option. Prone venti- lation1hasn't been studied in details as far as H1N1-ARDS is concerned. Objectives: We examined whether early application of prone posi- tioning would improve survival among patients with severe H1N1 ARDS. We also tried to assess feasibility of prolonged proning (>20 Hours) Method: A single center observational study of 61 adult patients, with PCR confirmed H1N1 infection, admitted between December 1, 2014 & June 31, 2015. Patients with severe ARDS as per Berlin definition, after 6 -12 hours of mechanical ventilation were assigned to undergo prone- positioning sessions of at least 20 hours or stay supine as per family/ treating physician\u00b4s decision. Patients who ended receiving ECMO were excluded. Those who had P/F ratio 1.0 on FiO 20.8 and PEEP 10 cmH 2Oa t end of 20 hrs were kept further proned in sets of 4 hrs till they achieved this goal and then turned supine. The primary outcome was 28 days all cause mortality after inclusion. Respiratory characteristics,effect of first prone ventilation on the P:F ratio and PEEP requirement,complications and clinical outcome were collected. Results: 31 patients had severe ARDS after 6 -12 hours of mechanical ventilation. 28 days mortality rate in these patients was 51.61 %(n = 16). Mean P:F ratio was 0.73 + 0.14. All patients had a Compliance of < 20 ml/cmH 2O (Mean cpl 16.3 + 1.52 ml/cmH 2O). 17 patients were turned to prone position within 48 hours of mech- anical ventilation. 13 patients remained in supine position,1 patient with 26 week preg- nancy received HFOV. Mortality rates in prone & supine group were 47.05 % (n = 8) & 61.53 % (n = 8) respectively. (p = 0.431) 12 patients showed a significant increase in P:F ( 30 %) but only 8 showed a concomitant decrease in PEEP ( 2cmH2O) at the end of first prone session. Target end points of proning got achieved in 11 patients. Mean duration of prone session was 21.97 + 6.17 hours. Average number of prone sessions was 2.5 among survivors & 4.5 among non-survivors. Fig. 48 (abstract A540). Blood lossIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 281 of 6077 patients received session of prolonged prone positioning (>24 hrs) out of which 4 (57.14 %) survived. Complications: 10 patients needed to stop enteral feeding transiently during prone session due to increased residual gastric aspirate. 9 patients had Grade 1 pressure sores on the face. 1 patient in prolonged proning had sudden cardiac arrest during the prone session. Conclusions: Easy feasibility & rapid response assessment make prone ventilation an ideal choice for the initial treatment of patients with severe H1N1-ARDS. For who can not be put on ECMO for various reasons, prolonged proning is an option as rescue therapy and should be evaluated by RCTs.

Ayachi - Farhat Hached University Hospital, Medical Intensive Care Unit, Sousse, Tunisia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A543 Introduction: Use of generic drugs, which are bioequivalent to brand-name drugs, is now a common practice. However, there is still concern among patients and physicians that brand-name drugs are more efficient than generic drugs (1). Objectives: To compare efficiency and tolerance of two marketed forms: original brand-name (NIMBEX\u00ae) and generic (CISATREX\u00ae) cisatracurium-induced paralysis in Material and methods: A cross-over, randomized, double-blind physiological trial. Was compared, neuromuscular blockade induced respectively by the original brand-name and generic continuous cisa- tracurium infusion during two successive periods, separated by a one hour washout period. Neuromuscular function was monitored by vis- ual estimation of the contractions (number and height) of the thumb in response to a calibrated train-of-four (TOF) stimulation every 5 mi- nutes. A continuous infusion of cisatracurium was started at 0.06 mg 1kg1h1. The cisatracurium infusion rate was then increased by in- crements of 0.03 mg1kg1h1every thirty minutes to reach and sus- tain a TOF of 2/4. Were measured, the delay of paralysis defined by the time needed from infusion onset to reach a TOF of 2/4 and re- spective recovery times defined by the time needed to reach a TOF of 4/4 after stopping cisatracurium infusion. Under optimized sed- ation and ventilation, patients admitted for hypoxemic acute respira- tory failure with a P/F < 200 and requiring paralysis were enrolled. Patient's characteristics and SAPS II score were assessed at admission. Ramsay sedation scale, respiratory and hemodynamic parameters, P/ F ratio were evaluated at baseline. Tolerance was assessed by signifi- cant variations (>30 %) of heart rate and/or systolic blood pressure. Number needed to demonstrate a significant difference between the delays to reach a TOF of 2/4 in the two studied cisatracurium forms was estimated at 22 patients. Results: Twenty two patients were included. Median age was 56[41, 73] years. 14(61,9 %) were male. 17(77.3 %) had ARDS and 5(22.7) had status asthmaticus. Median SAPS II at admission, 34[25, 43]. 11(52,3 %) patients had a PaO 2/FIO 2ratio 100. Median paralysisdelay was Figure. respective TOF kinetics in the two forms of cisatracurium. The median recovery time from paralysis was respectively 60[40, 80]min in NIMBEX\u00ae and 60[42, 78]min in CISATREX\u00ae (p = 0.924). There was no significant hemodynamic variations neither in NIMBEX\u00ae nor in CISATREX\u00ae. Conclusion: The present study revealed no significant difference in efficacy as in tolerance between original brand-name NIMBEX\u00ae and generic (CISATREX\u00ae) of cisatracurium.

Walter Royal Surrey County Hospital, Intensive Care, Guildford, UK Correspondence: R. Jennings_Royal Surrey County Hospital, Intensive Care, Guildford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A544 Introduction: The Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS) records the level of sedation of a patient from 5 to +4, and has been used in the Royal Surrey County Hospital Intensive Care Unit since Novem- ber 2012. Maintaining optimum levels of sedation (RASS 2 to 0) im- proves clinical outcomes (1). Objectives: The objectives of this audit were to assess the median level of sedation in ventilated patients, record any variation in score at different times of day or night and measure the frequency of re- corded score. This audit was then repeated to measure any improve- ment in practice. Methods: All patients sedated and ventilated during July 2015 were audited and then re-audited in November 2015. Patients were ex- cluded if it was felt that reducing the level of sedation was inappropriate. Results: 300 scores were obtained during July 2015 and 672 in No- vember 2015. The median sedation score was 2 in July and 3i n November. 41.5 % were too heavily sedated at 3 or below in July and 53.3 % in November. The majority of scores were recorded frequently with 84 % of pa- tients in July having a score recorded at least every 2 hours and 91 % in November. Conclusions: Sedation scores are being recorded frequently, with few long gaps for either month. Sedation protocols should be used in order to target the lowest possible levels of sedation. There should Fig. 49 (abstract A543).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 282 of 607be discussion around whether targets should be different at night compared with daytime. There has been no improvement in sedation practice in Novembercompared with July 2015. Fewer than half ( 45.5 % ) of patients were sedated to optimum levels in July and this fell to 38.2 % in Novem- ber. There may be merit in maintaining an infusion of the opioid, whilst reducing or stopping the hypnotic, rather than stopping bothcompletely. Maintaining staff awareness of the benefits of optimisingsedation is prudent. References 1. Barr JL, Fraser GL, Puntillo K, Ely EW. Et al.

Candeias, Z. Costa e Silva University Hospital of Santa Maria, CHLN, Intensive Care Department, Lisbon, PortugalCorrespondence: J.M. Ribeiro - University Hospital of Santa Maria, CHLN, Intensive Care Department, Lisbon, Portugal Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A545 Introduction: The management of severe Legionella pneumonia can include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to rescue those patients which develop refractory hypoxemia or extreme re- spiratory acidosis. However, some physicians remain skeptical aboutthis approach, considering that evidence is very weak and only de-rived from case series from single ECMO centers. We believe that reporting experience from diverse centers is important to expand the knowledge and the predictors of benefit from ECMO support in pa-tients with Legionella pneumonia. Objectives: Clinical, physiological, functional and biomechanical characterization of a population with severe Legionella pneumonia treated with extracorporeal life support in a ELSO recognized ECMOcentre.Methods: Protocol-driven prospective registration and analysis of data from a population of 9 patients diagnosed with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) secondary to Legionella infection, with additional respiratory physiology evaluation andcharacterization during the ECMO run treatment. Results: From 2013 to 2015, nine patients with Legionella pneumonia and severe ARDS have failed conventional mechanical ventilationand were treated with extracorporeal ( Quadrox HLS or Oxygenator System from Maquet). Median age was 46.6 \u00b1 12.3 and all patients were male. ECMO criteria admission were hypoxemia (median pre-ECMO PaO2:FiO 2of \u00b1 0,16 43.7 \u00b1 9.8. cannulation was 4.4 \u00b1 2.2 days, which repre- sented a very early strategy to ECMO implementation. Initial staticcompliance was 25.9 \u00b1 7.6 ml/cmH 2O, did not changed significantly by day four (27.7 \u00b1 13,4), and improved to 38.1 \u00b1 13.4 by day seven. Six patients were smokers, six had acute kidney injury AKIN 3 and three had circulatory shock. During ECMO run, all patients were add-itionally conventionally ventilated with a lung rest strategy (Vt2.0 ml/kg, driving pressure below 15 cmH 2O and PEEP of 10 to 14 mmHg). Seven patients were treated with azithromycin and two patients with levofloxacin. We did not prescribed corticosteroids inany patient. All patients survived ECMO run (median time of 9.8 \u00b14.5 days) and hospital discharge.Conclusions: We showed excellent results derived from a strategy of extracorporeal oxygenation in patients with the most severe forms of Legionella pneumonia. We believe that early referral and early imple- mentation of a protocol-driven ECMO technique, with better under-standing of its physiological and management principles, might improve the outcomes of patients with severe Legionella pneumonia.

A546 Percutaneus tracheostomy complications in Hospital Juarez de Zamora Gomez - Hospital Juarez de M\u00e9xico, ICU, Mexico City, Mexico Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A546 Introduction: Percutaneous Tracheostomy is a procedure commonly performed in the intensive care unit1, being considered as first choice in patients in critical condition due to the lower rate of complications asso-ciated with this procedure2, reports of perioperative complications ran- ging from 2 to 6 %3such as bleeding, death, false passage, extubating, pneumothorax, emphysema, hypertension and inability to perform thetechnique; Postoperative complications were reported from 9 to 17 %3, including bleeding, displaced tube, pneumothorax, infection and death. In our intensive care unit we have one year experience of performing percutaneous tracheostomy, with very low rate of complications so far.Objectives: To determine the incidence of complications related to per- cutaneous tracheostomy in critical ill patients in our intensive care unit. Methods: A retrospective study was conducted in our intensive care unit during March of 2015 to February of 2016, counting 23 patientswho underwent percutaneous tracheostomy for any indication, andthe complications observed in each procedure were recorded in a data collection sheet. Results: We obtained a population of 23 patients, 11 females and 12 males, all diagnoses of these patients were divided into groups, in-cluding 9 patients with lung disease (39.2 %), 7 patients with neuro- logical disease (30.4 %), and 7 patients with abdominal disease (30.4 %), with an average of 8.47 days of mechanical ventilation, andan average of 15.4 minutes duration of the percutaneous tracheos-tomy, in which 2 episodes of extubating without clinical repercussion as perioperative complications were reported (8.9 %), and a tube dis- placement which required endotracheal intubation as a postopera-tive complication (2.3 %).Conclusions: We observed a low incidence of perioperative compli- cations in our patient population, as well as a very low incidence of postoperative complications compared with that reported in thereviewed articles, no serious complications in any patient who per-form percutaneous tracheostomy were observed. We strongly recom- mend percutaneous tracheostomy as a safe method to the bedside of most patients in critical condition, regardless of their disease. References 1.

Mildh - University of Helsinki and Helsinki University Hospital, Helsinki, Finland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A547 Introduction: Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is a frequently encountered syndrome in the critically ill. While the role of AKI in increasing short-term mortality is evident, results regarding its role in long-term mor-tality are conflicting. Advanced age and pre-existing co-morbidities are known risk factors for AKI and also the main determinants for the long term-mortality of initial survivors of intensive care (1).Objectives: To determine whether AKI is an independent risk factor for increased three-year mortality among 30-day survivors of critical care. Methods: This prospective study enrolled 2901 patients from 17 Finnish intensive care units (ICU) in 2011 -2012. In this analysis, we in- cluded 30-day survivors of the cohort. We compared the crude three-year mortality of AKI and non-AKI patients and adjusted for confounders using Cox proportional hazard model. We performedsensitivity analyses by excluding patients with 1) chronic kidney dis-ease (CKD), 2) stage 1 AKI, or 3) CKD, stage 1 AKI only, or an esti- mated pre-admission creatinine. Results: The study included 2336 30-day survivors of intensive care. Of these, 808 (34.6 %, 95 % CI 32.7 %-36.5 %) developed AKI accord-ing to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes -criteria. The crude mortality at three years was 190/808 (23.5 %, 20.6 %-26.4 %) in the AKI patients and 289/1528 (18.9 %, 17.0 %-20.9 %) in the non-AKIpatients ( p= 0.010). In adjusted Cox model, AKI was not an inde- pendent risk factor for three-year mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 1.05; CI 95 % 0.86-1.27, p= 0.644), whereas age (HR 1.03; 1.03-1.04), chronic (HR 1.63; 1.26-2.10), poor premorbid functional performance were. Pre-existing ar- teriosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, systolic heart failure, thrombo-philia and characteristics of the ICU admission and treatment(operative admission, higher SAPS II score without age and renal points, use of vasoactives and severe sepsis) did not independently associate with an increased hazard for three-year mortality. In thesensitivity analyses, AKI was not associated with an increased hazardfor three-year mortality. Conclusions: Our findings imply that increased long-term mortality among patients with AKI who survive critical illness is not related to AKIper se , but rather to increased age and pre-existing comorbidities.

Zaleska-Kociecka - Institute of Cardiology, Cardiac Intensive Care Clinic, Warsaw, Poland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A548 Introduction: After years of negligence, a kidney-brain crosstalk has become an issue [1].The link between cognitive impairment andchronic kidney disease is widely acknowledged. Less is known aboutthe influence of AKI. Recently, an increase of serum beta-2 micro- globulin (B2M), an uremic toxin, was proved to be associated with cognitive decline (CD) in mice [2].Objectives: To investigate relation between acute and chronic changes of kidney biomarkers: B2M, creatinine, cystatin C, NGAL and aortic valve replacement (AVR) Methods: Eighty over 70-year-old consecutive pts with severe aortic stenosis undergoing surgical AVR (SAVR, n = 40) or trascatheter AVR(TAVR, n = 40) were enrolled in prospective, observational single- centre study. All biomarkers were tested before AVR and 6, 12, 18, 24, 36 and 48 h afterwards, at discharge and at 6-month follow-up.Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) was follow-up. Results: B2M levels correlated with lower MMSE score at all time-points: at baseline (0.305; p = 0.01), athospital discharge (0.296; < 0.001). Correlations of other biomarkers were inconsistent. There was also correlation between B2M increase from baseline to dis- charge and CD, (drop in MMSE) over hospital stay (309; p = 0.009).This was not observed within other biomarkers.The risk of in-hospital CD was significantly higher in pts with B2M in- crease over the median change of 0.42 mg/dl (OR 2.66;95 % CI 1.02- 6.94; p = 0.043). None such relation was noted with other biomarkers.Univariate log. regression analysis indicated trend for association be-tween in-hospital B2M increase and CD (OR 2.02; 95 % CI 0.994-4.09; p = 0.052). Significant risk factors were baseline MMSE (OR 1.32; 95 % CI 1.09-1.6; p = 0.004) and max. postprocedural CRP 0.035). In log.regression analysis adjustedfor demographic variables, typical cardiovascular and periprocedural risk factors in-hospital increase of B2M was third the most associated with CD (OR 2.55; 95 % CI 0.878-7.38; p = 0.085). It followed higherbaseline MMSE (OR 0.703; % p = and dia-betes mellitus (OR 4.32; 95 % CI 0.92-20.4; p = 0.065). We did not find relation between changes of B2M and cognition over the follow-up. The connection could have been obscured bymultimorbidities burden in this population.Conclusions: Our study is the first in human to report relation be- tween acute changes of uremic toxin and cognition with B2M as a key player. By analogy to cardio-renal syndrome, four types of neuro-renal syndrome should become an issue. References 1. Lu, R., Kiernan et al. Kidney-brain crosstalk in the acute and chronic set- ting.

Universitario Central Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A549 Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a serious complication in patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) which increases morbidity and mortality. Controversy exist about the associated riskfactors.Objectives: The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence of AKI in cardiac ICU and related risk factors. Methods: Retrospective observational study of patients admitted to a Cardiac ICU who developed AKI between 2004 and 2014. AKI wasdefined as impaired renal function with elevation to twice baseline serum creatinine or need renal replacement therapy (RRT). Demo- graphic data and clinical variables to determine AKI incidence werecollected. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, risk factors for AKIdevelopment and history of intraoperative blood products transfu- sion were analyzed. Values expressed as mean + SD or %.Signifi- cant variables in the univariate analysis were entered into amultivariate logistic regression model to calculate the Odds Ratio(OR) with confidence interval of 95 %. Results: We analyzed a series of 8146 patients, mostly males (64.8 %), age 66.92 +/ 12.60 years. Patients origin: 6171 (75.8 %) underwent cardiac surgery of valve replacement and / or coronarybypass graft, 507 (6.2 %) of hospitalization floor, 478 (5.9 %) of Emer- gency Department, 354 (4.3 %) of Coronary Care Unit, 307 (3.8 %) from other Hospitals, 149 (1.8 %) other ICU, 123 (1.5 %) after cardiaccatheterization, and 57 (0.7 %) postoperative Care Unit. AKI devel-oped in 763 patients (9.5 %).Two groups were compared. Group 0: without AKI and group 1 with AKI development during ICU stay. Pa- tients in group +/ 21.21 days; patients in AKI group died (50.2 %) and 20.3 % were treated with RRT. The subgroup of patients undergoing cardiac surgery who developed AKI had ahigher baseline creatinine, urea and LOGISTIC EUROSCORE: 1.05 +/ p < 0.001, respectively. They also received more intraoperative red blood cells 1.62 +/ 2.32 vs 2.88 +/ 2.26 p < 0.001, plasma 1.25+/ 1.80 vs 2.59+/ 2.19 p 0.40+/ 0.74 p < 0.001. In the multivalent analysis intraoperative red blood cells, plasma and plate- lets transfusion proved to be independents factors for the develop-ment of AKI in ICU: OR 1.147 CI 2.515) p < 0.001, respectively. Conclusions: age > 70 years old, baseline creatinine, baseline urea, preoperative hemoglobin were risk factors for development of AKI inour study. Intraoperative transfusion of packed red blood cells, plasma and platelets were independents factors of development of AKI after cardiac surgery.A550 Incidence of acute kidney injury in critically ill patients varies with the definition usedJ.

(1, 2) The incidence of AKI in critically ill patients varies substantially with the population evaluated and the definitions used. (1, 3, 4) We aimed to assess how the timi ng and the incidence of AKI varies with AKI definitions, both with and without using urine output criteria.Methods: We included all patients admitted to our 42 bed intensive care unit (ICU) from 1 stJanuary 2014 until the 11thof June 2014. Inci- dences of AKI and timing were estimated using RIFLE, AKIN andKDIGO definitions.Results. A total of 1376 critically ill patients were included in our cohort. AKI incidence proportions varied from 15 to 21 % using RIFLE, AKIN and KDIGO serum creatinine criteria. AKI incidence proportions varied from 35to 38 % when urine output criteria were added to the RIFLE, AKIN andKDIGO definitions. AKI was detected after a median of 24 hours (IQR 24 - 48 hours) using serum creatinine criteria and AKI was detected after a median of 13 hours (IQR 7 -23 hours) using urine output criteria. Conclusion. Incidences of AKI are influenced by which definition is used.Addition of urine output criteria to serum creatinine criteria may result in a doubling of AKI incidences and an eleven hours time gain in a critically ill population.

Roberts, C. Caballero, G. Isgro, D. HallRoyal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation London, Hernandez Caballero - Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A551 Introduction: BACKGROUND. The incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI) occurring in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) ranges from30 % to 60 %. It has shown to be an important predictor of morbidityand mortality in the critically ill and continuous renal replacement therap- ies represent a cornerstone in its management. The Kidney Disease Im- proving Global Outcomes Guideline (KDIGO Guideline) on renal supportIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 285 of 607for AKI suggests initiating CRRT when life-threatening changes in fluid, electrolyte and acid -base balance exist. Objectives: To determine the incidence and prognosis of AKI requir- ing CRRT in a tertiary cardiothoracic centre. Methods: Of the 1829 patients admitted to level 3 areas in Harefield Hospital during 2015, 229 required CRRT (12.52 %). 161 (70 %) were male, with a median age of 59 years. 109 (47.6 %) were hypertensive and 55 (24 %) were diabetic. The most frequent reason for admission was cardiac surgery (36.2 %, 83 patients), followed by medical admis- sions from the cardiology ward (10 %, 23 patients) and patients on veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO, 10 %, 23 patients); further breakdown is shown in Fig. 50. The most prevalent indication for initiation of CRRT was metabolic acidosis (58.5 %, 134 patients), followed by fluid overload (15.3 %, 24 pa- tients) and uraemia (13.1 %, 30 patients). 69.9 % of the patients were haemodynamically unstable when CRRT was initiated (as defined by the need for two or more vasoactive drugs). The ITU mortality in the CRRT group was 36.2 % (83 patients) compared with 6.01 % (110 pa- tients) in the general group admitted to level 3 areas. The mean length of stay in ITU was 18 days in the CRRT group vs. 3.6 days in the general level 3 group. Conclusions: Acute kidney injury is associated with an increased risk of morbidity, mortality, and length of stay. In our tertiary cardiothor- acic unit metabolic acidosis is the most frequent indication. References: Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) Acute Kidney Injury Work Group.

Beitland - University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A552 Introduction: New biomarkers are important for early detection of acute kidney injury (AKI), but few studies have previously evaluated the stability. OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate whether timing of centrifugation and/or storage time in a refrigerator influenced the measured concentrations of urinary AKI biomarkers. Methods: Ten adult intensive care unit patients (with and without AKI) donated urine aliquoted into 8 aliquots of 2 ml. Half of the ali- quots were centrifuged (500 RCF, 20 \u00b0C, 5 minutes) early (immedi- ately) and the remaining late (after thawing). Aliquots were stored in a refrigerator for 0, 1, 2 and 3 days and frozen at 70 \u00b0C before ana- lyses.

Measured concentrations are reported as median (interquartile range), and compared using a 2-tailed paired Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: Biomarker concentrations were similar in aliquots with early versus (vs.) late centrifugation not stored in a refrigerator (Cystatin C 1342 (52 3200) 1402 (39 -2661) ng/ml, p = 0.26 and NephroCheck 0.22 (0.09-3.10) vs. 0.23 (0.08-2.32), p = 0.77, respectively). Biomarker levels were comparable in early centrifuged aliquots stored in a refrigerator for 0 vs. 3 days (Cystatin C 1342 (52 -3960) 0.26 and NephroCheck 0.22 (0.09-3.10) vs. 0.26 (0.09-2.46), p = 0.29, respectively). Conclusions: The measured concentrations of urinary Cystatin C, NGAL and the NephroCheck test were not influenced by timing of centrifugation and/or storage in a refrigerator up to three days.

Garc\u00eda Huertas_Complejo Hospitalario de Granada, Intensive Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A553 Introduction: Diverse biomarkers are employed for diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) and in the last years, new biomarkers are being studied for the early detection of this disease. Objective: The aim of this work is to study if measurement of amino- peptidasic activities in different urine fractions may be of interest in the early diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients undergone to cardiac surgery. Methods: A prospective, single-center and observational study was carried out in urine samples from patients undergone to cardiac sur- gery obtained at arrival to Critical Care Unit. Urine samples were cen- trifugated 10 minutes at 1000 g and supernatants (S1) were centrifugated 15 minutes at 17000 g to remove cellular fragments and other debris. Supernatants were subjected to ultracentrifugation 60 minutes at 200.000 g to obtain exosomic fraction a final supernatant Glutamyl aminopeptidase (GluAp) and alanyl Fig. 50 (abstract A551).

Indication for CRRTIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 286 of 607aminopeptidase (AlaAp) activities in the different urine fractions were quantified by fluorimetry in samples from patients. Results: The study included 143 patients, 80 of them developed AKI. GluAp activity was significatively increased in patients that devel-oped AKI after surgery (p < 0.05 vs. no AKI) in S1 and S2 superna- tants. AlaAp activity was increased (p < 0.05) only in S2 supernatant. No differences were found in cellular or exosomic fractions from pa-tients that developed AKI vs. no AKI patients. ROC-AUCs to distin-guish AKI from no AKI patients were greater for AlaAp and GluAp in S2 than in S1 supernatant, and they were also greater than ROC-AUC for proteinuria, albuminuria, NAG and NGAL.Conclusions: Aminopeptidasic enzymes can be detected in cellular, exosomic and soluble fractions of urine. Measurement of GluAp and AlaAp in soluble fraction improves sensitivity and specificity for early diagnosis of AKI in patients undergone to cardiac surgery.

Masjedi - Anesthesiology and Critical Care Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A554 Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common clinical problem in critically ill patients, independently predicts poor outcome.Despite significant improvements in therapeutics, its mortality and morbidityremains high. A major reason for this is the lack of early markers forAKI and hence an unacceptable delay in initiating therapy. AKI, as a component of the crush syndrome, is the second cause of death after direct trauma, although it can be prevented by early and vigor-ous intravenous fluid therapy .Few studies have evaluated the epi-demiology of AKI in trauma. Objectives: To evaluate and compare the predictive value of serum cystatin-c (Cys-c) with creatine phosphokinase(CPK) for AKI in adulttrauma patients admitted in ICU.Methods: Retrospective interrogation of prospectively collected data of 300 adult trauma patients aged 18 years admitted and stayed more than 24 hours in ICU were done . We measured serum cystatin-c(Cys-c) and creatine phosphokinase (CPK) of previously collected andfreezed serum samples. Impression of AKI was applied according to RI- FLE criteria in intensive care unit within first 24 hr (early AKI) then asso- ciation of Cys-c and CPK with different stages of AKI were evaluated.Results: The median age was 34.8 (1 8 -80) years, 90 % were male. The crude prevalence of AKI was 193 (65 %) with a maximum RIFLE category of Risk in 1 21 (40.3 %), Injury in 67 (22.3 %), and Failure 5 (1.7 %). Younger age and male sex were independently associatedwith higher risk of AKI in the first 24 hours after trauma . Mean APA-CHE IV score between AKI and Non-AKI groups were not statistically different. Considering serum Cys-c, the lower frequency of AKI (1 44,63.2 %) was observed among the patients with Cys-c < 0.78 andthe higher (49, 71 %) among the patients with Cys-c 0.78 (p value = 0.001). According to serum CPK, the lowest frequency of AKI (87, 56.1 %) was observed among the patients with CPK < 2000 and the highest (1 8, 90 %) among the patients with CPK of 5000 -1 0000 (p value = 0.003). For diagnosis of AKI, Cys-c showed to have significantodds ratio of 5.874 (p value: with 1,79-1 9.23) in com- parison with CPK which had no correlation (odds ratio of 1). The pre- dictive diagnostic performance of both Cys-c and CPK were fair onthe first day (area under the curve 0.565 and 0.61 8, respectively) byplotting ROC curveConclusions: In adult trauma victims admitted in ICU, serum Cys-c but not CPK could predict development of early AKI .

A555 Predictive model for acute tubular necrosis complications and the need for early renal replacement therapyJ.A. Diaz1,2, Leon, Mexico; 2Universidad de Guanajuato, Intensive Care Unit, Leon, Mexico Correspondence: J.A. Diaz - Universidad de Guanajuato, Intensive Care Unit, Leon, Mexico Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A555 Introduction: Acute tubular necrosis (ATN) is an important complica- tion in critically ill patients and it is associated with the need for early renal replacement therapy (RRT) and poor prognosis1. It is multifactorial being the principal causes; hemodynamic instability and systemic in-flammatory response syndrome2. In patients with AKI, considering the hemodynamic status with Shock index (SI) and inflammatory response with serum C reactive protein (CRP)3could be predictors for the devel- opment of ATN and prepare the sources for the potential need of RRT.Objective: Determine the validity of the Predictive Model for ATN Complications (PMAC) and the need for early RRT in AKI. Methods: A prospective study conducted in critically ill adults with AKI in the Intensive Care Unit from UMAE1 to evaluate the validity ofa predictive model (PMAC) for the development of ATN, complica-tions and the need for early RRT. Sampling was not probabilistic with a total of 30 patients. The inclusion criteria were all critically ill adult's age between 18 -75 years old that developed AKI based on the defin- ition of KDIGO\u00b4S Guidelines 4in creatinine value and/or urinary out- put. We obtained the worst SI (Cardiac rate/Systolic arterial pressure) from the patient's vital signs registration and CRP serum level in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl). PMAC is obtained by theproduct of Shock index and CRP. We defined ATN by Sodium excre-tion fraction (FeNa) more than 2 %, urine nitrogen excretion fraction (FeUrea) more than 55-63 % and/or the evidence of granular casts in urinalysis. We also registered the AKI complications and if RRT wasneeded in the first 72 hrs.Results: We evaluated the ROC curves using PMAC. A PMAC 9.8 predicts development of ATN with a sensitivity of 92 % and specifi- city of 76 %. PMAC 14 predicts development of any complication due to AKI with a sensitivity of 85 % and specificity of 88 %. PMAC 23 predicts the need for early RRT with a sensitivity of 88 % and spe- cificity of 95 %. Conclusions: In critically ill patients that present AKI, PMAC is an easy to obtain, accurately and cheap predictor. A cut off 9.8 is helpful to foretell diagnosis of ATN, 14 predicts development of AKI compli- cations and 23 the need for early RRT. References 1. De Mendonca A, Vincent JL, Suter PM, et al.

The search for a reliable kidney injury biomarker is an area of continuous re- search interest. Objectives: To determine weather uNGAL and/or uIL-18 are good predictors of acute kidney injury (AKI). Methods: In this study, we examine urine neutrophil associated lipo- calin (uNGAL) and urine interleukin (IL)-18 as predictors of AKI in comparison to serum creatinine in 30 patients admitted to ICU. Results: We did not find any clear role of both biomarkers in the diagnosis and evaluation of patients with AKI. Urine NGAL and IL-18 did not show any statistical significance between patients who devel- oped AKI versus those who did not. Although, our results showed that uIL-18 is found to be elevated in patients who developed AKI at the day of ICU admission AUC-ROC 0.805 (95 % CI: 0.514 - 1.0) and a level of 1000 pg/ml was specific but not sensitive in diagnosing AKI. Conclusions: Urine NGAL and IL-18 role in diagnosing AKI cannot be clearly identified by comparing them to serum creatinine owing to the fact of different clinical value of both biomarkers.

Apart from removing water soluble and albumin bound substances it is able to counteract severe acid -base-disequilibrium on an individualized basis. Objectives: Aim of this study is to quantify the ADVOS\u00ae\u00b4 efficacy in improving respiratory acidosis in hypercapnic patients at the inten- sive care unit. Methods: Retrospective analysis of patients with acute kidney failure and respiratory acidosis that were treated with the ADVOS\u00ae-devicevia a conventional dialysis catheter at an interdisciplinary intensive care unit. Results: 10 patients were included in the analysis, 6 (60 %) were male, the mean age was 58 \u00b1 16 years. All patients were mechanicallyventilated and suffered from severe multiorgan failure. Mean SAPS II was 50 \u00b1 12 and mean SOFA-Score was 16 \u00b1 3. Parameters of mech- anical ventilation did not change significantly during treatment withthe ADVOS\u00ae device (PEEP pre11 \u00b1 4 mbar versus FiO 2post 64 \u00b1 24, p = ns, tidal volume pre 371 \u00b1 106 ml versus tidal volume post372 \u00b1 109 ml, p = ns, respiratory rate pre28 \u00b1 5 /min versus respiratory rate post 29 \u00b1 6 /min, p = ns). PaO2/FiO2 prior to treatment was 143 \u00b1 77 mmHg versus 154 \u00b170 mmHg at the end of treatment(p = ns).Mean blood flow rate of the ADVOS\u00ae device was 148 \u00b1 68 ml/min, median flow rate of the concentrate was 160 ml/h and mean dialysate-pH-setting was 8,4 \u00b10,5. Unfractioned heparin was used as 6 patientsand 4 patients had regional citrate anticoagulation.

We could not observe any device related sideeffects during treatment. 28-survival-rate of the patients was 70 %.Conclusions: ADVOS\u00ae is a new advanced dialysis device that is ap- proved in the European Union. ADVOS\u00ae is able to remove CO 2with- out an extracorporeal membrane oxygenator and to support patientswith respiratory acidosis. A558 A survey of renal replacement therapy provision in unitedkingdom adult neurointensive care unitsI. Adedugbe, G.T. Bird, Queen Square Neuroanaesthesia and Neurocritical Care Resreach Group University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UKCorrespondence: G.T. Bird - University College London Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A558 Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in approximately 8- 23 %1,2of patients on neurointensive care units (NICU) and is an in- dependent predictor of mortality, multiplying the risk of death by 6.17 times.1The proportion of patients with chronic diseases is also increasing with a consequent increase in the number of pa-tients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) on neurointen- sive care units. The immediate availability of renal replacement therapy on NICUs in the UK may therefore have an increasinglyimportant impact on the morbidity and mortality of brain injuredpatients in the future. Methods: A telephone survey of United Kingdom National Health Service (NHS) adult NICUs was undertaken, with 16 questions to illicitthe logistics of delivery of RRT to NICU patients.Results: Results were obtained from 81 % (25/31) of the adult neuro- surgical centres in the NHS. Only 40 % (10/25) of centres have a ded- icated NICU. Of these, only 4 had nursing staff trained to deliver RRT,with just 3 units possessing their own RRT equipment. 40 % (4/10) ofthe units with a dedicated NICU provided RRT on other intensive care units within the same hospital versus 33 % (5/15) of neurosurgi- cal centres with mixed critical care patients. Some centres transferredtheir patients to other hospitals within the same trust for renalreplacement therapy (30 % of dedicated NICUs versus none of the mixed intensive care units). 84 % (21/25) of units had < 30 patients a year requiring RRT. Five units used citrate regionalanticoagulation for the circuit and only 4 units had point of caretesting (ACT, TEG, ROTEM) for monitoring anticoagulation immedi- ately available on the unit. Conclusions: There are numerous barriers to the provision of renal replacement therapy in neurointensive care patients. This survey hasnot explored the physiological problems encountered with RRT in these patients, but has highlighted that the maintenance of training, competency and logistical problems sometimes affects the consist-ent, direct availability of RRT to NICU patients. This is especially trueof units without traumatic brain injury patients, where medical staff may become deskilled in the practice of RRT over time. It also high- lights the logistical challenges in providing renal replacement ther-apy in patients who are at high risk of intracranial bleeding withoutpoint of care testing immediately available to monitor the anticoagu- lation of the circuit.

Witter - Dalhousie University, Anesthesiology, Pain Management and Perioperative Medicine, Halifax, Canada Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A559 Introduction: Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) has been the rec- ognized standard of care in cardiac arrest since 1974. Several studies have demonstrated the importance of adherence to ACLS algorithms during cardiac arrests in improving return of spontaneous circula- tion1and survival to hospital discharge2. However, many residents feel unsure about their skills in resuscitation, and those who feel confident may be falsely self-assured3. Objectives: Analyse the adherence to ACLS guidelines in a standard- ized simulated cardiac arrest scenario and identify potential obstacles to guideline conformity. Methods: This study used an observational design to evaluate ad- herence to ACLS protocol in residents attending standardized car- diac event simulations. 36 residents were exposed to the same scenario of ventricular fibrillation and were filmed and reviewed by two independent scorers. Their adherence to ACLS protocols was measured using a standardized checklist based on the 2010 AHA guidelines4. Results: Overall adherence to ACLS protocol was fair (79.1 %). Residents consistently performed well in their assessment of the initial presentation (88.0 % adherence) and their initiation of chest compressions once pulselessness was detected (97.2 %). Quality of CPR was high in terms of hand placement, compres- and however half (52.8 %) of the residents failed to place the backboard under the patient. Residents struggled to keep CPR interruptions around defibrillation and rhythm analysis/pulse checks under 10 seconds (55.6 % and 59.7 % respectively). Only 63.9 % of the residents correctly identified the initial rhythm. No resident delivered a shock in under 1 minute from rhythm onset and in 36.1 % of cases it took longer than three minutes from rhythm onset to defibrillation. Conclusions: In our study residents demonstrated overall satisfactory adherence to the 2010 ACLS guidelines, especially the detection of pulselessness and initiation of CPR showed good compliance. Future training should emphasize correct rhythm analysis and the handling of CPR interruptions while performing defibrillation and rhythm/pulse checks - this could lead to a better outcome in patients suffering a cardiac arrest.

Khaliq, M. Singer UCL, Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK Correspondence: W. Khaliq - UCL, Bloomsbury Institute of Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A560 Introduction: Septic shock is associated with a severe cardiovascular stress response. Beta-blockade represents a novel way of addressing this; esmolol titrated to keep heart rate < 95 bpm in critically ill pa- tients receiving high-dose noradrenaline resulted in improved out- comes [1]. We measured a series of biomarkers of cardiac stress and injury in an observational study of critically ill patients with septic shock. We then used a long-term fluid-resuscitated rat model of sep- sis to assess the same cardiac markers. Objectives. To measure the degree of cardiac stress in critical illness using the biomarkers of cardiac injury, troponin T (cTnT) and of ven- tricular dysfunction, B-natriuretic peptide (BNP). Methods: Study 1: Observational study of 27 critically ill patients with septic shock from faecal peritonitis or community-acquired pneumo- nia. Daily measurements of cTnT and BNP were performed on days 0 to 3 (measured by ELISA). Study 2: Awake, instrumented yet fully mobile male Wistar rats (350 \u00b1 50 g) received an intraperitoneal injection of faecal slurry to induce sepsis. Fluid resuscitation (crystalloid 10 ml/kg/h) was commenced at 2 h. At 6 h, an echo-measured stroke volume rate cut-off of 0.20 ml was used to classify animals into predicted survivors (S) or non- survivors (NS) (n = 6 per group). Blood was sampled at 6 h and 24 h for cTnT and BNP (ELISA). Control animals were treated identically ex- cept for faecal slurry injection. Results were analysed using two-way ANOVA and post-hoc testing and considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results: cTNT was significantly elevated in critically ill patients on the day of ICU admission, and was significantly higher in NS (Fig. 55). BNP was significantly elevated in NS patients only. Likewise, in the experimental model of sepsis (Fig. 56), non-surviving rats had an early elevation of the same cardiac biomarkers. (p < 0.05 for both cTnT and BNP compared to survivors). Conclusions: Sepsis is associated with excess cardiac stress, as dem- onstrated in both a critically ill patient population and in a rat model of faecal peritonitis. Whether beta-blockade can be used to amelior- ate this cardiac stress is the subject of further studies. References [1] Morelli A et al.

Havaldar - St. Johns Medical College, Critical Care Medicine, Bangalore, India Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A561 Introduction: Sepsis is characterized by life threatening organ dys- function with dysregulated immune response. Cardiac dysfunction seen in sepsis is unique as it is reversible within 7 -10 days. Parker et al1in 1984, showed paradoxically,lower ejection fraction in survivors of septic shock. It was suggested that non survivors,were unable to correct the vasoplegia(reduced systemic vascular resistance). This view has been questioned by a recent meta-analysis2. A prognostic model combining biomarkers like Troponin I and echocardiographic parameters has not been well described. Objectives: To assess sepsis induced cardiac dysfunction by 2D echo- cardiography and Troponin I. Methods: After obtaining institutional ethical committee approval,a prospective observational study was done in an university medical college from February 2016 to April 2016. Inclusion criteria were pa- tients diagnosed with sepsis3.Pregnant patients and patients with poor echo window were excluded. Echocardiographic assessment was done within 48 hrs of diagnosis of sepsis by standard methods. Primary outcome was ICU mortality and secondary outcome was ICU length of stay. Statistical analysis was done using STATA12 .Indepen- dent variables identified as significant in a bivariate analysis were in- cluded as co-variates in a logistic regression model with outcome as the dependent variable. Discrimination and calibration were assessed by receiver operating characteristics(ROC) and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit tests. Results: Fifty eight patients were screened, ten were excluded due to poor echo window. Baseline characteristics and Troponin I were simi- lar in survivors and non survivors, except APACHE II, SOFA and age. Echocardiographic parameters, MAPSE, a`and E/e` were found to be statistically significant. In the logistic predictive model only APACHE II and MAPSE were found to be significant co-variates.(APACHEII co- ef 0.4869 p = 0.02, MAPSE 9.3672 p = 0.04, constant 0.7109). The dis- crimination of this model was good ROC(0.95) and calibration was satisfactory(chi2(df8),1.98, p = 0.98). Conclusions: Sepsis induced cardiac dysfunction assessed by echo- cardiography showed measurement of MAPSE when combined with APACHE II was a good predictor of mortality. Results of this study need further validation from larger study.References 1.

Dubin - Farmacolog\u00eda Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A562 Introduction: The therapeutic use of hyperoxic ventilation in critically ill patients is controversial. A major concern is the induction of arteri- olar vasoconstriction with subsequent microvascular hypoperfusion. Recently, severe sublingual microcirculatory alterations were reported with high oxygen inspired fraction in healthy volunteers. Objective: To show the effects of short-term hyperoxic ventilation on sublingual microcirculation and peripheral perfusion in patients with septic shock. Methods: The sublingual microcirculation was assessed by SDF- videomicroscopy in 11 patients with septic shock during normoxic ventilation and after 5 minutes of ventilation with FiO 2= 1.0. We also evaluated the capillary refill time (CRT). To rule out a delayed effect of hyperoxia, we studied 8 healthy volunteers in normoxia, and after 5\u00b4and 30\u00b4 of 100 % oxygen through a nasal mask. Results: In patients with septic shock, hyperoxic ventilation increased arterial PO 2from 75 57) and CRT (6.0 [4.0-9.4] vs. 8.3 [3.4-10.6]) remained unchanged.

There is a continuing controversy about whether one agent is superior to the other. Objectives: To synthesise the evidence from trials using a multiple treatment comparison methods thereby permitting a broader com- parison across multiple therapies. Methods: Randomised controlled trials in patients with shock of vasopressor drugs were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through July 2015. We performed a random-effects model within a Bayesian framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation to calculate pooled Odds Ratio and 95 % credibility intervals. The main outcome measure was death from any cause in-intensive care unit, in-hospital or 28 days. Results: We identified 23 studies with 4,406 patients allocated to 10 treatments: dopamine, epinephrine, terlipressin, vasopressin. First, pair-wise meta- analyses with a random-effects model were carried out. Second, a random-effects model multitreatment meta-analysis within a Bayes- ian framework (using Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation) was performed. We performed 2 sensitivity analyses: 1) using only septic shock subgroups and 2) double blinded trials with intention to treat analysis. We performed 45 comparisons. There was no significant between- group difference in the rate of death. In sensitivity analyses, the re- sults were qualitatively similar to the results obtained with 23 studies.Conclusions: There were no significant differences in the rate of death between patients with shock who were treated with any vaso- pressor agent.

A564 PTP1B gene deletion improves glucose metabolism and limits cardiovascular dysfunction in experimental septic shock E. Delile1, R. Nevi\u00e8re2, Rouen, 1): A564 Introduction: Hyperglycemia is a feature of septic patient and has been associated with poor outcome and higher mortality. In contrast insulin has been shown to decrease mortality and to prevent the in- cidence of multi-organ failure but is often associated with deleterious hypoglycemia. Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a negative regulator of insulin signaling and NO production. We found that PTP1B inhibition or gene deletion improved mesenteric endothelial function, reduced cardiac and vascular inflammatory markers, leading to reduced cardiac dysfunction. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to assess the poten- tial therapeutic effect of total PTP1B invalidation on glucose metabolism and cardiovascular insulin resistance using experimental model of sepsis. Methods: Thus, in order to address this question, we developed a Cecal Ligation and Puncture (CLP) model of sepsis. CLP is followed by subcutaneous fluid resuscitation. To evaluate the potential thera- peutic PTP1B invalidation, we used PTP1B/mice. study induced a signifi- cative diminution of VO2 inspired, VCO2 expired, physical activity with food and water consumption. This study characterizes a severity of our CLP model without difference between WT vs PTP1B/. Although this severe model, PTP1B/mice showed improved GTT and ITT. Moreover, the limited increase of insulinemia in CLP PTP1B /mice emphasizes the improvement of glucose metabolism. Moreover, the heart expression of cytokines showed a significative increase of inflammation and oxidative stress in WT CLP mice com- pared with PTP1B/mice. Plasmatic dosage of insulin before and 15 minutes after glucose injection showed an elevation of insulin concentration in WT CLP mice showing a functional pancreas. Insulin- and flow-mediated dilatation assessed in isolated-perfused mesenteric arteries was abolished in WT CLP mice and was improved in PTP1B/mice. Isolated perfused heart study showed that CLP induced a significa- tive reduction of left ventricular developed pressure and cardiac effi- ciency in WT and PTP1B/mice. However, efficiency cardiac study showed a different utilization of substrate between WT CLP and PTP1B/CLP, WT sham and PTP1B/sham. Moreover, we showed that PI3k/Akt molecular pathway is functional in CLP mice suggesting a GLUT4 expression or translocation alteration. In fact, GLUT4 expression study showed that in plasma membrane fraction and endosome fraction, GLUT4 expression is abolished in WT CLP mice. We also found that PTP1B/mice subjected to CLP had a higher sur- vival rate compared to WT. Fig. 57 (abstract A562).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 292 of 607Conclusions: CLP-induced sepsis changes the mechan- istic by abolishing GLUT4 expression and PTP1B inhibition restores GLUT4 expression and improves metabolic function, cardiovascularfunction and survival. This suggests that, PTP1B inhibition may be anattractive target for the treatment of sepsis. Note: This abstract has been previously published and is available at [1].

Beta-blocker therapy is associated with improved organ dys-function and survival in patients with severe, prolonged septic shock [1]. Precise mechanisms of putative benefit however remain uncertain. Objective: To investigate the impact of esmolol on the inflammatory and catecholamine stress response during sepsis.Methods: We used an awake, fluid-resuscitated rat model of faecal peritonitis in which 72 h mortality can be accurately predicted at 6 h post-insult by stroke volume (<0.20 ml) [2] and interleukin(IL)-6 [3].After the 6 h echocardiogram, rats were randomised to receive eitheresmolol (75 mcg/kg/min, preceded by a loading dose of 500 mcg/kg for one minute) or equivalent volume of placebo for the next 18 hours. Rats (n = 12) then underwent repeat echocardiography,followed by terminal blood and tissue sampling. This included plasmalevels IL-6 (pro-inflammatory levels (ELISA, Cusabio). Comparison was made against non-septic control rats (n = 6).Results were analysed using two-way ANOVA with post-hoc testing,and considered statistically significant when p < 0.05. Results: Septic animals had increased levels of IL-6 and IL-10 at 24 h that were greater in predicted non-survivors (Table 30). Esmolol sig- nificantly decreased IL-6 levels in both predicted survivors and non-survivors compared to placebo-treated rats, whereas IL-10 levels were increased by esmolol. However, no change was seen in cat- echolamine levels.Conclusions: Treatment with esmolol altered plasma cytokine bal- a more anti-inflammatory profile in both predicted sur- vivors and non-survivors in this model of faecal peritonitis. However, circulating catecholamines were unaffected.

Smit - VU University Medical Center, Intensive Care, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A566 Introduction: Hospitalized patients often receive oxygen supplemen- tation, which may lead to a supraphysiological oxygen tension (hyperoxia). Hyperoxia has hemodynamic effects, including an in- crease in vascular resistance arteriolar vasocon-striction. Despite several in-vivo, ex-vivo and in-vitro studiesinvolving humans and various types of animals, the mechanism be- hind hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction remains unclear. To en- hance our understanding of this phenomenon, we set out todevelop an experimental model of hyperoxia-induced vasoconstric-tion in murine vessels. Objectives: To develop an ex-vivo mouse model to study the under- lying mechanisms of hyperoxic vasoconstriction.Methods: Femoral arteries (conduit vessel) and gracilis- and mesen- teric arterioles (resistance vessels) were isolated from 10 -12 week old C57BL/6 mice. Vessels were pre-constricted with noradrenaline to ap- proximately 50 % of their maximal diameter for vasodilation developed no-flow pressure myography. Oxygen did not influence the endothelium- dependent dilation of femoral arteries (Fig. 58, left) or gracilis arteri- oles (Fig. 58, right). Endothelium independent dilation was not af- fected either. Comparably, oxygen tensions also did not influence the degree of spontaneous myogenic tone of mesenteric arteries or the response to arachidonic acid or noradrenaline.Conclusions: In this study, the isolated femoral artery and gracilis and mesenteric resistance arterioles from mice did not show altered vascular tone responses under hyperoxic conditions. We therefore discourage researchers to use these vessels for mechanistic researchof hyperoxic vasoconstriction.Table 30 (abstract A565).

Alegr\u00eda1, de Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A567 Introduction: The mechanisms of persistent probably multifactorial. Both hypoperfusionre- lated anaerobic production and adrenergicdriven aerobic generation have been implicated. More recently an early and severe impairment in exogenous lactate clearance has also been described [1]. Theoret- ically, an excessive adrenergic response could influence all these mechanisms and thus aggravate the problem. Some small experi- mental and clinical studies have shown favorable effects on heart rate and hemodynamic or perfusion parameters, and also in inflam- beta-blockers. Esmolol (ESM) demonstrated to improve cardiac contractibility and vascular reactivity probably in relation to an anti-inflammatory effect. In a randomized-controlled study in stable septic shock patients, esmolol reduced heart rate (HR), de- creased fluid requirements and lactate levels, and surprisingly showed a significant effect on mortality. Objectives: To assess the effects of ESM on lactate production and exogenous lactate clearance in an endotoxic shock model. Methods: Twelve anesthetized sheep were subjected to a multi- modal hemodynamic/perfusion assessment including hepatic and portal vein hepatic blood flow, sublingual microcirculation, and muscle microdialysis. After the monitoring phase, all received a 5 mcg/kg LPS bolus (E coli O127:B8\u00ae) and then 4 mcg \u0081kg1 \u0081hr1 for the rest of the experiment. After 1 hr they were volume resuscitated, and then randomized to LPS-control or LPS- ESM. Sampling and exogenous lactate clearances at different time- points (Fig. 59). ESM was started at 15 mg/h and titrated every 5 minutes to achieve a reduction of 20-30 % in relation to HR at point B. Results: ESM was hemodynamically well tolerated. Despite progres- sive hypotension in both groups, ESM was associated with lower ar- terial and portal vein lactate levels. Exogenous lactate clearance was significantly higher in ESM treated animals Table 31. Conclusions: Esmolol was associated with lower arterial and portal lactate levels, and less impairment of exogenous lactate clearance in a model of septic shock. The use of ESM appears to be associated with beneficial effects on gut lactate generation and lactate clear- ance and exhibits no negative impact on systemic hemodynamics.References 1. Tapia et al.

Objectives: To measured the effects of conventional treatment on cardiomechanics, VAC and dynEl in acute septic shock patients. Methods: In 22 intensive care septic shock patients of different aeti- ologies we measured routine hemodynamic parameters such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), cardiac index (CI), pulse pressure and stroke volume variation (PPV, SVV) via pulse contour method, as well as VAC by the non invasively method of Chen et al.[3]. We calculated dynEl as SVV/PPV. We performed measurements prior to (T0) and after 20 ml/kg fluid challenges (T1). In a subgroup of 6 patients vaso- pressor support was also given between T0 and T1. Results: In a multivariate analysis VAC was found to improve signifi- cantly in the fluid responder group (p = 0.005) fluid resuscita- tion. Arterial elastance, which is a determinant of VAC was significantly reduced in those patients (p = 0.01) and dynEl, although not significantly, decreased.

A569 Can hypoxic versus non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia in septic shock be recognized in clinical practice? A proof-of-concept retrospective studyL. Alegr\u00eda1, de 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A569 Introduction: Persistent hyperlactatemia after initial septic shock re- suscitation is associated with bad prognosis. However, at least threemechanisms involved: anaerobic clear- ance. Only the first mechanism is sensitive to further resuscitation. Thus pursuing lactate normalization with additional fluids while con-fronted to non-hypoxic causes could lead to the toxicity of over-resuscitation with no clinical benefit. To develop clinical algorithms aimed at differentiating hypoxic vs non-hypoxic profiles could have relevant clinical consequences.We hypothetized that a multimodal perfusion monitoring will aid inthis purpose, since the presence of low ScvO 2, or increased central venous-arterial pCO 2gradient, or an impaired peripheral perfusion together with hyperlactatemia might identify a hypoxic-relatedphenotype. This phenotype could be associated with worse out-comes as compared with a non-hypoxic profile. Objectives: To address this subject we perfomed a proof-of-concept retrospective study to assess if this approach can effectively differen-tiate two clinical phenotypes among hyperlactatemic septic shockpatients. Methods: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database of pa- tients with septic shock admitted to our ICU during the calendar yearof 2014. Patients with persistent hyperlactatemia committed to fullresuscitation and with complete multimodal perfusion monitoring and follow up after initial resuscitation were included. Statistical ana- lysis included t-test and chi-square. Results: 44 patients (age 64 \u00b1 16y, APACHE II 21 \u00b1 7, SOFA 9.9 \u00b1 3.5, abdominal and pulmonary main sepsis sources, hospital mortality 13.6 %) were included. No difference in basal severity, hospital mor- tality, first 24 h fluids, cardiac index or NE requirements between pa-tients with an hypoxic (36) compared to anon-hypoxic (8) lactateprofile was observed. Other results are shown in Table 32. Conclusions: Patients with a hypoxic-lactate profile required more days in the ICU, and tended to receive more MV. They also receivedmore rescue therapies and inodilators. A multimodal perfusionmonitoring might be useful to recognize a hypoxic profile among septic shock patients with persistent hyperlactatemia that appears to be associated with worse outcomes and a more complex manage-ment. Our findings should be validated in prospective studies. A570 The clinical characteristics and influence of vasopressors-induced peripheral ischemia in shock patientsS.

Park - Chonbuk National Universiy Hospital, Internal Medicine, Jeonjusi, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A570 Introduction: As a potent vasoconstrictor, vasopressors play a critical role in the management of fluid resistant hypotension in septic shock for maintain the mean arterial pressure more than 65 mm Hg. Be- cause of the wide variability in individual vasopressor requirement,the absolute maximum dose of vasopressor is difficult to determine.In general, when starting vasopressors, their doses should be titrated to the desired effect by closely monitoring the adverse effects such as hypoperfusion (particularly affecting the extremities, mesentery orkidneys), dysrhythmias, myocardial ischemia, local effects, andhyperglycemia. Objectives: We conducted the present study to assess the risk factors of inadequate perfusion of extremities during the vasopressors treat-ment in patients with severe septic shock.Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we evaluated the medical re- cords of 73 patients who received vasopressors such as norepineph- rine (NE), epinephrine, dopamine, vasopressin and dobutamine morethan 48 hours in patients with severe septic shock in the medical in-tensive care unit at a tertiary university-affiliated hospital, from April 2014 to December 2015. The patients were stratified into ischemia or non-ischemia (control) groups according to whether peripheral ische-mia developed or not.Results: A total 73 patients with septic shock were introduced vaso- pressors more than 48 hours. Basically, NE introduced in all patients but more than 2 vasopressors were 28, and 3 more than vasopres-sors were 14.

While the patients who had ischemic insults were signifi-cantly higher mortality, combined vasopressors more than 2 drugs were not significant. Conclusions: The use of vasopressors and its combined use more than 2 drugs may not influence on the development of peripheral is-chemia in patients with severe septic shock. In the future, prospect- ive studies are needed to suggest opinions for avoiding serious peripheral ischemia in vasopressor introduce.

Goal of study was to examine the causes of cognitive impairment after cardiopul- monary bypass.Methods: 84 consecutive, unselected patients undergoing CABG and/or valve procedures using CPB entered the study. Exclusion cri- teria included:recent stroke, high -grade carotid stenosis, chronic renal failure, hepatic insufficiency,aortic arch procedures, psychiatricdesease.All pts were administered a validated neurocognitive battery(Mini Mental State Examination, Visual Memory Test) preoperatively, postoperatively prior to discharge (5 -7 postoprtative day), and 3 months after operation. C-reactive protein (CRP) is also quantifiedfrom serum preoperatively, 6 h after operation and on hemodynamicaly stability, hypo- and normothermia, was assessed. T-test, Scheffe's test and ANOVA were used to demonstratestatistical significance. Results: The incidence of early POCD was 17.9 % (15/84). Mini Mental State Examination on discharge was si gnificantly impaired in this group compared with preoperative level (P = 0.023) especially in subtests such as orientation to time,attention, short-term memory, registration, exspressive speech. Visual memory te st failed to detect this cognitive impairment.But, 21.3%pts (18/84) showed cognitive improvement on discharge compared with preoperativ e level(p = 0.034).All pts with POCD were hemodinamicaly stab le, without excessive postoperative drainage, without prolonged mechanical ventila tion and infection. Baseline patient characteristics and key perioperative data were similar between patientswho developed early POCD compared with those who did not develop POCD (P = 0.372) . Pts with POCD had significantly elevated CRP at 6 h time point and on discharge compared with preoperative level (50.44 2.18;p Inflammatory stress is associated with POCD post CPB. Why some pts develop higher stress level leading to POCD is currently unknown.

A573 Changing attitudes towards primary therapeutic hypothermia intraumatic brain injury in the United Kingdom I. Uddin1, A.M. Belhaj2 1Princess Alexandra Hospital, Anaesthetics, Harlow, UK;2Southend University Hospital, Intensive Care, Essex, UKCorrespondence: I. Uddin - Princess Alexandra Hospital, Anaesthetics, Harlow, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A573 Introduction: Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability, particularly in the young(1). Traditionally, primary therapeutic hypothermia (PTH) was seen to be beneficial, and therehas been reported evidence of modest hypothermia as a neuropro-tectant that improved outcomes(2). However, most recent evidence revealed, when high quality trials were analysed, that the benefits of PTH on mortality and neurological outcome were lost(3). In addition,many studies have shown PTH to cause adverse effects(4).Objectives: Our aim was to assess how the use of PTH for TBI has evolved in the United Kingdom in light of recent evidence. Methods: We conducted a survey of 20 neuro-critical care units across the UK in 2010 and 2015. An electronic questionnaire examined localprotocols for PTH, triggers for commencing and discontinuation, target temperature ranges, use of muscle relaxants, cooling equipment, moni- toring and complications. A follow-up survey was conducted to assessfor a change in local guidelines in view of recent evidence.Results: In 2010, 90 % of the 20 neuro-critical care units had guide- lines for the management of TBI, 89 % of which included PTH as part of their management: 37 % targeted a temperature of 33-34 \u00b0C, 42 %targeted 34-35 \u00b0C, 16 % targeted 35-36 \u00b0C, while 5 % normothermia.Practice showed wide variation between units with regards to trig- gers for starting PTH (for ICP control: 85 % and all severe TBI: 15 %), stopping PTH (ICP target: 82 %, a set time limit: 18 %), cooling equip-ment (intravascular 38 %, convection methods 62 %), temperaturemonitoring (rectal, oesophageal and intravascular) use of muscle re- laxants (always with PTH 35 %, only with shivering 65 %), neuro- monitors (ICP and transcranial doppler are most common) and complications (immunoparesis and infection, cold diur-esis, dysrhythmias and electrolyte imbalance). The 2015 follow-up survey, in contrast, showed that all surveyed hospitals now have guidelines for the management of TBI,and that PTH is no longer partof these guidelines, with 100 % of responding hospitals now target-ing normothermia. Conclusions: The follow-up survey suggests that the use of PTH has fallen dramatically out of favour in UK neuro-critical care units since2010. Recent evidence casts doubt on the benefits and suggest thepossibility of harm.This has likely contributed to the trend of main- taining normal body temperature. References (1) Ghajar J.

Health, Budapest, Hungary;4Ankara University, Ankara, Turkey Correspondence: \u00c7. Kaymak - Ministry of Health, Ankara, Turkey Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A574 Introduction: Organ transplantation has become an important treat- ment option for patients with end-stage organ failure with the ad- vances in the technology and related medical sciences. It is very important to improve the health care professionals' knowledge and awareness on organ donation and transplantation along with the safety and quality of donor organs. Objectives: The main goal of the TNA Study was to identify weak points or 'gaps' in the professional's knowledge in organ donation and transplantation procedures in Turkey. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted via both quali- tative and quantitative research methods during April 2013-May 2014. The questionnaire was related to obstacles, strengths, weak- nesses and opportunities in the Turkish donor programme. The main purpose of the interview was to obtain in-depth insight into the training needs of Turkish transplant experts. A World Health Organization licensed Hennessy-Hicks training needs analysis questions (Hennessy, Hicks 2013) were incorporated in the assess- ment were used. Results: The questionnaire was disseminated randomly among 134 health personnel (50 doctors and 84 nurses) involved in Turkish donor programme. The analysis of the questionnaires revealed that the knowledge about brain death (BD) diagnostics was not good enough in the study population. Furthermore, the group of all re- spondents was not experienced in the brain death determination: 22 % of them have not determined BD yet, 30 % of respondents 1 -3 times, and only 20 % of respondents among doctors have deter- mined BD more that 10 times. In doctors group, only 69,6 % of re- spondents perceive it as biological death - the percentage should be higher indicating no doubts in the concept of BD. A big part (32 %) of respondents estimated their acquaintance with donation proce- dures and organization of the national donation programme as little; 26 % are somewhat acquainted and 13 % not at all. Regrettably, 20 % of all respondents (%12 of doctors) do not absolutely support organ donation. And 4 % would not accept an organ from a deceased donor if needed. Furthermore, the results of self-evaluation of communication knowledge, skills and experiences for the perform- ance of family interviews were too low: only 2 % of all respondents feel to have very much of knowledge, skills and experiences and20 % feel they have not at all enough knowledge or skills for per- forming the discussions. Conclusions: The results of the interviews revealed that lack of know- ledge, awareness, responsibility and positive attitude towards about BD diagnosis and organ donation process of medical staff and nurses. Finally, lack of knowledge, skills and experiences related to the communication with the family.

Lazaridis1,2 1Baylor College of Medicine, Neurology, Neurocritical Care, Houston, USA;2BCM, Center for Ethics, Houston, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A575 Introduction: There are currently over 120,000 people awaiting for a lifesaving organ transplant in the US with 22 patients per day dying on the waiting list.1An organ shortage is also the case for most Euro- pean countries. Furthermore, the demand is rising due to increasing burden of certain types of organ failure, and widening eligibility cri- teria for transplants. In regards to procurement policies the debate is often exhausted between opt-in and opt-out, and not enough atten- tion has been devoted to a \"non-opt \"policy. Such a policy, in the lit- erature, is better known as organ conscription.2, 3Conscription entails the routine procurement of organs from the dead, making consent and family veto irrelevant. The policy tends to be uncritically rejected as being an extreme utilitarian position that violates core deontological side-constraints such as autonomy and personal sovereignty. Objectives: To examine the permissibility of conscription via norma- tive ethics and formal justice analyses. Methods: Systematic review of the literature on the arguments for and against conscription to describe the current state of the debate. Subsequently and from a moral theory standpoint the policy is examined under the light of major normative theories such as consequentialism, deontology, and \"mixed \"views such as Parfit's triple theory. From a formal justice perspective, I em- ploy Rawls's liberal principle of legitimacy and Sen's capabilities approach. Results: There are three strands of arguments for and against conscription. These are based on normative ethics, justice and metaphysics. Contrary to main-stream views, conscription is not only defensible in consequentia list terms but obtains an even stronger force when examined under a deontological and mixed- theory lights, as well as formal justice theory. Potential conscrip- tion from patients who have been declared dead by neurologic criteria has been estimated to increase organ supply by many thousands per year. Conclusions: We ought to reconsider our procurement policy in order to face organ shortage in ways that are ethical, just and max- imally efficient. Organ conscription is such a policy. References 1.

Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A576 Introduction: Pain and anxiety are distressing for patients in inten- sive care units (ICUs) and effective pain and anxiety assessment and management are problematic in ICU settings. Existing research iden-tifying the level and trajectory of pain and anxiety patterns in ICU pa-tients during the first days of ICU treatment is limited, as is information on patients' needs regarding analgosedation. Objectives: To examine pain and anxiety patterns in ICU patients during the first three ICU days, and to identify patient preferencesfor analgosedation. Methods: A prospective study was performed in the University Hos- pital Interdisciplinary (medical-surgical) ICU. Pain was assessed everyfour hours during the first three ICU days. Pain intensity was mea-sured with a numeric rating scale (NRS), verbal rating scale (VRS), and behavioral assessment scale. Anxiety was assessed every 8 hours with either the NRS or VRS. Depth of sedation was measured using theRichmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). Patient preferences re-garding analgosedation were assessed one week following ICU dis- charge using semi-structured interviews. Descriptive analyses were performed to identify pain and anxiety patterns and patientpreferences.Results: The sample consisted of 141 ICU patients (mean age: 68.77). The majority (55 %) were treated for heart disease. Patients were treated in the ICU on average for 4.6 days. Pain medications adminis-tered in the first three days included fentanyl for 94 % of the pa-tients, propofol for 88 % of the patients, and midazolam for 44 % of the patients. Pain levels were relatively stable and consistent at a low intensity. Mean pain scores were highest on day 1 and slowly de-creased to reach the lowest levels on day 3. NRS scores: Day 1: 3.96(SD 3.58); Day 2: 3.84 (SD 2.79); Day 3: 2.37 (SD 1.74). Anxiety scores followed a similar pattern. Most of the patients were sleepy to lightly sedated (RASS: 1t o 2). The deepest sedation was found on the first ICU day. In general, 35 patients (25 %) experienced light sed-ation as helpful because it allowed them to comprehend what was happening. 17 patients (12 %) preferred moderate sedation and 89 patients (63 %) would rather have been deeply sedated so that theywould be protected from awareness of stressful or difficult situations.Rapid changes in levels of sedation was experienced as stressful, anx- iety provoking and disorienting. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that patients in an ICU do not experience high levels of pain or anxiety when they are only lightlysedated. Patients need continuous updates in information pertaining to their treatment to help cope with the uncertainties arising from changes in levels of sedation. A577 Multiprofessional team perspective in regards to early Galassi - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, S\u00e3o Paulo, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A577 Introduction: Early mobility is defined as any activity capable of pro- viding benefits to the patient from adequate positioning and passive movement to exercises and functional postures as orthostatism andambulation. For early mobility success it is necessary a multiprofes-sional team working.Objective: To collect multiprofessional team perspective in order to verify their involvement in early mobility process. Methods : During a three days period we performed small groups dy- namics with clinical examples to elucidate early mobility process. Atthe end, we evaluated the teams' perspective asking them to re- spond to one of each questions: 1) What do you consider important to the patient/family? 2) How can we contribute due to thisexperience?Results: 474 professionals were approached (cleaning assistant, nurs- ing assistant, nurses, speech therapists, physiotherapists, and clini- cians). 155 professionals (33 %) chose to answer the first question.The most frequent responses were: learn to listen (11 %), put yourselfin the others point of view (10 %), team work (6 %), care with respect and love as if your own family member (6 %). The other 319 profes- sional (67 %) chose to answer the second question. We separatedthe answers in regards to attitude, consequence and feeling of thisexperience. Attitude: motivation (13 %), willpower (105), commitment (7 %), focus (7 %), attention (6 %). Consequence: dedication (17 %), safeness (14 %), humanization (14 %), communication (105). Feelings:empathy (12 %), affection (11 %), love (10 %), fulfillment (9 %), pa-tience (8 %), understanding (7 %). Conclusion: There is an emotional involvement of health care profes- sional due to patients' assistance performance incentive.

A578 Therapeutic hypothermia in ICU: results from a cross sectionalstudy from a private ICU in Brazil M. S\u00e3o BrazilCorrespondence: M. Lobato - Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A578 Introduction: Therapeutic hypothermia is indicated hypertension [1] and post cardiac arrest [2]. It may have effects on controlling secondary brain injury, which may occur after traumatic brain injury or brain ischemia.Objectives: To describe clinical and epidemiological profile of pa- tients submitted to therapeutic hypothermia in a private ICU in Brazil. Methods: Design. Cross sectional. Period and setting: January 2012 to January 2015 in a 41-bed ICU from a tertiary private hospital inSao Paulo, Brazil. We included all ICU adult patients (age >18 years) submitted to therapeutic hypothermia for any reason during the period of study. Trained personnel retrospectively collected data re-garding demographic data, such as age, hospital admission diagno-sis, comorbidities, mechanical ventilation, vasopressors, laboratory parameters, therapeutic hypothermia indication, method of cooling, hypothermia duration and maintenance, target temperature, andcomplications. Therapeutic hypothermia indication and managementwas in accordance with international society guidelines. Results: A total of 39 patients were submitted to therapeutic hypothermia during the study period. Most of the patients were male(23/39). About 1/3 of the patients were between 62 -72 years. Hyper- tension (20/39), diabetes (12/39) and hypothyroidism (7/39) were the most prevalent comorbid conditions. Post cardiac arrest was the major indication for therapeutic hypothermia (16/39) followed bytraumatic brain injury with refractory intracranial hypertension (6/39).All patients were induced with cooling blanket and 97,4 % (38/39) with ice in inguinal and axillary regions. Gavage was used in 48,7 % (19/39) and 4 \u00b0C saline infused in 41 % (16/39). Mean target coolingtemperature was achieved in 2.2 (\u00b11.6) hours and mean rewarmingtime was 20.7 (\u00b18.2) hours. The two most frequent hypothermiaIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 298 of 607complications were ventricular arrhythmias (10.3 %) and bleeding (thoracic, intra-abdominal or thoracic) (7.7 %). For those patients whose indication was hypothermia after post cardiac arrest (n = 25),the distribution of cardiac arrest rhythms was PEA (11/25), VT (10/25),and asystole (4/25). Intra-hospital arrest was slightly more prevalent (13/25) than extra-hospital. The mean CPR time was 20.9 (24.4) mi- nutes. For this cohort of patients, intra-hospital mortality was10.26 % (4/39).Conclusions: In our cohort of patients, therapeutic hypothermia was mostly indicated for post cardiac arrest patients with appropriate management and low mortality and complication rates.

Erasme University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Department of Intensive Care, Brussels, Belgium Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A579 Introduction: Bed rest, sedation and immobilization are unavoidable during the first days of treatment with Extra-Corporeal MembraneOxygenation (ECMO), especially when cannulas are inserted throughthe femoral vessels. The effects of immobilization of the hip on later joint mobility on the side of a femoral cannula are unknown. Objectives: To compare the range of motion (ROM) of immobilized joints to that of the other joints, which were passively mobilized.Methods: All patients requiring veno-venous or veno-arterial ECMO with one femoral cannula in situ were included. Joints not affected by ECMO were mobilized every day and evaluated by goniometryevery 3 days until ECMO withdrawal. After ECMO withdrawal, alljoints were mobilized daily and evaluated every 3 days until ICU dis- charge. ROM was compared before and after mobilization (Student's t test) and in immobilized and mobilized joints (ANOVA).Results: Ten patients (age 49 \u00b1 15 years, 8 male, ICU mortality 40 %) with veno-venous (n = 5) or veno-arterial (n = 5) ECMO were included. Passive mobilization was well tolerated by all patients. The duration of sedation and ECMO was 6 \u00b1 3 days. ROM was assessed until day21 \u00b1 13.Hip and knee ROM increased over time from the day ofECMO withdrawal to the day of ICU discharge (by 24 % for hips [p < 0.01] and by 17 % for knees [p < 0.01]) on both sides. Conclusions: The results of this pilot study suggest that immobilization of a joint because of the presence of an ECMO can-nula does not result in functional impairment.

Objectives: To describe the end of the life care practices in patients suffering from severe non-reversible brain injury in order to evaluatetheir suitability as potential organ donors and to introduce a path- way for their identification and transformation into real donors. Methods: Multicentre, observational and prospective study (ACCORD project) in Spanish hospitals.Two period study: - First period (data collection): review of all the deceased patients in our hospital due to severe non- reversible brain injury and identifica-tion of potential organ donors.- Second (intervention period): creation of a pathway to overcome obstacles for the identification of potentials donors and convert them into real donors.Results: During the data collection phase we identified 24 patients with severe non-reversible brain injury. Thirteen of them (52.4 %) were males and 6 (25 %) were between 60 and 69 years old. The principal cause of death was stroke (haemorrhagic or ischemic). Fif-teen patients (62.5 %) were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU)and the other nine (37,5 %) were not considerer by their primary care team as subsidiary of ICU care or as potential donors. Of the 13 patients admitted to the ICU, six died in brain dead andnine after circulatory dead. Four of the deceased patients in braindead were real donors and five in the circulatory death group [37,5 % (n = 9) absolute donation rate]. Of the nine patients not admitted, only one had medical contraindi-cations for donation (33,3 % of potential donors).In order to prepare for the intervention period, the data were ana- lysed and shared with the different medical teams involved in the care of these patients and an algorithm was elaborated in order toidentify the potential donors. Recollection of data for this secondperiod is now underway. Conclusions: Hospitalized patients with severe non-reversible brain injury could contribute to the increase in the number of real donors.Programs aimed to spread the knowledge regarding the role of thesepatients as potential donors, and the creations of pathways and pro- tocols to activate the transplant coordination team could be funda- mental to increase the number of available organs.Table 33 (abstract A579).

Rold\u00e1n 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A581 Introduction: In recent years there have been major advances in renal transplantation, including postoperative management, reflectedin decreased in-hospital mortality. However, it remains a complexprocedure in a group of patients with high comorbidity. Acute graft failure is one of the most common complications, increased in recent years due to non-heart beating donors (NHBD). Bedside ultrasoundand radioisotope imaging tests are routinely used during postopera-tive management in ICU. Objectives: To analyze the concordance of renal doppler ultrasound (RDU) performed at bedside and radioisotopes tests after renal trans-plantation. Evaluate delayment in renal function in NHBD.Methods: Retrospective, observational study from 2013 to 2014. In- clusion criteria: patients admitted in the ICU in the postoperative of renal transplantation. Variables: Demographic information, type ofdonation, analytical values, diuresis and bleeding during the ICU stay,results of the imaging tests (ultrasound resistance index less than 0.7 and good perfusion in scintigraphy), transfusion, creatinine levels at discharge, days of hospitalization in the ICU and mortality. Descrip-tive statistical analysis using U of Mann -Whitney test for differences between groups and Kappa test for the agreement between flow tests. Results: 172 patients were included in our study. 62 % were male. The median age was 52 (RI 41 -61) years old. Characteristics of the patients are shown in Table 34. The median time of ICU stay was 1 day (RI 1 -2). No deaths were registered. Agreement between im- aging tests reached a Kappa Index of 0.5 (p < 0.001) (Table 35). Conclusions: Kidney transplantation postoperative has a short length of stay at the ICU. Renal grafts from un-controlled NHBD showed a delay in the im- provement of kidney function compared with other types of donors.A medium agreement between RDU and scintigraphy was observed.

Young2 1Queen Alexandra Hospital, Critical Care, Portsmouth, UK;2Sheffield Hallam University, Faculty of Health & Wellbeing, Sheffield, UK Correspondence: S. Calvert - Queen Alexandra Hospital, Critical Care, Portsmouth, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A582 Introduction: Survival following critical illness is improving and the focus is moving towards optimisation of recovery. However, rehabilita-tion is poorly understood and national guidance recommends the need for information to be delivered to patients and their carers in an appro- priate way (NICE CG83, 2009). In order to demonstrate adherence to na-tional guidance and improve the patients' and their carers' awarenessabout rehabilitation in the acute phase of recovery following critical ill- ness, this project aimed to develop, implement and evaluate an infor- mation booklet on rehabilitation after critical illness.Objectives: To evaluate the impact of introducing an information booklet on compliance with CG83 standards. Methods: A three stage approach was used. Firstly, current evidence was critiqued to identify the important and required informationalneeds. This information was then used to design and develop the in-formation booklet by the author. This was then introduced and eval- uated for a period of 8 weeks. Compliance with NICE CG83 was analysed using the guideline specific audit tool. A locally producedservice evaluation questionnaire and a booklet feedback form wereused to generate qualitative and quantitative outcomes. Results: Over the evaluation period the booklet was issued on n = 29 occasions, with n = 13 completing analysis. Following the implementa-tion of the booklet, compliance with NICE guidance (see Table 36)i m - proved from 0 % to 100 %. Improvements were made in all but two areas of the service evaluation questionnaire. Out of 53 feedback com- ments received, 45 were positive.Conclusions: Production of the critical illness information booklet was an effective method in meeting national guidelines forTable 34 (abstract A581).

Shevill - Royal Surrey County Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, Department of Anaesthesia, Guildford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A583 Introduction: 11,000 inter-hospital transfers of critically ill patients are carried out each year (1). These transfers carry a significant risk; technical complications occur in up to 36 % of inter-hospital transfers (2). Recommended guidelines are available from the Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland (AAGBI) and the Intensive Care Society (ICS). Objectives: The department's existing system and equipment for transfers were perceived to be inadequate. This project was to assess the current system and implement any necessary change. Methods: The contents of three existing bags were audited to assess uniformity. Users' perception and experience of the bags were audited. The results were poor. Following this, a standardised kit list and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), compliant with ICS guide- lines (3), were agreed by all members of the anaesthetic, theatre and ICU departments. New bags and protocols were introduced. Users' perception of the bags was then re-audited. Results: The audit of the old bags showed that only 27 % of items were present in all 3 bags, that there was no standardised kit list, and that some items were out of date. Overall rating of the bags increased from 3.5 to 8.4 following the introduction of these changes. Conclusions: Introduction of a standardised kit list and a robust sys- tem for checking the bags has improved consistency, safety and user satisfaction. Following further use, the kit list will be reviewed andrevised as necessary. Consideration should be given to the Surrey Critical Care Network adopting these bags and procedures. References 1.

Isotti - IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Milan, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A584 Introduction: Delirium and Intensive Care Unit Acquired Weakness are two of the most common sequelae in patients recovered in In- tensive Care Unit (ICU) [1,2]. The ABCDE bundle (Awakening and Breathing trials, Choice of sedative and analgesics, Delirium monitor-ing and Early mobility) is a multicomponent approach effective inpreventing these complications [4]. Despite a large amount of litera- ture about the ABCDE bundle is available, a previous attempt of im- plementation in an Italian environment has never been reported.Objectives: The aim of this study was to implement the ABCDE bun- dle in a general ICU of a large university hospital in northern Italy. Methods: A multidisciplinary team, consisting of critical care physi- cians and nurses, reviewed the literature and developed a protocoltailored on the Italian environment. Before the ABCDE bundle waspart of the routine practice, education of nurses and physicians has been provided through meetings, reminders and poster that summa- rized the key steps of the protocol was posted by the patients\u00b4 bed-side. After the ABCDE bundle was part of the routine practice aquality improvement (QI) program to strengthen the bundle know- ledge has been realized: every nurse and physician attended a train- ing course while data about facilitators and obstacles to the bundleimplementation was collected. Data about adherence to the protocolhas been collected to evaluate the effect of QI program. Results: The ABCDE bundle has been implemented in November 2014. The Early mobility protocol became standard care from March2015. During the QI program, some hindering factors to the imple-mentation were identified, such as communication issues between team members, lack of resources and low confidence with the proto- col. In the first quarter post-implementation 27 % of total patientswere mobilized, in the second quarter post-implementation 67 % oftotal patients were mobilized dangling or out-of-bed. Adverse events related to the bundle were not observed. A year after the initial im- plementation, the \"F\"phase has begun to be incorporated into everyday practice, with a wider opening hours to relatives and a pro-ject of live musicians. Conclusions: Although there is no available data about a previous implementation of the ABCDE bundle in an Italian setting, our experi-ence demonstrate that it is feasible and safe. Further efforts areneeded to spread the knowledge of the ABCDE bundle and improve adherence to protocol. References 1. Mehta S, Cook D, Devlin JW, Skrobik Y, Meade M, Fergusson D, et al.

Frencken - University Medical Center Utrecht, Julius Center for Health Sciences and Primary Care, Utrecht, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A585 Introduction: Myocardial injury, as reflected by elevated plasma car- diac troponin levels, has repeatedly been reported in patients withcommunity-acquired pneumonia (CAP), but its temporal dynamicshave not been systematically studied. Furthermore, although tropo- nin release has been associated with increased mortality, its etiology still remains unknown.Objectives: Our aim was to determine the incidence of troponin re- lease in CAP patients and provide a detailed description of the clin- ical and pathophysiological setting during which it occurs. Methods: We enrolled consecutive patients admitted with CAP to the intensive care units (ICU) of two tertiary care centers in theNetherlands between January 2011 and May 2015. Patients trans- ferred from another hospital, patients after cardiac arrest, and pa- tients not meeting criteria for organ failure were excluded. High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI, Abbott ARCHITECT STAT HighSensitive Troponin-I) was measured daily during the first week. ICU days were categorized into days with troponin release (days followed by a 40 % increase in hs-cTnI on the next day and an absolute rise>26 ng/L), days without troponin release (days followed by a >40 %and >26 ng/L decrease in hs-cTnI, or a value beneath the upper ref- erence limit (URL) of 26 ng/L), and days with possible troponin re- lease (if fulfilling none of these conditions).Results: Among 200 patients with CAP we analyzed 179 subjects, yield- ing 709 classifiable ICU days. Median age was 63 (IQR 50 -73) years, 113 (63 %) were males, and the median APACHE IV score was 83 (IQR 68 - 106). Troponin release above the URL occurred in 145 (81 %) individ-uals and peaked at a median of 136 ng/L (IQR 32 -771). Patients with troponin release had more (Charlson score 6.4 vs. 2.5 me- dian, p-value 0.06), longer ICU stays (8.3 vs. 5.4 days, p-value 0.02), and higher hospital mortality (30 % vs. 15 %, p-value 0.06) than those with-out. Of the 709 observation days, 72 were classified as definite, 208 aspossible, and 429 as no troponin release. Troponin release most fre- quently occurred on day 1 (32 %) with the majority (65 %) occurring before day 3. Inflammation and coagulation factors (fever, reducedplatelet count, increased prothrombin time), as well as supply -demandIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 302 of 607mismatch factors (hypotension, high shock index, noradrenalin use, and respiratory failure) were increasingly prevalent on days with tropo- nin release (Table 37). Furthermore, several extrinsic factors (e.g., acute kidney injury and cardiotoxic medication use) were also associated withtroponin release. Conclusions: Troponin release occurs in a majority of CAP patients. Increased myocardial workload (resulting in supply -demand mis- match) and an activated coagulation system could be potentialcauses of this injury.

A586 Evolution & impact of thrombocytopenia in septic C.E. Menard 1, Winnipeg, Canada;2University of Manitoba, Critical Care, Winnipeg, Canada;3University of City, Canada Correspondence: C.E. Menard - University of Manitoba, Internal Medicine, Winnipeg, Canada Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A586Introduction: Thrombocytopenia in patients with septic shock is common, occurring in 20-58 % of patients. While previous investiga- tions have correlated platelet nadir to adverse outcomes, the timecourse describing both the evolution and recovery ofthrombocytopenia in septic shock have not been well defined. Objectives: (1) To characterize the evolution of thrombocytopenia in patients di-agnosed with septic shock, and(2) to investigate the independent association of thrombocytopenia and clinically relevant patient outcomes. Methods: Retrospective propensity-matched cohort study of adults patients with septic shock who were admitted to an intensive careunit (ICU) in one of two tertiary care hospitals in Winnipeg, Canada between 2007 and 2012. Data for this study was obtained from the Co-operative Antimicrobial Therapy of Septic Shock (CATSS) databasewhich was further linked to the Winnipeg Regional Health AuthorityCritical care database and the Laboratory Information System. The time course of incident (new) thrombocytopenia was described rela- tive to vasopressor requirements. Clinical outcomes of thrombocyto-penic patients were compared to non-thrombocytopenic propensity-matched patients. Results: Of 980 patients, 165 (16.8 %) had thrombocytopenia at ICU admission; 271 (27.7 %) developed thrombocytopenia in theICU. The median time from admission to thrombocytopenia was2 days (interquartile range [IQR] 1 -3). Among survivors, the me- dian time from incident thrombocytopenia to platelet recovery was 6 days (IQR 4 -8). The average platelet nadir was 62 (SD 24.6) in survivors, versus 52 (SD 26.3) in non-survivors (p = 0.003).Platelet recovery lagged behind clinical recovery. The median time from vasopressor independence to platelet recovery was 2d a y s( I Q R0 -4). Thrombocytopenia was not significantly associ- ated with hospital mortality (OR 1.17; 95 % CI 0.81-1.69), but wasassociated with ICU length of stay (9 vs. 6 days; p < 0.01), dur- ation of ventilation (7 versus 4 days; p < 0.01), duration of vaso- pressor use (4 versus 3; p < 0.01), major bleeding events (41.2 %vs. 17.6 %; OR 3.28), red blood cell transfusions (2 vs. 0; p < 0.01),and renal replacement therapy (69 % vs 40 %; OR 2.00). Conclusion: Thrombocytopenia occurs early in the development of sepsis. In septic shock, platelet recovery lags behind clinical re-covery. Thrombocytopenia is independently associated with a lon-ger duration of vasopressor and ventilator support and increased major bleeding events, but may not be associated with increased mortality.

Spectral indices were computed via autoregressive model as very low (VLF: 0 -0.04Hz), (BRS) was and transfer function methods. Wilcoxon Rank-sum and Friedman tests were used to assess differences between groups in each day and differences within the same group over the 3 days, respectively. Significance is for p < 0.05.Results: There were no significant differences between groups in demographic characteristics or comorbidities. For the HP series, there was a significant increasing trend in total power from day 1 to 3 in the R group (p = 0.0249); LF% also increased in the R group only (p =0.0125). Mean DAP values increased significantly in the R group fromday 1 to 3 (p < 0.01). LF power (mmHg 2), LF% and LF/HF in the DAP series increased significantly in the R group (p = 0.0183, p < 0.01 and p = 0,0498 respectively). In the 2ndand 3rdICU days LF power (mmHg2), and LF% were higher in R compared NR patients (p = 0.0394 and p = 0.0476 respectively). There were no significant differ- ences in the SAP series. Baroreflex indices showed an increasing trend in both groups without statistically significant results.Conclusions: Variability of HR significantly increased in SS patients pre- senting organ function improvement over the first 3 ICU days. This may be driven by increased sympathetic autonomic activity. The mean value of DAP, considered to reflect vascular resistance driven by sympatheticvasomotor tone, raised only in the Recovery group. The ability to in-crease DAP could be a sign of responsiveness to vasoconstrictors. Inter- estingly SAP was not different between the 2 groups; this could be due to the fact that it is used as target for therapy. Further investigationsare required to find specific associations with drug dosage, namelysymphatotonic drugs, and clinically relevant outcomes.

Nunes - Hospital Dr. N\u00e9lio Mendon\u00e7a, Intensive Care, Funchal, Portugal Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A588 Introduction: Mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock is predicted independently by a variety of factors, such as, hyperbilirubinemia,since there is evidence that it can induce inflammation, and apop- tosis.1-3However, animal data suggested that bilirubin has antioxi- dant properties that might be cytoprotective.1,3To date, evidence of the discriminative power of bilirubin on survival due to its allegedantioxidant effects are lacking. Objectives: We hypothesized that milder elevations of bilirubin might be protective and associated to better outcomes. Our second-ary outcome is to identify a level of bilirubin with discriminativepower either for survival or mortality. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective study using our unit database, collecting data from 2008 to 2015, including pa-tients >18 years-old, meeting the criteria for severe sepsis and septicshock according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference. 4We identified the highest serum bilirubin levels within 72 hours of ICU admission andthen stratified into 4 cohorts based on hepatic SOFA cut-off values.SOFA and APACHE II scores were recorded. Results: We analyzed 642 patients. The highest bilirubin level was 25,1 mg/dL. Stratifying in the four cohorts, we found a significant de-crease in survival from a bilirubin 1,2 (OR from 2 to 7,2 (p < 0,001)) with the highest impact from moderate increases (Wald score of 26) (graphic 1). Patients with >11,9 mg/dL had a mean survival of 3 days. There was also a significant difference in severity scores, renal func-tion, liver enzymes and lactate values between the groups, whichwas analyzed in a Logistic regression. There was no significant differ- ence for UCI-days and length of mechanical ventilation. Discussion: We found hyperbilirubinemia to be independently asso- ciated with increased risk of death but no difference in other out-comes, in this population. Despite a lower mortality rate, moderate elevations were not protective but were found to have a higher pre- dictive weight to ICU mortality. We ponder if the protective role ofmild elevations, might be true only for patients with hyperbilirubine-mia over a much longer time frame that critical patients, which should be studied in future prospective studies. Conclusion: Elevated bilirubin levels in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock were significantly associated with an increased riskof ICU mortality, but not longer ICU stay and length of mechanical ventilation. The protective role of the stress-induced rise of bilirubin in septic shock, was not proven.

Coronado Robles, M.A. Montes Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A589 Introduction: While the prevalence of euthyroid sick syndrome is known, which is present in approximately 60 % to 70 % of septic pa- tients in an ICU unit, there is little information on their correlation with other clinical severity variables.Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of euthyroid sick syndrome and correlate the findings of thyroid hormone profile with clinical se- verity variables. Methods: During the period of March 2014 to February 2016, in an ICU unit ABC Medical Center in Mexico, were documented clinicaland paraclinical findings including a thyroid hormone profile in sep- tic patients of any etiology and severity criteria collected based on the scale of SOFA (sequential organ failure assessment).Results: 51 patients were included with a mean age of 68 \u00b1 15.6 years, 47 % females and 52.9 % males. BMI of 24.1 \u00b1 4.3 kg/m2. The median ICU stay was 7 days (IQR 4 -13) and post ICU stay of 1 (IQR 0 -5). Invasive and non-invasive mechanical ventilation in 23.5 and 29.4 %, respectively. The overall mortality rate was 31.4 %. TheSOFA average was patients with a history of dia- betes, cardiovascular and thyroid disease was 29.4, 64.7 and 21.6 %,respectively. The overall prevalence of euthyroid sick syndrome was80.4 % (95 % CI 0.69 to 0.91 %). The correlations between thyroid hormone profile and clinical severity variables were: for T4T with Glasgow Coma Scale r = 0.33, (p = 0.017); for FT3 with days of hos-pital stay r = 0.8, (p = 0.028), T4T with SOFA r = 0.28, (p = 0.047); TSH with SOFA r = 0.3, (p = 0.031); FT4 with creatinine r = 0.4, (p = 0.018). Total protein with FT3 and T4T with r = 0.3, (p = 0.034) and r = 0.308, (p = 0.029), respectively. PCR with FT3 r = 0.84, (p = 0.017). The groupof patients with euthyroid sick syndrome spent more days in the ICU8 (IQR 4 -16) vs 5 (IQR 3 -7), without reaching statistical significance (p = 0.06). Conclusions: We analyzed abnormalities in thyroid function tests and severity scales in septic patients in an intensive care unit, whereIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 304 of 607prevalence of euthyroid sick syndrome was 80.4 %. A lower value of TSH and T4T correlated with the severity of patients. A lower Glas- gow Coma Scale correlated with lower value of T4T.

The patho-physiology of SAE is incompletely elucidated. It has been hypothe- sized that impairment of cerebral autoregulation (CAR) would result in brain hypoperfusion and neuronal damage (1), but previous stud-ies showed conflicting results (2,3).Objectives: The aim of the study is to evaluate CAR in septic shock patients and test the hypothesis that its alteration is associated with clinical encephalopathy or brain perfusion.Methods: Adult patients diagnosed with septic shock and admitted to the ICU stay were included (July 2015 - March 2016). Exclusion cerebral artery(LMCA) with a 2-MHz probe. LMCA blood flow velocity (FV) and arter- ial blood pressure (BP) signals were simultaneously recorded; Pear- son\u00b4s correlation MATLAB (MathWorks, USA). Impaired CAR was defined asMxa > 0.3 (4). Results: 24 patients were included; median norepinephrine dose was 0.3 [0.13-0.66] mcg/kg/min. Site of infection was pul-monary was 71 [62 -73]% at time of TCD assessment. Eight patients (33 %) received sedation during examination.Median Mxa was 0.26 [ 0.06-0.6] and CAR was impaired in 11 pa- tients (46 %). No difference in Mxa was observed between se- dated and non-sedated patients (p = 0.3), PaCO2 level < vs 40 mmHg (p = 0.9) and presence of encephalopathy (e.g. GCS <15 on admission) (p = 0.5). Also, no association between Mxa andmean BP or dose of vasopressors was noted. Conclusions: CAR was altered in almost half of the patients with sep- tic shock. No association between autoregulation and clinical en-cephalopathy or determinants of brain perfusion was found(Table 38). et al.Impaired autoregulation in patients with severe sepsis and sepsis-associated delirium.Crit Care 2012;16:R181 3.

Chaari - King Hamad University Hospital, Intensive Care, Muharaq, Bahrain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A592 Introduction: Septic shock is a life threatening condition associated with high mortality. Poor outcome is mainly related to the inad- equacy between oxygen delivery and cellular demand leading to the onset of multiorgan dysfunction. Whether this multiorgan failureaffect the pancreas is not fully investigated [1].Objective: To assess the prognostic value of increased pancreatic en- zymes in patients with septic shock. Methods: We conducted a prospective study in a 12-bed medical surgical intensive care unit. All patients admitted with septic shockwere included. Demographic, clinical and biological data were re- corded on admission. Serum amylase and lipase levels were checked on day 1 and day 2. All the patients with increased amylase and/orlipase serum level underwent imaging investigations. Quantitativevariables were expressed as median [quartiles] and qualitative vari- ables were expressed as percentages. Quantitative variables were compared by Mann -Whitney test and qualitative variables were com- pared by Chi2 or Fisher exact test as appropriate.Results: Thirty patients were included in our study. Median [quartile] age was 68 [58 -81] years. Sex-ratio (M/F) was 1.7. Median [quartile] APACHE II score was 26.5 [19.8-32]. The cause of septic shock waspneumonia in 14 patients (46.7 %), urinary tract infection in 4 pa-tients (13.3 %), necrotizing fasciitis in 7 patients (23.3 %) and intra- abdominal sepsis in 5 patients (16.7 %). Median [quartile] serum amylase was 44.3 [25.6-76.4] UI/L on serum lipase was and 142 [73 -261] UI/L on day 2. Twelve patients (40 %) had in- creased amylase level and seven patients (23.3 %) had increased lip- ase level. All these patients underwent imaging tests: Three patients(10 %) had abdominal computed tomography and 9 patients (30)had abdominal ultrasonography. Only one patient (3.3 %) had radio- logical evidence of acute pancreatitis. Median [quartile] length of in- tensive care unit stay was 6 [3 -11] Days. 28-day mortality was 36.7 %. There was no significant difference between survivors anddeaths regarding the highest serum lipase and amylase levels re- corded during the first 48 hours (respectively 90 [22 -153] versus 46 [31-201]; p = 0.914 and -295]; p = 0.197). Non-survivors at 28-day had higher II score (28 [27 - 32] versus 21[19 -29]; p = 0.024) and required mechanical ventilation more frequently (100 % versus 42.1 %; p = 0.002). Conclusion: The increase of pancreatic enzyme is common in pa- tients with septic shock. However, pancreatic injury does not affectthe prognosis of these patients. References 1.

We exam- ined some factors of the patients with sepsis.Objectives: We searched the worse factor of the prognosis of septic patients. Methods: This study was a retrospective observational study in a sin- gle center.We studied the patients with sepsis who admitted from the emer-gency department to the ICU in our hospital. We defined sepsis as patients with SOFA score 2 points worse than sepsis onset before (Sepsis-3 Definition) (3).The study period was from Jan. 2014 to Jun. 2015.Gender, age, APACHE2, SOFA, and KDIGO classification of AKI were checked. Results: The number of patients was 60: non-survivor 18(30 %), and survivor 42(70 %).Table 39showed the characteristics of each group. Table 40showed the correlation between KDIGO classification and the prognosis. As APACHE2, SOFA, and KDIGO classification of AKI were bad, lifeprognosis was bad.Among SOFA score, renal function and respiratory function were well correlated with patients mortality. Conclusions: The acute kidney injury and acute respiratory failure were especially worse prognostic factor among septic patients.

However, the use of ROTEM\u00aefor the management of SS has not been validated,yet. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of ROTEM\u00aeas a diagnostic and prognostic tool in SS.In particular,we assessed its ability to identify critically ill-patients at high risk of DIC. Methods: 21patients(43%M,57%F)admitted to our ICU with a diag- nosis of SS[2] were enrolled.Exclusion criteria were:end-stage heart 18y, pre-existent hematological disorders,ongoing anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy. 21 healthy volunteers, age and sex matched, were recruited to establish references values for ROTEM\u00aeparameters.ROTEM\u00aeassays were performed at the time of ICU admission(baseline) and 24 h later(day1). ROTEM\u00ae(Tem International GmbH, M\u00fcnchen, Germany) was performed according to manufacturers'recommendations. The DIC-score, calculated according to the International Society for Thrombosis and Haemostasis, was determined over the first 24 h and 28-day mortality was recorded. Data were expressed as medians, IQR or percentages. T-test was used for comparison between groups. ROC curves and the correspondent AUC were used to assess visco- elastic parameters as diagnostic biomarkers of SS and DIC. Results: In SS EXTEM-clotting time(CT) wa s significantly longer both at baseline and day 1[81.79 s(IQR64-88) and 73s(IQR66-77), respectively], compared to controls[60s(IQR45-64 ),p < 0.01)]. Furthermore, EXTEM-CT showed a great ability to identify septic patients(CT:AUC > 0.83,p < 0.01). No differences were noticed between survivors and non-survivors. ISTH- score for DIC was 5 in 24 % of patients, and their MCF in INTEM, EXTEM and FIBTEM was strongly reduc no-DIC:48 (IQR47- 52) vs 68 mm (IQR65-73), 49 mm (IQR49-49) vs 69 mm (IQR66-74) and 7 mm (IQR4-11) vs 30 mm (IQR20-38) resp ectively, p < 0.05). The relative ROC-curves showed that MCF could be a valid biomarker for diagnosis of DIC(AUC > 0.95,p < 0.01 in INTEM, EXTEM, FIBTEM). Conclusion: Our preliminary findings suggest that ROTEM\u00aecould be a valid tool for diagnosis of coagulopathy in SS.EXTEM-CT measurement underlined a severe impairment in the extrinsic coagulation pathway.MCF in INTEM,EXTEM and FIBTEM seemed to be useful bio- markers for the diagnosis of DIC.In conclusion,ROTEM\u00aemight have an additional value to identify coagulopathy in SS.

Souza - Federal University of S\u00e3o Paulo, Morphology and Genetics, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A595 Hepatic dysfunction represents a common manifestation during the sepsis process, involving portal inflammation, centrilobular necrosis, lobular microcircula- tion injuries are causative factors among other multiple factors leading to the hepatic dysfunction in sepsis. However, how much of the liver dysfunction is recovered after discharge from hospital is still little known. Herein we evaluated the impact of sepsis on liver struc- tures in sepsis survivals.Methods: Adult Wistar rats (200 g) (n = 12) were submitted to sepsis [iv. 2 mL E. coli 109CFU/ mL (S9), DL80 in 26 hours]. After 2 h, 6 h, 24 h and 30 days, (T2h, T6h, T24h and T30d), the animals were sacri- ficed, and samples of liver were collected and stained with H&E, PAS and Sudan-Black. The T30d animals were considered survivors since the mortality of sepsis S9 is 80 % from 26 hours after induction Results: The histological results show that S-9 sepsis model deter- mines a rapid and progressive liver damage. In the period of T2h, al- though predominant hepatic aspect of normality was observed, there was the onset of a sinusoidal congestion of focal occurrence, presence of polymorphonuclear cells in the lumen of the vein hep- atic centrilobular and by PAS staining was observed the ac- cumulation in cytoplasm of hepatocytes, except around centrilobular vein. At T6H, there was a generalized sinusoidal congestion, signifi- cant polymorphonuclear cells infiltration in the portal area and pres- ence of leukocytes adhering to the endothelium of the centrilobular vein. Besides, was also observed some hepatocytes with shrunken nucleus suggesting apoptotic cell death in progress. PAS showed a overall decrease of glycogen in hepatocytes, suggesting a high con- sumption of energy due to the exacerbated inflammatory process of sepsis. Twenty four hours post sepsis, the liver was congested, mainly in centrilobular veins, suggestive of increased vascular resistance in the liver. The infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, predominantly in centrilobular and periportal areas suggested the leucocyte inva- sion into the liver parenchyma and subsequent proinflammatory re- action. PAS staining showed the presence of multiple small vesicles inside the hepatocytes, suggestive of initial degenerative process in progress and this proved to be fat vesicles by Sudan Black staining. In 30 days after sepsis recovery, the sinusoidal spaces were com- pressed and some congestions were located in the centrilobular vein, moreover, there were liver cell degeneration with pycnosis and hya- line degeneration, suggesting a chronic phase of liver dysfunction. The overall findings demonstrated a multiple liver parenchymal ab- normalities in post-sepsis period, suggesting the fragility of the liver physiology to fight against a new infectious challenge.

Hanslin - Uppsala University, Department of Surgical Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A596 Introduction: The splanchnic reticulo-endothelial system is funda- mentally involved in bacterial clearance both via innate and adaptive immune responses. It has e.g. been reported that hyposplenism is Fig. 64 (abstract A595). Kinetics of hepatic lesions of the acute phase (T2h-T24h) and post-sepsis recovery (T30d)Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 307 of 607associated with an unfavorable outcome in sepsis. We hypothesized that systemic inflammatory response (SIR) induced immunosuppres- sion leads to decreased trans-splanchnic microbial clearance. Objectives: To investigate if pre-existing systemic inflammation af- fects the splanchnic bacterial clearance. Methods: Fifteen anesthetized pigs were subjected to an infusion of E. coli in a cervical vein for 3 hours. To induce a systemic inflamma- tory response, group \"EtxPreExp \"(n = 6) received a continuous intra- venous endotoxin infusion starting 24 h prior to the E. coli infusion. Group \"UnExp \"(n = 6) received the bacterial infusion without prior endotoxin exposure. To understand the effects of 24 h anesthesia alone, three animals received saline instead of endotoxin for 24 h prior to the bacterial infusion ( \"Controls \"). According to the predefined statis- tical plan, \"Controls \"were not included in the primary analysis. Bacterial counts in arterial and portal venous blood were analyzed hourly during theE. coli infusion, and were corrected for the bacterial dose adminis- tered per body weight. Blood samples were analyzed and physiologic parameters were recorded throughout the experiment. Results: All animals receiving endotoxin developed SIR prior to the E. coliinfusion. The amounts of administered bacteria were comparable between the groups. There were no differences between EtxPreExp and UnExp groups in log (\u00b10.36) vs. 2.11 (\u00b10.77)) bacterial counts at 3 h, just before the end of the bacterial infusion. Further- more, there was no difference in the ratio of portal vein to arterial bacterial counts between the EtxPreExp and UnExp groups (Fig. 65). White blood cell counts (p < 0.001), mean arterial pressure (p < 0.01), base excess (p < 0.05) and pH (p < 0.001) were lower, while arterial lac- tate levels (p < 0.001) were higher in UnExp vs. EtxPreExp group during and after the E. coli infusion. Conclusions: Our preliminary results show that despite diminished immunologic and physiologic response, induced by pre-existing in- flammatory response, the splanchnic bacterial clearance is not af- fected in E. coli septic shock.

Jin Long - Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A597Objective: To investigate the effect of biliary tract external drainage (BTED) on liver of severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) rats and the rela- tionship with heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway. Methods: SD rats weighing 250 -300 g were randomly assigned into five groups (n = 6): sham surgery (SS) group, SAP group, SAP + BTED group, SAP+ zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP) group, SAP + BTED + ZnPP group. The SAP model was induced via retrograde injection of 4 % sodium taurocholate (1 mL/kg) into biliopancreatic duct through duodenalwall. BTED by inserting a cannula into the bile duct of SAP rats. Tissue and blood samples were collected 24 hours after surgery. Pathological changes in organs were scored. The level of amylase, alanine transaminase(ALT), aspartate amino- transferase tumor necrosis factor- (TNF- ), real-time PCR and western-blot. Results: Liver damage in SAP rats was significantly alleviated by BTED (p < 0.05). Compared to the SAP group, the serum level of amylase, ALT, AST, were significantly lower in the BTED group (p < 0.05). The BETD treatment led to a significant reduction of TNF- , IL-6 level and a significant increase of HO-1 level in tissues than in SAP rat (p < 0.05). ZnPP significantly inhibited all mentioned effects. Conclusions: BTED protected liver against SAP related injuries via the HO-1 pathway. A598 Correlation between percentages of ventilated patients developed vap and nursing, severity and outcome indexes in icu patients A. Vakalos, V. Avramidis Xanthi General Hospital, ICU, Xanthi, Greece Correspondence: A. Vakalos - Xanthi General Hospital, ICU, Xanthi, Greece Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A598 Introduction: Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) is one of the most frequently seen infections in ICU setting and may have an im- pact not only to the length of ICU stay, but o ICU outcome as well. Objectives: The aim of our observation retrospective study was to test the hypothesis that a correlation exists between percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP (% VP) and the main nursing, se- verity and outcome indexes in our both medical and surgical ICU served in community hospital. Methods: From January 2006 to June 2014 admitted to our ICU 620 patients, mean age 64.8 years, mean length of ICU stay (LOS) 14.2 days, mean mechanical ventilation duration per ventilated pa- tient (V. Days) 12.23 days, mean APACHE II score on addition 21.2, predicted mortality 38.9 %, actual mortality 31.45 %, Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) 0.80. From our database we looked for between percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP (% PV VAP) as well as the above nursing and severity indexes per year from 2006 to 2013 and per six months period for the latest year 2014. Using linear correlation method, we looked for linear slope, correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (r2), and by linear regression method using ANOVA test we looked for p value, according % PV VAP and nursing (LOS, VD), severity (age, APACHE, Predicted mortal- ity) and outcome (Actual mortality, SMR) indexes. Results Conclusions: According to our data, there was no statistically sig- nificant correlation detected between percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP and Age, LOS, APACHE II score, Predicted Mortality, Actual Mortality and Standardized Mortality Ratio. On the other hand, we detected statistical significant positive, mod- erate correlation between percentage of ventilated patients de- veloped VAP and Ventilation Days. Our data suggest that the more the ventilation days, the more the percentage of ventilated patients developed VAP increases. Fig. 65 (abstract A596).

Wu - Changhua Christian Hospital, Medicine, Changhua, Taiwan, Province of China Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl long been used in intubated patients of chronic ob-structive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, fixed drug dosage now commonly used has not been endorsed by manufacturers nor proved clinically effective [1]. Evidences suggest drug delivered thisway has suboptimal lung deposition [2]. Also, great individual varia-tions among patients make them imprecise and unreliable[3]. Objectives: We proposed an experimental bronchodilator dosing schedule based on each individual's airway resistance (R aw) monitored periodically. This study tests its efficacy in R aw reduction. Methods: Fifty-one just-admitted, invasively ventilated COPD patients were randomly assigned to receive either personalized or fixed bron-chodilator dosing. Personal target R awwas defined by measuring each one's R awafter maximally broncho-dilated by consecutive 4, 8 and 16 puffs of fenoterol metered dose inhaler (100 mcg). Thereafter, Rawwas measured every 8 hours until the 28th day. Patients of the fixed dose group received only predetermined dose. Additionaldoses of bronchodilator were given to patients of the personalized dosing group when measured R awexceeded patient's target R aw. Both groups received rescue short-acting bronchodilator when dys-pnea exacerbated.Results: The relative deviation of R awfrom its personal target was expressed as (measured R aw- target R aw)/target R aw. Experimental group has a smaller relative R awdeviation than control group (0.09 \u00b1 P= multivariate linear regression model analysis, R awof experimental group tended to become closer to its personal target over time ( 0.031 point of relative deviation every day). Whereas that tendency was deviation away from its tar-get over time in control group (0.004 point of relative deviationevery day) (Fig). The two groups did not differ significantly in ventilator-free days from day 1 to 28, percentage of breathing with- out assistance by day 28, episode of nosocomial pneumonia, totalpuffs of rescue bronchodilator, number of drug-related adverse effector mortality at day Conclusions: Personalized dosing of bronchodilator inhalation to in- vasively ventilated COPD patients produce a better R awreduction profile than fixed dosing. The conclusions of this pilot study needconsolidation by further investigations.References 1. Dhand, R., Respir Care, 2005. 50(10): p. 1331 -4. 2.

A600 Retrospective analysis of respiratory mechanics Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A600 Introduction: In severe Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, there are important structural pulmonary changes, deterioration of the oxy- gen permeability, residual pulmonary capacity, pulmonary compli-ance, airway resistance and recruitability. The use of lower plateaupressures, lower tidal volumes and higher PEEPs can improve survival. Objective: Review our experience in the management and evolution of patients with Severe ARDS during 3 years in a second level hos-pital. In our analysis we took into account the treatment approach, mode of ventilation, PEEPs, the resistance and compliance values re- ported by the ventilator and recorded automatically.Methods: A retrospective study of ICU patients requiring mechan- ical ventilation between 2013 -2015 at Hospital Virgen de la Con- cha(Zamora, Spain) due to severe ARDS. 23 patients admitted during this period have a deterioration of PaO2/FiO2 to levelslower than or equal to 100 during a 24 hours period and requir-ing at least 5 days of ICU admission. Epidemiological data, pre- sumed cause of ARDS, management (steroids, neuromuscular blocking agents, inhaled beta-agonists), mechanical ventilationparameters (maximum PEEP,resistance,compliance,driving pres-sure) were analysed. We divided arbitrarily between HOR (high concentration of oxygen required, greater than or equal to 60 %) and LOR period (low oxygen concentration required, less than60 %).Results: The overall severe ARDS mortality was of 56.52 %. The pro- nation strategy was carried out in 39.13 % of the patients. The me- dian ICU stay, mechanical ventilation and high oxygen requirement(HOR) duration was of 24.47; 16.6 and 8.43 days. The maximum PEEPused in this group of patients was 17 cmH20; with a median value of 13.2 cmH20. The pulmonary resistance, compliance and driving pres- sure (DP) the non-surviving group were (19.21 12.10 cmH20). The mortality in the group with DP higher than 15 during HOR was 100 %, being 33.3 % in the group with lower DP values (p < 0.05).Conclusions: We found that non-surviving patients have higher resistance and lower compliance values in their respiratory sys- tem and the improvement of its values were associated with bet- ter clinical outcome.The driving pressure was the variable thatbest stratified the surviving and non-surviving patients.

Rouze - Critical Care Center, University Hospital of Lille, Lille, France Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A601 Introduction: In 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published a new surveillance paradigm for complications ofmechanical ventilation (MV), in response to difficult surveillance ofventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients (1). No study has investigated the newly defined ventilator-associated study aims to determine the impact of COPD on the incidence and outcome of VAC and IVAC, and their relationship with VAP.Methods: Retrospective analyse of prospectively collected data from patients requiring MV for more than 48 hours[SN1] . VAP episodes were assessed by prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections according to ATS/IDSA guidelines (2). VAC and IVAC were identifiedretrospectively according to current CDC definitions (1). We assessedVAC, IVAC, and VAP rates, and their impact on outcome, according to the presence or the absence of underlying COPD. The relationship between VAC, IVAC and VAP episodes was also assessed in COPDand non COPD patients. Qualitative and quantitative variables werecompared using chi-square test and Mann -Whitney Utest, respectively. Results: Data from 472 patients (132 with COPD and 340 without COPD) were analyzed. Similar rates of VAC (43.2 vs 36.8 %, p =0.199), IVAC (22.0 vs 16.8 %, p = 0.189) and VAP (28.8 vs 28.5 %, p = 0.956) were found in COPD and non COPD patients, respect- Agreement between VAC or IVAC and VAP episodes was21.1 % and 15.8 % respectively among COPD patients, 21.6 %and 33.3 % among patients without COPD. No significant differ- ence was found in outcome of patients with VAC and IVAC be- tween COPD and non COPD patients, unlike patients whodeveloped VAP (Table 42). Conclusions: Incidence and outcome of VAC and IVAC were similar in COPD and non COPD patients. Agreement between VAC or IVAC and VAP episodes was poor in the two groups. References 1.

Arnal - Hamilton Medical, Research and Development, Bonaduz, Switzerland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A602 Introduction: Mechanical ventilation is associated with ventilation in- duced lung injuries (VILI) due to lung stress and lung strain. VILI can beprevented by limiting driving pressure ( P) (1), plateau pressure (P PLAT), and tidal volume (V T). INTELLiVENT-ASV is a full closed loop ventilation so- lution that combines a ventilation and an oxygenation controller (2). Theventilation controller adjust minute volume to reach a target end tidalCO2 set by the user. Adaptive Support Ventilation (ASV) algorithm deter- mines for a given minute volume the respiratory rate (RR) - V Tcombin- ation associated with the minimal work of breathing (3). Recently, ASValgorithm has been modified in order to limit driving pressure ( P) (4). Objectives: In order to determine if INTELLiVENT-ASV selects a lung protective ventilation, this prospective observational study reports on the applied ventilation parameters and blood gas results in passive ICUpatients ventilated with INTELLiVENT-ASV in different lung conditions.Methods: Passive patients intubated and mechanically ventilated be- tween June 2015 and March 2016 were included. Excluded were pa- tients with bronchopleural fistula and brain dead patients. All patientswere ventilated using a Hamilton Medical S1 ventilator in INTELLiVENT-ASV mode. Measurements were collected once for each patient during the first day of mechanical ventilation at the time of blood gas analysis. Airway pressure and flow were measured by the proximal flow sensorof the ventilator. P PLAT and total PEEP (PEEP TOT) were measured by a 5 seconds end-inspiratory and end-expiratory occlusion, respectively. P was calculated as the difference between P PLAT and PEEP TOT. At inclusion patients were classified into one of the three predefinedlung conditions (normal lung, acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS), or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)). Data are pre- sented as median (25 th-7 5thquartiles). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) on ranks was used to compare values between each lungconditions. Statistical significance was assumed for P value below 0.05.Results: 120 patients were included (80 males, age: 67 (56 -75) years; ideal body weight 60 (49 -68)). to select a lung protective ven- tilation with limited driving pressure in passive ICU patients with dif-ferent lung conditions.

Weiler University Medical Center Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Kiel, Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Kiel, Germany Correspondence: T. - University Medical Center Schleswig- Holstein, Campus Kiel, Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Kiel, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A603 Introduction: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) can detect dele- terious side effects of mechanical ventilation like alveolar cycling and overdistension1, 2that may lead to the development of ventilator- induced lung injury (VILI). The early recognition of these effects at the bedside may accelerate the necessary modification of the ventila- tor settings. We developed an EIT-based algorithm for personalized adjustment of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and tidal vol- ume (V T) with the aim of reducing alveolar cycling and overdisten- sion and inducing lung recruitment. Objectives: To apply the EIT-based algorithm in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and to assess its feasibility for personalized adjustment of ventilator settings. Methods: We conduct a pilot clinical study in n = 20 patients requiring mechanical ventilation for early ARDS. EIT measurements are performed using the PulmoVista 500 device (Dr\u00e4ger, L\u00fcbeck, Germany). Patients are initially ventilated according to the ARDS network algorithm3using a low PEEP strategy and V Tof 6 ml/kg predicted body weight (phase ARDSNet). The patients are then ventilated according to the EIT-based algorithm during a four-hour period (phase EIT). During the phase EIT, ventilation maneuvers for overdistension and alveolar cycling detection are performed every 30 minutes and PEEP and V Tare adjusted accord- ing to the EIT results. After the four-hour period, the resulting V T,P E E P , ratio of arterial partial pressure of O 2and fraction of inspired O 2(PaO 2/ FiO 2), respiratory system compliance (C rs), driving pressure ( P4), stand- ard deviation of regional ventilation delay (SDRVD40)2and other pa- rameters are compared to the values measured at the end of the phase ARDSNet. All results are presented as mean values \u00b1 standard deviation with p-values calculated by two-sided paired t-test. Results: T od a t e ,8 / 2 0p a t i e n t s( 4m e n ,4w o m e n ,a g e6 2 \u00b1 1 7y e a r s , height 171 \u00b1 7 cm) were included. C omparing the phases ARDSNet and EIT, the interim analysis revealed that V Tand PEEP changed from 398 \u00b1 54 to 388 \u00b1 117 ml (p = 0.81) and from 8.6 \u00b1 1.1 to 14.3 \u00b1 2.6 mbar (p < 0.01), respectively. PaO 2/FiO 2improved from 159 \u00b1 31 to 233 \u00b1 56 mmHg (p = 0.01). We found no significant changes in C rs( f r o m 3 7\u00b17 t o 4 0\u00b1 13 ml/mbar, p = 0.48), P (from 10.8 \u00b1 1.6 to 9.8 \u00b1 1.5 mbar, p = 0.14) and SDRVD40 (from 11.2 \u00b1 4.1 to 8.6 \u00b1 2.5 %, p = 0.07). Conclusions: Our preliminary results indicate that adjustment of mechanical ventilation according to the EIT-based algorithm is feas- ible and leads to ventilator settings that are associated with im- proved oxygenation.

A604 Selecting positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) by electrical impedance tomography (EIT): a feasibility clinical study N. Eronia1, T. Italy Correspondence: N. Eronia - San Gerardo Hospital, Monza, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A604Introduction: PEEP is a key element of protective mechanical ventila- tion. Nevertheless, the identification of feasible bedside methods for \"optimal\" PEEP selection is still controversial. EIT allows real time monitoring of changes in End Expiratory Lung Im- pedance ( EELI), We rea- soned that EELI decrease after a Recruitment Maneuver (RM) might indicate alveolar de-recruitment and inadequate PEEP. Thus, we aimed at identifying PEEP level able to minimize decrease of EELI. Methods: We enrolled 15 intubated sedated paralyzed hypoxemic patients undergoing controlled ventilation. The study consisted of 3 steps during which protective tidal volume and FiO 2were kept con- stant and EELI was continuously monitored: - Step 1: PEEP was selected according to the ARDSnet protocol1. - Step 2: a) a RM was performed, applying pressure of 40 cmH 2Of o r 40 seconds; b) EELI was measured within 30 seconds ( EELI 30sec)a n d after 10 minutes ( EELI if we observed wR Mw a sp e r f o r m e df o l l o w e db yP E E Pi n c r e a s e by 2 cmH 2O. Steps b) and c) were repeated until PEEP associated with 66). - Step 3: a new RM was performed, and PEEP was increased by 2 cmH 2O (EIT-PEEP + 2). Results: PEEP selection according to EIT was feasible in 13/15 pa- tients. EIT-PEEP was significantly higher than \u00b1 2 cmH 2O vs. 9 \u00b1 p PaO 2/FiO 2improved, both at EIT-PEEP and EIT-PEEP + 2 (190 \u00b1 85 and 205 \u00b1 93 vs. 161 \u00b1 67, p < 0.05) but re- spiratory system compliance didn't change (p = 0.114). However, EIT waveforms showed that at higher PEEP regional compliance of the ventral lung was reduced (6 \u00b1 5 ml/cmH 2O and 8 \u00b1 5 ml/cmH 2O, p < 0.01), likely indicating relative hyperdistension, and improved in dorsal lung region (22 \u00b1 8 ml/cmH 2O and ml/cmH 2O, p < 0.001), possibly indicating recruitment; a consensual and significant increase of Cumulated Hypedistension2was observed in non-dependent lung zones at EIT- PEEP + 2 (+18 \u00b1 25 % vs. ARDSnet PEEP, p < 0.001). Conclusions: PEEP setting by EIT appears feasible in a large fraction of patients, allowing a bedside disclosure of recruitment and hyperdistension. References 1.

EIT PEEP settingIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 311 of 607Background: Standard ventilation strategies in patients undergoing lung transplantation have not been established. The use of lung pro- tective ventilatory strategies during and immediately after lung trans-plantation could minimize the potential additional mechanical injuryinduced by increased pulmonary stress and strain. Targeting tidal volumes based on recipient size may lead to ventilator induced-lung injury (VILI) to the donor lungs, especially if the allograft is relativelyundersized, contributing to the occurrence of primary graft dysfunc-tion (PGD). Objective: To evaluate the association between mechanical ventila- tion settings during the first 24 hours post bilateral lung transplant- ation with the diagnosis of ISHLT PGD grade 3 at 72 hours post reperfusion (PGD3-72 h) and the potential role of donor/recipientlung size mismatch.Methods: Retrospective study of 381 consecutive patients who underwent bilateral lung transplantation between January 2010 and December 2014 at the Toronto General Hospital. The association ofthe post transplant ICU mechanical ventilation settings and out-comes was performed using logistic regression. Results: 33 (8.7 %) out of 381 patients had PGD3-72 h. In the univari- ate analysis the following settings of mechanical ventilation at ICUadmission were significantly associated with PGD3-72 h: positiveend-expiratory pressure (OR 1.55, 95 % CI 1.31-1.84), driving pressure (OR 1.11, 95 % CI 1.01-1.24) and tidal volume according to donor pre- dicted body weight (donor PBW) (OR 1.35, 95 % CI 1.01-1.81). Inter-estingly, PGD3-72 h was not significantly associated with tidalvolume according to recipient predicted body weight (recipient PBW) (OR 1.19, 95 % CI 0.80-1.77). Donor/recipient lung size mis- match was calculated according to the ratio between donor and re-cipient predicted total lung capacity (pTLC ratio). Tidal volume setaccording to recipient PBW was 6.6 mL/kg \u00b1 0.7 in undersized grafts (pTLC ratio < 6.7 ml/kg \u00b1 0.7 in non-undersized grafts (pTLC ratio 1). When tidal volume was computed according to donor PBW, it was significantly higher in patients with undersizedgrafts (pTLC ratio < 1) compared to non-undersized grafts tio1) (7.2 ml/kg \u00b1 0.9 vs \u00b1 0.7, p < 0.001). The incidence of PGD3-72 h was higher in undersized compared to non-undersizedgrafts (12 % vs 6 %, p = 0.052), but not statistically significant.Conclusions: Following double lung transplantation, setting of tidal volume according to recipient, instead of donor, PBW may underesti- mate the effect of mechanical ventilation on the development ofPGD3-72 h. Future studies are required to confirm the potential con-tribution of VILI to the occurrence of PGD. References 1. Diamond JM et al.

A prospective study in mechanically ventilated ICU patientsE. Durlinger1, Spoelstra-de Y. 1VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, Intensive Care, Amsterdam, Netherlands;2VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, Internal Medicine, Amsterdam, NetherlandsCorrespondence: E. Durlinger - VU University Medical Center Amsterdam, Intensive Care, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A606 Purpose: Concerns have been expressed regarding a possible associ- ation between arterial hyperoxia and adverse outcomes in critically ill patients, including those with cardiac ischemia, stroke or post-resuscitation. Oxygen status is commonly monitored noninvasively byperipheral saturation monitoring (SpO 2). However, the risk of hyperoxia above specific SpO 2in critically ill patients levels is unknown. Thepurpose of this study was to determine a threshold value of SpO 2 above which the prevalence of arterial hyperoxia distinctly increases. Design: A prospective observational study in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients in a tertiary referral center.Materials and methods: In 100 patients, we collected 200 arterial blood gases (ABG) and simultaneously registered SpO 2levels, as well as hemodynamic and ventilation parameters, vasoactive medicationand clinically assessed peripheral perfusion. Patients under thera-peutic hypothermia were excluded. Results: The risk of arterial as PaO 2> 100 mmHg or >125 mmHg, was negligible when SpO 2was95 % or 96 %, re- spectively. The majority (89 % and 54 %, respectively for PaO 2> 100 mmHg and 125 mmHg) of ICU patients with SpO 2of 100 % had arterial hyperoxia. The relation between SpO2 and PaO 2was not clealry affected by hemodynamic or other clinical variables (pH,pCO 2, body temperature, recent blood transfusion). Conclusions: In critically ill patients, the risk of arterial hyperoxia in- creases when SpO 2is >95 %. Above this saturation level, supplemen- tal oxygen should be administered with caution in patientspotentially susceptible to adverse effects of hyperoxia. A607 Effects of \"express \"settings in respiratory system mechanics and gas exchange in ARDS patients M.A. Alfaro1, F. Parrilla1, della Scienza di Torino, Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care, Torino, Italy Correspondence: M.A. Alfaro - Hospital de i Sant Pau, Servei de Medicina Intensiva, 4(Suppl 1): A607 Introduction: The \"Express \"strategy is a method for PEEP titration, where PEEP is set to reach an airway plateau pressure (Pplat) of 28to 30 cmH 2O in ARDS patients1. Objectives: To compare the changes between the baseline ventilator settings and the \"Express \"strategy in terms of respiratory system me- chanics and gas exchange.Methods: Patients with early (<48 hours) moderate ARDS were in- cluded (Berlin definition). Baseline settings were adjusted according to our routine clinical prac-tice and thereafter PEEP level was titrated to reach a Plat 28 -30 cmH 2O (\"Express \"strategy). FiO 2, respiratory rate (RR) and tidal volume (Vt) were kept unchanged. Measurements of respiratory system mechanics and gas exchange were done at baseline and after 2 hours of \"Express \" settings. Patients were classified as responders ornon responders accord- ing to their change in PaO 2/FiO 2(>25 mmHg) as described2. Results: We prospectively analysed 12 consecutive patients (9 males, aged 56 \u00b1 19 years). A comparison of respiratory system mechanicsand gas exchange between baseline and \"Express \"is detailed in Table 44As expected, the overall comparisons showed significant changes in PEEP and Pplat and a significant improvement in oxygen- ation. The main differences between PEEP responders (n = 6) and PEEP non responders (n = 6) are shown in Table 45. Conclusions: Overall, patients with moderate ARDS significantly im- proved oxygenation when the PEEP \"Express \"strategy was imple- mented. However, half of our patients did not improve oxygenationand parameters of respiratory mechanics also worsened. References 1. Mercat A et al.

Heines, U. University Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A608 Introduction: Best dynamic compliance (Cdyn) has been proposed to titrate PEEP(1). Since electrical impedance tomography (EIT) gives re- gional information on ventilation distribution it may be superior for optimizing PEEP. To support the decision making of PEEP setting, guided by EIT, the global inhomogeneity index (GI) was developed. The GI is a global value which quantifies the homogeneity of tidal volume distribution. The smaller the GI, the more homogeneous tidal volume is distributed within the ventilated area. It has been argued whether best PEEP is established when the air is most homoge- neously distributed in the lungs(2). Objectives: We hypothesize that the GI is no t suitable to determine best PEEP and EIT guided PEEP is not ident i c a lt oP E E Ps e ta tt h eb e s tC d y n . Methods: In our institution best PEEP guided by EIT is determined as the best compromise between alveolar overdistension and alveolar collapse during an incremental and decremental PEEP trial. Data were analysed with offline software (EITdiag; Dr\u00e4ger Medical) that calculates overdistension and collapse. In a retrospective analysis of 71 patients with respiratory failure due to different reasons we com- pared the best PEEP according to EIT with Cdyn and according to the GI with Cdyn. A PEEP difference greater than or equal to 4 cmH 2O is defined as a clinical relevant difference. All patients were ventilated with Evita Dr\u00e4ger ventilators in a BIPAP mode. Results: In 82 % (58/71) of the cases GI PEEP differs 4 cmH 2Oo r more compared to Cdyn and in 18 % (13/71) of the casesbetween EIT and Cdyn. The individual differences are shown in Figs. 67and 68. Conclusions: The GI is not useful to determine best PEEP in the above mentioned manner. Best global Cdyn may be influenced by the effects of overdistension as well as atelectasis(3). EIT can visualize this, enhancing the de cision on the best compromise between alveolar overdistension and collapse. Whether EIT guided PEEP is better than Cdyn guided PEEP remains to be determined.

Blankman - Erasmus Medical Center, Adult Intensive Care, Rotterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A609 Introduction: In order to avoid Ventilator Induced Lung Injury (VILI) it is important to improve ventilation homogeneity. Homogeneousventilation reduces lung stress and strain diminishing lung damage.To open up atelectatic tissue recruitment maneuvers can be per- formed. However, it is remains unclear whether fast or slow PEEP steps should be applied.Objectives: Ventilation homogeneity, as measured by Electrical Im- pedance Tomography (EIT), during fast and slow PEEP trials in healthy and ARDS lungs. Methods: In eight pigs EIT measurements were performed before and after induction of ARDS with oleic acid. A fast PEEP trial was per-formed from 0 -26 cmH 2O in steps of 2 cmH 2O. The slow PEEP trial was performed with PEEP levels from 0 -25 cmH 2O in steps of 5 cmH 2O. During the fast PEEP trial each PEEP step was applied for 1 minute, whereas during the long PEEP trial each PEEP level was ap-plied for 5 minutes. From the EIT data the intratidal gas distribution (ITV) was calculated. The ITV divides the impedance curve of the in- spiration in eight equal-volume sections, from which the contributionof the dependent and non-dependent region during a breath can becalculated. Results: For the fast PEEP trial homogeneous ventilation was found at 6 and 14 PEEP in non-ARDS and ARDS lungs respectively. For theslow PEEP trial this was 5 and 15 cmH 2O. Conclusions: ARDS lungs need significantly higher PEEP levels for homogeneous ventilation as compared to healthy lungs. However, no difference in optimal PEEP could be found between fast and slowPEEP steps. Therefore, we advice to apply fast PEEP steps in order toavoid high forces acting on lung tissue for a longer period. A610 Application of adaptive support ventilation in korean patients with acute lung injuryW.Y. W.Y. Chung - Ajou University, Pulmonology, Suwon, Republic of Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A610 Introduction: Adaptive support ventilation (ASV) is a novel electronic ventilator protocol that incorporates the recent and sophisticatedmeasurement tools and algorithms. The target tidal volume and respiratory rate are continually adapted to patient's respiratory physics and varying medical conditions. In in-jured lung, the ASV should actively adjust ventilatory parametersachieving minimal work of breathing to meet the lung protective strategies. Objectives: We applicated ASV to patients with lung injury to verify its efficacy in Korean population.Methods: We observed initial mechanical ventilation parameters in 114 patients receiving ASV due to various causes (48 lung injuries including 27 community acquired pneumonia, 9 hospital acquired pneumonia, 5interstitial lung diseases, 4 pulmonary tuberculosis and 3 idiopathiccases; 66 without lung injury which comprise 33 trauma cases, 18 strokes, 9 suicidal attempts and 6 other cases). The mean age of stud- ied population was 57.5 years (male: female = 42:15). The data were col-lected within the first 12 hours of mechanical ventilation.Results: Mean age of lung injury group was 63 years (53.3 for normal lung group; p< 0.05), PaO 2per inspired fraction of O 2(PF ratio) was 207.7 \u00b1 61.2 (388 \u00b1 103 for normal lung group, p < 0.05), minutevolume was 7.6 \u00b1 2.21 l (7.1 \u00b1 1.83 l for normal lung p> 0.05), inspiratory was 43.0 \u00b1 8.2 l/min (39.2 10.3 l/min for normal lung group, p> 0.05), expiratory flow was 41.8 \u00b1 11.4 L/min (39.2 \u00b1 12.2 l/min for normal lung group, p> 0.05), peak pressure and plat- eau pressure were 26.8 \u00b1 10.2 normal lung group, p> 0.05), in- spiratory resistance was 13.5 \u00b1 5.6 cmH 2O/s/l (12.4 \u00b1 5.3 cmH 2O/s/l for normal lung group, p> 0.05). Static compliance was measured at 26.7 \u00b1 7.9 ml/cmH 2O in lung injury normal lungs; p< 0.05), and inspiratory to expiratory time ratio in lung injuries was 0.5 (0.55 in normal lungs, p> 0.05). Expiratory time constant (RCexp) in lung injuries was 0.54 \u00b1 1.7 s (0.79 \u00b1 2.2 s in nor-mal lungs). In lung injury patients, the tidal volume was smaller (8.35 \u00b1 2.38 ml/Kg vs 6.20 \u00b1 1.89 ml/Kg in normal lung group, p< 0.05) and respiratory rate was higher (19.8 breaths/min vs 15.2 breaths/min fornormal lung group, p< 0.05). Conclusions: As expected, adaptive support ventilation delivered smaller tidal volume and higher respiratory rates for injured lungs. ASV efficiently operated in Korean ALI patients without any seriousdrawbacks and favorably adjusted the tidal volume and respiratoryrates combination in relation with RCexp to meet lung protective strategies.

Worral - University Hospital Birmingham, Critical Care Medicine, Birmingham, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A611 Introduction: LPV is the gold standard for mechanically ventilated patients with features of, or at risk of ARDS1. Uptake of ARDSnet guidelines into clinical practice has been variable3; this service im- provement project identifies some of the barriers to changing prac-tice and demonstrates that improvement is possible. Objectives: We identified the variation in practice in mechanical ven- tilation across an 78 bedded mixed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in a ter-tiary referral centre and implemented a strategy to promote LPV. Weaimed to identify and address the barriers to the use of LPV through an ongoing education program. Methods: Audits have been performed comparing unit practice to the guidelines for LPV issued by ARDSnet. All staff on the unit wereinvited to respond to an electronic survey regarding the use of LPV in our unit, Unit guidelines have been written to guide all staff in the use of LPV and bedside laminates supporting LPV decision makinghave been attached to all the ventilators in our unit.Results: There has been an improvement in the percentage of pa- tients compliant with lung protective ventilation from 14.9 % to 29.0 %, a decrease in peak airway pressures greater than 30 cmH20and an increase in those ventilated with tidal volumes less than6 ml/kg (26 % to 64 %). There is an ongoing downward trend in tidal volumes with 64 % of the final cohort ventilated at < 6 ml/kg com- pared with a majority of 6 -8 mls/kg in the previous two cohorts. Key barriers to the use of LPV were identified.Conclusions: We have demonstrated that with guideline implemen- tation, education, promotion and decision support tools LPV per- formance can be improved. Whilst the tide is changing, there is stilla significant performance gap; the implementation of change intohealthcare practice faces challenges of information dissemination, unit culture, perceived role understanding, authority hierarchy and variation between multiple autonomous practitioners.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 314 of 607References 1.

Arcispedale University, Respiratory and Critical Care Group (Rcare), Department Health Science and Technology, Aalborg, Denmark Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A612 Introduction: Inappropriate mechanical ventilation can lead to dy- namic hyperinflation and autoPEEP. In the absence of an esophageal catheter, dynamic hyperinflation is typically evaluated from the ex-piratory flow profile with the absence of zero flow at end expirationillustrating incomplete expiration. In patients with spontaneous breathing, expiratory profiles can vary breath to breath, making inter- pretation of flow profiles difficult. Additional information may bepresent in the capnography signal. As incomplete expirations willresult in early termination of the expiratory CO2 signal and low end- tidal CO2 (ETCO2), a combination of complete and incomplete expi- rations will result in variability in ETCO2.Objectives: This study investigates whether systematic patterns of expiratory flow and ETCO2 exist in mechanically ventilated patients with spontaneous breathing. Methods: Respiratory flow and capnography signals were analysed in eleven patients on pressure support ventilation, each ventilated at 3 - 5 pressure support levels. Part of these data have been published previously (1). Flow signals were analysed to calculate the average number of incomplete expirations over a 20 breath window. CO2signals were analysed to calculate the variability (2*SD) in ETCO2over the same window. Data including 2350 sets of 20 breaths were categorized according to the analysis of flow into 3 groups, few in- complete expirations (<2 in 20), some incomplete expirations (2 -18 in 20) and many incomplete expirations (>18 in 20); and the variabil-ity of ETCO2 was calculated for each of these groups. A Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare median ETCO2 variability be- tween groups.Results: Significant differences were found for median ETCO2 vari- ability between the three groups. For few (<2) and many (>18) in- complete expirations, ETCO2 variability was low (0.13 kPa and 0.19 kPa, respectively) indicating consistently complete or incomplete ex-pirations. For the group of some incomplete expirations (2 -18) ETCO2 variability was significantly higher (p < 0.05), at 0.44 kPa, with great variability observed in both expiratory flow and CO2 signals. Conclusions: These results indicate that systematic patterns can be seen in expiratory flow and capnography signals. Combining thesesignals may provide a useful source of information for easier evalu- ation of dynamic hyperinflation.References 1.

THE IMMUNOCOMPROMIZED PATIENT IN THE ICU A613 Postoperative morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery patientswith a history of malignancyF. Ampatzidou 1, A. Vlachou2, Surgery, Thessaloniki, GreeceCorrespondence: F. Ampatzidou - G. Papanikolaou Hospital, Cardiac Surgery ICU, Thessaloniki, Greece Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A613 Introduction: Cancer survival rates are improving over time. Co- existence of cardiac disease requiring cardiac surgery and a history of malignancy is not unusual. Whether malignancy history impairsshort-term outcomes after cardiac surgery has not been well studied.Objectives: Aim of this study is to describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients with a history of solid tumor or hematological malignancy who underwent cardiac surgery procedure under the useof cardiopulmonary bypass.Methods: A total of 1618 consecutive patients underwent cardiac surgery from May 2012 to March 2016. Our clinic's electronic database was searched for patients with a history of solid tumoror hematological malignancies (Group A) The following factorswere compared between group A and group B (control): Age, Euroscore II, total red blood transfusions > 3units, post-op low car- diac output syndrome (LCOS), prolonged mechanical ventilation(>24 hours), post-op non-invasive ventilation(NIV) because of re-spiratory failure, acute kidney injury(AKI-RIFLE criteria), post-op atrial fibrillation and mortality. Statistical analysis was based on x square test.Results: History of malignancy was found in 47 (9 females) patients (2,9 %, group A): 9 prostate, 8 breast, Hodgin) and 1 sarcoma. In all patients, cancerwas in remission. Performed procedures were (6 emergency):41CABG \u00b1 valve, 5 thoracic aorta surgery and 1 resection of heart sarcoma. Cancer \u00b1 vs 2,1 \u00b1 3,3.Median ICU days were 2 for both groups. Median mechanicalventilation time was 8 hours for group A vs 7 hours for group B. No re-intubations, no strokes, no sternal wound infections were recorded for group A while mortality was 0 %. Comparing the 2groups for transfusions with > 3RBCs (9/47, p = 0,8) and LCOS (1/47, p = 0,58) no statistical difference was found.Conclusions: History of cancer has no impact on postoperative mor- tality and morbidity in patients after cardiac surgery under the use of cardiopulmonary bypass.

N. Saraj, S. H.M. Correspondence: S. Rijkenberg - OLVG, ICU, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A614 Introduction: The outcomes of HIV-infected patients, hematologic transplant recipients and cancer patients have gradually improved over the last 30 years outside the ICU. But research on the outcomes of these and other groups of critically ill immunocompromised pa- tients is scarce. It is unclear if these patients show a comparable im- provement in outcome and, if so, whether this is due to a change in patients' characteristics such as severity of illness. Objectives: Determine the outcomes and characteristics of critically ill immunocompromised patients over the last decade. Methods: Retrospective cohort study in a Dutch Intensive Care Unit (ICU) between 2005 and 2015. All adult patients fulfilling the defin- ition of the APACHE II comorbidity immunologic insufficiency were eligible for the analysis. The outcomes were analyzed in two cohorts: 2005 -2010 (I) and 2011 -2015 (II). Results: A total of 861 immunocompromised patients were admitted to the ICU between 2005 and 2015 (cohort I: n = 457 and cohort II: n = 404). After correction with the APACHE IV pm, there was no sig- nificant difference in ICU mortality (I:16 % vs. II:21 %) and hospital mortality (I:24 % vs. II:30 %) between the cohorts (adjusted odds ra- tio ( OR 1.93], respectively). Patients in cohort II had 11 % more medical ad- missions (p = 0.001), used 6 % more oral anti-diabetic medication (p = 0.002) and suffered 5 % more from chronic kidney insufficiency (p = 0.012) compared to cohort I. The standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of cohort I was 0.71 95%CI [0.61-0.79] vs. 0.82 95%CI 0.74- 0.87] in cohort II. See Fig. 69. The largest immunocompromised group consisted of patients using corticosteroids (n = 206 cohort I, n = 140 cohort II). The ICU mortality in this group showed an increase of 9 % in cohort II (15 % vs. 24 %, p = 0.047) and the hospital mortality showed an increase of 8 % (23 % vs. 31 %, p = 0.158). The mortality rates corrected for the APACHE IV pm did not significantly differ be- tween the cohorts (adj. OR: 1.35 95%CI [0.74-2.45] and adj. OR: 2.1 95%CI in cohort II had 13 % more med- ical admissions (p = 0.02), used 10 % more oral anti-diabetic medication (p = 0.01) and suffered 6 % more from chronic kidney insufficiency (p = 0.03) compared to cohort I. Conclusions: Survival of immunocompromised critically ill patients, including of the largest subgroup, did not change over the last decade, however, patient characteristics did. Patients admitted during the last five years have more co-morbidities and had more medical admissions. These results suggest that recently ad- mitted critically ill immonocompromised patients are more ser- iously ill than in the past.

Morgan, H. Garrard, H. Buckley Royal Bolton NHS Trust, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Bolton, UK Correspondence: A.A.J. Donnelly -Royal Bolton NHS Trust, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Bolton, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A615 Introduction: 25 % of UK HIV patients remain undiagnosed.A large proportion present with a late diagnosis1.Late diagnosis is linked with HIV related sequelae,often culminating in critical care admissio- n.Early diagnosis in critically ill patients has a marked impact on out- comes and costs.Testing based on traditional HIV risk factors lacks sensitivity.The UK National Guideline (UKNG) suggests using certain HIV indicator illnesses to prompt testing2.This may provide a frame- work for HIV testing in critical care.No formal critical care specific guideline exists in the UK. Less than 10 % of UK critical care units fol- low a local HIV testing policy and the minority using UKNG report poor compliance3. Objectives: We aimed to audit all patients admitted to our critical care unit against UKNG for HIV testing and to assess HIV prevalen- ce.UKNG recommends where HIV prevalence exceeds 2/1000 of the population,all medical admissions should be tested.Public Health England data places our prevalence at 1.8/1000 of the population.Lo- cal expert opinion suggests the prevalence is over 2/1000 when ac- counting for local catchment area.We aimed to evaluate our critical care unit's HIV prevalence and proportion of patients presenting with late diagnosis. Methods: A retrospective audit of all admissions to Bolton NHS Trust's critical care unit from 1/1/15 to 31/12/15 was undertaken using the critical care database.D uring this period no HIV testing protocol was in place.Critical care consultants requested HIV tests based on personal knowledge or after consultation with an HIV specialist.An HIV indicator illness had a defined aetiology other than HIV.The virology lab database was assessed for all HIV tests sent within the Trust and cross-referenced to the critical care database. Results: 388 records were identified(382 patients, 6 re- admissions).68 % were medical patients and 32 % were acute or elective surgical.No patients were known to be HIV positive be- fore admission.28 patients (7 %) were tested for HIV. 71 % of these had an acute respiratory illness as the HIV indicator ill- ness.96 patients met UKNG criteria for HIV testing. 80 % of these had an acute respiratory illness.6/28 patients tested positive for HIV equating to a prevalence 15/1000 population.4/6 HIV positive patients presented with late diagnosis. Conclusions: Based on national guidelines,25 % of patients admit- ted to our critical care unit,had indicators to test for HIV.Ad hoc testing only lead to 7 % of admissions being tested.The positive rate was high,leading us to assume missed diagnosis in the inter- ested population. Based on this data,we are changing our policy to routine testing for all admissions with an opt-out for some pa- tient groups.Other UK critical care units have adopted a similar strategy3.

A616 Bleeding, thrombosis and thromboelastography in intensive care patients with haematological malignancy and severe sepsis L. Russell1,2, N. L. Russell - Hvidovre Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A616 Fig. 69 (abstract A614). SMRIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 316 of 607Introduction: Intensive care unit (ICU) patients with haematological malignancy have an increased risk of bleeding and thrombotic com- plications1, adding to complications such as sepsis, respiratory failure and renal failure and thereby increasing the mortality2-5. Traditionally conventional methods (such as platelet count, APTT, INR and fibrinogen) remain the standard approach, but more recently global haemostatic methods such as thromboelastography (TEG)have gained impact6. Objective: The aim of this study was to observe whether TEG could predict bleeding and thrombosis in haematological ICU patients.Methods: Post-hoc analysis of haematological patients included in a single ICU centre in the 6S trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00962156)7. Clinical characteristics, TEG measurements within 24-hours of ran-domisation and bleeding complications according to WHO criteria8 were retrieved from the 6S trial database. The patient's electronic files were reviewed for thrombotic events. We used receiver operat- ing characteristic (ROC) curves to analyse the ability of TEG to predictbleeding events.Results: 202 patients with severe sepsis were admitted to the ICU of Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, and included in the 6S trial within 6 (IQR 1 -16) hours of admission. Of these, 41 had haematological ma- lignancy and were analyzed in the present study. Median age, SAPSII and SOFA score were 66 (IQR 61 -69), 64 (IQR 52 -74 and 10 (IQR 9 - 11), respectively (Table 46). During the ICU stay 19 patients (46 %) had a bleeding episode. Nine (22 %) of these patients bled withinthe first five ICU-days. Two (5 %) patients had a thrombosis duringthe first five ICU-days. None of the 41 patients had a \"normal \"TEG with all parameters within the reference ranges (Table 47). There was no obvious relationship between TEG values and the risk ofthrombosis. All baseline TEG variables were poor predictors of bothbleeding within 5 days of inclusion and during the ICU admission (Table 48). Conclusion Baseline TEG did not predict bleeding in our heteroge- neous cohort of haematological ICU patients with severe sepsis.Thrombotic events were few. References 1. Cook et al.

Goh - University of Oxford, Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A617 Introduction: Undiagnosed HIV infection poses a significant public health burden in the UK; a fifth of infected individuals remain un-aware.1Our ICU is situated in Milton Keynes, a city with an unexpect- edly high HIV prevalence and one of the highest late diagnosis rates in the UK.2This is relevant to critical care as HIV infection may influ- ence a patient's outcome and since ICU admission provides a uniqueopportunity to offer testing. UK Guidelines for HIV testing3do not specifically address ICU patients. However, consideration of universal testing is recommended for med-ical inpatients when local prevalence exceeds 2 per 1000, as in MiltonKeynes. Our previous practice of HIV testing was based on informal as- sessment of risk, with correspondingly low testing rates. Evidence shows that testing rates increase when opt-out policies are adopted inother settings 3and we elected to implement this in our ICU. In patients with capacity, we sought consent prior to testing. In those lacking cap- acity, testing was performed in their best interests. There is limited UK data on the cost-effectiveness of expanded HIV testing but US datasuggests it is cost-effective if 1 new diagnosis is made per 1,000 tests.4 We report our experiences following a year of opt-out testing.Table 46 (abstract A616).

Methods: All unplanned admissions to our ICU were included and pathology records interrogated to determine if HIV testing was per- formed during ICU admission or in the 3-month preceding period. We compared testing rates prior to (August 2014-January 2015; 6 months) and after (April 2015-March 2016; 12 months) the intro- duction of opt-out testing. Results: Our initial 6-month analysis (n = 196) showed that the major- ity of patients (89.8 %, n = 176) were not tested during the study period. Of the 10.2 % (n = 20) tested, 4.6 % (n = 9) were tested on ICU. We admitted 391 patients in the first year of opt-out testing. The percentage of untested patients halved from 89.8 % to 45.5 % [Fig. 70] due to a 10-fold increase in ICU testing rate with 50.6 % of patients (n = 198) receiving testing on ICU. The number of patients tested prior to ICU admission remained low. Of the 207 tests per- formed on ICU, one new diagnosis was made and the patient inte- grated into local specialist services. Of the patients able to consent, none declined testing. Conclusions: Implementation of an opt-out testing policy improved our rates of HIV testing and yielded one new diagnosis. We have found this new policy to be feasible and cost-effective.

[1] Earlier admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) has resulted in better survival rates for critic- ally ill cancer patients. [2] Selecting patients likely to benefit fromICU admission is based on complex criteria, and some ICU specific therapies such as mechanical ventilation have been associated with an increase in mortality. [3] Objectives: To identify clinical characteristics of oncological patients admitted to our ICU and to identify risk factors associated with 14 day mortality in this specific population. Methods: Five - year retrospective observational analysis was per- formed including all patients with a personal history of active onco- logical malignancies admitted to the ICU of a tertiary care University Hospital in Spain. Patients\u00b4 demographic, clinical features and out- come were recorded. Data were expressed as frequency (percentage) and median (interquartile range IQR). Multivariate logistic regression with significant covariables at 0,05 was performed to identify specific risk factors for 14 day mortality. Results: One hundred and thirty six patients were registered in this period. Age (median 60,IQR 2575: 5270), ICU Length of stay (LOS) (median 5 (IQR 2575:28) Principal reason to admission to ICU was respiratory failure (41,9 %), followed by septic shock (33,8 %) and low conscious level (8,1 %). Top three solid malig- nancies were lung (27.2 %), followed by breast (12.5 %) and Bowel (11.8 %). No differences in co morbidities between Survi- vors and nonsurvivors at 14 day were assessed. APACHE II score was higher in non survivors median 25 (IQR 2575:18,731,5 p= 0,002) versus survivors and this group had more frequently mech- anical ventilation and vasopressors. Multivariate logistic regression for 14 day mortality assessed mechanical ventilation OR:3.59 (CI95%:1.438.97, p = 0,006) and APACHE II increases in 1score OR 1.06 (CI95%:1.011.23, p = 0,021) as independent risk factors for 14 day mortality in ICU. Conclusions: Oncological critically ill patients remain as a high mor- tality population. Mechanical ventilation and increases in one point in APACHE II score at admission to ICU are independent risk factor for 14 day mortality. References 1. Thi\u00e9ry G, Azoulay E, Darmon M et al.

A620 Evolution of ICU and six-month mortality in hematopoietic stemcell transplantation recipients admitted to an A. 4(Suppl Introduction: Although hematopoietic stem cell transplantation re- cipients (HSCTR) admitted to an ICU have a high mortality (52 %-83 %1), limited data exists regarding six-month mortality rates. The aim of our study was to investigate the outcomes and explore non- respiratory predictors of ICU and six-month mortality, and to com-pare our result with a previous publication2done in our center, in order to learn if outcome has improved. Methods: Retrospective study. We analyzed all HSCTR who were admitted to our ICU from January 2009 to March 2015. We recovered demographic data, reason for ICU admission and all the possible variables related with mortality. Statistical analysisw a sd o n eu s i n gt h eC h i - s q u a r et e s tf o rc a t e g o r i c a lv a r i a b l e sa n dthe Mann -Whitney test for continuous non-parametric variables. Results: During the study period a total of 25 HSCTR required ICU care, and this accounted for 33 admissions (7 of them were readmit-ted). General patient characteristics are shown in Table 49. The most frequent cause for ICU admission was acute respiratory fail- ure (56 %) followed by non-respiratory sepsis (7 patients; 28 %) andby acute coronary syndrome, brain stroke, hemophagocytic syn-drome and veno-occlusive disease (one case each; 4 %). Twenty pa- tients had 2 or more organ failures: respiratory (64 %), hemodynamic (64 %) and renal (72 %; use of renal replacement techniques in32 %). All patients received antibiotic treatment, and 9 of them(36 %) had positive microbiological results. Mean ICU stay was 9 days (2-35). In our study, ICU mortality was 48 % (12 of 25 patients), in-hospital mortality 60 % (15/25) and six-month mortality was72 % (18 of 25 patients). Compared to mortalities reported 30 years ago for our center the rates that we found were lower (ICU-mortality 48 vs 76 %; in-hospital mortality 60 vs 88 %) 2.Factors related to ICU and six-month mortality are listed in Table 50. Non-respiratory laboratory parameters (lactic, hemoglobin, INR, aPTT, fibrinog en) and isolated respiratory (p = 0,053) and hemodynamic (p = 0,386) failures together with theuse of vasoactive drugs (p = 0,819) renal replacement therapies (p = 0,236) or positive cultures (p = 0,656) did not reach statis- tical significance.Conclusions: Pre-ICU hospital days, 24 h SOFA, number of organ fail- ures and isolated renal failure are factors associated with ICU mortal- ity. The presence of lower counts in the first 24 h of platelets, leukocytes and neutrophils together with pre-ICU hospital days wererelated with six-month mortality. Although mortality rates in HSCTRadmitted to ICU have decreased, ICU, in-hospital and six-month sur- vival rates are still low.

In 2015, the British Committee of Standards in Haematology published an evidence based guideline outliningthe major considerations in managing critically ill patients withhaeamtological disease, for hae matologists and intensivists. Objectives: To evaluate the impact of the guideline on mortality and use of ICU resources, for adult haematology patients at our institution.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of 71 patients with a haematological disease, admitted to our 19 bed ICU between 2013 -2016. Information was collated from the Intensive care National Audit and research database and from patient records. Data wasthen organised into 2 groups (pre and post guideline) and analysedusing SPSS. Results: Patients in the study were separated into 2 groups, 40 in the pre-guideline group vs 3 0 in the post guideline group. A statistically significant improvement in mortality was found inthe group after the guideline had been implemented (43 % vs. 68 % p < 0.05) however there was no difference between the groups in duration of intensive care stay or number of organssupported. Admission APACHE-II scores were significantly betterafter the guideline had been introduced (22.3 \u00b1 7.11 vs. 25.5 \u00b1 6.3) as were measures of functional status and premorbid state. Of the patients who had respirato ry failure there was no signifi- cant difference between the groups regarding use of NIV orearly intubation that could account for our mortality results. Conclusions: The implementation of the new guideline has re- sulted in reduced mortality for patients admitted to ICU with ahaematological disease. While aspects of the guideline havemade no difference to outcome, our results demonstrate that early referrals by haematologists prior to developing multiorgan failure in individuals who have good-moderate functional cap-acity, have a positive effect on mortality. In our institution thiswas achieved with increased reliance on early warning scoringsystems, critical care outreach teams and consultant to consultant referrals. References 1. Wise MP et al.

A622 Receptors of a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation admittedto an intensive care unit. Description and analysis of factors related to survival C. D\u00edaz1, L. Fox2, M. Santafe1, Intensive Barcelona, d'Hebron Hematology, Barcelona, Spain Correspondence: C. D\u00edaz - Vall d'Hebron University Hospital, Intensive Care, Barcelona, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A622 Introduction: Receptors of a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) are a population with a high risk of developing severe compli-cations that require admission to intensive care units (ICU), which isrelated to a high mortality. So, efforts are needed in order to improve their prognostic. Objectives: Our aim was to describe the cohort of receptors of an HSCT admitted to a tertiary hospital ICU and analyze factors that arelikely to affect their survival. Methods: Retrospective study including adult (+18 years) patients who received an HSCT and required admission to ICU between 01January 2010 and 29 February 2016. Quantitative variables are pre-sented as median (IQR) and categorical as N (%). Results: Fifty patients were included, 30 (65 %) men, with a me- dian age of 52 (34 -60) years. The underlyin g leading conditions were leukemia, with 23 (46 %) patients, and lymphoma, with 17(34 %). Reduced intensity chemotherapy was employed in 24 (47 %). Allogenic transplantation was done in 42 (84 %) cases. Twenty-two (44 %) suffered GVHD, that was acute in 18 (36 %)and chronic in 7 (14 %). The patients presented on ICU admis-sion a median of 3 (2 -4) organ failures, distributed as follow: r e s p i r a t o r y3 2( 6 4% ) ,h e m o d y n a m i c2 5( 5 0% ) ,r e n a l2 9( 5 8% ) , liver 13 (26 %), hematological 37 (74 %), metabolic 22 (44 %).Initial mechanical ventilation (MV) was required in 15 (30 %), 21(42 %) high flow nasal cannula (HFNC), only one (2 %) non in- vasive mechanical ventilation and 11 (27 %) low flow systems. Finally, 27 patients (54 %) received MV. Thirty five (70 %) pa-tients needed vasoactive drugs and 14 (28 %) renal replacementtherapy (RRT). The time from the transplantation to ICU admis- sion was 33 (12 -122) days. APACHE score was 22 (15 -27). Neu- tropenia on admission was present in 20 (43 %). The HCT-CIwas 3 (2 -4).Twenty-two (46.8 %) patients were discharged to the hematology ward and 14 (29.8 %) were discharged home. Factors related to mortality: number of organ failures (3.5 vs 2.2; p = 0.016), need of MV (OR = 4.4, IC95%:1.2-16.9, p = 0.024)and renal failure (OR = 10.6, IC95%:2.4-47.6, p = 0.002). Patientswho initially were treated with HFNC and needed MV had a similar mortality than patient s initially on MV. None of the 14 patients on RRT survived. We did not find differences in mortal-ity related to APACHE score, type of HSCT, GVHD, neutropeniaand need of vasoactive drugs. In the multivariate analysis only renal failure maintained statisti cal significance (OR: 9.1, IC95%: 1.9-42.4, p = 0.005).Conclusions: Receptors of a HSCT admitted to an ICU have a great hospital mortality (70.2 %). Patients who need MV or suffer renal fail- ure have the worse prognostic. Patients initially on HFNC who re- quired MV did not have a different outcome compared to patientsinitially on MV.Table 50 (abstract A620).

P\u00e9rez de Hierro Majadahonda, Intensive Care, Madrid, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A623 Introduction: From March 1981 to June 1987, 25 patients (40 %) with a previous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) needed ICU support in our tertiary care hospital. The main cause of admission was acute respiratory failure (ARF)(18 patients). Six- teen (64 %) required mechanical ventilation (MV). Mortality amongst this group was 94 % and more than 7 days of MV was a strong factor associated with it1. Objectives: To study the evolution of HSCT patients with ARF that require ICU care, the factors associated with mortality, and to compare them to the previous data recorded in our center. Stat- istical analysis was done using the Chi-square and the Mann - Whitney tests. Methods: Retrospective study from January 2009 to March 2015. All patients admitted to the ICU with a previous history of HSCT were included. We collected demographic data, reason for admis- sion, respiratory support applied and factors associated with mortality. Results: During the period studied, 235 patients received a HSCT and 25 (10.63 %) needed ICU care. There were 33 admissions in total. Median time between the HSCT and admission was 86 days (54 - 1685). Main reason for admission was ARF (14 patients; 56 %), followed by non-respiratory sepsis (7 patients; 28 %) and by acute coronary syndrome, brain stroke, hemophagocytic syndrome and veno-occlusive disease (one case each; 4 %). Median number of or- gans that had failed upon admission was 3 (2 -4): respiratory (64 %), hemodynamic (64 %) and renal (72 %). In the ARF group we accounted for 11 pneumonias, 2 alveolar hem- orrhages and 1 pulmonary graft-versus-host disease. Seven patients met Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) criteria. The most common radiographic finding was an interstitial infiltrate (14). Twenty-three patients required respiratory support: 4 high-flow nasal cannula (16 %), 8 non-invasive MV (32 %) and 11 MV (44 %; 5 after unsuccessful non-invasive MV). Median duration of MV was10 days (5-16). Only one patient needed prone position. Three patients underwent a tracheostomy. Overall ICU mortality was 48 % (12) and 6-month survival dropped to 28 % (7). The variables associated with mortality were: failure of 3 or more organs (p = 0.047), the presence of ARDS (85.71 % vs. 38.46 %; p = 0.043), MV vs. 25 %; p = 0.022), pO 2/FiO 2ratio < 120 in the first 24 hours (p = 0.011) and ICU readmission (6 out of 7 patients: 85,7 %). Conclusions: Although nowadays fewer p atients required ICU care after a HSCT, the main reason fo r admission hasn\u00b4t changed and the mortality amongst these pati ents is still high.The presence of MV, ARDS, low pO 2/FiO 2ratio, three or more organ failures and ICU readmission is associated with mortality. The need for MV in our study was lower that in the previous one probably due to an improvement in other ways of respiratory support. References 1.

Demographic characteristicsIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 321 of 607in critically ill patients with haematological malignancies (1), however no data exists concerning the subgroup of patients receiving chemo- therapy (CT) in the ICU. Moreover, only a few small studies haveassessed outcome in this subgroup.(2)Objectives: The aim was to assess whether CT was associated with outcome, overall and within the subgroups of patients admitted to the ICU 24 hours vs. > 24 hours after hospitalisation. Furthermore, we wanted to identify prognostic indicators for hospital mortalitywithin the CT subgroup. Methods: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data on 1011 patients included between January 1 st2010 and May 1st2011 in 17 French and Belgian centres.(1) Clinically important variablesand variables associated with CT and mortality in univariate analysis (P < 0.2) were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results: Of the 1011 patients, 928 (91 %) had complete data, and 231 of them received CT in the ICU. Overall 51.9 % of the pa-tients were newly diagnosed and 50.6 % suffered from AML. Sixty-nine percent needed organ support (NIV, MV, vasopressors or dialysis). Hospital mortality was similar between CT and non-CT patients (38.5 %, vs 39.9 %, P = 0.715). However, CT patientswere younger (median vs better perform- ance status (86.1 % vs 79.5 % with ECOG 0 to 2, P = 0.025) and a lower SOFA score (5 vs 6, P = 0.002) at admission. After adjust-ment for all potential confounders, CT was associated with in-creased hospital mortality (OR 1.52, P = 0.036) as compared to non CT patients, however only when admitted in the ICU > 24 hrs after hospital admission (OR 2.99, P < 0.001). This was not thecase for CT patients admitted 24 hrs after hospital admission (OR 1.32, P = 0.396). Within the CT subgroup SOFA score (OR 1.19, P < 0.001), number of previous lines of CT (OR 1.33, P = 0.039) and comorbidity (CCI) (OR 1.15, P = 0.071) were associated withincreased mortality in multivariate analysis, while admission 24 hrs (OR 0.44, P = 0.012) was protective. Conclusions: Outcome of patients receiving chemotherapy in the ICU was similar to the general population with haematological malig-nancies, however only when admitted within 24 hrs after hospital ad-mission. Earlier referral to the ICU may be a key factor to reduce mortality in high risk patients requiring chemotherapy. References 1. Azoulay E. et al.

A625 Prognostic factors in adult cancer patients with sepsis or septic shock at admission to an intensive care unit: a single-centreretrospective cohort studyD. EPE, 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A625 Introduction: Sepsis is a common complication in cancer patients and it is associated with high mortality rates. Clinical approach in crit- ically ill cancer patients should take into account the disease courseand cancer-related determinants.Objectives: To characterise cancer patients admitted to an onco- logical intensive care unit with sepsis/septic shock and to determine baseline predictors of in-hospital mortality.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of all the adult cancer patients admitted to a 6-bed Oncological Intensive Care Unit (ICU) with the diagnosis of severe sepsis or septic shock, between 1 Janu-ary 2012 and 31 December 2015. Solid and haematological condi-tions were analysed separately. The analysis was performed with multivariate logistic regression models, using a stepwise backward elimination with complete case analysis. All the analysis was per-formed with the software Stata 12.1\u00ae. P-value was considered signifi-cant at < 0.05. Results: We identified 210 patients: the mean age was 60.8 (CI 58.8- 62.8) and 65 % were male (n = 136). About 19 % (n = 40) were post-operative and the remaining 81 % (n = 170) were medical septiccomplications; 61 % were admitted with septic shock (n = 129). The majority of cancer conditions were solid tumours - 71 %(n = 149) - and among the haematological cancers - 29 %(n = 61) - 16 % (n = 10)were admitted after bone marrow transplantation. The median ECOGperformance status score was 2. Only 6 % (n = 12) were in complete response and 65 % (n = 137) were at an initial phase of the treat- ment. Data regarding comorbidities, tumour staging, site of infection,culture-positive sepsis and organ support at admission were includedin the multivariate analysis. ICU mortality and in-hospital mortality were 34 % (n = 71) and 50 % (n = 104), respectively. Among solid tumour patients, higher scores of Simplified Acute Physiology ScoreII (SAPS II) and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Perform-ance Status showed a statistically significant association with in- hospital mortality, as expected; postoperative admission, septic shock at admission tend to be associated with worst prognosis. Regardinghaematological conditions, only Acute Physiology and Chronic HealthEvaluation (APACHE) II score was a statistically significant predictor of in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: This study highlights ECOG as a predictor of in-hospital sepsis-related mortality in patients with solid tumours and raises theawareness around the search of oncological baseline characteristics that may be determinants of sepsis-related mortality. This Onco- logical ICU mortality and respective in-hospital mortality rates aresimilar to mortality rates of sepsis/septic shock in general population.These results suggest SAPS II and APACHE II as a good predictor of in-hospital sepsis-related mortality in patients with solid tumours and haematological patients, respectively. Larger retrospective cohorts orprospective studies might strengthen these conclusions. Funding None.

MSCs theproduction of TNF- and IL-6. Injection of MSCs to septic animals re- duced mortality and improved organ function [2]. No study has in- vestigated the efficacy of MSC therapy in pts with SS, especially neutropenic pts.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 322 of 607Objectives: The aim of the study was to investigate the efficacy of MSC administration on survival and organ dysfunction in neutropenic pts with SS. Methods: In prospective single center randomized Russian clinical trial of MMSCs in severe neutropenic pts with SS (RUMCESS) (NCT 01849237) 30 neutropenic pts (WBC < 0.5x109/l) were enrolled. The pts were randomly assigned to receive either conventional therapy (CT) of SS (CT group) (15 pts) or CT plus donor MMSCs within the first 10 hours of SS (CT + MMSCs group) (15 pts). The SOFA score was cal- culated at onset of SS and in 2, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days. Fisher\u00b4s exact test, Kaplan-Meier method with the log-rank test & Cox propor- tional hazard regression model were used. Results: There were no significant differences between groups in demographic parameters. Positive blood cultures were documented in 8/15 patients in CT group and in 11/15 patients in CT + MSCs group. Baseline APACHE II scores (30.6 [95 % CI 27.0-40.1] and 30.9 [95 % CI 26.1-36.7] in the CT and MSC groups, respectively) and SOFA scores (15.9 [95 % CI 13.9-20.2] and 16.1 [95 % CI 12.1-19.0], respect- ively) were similar in both groups. During the study period, total SOFA score did not differ between the groups. However, since sec- ond day cardiovascular SOFA score and respiratory SOFA score were lower (p < 0.05) in MSCs-CT group, than in CT-group. 28-days survival rates were 20 % (3 out of 15 pts) in CT group and 60 % (9 out of 15 pts) in CT + MSCs group (P < 0.05). Despite higher 28-days survival rates in MSCs + CT group only 4 of 9 pts survived 28 days remained alive in 3 months, 5 pts died due to sepsis related organ dysfunctions. In 3 months there were no differ- ences in survival between the groups. Conclusions: Administration of MSCs in first hours of SS improves organ dysfunction and short-term survival in neutropenic pts, but doesn\u00b4t prevent death from sepsis related organ dysfunctions in long term period. Perhaps, it is required repeated administration of MSCs. References 1. Namendys-Silva S.A., et al.

Chao Chi Mei Medical Center, Intensive Care Medicine, Tainan, Taiwan, Province of China Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A627Introduction: Patients with acute respiratory failure on ventilators con- stitute the majorities of patients in intensive care units (ICU). Early extu- bation has always been one goal that medical teams want to achieve. Objectives: Rehabilitation invention has already been administered in ICUs in other countries and has successfully helped achieve the goal of early extubation. It is therefore hoped that physical therapy as intervention can help create a safe environment that facilitates early extubation for patients. Methods: The participating patients with acute respiratory failure were all in the conditions of stable hemodynamics, normal nutritional status and no infectious complications and first underwent joint as- sessment by the medical teams based on their progresses in recov- ery after treatment for their diseases before receiving rehabilitation consultation, which directed them to cardiopulmonary rehabilitation that included T-tube training. Upon the confirmation of their ventila- tor weaning indications, their endotracheal tubes were removed. They were then engaged in early ambulation activities ranging from Level II to Level IV according to their abilities. During this period, the medical teams conducted 3 sessions of education training led by physical therapists, followed by exercises and group testing. Results: Days of ventilator use were reduced from 6.3 (days) previ- ously to 4.1 (days) after improvement. The secondary goal, i.e. days in ICUs, were reduced from 10 (days) to 6.1 (days). Hospitalization costs were also reduced from NT$329,000 before improvement to NT$241,000 during improvement and NT$186,000 after improve- ment. During the improvement, no tube slippage or patient falls oc- curred. This shows that this innovative proposal has achieved its purpose and also ensured patient safety. Conclusions: It is suggested that medical teams for ventilation in se- vere cases can develop weaning protocols that have shared goals and integrate multiple technologies and find weaning solutions for ventilator dependent patients by exploring literature and relevance of content in protocols. This provides possible indicators for asses- sing healthcare for ventilator dependent patients and serves as a ref- erence for healthcare facilities in developing patient care plans. References 1.

Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the clinical status of the patients who were requiring intensive care as the victims of the Syrian civil war. Methods: Clinical characteristics, health state at admission into Gen- eral Intensive Care Unit (GICU), treatments in GICU, expected, and ac- tual mortality rates estimated based on APACHE II scores, number of patients rejected because of full bed occupancy were evaluated retrospectively among Syrian civil war victims who applied to the GCI between 01.01.2013 - 12.31.2013. Fig. 72 (abstract A626). 28-day overall survivalIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 323 of 607Results: 159 (21.4 %) of 740 patients who were monitored in GICU belonged to a Syrian nationality who were the victims of the Syrian civil war. A total of 795 patients were requested for hospitalization inGICU, while GICU stay of 55 (6.9 %) patients were rejected becauseof full bed occupancy. Mean age (34.3 \u00b1 12.4 years), gender distribu- tion (women, n = 36; 22.6 %), and men, n = 123; 77.4 %), and the mean APACHE II score (24.2 \u00b1 13.7) of the patients were recorded asindicated. The most common indications for hospitalization weremultisitel shrapnel injuries (42.7 %), subarachnoidal bleeding (SAK) (42.1 %) caused by firearm injuries, and chest gunshot wounds (5.6 %). Total number of days of GICU hospitalization were 4300 days,while patients with Syrian nationality stayed in the GICU a total of1558 (36.2 %) days. Mean duration of hospitalization was 9.7 days. Average mortality rate among all GICU patients in 2013 (26 %) was lower than that of Syrian citizens (n = 49 deaths, mortality rate30.8 %; n = 12 women; 24.4 %). The standardized mortality ratio [ob-served mortality (49/159), according to the APACHE II score of ex- pected mortality rate (48 /159) ratio] was 1.02 Conclusions: Because of higher APACHE II score, increased incidence of gunshot hwounds, and transportation of the patients from a dis-tance of over 100 kilometer under unfavourable conditions increased mortality rates were observed.

Kiss - University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A629 Introduction: The massively increasing knowledge of recent years about the importance of circadian rhythms is orientating the re- searchers from laboratories towards the bedside (1).Objectives: The daily pattern of MT production is the main regulator of circadian rhythms, with the strongest known signal of its release being the daily change of light and darkness. The aim of this pro- spective study was to determine the MT production in septic andnon-septic groups of ICU patients suffering from severe night lightpollution. Methods: Mechanically ventilated patients over 18 years, without CNS damage were enrolled in the study. Illuminance levels (IL) weremeasured by a lux meter. Serum MT levels were determined from ar-terial blood samples. Sampling and IL measurements were performed after admission at 01:00, 07:00, 13:00 and 19:00 constitutively for 96 hours. Blood samples were kept in total darkness before beingcentrifuged, then serum samples were placed into 80 \u00b0C until MT measurement was performed. Repeated correlation analysis was per- formed to investigate the correlation between illuminance and MT levels. The equality of MT variances was tested by fitting two nestedmodels and comparing their likelihoods.Results: Out of the 28 enrolled patients 15 were able to take over the study. 8 patients proved to be septic and 7 non-septic, which was sufficient to form subgroups. Out of the 16 measurements/pa-tient, 240 MT samples were analysed. Although IL were the lowest at01:00 [19(3 -101) lux], estimated MT peaks were missing, the median (IQR) was 30(24 -51) pg/ml at this time point. Although repeated cor- relation analysis between MT and IL showed a non-significantbetween-subject correlation (r = 0.438, P = 0.103), the MT variances of septic subgroup were 70 % of the non-septic variances. In spite of the low sample size the fixed effect of subgroup was statisticallyhighly significant (P < 0.0001), in general higher MT levels were ob-served in the septic subgroup. Conclusions: Our results indicate that circadian rhythm is desynchro- nized in ICU patients, as indicated by the missing MT peaks duringthe night, the absence of the normal 24 h rhythm of MT release andby the poor correlation between illumination and MT levels. This first observation suggests that absence of darkness at night and the miss- ing contrast of day and night light levels can rapidly destruct therhythm of MT release. The cause(s) of our second observation,namely that patients in septic subgroup showed lower MT variances and higher MT levels in general needs to be elucidated by studies fo- cusing on this phenomenon, conducted in larger patient population.Based on these observations, future trials on light/dark conditionsand patient outcomes could lead to redesigned healthcare environ- ments, which may help restore circadian rhythmicity and reach health benefits.

Ntantana 1, Educational Ioannina, Ntantana - Papageorgiou General Hospital, ICU, Thessaloniki, Greece Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A630 Introduction: Healthcare workers in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) en- vironment present very commonly with burnout worldwide1. Objectives: Aim of this study was to assess burnout in ICU physicians and nurses in a national level and to identify possible contributing factors.Methods: A cross-sectional, multicenter study in 18 Greek ICUs was conducted between June and December 2015. Scores of Ex- haustion, Depersonalization and Personal Accomplishment from the Maslash Burnout Inventory Questionnaire2were recorded in the 469 study participants. Univariate and multivariate logistic re-gression analysis was performed in order to identify predicting factors for burnout. Results: A high participation rate was recorded (65.7 %). Baseline par- ticipant characteristics, scores of burnout, as well as statistical com-parisons between the medical and nursing staff are shown in (Table 51and 52). ICU nurses compared to doctor participants were mainly females (80.8 %vs. 55.6 %, chi-square test, p < 0.001), almost a decade younger (p <0.001), had less working experience (p < 0.001), and declared lower job satisfaction (p = 0.001). Ex haustion scores were relatively low but statisti- cally different between doctors and nurses (22.8 % and 37.5 % respect-ively, Mann -Whitney U test, p < 0.001), while differences in scores of depersonalization and personal acco mplishment did not reach statistical significant levels. Multivariate lo gistic regression analysis (Table 53)i d e n t i - fied two independent predicting factors for high exhaustion: to be anurse (Odds ratio 1.6, 95 % CI 1.1-2.7, p = 0.05) and to have low job satis-faction (Odds Ratio 0.2, 95 % CI 0.1-0.4, p < 0.001). Other factors like gen- der, age, working experience, working in university hospitals or having personal experience of losing a close family member were found not tobe associated with burnout.Conclusions: Our results demonstrate low burnout levels in Greek ICU personnel. Nurses are more exhausted compared to doctors. The major contributing factor for burnout is job satisfaction.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 324 of 607References 1.

A631 Ulnar length and clinician estimation of height in tidal volumecalculations for lung-protective ventilationS. Gaffney, E. Black, R. Docking Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, NHS GG&C, Department of Critical Care, Glasgow, UKCorrespondence: S. Gaffney - Queen Elizabeth University Hospital, NHS GG&C, Department of Critical Care, Glasgow, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A631Introduction: Despite their importance in informing care interventions, significant barriers exist in Critical Care in regards to the measurement of height and weight. Common interventions based on weight includelung-protective ventilation in ARDS management[1], renal replacementtherapy, and antibiotic dosing. Studies have investigated the use of a calibrated ulnar length (UL) tape in tidal volume (VT) measurements [2], whilst our institution uses a formula converting actual height (AH) toideal body weight. We have demonstrated in previous audits poorcompliance with measurement of actual height and wished to investi- gate the performance of UL to improve compliance. Objectives: We performed a three-way comparison comprising height derived from UL versus AH, and clinician estimation (CE) ver- sus AH. We sought to simulate the clinical effects of applying mea-sured and derived values into the common clinical parameter of6 ml/kg VT lung-protective ventilation. Methods: We sampled 16 Critical Care patients and 4 healthy volunteers. Participants were measured supine, semi-recumbent or sitting. UL wasmeasured between olecranon process and ulnar styloid. AH was mea- sured in the position the participant was approached in, using a summa- tion of heel to knee, knee to greater trochanter (GT), and GT to vertex lengths. CE was estimated by a Consultant Intensivist, blinded to actualmeasurements. Results were analysed using Excel, with correlation of re- sults performed using Bland-Altma n plots and regression analysis. Results: A significant correlation between performance of UL and AH was obtained (P < 0.01). There was no significant correlation betweenCE and either UL or AH. Similarly, when converted to 6 ml/kg VT, a statistically significant correlation was obtained between UL and AH and (P < 0.01) but not CE.Estimates of height ranged between -16 cm and +5 cm, most com-monly underestimating height. VT extrapolated from CE gave a range between 41.4 ml and +68.4 ml. Conclusions: Significant barriers to measuring height in Critical Care exist, including lack of pre-morbid measurement, immobility, and lack of suitable equipment. Anecdotally there may have been a tendencyfor clinicians to rely on estimation of height and weight which can erro-neously form the basis for regimes in a range of interventions. Our study confirms UL validity as a proxy of formal height measurement, and the poor performance of estimation compared to AH and UL. Wepropose UL measurement as an acceptable standard of care.

Data extraction and amalgamation from multiple sources requires a systematic ap-proach, considering data quality assurance and research objectives.Objectives: The aim was to develop a reliable methodology to ex- tract and amalgamate retrospective data from dialysis machines (Pris- maflex), the clinical information system (ICIP) in the intensive careunit, and electronic laboratory systems, for use in future PK studies.Using this methodology, we compared vancomycin doses and levels in patients receiving heparin anticoagulation or RCA on CVVHDF. Methods: All patients on vancomycin and CVVHDF in 2014 were in- cluded. Vancomycin data were extracted from the laboratory infor-mation system; timing of dialysis and anticoagulation mode from ICIP (Philips); and dialysis flow data from the Prismaflex (Gambro) machines. Extracted data reliability was categorised as high or lowrisk in terms of time-sensitivity and patient-specificity for internal val-idation of data extraction and amalgamation. High risk data had a two part validation system to match variables across databases. Risk assessment was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team. Open sourcetechnologies were utilised including and MySQL (mysql.com); and SPSS V17 (IBM Corp.) was used for data analysis. Ethical approval was obtained. Results: A fully coded-anonymised database for retrospective analysis was created.58 patients were included, representing 323 patient days with an average of 5.57 (SD 2.14) days per patient. This resulted in 255, 56, 8 and 4 dialysis days on heparin, citrate, both and no anticoagulation,respectively. The average vancomycin dose was 1162.22 mg(+/437 mg) and 1306.12 mg (+/ 343 mg) on heparin and RCA re- spectively (p = 0.032). Trough vancomycin levels were within range in 37.9 % of levels in heparinised patients and 29.72 % of levels in pa-tients on RCA. There was no significant association between anticoa-gulation and vancomycin trough levels in target range, 2(1) = 1.563, p = .668. Conclusions: This methodology represents a promising approach for retrospective data analysis. Our initial results indicate that anticoagu-lation modality used is associated with vancomycin dose, but not the proportion of trough levels in target range. Work is ongoing to fur- ther validate data amalgamation processes and explore vancomycinPK in these patients. References 1. Trotman, Williamson, Shoemaker et al., Clin Infect Dis.

IsmailKing Fhad University Hospital, Department of Pharmacy, Al-Khobar,Saudi Arabia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A633 Introduction: The impact of clinical pharmacist on preventing drug re- lated problems in critically ill patient has been well reported in several randomized control trials. The critical care pharmacist impact is greatly essential in therapeutic drug monitoring, renal dosing, drug-drug inter-action, and de-escalation of antibio tic therapy and others in this setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the types of inter- ventions, clinical significance and cost saving involved with each intervention.Methods: A prospective observational study was conducted in a 13 bed critical care unit at tertiary care teaching hospital in AL-Khobar, Saudi Arabia. All Patient greater or equal to 18 yrs of age, who were admitted to our intensive care units were included in the study.Pharmacist interventions were recorded electronically on daily bases.The electronic documentation system collected the following infor- mation, patient demographics and (age, gender, and weight, past medical history, home medication, allergies, type of intervention, andoutcome.Results: The study group consisted of 181 patients. Three hundred and three interventions were recorded during a period of 12 months. Therapeutic drug monitoring accounted for 66 (36 %) of totalpharmacist interventions, while 65 (35 %) was related to review &reconciling of medication history. Furthermore (17 %) of these inter- ventions were related to unnecessary medications mostly antibiotics. Interventions related to renal dosing adjustment accounted for 50(28 %) of interventions.Conclusions: The overall interventions identified in this study well demonstrate the impact of critical care pharmacist in improving pa- tient outcome and preventing drug related problems.

How can we reduce them?T. Hall, K. Wykes, J. Jack, W.C. Ngu, P. Morgan East Surrey Hospital, ICU, Redhill, UK Correspondence: T. Hall - East Surrey Hospital, ICU, Redhill, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A634 Introduction: Daily blood tests are a long running feature of ICU care, and are regarded as an essential diagnostic tool by medicalstaff, however they aren't without their drawbacks. The risk of iatro-genic anaemia is a very real one and there are significant costs in- volved in both equipment and staff time.1 With this in mind guidelines were drawn up to limit excessive blood tests in otherwisestable patients.Objectives: We audited adherence to these guidelines in 2015 finding 292 unnecessary vials of blood taken in a 20 bed unit. Guidelines were clarified and advertised on posters and then were-audited.Methods: In order to establish trends and to exclude stable post sur- gical patients we limited eligible patients to those who were on the unit for 3 days or more. A simple proforma was designed to recordwhich common blood tests had been performed, daily haematocritand haemoglobin (if tested), and any major change in overall condi- tion or events such as transfusions or surgery. On six randomly assigned days over a 2 month period, all eligible patients on the unithad a proforma filled retrospectively for all days up until their admis-sion to the unit, or up to seven days previously, whichever sooner. We also recorded if the patient had arterial or central access, as these facilitate obtaining samples for testing.Results: 70 patient days were audited across 10 individuals, with 339 tests ordered, 41 % of which were unnecessary, down from 46 % be- fore our intervention. Conclusions: While the bedspace posters had a modest effect, we are now enforcing the guidelines through the weekly medical andnursing teaching sessions, and also ensuring all requests for clinical reasons are agreed with the registrar or nurse in charge. We are also recommending removal or alteration of the \"Critical Care \"test set that is currently available from our electronic request- ing system in the hope that it will encourage more critical thinking about which tests are appropriate for the patient they are caring for. We aim to re-audit our practice within the next 6 months to ascertainthe impact of these changes. References 1: Goddard K, Austin SJ.

However, intervention over antimicrobial treatment of critical patients with hematologic disease is highly complicated Objectives: To evaluate a two years experience of an AMS program intervention in patients with hematologic disease admitted in an in-tensive care unit (ICU). Methods: We designed a quasi-experimental study. AMS strategies were put into practice during three years (January 2014-January2016) in collaboration with the ICU nosocomial infection controlteam. Antimicrobial treatment was revised twice a week. If any anti- microbial treatment modification was recommended in the AMS meeting, a face-to-face interview was held between AMS team andthe attending physician. ICU length of stay and ICU mortality ratewere compared with the same time period previous to AMS imple- mentation. Continuous and categorical variables were compared using T-student and Fischer exact test (Stata v.13.0).Results: 190 antimicrobials of 64 patients were evaluated in 69 AS team meetings [Age: Mean = 51.0 (SD = 13.8) years; APACHE II: Me- dian (RIQ) = 22 (19 -26)]. After ASM revision, there was 71 changes in antimicrobial prescriptions. Recommended amendments by the AMSteam were: stop antimicrobial treatment (32; 45.1 %), change in 23.9 %), change to a narrower spectrum antimicrobial (10; 14.1 %), monitoring drug concentrations (10; 14.1 %), and start a new antimicrobial (2; 3.0 %). Most of these recommendations(84.5 %) were accepted by the prescribing physician.No significant changes in ICU length of 4.39-8.45) % vs %; p = 0.827) or percentage of ICU readmis-sion (16.0 % vs 6.6 %; p = 0.051) were observed.Conclusions: AMS program focus in critical haematological patients has great potential to optimize and reduce antimicrobial consump- tion in the ICU. A637 Caregivers' perceptions towards communication with mechanicallyventilated patients: the results of a multicentre survey C.E. Ijssennagger 1, S. ten Hoorn1, J.M. van den Broek2, P.R. Tuinman1 Care, Intensive Care, Zaandam, Netherlands Correspondence: C.E. Ijssennagger - VU University Medical Center, Intensive Care, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A637 Introduction: Mechanically ventilated (MV) patients often experience difficulties with communication. It is well-studied that being non-vocal is experienced as distressing by most critically ill patients andcould result in severe emotional reactions (1). However, the opinions of health care professionals on this subject remain unknown. More- over, communication with ICU patients is becoming increasinglyimportant since ICU guidelines aim to reduce the use of sedatives,thus it is expected that more patients will be awake and able to communicate (2). Objectives: To investigate communication issues with MV patients as experienced by ICU health care professionals. The primary aim wasto quantify the extent of the problem and to determine its effect on patient care and job satisfaction. The secondary aim was to identify patient and health care factors associated with communication diffi-culties and to evaluate the preference and effectiveness of currentlyavailable communication methods. Methods: A multicentre survey study was conducted from December 2015 till January 2016. An online questionnaire consisting of 37 ques-tions was sent to nurses, residents and intensivists of seven ICUs inthe Netherlands. Results: Out of 961 caregivers, 297 participated (30.9 % response rate), of which 267 responses were included. Communication difficul-ties are experienced in 50.0 % of the interactions with MV patients,resulting in 42.5 % of the professionals to lose valuable time on daily basis. More than 55 % of the participants indicated to lose between 30-60 minutes during an average shift. Consequently, 44.0 % indi- cated that their job satisfaction is negatively affected, primarily withfeelings of unfulfillment (76.3 %) and frustration (70.8 %). To facilitate communication, 32.6 % reported to regularly use augmentative and alternative communication methods, but the most effective and pre-ferred method remains the use of basic gestures. In addition, almost50 % indicated to be dissatisfied with their personal communication skills with MV patients. Over 80 % of the caregivers have not been trained in communication with MV patients, while 72.0 % would liketo receive training in the future.Conclusions: In half of the interactions with MV patients, health care professionals experience communication difficulties. These difficulties frequently lead to negative effects on patient care and job satisfac-tion of ICU professionals. This further emphasizes the need for im-provements such as the development of communication protocols, skills training and continued research into new communication methods. References 1.

Elmenshawy Alexandria University, Critical Care Medicine, Alexandria, Egypt Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A638 Introduction: ICU is a high demand area in the hospital, with a large demand supply gap especially in limited resource countries. In addition, it requires a higher staffing ratio than rest of the hospital.Objectives: To explore the impact of multiple factors for increasing bed turnover during expanding newly developed ICU. Methods: Observation study during gradual opening of 18 beds medical/surgical ICU from June 2014 till March 2016. It is a part ofAlexandria University (primary and tertiary) hospitals covering 2 gov-ernorates receiving a lot of emergency patients. In September 2015, outreach critical care services were provided for early discharge of ICU patients but was inactive since April 2015 due to financial prob-lem. In September 2015 post-operative ICU was opened but the nurs-ing staff was recruited from general ICU. In January 2016, proactive ICU project was implemented which included reducing the time of delay of investigation for ICU patients, daily care plan for rapidstabilization, implementing end of life care decisions, and avoidingIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 327 of 607inappropriate antibiotic or medication use. In Feburary 2016, admin- istration increased ICU capacity with same number of nursing staff. Results: 347 patients were admitted to Smouha University ICU, from which 147 patients died (42.4 %). The mean mortality rate was43.9 % (28 -84.6 %), with mean APACHE II score of 23 (16 -30), and mean expected mortality 46.5 % (23.5-70.3). The relative mortality (actual/expected) ranged from 0.35 to 1.25 with mean 0.88 %. MeanBed occupancy ranged from 4 till 13 beds. After failure of outreachservice, bed turnover was similar (2.29 to 2.3). Before and after open- ing of post-operative ICU, The mortality rate of post-operative cases was higher in post-operative ICU than in general ICU (9.5 vs 2 %, p =0.019), with lower occupancy rate (4.5 vs 10 patients per month, p =0.277), and higher mean ICU stay (3.5 vs 1.2 days, p = 0.02). Before and after implementation of proactive ICU, the number of admissions significantly increased from 18 to 33 (p = 0.003), insignificantly higheroccupancy rate from 1.8 to 2.8 (p = 0.345), and significantly de-creased waiting time for ICU admission from 38 to 6 hours (p < 0.001). However ICU complication increased; unexpected cardiac ar- rest from 7.5 to 18.5/1000 patient days (p = 0.002), unplanned extu-bation from 21 to 35/1000 ventilator days (p = 0.305), deep veinthrombosis from 0 to 4.7 % (p = 0.259) and pneumothorax from 3 to 2 % together with increased mortality and relative mortality insignifi- cantly (45.7 to 59 % and 0.89 to 1.13 respectively)Conclusions: From multiple efforts to increase ICU turnover, end of life care decisions and proactive ICU seems most effective, however the expense of increasing nursing and doctor load must be weighted to avoid iatrogenic complications. Also diverting post-operative pa-tients to specialized ICU needed more nurses without better patientsoutcome.

Results: The initial notes review showed that 32 % of heights and 24 % weights were documented. The majority of respondents to ourinternal survey agreed that using accurate values was important, that we should define and standardise how we do this and that there was a definite need to improve performance (4). A small MDT groupcollaborated to define best practice and it was agreed that a stand-ard protocol for measurement and documentation of ABW and IBW would be implemented. Conclusion There is an evident problem with consistency of docu- mentation for safe values of ABW and IBW within NUHCC. We havedefined our standard and are excited about implementing and em- bedding excellent practice as a collaborative effort. We look forward to sharing the data from the first steps of our journey to the ESICMconference. References 1. Kishen R, Blakeley S, Bray K.

Early identification of patients at risk might facilitate im- provements in quality of care. Objective: To determine risk factors associated with short-term hos- pital outcome (unplanned ICU readmission and unexpected death onthe ward).Methods: Prospective cohort study from August 2014 to May 2015 performed at Hospital S\u00edrio Liban\u00eas (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil). During this period, we analyzed 527 patients who were admitted in our ICU anddischarged alive. We used univariate and multivariate analysis toidentify risk factors associated with latter ICU readmission or unex- pected ward death in the same hospitalization period. Results: Forty seven patients (8.9 %) were readmitted after ICU dis- charge and further forty seven died in the ward. Patients who hadunexpected outcomes were older compared to those with successful outcomes (age 72 \u00b1 17 vs 66 \u00b1 18 respectively, p = 0.003), were sicker (SAPS 3 of 53 [IQR 43 -60] vs 38 [29 -49] respectively, p < 0.001), male sex (62.8 % vs 47.1 % respectively, p = 0.006), had a non-surgical rea-son for hospitalization (75.5 % vs 45 % respectively, p < 0.001), more frequently came from the ward (21.3 % vs 7.6 % respectively, p < 0.001), were less frequently independent for daily activities (54.3 %vs 76.7 % respectively, p < 0.001), had sepsis (39.4 % vs 11.8 % re-spectively, p < 0.001), required mechanical ventilation (44.7 % vs 14.1 % respectively, p < 0.001), vasoactive drugs (54.3 % vs 24.2 %Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 328 of 607respectively, p < 0.001) and dialysis (16 % vs 1.2 % respectively, p < 0.001), had higher SOFA score both at ICU admission (4 [2 -7] vs 1 [0-3] respectively, p < 0.001) and (2 [1 -4] vs 1 [0 -2] re- spectively, p < higher values at admis-sion (5.8 mg/dL [1.9 - 15.6] vs 3.6 [0.8 - 0.001) and lactate values [1.1 2.5] respect- ively, p = 0.03), and higher Sabadell score at discharge (1 [1 -2] vs 0 [0-1] respectively, p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, only sepsis and Sabadell score were independent risk factors for worse out- comes (AUC 0.73; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Sabadell score at ICU discharge might be a promising subjective tool for hospital outcomes. References 1. Rodrigues CM, Pires EMC, Feliciano JPO, et al.

Little hasbeen described on this evaluation in low-income countries.Objectives: To describe the results of six years from a follow-up out- patient Clinic evaluating adult patients that survived to admission to ICU, three months after discharge. Methods: Prospective cohort study evaluating adult patients that sur- vived after admission to a general ICU of a University Hospital in South- ern Brazil. It was included patients that stayed > 24 h in ICU and >18 years old. All survivors were contacted by Clinic, and only were ex-cluded that patients that did not attend to the Clinic. Socio- demographic and medical data were collected by searching the med- ical record. For the psychological evaluation it was used the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale - (HADS) and the Impact of Event Scale- Revised - (IES-R). It was analyzed weight and height on hospital admis- sion and discharge, as well as at the office visit. Muscle strength was measured by Medical Research Council (MRC) scale. Spirometry was per- formed by using One-flow device, with standard procedures. Results: During the period of the study (jul-2008 to dec-2014), 2615 patients were admitted to adult ICU, and 1845 were discharged alivefrom hospital. Of them, 696 were evaluated at the outpatient multi-professional Post-ICU Clinic three months after discharge. 62.9 % of the patients were male, mean age 43.1 years, mean APACHE 20.4. The ICU admission was due to trauma (42.1 %), medical conditions(26.2 %) and postoperative (31.7 %). Mean ICU length of stay was10.3 days. The most of the patients (83.3 %) required mechanical ventilation. In outpatient evaluation, 94.6 % were on oral feeding, mean weight loss of 11.7 % during hospital length of stay, and amean weight gain of 9.1 % after discharge. 31.8 % had reducedmuscle strength, with 4.9 % hemiparesis/hemiplegia and 5.7 % mod- erate/severe tetraparesia or tetraplegia. Spirometry was abnormal in 49 %, being more common obstructive disorders (37.8 %). At psycho-logical evaluation, 45.2 % showed emotional disorders: anxiety(30.6 %); depression (21.4 %) and PTSD (19.5 %). 47,7 % had a family income lesser than US$550.00/month. It was found significant social and economical consequences for the most of the survivors and theirfamilies.Conclusions: A large proportion of patients had physical, social and psychological complications three months after ICU discharge. Thus, early identification and appropriate treatment of these complicationsmay be beneficial. The social and economical impact of ICU stay is tobe determined in low-income populations. A642 Examining fatigue in ICU survivors: validity and reliability of a modified version of FACIT-F scale S. Spadaro, M. Capuzzo, and Experimental Medicine, Ferrara, Italy Correspondence: S. Spadaro - University of Ferrara, Department of Morphology, Surgery and Experimental Medicine, Ferrara, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A642 Introduction: A recent survey on the long-term complications re- ported by the General Practitioners of 1-year ICU survivorsshowed that chronic fatigue was among the complications most often reported [1]. One of the instruments proposed to assess fa- tigue is the Functional Assessment Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), a 13-item scale that has been validated in asample of the general USA population [2]. Al-shair et al. [3] who used FACIT-F (13-FACIT-F) questionnaire COPD 9-item FACIT-F (9-FACIT-F) for thesepatients. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare reliability and val- idity of 13-FACIT-F and 9-FACIT-F in a group of ICU survivors assessedone year after hospital discharge. Methods: The study was performed in 56 consecutive adult ICU pa- tients staying in ICU for at least 72 hours, and able to co-operate atthe time of ICU discharge. We excluded patients with pre-existing cognitive deficits, or resident more than 30 km from the hospital. One year after hospital discharge, the patients who consented cameto the hospital. An investigator administered by direct interview thefollowing instruments to the patients who consented: 13-FACIT-F, modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea scale and the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 (SF-36). An additional ques-tion asked whether the patient's fatigue was the same, improved, orworsened in comparison with the pre-ICU time. Statistical analysis was performed using Cronbach alpha for reliability, Spearman correl- ation between FACIT-F scales and both mMRC and Vitality of SF-36for validity, and Mann -Whitney test in patients with same/improved, or worsened fatigue for discriminative ability of both 13-FACIT-F and 9-FACIT-F scales. Results: 13-FACIT-F had higher internal consistency = 0.813) com- pared to 9-FACIT-F ( = 0.654). The correlation between the original and the modified scales was excellent (Table 54). The correlations be- tween both scales and mMRC, and Vitality of SF-36 were all statisti-cally significant (p < 0.001) (Table 54). Both 13-FACIT-F and 9-FACIT-F values were statistically significantly different in patients with im- proved/not changed and worsened fatigue in comparison with oneyear before (Table 55). Conclusions: Both 13-item and 9-item FACIT-F scales demonstrate convergence with other conceptually relevant patient-reported out- comes, namely mMRC and Vitality of SF-36. The present study dem-onstrates that 13-FACIT-F and 9-FACIT-F have a similar ability indiscriminating between ICU survivors with improved/not changed and worsened fatigue at one year. However, the original 13-item FACIT-F scale may have the advantage to allow comparison with thegeneral population. References 1. Steenbergen S et al. BMC Anesthesiol 15:142, 2015.2. Cella D et al.

UCIP, Santo Hospital Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A643 Introduction: Follow up outpatient clinic after intensive care (ICU) for has been pointed as a quality indicator of ICU care. Objectives: The objective of this study is to describe the outcomes of the ICU outpatient clinic in terms of clinical management. Methods: Prospective, cohort study, over 4 years (2011 -2014), at a 12-bed mixed ICU, form a tertiary care, university affiliated hospital. Results: During the study period 1482 patients were admitted into the ICU and 566 were observed at the outpatient clinic. 555 patients were able to answer to the screening questionnaires and are analyzed. Of these 50 % (277) reported new complains and 30 % (168) had to be oriented for specific interventions and 6 % (33) to more than one. Of these 168 patients: 29 % (n = 48) were oriented to Psychiatry; 15 % (n = 26) to Internal Medicine; 10 % (n = 16) to the Primary Care Physician; 8 % (n = 14) to General Surgery; 8 % (n = 13) to Cardiology; 7 % (n = 12) to Physiotherapy, and 23 % (39) others. When observed at the outpatient clinic only 230 (44 %) had resumed previous normal activity (34 did not answer the question). Of the 291 that did not, 197 (71 %) assumed to be related to the ICU. No signifi- cant differences were observed concerning the timing of the out- patient clinic observation (<2 months, 2 -6 months and > 6 months after hospital discharge, p = 0.147) and resuming previous activity. Of those that were still not able to return to previous activity (n = 291), 194 (67 %) reported new complain and 85 (44 %) needed refer- ral for specific therapeutic approaches. Conclusions: The importance of the ICU follow up clinic is reinforced by the significant proportion of patients in whom new problems are identified requiring specific referral for treatment. The impact of the outpatient clinic in the subsequent quality of life of those patients re- mains to be determined. We propose for those in whom new clinical problems are addressed a second observation to evaluate its efficacy and impact. References 1.

Paratz - Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A644 Introduction: Patients who survive an episode of post admission to intensive care for sepsis syndromes have been found to have poor quality of life, physical and psychological problems and a high rate of recurring illness or mortality in the first year. Follow-up clinics have been instituted for general intensive care patients but the evi- dence as to efficacy is sparse at present and there has been no clinic specifically for survivors of sepsis. Objectives: The aim of this trial is to investigate if targeted screening and appropriate intervention to these subjects post hospital dis- charge can result in an improved quality of life, decreased mortality, decreased readmission to hospital and/or decreased use of health resources. Methods: Patients post sepsis syndrome in intensive care and receiv- ing respiratory support for greater than 48 hours will be randomized to one of two groups. The intervention group will attend an out- patient clinic two monthly for six months and receive screening and targeted intervention. Screening will include physical measures (strength, balance) psychosocial measures (depression, anxiety, PTSD), cognitive measures, pain, nutrition or sleep problems. The usual care group will remain under the care of their physician. The primary outcome will be short form (36) health survey (SF36v2\u00d4), re- admission to hospital, mortality in the first 12 months, and use of health resources in the first year. A sub group in a rural setting will be assessed by telemedicine. Results: Twenty patients (9 intervention, 11 usual care) have been randomized. Patients randomised to the intervention group report aTable 54 (abstract A642). Cronbach alpha Table 55 (abstract A642).

Pereira - Hospital Pedro Hispano, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A645 Introduction: Surviving the ICU is only the beginning of getting life back. The majority of ICU survivors experience immediate and fre-quently persistent physical, mental and cognitive impairments that compose post-intensive care syndrome (PICS)[1-3]. The exact prevalence of PICS is unrevealed, but it is estimated thatmore than half of critical care survivors develop at least one symp-tom throughout their recovery. Understanding who are the patients more likely to develop PICS is a key issue. Objectives: This study intends to determine the prevalence of PICS in one Portuguese ICU, to characterise this population and identify risk factors to the development of this syndrome. Methods: We performed a prospective cohort study from January 2013 to February 2015. All ICU survivors that were admitted to our unit during two or more days were included. In the first 24 hours of admission patients were screened for the risk to de-velop physical and non-physical components of PICS. The pres-ence of PICS was assessed at four time points: at ICU discharge, one week after, at hospital discharge and three months after ICU discharge. Additionally, we recorded clinical data on: patients'demographics, type of admission, simplified acute physiologyscore (SAPS II), length of ICU and total hospital stay, length of sedation and mechanical ventilation. Results: We enrolled 355 patients with a median age of 63 years and a predominance of males (62 %). At ICU admission 87.6 % of the pa-tients had some risk factor for PICS. Throughout time PICS was iden- tified in 186 (54 %) patients at ICU discharge, 148 (58 %) one week after discharge, 78 (55 %) at hospital discharge and on 106 (43 %)patients three months after ICU. At ICU discharge, physical compo-nents of PICS were more frequent, and at three month follow up non-physical components were more common. Patients with higher SAPS score, longer length of ICU and hospital stay and more ventila-tion and sedation days were more prone to have PICS at ICU dis-charge. These variables were independent risk actors to the development of PICS. At three months follow-up, these same vari- ables, except SAPS II score, were still risk factors of PICS.Conclusions: PICS is a major concern in nowadays intensive care units (ICU), reflecting a drift from the original focus on organ supportto patient support. Interventions in reducing the absolute number of ventilation and sedation days might contribute to reduce the burden of PICS. References [1] Needham D., Davidson J., Cohen H., et al. (2012).

Cardoso, Santo Hospital Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A646 Introduction: Depression has been associated to ICU stay in a fair pro- portion of patients. But most studies rely solely on the outpatient clinicscreening after ICU discharge, without considering previous psycho-pathology of the patients or specific risk factors, like ICU memories. Objectives: To determine the prevalence of depression after ICU dis- charge in patients with and without a previous diagnosis of psycho-pathology and its association with memories from the ICU admission.Methods: Prospective cohort study of all patients seen at the out- patient clinic, discharged between January 2011 and December 2014, from a 12-bed, mixed ICU, at a tertiary care university affiliated hospital.The ICU memory questionnaire and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)were the tools used, depression was assumed if the BDI score was higher than 16. With depression has the dependent variable: age, sex, previous psychopathy, acute psychiatric event, previous neurologic dis-order, acute neurologic event and the presence of memories werestudied as risk factors, through logistic regression. Results: During the study period 1482 patients were discharged from the ICU, 635(43 %) died before the outpatient clinic appointment and566(67 %) attended the clinic, of these 555 filled the BDI and 530 theICU memory questionnaire. These patients (n = 555) had a mean \u00b1 SD age of 58 \u00b1 17 years; 341(61 %) were male; 157(28 %) had a previous diagnose of a psychopathology disorder : 79(14 %) alcoholism,55(35 %) depression, 16(10 %) psychosis and 7(4 %) drug abuse werethe more frequent, 13(8 %) had more than one; 32(6 %) were admitted to ICU due to an acute psychiatric event, only 2 patients without a pre- vious diagnose were admitted with an acute psychiatric event. Theprevalence of depression in the group with a previous history of psy-chopathology was significantly higher than in the group without: 26 %(n = 40) vs 16 %(n = 63), p = 0.008. In the univariate analysis vari- ables significantly associated with depression after ICU were: previouspsychopathology (OR1.82), acute psychiatric event (OR3.79) and pres-ence of memories from ICU admission (OR0.66). In the final model those retained has independent risk factors were: acute psychiatric event [adjusted OR(95 % CI) = 4.30(2.01-9.21)] and presence of memor-ies from the ICU admission [adjusted OR(95 % CI) = 0.63(0.40-0.98)].Conclusions: Depression after ICU is more prevalent among patients that have previous psychopathology, recalling that the ICU stay is as- sociated with a reduced risk for after ICU depression. We suggestthat when patients are admitted to ICU the relatives fill in a question-naire about the previous cognitive, psychologic and functional status of the patient in order to allow clinicians to determine the true im- pact of ICU care. The elaboration of a diary to decrease post-traumatic stress disorder following ICU has already been study, but itwould be interesting to see if that would have a positive impact in the prevalence of depression after ICU care.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 331 of 607A647 Emotional and cognitive sequelae of medical-surgical ICU care L. Karnatovskaia, K. Philbrick, G. Ognjen, M. ClarkMayo Clinic, Rochester, USACorrespondence: L. Karnatovskaia - Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A647 Introduction: Many intensive care unit (ICU) patients experience symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress along with cognitive impairment and physical debility. This combination of symptoms has been classified as post-intensive care syndrome(PICS). Over half of ICU survivors are reported to have significantpsychiatric symptoms which appear to diminish little over time. Post-ICU intervention efforts may fail due to delayed initiation, i.e., following hospital discharge after patients' perceptions oftheir ICU experience has potentially solidified. Currently work isbeing done to prevent physical aspects of PICS via early physical rehabilitation while still in the ICU. However, there are no evi- dence based practical interventions to prevent or treat the psy-chological and cognitive consequences of the ICU stay. It is alsonot known if there may be categories of patients who are more susceptible to PICS, and would therefore benefit most from tai- lored treatments.Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of psychocognitive morbidity among patients across six adult ICUs. Methods: Within 96 hours of dismissal from the ICU, eligible pa- tients completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale(HADS; scores 8 indicating significant symptoms of anxiety or depression), Impact of Events Scale-Revised (IES-R; scores 1.6 in- dicating significant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symp- toms), and Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Blind (MoCA-blind;scores < 18 indicating cognitive impairment). Inclusion: >18 of >48 on the 6-item Cognitive Screener. Exclusion: admitted to the ICU for suicide attempt; known prior cognitive impairment/de-mentia; prior diagnosis of PTSD; non-English speaking.Results: 107 patients completed the assessment. Table 56illustrates prevalence of psychocognitive symptoms by the ICU type. Conclusions: There was a high prevalence of symptoms of de- pression (range 17-69 %), anxiety (range 18-58 %) and PTSD(range 18-58 %). In terms of predictors of distress, patients in the heme-onc/transplant ICU ha dam u c hl o w e rp r e v a l e n c eo f symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD compared to pa-tients in the other ICU units. Whether these patients experiencethe ICU differently by virtue of the chronicity of their diseases and the contextual circumstance s of their ICU admissions invites further study. There was also a high level of cognitive impair-ment across the ICUs (range 45-83 %). Clearly more needs to belearned about patient and unit factors that are related to psy- chological difficulties, and tailo red interventions will need to be appropriate for individuals with cognitive impairments.

Provent score at day 21 has been proven effective as a prognostic index of mortality one year after prolonged admissionin ICU in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation(over 20 days). Objective: Assesment of Provent Score as prognostic score in ICU mortality in patients with prolonged ICU stay (over 20 days).Methods: Prospective descriptive study. During two years, we in- cluded all patients with more than 20 days of stay in a medical- surgical ICU. Previous informed consent, we collected demographics data, diagnosis, severity index (APACHE II and SOFA scores), Proventscore variables at day 21 of ICU admission (age, platelets < 150.000/mm 3,, need of vasoactive support and renal replacement therapy), PaO2/FiO2 at day 21, mortality and ICU stay. Data is expressed as number and percentage; statistical analysis wasperformed with Chi-square test.Results: A total of 58 patients with prolonged ICU admission were included. We did not find differences in age, sex, comorbidity or severity of illness at admission between survivors and deceasedin ICU. At day 21, 33 % of the patients needed vasoactive sup-port (72 % of deceased and 15 % of the survivors, p < 0.001), 22 % had thrombocytopenia (50 % of deceased and 10 % survi- vors, p = 0.002), 22 % needed renal replacement therapy (33 % ofdeceased and 17 % survivors, p = 0.195) and 29.3 % presentedPaO 2 / FiO 2 less or equal to 200 mmHg (55.6 % of deceased and 16.7 % survivors, p = 0.003). ICU mortality was 31 %. Conclusions: High Provent Score (4 -5) or PaO 2 / FiO 2 below 200 mmHg.at day 21 of admission is associated with increased intra-ICU mortal- ity in patients with prolonged admission .

A high level of uncertainty exists regarding to prog-nostication of outcomes in these patients. Chronical critical illness isusually considered when invasive mechanical ventilation is pro- longed for at least 21 days after acute illness. Objectives: To study the ability of Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and Simplified Acute PhysiologyScore (SAPS) II to predict outcome in our chronically critically ill patients. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of patients ad- mitted to our medical-surgical ICU in the last 5 years. Differ-ences in basal characteristics and outcomes and data regarding APACHE II and SAPS II predictive value were studied in two co- hort of patients according to the need for more than 21 daysof mechanical. For univariate analysis Chi-square test, t-Studentand U-Mann -Whitney test was used. Receiver Operating Charac- teristic (COR) curves was used to study predictive ability of scores.Results: A total of 2671 patients were admitted. Of them, 85 required more than 21 days of mechanical ventilation (chronic). Chronic patients were younger (65 (51.5-73) vs 68 (54 -77); p 0.036), had higher APACHE II (21 (15.25-25) vs 16 (12 -22); p < 0.001) and SAPS II (48.5 (37 -56) vs 40 (30 -53); p < 0.001), same Glasgow scale at admission and longer ICU stay (38.5 (30 -52.5) vs 4 (2 -6); p < 0.001) and hospital stay (56.5 (37.25-80.5) vs 10 (5-18); p < 0.001) Mortality was higher in prolonged mechanical ventilation patients (33.3 vs 18.7; p 0.002). Chronic patients hadhigher incidence of inmunodepression, COPD, neoplasia and nutrition at admission (statiscally significant). Required urgent sur- gery in higher proportion (22.4 vs 11.6 %; p 0.004), more renalsupport (30.6 vs 5.7 %; p < 0.001) and more parenteral nutrition(34.1 vs 7.3 %; p < 0.001) Admission from ward was more fre- quent in chronic patients (56.5 vs 41.1 %; p < 0.001). Table 58 shows ROC curves data. AUC differences resulted slightly lower inmedical patients [AUC 0.724 0 -006) vs 0.816 (0.793-0.838; p < 0.001)] and were more pronounced in surgical patients [AUC 0.641 (0.415-0.867; p 0.270) in chronic vs 0.833 (0.789-0.876; p < 0.001)].Conclusions: APACHE II and SAPS II showed worse predictive ac- curacy for hospital mortality in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after the acute phase, especially in surgical admissions.

Cakin - Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A650 Introduction: Liver transplantation patients generally are followed up in intensive care unit (ICU) for postoperative period. Prognosis ofthose patients can be predicted with some scoring systems.Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prognostic effi- cacy of physiological scoring systems obtained at first postoperative day after liver transplantation on ICU stay, mortality and mechanicalventilation(MV) duration.Methods: Postoperative first day acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Model of End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores, ICU stayand early (28 days) of the liver transplant patients admitted betweenthe years 2010 -2016 to Akdeniz University ICU were evaluated, retro- spectively. Ethic consent was obtained from local ethic committee. Results: Record files of 119 liver transplant patients admitted to ICU during study period were evaluated. Postoperative early ICU mortal-ity was 15.1 %. Mean MV duration, APACHE II score, SOFA score, MELD score were found 5 hours (1 -168), 9(3 -29), 6(2 -16) and 18(5 - 31), respectively. APACHE and SOFA scores of the patients whose ICUstay were longer than 35 hours were significantly higher (p < 0.05).APACHE and SOFA scores were inversely correlated with early ICU mortality (p < 0.001). MELD score did not have significant prognostic value on ICU stay and early ICU mortality. Independent risk factors ef-fective on mortality were evaluated by logistic regression test indicat-ing APACHE and blood urea nitrogen(BUN) value as independent risk factors in terms of mortality. Conclusions: There are conflicting results in terms of availability of generally used physiological scoring systems for predicting the prog-nosis after liver transplantation(3). Significant number of studies has results confirming the prognostic value of SOFA, APACHE II and MELD scores in ICU stay, MV duration and mortality. In our study,early mortality and ICU stay were higher in the liver transplant pa-tients who have higher APACHE and SOFA scores obtained at first day of ICU admission, postoperatively(2,3). APACHE II and SOFA scor- ing systems were found to have prognostic efficacy on ICU stay andearly mortality after liver transplantation(3). However, we found nocorrelation between MELD score and mortality(1). The discrepancy may result from the quality of liver graft as 70 % of the donation was performed from live organ donors in our study. References 1- Oberkofler CE, Dutkowski P, et al.

ROC curves for APACHE II and SAPS II AUC Page 333 of 607Introduction: Several prognostic systems have been tested to predict early in-hospital mortality after liver transplantation, showing moder- ate performance. The recently developed Acute Physiology andChronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV score and Simplified AcutePhysiology Score (SAPS) 3 now include liver transplantation as a diagnostic category. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the performance of APACHE IV, SAPS 3, APACHEII, MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP scores inpredicting early in-hospital mortality in liver transplant patients. Methods: We studied 590 adult (age 18 years) patients who had undergone living donor or deceased donor liver transplantation be-tween October 2010 and September 2014. APACHE II, APACHE IVand SAPS 3 were recorded on ICU admission after liver transplant- ation. MELD, MELD-Na, and CTP scores were calculated using values before liver transplantation.Results: The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 2.9 %. Hosmer- Lemeshow statistics showed good calibration for all 6 prognostic models. The AUC was 0.83 for APACHE IV, 0.78 for SAPS for APA- CHE II, for MELD, and 0.68 for CTP score.Conclusions: The APACHE IV score and SAPS 3 in predicting in- hospital mortality after liver transplantation showed revealed gener- ally good discrimination and calibration. The overall discrimination and calibration of APACHE IV were similar to those of all othermodels except CTP score for predicting hospital mortality. References 1.

Operative outcomes of adult living donor liver transplantation and deceased donor liver transplantation: a systematicreview of SAPS 3 and SOFA in the prognosis of cardiac patients admitted to Brazilian intensive Brazil;2Universidade - UNIFACS, N\u00facleo de Pesquisa Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A652 Introduction: The scores have been widely used in the Intensive Care and Cardiac Units. The SOFA initially used for the daily assessment oforgan dysfunction in septic patients, was subsequently validated forserious patients in general, as a way of assessing daily dysfunction. The prognosis system SAPS3 (Simplified Acute Physiology Score 3) aims to establish a predictive mortality rate for patients admitted toIntensive Care Units (ICU).Objectives: To evaluate the accuracy of the SAPS 3 and SOFA scores in the prognosis of cardiac patients admitted to the ICU of a general hospital in northeast region of Brazil.Methods: Prospective cohort study placed in a general ICU. In the study were included 54 patients with cardiac disease of 314 patients admitted patients to general ICU, from August 2015 and March 2016. All the patients were assessed using the SAPS 3 (Global Equation andCentral & South American Equation) and SOFA scoring systems. Lo-gistic regressions analysis was used to calculate the sensitivity, speci- ficity and accuracy as well as the OR probability of mortality. The ability to predict mortality was performed with ROC curves. The dif-ferences between observed-to-predicted mortality were analyzedwith the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Results: The study population had the following general characteris- tics: age 67 \u00b1 15.3 years, men 51.9 %, with a median time of 6 daysof hospitalization (IQR = 2.5-10.5). The admission reason was clinical in 85.2 % of patients (15.4 % NSTEMI, STEMI 3.9 %, 7.7 % UA, 23.1 % Heart Failure, Acute lung edema 11.5 %). The median (in points) inSAPS 3 score was 43 (CI = 38.0-49.8) and SOFA was 0 (IQR = 0 -3.0) and the area under the ROC curve was 0.93 (CI 95 % = 0.85-1.00) and 0.95 (CI 95 % = 0.89-1.00), respectively. Calibration was confirmed by the Hosmer-Lemeshow test for SAPS 3-X2 = 0.1565 df: 8 (p = 0.99).Sensitivity to the SAPS 3 score and SOFA was 81.82 % and 100 %,and the specificity of the scores was 94.12 % and 79.41 % respect- ively. The corresponding negative predictive value to scores SAPS 3 and SOFA was 94.12 % (CI 95 % = 76.81-99.28) and 100 % (CI 95 % =86.03-100.00). The corresponding positive predictive value to scoresSAPS 3 was 84.12 % (CI 95 % = 53.45-97.72). Conclusions: The results showed that the scores can be effective in the prognostic assessment of cardiac patients admitted to a generalICU, with good calibration and adequate discrimination value. A653 SAPS 3 score and grace index. Mortality calibration analysis in acute coronary sindrome patients admitted in ICU. Correlation between both scoresJ. Castellanos Ortega Hospital Universitario y Polit\u00e9cnico La Fe, ICU, Valencia, Spain Correspondence: J. Cebri\u00e1n Domenech - Hospital Universitario y Polit\u00e9cnico La Fe, ICU, Valencia, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A653 Introduction: Saps 3 is widely used in intensive care units (ICU). How- ever their use among the acute coronary patiens remains controversial.Objectives: To compare, in mortality calibration terms, a general ICU se- verity index (Saps 3) with a specific one (Grace) designed for coronary pa- tients in a population of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) admitted in ourICU. In addition to build a correlation equation between both scores.Methods: During the period 1/1/2015 to 30/9/2015 a total of 287 pa- tients with ACS were admitted in our ICU. Predicted Saps 3 mortality is systematically recorded in our electronic clinical record. Grace scorewas obtained by retrospective carefully revision of medical records ac-cording to their authors recommendations. Saps 3 death risk was de- rived by Mediterranean country index equation while Grace death risk was obtained from original score variables by using Granger's regres-sion coefficients. We compared in-hospital observed mortality with the-oretical predicted mortality for both scores. We have used a goodness of fit test. We used Pearson's R analysis for correlation purposes. Results: Mean age was 63.2 years (SD 13.6) and 24 % were women. Mean Saps 3 score was 44.1 (SD 7.8) while mean Grace index was152.8 (DE 37.6) Estimated mortality by Saps 3 and Grace were 12.0 % and 5.1 % respectively. Observed in-ICU mortality was 3.1 % (95 % CI 1.7-5.9) and in-hospital 5.2 % (95 % CI 3.2-8.4) Regarding correlationanalysis Grace and Saps 3 scores are linked by the following equa-tion: Grace = 27.01 + 2.86 x Saps 3 (R 2= 0,34; p < 0.001) . Conclusions: Mortality of ACS patients in our ICU is clearly overesti- mated by Saps 3 score. It seems more appropriate to use the Gracespecific index in this subgroup of our case-mix. It ist feasible the useof a correlation equation between both scores. Airway management in ICU A654\"Airway aware \"measuring and improving multi-disciplinary team awareness of a safe response to airway and tracheostomy crises across critical care units in two British university teaching hospitals C. Forbes, H. PrescottNottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Adult Critical Care,Nottingham, UK Correspondence: C. Forbes - Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, Adult Critical Care, Nottingham, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A654Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 334 of 607Introduction: The use of temporary tracheostomies to avoid complica- tions of prolonged intubation and facilitate respiratory weaning is a well recognised cornerstone of critical care medicine, but their insertionand subsequent management is not without risk. Tracheostomy dis-placement is one of the most serious and frequent of all airway events in critical care and is associated with 50 % of airway related deaths in this setting 1,2. As such a timely emergency action plan is a necessity for critical care areas1,2,3. Objectives: We aimed to carry out a service improvement project to improve timely escalation of patients with dislodged tracheostomiesto senior airway trained doctors. The project was carried out at two sites: Queen\u00b4s Medical Centre (QMC) and Nottingham City Hospital (NCH) of Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, UK. Methods: A rapid cycle audit was undertaken by the authors whereby staff awareness of the local emergency airway protocol was audited on a shift-by-shift basis. All non-airway trained clinical staff were askedhow best to get an airway expert to urgently attend a patient with adislodged tracheostomy. Answers were recorded and at the same time staff were reminded of the local protocol. Other education measures undertaken concurrently included departmental emails, posters and re-minders during resuscitation training. A Statistical Process Control chartof percentage correct answers per shift was plotted. Results: Over both sites an improvement in compliance was observed over a 4 month period. Mean compliance for the first 3 audit cycles atQMC and NCH was 38.47 % and 24.2 % respectively versus mean compli-ance for the final 3 audit cycles of 97.23 % and 50.53 % respectively. At QMC, use of posters after 3 months saw a marked improvement in com- pliance with all 8 audit cycles undertaken after distribution of the postersexceeding the upper control limit of the preceding 3 months' worth ofdata and 4 of those 8 cycles seeing greater than 90 % compliance. Conclusions: Improved awareness of the escalation protocol over the 4 month audit period was reflected in its increased utilisation. Use ofvarious educational tools achieved varying results, the most effectivebeing distribution of posters. There is ongoing scope for staff educa- tion in order to consistently achieve greater than 90 % compliance at both sites and we would recommend re-audit within 6 months. References 1.

A655 Ideal length of oral endo-tracheal tube (ETT) for intubated patientsin Asian population: comparison to (Jurong Healthcare), Intensive Care, Singapore, Singapore;2Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (Jurong Healthcare), Clinical Research Unit, Singapore, SingaporeCorrespondence: A. Lal - Ng Teng Fong General Hospital (Jurong Healthcare), Intensive Care, Singapore, Singapore Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A655 Introduction: The length of oral ETT in males and females has been recommended as 23 cm and 21 cm respectively from corner of mouth to above carina, standards described for Western population.Caucasian population tends to be taller than Asian population. We,thus retrospectively analysed whether it is true in Asian population of smaller stature and whether there is any correlation between height of the patient to the ideal length of oral ETT.Objectives: To validate the ideal length of oral ETT in Asian Popula- tion compared to Western standards.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the data for patient episodes, who had oral ETT inserted in the Intensive care unit of Jurong Healthcare, Singapore (Alexandra Hospital) from April 2011 till June2015. The variables analysed were demographics, height and idealbody weight of the patient, length of oral ETT and chest X rays (for confirmation of position of ETT). Results: There were 923 incidences of oral cuffed ETT insertion above the age of 18 years in 750 patients and their intubation records wereanalysed. The median length of oral ETT was 22.2 cm in 600 males(SD 1.26)and mean length in 323 females was 21 cm (SD = 1.46).The mean lengthin all three ethnic groups of Chinese, Malay and Indians was 22 cm.The median ETT depth for ICU male patients with acceptable dis- tance from carina (2 -5 cm) was 22 cm, (p < 0.0001) different from 23-24 cm but was similar in females at 21 cm (p < 0.66). Conclusions: The local population in Singapore is representative of 3 major ethnic groups (Malay, Chinese and Indians) which covers al- most 2/3 population of Asia. They are generally of shorter stature in comparison to western population especially Caucasians. It has beenwell documented that the ETT moves downwards towards carina byat least 2 cm in flexion of neck and upwards by 2 cm in extension. This plays an important role while securing ETTs especially in Inten- sive care patients, as they tend to be intubated for an average of 3 -5 days and require lot of movements during day to day care. Either se-curing the tube too low or too high can cause either right sided endo-bronchial intubation or high risk of accidental extubation re- spectively. These inadvertent impediments predispose already critic-ally ill patients to significant risks and complications. We suggest thatfemales and males in Asian population especially in South East Asia should have their endo-tracheal tubes secured at corner of mouth by at least one cm less in comparison to western population.

Mu\u00f1oz Garach, O. Moreno Romero, R. Ramirez Puerta, F. Acosta Mu\u00f1oz Garach - Complejo Hospitalario de Granada, ICU, Granada, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A656 Introduction: The patient with a tracheostomy tube may experience dysphagia. The physiologic factors that may contribute to the dys- phagia include reduced laryngeal elevation, reduced pharyngeal sen- response, and disuse atrophy o laryngeal musculature. A tracheostomy tube with a cuff may be placed to pre- vent aspiration of secretions, food, and gastric contents. However, a patient may still aspirate some food with a fully inflated cuff due to severe dysphagia or a tracheostomy site placed too high. The identi- fication and management of aspiration in the patient with a trache- ostomy is important and often implies difficulties and challenging clinical decisions. Objetive: Comparation of the Extended Evan's Blue Dye (EEBD) test in predicting artifical airway dysphagia versus Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing (FEES) as the gold standard. Methods: We prospectively registered 26 tracheotomized patients due to difficulty in weaning. First we used the EEBD test (2 ml blue Evans administered with a spoon in middle third of the tongue), then we observed wheather aspiration signs appear (early/late cough, symptoms of asphyxia, or more than 3 percentage points basal pulse oximetry desaturations), and the posible blue stained secre- tions suctioned through the tracheostomy tube. Simultaneously the FEES was performed, watching directely all the posibilities of penetration and or blue Evans aspiration (Fig. 77). The validity and performance enhancement were calculated, and the ROC curve was made with 95 % CI. The study was approved by the hospital ethics committee. Results: 26 patients underwent FEES + EEBD: 7 had FEES without as- piration and a negative EEBD. 19 had FEES with aspiration, 16 were positive and 3 negative EEBD. The validity and performance enhance- ment indexes are described in Fig. 78, with an area under curve of 0.92 \u00b1 0.54 (95%CI: 0.82-1.00) and p = 0.006 (Fig. 79). Conclusions 1- The EEBD is a significant and simple diagnostic screening tool in dysphagia secondarily to artificial airway. 2- In our opinion if the EEBD is negative and there is high clinic sus- picion, FEES should be considered to confirm, or not, dysphagia.

Kalaiselvan - Sri Ramachandra University, Department of Critical Care Medicine, Chennai, India Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A657 Introduction: Endotracheal intubation(ETI)is a commonly performed procedure in the intensive care unit (ICU). Many life-threatening com- plications occur during endotracheal intubation and are associated with poor patient outcomes. Objectives: To analyze the indications, complications and outcomes of patients who underwent Endotracheal intubation in ICU. Methods: Prospective observational study, done in a university hos- pital ICU over a period of 6 months. Adult patients admitted to ICU requiring endotracheal intubation during ICU stay for more than24 hours were included. Data collection included demographic pro- file, vital parameters, APACHE II and SOFA scores, oxygenation and ventilation status and indications for endotracheal intubation. Out- come data was collected on complications of Endotracheal intub- ation, mortality, ICU LOS, hospital LOS and ventilator free days. Results: 171 patients fit into inclusion criteria. Mean age was 55.48(\u00b115.86) years, majority of patients were males(n = 112[65.4 %]). The mean APACHE II and SOFA scores were 19.82(\u00b14.547) and 5.64(\u00b12.619)respectively. Respiratory failure (51.46 %) was the most common reason for intubation followed by neurological deterioration (21.63 %). Majority of Endotracheal intubations were elective (81.28 %) and were performed by residents (43.85 %) with ICU experience of more than 3 years. 15.7 % of patients required muscle relaxant for facilita- tion of ETI. Most common complications were hypotension (39.18 %) and hypoxia (27.48 %) at the time of intubation. 5 (2.9 %) patients had cardiac arrest at the time of intubation, 18 (10.52 %) patients required vasopressor support post intubation. Mor- tality rate was 67.25 %(n = 115) with an ICU ALOS 8.27(\u00b16.32) days and hospital LOS 12.54(\u00b19.1) days. Average ventilator days were 7.27(\u00b15.06)days. 7 % of patients developed VAP and 17 % of patients required tracheostomy. Risk factors for mortality included higher age, high APACHE and SOFA scores, hypoxia and hypotension at the time of intubation, requirement of vasopressor support at the time of intubation. Conclusions: Endotracheal intubation was associated with high com- plications and poor outcomes. References 1. Simpson GD, Ross MJ, McKeown DW, Ray DC.

De Rosa - San Bortolo Hospital, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, San Bortolo Hospital, Vicenza, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A658 Introduction: Supraglottic airway devices are used with increasing frequency following routine anesthesia and for emergency airwaymanagement. Unfortunately, not all devices allow a possibility to per- form a secondary endotracheal intubation (ETI) through the device. A new promising device, the Spritztube (ST), has been developed com-bining the ability to perform both supraglottic ventilation and orotra-cheal fibreoptic intubation using the same device. Particularly, it is able to perform a supraglottic ventilation during positioning as tra- cheal cannula during fibroscopy.Objectives: To compare the ease, the time of insertion, and the suc- cess rates of use between the intubating laryngeal and the novel \u00ae). Methods: We evaluated the novel Spritztube and compared it to the Fastrach using a manikin-based study. Each partecipant received a ver-bal instruction and practical demonstration of technique of insertion for both devices on patient simulation manikins. Each participants used both devices in a randomised order. Time of placement (T1), time of in-flation (T2), the elapsed procedural time of insertion, ofexchange maneouver for intubation (T4), success rates and number of attempts were recorded for each supraglottic device. After a maximum of 3 attempts airway-management was defined as a failure.Results: A total of 47 participants were enrolled: 36 % without previous experience with Fibroscopy and 17 % without previous experiences with ETI. There was no difference in number of at- tempts for insertion between both devices(p = 0.68).Fastrach wasapplied 11 s faster than the Spritztube (median T3 Fas-trach:13 s.,Spritztube:24 s., p = 0.000). The exchange manoevrue for ETI was 11 s faster for Fastrach than the Spritztube (median T3 Fastrach:13 s.,Spritztube:24 0.000). Number attemptsfor to ETI were significantly more for Fastrach (p =0.000). Participants judged Spritztube as easier insertion than Fas- trach (p = 0.000). Spritztube had a significant higher success rate than Fastrach (p = 0.000). However the success rate did not de-pend on previous experience in ETI or in fibroscopy.Conclusions: The Spritztube performed similarly to the Fastrach in in- sertion and intubation times in a manikin setting.

Fernandez-Carmona - Hospital Virgen de las Nieves, Intensive Care, Granada, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A659 Introduction: Available data shows that dysphagia and swallowing disorder rate secondary to artificial airway and prolonged mechanical ventilation in critical tracheostomized patients is high (50-83 %),nevertheless it real incidence is not yet well established. Dysphagia isdirectly related to bronchial aspirations and respiratory infections. The rate of respiratory infections on tracheostomized patients is also very high (Some series next 100 %). The re-establishment of airwayusing speaking valves allow the rehabilitation and post-recovery ofthose disorders, as well as deglutition and phonatory system rehabilitation. The aim of EDISVAL Study is to determine the usefulness of speakingvalve in preventing respiratory nosocomial infections in critical tra-cheostomized patients diagnosed of dysphagia secondary to artificial airway, for what it was done a screening test of dysphagia to the crit- ical tracheostomized patients.Objectives: To describe the incidence of swallowing disorder in crit- ical patients who require tracheostomy secondary to artificial airway and prolonged mechanical ventilation. Methods: From September 2014 until December 2015, in all patients over 18 years, during mechanical ventilation weaning-decannulationphase, without neurological or surgical disease which could contrib- ute to the appearance of dysphagia, there was realized the Modified Evans Blue Dye Test (MBDT) as dysphagia screening test. This studywas carried out of simultaneous form in 7 intensive care units includ-ing first, second and third level centers. Results: Mean age average of the patients was 67,6 years, the ini- tial APACHE\u00b4S average was 23,6 points. Mean time of mechanicalventilation was 27,6 days. During the study period we studied 37patients by MEBDT, 34 patients were diagnosed of dysphagia, and included to the EDISVAL study; we did not carry out other specifics test of dysphagia to discriminate a possible MEBDT falsenegative.In the patients with negative MEBDT, not diagnosed of dysphagia, re- spiratory infections were not registered. In the patients diagnosed of dysfagia included at EDISVAL study, inspite of strict measures for it prevention, including absolute oral diet,15 respiratory infections were registered (40.54 %), 5 catalogued as tracheobronchitis and 10 as pneumonia. 3 of the patients who suf- fered respiratory serious infections died during hospital stay.Conclusions: The dysphagia secondary to artificial airway incidence in our series was 91,9 % according to the Modified Evans Blue Dye Test. Respiratory infections were a frequent complication in the pa- tients diagnosed of dysphagia, with a probable repercussion in themortality of the patients. References 1. Romero CM.

Fernandez-Carmona - Hospital Virgen de las Nieves, Intensive Care, Granada, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A660 Introduction: Available data shows that dysphagia rate, secondary to artificial airway and prolonged mechanical ventilation, in critical tra-cheostomized patients is high (50-83 %). Dysphagia is directly related to bronchial aspirations and respiratory infections. The rate of respira- tory infections on tracheostomized patients is also very high (Someseries next 100 %). The re-establishment of airway using speakingvalves allow the rehabilitation and post-recovery of those disorders, as well as deglutition and phonatory system rehabilitation. Objectives: Determine the usefulness of speaking valve in preventing respiratory nosocomial infections in critical tracheostomized patientsdiagnosed of dysphagia secondary to controlled clinical trial. From De- cember 2014 until February 2016, the use of speaking valve was ran-domized during mechanical ventilation weaning-decannulationphase in critical patients over 18 years, tracheostomized at ICU, diag- nosed of dysphagia secondary to artificial airway. Neurological pa- tients were excluded. In all cases it was contraindicated oral dietintake. This study was carried out of simultaneous form in 5 units ofintensive care including centers of the first, second and third level. Results: 32 patients were included, 72,7 % were men, mean age of 63,21 \u00b1 mean APACHE-II \u00b1 14,23 days. The most commonreason for ICU admission was respiratory 39.1 % of patients, followed by surgery and shock. After ramdomisation 19 patients were treated with speaking valve(SVgroup), and 13 by identical protocol without speaking valve(decannulation protocol, DPgroup). The incident of infections in the SVgroup was 26,3 % (5/19), 2 pneumonia and 3 cases of tracheo- bronquitis; and 61,5 % (8/13) in the DPgroup, 5 pneumon\u00eda and 3tracheobronquitis. Some cases of this group were more than one re-spiratory infection process. The mortality was 0 in the SVgroup and 3 in DPgroup. Both groups had a mean mechanical ventilation time and reasos ofICU admission similar, APACHE-II was higher in PDgroup points) and age (61.71 vs 66.71 years). SVgroup had a higher ICU stay than the DPgroup (51.00 vs 39.10 days) and greater hospital stay (69.44 vs 60.75 days). Patients who died were not those withhigher APACHEII or older in DPgroup.Conclusions: The incidence of infectious complications and mortality was lower in SVgroup. In the following months will continue this research in order to know if these differences are attributable toSV use A661 Endotracheal tube cuff pressures on admission to intensive care unit R.N. NikandishShiraz University Of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Islamic Republic of Iran Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A661 Introduction: tracheal mucosa and result in significant airway complications.We hypothesized that high cuff pressure on intensive care unit (ICU) admission is very common. So we designed this study as a quality measurement audit to gauge ETT cuff pressure on ICU arrival.Methods: In this prospective observational study we included all intubated who were admitted from different clinical area to ICU. We measured ETT cuff pressure on ICU admission using an aneroid cuffpressure gauge during a 6 month period.Results: We measured ETT cuff pressure in 159 patients on their ar- rival to ICU. The Mean cuff pressure on ICU admission was 63.94 (SD 31.52) cm H2O. There was no statistically significant difference in ETTcuff pressure between the patients admitted from different clinicalareas. Duration between tracheal intubation and patient handover to ICU was 9.5 (SD 8.0) hours. Conclusion High ETT cuff pressure is very common on ICU admission and this can set the stage for airway complications. Using cuff pres-sure gauge is a simple and effective way to measure and readjust ETT cuff pressure immediately after intubation. References 1. Andrews MJ, Pearson FG.

Li Bassi - Hospital Clinic, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Barcelona, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): aspiration (SSA) reduce ventilator-associated pneumonia (1). An innovative device has been recently developed to insert an aspir- ation catheter into the subglottic region, post intubation with stand- ard ETTs. Objectives: In animals on mechanical ventilation up to 76 hours, we evaluated safety and efficacy of the novel SSA strategy, in compari- son with standard ETTs comprising SSA. Methods: Thirteen pigs (31.7 \u00b1 2.6 Kg) on mechanical ventilation (MV) for 76 hours. Pigs were randomized to be intubated with a standard SSA ETT (Control). Upon aspiration, the patency of the suc- tion lumen was tested; then, secretions were aspirated and the vol- ume quantified. Whereas, in the treatment group, a novel delivery device was employed to advance a 12-Fr suction catheter into the subglottic space and perform SSA as reported above (Fig. 81). A: 1, Subglottic secretions aspiration catheter; 2, Delivery device to place the aspiration catheter into the subglottic region. B: 3, ETT. Upon insertion, the delivery device was placed along the concave surface of the endotracheal tube and advanced up to the larynx. 4, Then, the catheter was inserted into the internal channel of the delivery device and advanced up to the subglottic region. Upon autopsy, lesions of the 1) epiglottis, 2) corniculate cartilages, 3) true vocal cords, and 5) subglottic region were grossly scored: 0: erosion; 3: ex- posed cartilage. Results: Six animals (4 controls and 2 treatment) were kept in the lateral-Trendelenburg position and aspiration was performed every 4 hours. Whereas, 7 animals (2 controls and 5 treatments) were kept in semi-recumbent position and SSA was performed every 8 hours. Among animals in lateral-Trendelenburg position, SSA was performed 18.2 \u00b1 0.9 and 18.5 \u00b1 0.7 times in the control and treatment groups, respectively (p = 0.972). Overall, the mean volume of aspiration was 0.05 \u00b1 0.07 (range 0 -0.25 mL) and 0.03 \u00b1 0.07 mL (0 -0.25 mL) of se- cretions/hour in the control and treatment group, respectively (p = 1.000). The median [IR] level of injury was 1[0] and 1[0] in the control and treatment group, respectively (p = 0.258). Whereas, amonganimals in semi-recumbent position, SSA was performed 5.5 \u00b1 0.7 and 7.6 \u00b1 2.7 times in the control and treatment groups, respectively (p = 0.378). Overall, the median [IR] volume of aspiration was 0.14 \u00b1 0.12 (range 0 -0.41 mL) and 0.17 \u00b1 0.30 mL (0 -1.33 mL) of secretions/ hour in the control and treatment group, respectively (p = 0.324). The median [IR] level of injury was 1[0] and 1[0] in the control and treat- ment group, respectively (p = 0.734). Conclusions: In preliminary in-vivo evaluations, the novel SSA strat- egy is safe and not inferior to standard ETTs comprising SSA. References 1. Muscedere J et al.

A664 Comparison of the clinical performance of air-Q and i-gel during positive pressure ventilation A. Youn, J. Gyung Hwang Chungnam National University Hospital, Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Daejon, Republic of Korea Correspondence: J. Gyung Hwang - Chungnam National University Hospital, Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Daejon, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A664 Introduction: Successful airway management is crucial in emergency care especially when endotracheal intubation is difficult. The air-Q is a new supraglottic airway device used as a conduit for endotracheal intubation. This study compared the performance of air-Q with i-gel regarding airway seal pressures and ease of intubation for better function. Objectives: We hypothesized that the air-Q would have better airway sealing than the i-gel due to its larger cuff design and flexibility and compared it between patients undergoing positive pressure ventila- tion for general anesthesia. Methods: 50 patients classified as ASA 1 or 2 undergoing general anesthesia were randomly allocated into two groups, group A (Air-Q) or group I (i-gel). Anesthesia was induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and rocuronium 0.5/kg. We compared the ease of intubation, vital signs, airway sealing pressures, and adverse events upon and during inser- tion. Acceptable peak inspiratory pressures were limited to 40 cmH2O, in which cases exceeded, endotracheal intubation was performed. Results: Airway leak pressures were lower in group A than group I. Hemodynamic and respiratory conditions were statistically insignifi- cant between the two groups. Adverse events occurred in 1 patient from group A and 4 patients from group I in the post-anesthetic care unit. Conclusions: The Air-Q provides an adequate airway seal and can be efficiently used in patients undergoing positive pressure ventilation. References 1. Bamgbade OA, Macnab WR, Khalaf WM.

Mu\u00f1oz Garach - Complejo Hospitalario de Granada, ICU, Granada, Spain Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A665 Introduction: Endotracheal intubation is a common procedure in the treatment of respiratory failure in the Intesive Care Unit (ICU). Some- times generates local complications that might difficult or even make it imposible to remove the artificial airway (AA). If this complications are not detected before the AA removal, stridor, laryngeal dyspnea or spasms might apear requiring emergency reintubation/recannula- tion in rather difficult circumstances with severe increase in morbi- mortality. Therefore is essential to follow a clinical guideline in the removal of the AA once overcome weaning and espontaneous breathing test. Objetive: To describe the incidence of treatable causes for negative cuff-leak test in our critical care unit. Methods: We prospectively registered all patients admitted in our ICU (18 beds) who underwent artificial airway procedure (endo- tracheal tube or tracheotomy) during 24 months (from January 2014 to December 2015). In every patient who overcome the weaning guideline process (including spontaneous breathing test), we implemented also an aritificial airway removal guideline, con- taining the cuff-leak test, in Volume Controlled Ventilation (CMV) and with the cuff deflated. If leak rate was greater than 20 % of tidal volumen, \"positive test \", we could safely remove the artificial airway. If leak rate was less than 20 %, \"negative test \",a nu p p e r airway revision by direct laryngoscopy was performed to evaluate treatable causes. Results: We registered 407 patients in ICU with artificial airway pro- cedures (endotracheal tuve, tracheotomy) during the study period. Mean age was 62 years (48 -76 CI 95 %), 67,8 % were male and the mean APACHE was 23 (33 -13 CI 95 %). Before extubation/decanula- tion, cuff-leak test was performed. 374 (91.9 %) had \"positive test \" and 33 (8.1 %) \"negative test \". In these negative test a direct laryngoscopy was performed and the following treatable causes were found: 23 laryngeal edema, 2 dental bridge in tracheotomy, 1 with a bloodclot in the larynx and finally 1 with a tumor in vocal cordv (Fig. 82). Conclusions /C15The inclusion of an upper airway direct laryngoscopy exam after negative cuff-leak test, ensures specific diagnosis and manage of the treatable causes. /C15In all our patients, the artificial airway was safely removed after treating the cause, avoiding the increase of morbimortality due to reintubation/recanulation.A666 How do we deal with the airway: assessment in the emergency department (ED) and intensive care unit (ICU) C. Teixeira1,2, H. Figueira1, R. Oliveira1, A. Ci\u00eancias Biom\u00e9dicas Dr. Abel Salazar, Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A666 Introduction: Airway management is a commonly performed proced- ure in the ED and in the ICU. The management of the airway is cru- cial in that setting, being tracheal intubation (TI) the gold standard. Several studies identify higher rates of complications in these settings. Objectives: Assess the practice of airway approach in the ED and ICU in a university hospital, and identify risk factors for difficult intubation and its main complications. Methods: Prospective observational study. Data collection regarding the operator, the patient, the technique and the outcome were com- pleted at the time of intubation. Attempted laryngeal visualization to facilitate TI was used as the definition of an attempted intubation (ATI). Results: 182 records filled, 257 ATI during this period. The leading cause was acute respiratory failure (26 %). 122 patients were intu- bated at the first attempt and 60 needed 2 or more attempts (min1, max4). The success rate of TI at the first attempt was 67 %. Intub- ation success rate at first ATI was similar during day or night (p = 0.53). Regarding the operator: 18 % of the missed TI at first ATI were Fig. 82 (abstract A665).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 341 of 607performed by anesthetists, while that number rose to 75 % in non- anesthetists (p = 0.013). 88 % of missed TI at first ATI were performed by residents, while senior doctors just missed 12 % (p < 0.033). Con-sidering the operator reported own experience: 65 % with few airwayexperience didn\u00b4t intubate at first attempt, doctors with good and excellent airway expertise just missed first ATI in 20 % and 3 % of the times respectively (p < 0.001). Predictive signs of difficult airwaywere identified in 95 patients. Being obese and neck deformity themost reported ones (Respectively 25 % and 21 %). 70 % of patients who have not been intubated at the first ATI had predictive signs of difficult airway (p < 0.001). Complications were reported in 30 % ofthe ATI, namely: failed intubation 18 %, esophageal intubation 9 %,aspiration of gastric contents 2 %, and cardiac arrest 1 %. Main con- tributory factors reported for failure to IT at first ATI: operator's inex- perience 13 % and patient-related 11 % (both attained statisticalsignificance p < 0.001). Lack of equipment and lack of strategy delin-eation were only reported in 2 % each. No surgical or rescue airway supraglottic devices were required. Conclusions: Failed TI and its complication are largely due to the operator's inexperience. As our hospital is a teaching one, TI in ourED and ICU is performed mostly at first by trainee doctors. Patient- related factors also play a role. Risk factors assessment for difficult in- tubation should be a routine in ICU patients Training in recognitionand planning the approach of the difficult airway and expertise im-mediately available are crucial in the airway management in these settings.

Percutan-eous dilatational tracheostomy is a common procedure in Intensive Care Units. . Intubation and tracheostomy can be complicated by de- formities of the cervical spine and the temporomandibular joints andcervical spine. A combination of cervical kyphosis and osteoporosisalso leads to complexities in patient positioning. Objectives: These fact could suggest that patients suffering spondyl- itis ankylosans are not suitable for percutaneous dilatational trache-ostomy but no study or case report ever reported about feasibility ofthis procedure in Bechterew`s disease. Methods: Retrospective analysis at one Level 1 trauma center of pa- tient records from 2002 -2016, identifying all ankylosans (SA) and percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT).Results: 31 patients underwent PDT. All PDTs were performed using the Ciaglia single step dilation technique. No cardiopulmonary or surgical complication occurred during the procedure, especially noairway loss, no desaturation, no hemodynamic abnormalty or bleed-ing. One patient received airway switch from a small nasal tube to a laryngeal mask before starting the PDT procedure. Conclusions: A percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy in a patient with Bechterew' s disease is a safe procedure in an experiencedcentre.References Dean L.E., Jones G.T., MacDonald A.G., Downham Napolitano technique, and outcomes.

Experimental studies in acute lung injury A668 Heparin effect in alveolar macrophages in acute 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A668 Introduction: Acute Lung Injury (ALI) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) are characterized by a promptly release of proin- flammatory mediators that downregulate natural anticoagulantmechanisms, initiate the impair fibrinolysis andproduce the rupture of the endothelial and epithelial monolayer (1). Proinflammatory activated Alveolar Macrophages (AM) initiate and regulate ALI/ARDS inflammation and contribute to the propagationof the coagulant response. Currently there is no effective treatmentfor this disease. Previous studies have presented the beneficial effect of anticoagulants for their anticoagulation and anti-inflammatory ac- tion (2 -3). Objectives: Evaluate the effect of local heparin administration in AM in ALI model. Methods: Sprague -Dawley rats (~300 g) underwent intratracheal administration of Lipopolysaccharide (LPS 10 g/g body weight) or Saline (0.9 %) in control animals. Saline or heparin (1000 IU/kg body weight) was nebulized through Aeroneb system (PhilipsHealthcare) at constant oxygen flow (2 L/min) before and afterLPS administration. Animals were sacrificed 24 h after injury and AM from all groups were isolated with a bronchoalveolar lavage. The pro and anti-inflammatory pathways involved evaluated by qRT-PCR. Neutrophil and monocytic chemo-attractant activity of AM was evaluated by CXCL1 and CCL2, re- spectively. Data expressed as media \u00b1 SEM, relative to GAPDH and fold over saline group (n = 8 for all the study groups). Statistics:One-Way-ANOVA and Newman Keuls post-hoc test (Statistical sig-nificance: p 0.05). Results: In ALI model there was a significant increase in observed in iNOS, IL10, and Smad 2. Although no changes were detected on neutrophil chemoattractant activity of AM, monocytic chemotattrac- tant activity was diminished by heparin (Fig. 83). Conclusions: Altogether indicate that AM have a major role in the ALI development and resolution.

Tagliabue - University of Calgary, Critical Care Medicine, Calgary, Canada Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A669 Introduction: Classically, with increasing CO 2there is in- crease in minute ventilation and diaphragm electromyogram (EMG) (1). Several lines of evidence suggest that the Costal and Crural por- tions of the diaphragm are two distinct muscles (2,3). Although both muscles would be expected to increase in parallel with minute venti- lation during CO 2stimulation, there is no a priori reason that Costal and Crural would have identical neuro-mechanical recruitment. Objectives: To determine if the two portions of the diaphragm, Cos- tal (COS) and Crural CRU) diaphragm, are during CO2stimulated ventilation. Methods: Sonomicrometry transducers and EMG wire electrodes were implanted in the left COS and CRU of 21 mongrel dogs. After full recov- ery from diaphragm segmental shortening, the animals were studied awake, breathing through a mask. Airflow, EtCO 2, heart rate, muscle length and moving averaged EMG (mavgEMG) were recorded during room air and CO 2stimulated breathing (3). Output included breath-by- breath breathing pattern, muscle Shortening (% of change in Length from baseline), Peak EMG ( PeakEMG, % of baseline-to-peak difference in mavgEMG), EtCO heart rate. Results: For N = 21 (mean wgt 31.1 kg) studied after 16 days post- implantation (range 10 -23 days) of Sonomicrometry transducers and EMG electrodes, minute ventilation (Vi) and tidal volume increased sig- nificantly from room air with CO 2stimulated breathing [8.8 and 0.3,10.2 and 0.4, 14.6 and 0.6, and 18.2 and 0.7 and 22.9 and 0.8 at room air, low (47), medium-low(53), medium-high (58) and high (63 Torr) CO2, respectively]. Respiratory rate did not significantly change (range 25-29). As CO 2increased, PeakEMG of COS and CRU increased con- jointly in a linear fashion tracking changes in Vi,. however, there was a significantly (p < 0.05) greater increasing in ShortCOS compared to ShortCRU at medium-low, medium-high and high levels of CO 2. Conclusions: With CO 2stimulation, neural drive of COS and CRU increased together in lock-step with ventilation. However, there was distinctive differential ac tion of the diaphragm segments. Relative mechanical action of CO S was significantly higher than CRU at equivalent increasing of CO 2. This results suggest a predominant contribution of the Costal portion of the diaphragm in order to generate the tidal volume during hypercapnic stimulation. References (1)Lopata M.

The disabling fatigue and the higher susceptibility to developing a viral respiratory infection that many survivors experience in post-sepsis syndrome cannot yet be explained. Herein, we sought to evaluate the impact of sepsis on lung structures of the post-sepsis survivors.

After 30 days was observed a reduction of the alveolar wall thickening, complete reduction of alveoli vascular congestion in the entire lung, however, there was a persistence of the hyperplasia of BALT. In animals submitted to more severe sepsis (S9-30d), the alveolar wall thickening remained more intense, there was decreased of inflammatory cells infiltrates, but persisted the al- veoli wall congestion and BALT hyperplasia and hypertrophy (Fig. 2). These findings showed that depending on the severity of sepsis, the parenchyma and pulmonary microcirculation injuries may have sig- nificant recovery (S8) or minimal (S9), even 30 days after the clinical recovery from sepsis. In addition, presence of histological signs sug- gestive of persistence of a state of the activated BALT, even in less aggressive sepsis (S8-30d), shows that still exist a continuous stimu- lating inflammatory factor even in the absence of clinical signs of in- fection. Thus, the overall data demonstrate that clinical recovery is not synonymous of a normal physiological state, on the contrary, hist- ology showed an ongoing severe lung disease process at post-sepsis period. How long last these eventsis unknown, but the data suggest that post-sepsis physiological state is far from the standard health.

The de- tailed mechanisms of EphA2 signaling in lung injury are unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the role of EphA2 signaling, as well as related sig- naling pathways, in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury model. Methods: Three experimental mouse groups were formed: PBS + IgG (IgG instillation after PBS exposure), LPS antibody instillation posttreatment after LPS Cell numbers and protein concentration in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), changes in histopathology and the expression of several signaling pathway proteins \u2014including PI3K-Akt-NF-kB, Src, Erk, E-cadherin and mTOR \u2014were compared among three groups. Results: Acute LPS exposure significantly upregulated EphA2 and EphrinA1 EphA2 mAb administration attenuated lung injury and reduced BALF cell counts and protein concentration (all, P < 0.05). EphA2 mAb post- treatment and phospho-S6K. In addition, inhibiting the EphA2 receptor augmented the expression of E- cadherin, which is involved in cell-cell adhesion. Conclusions: The present data suggest that the EphA2 receptor may be an unrecognized modulator of \u2014in LPS-induced lung injury. Further studies are needed to verify the potential of EphA2 recep- tor inhibitors as novel therapeutic ag ents for LPS-induced lung injury. References 1.

Aachen University, Aachen, of Anesthesiology and Campus Charit\u00e9 Gackenbach, Germany Pomprapa Medical Information Technology, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A672 Fig. 86 (abstract A670).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 344 of 607Introduction: One of the therapeutic ventilation goals of the ARDS Net- work protocol is to control blood pH in a certain range (7.30-7.45) [1]. Only a strict and frequent schedule of arterial blood gas analysis can result in a good performance for such control, which mainly relies on personal efforts. Objective: This preliminary work was to analyze the possibility to control blood pH via the average carbon dioxide elimination ( VCO 2) that can be noninvasively measured from the exhaled air during the closed-loop ventilation therapy [2]. METHOD. Approved by the local animal ethical committee, a male pig (45.4 kg) was anesthetized, intubated and ventilated in supine position for 1 h. After induction of ARDS by repetitive lung lavages, automatic ventilation therapy was continued for 3 h. All vital parame- ters including the CO 2data from a capnography (CO 2SMO+) were continuously recorded by a medical panel PC. Based on the ARDSNet protocol, higher PEEP/lower FiO 2settings [1] were automatically ap- plied to the pig. After the onset of the automatic ventilation, the average VCO 2was computed for every 30 min. Results: All goals of the ARDSNet protocol were satisfied in terms of oxygenation, pH value and plateau pressure. The figure shows the experimental results of the pH value compared to the computed average V CO2during the ventilation therapy. It should also be noted that a new setting of PEEP value influences the dynamics of VCO 2. Conclusions: The carbon dioxide elimination is a possible intermedi- ate parameter for the use of noninvasive indirect control of blood pH that could fulfil a fully closed-loop ventilation therapy based on the ARDSNet protocol.

The aggressive fluid therapy is a contro- versial procedure by the possibility of increment the lung edema. Besides, due to the difficulties to study the lung, the consequences in the tissue injuries in sepsis patients in the post-sepsis phases are little known. The present study investi- gated the effects of aggressive-fluid therapy in lung tissues of the sepsis survivors. Methods: Adult Wistar rats (200 g) were submitted to sepsis (S8) (iv. 2 mL E. coli 108CFU/mL 1,D L 6 0i n2 6h o u r s ) ,o rs e p s i sa n d Ringer Lactate (S8HH) (iv. 30 mL/kg/20 min), 30 minutes after sepsis challenge. The tissue samples were evaluated by histology (T6h,T30d), using HE dyes.The S8-6 h group showed a vascular congestion on the alveoli walls, withintense thickening and infil- hyperplasia.

The aggressive fluid therapy in S8HH-6 h group resulted in lesser vascular congestion in the peripheral al- veolar walls. More pronounced l esions were seenin the central part of the organ (hilo); with venous congestion and thickening of the alveoli-wall, infiltration of mononuclearcells and neutrophils in intra epithelia's spaces of the bronchi; BALT hyperplasia was highly evident. The aggressive flu id didnot recovered the injuries of the S8HH-30d group. the vascular congestion and thickened parenchyma were observed in whole lung, although without in- flammatory infiltrate. BALT showed less hypertrophy and hyper- p l a s i a .I ns u m m a r y ,a l t h o u g ht h e r ew a saw o r s e n i n go ft h e alveoli injuries, the signs of non-activated BALT suggested low immune activation under aggressive-fluid therapy but with high pulmonary edema due to their high permeability characteristics. The overall data suggested that lung not have adequate physi- ology and anatomy to support a fluid aggressive therapy de- manding a more careful maneuver in terms of volume and perfusion velocity. These results reinforce the doubts that inad- equate management of sepsis may cause consequences in the future. References 1. Koh Ivan HJ, et al.: Shock 2010, 34 (7 Suppl 1):27 -33. 2.

Cardiogenic pulmonary oedema produces hemoconcentration and haematocrit (Ht) is a good marker of hemoconcentration. It is not determined if the increase of Ht during weaning protocol may predict failure in weaning from IMV. Objective: To determine if the increase of Ht during spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is a predictor of failure in weaning from IMV. Methods: We prospectively included patients with IMV >72 hours. A SBT was performed with a T-piece for two hours. Ht value at the start and at the end (or failure) of the SBT was measured and the delta was calculated. Logistic regression analysis was performed to deter- mine the association between the increase of Ht and failure in wean- ing from IMV. Its performance as a predictor of failure was assessed by its discriminative capacity and calibration. A p value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Fifty-five patients were analysed, 58.2 % female, mean age 49.9 years. Thirty-two (58.2 %) patients had elevation of the Ht at the end of the SBT and 41.8 % failed in weaning from IMV. The increase of Ht had OR of 1.22 (95%CI 1.05-1.42, p = 0.011) and behaved as a good predictor of failure in weaning from IMV, with area under the receiver operative characteristics (ROC) curve of 0.719 (p = 0.006) and Hosmer-Lemeshow Chi2of 41 (p = 0.142). Conclusions: failed in weaning from IMV has signifi- cantly increased the value of Ht at the end of the SBT. The increaseof Ht is a risk factor and has adequate discriminative capacity and calibration to predict failure in weaning from IMV.

Cardoso - University of Algarve, Department of Biomedical Sciences and Medicine, Faro, Portugal Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A675 Introduction: With a high prevalence in Intensive Care Units (ICU), the Ventilator-Associated pneumonia (VAP) has been responsible for increased mortality and morbidity rates, hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), costs and a set of other complications. Usually, VAP develops 48 h after the beginning of mechanical venti- lation (MV) and can be classified as of early- or late-onset. Objectives: This study aims to evaluate the incidence, length of hos- pital stay, number of days of MV, and treatment and prevention methods (bundles) of VAP during the year of 2015, in the ICU of CHA-Faro, as well as to compare these results with those from 2014. Methods: Patients were evaluated according to their age, sex, type of VAP (early-/late-onset), identified microorganism, antibiotic treat- ment, admission type and severity scores (APACHE II and SAPS II), as well as the assessment of the likelihood of lung infection (CPIS). Results: Of the 473 patients admitted to the ICU, 24 developed VAP. The incidence rate was 5.07 %, and the incidence density rate was 9.74 per 1000 ventilation days. The mean value of CPIS was 1.35 \u00b1 7.5. Five cases were classified as early-onset (20.83 %) and 19 as late- onset (79.17 %). The mean values of both, hospital stay (7.12 \u00b1 9.97 and sig- nificantly (p < 0.01) between patients without and with VAP, respectively. The most common isolated microorganism was P. aeru- ginosa (57.9 %) in late-onset VAP, with no microorganisms isolated (60 %) in the early-onset VAP. The adherence to VAP prevention bun- dles from January to October 2015 was 14,91 %. Conclusions: Our data indicate that the incidence of VAP was re- duced from 2014 to 2015. The increase on adherence to VAP bundles might explain this signigficant reduction. Decrease on VAP incidence was significantly asociated with reduction on days of mechanical ventilation and length of hospital stay.

Almaziad - University of Toledo Medical Center, Toledo, United States Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A676 Introduction: Patients who are on mechanical ventilation have an in- creased risk of developing Ventilator associated event (VAE) which is tiered into three definitions; is a rare yet serious compli- cation that carries a high risk of morbidity and mortality. Current guidelines, published in 2005 by the American Thoracic Society in as- sociation with the Infectious Diseases Society of America, recom- mend the use of empiric antibiotics therapy. Objective: This is an ongoing research with the aim of examining the trends in the management of VAC and minimizing the use of vanco- mycin in patients on mechanical ventilation due to the higher risk of developing multi-drug resistant organisms and as a consequence, de- teriorating to IVAC and VAP as compared to other antibiotics. Methods: A retrospective analysis of data collected from 858 patients admitted to the intensive care unit at the University of Toledo Med- ical Center and received empiric antibiotic therapy. Among the sam- ple of patients, 152 met CDC-defined criteria for a ventilator- associated event. Additionally, those that met VAE criteria were strati- fied by VAE type, which yielded 82 VACs, 38 IVACs, and 32 PVAPS. Results: Vancomycin was used frequently in patients on mechanical ventilation. Among 706 patients who did not develop VAE, it was used in 62.5 %. Furthermore, it was used in 80.5 %, 94.7 % and 81.3 % in pa- respectively and 84.2 % col- lectively. Overall, the primary use of three antibiotic groups (Penicillin, cephalosporin and vancomycin) is consistent through each stage of VAE and likewise in the non-VAE group; cephalosporin was used in 63.2 % in the VAE group and 51.6 % in non-VAE while penicillin was used in 59.2 % in the VAE group and 43.3 % in the non-VAE group. In addition, the use of Vancomycin either alone or in combination with other antibiotics is associated with VAEs (OR = 3.2). Conclusion By CDC definition, those that have met IVAC or PVAP criteria would have been on a minimum of 4 days of antimicro- bial therapy. The extensive use of Vancomycin in critically-ill pa- tients compared to other antibiotics can be a contributing factor in the development of resistant organisms leading to subsequent complications.

Santini1, M. Milesi2, Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A677 Introduction: Driving airway pressure, the difference between plateau (end of an inspiratory pause) and end-expiratory airway pressure, can be an independent predictor of ventilator- induced lung injury (VILI) [1]. How- ever, during ongoing mechanical vent ilation, (dynamic) end-inspiratory airway pressure exceeds (static) plateau airway pressure, especially when inspiratory flows are very high [2]. Thus, for the same static driving airway pressure, different dynamic driving airway pressures can be reached. Objectives: To compare the role of static and dynamic driving airway pressures in the development of VILI. Methods: Sixteen healthy piglets were anesthetized, paralyzed and mechanically ventilated for 54 hours with no positive end-expiratorypressure. Animals were divided into two groups that were matched forstatic driving airway pressure ( P AW,stat), defined as above, but not for dynamic driving airway pressure ( PAW,dyn), defined as the difference between airway pressure recorded when flow zeroed immediately afteran end-inspiratory occlusion (P1) and end-expiratory airway pressure.Lower and higher dynamic driving airway pressures were obtained by using lower or higher inspiratory flows. Respiratory rate was always 15 breath-per-minute. VILI was diagnosed if final lung weight (measuredwith a balance) exceeded initial lung weight (measured with computedtomography), as for edema. Data were compared between the two groups with Student's tand Fisher's Exact tests. Results: The two groups of animals were ventilated with similar static but different dynamic driving airway pressures (Table 66). Incidence of VILI was 25 % among animals ventilated with lower and 75 % among those ventilated with higher dynamic driving airway pressure (p = 0.13). On average, lung weight decreased over time ( 56 \u00b1 60 g) in the former group whereas it increased (98 \u00b1 166 g) in the lattergroup (p = 0.04). Mortality at 54 hours was 13 % among animals ven- tilated with lower and 63 % among those ventilated with higher dy- namic driving airway pressure (p = 0.12).Conclusions: For the same static driving airway pressure, higher dy- namic driving airway pressures may increase the incidence of (fatal) ventilator-induced lung injury.

Methods that can provide simultaneously high-resolution, in-vivo conditions and in-formation about the core region of the lungs are lacking. Ventila-tory strategies to support lung function rely upon the idea that lung alveoli are isotropic balloons that accommodate gas pro- gressively and that pressure/volume curves derive by the inter-play of opening pressures and position of alveoli inside the lung.This simplistic idea has been challenged by subpleural micros- copy 1, magnetic resonance imaging2and computed tomography (CT) of kinetics of airspaces in healthy (HC) and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) conditions.Methods: The study was conducted in seven anesthetized New Zealand rabbits. They underwe nt SRCT scans (resolution of 47.6 m)of the lung at decreasing PEEP levels of 12, 9, 6, 3 and 0c m H 2O during end-expiratory holds. Pulmonary imaging was executed during HC and after induction of ARDS by repeatedlung lavages and injurious ventilation (inspiratory pressure of 35 and PEEP = 0 cmH 2O). Three concentric regions-of-interest (ROI) were studied: subpleural (SP), p eripheral (PE) and core (CO). Im- ages were enhanced by phase contrast algorithms. AirspacesNumber (AN), covered area (AA) and dimensions (AD) were computed by using the Image Processing Toolbox for MatLab (Mathworks, Natick, USA). Student's T-test was used to assessany statistically significant difference produced by PEEP or ROIposition. Results: AN and AA decreased with decreasing PEEP, however in ARDS at PEEP lower than 6 cmH 2O they remained stable. The three ROIs had similar courses but with different magnitudes. ADduring HC showed a tendency to reduce progressively after 9 cmH 2O; during ARDS this tendency was observed sharply after 6 cmH 2O. Conclusions: Alveolar kinetics is different In HC and ARDS de-recruitment and isotropic deflation are both present, however their entity and proportion depend on the applied pressure. In HC, alveolar dimensions in the studied rangesupport the idea of a continuous derecruitment simultaneous withisotropic deflation. In ARDS, passage from PEEP 12 to 6 cmH 2Oi s characterized by a sharp derecruitment (alveoli do not change appre- ciably dimensions but can be either open or closed). In ARDS lungsthis may be consequence of their high critical closing pressures andelastance. References 1.

Pellegrini - Bari University, Department of Emergency and Organ Transplant, Bari, Italy Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A679 Introduction: We have previously found that during spontaneous breathing (SB) the diaphragm exerts an expiratory breaking effect, maintaining lung volume. In this experimental study in a porcinemild acute respiratory distress (ARDS) model we compared the effecton lung aeration between full mechanical ventilation (MV) and SB and our hypothesis was that SB, due to the breaking activity by the diaphragm, would improve intraparenchymal distribution of gas dur-ing expiration and reduce atelectasis formation.Methods: A mild acute respiratory distress syndrome was induced in five anesthetized, tracheostomized pigs by repeated lung lavages, targeting a PaO 2/FiO 2of 250 mmHg. After stabilization, the animals were allowed to breathe spontaneously and underwent a decremen-tal continuous positive end-expiratory pressure (CPAP/PEEP) trial at 15, 12, 9, 6, 3 and 0 cmH 2O. Then the same sequence was repeated during MV after muscle relaxation. Para-diaphragmatic expiratory dy-namic CT-scans were collected four (L1) and one cranial tothe diaphragm. The amount of gas (Vgas, [mL]) for each CT-image at half and end expiration was calculated in all the compartments from +100 to 1000 Hounsfield Units (HU). The amount of atelectasis (be- tween 100 and +100 HU) for each selected CT-image was also mea- sured. Paired samples Student t-test was applied to assess any statistically significant difference between study conditions. Results: At CPAP/PEEP levels equal or lower than 6 cmH 2O, Vgas was higher during SB than during MV at all distances from the diaphrag-matic dome and, in addition, at both half and end-expiration. The in- crease in atelectasis with decreasing CPAP/PEEP was in all animals larger during MV than SB. Only during SB, and not during MV condi-tions, the lung near the diaphragmatic dome (L2) was less atelectaticthan the lung further away from it (L1). More atelectasis during MV than SB was observed already at half-expiration. Conclusions: SB maintains the amount of lung aeration significantly better than MV in a collapse-prone mild ARDS model. Furthermore,SB protected against atelectasis formation: this effect was visible already at half expiration. Therefore we deduce that the improved redistribution of gas and thedecreased atelectasis formation depend on the preserved diaphrag-matic contraction. These findings have potential implications for the design of new ventilatory strategies. Grant acknowledgementThe Swedish Heart Lung Fund; The School of Anesthesia of BariUniversity.

Gremo - M\u00e4larsjukhuset, Clinic for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Eskilstuna, Sweden Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A680Introduction: Sepsis is a common cause for admission to the ICU and more than a quarter who suffer from septic shock dies (1). Severe sepsis and septic shock leads to failure of one or more organs. The brain canget affected by septic induced organ failure, a condition known assepsis-associated encephalopathy (SAE). Protective ventilation (PV), with tidal volumes (TV) of 6 ml/kg, have showed a decrease in mortality in patients with sepsis and acute respiratory distresssyndrome, in comparison to routine ventilation (RV), TV of 10 ml/kg, and isthe recommended approach for intensivists worldwide (2). However, it's not yet shown whether PV can affect hemodynamic adverse effects and impaired usage of oxygen in the brain of a septic patient.Objectives: The purpose of this study is to examine brain oxygen- ation and hemodynamic changes in a sepsis porcine model and to investigate whether PV may affect cerebral usage and availability of oxygen, in comparison to RV.Methods: Data was collected in an ongoing project concerning neu- roinflammation in septic pigs, at the Hedenstierna Laboratory in Upp- sala, Sweden. Fourteen healthy pigs were randomized to two groups and anaesthe-tized. The groups were given an infusion of lipopolysaccharide to inducea septic like condition and was ventilated with RV (n = 6) respectively PV (n = 8). The animals received vascular catheters in order to draw arterial and venous blood gases before and after the blood has passed throughthe brain (sagittal sinus), and to m onitor hemodynamic changes. A flow meter was applied to the left internal carotid artery. Hemodynamic data and blood samples were collected every hour for 6 hours. Results: No difference in mean arterial pressure or arterial oxygen content was seen between the two groups. Protective ventilation en-hanced oxygen delivery index to the brain (44.5 \u00b1 14.1 to 30,3 \u00b1 5.9 mlO2/min/m2, p = 0.018). Increased blood flow to the brain due to reduced brain vascular resistance was seen in the PV-group in 0.018). Conclusions: Protective ventilation induces hemodynamic changes in cerebral blood vessels in the septic pig which reduces brain vascular re-sistance. These changes leads to improved oxygen delivery to thebrain. Further studies will take place in order to clarify the cause behind these changes, with an emphasis on the role of inflammatory bio- markers and neuronal nitric oxide synthase. References 1.

Conventional tidal volume (V T) preferentially to ventral aerated areas. Attempts to 'recruit' atelectasis with positive pressure often overinflate aerated regions. This occurs due to a large vertical gradient of pleural pressure (P pl) in ARDS. Prone positioning is the only effective means to lessen this P plgradient. Objectives: To test 2 hypotheses - That Continuous Negative Abdom- inal Pressure (CNAP), by selectively recruiting basal atelectasis, would: (1) improve lung function in a stable lung injury model; (2) attenuate ventilator-induced lung injury in a model of progressive lung injury. Methods: An established model of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) was used (anesthetized pig) and all animals were monitored using esophageal manometry (P es, pleural pressure), Electrical Imped- ance Tomography (EIT, regional ventilation) and pulmonary artery catheter. 2 series of experiments were performed. Series 1 - Stable Lung Injury . 7 pigs were subject to maximal lung re- cruitment using PEEP (20 cmH 2O) followed with progressive derecruit- ment by lowering PEEP in serial increments of 2 cmH 2O; full physiologic assessment was performed at each decrement of PEEP. This series of assessments was performed twice in each animal: once with CNAP ( 5c m H 2O) and once with no CNAP (the order was randomized). Series 2 - Progressive Lung Injury . Animals were randomized to 'CNAP' or 'no CNAP' (5 per group) and both groups were exposed to standardized injurious ventilation: V T20 mL/kg, low PEEP, pressure (P L,3 cmH 2O) for 4 h. Results: Series 1 - Stable Lung Injury .CNAP considerably reduced the vertical gradient of P pl(measured by direct instrumentation): at PEEP = 4: 11.3 \u00b1 3.5 vs. 6.6 \u00b1 2.5 cmH 2O, PEEP vs. PEEP + CNAP (P < 0.01). Application of CNAP consistently resulted in better oxygenation, re- spiratory system compliance, and more homogeneous ventilation at descending PEEP values from 12 to 4 cmH 2O. At PEEP = 4, the P/F ra- tio (mmHg) was 67 \u00b1 5 (no CNAP) vs. 263 \u00b1 36 (with CNAP, P < 0.01). At most levels of PEEP, oxygenation with added CNAP was greater despite a lower global P L(Fig. 92). . Dynamic CT demonstrated that addition of CNAP ( 5 cmH2O) to a PEEP level of 10 cmH2O yielded the same amount of aeration as a PEEP of 18 cmH2O. Series 2 - Progressive Lung Injury . Ventilation with no CNAP resulted in progressive lung injury; use of CNAP reduced the progression of lung injury resulting in greater oxygenation, respiratory system com- pliance, and homogeneity of ventilation (Figs. 93and 94) Conclusion CNAP selectively recruited basal atelectasis and ho- mogenized ventilation by increasing regional P Lin dependent lung. CNAP is not only 'equal but opposite' to positive pressure; instead, at comparable P Lit improves lung function and lessens lung injury.

Patients of treatmentgroup (n = 16) and controls (n = 9) were comparable regardingbaseline serum creatinine (3.6 \u00b1 1.5 vs. 54 \u00b1 vs. 2.5 \u00b1 0.4 ng/ dL), indocyanine green plasma disappearance rate (4.4 1.2 The primary endpoint was met in 0/9 (0 %) of the controls and 6/15 (40 %; p = 0.028) of the treatment group. Several other endpoints gave hints for abetter outcome in the treatment group compared to controls,although statistical s ignificance was failed : Complete response within 14d without RRT (9/16 (56 % vs. 2/9 (22 %); = changes in l ;n . s . ) ,r e q u i r e m e n to fR R T( 6 / 1 5( 4 0% )v s .5 / 9( 5 6% ) ;n.s.)and days without RRT albumin and crystalloids improves short termoutcome of patients with HRS. Due to the limited statisticalpower of this mono-centric study larger multi-centric trials also including targets for vasopressor therapy are required to con- firm these data. A683 Can we predict early liver failure with indocyanine green liverclearance? V. Baladr\u00f3n Anestesiologia y Reanimacion, Ciudad Real, Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A683 Introduction: A non-invasive liver function monitoring system, the LIMON\u00ae, has been developed to measure indocyanine green (ICG)elimination by pulse spectrophotometry. The aim is to assess the re-lationship between pre and post-operative ICG plasma disappearance rate (ICG PDR %/min) values and the onset of post-hepatectomy liver dysfunction. Postoperative liver failure after hepatectomy has beenidentified by the association of prothrombin time < serum bilirubin >50 umol/L (the \"50-50 \"criteria). Methods: patients scheduled for major liver resec- tions. Nine had chronic liver disease. Prothrombin time and serumbilirubin was determined on day 3 and day 5 in critical care unit after hepatectomy. IGC PDR was measured preoperatively and 24 hours postoperative.Results: We submit the values obtained for the variables of the ICG PDR pre and postoperative to an analysis of ROC curves, we found a very good predictive capacity for postoperative PDR showing an area under the curve of 0.96 but not well for preoperative PDR AUC = 0,667for determined early diagnosis of postoperative liver failure. Bilirrubinand prothrombin time show an area under the curve of 0,922 and 1. Significant correlation was found between ICG PDRpost measure- ment taken on postoperative day 1 and bilirubin level on day 5 (p <0,001) and prothrombin time on day 5 (p,001).The most sensible and specific value calculated for PDR post was 7.8. Discussion: LiMON ICG PDR measured by pulse spectrophotometry is a non-invasive and reliable liver function test for patients undergoingliver resection that aids in the prediction and early detection of post-operative liver failure.

Early identifi-cation of patients at risk for PLF could improve prognosis. Objectives: To determine the time course of lactate, lactate clearance and the relationship of lactate with other markers of liver functionand mortality.Methods: All consecutive patients (2008 -2014) who were postopera- tively admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after liver resection were included. Patients were classified as \"minor \"or\"major \"liver re- section based on a functional liver remnant (FLR) of 70 % and < 70 % respectively. Lactate clearance (%) was defined as: (lactate at ICU admission - lactate at 6 h) / lactate at ICU admission *100. The 50-50 criteria, a validated predictor of liver failure and death after liver resection, was defined as PT >21'' and serum bilirubin >50Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl Page 351 of 607umol/L on postoperative day 3 [1]. Numbers are expressed as median (interquartile range). Results: A total of 382 patients admitted to the ICU after liver resec- tions were included (80 % major resection). The main indication wascolorectal liver metastasis (63 %). At ICU admission lactate was 2.4 (1.7-3.4) mmol/L. Maximum lactate level was 2.7 (2 -4) mmol/L and occurred at 1.2 (0.3-7.9) hours after ICU admission. There was a sig-nificant difference between the lactate clearance at 6 h between theminor and major resections (25 % versus 14 %, P = 0.005). Highest PT was observed 30 hours after ICU admission. Only 3 patients met the \"50-50 criteria \"at day 3 and mortality at 30-days was 3.1 %. After multivariate analysis, lactate at ICU admission and perioperativeblood loss, but not FLR, lactate clearance at 6 h or the \"50-50 cri- teria \", were independent predictors of 30-day mortality. Conclusions: Lactate levels at ICU admission, but not lactate clear- ance during the first 6 hours, is a strong independent predictor for30-day mortality. In addition, lactate at ICU admission is of more prognostic value than the often used \"50-50 criteria \"(day 3) and also available much earlier.

Roedl - Medical University Center Hamburg- Eppendorf, Department for Intensive Care Medicine, Hamburg, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A685 Introduction: Sudden cardiac arrest (CA) is one of the leading causes of death in adults in many parts of the world. Every year estimated350.000 to 700.000 people in Europe are suffering CA and receivecardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Hypoxic hepatitis (HH) can be found in up to 10 % of critically ill patients. To date, data on inci- dence and outcome of HH after out-of-hospital CA and CPR is scarce.Objectives: Aim of the study was to determine incidence and out- come of HH in patients after out-of-hospital CA. Methods: Assessment of incidence of HH in a cohort of 798 consecu- tive patients with out-of-hospital CA and successful CPR that weretreated at the Medical University Vienna, 168 (21 %) patients with HHcould be identified. Patient characteristics, admission diagnosis, se- verity of disease, course of the disease and 28d mortality were assessed.Results: Overall, 168 patients representing 21 % of the total cohort (128 male, age 56 (47 -66) years) developed HH after CA with suc- cessful CPR were assessed. CA was witnessed in 136 (81 %) cases. Ini- tial rhythm was shockable (VT/VF) in 90 (54 %), non-shockable (PEA/Asystole) in 75 (44 %) and unknown in 3 (2 %) patients. Time toROSC was 27 (13,25 - 46,50) minutes. Cardiac events leading to CA were observed in 108 (64 %) of patients. SOFA-Score on admission was 11 (9 -12), SAPS II was 80 (75 -86).149 (89 %) patients needed mechanical ventilation on admission and 123 (73 %) needed vaso-pressor support. Mild therapeutic hypothermia was applied in 125 (74 %) patients. 28d-survival was 45 % in patients with HH and 60 % in the total cohort (p < 0,05). 107 (64 %) patients with HH were deador had bad neurological outcome (CPC III/IV) after 28d.Conclusions: New onset of HH is a frequent finding in patients fol- lowing successful CPR out-of-hospital and is associated Effect of acetaminophen on hepatocellular procalcitonin biosynthesis in and Intensive Care Medicine, Kiel, Germany;2UKSH, Campus Kiel, Institute for Clinical Chemistry, Kiel, Kott - UKSH, Campus Kiel, Department of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, Kiel, Germany Intensive Care 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A686 Introduction: Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in many countries. Following cell necrosis, the release of intracellular damage-associated molecular patterns, likehigh-mobility group-box protein-1 or DNA fragments, induces a ster-ile inflammation mediated through interleukin- (IL) 1, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF- ), amongst others 1. Procalcitonin (PCT) that is frequently used to monitor the course of systemic infections and in-flammation is also up-regulated through these pro-inflammatory me-diators 2. Therefore, PCT could be a potential biomarker to monitor the course of APAP overdose patients. Objectives: This pilot study sought to assess whether APAP administra- tion induced PCT synthesis in an in vitro model of human hepatomacells (HepaRG\u00a9) and to explore possible dose-dependent relationships. Methods: Human hepatoma cells (HepaRG\u00a9, Biopredic International, Rennes, France) were cultured according to the instructions of the manu-facturer. Cells were exposed to increasing concentrations of APAP (20 g/ ml; 200 g/ml, 500 g/ml). 24 hr 24/20, 24/500) and after 48 hr (48/20, 48/ 200, 48/500). To assess if HepaRG cells are capable of producing PCT,lipopolysaccharide stimulated cells were used as positive controls (24/LPSand 48/LPS). PCT was measured using the BRAHMS PCT LIA-Test aminotransferase (ALT) were measured as markers of hepatocellularinjury. All analyses were carried out in duplicate. Results: At both time points, no increase in PCT ng/ml, P compared to control (0.082 ng/ml). LDH concentra-tions (with control as 100 %) were 24/20: 106 %, 24/200: 98 %, 24/ 500: 51 %, and 48/20: 98 %, 48/200: 98 %, 48/500: 51 %. GLDH was 24/20: 98 %, 24/200: 119 %, 24/500: 143 %, and 48/20: 98 %, 48/200:98 %, 48/500: 51 %. AST was 24/20: 100 %, 24/200: 152 %, 24/500:193 %, and 48/20: 104 %, 48/200: 144 %, 48/500: 185 %. ALT was 24/ 20: 95 %, 24/200: 111 %, 24/500: 157 %, and 48/20: 90 %, 48/200: 131 %, 48/500: 95 %. LPS administration did not result in a statisti-cally significant increase either in PCT or the assessed liver markerswhen compared to control. Conclusions: APAP and LPS administration did not result in a signifi- cant increase in PCT in this in vitro model of APAP toxicity. APAPconcentrations might have been too low to induce enough cell ne-crosis and consecutive inflammation, although our experiments were based on APAP concentrations that are clinically relevant and found in APAP overdose patients.

The mortality of patients in ICU: alive (71.7 %), dead (28.3 %); at30 days: alive (56.6 %), dead (43.4 %).Applying a Chi square test the score \"LiFe\" is significant in order to assess the mortality of patients both in ICU and at 30 days (p < 0.002 and p < 0.003 respectively).The Pearson correlation coefficient between the different scoresand is: APACHE MELD 0.74. Conclusions: The score \"LiFe\" is a quick and useful tool in our envir- onment for assessing the prognosis of patients with liver disease ad-mitted to ICU. The score \"LiFe\" is correlated with MELD values. References 1. Edmark C, et al. LiFe: a liver injury score to predict outcome in critically ill patients.

Up to 10 % of critically ill patients suffer from HH during their stayat the ICU. Literature of HH after cardiac arrest is scarce and only avail-able in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (CA). To date no study evaluated the incidence and outcome of HH in patients after in-hospital CA. Objectives: Aim of the study was to determine incidence and out- come of HH in patients after in-hospital CA.Methods: Assessment of incidence of HH in a cohort of 270 consecu- tive patients with in-hospital CA and successful CPR that were treated at the Medical University Vienna. Patient characteristics, ad-mission diagnosis, severity of disease, course of the disease and 28dmortality were assessed. Results: Overall, 51 patients representing 19 % of the total cohort (33 male, age 67 (54,5 - 76,5) years) developed HH after CA with suc-cessful CPR. CA was witnessed in 48 (94 %) cases. Initial rhythm wasshockable (VT/VF) in 16 (31 %), non-shockable (PEA/Asystole) in 35 (69 %). Time to ROSC was 8,5 (2 -18,5) minutes.

Horvatits - University Medical Center Hamburg- Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A689 Introduction: Accumulation of serum bile acids (BAs) plays a central role in hepatic damage and disturbed BA signalling in liver disease. However, there is lack of data regarding the impact of serum BAs onclinical complications, acute decompensation (AD) and acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Objectives: Aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of circulat- ing serum BAs on clinical complications in patients with livercirrhosis.Methods: 143 patients with liver cirrhosis were included in this pro- spective observational study. Total serum BAs and individual BA com- position were assessed in all patients on admission. BAs wereanalyzed via high performance liquid chromatography. Clinical com-plications such as AD, ACLF and transplant-free survival were recorded. Results: Circulating total and individual BAs were significantly higher in patients with bacterial infection, AD and ACLF (p < 0.001). BAs fur-thermore correlated significantly with model of endstage liver dis- ease (MELD) and hepatic venous pressure gradient (p < 0.001). Total serum BAs were identified as independent predictor of decompensa-tion on admission (independently of sex, age and severity of liver dis-ease assessed via MELD score) (OR 1.017, 95%CI: 1.01-1.025, p < 0.001) and furthermore ACLF during follow-up (OR1.025, 95%CI:1.012-1.038, p < new onset of AD/ACLF and survival duringcourse of time was total BAs 36.9 mol/l. Conclusions: Circulating total and individual BAs are associated with AD and ACLF in patients with liver cirrhosis. Measurement of serumBAs could represent an additional marker for risk stratification incirrhotic patients with respect to new onset of decompensation and ACLF. A690 Long-term follow-up Horvatits, S.

Only 7patients (9 %) remained with terminal dialysis-dependent kidney in-sufficiency - 4 due to hepatorenal syndrome, 3 due to preexisting chronic renal insufficiency of other causes. 2 patients (3 %) received a kidney transplant (KT) during the prede-termined period of KALT bonus of 360 days. Another 5 patientsremained with need for RRT after expiry of the KALT option. One of them underwent RT in the Eurotransplant-senior-program. 4 (57 %) of these 7 patients had already been on RRT pre-LT.Overall mortality rate of those without necessity of RRT pre-LT was36 %, and 39 % in those with requirement of RRT pre-LT. In total 29 (37 %) of 78 patients died during follow-up. 38 % of these patients required RRT pre-LT, whereas 80 % needed RRT post-LT.Conclusions: 9 % (7/78) of patients undergoing LT with an option for KALT remained long-lasting with need for RRT. Only 3 % (2/78) received a kidney graft during the predetermined period of KALT option, whereas 5 (6 %) patients remained with necessity for RRT and subse-quent need for KT. In these 6 % of LT-patients KALT allocation systemwas not effective with respect to prioritize patients for early KT.

At present, extracorporealsystems for this purpose are based instead on plasma-adsorption. Objectives: We designed an in vitro and in vivo study. The in vitro study evaluated the system's adsorption capacity of bilirubin and theability to remove while the in vivo study veri-fied the congruence between in vitro and in vivo results and clinical outcomes. Methods: The in vitro study included 3 tests. Two tests were carried out with equimolar solution of Albumin(Alb)-Bilirubin(Bil), containingunconjugated Bil, strongly Alb-bound[1], to verify removal of protein- bound solutes.Test 3, 24 h long, was performed with higher concen- tration of Bil and lower of Alb, to study the kinetics of adsorption.The in vivo study is currently enrolling patients with severe hep-atic dysfunction with hyperbilirubinemia. Primary outcome is to evaluate in vivo Bil removal, whereas secondary outcomes are the hemodynamic stabilization, the reduction of inotropes, ithemprovement of hepatic function and inflammatory status.Results: The in vitro experiments showed the adsorption capacity of the system concerning Bil, also Alb-bound (Table 67), with a minimal Alb loss. We could not demonstrate any release of the adsorbed Bil.For the in vivo study, we enrolled until today, 3 patients (Table 68). Bil Mass Balance (MB) in vivo was higher than in vitro and showed the system's capacity of Bil removal, whereas removal rate (RR) is not significant for that purpose, being affected by many factors, first atall Bil production. In patient 3, Cytosorb was continuously used for4 days and it would seemed to favour reduction of inflammation, help the recovery of hepatic function, and the hemodynamic stabilization, with inotropic support interrupted already after 2 nd treatment.Conclusions: The in vitro study shows the effectiveness in removing Bil, also Alb-bound, for 24 h, without significant Alb loss. In vivo, Cytosorb is able to remove Bil in combination with cytokine removal,as reported in literature. Clinical effects suggest to be linked to theprecocity of treatment and the adequate dose. Its use might help in restoring organs function. Cytosorb might represent a simple aid in organ dysfunctions, that may work alone or in combination withCRRT. Other experiences are ongoing to confirm these data. References [1] Weber et al. Biomacromolecules 2008, 9 1322 -1328.

Objectives: To analyze the clinical characteristics, complications and hospital and a year evolution of patients admitted with a diagnosisof cirrhosis in an Intensive Care Unit. Methods: Retrospective observational study on a prospective database of 10 years duration. All patients admitted consecutively with primaryor secondary diagnosis of cirrhosis. Sociodemographic, clinical and de-velopmental variables are analyzed. The variables are expressed as means \u00b1 standard deviation, and absolute and relative frequencies. Comparisons between variables using the Student ttest and Pearson Chi2. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression. Analysis of survivalby Kaplan Meier curves and compared with the log rank test. Results: 229 patients were analyzed, mean age 58.6 \u00b1 13.1 years, and 78.6 % males. The most common etiologies were alcoholic in 149 pa-tients (65.1 %) and hepatitis C virus in 36 patients (15.7 %). The mostcommon reason for admission was upper gastrointestinal bleeding in 33.6 % followed by acute respiratory failure in 22.3 %. The most com- mon cause of respiratory infection was 51 cases (22.3 %) and the mostcommon cause of bleeding was esophageal varices in 65 cases(28.4 %).

A693 Indocyanine green for the initial evaluation of graft function after liver trasplant M.E. Herrera-Gutierrez, J. 4(Suppl 1): A693 Introduction: Evaluation of grafty function after liver trasplant (OLT) is a dificult task because diferent parameters must be taken into acount. De- termination of clearance of indocy anine green (ICG) has been proposed as a good method to measure liver function in diferent scenarios. Objective: To evaluate the capability of ICG elimination as a marker of development of graft dysfunction, kidney dysfunction or mortality. Material: Protective observational study. Series of cases. In our pa- tients we measured PDR and R-15 after a dose of 0,5 mgr/Kg IV of ICG by means of the Limon monitor (Pulsion\u00ae) the first day after OLT. We looked the relationship with AKIN-III, graft dysfunction (modified Toronto criteria) and in-hospital mortality. Analysis was performed by chi-square, Student t-test and area under curve (AuC). Results: 39 patients, age 55.7 \u00b1 11.3 years, 66,7%men. Mean hospital stay was 18.8 \u00b1 16 days. APACHE II at admission 13.8 \u00b1 3.6, SOFA 7.1 \u00b1 3.4, lactate 1.8 \u00b1 1.2 mm/L and PDR 19.5 \u00b1 14.5 %. In 15.4%patients a mild dysfunction was detected, without associ- ated mortality and 20.5 % developed severe dysfunction with a mortality of 37.55. In 15,4 % patients AKIN-3 was detected with a mortality of 7.7 %. None of the variables analyzed showed a good relationship with se- vere liver dysfunction [SOFA AuC 0.92(0.83-1, p 0,001) vs PDR 0.65(0.48-0.82, ns). 0.85(0.70-0.88, p0.048) but ICG only 0.64(0.39-0.88, ns). Conclusions: In our series, SOFA at admission and lactate levels seem the best predictors for outcome, clearly surpassing ICG clearance.A694 Plasmatic ionised calcium concentrations associated with worse outcomes in post-surgical ICU liver transplant patients A. Figueiredo, Y. Anzola, A694 Introduction: Plasmatic ionised calcium is vital for function and homeostasis of the human body. Plasmatic ionised calcium concentration (PICC) is afected by multiple clinical conditions such as endocrinopathies, organ disfunction, pH and albumin concentration. In the critically ill patient adequate PICC is even more important in the presence of neuro-muscular or cardio-vascular disfunction, coag- ulopathy, bleeding and massive transfusion. In adult critically ill patients calcium supplementation has been re- ported to improve 28-day survival [1]. Conversely, it has been shown that in septic patients calcium administration increases inflamatory signaling, multiorgan dysfunction and mortality [2]. The critical post liver transplant patient admitted in ICU can present with these conditions leading to altered PICC. Objectives: We analysed PICC of liver transplant patients and its as- sociation with ICU outcomes. Methods: Retrospective single-center study in liver transplant pa- tients admitted in ICU at a reference liver transplant center. PICC was analysed at admission and its trend in percentual diference from baseline (deltaPICC) reflected the initial 12 hours evolution period. Univariable analysis was performed to explore association with ICU lenght of stay (ILOS) and UCI vital outcome. Results: 140 cases were included in this study. In the ICU survivor group (n = 166) the mean PICC was 1.11 mmol/L (SD 0.12) and deltaPICC 3.04 % (SD 15.2 %). While in non-survivor the mean PICC (n = 9) was 1.17 mmol/L (SD 0.09) and deltaPICC (n = 7) was 16.1 % (SD 10.1 %). The diference between survivor and non-survivor was non significative for PICC (p = 0.15; IC95% for deltaPICC (p = 0.03; IC95% -24.5; 1.49). In the 3 or less days ILOS group (n = 60) the mean PICC was 1.10 mmol/L (SD 0.09); in the 4 or more days ILOS group (n = 67) the PICC was 1.15 mmol/L (SD 0.15). There was a significant PICC differ- ence between ILOS groups (p = 0.03; IC95% 0.003-0.09). Differences between deltaPICC between 3 or less days ILOS group (mean 1.15 %, SD 14.4 %) and 4 or more days ILOS (mean 1.16 %, SD 10.0 %) were not significative (p = 0.99; tients revealed longer ILOS significantly associated with higher PICC at ICU admission and a negative deltaPICC significantly associated with higher ICU mortality. Multivariate analysis will assess the independent value of calcemia as a risk factor in this ICU population. References 1. Zhang Z et al.

It is a highly demanding pro-cedure that carries a high number of complications, but outcome isregarded nowadays as excellent. We analyzed prospectively ten years ago the complications in our patients and wanted to evaluate if man- agement and results have changes in this ten years. Objective: To define the profile of early complications after OLT and its related variables and to compare them with our population fromten years ago. Material y methods: Observational prospective cohorts recruiting all patients admitted to our unit after OLT during 2013 -2015 (13-15) and retrospective comparison to a prospective cohort re- cruited from 2003 -2005 (03 -05). The transplantation team has not changed but a revision of the protocol had done during this interval (restriction in transfusion and volume infusion, immuno- suppression based on CysA and TAC and use of basiliximab forpatients with high risk for AKI). Definition of complications wasthe same but for AKI that was recalculated in the group 03 -05 according to AKIN criteria. Fir the analysis we performed chi- square y Student t-test.Results: Group 13 -15, 180 patients; group 03 -05, 131 patients. Equal gender, age and SOFA at admission but higher Child-C (28.9 % vs 13 %, p 0.004), higher percentage of arterial hypertension (32 vs 9.2, P 0,001) and previous renal disease (14.4 vs 6.1, p 0.032) for 13 -15. Transfusion during surgery was significantly lower for 13 -15 as well as volume infused (11.34 L vs 5.9 L for the first three postoperative days, p 0.054). We detected less reperfusion syndrome (19.4 vs 8.9 %, p 0.01) andcoagulopathy (23.4 vs 9.4 %, p 0.001) during surgery for 13 -15, an also a lower percentage of hypothermia (61.8 vs 17.2, p 0.0001), pul- monary edema (4.6 vs 0.6, p 0.04) or ARDS (8.4 vs 2.2, p 0.015) during the early postoperative course. Contrariwise, hyperglycemia was de-tected more frequently (78.5 vs 91.1 %, p 0.03).No changes were detected in AKI, need for RRT, encephalopathy, hemorrhages, infections or primary graph dysfunction. Mortality was 11.5 % for 03 -05 vs 6 % for 13 -15 (p ns). Conclusion Patients that opt for an OLT are sicker than before but this fact does not suppose a higher morbidity and we even detect a trend toward lower mortality. Changes in their management has sup- posed a lessening of intraoperative and respiratory complications.

Recent data provide evidence that GR expression is progressively decreasedin experimental sepsis and that dexamethasone has a decreased abil- ity to translocate into the cell nucleus1. Objectives: To evaluate the protein expression of the GR in periph- eral blood monocytes (m) and neutrophils (n) and the GR isoform a(GRa) mRNA in whole blood in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients with early-onset severe sepsis (SS) or systemic inflammatory response syn- drome (SIRS) compared to healthy control subjects (H). To relate theirexpression with serum levels of prolactin, cortisol and interleukins,plasma levels of ACTH, and to the expression of intracellular heat shock proteins 72 (HSP72) and HSP90 . Methods: Consecutively admitted patients with early (first 48 hours) SS (n = 48) or SIRS (n = 40) were admitted to a University Hospital ICUand enrolled in the study. 35 H were included. Total RNA was iso- lated from peripheral blood samples and cDNA was prepared. RT- PCR was performed using Light Cycler 480 Probes Master kit,employing primers and Taqman probes specifically designed forNR3C1 (GR ) and RPLP0 (used as control gene), on Light Cycler 480 System (Roche). Monocytes and neutrophils protein expression was evaluated by flow cytometry. Mean Fluorescence Intensity (MFI)values for HSPs and GR were after surface anti-gens CD33 CD45 evaluate interleukins. Results: GR MFI was significantly higher in SS compared to SIRS and H (p < 0.01) and was related to mHSP90 (p < 0.0001), nHSP90 (p < 0.0001), mHSP72 (p < 0.02), cortisol INF , IL-6, were in SS compared to SIRS and/or H. ACTH and expression levels of NR3C1 (GR) were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors (p < 0.02) and were related to ACTH (p < 0.0001), INF (p < 0.002), and IL-10 (p < 0.04). Conclusions: Sepsis and mortality are associated with early-onset in- creased GRa expression, which, apart from cortisol and ACTH, is alsorelated to HSP90 , HSP72 expression, well to cytokines.

MPs have been assessed as possible biomarkers of septic vascular dysfunction and sepsis-induced AKI [1]. However, the role of MPs in the crosstalk between coagulopathy and inflammation in sep-tic patients is still unclear. Objectives: The aim of this case -control study was to clarify the possible role of MPs as biomarkers in Septic Shock (SS) measur-ing Annexin V+ and endothelial-derived MPs in consecutive patients.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 356 of 607Methods: 21 patients (43 % M, 57 % F, 66 y) admitted to our ICU with a diagnosis of SS were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were: end- stage heart failure and liver disease, severe active cancer, age <18 years, pre-existent hematological disorders, ongoing anticoagula-tion and antiplatelet therapy. 21 healthy volunteers, age and sex matched, were recruited to estab- lish references values for MPs.Circulating MPs levels were measured at baseline (day 0) and24 hours later (day 1) by size and Annexin V- FITC labelling, using antibody [2]. The SOFA-score was determined over thefirst 24 hours and 28-day mortality was recorded. Data wereexpressed as medians, IQR or percentages. Correlations were assessed using Spearmann .T-test was used for comparison be- tween groups. Results: In critically ill patients V +Annexin and E selectin+MPs were significantly higher 97 (IQR 81 -127.5) MPs/ul at day 1, p < 0.01]. Spearmann's correlation between SOFA- scores (11, IQR 8 -14) and MPs revealed a moderate coefficient only with E selectin+MPs (r = 0.43, p < 0.038). No differences were noticed based on outcome. Furthermore, 11 patients had a diagnosis of sepsis-induced-AKI [18 % with stage 1 -2 and 82 % with stage 2 - 3,[1]) and once again their E selectin+MPs were higher than non-AKI septic patinets -352) MPs/ul, p < 0.03] at day 0. Conclusion Our preliminary data showed that endothelial MPs and V Annexin+MPs could be useful biomarkers of vascular damage. E selectin+MPs were strongly correlated to disease severity and renal failure. Sepsis-induced AKI probably occurs in the setting of a more severe microvascular dysfuction. Our results confirmed an important endothelial alteration, probably due to an abnormal release of Eselectin+MPs, during sepsis-induced AKI. In conclusion, MPs may be important therapeutic targets to prevent or treat SS. References 1. Uchino S, Kellum JA, Bellomo R, Doig GS, Morimatsu H,Morgera S, et al.

Study centres: ED of three community acute care centres in the Ni- agara Region, Ontario, Canada. Data collection: A dedicated Regional Sepsis Coordinator collected data on demographics, comorbidities, clinical symptoms, investiga-tions and managements. Institutional research ethics board approvalwas obtained. Results: A total of 2082 patients were included in the study. The me- dian age was 72 years (interquartile range, 60 -81), and the mean 194 \u00b1 156 min in the normal lactate group to 138 \u00b1 135 min in the high lactate group (p < 0.05). Total fluid administra- tion in first 6 hours increased from 1.9 \u00b1 1.3 L in the normal lactategroup to 3.2 \u00b1 1.9 L in the high lactate group (p < 0.05). Central lineinsertion rates increased from 8.8 % in normal lactate group to 47.8 % in the high lactate group (p < 0.05). Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission rate increased from 25.4 % in normal lactate group to54.5 % in high lactate group (p < 0.05). Unadjusted in-hospital mor-tality for normal, low, intermediate and high lactate group was 13.9 %, 21.7 %, 32.9 % and 57.2 %, respectively. Conclusions: Higher initial lactate level correlates with more inten- sive ED management of sepsis including earlier antibiotics adminis-tration, more fluid resuscitation, increase chance of central line insertion and ICU admission. It also correlates with higher unadjusted in-hospital mortality rate. References 1. Seymour CW, Liu VX, Iwashyna TJ, et al.

Comparison with procalcitonin andc-reactive proteinL. Garc\u00eda - Hospital Universitario Santa Luc\u00eda, Biochemistry Department, Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A699 Introduction: Sepsis is a usual condition handled in the emergency de- partment (ED) and, despite advances in antibiotic therapy and cardio-vascular and respiratory support, represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Presepsin is an emergent early biomarker for sepsis. Objective: To evaluate its diagnostic accuracy, compared to othertraditional biomarkers, such as procalcitonin and C-reactive protein,in a population presenting to emergency department (ED) with sus- pected sepsis. Methods: Study population : 223 patients (median age: 69 years [(Interquartile range (IQR: 31)]; 131 (58.7 %) male) with suspicion ofsepsis, according to 2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference criteria presenting at the ED were re- cruited. Definitive diagnosis was made according to the Third Inter-national Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).Laboratory methods : Blood samples were collected at first medical evaluation and analyzed for sepsis biomarkers. Presepsin concentra- tions were automated immunoassay analyser (PATHFAST).Statistical analysis : Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated to evaluate the diag- nostic performance of each biomarker and optimal cutoff valueswere derived from ROC curves. Values p < 0.05 were considered sta-tistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS v. 20.0 and and MedCalc statistical software v.14.8.1. Results: Sepsis was diagnosed in 70 (31.4 %) patients. According to the sepsis severity, septic patients were classified as sepsis [n = 57]and septic shock [n = 13]. C-reactive protein, procalcitonin and pre- sepsin levels were higher in septic patients than in patients without sepsis [17.0 (21.3) mg/dL vs.13.0 than that of C-reactive protein(0.830 [95 % CI 0.55-0.68]). The corresponding procalcitonin and pre-sepsin thresholds were 1.56 ng/mL (sensitivity 67 % and specificity 86 %) and 849 pg/mL (sensitivity 67 % and specificity 83 %). Conclusion Presepsin was a valuable biomarker for diagnosis of sep- sis in an ED, with a similar diagnostic accuracy than procalcitonin.Further research is needed to clarify the role of biomarkers after than sepsis definition has been updated.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of C- reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) to differentiate be-tween VAT and VAP on the day of infection diagnosis.Methods: Post-hoc analysis of the large prospective multinational TAVeM database, coming from 114 ICUs in Europe and Latin America (1). All consecutive patients receiving mechanical ventilation for>48 h were included in the TAVeM database. We compared VAT andVAP at the day of infection diagnosis. Only first episodes of VAT and VAP were taken into account. Results: Four hundred and four patients (mean age 60 years, 238 men, ICU mortality 35 %) were studied, 207 with VAT and 197 withVAP. On the day of infection diagnosis, the median CRP was elevated in both groups but significantly higher in VAP (14 mg/dl and 18 mg/ dl, p = .001). PCT was also significantly higher in VAP (0.64 ng/dl and2.1 ng/dl, p < .001). However, roughly 25 % VAT patients and 16 % ofVAP patients had PCT values < 0.25 ng/dl, while 14 % VAT patients and 7 % of VAP patients had CRP values < 4.0 mg/dl. Dividing the pa- tients in sepsis, severe sepsis and septic shock, the levels of PCT weresignificantly different between the three groups (p = 0.008) and thatwas not the case for CRP (p = 0.097). Conclusions: Both CRP and PCT in patients with suspected ventilator associated lower respiratory tract infection were higher in VAP thanVAT. PCT presented a higher false negative rate. The level of PCTshowed a good correlation with clinical severity. References 1. Martin-Loeches I et al.

Elevated blood lactate concentra- tions are conventionally viewed as a surrogate of hypoperfusion and tissue hypoxia. Despite its limitations hyperlactatemia is an inde-pendent predictor of mortality and thus it was included in the mostrecent septic shock definition. However, both the evolution and the time to normalization of lactate in representative cohorts of septic patients receiving vasopressors are largely unknown.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 358 of 607Objectives: Our aim was to investigate the evolution of blood lactate level over time and its relationship to 90-day mortality in critically ill septic patients with hypotension and in patients with septic shockaccording to the recently revised definition.Methods: We performed a post-hoc analysis from the prospective, observational, multicenter FINNAKI study. We analyzed 513 septic pa- tients with hypotension, lactate recordings within 4 hours of ICU ad-mission and repeat recordings of lactate during the ICU. 265 patientsfulfilled the new definition for septic shock. The primary outcome was the association of time-weighted mean lactate during ICU stay with 90-day mortality.Results: The 90-day mortality for all patients was 33.3 %. In patients with admission lactate of > 2 mmol/L the 90-day mortality was higher than in those with an admission lactate of 2 mmol/L (43.4 % vs 22.5 %, respectively p < 0.001). Patients with persistent lactatemia(>2 mmol/L) at 72 hours had higher 90-day mortality comparedthose with a lactate value of 2.0 mmol/L (52.0 % vs. 24.3 %, respect- ively, survivors, mmol/L vs. 1.29 (0.98-1.77) mmol/L, p < 0.001. The median timeto normalization of lactate was similar for survivors and non- survivors (15.0 (5.0-35.0) vs 17.0 (3.5-43.5) hours, p = 0.67). In separate backwards logistic regression analyses time-weighted mean lactate,the lactate value at 72 hours, and a lactate value over 2 mmol/L at72 hours (dichotomous variable) were independently associated with 90-day mortality, but admission lactate or time to normalization of lactate were not.Conclusions: In septic patients with hypotension, and in those who additionally had hyperlactatemia, time-weighted mean lactate, lac- tate values at 72 hours, and persisting hyperlactatemia at 72 hours were independently associated with 90-day mortality, but time tonormalization of lactatemia and admission lactate were not.

A702 Adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 are associated myocardialinjury and death in septic shock patients O.H.M. University Hospital, Infectious Diseases, University, Linkoping, Skane University Hospital, Intensive and Perioperative Care, Malm\u00f6, Sweden Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A702 Introduction: Adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 are hormones with opposing effects on the cardiovascular system. Adrenomedullin acts as a vasodilator and seems to be important for the initiation and continuation of the hyperdynamic circulatory response in sepsis.Endothelin-1 is a vasoconstrictor and has been linked to decreasedcardiac performance. Few studies have studied the relationship be- tween adrenomedullin and endothelin-1 and morbidity and mortality in septic shock patients. High-sensitivity troponin T (hsTNT) is nor-mally used to diagnose acute cardiac injury but is also prognostic foroutcome in intensive care. Objectives: We investigated mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin (MR-proADM), and myocardial injury, measured using transthoracicechocardiography and hsTNT in septic shock patients. We were also interested in the development of different biomarkers throughout the ICU stay, and how early measurements were re-lated to mortality. Further, we assessed if a positive biomarkerpanel, consisting of MR-proADM, CT-proET-1 and hsTNT changed the odds for mortality. Methods: A cohort of 53 consecutive patients with septic shock had their levels of MR-proADM, CT-proET-1, hsTNT and left ventricular sys-tolic functions prospectively measured over 7 days. The relationship between day 1 levels of MR-proADM/CT-proET-1 and myocardial in- jury was studied. We also investigated the relationship between bio-markers and early (7 day) as well as later (28 day) mortality.Likelihood ratios, pre-and posttest odds for mortality were calculated. Results: Levels of MR-proADM and CT-proET-1 were significantly higher among patients with myocardial injury and were correlatedwith left ventricular systolic dysfunction. MR-proADM and hsTNTwere significantly higher among 7 and 28 day non-survivors. CT- proET-1 was also significantly higher among 28 but not 7 day non- survivors. A positive biomarker panel consisting of the three bio-markers increased the odds for mortality 13-20-fold.Conclusions: MR-proADM and CT-proET-1 are associated with myo- biomarker panel combining MR-proADM, CT-proET-1 and hsTNT increases the odds ratio for death, and may improve cur-rently available scoring systems in critical care.Grant acknowledgement Region Halland County Council A703 Circulating levels of advanced glycation end products (AGES) areassociated with 28-day mortality in septic Rodriguez-Ruiz Cl\u00ednico Universitario, Intensive Care Unit, Santiago de Compostela, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A703 Introduction: Multiple biomarkers have been studied to assess sepsis severity and prognosis. The pathological role of the advanced glyca- tion end products (AGEs) has become increasingly evident in numer- ous types of diseases. A large number of papers have shown thatcirculating levels of AGEs are elevated under inflammatory and/ordiabetic conditions, and associated with cardiovascular disease. Also, accumulation of AGEs in various tissues, progresses at a physiological normal aging, and at an extremely accelerated rate under hyperglice-mic, inflammatory, and/or oxidative stress conditions.Objectives: Our aim was to study the dynamics of the plasma circu- lating levels of AGEs, and of the accumulated AGEs in the skin in sep- tic patients during the first 5 days of the septic process, and theirassociation with (i) APACHE II, (ii) SOFA on days 1 to 5, and (iii) mor-tality at day 28. Methods: We assessed 48 consecutive patients admitted to our ICU with the diagnosis of sepsis. We determined for 5 consecutive daysplasma circulating AGEs and skin AGEs. Plasma AGEs were measuredby quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of plasma accord- ing to the method of Munch et al. (1) in a multi-mode microplate reader (Synergy 2, Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA), and results wereexpressed as arbitrary units (AU). Skin autofluorescence was mea-sured with the AGE Reader mu (DiagnOptics, Groningen, The Netherlands) (2). We correlated these results with the APACHE II, daily SOFA, and mortality at day 28.Results: There were 43 survivors and 5 non-survivors. We did not find association between plasma AGEs on days 1 to 5, and APACHE II or SOFA on days 1 to 5; neither between skin autofluorescence on days 1 to 5, and APACHE II or SOFA on days 1 to 5.When analyzing mortality at day 28, we found that on day 1, plasmaAGEs in non-survivors were significantly higher = 0.742, p= 0.079), determined a trend but not power enough to predict 28-day mortality. On days 2 to 5, we did not findIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 359 of 607differences in plasma AGEs between non-survivors and survivors. Skin autofluorescence on days 1 to 5, did not show association with 28-day mortality.Conclusion: In our cohort of septic patients, increased plasma levels of AGEs on day 1, are associated with 28-day mortality. Circulating AGEs become an early biomarker in septic patients, and its prognos- tic efficacy needs to be determined in a larger study. References (1) Munch G. et al .

A704 A study of patients with sepsis who have discrepancy between lactate levels and ScvO2Y. Kishihara, H. YasudaMusashino Red Cross Hospital, Tokyo, Japan Correspondence: Y. Kishihara - Musashino Red Cross Hospital, Tokyo, Japan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A704 Introduction: The usefulness of lactate levels and ScvO2 is well known in treating patients with sepsis. We have encountered dis-crepancies between lactate levels and ScvO2, but the reason for thisdiscrepancy is unknown. Objectives: Our hospital joined the transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) study, which is a multicenter, prospective, randomized con-trolled trial. Inclusion criteria were ICU patients with sepsis undergo-ing mechanical ventilation. Various data were collected using TPTD and compared with CVP for transfusion. Primary outcome was ventilator-free days and secondary outcomes were ICU length of stay,28-day mortality, and length of hospital stay. We used these studydata to determine factors associated with the discrepancy between lactate clearance and ScvO2. Methods: Based on TPTD study data, we subdivided patients into the following four groups: ScvO2 70 % and lactate level 4 mmol/L (HH group), ScvO2 70 % and lactate level < 4 mmol/L (HL group), ScvO2 < 70 % and lactate level 4 mmol/L (LH group), and ScvO2 < 70 % and lactate level < 4 mmol/L (LL group). Evaluations includedthe SOFA score, SAPS II score, lactate level, ScvO2, BNP, etc. We alsoanalyzed mortality at 28 days, duration of mechanical ventilation, use of renal replacement therapy, duration of catecholamine use, and ICU length of stay.Results: In total, 57 patients were included: HH group (n = 11), HL group (n = 24), LH group (n = 6), and LL group (n = 16). There were no differences in patients' characteristics or change in lactate levels, CVP, and ScvO2 from 24 h to 72 h. Mortality at 28 days was 3/6(50 %) in the LH group, 3/11 (27.3 %) in the HH group, 3/16 (18.8 %)in the LL group, and 3/24 (12.5 %) in the HL group (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, the odds of 28-day mortality were 8.16 (95 % CI: 0.2-275) in the LH group, 1.46 (95 % CI: 0.05-26.8) in the HHgroup, and 1.34 (95 % CI: 0.17-11.1) in the LL group.Conclusions: Mortality at 28 days was highest in the LH group and lowest in the HL group. These data are not conflicted our experience and past studies. Because 28-day mortality was higher in the HHgroup than in the LL group, it is possible that lactate levels are morepredictive of mortality.References the prognostic utility in patients with severe sepsis or septic shock in intensive care unit S.

Rebollo - Hospital General Universitario Santa Lucia, Intensive Care, Cartagena, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A705 Introduction: Sepsis is a leading cause of death in critically ill pa- tients despite improvements in antimicrobial therapy and supportive care. Early identification of patients at high risk of dying after inten-sive care unit (ICU) admission may help determine therapeuticinterventions. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of N-terminal pro- brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) for in-hospital mortality in a cohort of patients admitted to ICU with sepsisands and septic shock. Methods: Patients: (53.2 %)] with diagnosis of sepsis and septic shock, according tothe Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and SepticShock (Sepsis-3), admitted to ICU between October 2013 and March 2014 were enrolled. Measurements: Blood tests for C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin(PCT) and NT-proBNP analyses were drawn on the day of admission and48 hours later. Patients' demographic data and severity scores (APACHE II, SAPS and SOFA) were collected. In-hospital mortality was defined as outcome. For measurement of NT-proBNP, a chemiluminescent inmu-noassay (NT-proBNP Cobas 8000 Roche Diagnostic) were used. Statistical analysis: Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and areas under the curves (AUCs) were calculated to evaluate the prog-nostic value for in-hospital mortality of NT-proBNP of each biomarkerand optimal cutoff value was derived from ROC curves. Value p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS v. 20.0 and and MedCalc statistical softwarev.14.8.1.Results: In-hospital mortality rate was 34 % (16 of 47). NT-proBNP levels at admission were significantly higher in non-survivors (me- < 0.001), and the difference remained after48 hrs (p = 0.001). The ROC of admission and 48-hours NT-proBNP levels for in-hospital mortality resulted in AUC values of 0.88 (95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.77-0.99; p < 0.001) and 0.82 (95 % CI: 0.66-0.99; p < 0.001), respectively, with a similar performance than that ofSOFA (0.84 95%CI:0.78-0.98; p < 0.001). There were not differences among survivors and non-survivors for PCT andCRP on admission and 48-hours PCT and CRP.Conclusions: NT-proBNP values are frequently increased in sepsis and septic shock. Values are significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors. Although NT-proBNP on admission and at 48 hoursIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 360 of 607showed a good performance for prognosis of in-hospital mortality, with AUC ROC > 0.8 for both, they did not improve the value of se- verity scores usually used in ICUs. A706 Diagnostic value of systemic interleukin-1 receptor antagonist forventilator associated pneumonia in a porcine model of mechanical ventilation G. Li Bassi1, R. College, Dublin, Ireland Correspondence: G. Li Bassi - Hospital Clinic, Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine, Barcelona, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A706 Introduction: We previously investigated efficacy of a new ventila- tory strategy - aimed at promoting mucus clearance and preventingpulmonary aspiration - or the Trendelenburg position for the preven-tion of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) (1). Objectives: We now appraise patterns of systemic inflammation to identify blood inflammatory biomarkers that could detect VAP orventilator-associated tracheobronquitis (VAT). Also, we evaluated theeffects of the Trendelenburg position on systemic inflammation. Methods: Twenty-one pigs were intubated and on mechanical venti- lation (MV) for 72 hours. Following surgical preparation, pigs wererandomized to be positioned: 1) in semirecumbent/prone position,ventilated with a duty cycle (T ITTOT) of 0.33 and without PEEP (con- trol); 2) as in the control group, PEEP of 5 cm H 2O, and T ITTOTto achieve a mean expiratory-inspiratory flow bias of 10 L/min (treat-ment); 3) in Trendelenburg/prone position and ventilated as in thecontrol group (Trendelenburg). Following randomization, P. aerugi- nosa was instilled into the oropharynx. Prior to bacterial challenge, and every 24 hours thereafter, blood was drawn for quantification ofserum interferon (INF)-Gamma; interleukin pro- tein were clinically suspected and confirmedby histological/microbiological studies.Results: Overall, ten animals developed VAP (4 controls, 6 treatments and 0 Trendelenburg), four animals VAT (1 control, 0 treatments, 3 Trendelenburg) and 6 did not develop any pulmonary infection (1control, 1 treatment and 4 Trendelenburg). Median [IR] tracheal aspir-ate quantitative culture of 6.5 [0.4] log10 cfu/mL (p = and P.aeruginosa pulmonary burden was 0 [1.6], 0 [0.9] and 2.2 [4.3] in animals without infection or thatdeveloped VAT and VAP, respectively (p < 0.001). INF- , IL-1Ra, IL-4, IL-8 and IL-18 concentrations (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Multivariate analyses showed that cyto- kines did not predict VAT; yet, IL-1Ra was strongly associated withVAP (odds ratio 64.941 (CI 1.638 - 999), area under the ROC curve 0.85 (0.64-1.00). A value of 1.21 log pg/mL appeared to diagnose VAP most accurately (sensitivity 90 %, specificity 80 %). Conclusions: In a reliable animal model of MV and acquired pulmonary infections, IL-1Ra predicts P.aeruginosa VAP with good diagnostic accur- acy. Consistently with previous findings, the Trendelenburg position re- duced incidence of VAP, and decreas ed inflammation during MV. Further clinical studies are warranted to confirm these preliminary findings.References 1) Li Bassi G et al.

The mortality remains unchanged, despite advances in treatment and theclinical judgement is still insufficient to an early recognition of out- comes in children with sepsis. Objective: To evaluate the patterns of C-Reactive Protein (CRP) ratio response to antibiotic therapy during the first 7 days in the PaediatricIntensive Care Unit (PICU) in children admitted with sepsis. Methods: This is a multicenter, prospective and descriptive cohort study of children (1 month to 18 years old) admitted at PICUs of 3 ter-tiary hospitals in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with sepsis diagnosis (less than72 hours). CRP was sampled every other day during the first week of antibiotic therapy (from D0 to D6). CRP-ratio was calculated in relation to D0 CRP value. Patients were classified according to an individual pat-tern of CRP-ratio response with the following criteria: fast D4 CRP was 0.4 concentration; slow - when D4 CRP was > 0.4 and D6 0.8 of D0 CRP concentration (continuous and slow response); nonresponse - CRP was > 0.8 of D0 CRPconcentration; biphasic response - characterized by an initial CRP de-crease to levels < 0.8 of the D0 CRP followed by a secondary rise > 0.8. We performed comparison between PICU survivors and non-survivors. Results: This cohort included 99 patients (age median: 1.8; 52.5 % male); the most frequent sites of infection were lung (58.6 %), centralnervous system (13.1 %), abdominal (7.1 %) and urinary (5.1 %). Out of the 99 patients, 88 could be classified according to a predefined pattern: 26.1 % fast response, 54.6 % slow response, 10.2 % nonre-sponse and 9.1 % biphasic response. The ICU mortality rate was sig-nificantly different (p < 0.001) according to the patterns of CRP-ratio response: fast response 4.3 %, slow response 2.1 %, nonresponse 44.4 % and biphasic response 37.5 %. Besides, the time dependentanalysis of CRP-ratio and CRP course of the different patterns wassignificantly different (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In paediatric sepsis, sequential evaluation of CRP-ratio was useful in the early identification of patients with poor outcome.The identification of CRP-ratio pattern of response to antibiotics dur-ing the first week of antibiotic therapy could be useful in the recog- nition of the individual clinical evolution, influencing clinical decision-making process at bedside.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl - Hospital Virgen del Rocio, Seville, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A708 Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyse the relationship between tissue hypoxia, levels of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1 , a factor that activates gene expression in response to in- flammatory and hypoxaemic conditions) and the innate immuneresponse in patients with septic shock, and its relationship with mortality. Method: Prospective observational study in patients with septic shock and healthy volunteers (controls) to analyse normal values Individuals signed an informed consent and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee. Tissue hypoxia wasmonitored by non-invasive transcutaneous spectroscopy (NIRS). At in-clusion, 3rd and 7th day, venous blood samples were obtained for determinations above were obtained. Lactate was determined at baseline, every 6 hours the first day and daily until day 3. Quantita-tive variables expressed as median [IQR]. Statistical analysis: Mann - Whitney test ranges with Wilcoxon test and Spearman rho; it was considered significant a value of p < 0.05. Results: Eleven patients with septic shock were included, 72.7 % males (8 cases), median age 67 years [58 -73] and 10 healthy con- trols. The clinical severity APACHE II at ICU admission was 21 [17 -25]. ICU mortality was 19 % (2 cases). At inclusion all patients had respiratory failure (SOFA respiratory 2, SaO2 76.3 [49 -70]), and SOFA 9 [7.5-11.5]. All patients had of leukocytes, CRP, serum lactate and pyruvate. Pyruvate levels were higher in patients than in controls.HIF-1 was higher in patients, reaching peak levels on day 3rd (2.06 times the inclusion day). In patients: a) levels of HLA-DR on mono- cytes circulating inclusion day were 2.86 times lower than in controls; b) IL-6 and IL-10 levels in patients were higher than in controls onthe day of inclusion, with marked reduction at day 3rd (26.25 and6.98 times respectively), IL6 was 1088.49 pg/ml in patients being undetect- able in controls; c) there were no differences in HIF-1 , IL-6, IL-10 and tissue hypoxia between dead and survivors. In the follow up, aninverse relationship between pyruvate and HIF-1 levels was observed. Conclusions: Patients with septic shock show peripheral tissue hyp- oxia. HIF-1 appears high and rising until the third day of monitoring, which despite a decrease in the levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in those days was observed.

Zhang - University of Pittsburgh, Department of Chemical Engineering, Pittsburgh, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A709 Introduction: The high inter- and intra-patient variability and con- founding factors during early sepsis has made it difficult to diagnoseand characterize. Despite this variability, serum cytokine levels such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) during sepsis appear to follow consistent and distinctive trajectories across patients.Objectives: To classify septic patients into groups defining endotypes of sepsis using longitudinal IL-6 trajectories and to estimate time of sepsis onset. Methods: The multicenter, randomized Protocol-Based Care for Early Septic Shock (ProCESS) trial enrolled 1341 patients with septic shockand showed a 16.3 % 14-day mortality. Patients with IL-6 measured at 0, 6, 24, and 72 hours after enrollment were selected for this ana- lysis. Those with IL-6 values below the lower limit of detection orwith missing measurements were excluded, leaving 164 patients foranalysis. Each IL-6 trajectory was modeled as a differential equation evolving in response to inflammation. 3 classes of differential equations wereused to enforce classification into specific dynamic behaviors: over-damped response, under-damped response, and overshoot-type re- sponse. Patient classification was performed based on best data fit to one of the 3 possible responses.Within each class of response, a Gaussian Mixture model on differen-tial equation parameters was used to further classify each patient. The centers of each cluster generated a characteristic IL-6 response to sepsis (a master curve) for that sub-population. Aligning each pa-tient along with their category master curve provided an estimatefor disease time-zero with respect to onset of sepsis. Results: Subgroup analysis revealed a total of 5 distinct IL-6 re- sponses: 1-high response and fast decline; 2- slow and protracted re-sponse; 3- fast response and protracted decline; 4- small responseand fast decline; 5- sustained response. Statistical testing of clinical biomarkers between clusters revealed significant differences across 12 hour bins following disease onset. There were notable differencesin vital signs, bilirubin, lactate, and urine output, between and physiological vari- ables. This suggests that endotypes can be informed from easy and minimally-invasive measurements. Finally, endotypes were associatedwith distinct low and high mortality outcome. Endotype 5 exhibitedparticularly high mortality. Conclusions: A novel data-driven approach is proposed to generate sepsis endotypes and disease time-zero. The clusters providedphysiological characterization of phenotypes. The knowledge of dis-ease time as well as endotype risk can be used to guide treatments in order to shift sepsis patients towards better outcomes.

Norberg, J. Oras University SwedenCorrespondence: J. Oras - University of Gothenburg, Institue of Clinical Sciences, Gothenburg, Sweden Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A710 Introduction: Acute cardiac events are common after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) and are associated with an increased risk of poor outcome (1 -3). However, the impact of cardiac events on long term mortality after SAH are barely studied (4).Objectives: The aim was to evaluate the impact on acute cardiac events on long-term mortality after SAH. Our hypothesis was that these events are associated with an increased long-term mortality. Methods: This is a retrospective study. Medical records from all pa- tients admitted to our NICU from 2010 to 2015 with the diagnosisSAH were analysed. Admission variables obtained were age, medical history, WFNS score, modified fischer grade. Cardiac varibales ob- tained were and NTproBNP levels, and Cox-regression were used in thestatistical analyses.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 362 of 607Results: A total of 708 patients were admitted with suspected/ verified SAH during the study period. 118 patients did not fulfill SAH-diagnosis, 33 patients were not included due to long time to admission (>4 days). Cardiac variables were found in the fol- lowing number of patients; troponin levels n = 428, NTproBNP levels n = 342, ECG n = 454, echocardiography n = 235. In 28 pa- tients no ECG/echo/cardiac biomarkers were found. Of the 529 patients analysed, 109 patients had died at the time mortalily data was obtained (April 2016). In a univariate cox-regression analysis, WFNS grade 4 -5, Fisher grade, age, history of hyperten- sion, cardiovascular disease (CVD) or renal disease, levels of troponin and NTproBNP and ST-elevations or negative T-waves had a significant higher risk (hazard ratio) for death. Stress- cardiomyopathy was not significantly associated with an inreased risk of death. Fig. 96shows a Kaplan Meier curve of cumulative survival in patients with troponin release, divided in upper or lower quartiles. In a multivariable cox-regression analysis, both troponin levels (Table 70) and NTproBNP levels were significantly associated with an increased risk for death when adjusting for the most important admission variables; WNFS grade 4 -5, age and history of CVD or renal disease. However, these differences were only significant the first year after the hemorrhage. Conclusions: Acute realease of the cardiac biomarkers troponin and NTproBNP after SAH is an omnious clinical sign which is associated with an increased risk of death, especially the first year after the hemorrhage. Further research is needed to address whether mea- sures to optimize cardiac treatment after SAH might improve survival. References (1) Oras et al., Critical Care 2016.

Cuisinier1, of Integrative Cardiovascular and Metabolic 4(Suppl 1): A711 Introduction: The concept of brain-heart interaction (1) has been de- scribed in several brain injuries. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) may also lead to cardiac dysfunction but evidences are mainly based upon ex- perimental (2) and clinical retrospective studies (3). Objectives: The present study aimed at evaluating myocardial func- tion at the early phase of TBI using conventional 2D echocardiog- raphy and complementary STE analysis. We hypothesized that patients with TBI had altered cardiac function compared to the con- trol group. Methods: We conducted a prospective case -control study in a level I trauma center. Twenty consecutive adult patients with severe TBI were matched according to age and gender with twenty control patients. Contro l group included adult patients undergoing general anesthesia f or peripheral trauma surgery. Conventional and Speckle Tracki ng Echocardiography (STE) was performed within the first 24 post-traumatic hours in the TBI group and PRE/PER-operative in the control group. Primary end- point was left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) measured by diastolic analysis. Results: We found similar LVEF between the TBI group and the PER-operative control group (61 % [56 -76]) vs. 62 % [52 -70]). LV morphological parameters and systolic function were also similar between the two groups. Regarding diastolic function, isovolumic relaxation time was significantly higher in the TBI cohort (125 s [84-178] versus 107 s [83 -1 4 1 ] ,p = 0 . 0 4 ) ,s u g g e s t i n gs u b c l i n i c a l diastolic dysfunction. Using STE parameters, we observed a trend toward higher strains in the TBI group but only apical circumfer- ential strain and basal rotation reached statistical significance. STE-derived parameters of diastolic function tended to be lower in TBI patients. Conclusions: No systematic myocardial depression was found in a cohort of severe TBI patients. STE rather revealed correct adapta- tion of left systolic function, while diastolic function slightly impaired.

Brussels, Belgium; 2Sapienza University, Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Rome, Italy;3Hospital Clinic Universitari, Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Valencia, Spain;4St Mary Hospital and Charing Cross Hospital Imperial College NHS Trust, Department of Anaesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK;5CHU Dijon, Department of Anesthesia and Intensive Care, Dijon, France Correspondence: S. Arib - Hopital Erasme, Department of Intensive Care, Brussels, Belgium Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A712 Introduction: In patients brain metabolism through microdialysis catheters has re- vealed a decrease in brain glucose concentrations during intensive insulin therapy to control hyperglycemia. However, the use of such catheters is not routinely applied. No data are available on glucose concentrations into the cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) of these patients during insulin therapy (IT). Methods: We reviewed data in all patients admitted after a non- traumatic SAH over a 4-year period (2011 -2014) in 5 ICUs. Inclusion criteria were: a) age > 18 years; b) presence of an external ventricular drain (EVD) for intracranial pressure monitoring; c) daily analysis of CSF including glucose concentrations for at least 4 consecutive days; d) concomitant analysis of glucose concentrations on the arterial blood gas analysis. Demographics and clinical characteristics were recorded on admission as well as the need for continuous IT (target glucose levels: 110 -150 mg/dL) and 3-month neurological outcome (favourable outcome was defined as a Glasgow Outcome Scale of 4 -5). Results: Of a total of 724 patients admitted with SAH, 335 needed an EVD and 144 met the inclusion criteria for the final analysis (median age: 58 [49 -66] years; male gender: 77/144). Median time EVD placement was 1 [0 -3] days; EVD was maintained for a period of 7 [4 -12] days. Of the 115 identified aneurysms, 83 were treated with endovascular therapy. Median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission was 10 [7 -13] and CT-scan Fisher scale was 4 [3 - 4]. A total of 46 (32 %) died during the ICU stay and 63 (44 %) had afavourable neurological outcome. Patients receiving IT on the first day of EVD monitoring (n = 72) had more frequently diabetes (27/72 vs. 4/72; p < 0.001) but similar GCS and Fisher scales than those with- out IT. Together with a higher CSF red blood cells count (65210 [11900 -94192] vs. 24650 [6020 -64188]/mm3; p = 0.006) and similar white blood cells and proteins levels, patients receiving IT had higher blood glucose (180 [151 -222] vs. 140 [118 -155] mg/dL; p < 0.001) and similar CSF (89 [66 -108] vs. 81 [72 -92] mg/dL; p = 0.13) than those without IT. Thus, the ratio between CSF and blood glucose levels was significantly lower in patients receiving IT than others (0.51 [0.36-0.61] vs. 0.60 [0.49-0.70]; p = 0.006). Conclusions: Insulin therapy resulted in lower proportion of glucose available in the CSF in patients with SAH. The impact of such findings on cerebral recovery and outcome needs to be further evaluated. A713 Serial MRI for outcome prediction after aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage Granda Ospedale Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A713 Introduction: The immediate events associated with aneurysmal sub- arachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) result in early brain injury (EBI). De- layed cerebral ischemia (DCI) may also develop between 1 -2 weeks after bleeding caused by vasospasm and other mechanisms. Charac- terizing both type of brain injury and standardising the diagnostic modalities is key to predicting and potentially modifying the out- come of SAH. Objectives: Use serial MR imaging to determine the characteristics of early and late brain injury and investigate their role in determining outcome after SAH. Methods: Patients' demographic and clinical data were collected. 6- months outcome was evaluated using the extended GOS (GOS-E). Serial MRI scans were performed on days 0 -5 (early), and 7 -14 (late) following the acute bleeding. The MRI protocol included 3D-T1, T2, T2*-weighted sequences, 3D-FLAIR, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (ADC) were calculated. FLAIR, DWI/ ADC and T2 sequences were co-registered and volumes measured using the SPM and Analyze software. Early cerebral ische- mia (ECI) and DCI were identified as hyper/hypointense lesions on the correspondent DWI/ADC maps. DWI were classified on the basis of the whole lesion volume: none (N), spotty (SP), 10 ml (S = small), and > 10 ml (L = large). Early cerebral haematomas (ECH) were identi- fied on FLAIR and T2 and similarly classified as none (N), small (S) and large (L). All early lesions (excluding SP lesions) were named as EBI (ECI + ECH). Chi square test and logistic regression were used for univariable and multivariable analysis. Results: 82 SAH patients (53 F and 29 M) were enrolled, with a me- dian age of 57 (IQR 48 -66). 54 subjects (66 %) had good grade (WFNSS 1 -3) and 28 (34 %) poor grade SAH (WFNS 4 -5) on admis- sion. 67 patients (82 %) were coiled while 14 were surgically treated (17 %) and one was not treated. Vasospasm (defined as \"late \"clinical deterioration associated to instrumental finding of arterial narrowing) occurred in 22 patients (27 %). MRI abnormalities compatible with ECI were found in 34 subjects (42 %), 22 classified as S lesions (65 %) and 12 as L (35 %). 40 patients (49 %) had ECH (25 S and 15 L le- sions), including 4 small subdural haematomas (SDH) and 2 with both SDH and ECH. DCI was observed in 38 % of the cases (N = 31), 27 classified as S lesions and 4 as L. The Table 71shows the results of the univariable analysis for factors related to outcome. Multivariable logistic regression analysis shows an association be- tween worse outcome and poor WFNSS on admission (OR 6.3, 95 % CI, 2 -20), the presence of DCI (OR 4.2, 95 % CI 1.4-13) and EBI (OR 1.3, 95 % CI 1.3-15). Fig. 97 (abstract A711). Primary outcome LVEF (%)Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 364 of 607Conclusions: These findings show that early and delayed brain injury are both independent predictors of worse outcome after SAH, and suggest that standard MRI protocols are useful diagnostic tools. Sig-nificant variance in outcome still remains, indicating that additionalmethods may be necessary to quantify brain damage after SAH. A714 Brain injury biomarkers and inflammatory markers as prognostic factors in patients with intracerebral hemorraghe H.B. Guia, Garc\u00eda Simon, A. Hospital Clinic Universitari Valencia, Valencia, Spain Correspondence: H.B. Rotzel - Hospital Clinic Universitari Valencia, Valencia, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl A714 for 9-27 % of cerebrovascular diseases worldwide, with 37 -52 % of mortality at 30 days and 54 % a year. Brain injury biomarkers (BIB) and inflammatory markers (IM) have been studied to predict progno- sis in this disease.Objectives: To associated BIB and IM with mortality and functional outcome in patients with spontaneous ICH. Methods: We performed a prospective observational study, with pa- tients admitted in ICU with spontaneous ICH. BIB were determined(Enolase, S-100B, Dimer D (DD), BNP, CRP) and IM (transferrin, prealbumin, Quick index (QI), at admission and 7thday. APACHE II, SOFA, GCS, GRAEB were determined at admission and the modified Rankin Scale (mRS:poor outcome >2) and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS: poor outcome< 4) at ICU discharge. Variables were summarized using %, mean (SD) and median (minimal/ maximum). We used T-Student and 2( p < 0.05) for univariable analysis. We conducted a multivariable analysisfor mortality with binary logistic regression (95 % CI, OR) p < 0,05. Weobtained a ROC curve for those variables that were independent fac- tors for mortality. Results: We enrolled 120 patients, 68 % were men, mean age 62 years(\u00b112.6). Global mortality was 34.2 %. 83.3 % were supraten-torial and 16.7 % infratentorial. Mean APACHE II 14 (\u00b16, 5) and GCS 10.4 (\u00b14,1) and median SOFA 4 (0 -14) and hematoma volume 21,35 cc3 (1 -252). In the univariable analysis a worse outcome (with mRS and GOS) was significantly associated with APACHE II, SOFA,GCS at admission (p 0,000 each one), length of stay (LOS)-ICU and days of mechanical ventilation (p 0,000). The BIB and IM related with a worse mRS were DD at 1, 2 3 3rdday (p 0,039, 0,001, 0,002); and with a worse GOS were DD 2 and 3rdday (p 0,015 and 0,002), S-100B and CRP at 2ndday (p 0,04 and 0,009). Otherwise, mortality was associated with BNP at admission, 1,2, 3 and 7thday (p 0.005, 0.006, 0.022, 0.032 and admission and 7thday (p 0.013 and at admission and 7thday (p 0.007 and 0.014). After the multivariable analysis obtained the QI at admission as an in- dependent factor with mortality OR 0.978 (95 % CI 0.962 to 0.994; p 0.009). We performed a ROC curve for QI with AUC 0.668 (p 0.003) ana cutoff point 80.50 %.Conclusions: BIB as S-100B and DD (1, 2 and 3rd day) and CRP (first 72 hours) in an early stage were related to worse outcome at ICU dis- charge. QI at admission with cutoff point 80.50 % was associatedwith lower risk of mortality. Reference 1.

Copeptin is a novel neuroendocrine peptide that is a strong and independentprognostic marker for functional outcome and death in patients withacute stroke 3. Objectives: To validate the usage of a single Copeptin value on admission as a short-term prognostic marker in patients withacute stroke. Methods: Forty patients admitted to the Critical Care Department with acute ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke according to the AHA/ASA criteria 2were included in the study during the period from Sep- tember 2013 to September 2014 together with ten volunteers who served as controls. Plasma Copeptin level was measured within72 hours from onset of symptoms by ELISA technique. Copeptin levelwas correlated with APACHE II score, GCS, Hemphill score, ASPECTS score and Modifiesd Rankin scale. Results: Copeptin level was statistically higher in studied group than in controls (140.98 \u00b1 101.7 vs. 8.29 \u00b1 2.1 with a p-value <0.001). There was a statistically significant difference of Copeptin level between patients with recurrent stroke and those with no previous history of strokes (168.2 \u00b1 21.83 vs. 84.53 \u00b1 20.33; with higher inhemorrhagic in ischemic stroke (131.6 \u00b1 50.7) didn't reach any statistical significant difference (p-value 0.73). Copeptin level value of 0.007). It was found that Copeptin level possess a positive linear correlation with APACHE II score, Hemphill score and Modified Rankin scale with a p-value of 0.011, 0.000 and <0.001 respectively while it was negatively correlated with AS-PECTS score and GCS with a p-value 0.001 and 0.005 respectively. Copeptin level higher 30.8 Theoptimal value for copeptin as a prognostic marker was54.5 pmol/l with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 97 %. Conclusions: Copeptin could be a novel biomarker that correlates with poor outcome, dependence, disability and death in patients with cerebrovascular stroke.Table 71 (abstract A713).

This study aimed to investigate the association of blood biomarkers with stroke scales and their predictive value afteracute stroke at the time of admission until hospital discharge. Design and methods: We investigated 60 patients with acute stroke who were admitted within 24 h of event onset at the intensive care unit or neurovascular emergency unit of Cl\u00ednicas Hospital. All patients pro-vided venous blood samples for the of (BDNF) within 24 h of the acute event, on the third day and on the fifth day after the stroke.Neurological stroke severity and global disability were determined withthe National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) at the same three times of blood collection and at the time of hospital discharge.Results: The serum levels of the S100\u00df protein, IL-6 and CRP seem to constitute the best panel of biomarkers after acute stroke in this study. When patients were subdivided into two groups according to the NIHSS (NIHSS 6 and NIHSS > 6) and mRS (mRS 3 and mRS > 3) scores, which were used as neurological outcome measures, bothneurologic scores for good outcome (NIHSS 6 and mRS 3) at hos- pital discharge were significantly related to the S100\u00df protein and IL- 6 levels at all of the measured time points. Among the analyzedblood markers, S100\u00df, IL-6 and PCR levels significanttly scales and prognostic value. Conclusion: Blood biomarkers may be useful in acute stroke either by suggesting stroke severity or providing a prognostic value. The additionof the S100\u00df protein, IL-6 and CRP to previously validated stroke scalesslightly improves the ability of these scales to predict outcome. References 1. Jickling GC, Sharp FR.

Objectives: To study the Clinical features and outcomes of patients with PRES admitted to our ICU. Methods: This was a prospective observational study done over period of two years (2014 -15). We included all adult patients admit- ted to our ICU with the following criteria (1) acute onset neurologicsymptoms including headache, encephalopathy, seizure, visual dis-turbance, or focal deficit; (2) focal vasogenic edema on brain imaging and (3) clinical proof of reversibility. Data was collected on demog- raphy, co-existing illness, and admission severity of illness, neuro-logical symptoms, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, treatmentsinitiated and MRI findings. Outcome data collected included, mortal- ity, ICU ALOS, no of ventilator days and neurological disability assessed by modified Rankin scale (MRS). Results: 14 patients were admitted with PRES. 13 patients were fe- males, their mean age was 31.5( \u00b18.3) years. Etiology PRES kidney 1[7.1 %]) and hypertension (n = 1[7.1 %]). Most common presenting symptom was seizure (92.8 %), followed by visual disturbance (42.8 %), headache (42.8 %), encephal-opathy (14.2 %) and status epilepticus (14.2 %).Mean APACHE II & SOFA scores were 8.5(\u00b16.9)&2(\u00b11.7) respectively and GCS on admission was 12.3(\u00b12.9). High blood pressure was seen in 12 patients (85.7 %), their mean systolic and diastolic pressureswere 173(\u00b19.1) /110(\u00b15.5) mmhg respectively. MRI showed parieto-occipital region was most commonly involved (92.8 %), followed by frontal lobe (42.8 %). Blood pressure was controlled with IV antihypertensive agents andmagnesium sulphate was given for eclamptic patients. Time taken forcontrol of blood pressure 31.25(\u00b112) hours and time taken for awaken- ing was 1(median) hour (range1-60). 7(50 %) patients required ventila- tor support of which 3 patients were postoperative caesarean sectionfor eclampsia and 4 patients had neurological deterioration and3(21.4 %) patients required hemodialysis. ICU ALOS was 4.35(\u00b12.4) days and mean ventilator days was 1.7 \u00b1 (2.0) days. One patient [1/14(7.4 %)] died of multiorgan failure and 13 patients were discharged with no re-sidual neurological deficit (Modified Rankin Scale-0).

Lozano - Erasme Hospital, Intensive Care, Brussels, Belgium Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A718 Introduction: In patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI), monitor- ing of brain metabolism using micro dialysis revealed that a de- crease in brain glucose concentrations and an increase in lactate levels were markers of cellular alterations. However, such cathe- ters are not used routinely. Few data are available on glucose and lactate concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these patients. Objectives: Determine the relationship between glucose and lactate concentrations in CSF and arterial blood and the CSF glucose/lactate ratio and its correlation with outcome in severe TBI. Methods: We reviewed data from all patients admitted to a 35- bed medico-surgical ICU following TBI over a 4-year period Fig. 98 (abstract A717).

Inclusion criteria were: a) age >18 years; b) presence of an external ventricular drain (EVD) for intracranial pressure monitoring; c) daily analysis of CSF including glucose concentra-tions for at least 4 consecutive days; d) concomitant measure-ments of blood glucose/lactate concentrations. Demographics and clinical characteristics were recorded on admission as was the need for continuous insulin therapy (IT; target glucose levels:110 -150 mg/dL) and 3-month neurological outcome (unfavour- able outcome was defined as an extended Glasgow Outcome Scale of 1 -4). Results: Of 151 patients TBI patients who needed an EVD, 56 met the inclusion criteria (median age: 37 [26 -59] years; male: 40). Most EVDs were placed on the day of ICU admission and they were maintained for 10 [6 -14] days. Median Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on admission was 7 [3 -10] and most initial CT-scans were classified as V or VI in the Marshall score (54/57). Twenty (36 %)patients died during the ICU stay and 23 (41 %) had a favourable neurological outcome. Patients who received IT (n = 47) on the first day of EVD monitoring had similar blood and CSF glucoseconcentrations than those who did not (n = 9). CSF and bloodglucose levels were similar in survivors and non-survivors, but non-survivors had higher CSF lactate levels (4.2 [2.9-6.0] vs. 2.4 [2.0-3.7] mmol/L; p = and blood lactate levels (1.8 [1.1-2.8]vs. 1.1 [0.8-1.5] mmol/L; p = 0.03) on the first CSF analysis. TheCSF glucose/lactate ratio was lower in the non-survivors than in the survivors (1.0 [0.8-1.7] vs. 1.9 [1.4-2.4]; p =0.008). Similar re- sults were found when patients with an unfavourable neuro-logical outcome were compared with the other patients.Conclusions: Non-surviving patients after TBI have initially higher CSF lactate levels and a lower CSF glucose/lactate ratio than survi- vors. These observations suggest a more profound metabolic braindistress in the non-survivors, who may benefit from an alternativeenergetic substrate to glucose.

Cattlin2, London, UK; 2Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Critical Care, London, UK Correspondence: C. Gallaher - Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Anaesthesia, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 1): A719 Introduction: To prevent delayed cerebal ischaemia spontaneous SAH (s-SAH) are frequently given supra-normalblood pressure targets.1If patients with DCI do not improve with hypertensive therapy (achieved using fluids and vasopressor drugs, e.g. noradrenaline), a trial of inotropic therapy (e.g. dobu-tamine) may be considered.2Consequently, vasopressor and/or inotropic therapy is frequently required in s-SAH patients. Central venous catheters (CVCs) are required for the safe administration of many vasopressors and inotropes,3,4but carry potentially ser- ious morbidity and mortality risks,5,6particularly as the femoral insertion site is frequently chosen to avoid the theoretical risk of impaired venous drainage from the head in association with in- ternal jugular vein CVC placement.7The authors observed that there was a difference in practice between consultants within theDepartment of Anaesthesia regarding the routine placement of CVCs in patients with s-SAH, prompting the study.Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investgate what propor- tion of patients admitted to ICU with s-SAH required vasopressor and/or inotropic support, what proportion required CVCs, and to es-tablish guidelines as to which s-SAH patients should have CVCsinserted routinely. Methods: All consecutive patients admitted to Charing Cross Hospital ICU with s-SAH for a 1-year period were included retrospectively (n = 70).Results: Forty patients (57.1 %) had vasopressors and/or inotropes administered. Duration of therapy was >24 hours in 38/40 (95 %); median duration was 5.5 days (IQR 6.25 [range 1 -22]). Of 44 patients admitted to ICU with GCS 13 ( NB World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) grade 3 SAH = GCS 13 -14, with motor deficit), 17 (38.6 %) had vasopressors/inotropes administered, and 10 (22.7 %) had a CVC inserted. Of 26 patients admitted to ICU with GCS 12 (NB WFNS grade 4 SAH = GCS 7 -12, with or without motor deficit), 23 (88.5 %) had vasopressors/inotropes administered, and 23(88.5 %) had a CVC inserted. Conclusions: Central venous catheterization carries significant morbidity and mortality risks, and cannot be recommended rou-tinely in all patients admitted to ICU with s-SAH. However,pateints with WFNS grade 4 or 5 SAH (equivalent to GCS 12) al- most invariably (in 88.5 % of cases) require vasopressors/ino- tropes and central venous catheterization. CVC insertion should,therefore, of the routine anaesthetic care of patientswith s-SAH who have GCS 12. References Suarez Management of TP, Hemphill III JC, et al.

Fontana, O. Bond, L. University Correspondence: - Erasme University Hospital, Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles, Intensive Care, Brussels, Belgium Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A720 Introduction: Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of erythrocytes and it is usedfor the differential diagnosi s of anaemia. High RDW has been associated with increased hospital mortality in some patients, but this has not been studied i n subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH).Objectives: To investigate whether RDW is associated with outcome after SAH. Methods: We reviewed our institutional database of all adult pa- tients with non-traumatic SAH (2013 -2015). We collected demo- graphics, SAH-related data and results of routine daily blood analyses. The RDW (normal values: 10.9-13.4 %), was obtained from the day of admission to day 3. We recorded ICU mortalityand long-term neurological outcome; a Glasgow Outcome scaleof 4 -5 at 3-months was used to define a good neurological out- come (GNO).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 368 of 607Results: A total of 174 patients (age 55 [45 -66] years; male 76/ 174) were studied with a median Glasgow Coma Score of 14 [5 - 15] and a Fisher scale of 4 [3 -4]. Sixty-three patients (36 %) de- veloped delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI); overall ICU mortality was 56/174 (32 %) and GNO and 101 patients (58 %) had a GNO. The median RDW on admission was 13.9 [13.3-14.7]% and the highest value during the study period was 14.3 [13.6-15.1]%. A total of 115 patients (66 %) had a high RDW on admission. The RDW was significantly higher on admission in patients who devel- oped DCI than in the other patients (14.0 [14.5-14.9]% vs. 13.6 [13.1-14.3]%, p < 0.001), in non-survivors than in survivors (14.4 [13.9-14.9]% vs. 13.7 [13.1-14.5]%, p < 0.001) and in patients with poor neurological outcome than in those with GNO (14.5 [13.9- 14.9]% vs. 13.6 [13.1-14.2]%, p < 0.001). Conclusions: RDW is higher in patients with a poor outcome after SAH. It could be used to better stratify the severity of these patients on admission. A721 Are there cerebral biomarkers for secondary brain damages after traumatic brain injury? Experimental study in rat model S. Mrozek1,2, L. Capilla3, de l'agression traumatique Experimental 2016, 1): A721 Introduction: Secondary insults such as hypoxia-hypotension (HH) provide secondary brain damages and worsen neurologic outcome in patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Early identification of secondary insults with biomarkers could improve the characterization of TBI severity to better individualize treatment. Several biomarkers have been investigated in severe TBI; However, they have been poorly studied after secondary brain insults. Two of them appear to be particularly of interest1:Glial fibrillary acidic (UCH-L1). Objective: Our objective was to describe the effects of a stan- dardized secondary insult including hypoxia and hypotension on GFAP and UCH-L1 expression in rat brain in a model of severe diffuse TBI. Methods: Rats were randomly allocated to the following 4 groups: Control (C) , in which the entire procedure was performed except TBI and HH; TBI, in which TBI was performed phase alone; TBI HH , in which TBI was followed by HH. The TBI model was realized according to the adapted model of Marmarou and Foda reproducing diffuse TBI with acceleration- deceleration damage. was performed by mechanical ventila- tion with O 2/N2mixture of 10 %/90 % (decrease in arterial PaO 2to about 40 mmHg). Hypotension was obtained with a controlled hemorrhagic shock (mean arterial pressure (MAP) at 40 mmHg) dur- ing 15 minutes. Brains were collected after 4 hours of mechanical ventilation for immunohistochemistry of GFAP and UCH-L1 in 6 re- gions data were compared using Kruskall- Wallis test (p < 0.05). Results: Twenty-four rats were included (C, n = 9; TBI, n = 9; HH, n = 3 ;T B I + H H ,n = 3 ) .F o rG F A P ,i m m u n o s t a i n i n gr e v e a l e dad e - crease of strong staining (p < 0.001) in the neocortex for TBI + HH group compared to TBI group (Fig. 101). A similar trend was ob- served in the hippocampus without reaching statistical signifi- cance. In all regions, strong staining trended to decrease in TBI group compared to control group. For UCH-L1, strong stainingtended to decrease for TBI + HH group compared to TBI group in the neocortex (NS). Moreover, a trend of strong staining decrease in all regions for TBI group compared to control group. Conclusion: These preliminary results suggest that GFAP and UCH-L1 could be early markers of secondary insults reflecting glial and neuronal damages after severe TBI.

PbtO2 MNT is not that frequent, despite studies supporting its use. Given the link between hypoxia and a bad outcome, we accept that correcting brain hypoxia may improve the final result. Objectives: To identify to what extent survival and level of depend- ence (analysed by GOS at 6 months, GOS-6) of neurocritical patients (NCP) are affected by the time under certain levels of PbtO2, with simultaneous normal ICP value. Methods: Retrospective study. NCP admitted to our ICU (2011 -15) underwent ICP + PbtO2 MNT . Registered GCS, GOS-6. NCP groups gr0 (GOS-6 = & 5; moderately/not dependent). 21 variables (VAR) were analysed, 5 of which reached statistical relevance. We focused on the following items: T1: Time (h) with ICP > 20; T2: with PbtO2 < 5; and combined VAR: T10: Time (h) with ICP < 20 + PbtO2 < 10; T15: Time (h) with ICP < 20 + PbtO2 < 15; T20: Time (h) with ICP < 20 + PbtO2 < 20. STATISTYCAL ANALYSIS. We conducted the study in two phases. FIRST: we compared NCP who survived with those who did not, fo- cusing on critical values of PbtO2 and ICP. SECOND: we variables T10, T15 and T20. After obtaining data descriptive, for each one of them, we applied para- metric statistic tests. The arithmetic mean was the starting point. To compare means we used t Student and Welch robust test. Then we conducted a logistic regression analysis to evaluate to what extent each VAR affects outcome or dependence. For gr2 and 3 we per- formed Kaplan-Meier analysis, to compare the relationship between outcome and the time that each type of patient required to reach a specified goal of PbtO2 (10, 15 and 20). Results: 49 NCP were included (63.3 % men); mean age: 50 (s.d.14,92). The main results of the 1st phase are shown in Table 74. The risk of death vs no death increases 5.8 % with every h with high ICP. The risk of death vs no death increases 24 % with every h with PbtO2 < 5 and normal ICP. The results of T10, T15 and T20 VAR are shown in Table 75. The probability of being highly vs low dependent increases 5.4 % every h with PbtO2 < 15, given normal ICP. For variable T10, differ- ences are nearly but not definitely statistically significant. Finally, for VAR T10 and T15, Kaplan Meier estimator was applied, (results shown in Figs. 102 and 103. Conclusions: Maintained high ICP and low PbtO2 are mortality determi- nants. Time with low PbtO2 increases the risk of death to a higher extent than time with high ICP. Low PbtO2 is in itself an independent prognostic factor. Even with moderate brain hypoxia, patients may reach an accept- able functional outcome. Not only are PbtO2 values crucial for outcome, b u ta l s ot i m es p e n tt oa c h i e v ea na c c e p t a b l ev a l u e . Table 74 (abstract A722).

GuptaAll India Institute of Medical Sciences, Neurosciences Centre, Delhi, India Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A723 Introduction: The study hypothesis was hypoglycaemia is an independ- ent outcome prognosticator in severe traumatic brain injured cases. Objectives: The study aimed to see the role of glucose monitoring in the brain parenchyma region as independent outcome prognosticatorand its association with plasma glucose . The aim of the study was toanalyse the relationship of intracerebral glucose measured by intrapar- enchymal cerebral microdialysis and it's relationship to blood glucose. We also evaluated the relationship of these values to the outcome.Methods: Prospective nonrandomised study conducted at a tertiary care trauma centre in India.Twenty-five patients with severe TBI who underwent decompressive moni- tored with intracerebral microdialysis catheters (MD).Results: Fifteen patients (60 %) had a good outcome in terms of GOS at 3 months while the rest (10 patients) had poor GOS at 3 months. There was significant difference in the incidence of hyperglycemia (RBS > 10 mmol/L) between the two groups (p < 0.0001). The differ-ence between the two groups while comparing episodes ofhypoglycemia was significant (p = 0.0026). Good outcome group had fewer episodes of brain hypoglycemia during systemic hypoglycemia (p = 0.0026). Neither mean blood glucose values nor mean cerebralglucose values predicted outcome at 3 months.Conclusions: After decompressive craniectomy in severe TBI, there was a poor correlation between plasma and MD glucose concentra- tion. A high degree of variation was seen in the correlations for pa-tients individually. Neither mean blood glucose values nor meancerebral glucose values predicted outcome at 3 months. Good out- come group had fewer episodes of both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia. References 1. Vespa PM, McArthur D, O'Phelan K, Glenn T, Etchepare M, Kelly D, et al.

It is used for recruitment to ICM training posts and also forms part of assess-ment for the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine exam, however itsuse in ICM education training lags behind anaesthesia.Objectives: We aimed to establish and evaluate a programme of regular, integrated, curriculum-mapped point-of-care simulation training in a United Kingdom University Hospital Intensive Care Unit.Methods: A 6 month pilot project was undertaken delivering dedi- cated, weekly inter-professional simulation sessions as part of the existing trainee education programme. This consists of weekly, 2- hour curriculum-mapped small group sessions attended by stage 1, 2and 3 ICM trainees. During the pilot programme, 1 hour of each ses-sion was transferred to a simulation-based session, with scenario ob- jectives designed to complement the teaching topic. At least 1 member of nursing staff was released from clinical duties to partici-pate in the session. Other allied professionals were encouraged to at-tend. Each session required 1 confederate, 1 debriefer and 1 person to run the manikin. Scenarios were designed to explore both tech- nical and non-technical aspects of the topic and were delivered in anICU side-room that is permanently set up with a manikin. Debriefingwas provided using the \u00b4good judgement\u00b4 model. Quantitative and qualitative feedback was sought after each session 1. After 6 sessions, interim feedback was analysed and changes were implemented forthe remaining pilot sessions.Results: Several common themes emerged from the initial feedback. Whilst broadly positive, participants and faculty all stated that the room was very crowded, with many feeling that it detracted fromthe learning experience. In an attempt to address this, we employedthe low-cost iOS application Airbeam\u00ae. This allows live audio and video to be streamed over a secure wireless network between iOS devices (iPhones and a MacBook). This allowed observers to view thescenario from an adjacent room.Final feedback was almost universally positive. Participants reported greater willingness to speak up in future and highlighted specific is- sues such as the accessibility of emergency guidelines. Quantitativefeedback demonstrated statistically significantly higher scores in allareas for simulation versus didactic teaching. Conclusions: We were able to provide a curriculum-mapped, in situ simulation-based training programme within our ICU that was highlyrated by participants using low-cost, medium fidelity technology. Wepresent our experiences as potential template for other programmes. References 1. Rudolph, J W, et al., et al.

Results: We received 115 responses. The vast majority were LTFT due to childcare responsibilities (96.4 %). 7.2 % had been asked tocomplete their ICM training full time despite approval for LTFT train- ing from their parent specialty. 40 % had considered dual training with ICM but ultimately decided against it. Only 3.5 % were planningto apply in the future. 78.3 % had encountered difficulties with ICMtraining related to their LTFT status. The most common issues were engaging in extra-curricular activities, negative attitudes to LTFT training and working patterns. 45.2 % felt they were perceived morenegatively than their FT peers. 53.1 % felt they would consider apply-ing for dual training if there was a more structured pathway for LTFT trainees. LTFT trainees expressed a wish to connect with others in order to allow peer support and mentorship.Conclusions: Very low numbers of LTFT anaesthetic trainees are pur- suing a career within ICM due to difficulties encountered with their training. Some of the highlighted issues may be due to the nature of ICM but the negative attitudes experienced by LTFTs can and shouldbe addressed and more structured guidance for navigating LTFTtraining within ICM could be developed. Innovative approaches to allow equity of access to training opportunities would be welcomed. We propose that although ICM and LTFT training have not been themost natural bedfellows, there is a pressing need for this relationshipto improve. LTFT trainees may be a relatively untapped resource which could contribute towards the necessitated expansion of the ICM workforce. References 1. Rhodes A. FICM Workforce.

Rubulotta - Imperial College London, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A726 Introduction: Oral part of EDIC diploma examinations has changed in 2013 into objective-structured clinical examination (OSCE) type exam [1]. All candidates face identical questions with pre-defined correct answers simultaneously in 7 high-throughput exam centres.Objectives: To identify factors associated with success in part 2 EDIC exam. Methods: We prospectively collected self-reported data from all can- didates sitting EDIC Part 2 in 2015, namely demographics, profes-sional background and attendance to an EDIC part 2 or generic OSCEexam preparatory courses. After testing association with success (with cut-off at p < 0.10) and co-linearity of these factors as inde- pendent variables, we performed a multivariate logistical analysis,with binary exam outcome (pass/fail) as the dependent variable.Structural equation modelling was used to gain further insight into relations among determinants of success in oral part of EDIC. Results: Out of 427 candidates sitting the exam we completed data from 341 (80 %). Following candidates' factors were associated withincreased chance of success: English as native language (Odds ratio 4.3 [95%CI 1.7; 10.7]), use of Patient-Centered Acute care Training e- learning program module (OR 2.0 [1.2; 3.3]) and working in EU coun-try (OR 2.5 [1.5; 4.3]) and better results in written part of EDIC (foreach additional SD of 6.1 points OR 1.9 [1.4; 2.4]). On the contrary, chance of success in EDIC 2 decreased with candidates\u00b4age (for each additional SD of 5.5 years OR 0.67 [0.51; 0.87]). Factors eliminatedfrom the model because of lack of association with success or be-cause of co-linearity included attendance in EDIC Part 2 prep courses (OR 0.95 [0.52-1.70]), English as study language, baseline medical specialty, the use of CoBaTriCE and actual working status (working ornot). Exam centres could be grouped into 3 groups with similar suc-cess rates, and there were significant differences in exam outcomes among these groups even after adjustment to known candidates\u00b4 factors (G1 vs G2 OR OR 3.9 [1.7; 9.2]). Short data collection period (only one year)and 20 % of missing candidates' data are the main limitations of this study. The ESICM examination committee and Executive Committee have taken a series of measures in order to optimise fairness and re-producibility of the exam, which will be meticulously monitored inupcoming series of exams. Conclusions: Younger age, English as native language, working at a European country and the use of PACT for preparation were factorsassociated with success in oral part of EDIC exam. Despite the limita-tions of this study, the signal of differences in outcomes among the 7 exam centres will need further investigation. References 1.

Amarante Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, Intensive Care Unit, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Correspondence: R.R.L. Fumis - Hospital S\u00edrio-Liban\u00eas, Intensive Care Unit, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A727 Introduction: Burnout appears to be common among Critical Care pro- viders. It is characterized by three components: emotional exhaustion orloss of passion for one's work; depersonalization or treating patients as objects and the sense that your work is no longer meaningful. Moral dis- tress is the inability of a moral agent to act according to his or her corevalues and perceived obligations due to internal and external constraints.Objectives: To assess both burnout syndrome and moral distress among all ICU and the Step Down Unit (SDU) providers (Physicians, Nurses, Nurse Technicians, and Respiratory Therapists) and to esti-mate the correlation between moral distress and burnout.Methods: For data collection, a self-administered questionnaire for each critical care provider was used including basic demographic data, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) and the Moral Distress Scale (MDS).Results: A total of 283 of the 389 (72.7 %) Critical Care providers (Nurses, Nurses Technicians and Respiratory Therapists), agreed to par- ticipate and the survey occurred from August and September 2015. Out of this total, 134 were from ICU and 116 from SDU. Regarding Phy-sicians, the same team of intensivists attended both ICU and SDU andthey were treated as an individual group and 67.3 % of them partici- pated. Severe Burnout was identified in 18.2 % of Physicians. Consider- ing all others Critical care providers (ICU + SDU) we identified that22.5 % (95 % CI: 17.7-27.8 %) presented severe Burnout. There was notstatistical difference between the units: 22.1 % of ICU respondents had severe Burnout and 23.7 % from SDU,p = 0.774. A total of 68 question- naires of Moral Distress were incomplete and were excluded from ana-lysis. All respondents (n = 215) reported a high level of moral distressIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 372 of 607overall. The mean MDS rate for all ICU respondents including both do- mains (frequency and intensity) was 111.5 and for all SDU respondents was 104.5, p = 0.446. We observed that those respondents with high MDS score (>100 points) were more likely to suffer from Burnout (28.9 % x 14.4 %, p = 0.010). Moreover, many questions from the MDS questionnaire were significantly associated with severe burnout. Conclusions: Our data show that moral distress, resulting from thera- peutic obstinacy and the provision of futile care was the great prob- lem of the critical care providers' team and significantly associated with severe burnout.

Sanders Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, UK Correspondence: A. Skorko - Bristol Royal Infirmary, Bristol, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A728 As the United Kingdom intensive care training curriculum develops and the role of the intensive care physician becomes more defined so pro- cedural skills associated with this role will become refined. Some skills such as intubation and central access are well recognised. However, oc- casionally less common skills may be required and these deserve a place in the curriculum. One such skill is that of Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (SBT) insertion. Currently the curriculum contains domain 5.18: 'Describes Sengstaken tube (or equivalent) placement'. A trainee survey was undertaken to quantify the degree of familiarity with this clinical tool in the Severn deanery in the South West of the UK. A mixed cohort of 24 trainees responded (17 intensive care, 7 anaesthetic trainees). Of those surveyed 3 had inserted SBT, 21 had not. 61 % had some previous experience with SBT ('seen one inserted by someone' or 'looked after a patient with an SBT in situ'). Little formal teaching existed on the topic with 57 % having received no training. 75 % felt they would benefit from a formal teaching session. This survey demonstrated a gap in confidence and exposure to SBT use. As a result, a short teaching intervention was performed during a regional training day. This focused on the common cause of GI bleeds and situations where SBT may be of benefit, as well as practical aspects of insertion, along a low fidelity model demonstration. After this session a repeat questionnaire was sent out. This demon- strated that confidence was improved (Fig. 104), with 61 % feeling that annual training would be of benefit. Summary: As the Intensive Care curriculum continues to develops, trainees feel they would benefit from regular training sessions in less common skills such as the management of Sengstaken-Blakemore tubes. More broadly, involving trainees in the development of the curriculum will ensure it meets the learning needs of the future work force and guarantee high quality patient care.A729 Creation of a critical care training program for midwives: part of a quality improvement project to create a maternal high dependency environment J. Aron, R.J. Kroll, C. Redfearn, P. Krishnan Medway Maritime Hospital, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Gillingham, UK Correspondence: J. Aron - Medway Maritime Hospital, Anaesthesia and Intensive Care, Gillingham, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A729 Introduction: National guidelines state that critically ill women should receive the same standard of care for their pregnancy- related and critical care needs. With changes to midwife training focusing on normal labour and delivery, nursing competences are reduced. A recent national audit identified that 43 % staff in ma- ternity high dependency unit (HDU) areas had no specific critical care training (1). Objectives: - To identify the need to cerate a HDU on the labour ward to meet these national standards through local audit. - Development of a training course for midwives. Methods: A retrospective audit including all cases admitted to HDU over a one-year period was conducted. Information regarding demographics, diagnosis, maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality and length of critical care stay was collected. Sec ondly, a prospective audit over a 2- week period surveyed all obstetric in-patients including demographics, physiology scoring, level of care required and staff providing this care. Results: The retrospective phase identified 18 patients transferred to HDU, all post-partum. 6 of these patients could have been accommo- dated on a HDU on labour ward, had one existed. The prospective phase identified 17 women required HDU according to physiology scoring. 88 % of these women were cared for by Band 6/7 midwives, and the remainder by band 5 midwives. None of the midwives had recent critical care training. Only 26 % of patients were reviewed by an anaesthetist and 37 % by a consultant obstetrician. 42 % did not re- ceive the correct review prompted by their MMEOWS score. MECU development: A 2-day course was created using a mixed- methods teaching program including theoretical, practical and simula- tion based sessions. The curriculum is designed to improve midwives\u00b4 confidence and skills in detecting, treating and stabilizing emerging or established critical illness. Fig. 104 (abstract A728). Pre versus post intervention confidenceIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 373 of 607The midwives who participated in the MMEC course highlighted that the practical elements, demonstrations and simulation-based teaching facilitated their learning were particularly effective. Feedback identified increased confidence in clinical management, increased awareness of when to escalate and recognition of their own limitations. Conclusions: The MECU course, as part of a larger quality im- provement project to create a labour ward HDU environment was created in response to local audit. This identified that such a unit could reduce admissions to HDU provide appropriate care for in-patients in need of a higher level of care. The course cre- ated has a curriculum designed to increase confidence and awareness of the issues surrounding the sick parturient and has received excellent feedback. Future plans include development of a regional training network. References 1.

Kovari - North Middlesex University Hospital, ICU, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A730 The aim of this audit was to demonstrate any significant improve- ment in our inter-hospital transfer practice following the introduction of a new simulated all day training provided to junior doctors in the view of auditing our transfer data from 2014 -2015. A single centre retrospective audit in 21 bed mixed ICU of a non- tertiary university hospital. During the audit period (2014 -15) 29 crit- ical care transfers were made. We audited data of referring team, lo- cation, receiving team, transfer reason, decision-departure time, intubation details, arterial blood gases (ABG), comments of the teams, time of transfer, documentation and transferring doctor grade. Our primary aim was to analyse any effect of our newly intro- duced complex transfer training program. In 2014, transfers were by SHO level doctors 38.5 % of cases, staff grade and registrar level doctors were 46.1 % each, 15.3 % were not documented . In 2015, transfers were by SHO level doctors 6.25 % of cases, staff grade and registrar level doctors were 93.7 % each. All transfers were documented. Non-clinical reasons in 2014 were 24 % opposite zero non clinical transfers in 2015. In 2014 (53.8 %) of transfers occurred outside nor- mal working hours (8 am to 17:00) versus 56.25 % in 2015, unlike the past where most of transfers usually happened outside the normal working hours. Transfer- decision to departure time varied, with an average time of minutes In 2014 the average time in minutes was 229 minutes which was nearly double its peer value in 2015 (133 minutes). Records of the doctor performing the transfer were well kept but those of the receiving team were generally absent but thanks to the new transfer form 24 out of 29 comments from the receiving team were documented (82.7 %) and were consistent with the expecta- tions with one comment saying (Excellent handover). The transfer of the critically ill patients remains a big challenge to ju- niors of all grades. A complex and holistic approach needed with a broad spectrum of knowledge regarding the possible complications. Our all day transfer course introduced in 2015 gave the opportunity to learn and hands on simulate with a live ambulance what is it like to be on a hot transfer.Our data shows significant improvement in the documentation, organization and quality of transfer without adverse events affecting patient\u00b4s safety with lack of incident reports. The positive feed backs from trainees and the overall improvement of our transfer service proves that simulated training of this difficult and grey area is fruitful and worth carry on. References 1.

Kongpolprom 1King Chulalongkorn Memmorial Hospital, Thai Red Cross and Chulalonkorn University, Critical Care and Pulmonary Medicine, Bangkok, Thailand Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A731 Introduction: Delirium is one of the most common complications resulting in ICU morbidity and mortality. Despite its well-known con- dition, delirium is frequently unrecognized by critical care teams. Additionally, assessment of delirium in critically ill patients is not rou- tinely performed in our country. The Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU)1,2is a well-validated tool for delirium evalu- ation, however, it is the new tool for our team. Objectives: We aimed to assess nurse competence in using the CAM-ICU for delirium evaluation. Methods: Our hospital had implemented the CAM-ICU for delirium evaluation in 2 medical ICUs for a 4-month period and we subse- quently assessed nurse competence in using the CAM-ICU by a paper-based examination. All medical ICU nurses were enrolled to perform the test which was composed of 5 case-scenarios. The nurses were allowed to use CAM-ICU sheets for Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) scoring3and Results: ICU nurses did the paper-based test. Ap- proximately, 31 % of the examinees scored RASS inaccurately. Inter- estingly, 60 % of them did not understand how to interpret the mental status domain of the CAM-ICU, especially the fluctuating course of consciousness. In addition, only 29 % of them detected hypoactive delirium correctly. Furthermore, 80 % of the examinees got confused to make a diagnosis of delirium in partially sedated patients. Conclusions: The study demonstrated the limited skill and know- ledge of our intensive care nurses in detecting delirium by the CAM-ICU. According to these results, a structural training program would be provided to increase the nurse competence in delirium assessment.References 1.

A732 A systematic review of the impact of simulation in human factors and non-technical skills (NTS) on the safety and quality in intensive care training, based on the lessons learnt from aviation and other high-risk industries V. Gulia Good Hope Hospital, Anaesthesia + Intensive care, Sutton Coldfield, United Kingdom Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A732 Introduction: In 2007, Martin Bromiley established the first clinical human factors group, which has both clinical and NTS specialists in- volved in safety in intensive care and anaesthesia. Human factors and NTS contribute up to 40 % of the critical inci- dents as per the NAP 4 anaesthesia audit which was a UK based na- tional level audit on the adverse incidents in airway management during anaesthesia. The causes for critical incidents included lack of situation awareness, judgement and poor decision making with poor communication and teamwork. A mortality rate of 5.6 per million general anaesthetics (1:180 000) in a period of over a year in anaes- thesia, ICU and the emergency department, was reported. The pro- ject findings suggest avoidable deaths due to airway complications occur in ICU and the emergency department. Objectives: To analyse the rationale of a full-scale simulator called the Comprehensive Anesthesia Simulation Environment (CASE )to specifically study decision-making processes of anaesthetists during that were a take off from aviation Crew Resource Management (CRM )in difficult Airway & Resuscitation situation. Critical analysis of simulation as a valid and reliable tool to assess the competency based training (CBT). Methods: This study conducts a systematic literature search and an analytical review from the Cochrane database of reviews and other online sites such as Medline, Embase and Pubmed. Results-Simulator enables faculty to provide structured simulation lab experiences instead of trying to find appropriate and/or rare patient care opportunities in a health care settingAny kind of environment can be created to train multi professional teams in primary and sec- ondary care. Currently simulators are used much more for educa- tional purposes (undergraduate: 77 %, postgraduate: 85 %) than for evaluation purposes (undergraduate: 14 %, postgraduate: 7 % (Girard, Ely 2008) and that proportion needs to change with the current needs of using simulation for evaluation of competency. Conclusions: Human factor training develops leadership, coordination and shared understanding of roles leading to improved performance in anaesthesia, trauma and intensive care. Simulation is vital to validate CBT and it can be accepted as a comprehensive way to assess proced- ural skill. Behaviour and personality testing should be considered in the selection process to identify the prospective trainees in the subject along with the just use of NTS training to achieve that end. Simulation centres require important financial and human resources and hence the need for communication and collaboration among centres using simulation technology to improve quality of training.

Duro1, Faro, Emergency and Intensive Care Department, Faro, Portugal;2Biomedical Sciences and Medical Department, Algarve Centro Hospitalar do Hospital de Faro, Emergency and Intensive Care Department, Faro, Portugal Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A733 Introduction: The professional activity in the ICU departments has in- herent a particularly high level of stress, which is a risk factor for de-velopment of burnout.Studies carried out in this area have revealed high levels of burnout and how these were related with labor absents with its conse- quences for the functioning of units.Objectives: To identify the possible existence of burnout and its risk and protective factors in health professionals of the ICU Department of Algarve Hospital Center - Faro. Methods: Quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive study in which we applied a self-fulfilled questionnaire containing three items: sociode-mographic characterization of the study population, experiences lived in the workplace based on Embriaco questionnaire and Maslash Burnout Inventory (MBI).Results: Out of 77 professionals, 75 agreed to answer to the question- naire (response rate 97.4 %). 60 returned the complete questionnaire, 8 physicians and 52 nurses. 43.3 % o f the professionals had less than 10 years of work experience and 29.3 % said that if they could theywould change profession. We consider ed burn out if the professional pre- sented high level on Emotional Exhaustion and Depersonalization and low level of Personal Accomplishment; high risk of developing burnout if high level was presented in Emotional Exhaustion or Depersonalizationand low level in Personal Accomplishment; and moderate risk if Emo-tional Exhaustion or Depersonalization presented high level or Personal Accomplishment presented low level. Of the 60 professionals, 48.3 % presented moderate or high risk of developing burnout or were inburnout. Burn out levels were higher in women (26.7 %) versus men(13.3 %) and in physicians (25 %) versus nurses (23.1 %). Conclusions: Burn out or high risk of developing burnout was pre- sented in a high rate of health professionals of our unit. Beingwoman and physician is associated with a higher risk of developingburnout. Strategies aiming to reduce burnout should include coping strategies and specific training in this field.

A734 Stress and anxiety in relatives of patients on ICU J. Hayward, F. Baldwin, R. GrayBrighton and Sussex University Trust, ICU, Brighton, UKCorrespondence: J. Hayward - Brighton and Sussex University Trust, ICU, Brighton, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A734 Introduction: It is known that significant anxiety and depression is suffered by relatives during a patients ICU admission with up to 33 % going on to experience post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)1, 2. A better understanding of these symptoms and risk factors fordeveloping them may help determine interventions to avoid these adverse psychological states. Objectives: The aim of the study was twofold. The first aim was to quantify the number of relatives with clinically detectable anxietyand depression using a verified scoring system. The second aim was to see how access to information correlated with anxiety and depres- sion scores.Methods: A questionnaire of patients' relatives on the ICU over a six month period (February - August 2015) was carried out. Local ethical approval was granted. Relatives were selected at random to be part of the study and elective admissions and ad-missions of less than 48 hrs were excluded from the study. Thequestionnaire collated data on t he 'hospital anxiety and depres- score' (HADS), the perceived quality of communication de- livered and the external sup port outside the ICU that was sought.Results: The questionnaire was completed by 50 relatives. Clinically significant anxiety was found in 38 (76 %) relatives and 20 (40 %) had clinically significant depression. There was no correlation be-tween length of stay and HADS. There was a correlation betweenhigh HADS and perceived high quality of communication on the ICU. This possibly indicates that these relatives sought or required more information to help allay anxieties.External information sources relating to the ICU and patients medicalconditions was actively sought in 20 (40 %) of relatives, with the internet and friends being the most popular sources. Many individ- uals said they felt isolated when they were at home and relied onfriends for support.Conclusions: The results demonstrate that a large proportion of our patients relatives suffer significant acute psychological symp- toms. Relatives with higher HADS sought more information fromICU staff and 40 % of relatives also sought external support andinformation. Following the results of this we have developed a website specific for our ICU with general information, useful links and a contact email address for the ICU consultants. We plan tore audit relatives HADS 6 months after the introduction of thewebsite. References 1. Azoulay E et al.

A735 The effect of structural simulation based team training in the ICUP.A. Katinakis1, M. Stijf1, M. Netherlands;2VU University Medical Center, of Public and Occupational Health, Amsterdam, NetherlandsCorrespondence: P.A. Katinakis - Gelre Hospitals, Apeldoorn, Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A735 Introduction: The most common sources of clinical errors are not from failure of clinical knowledge or skill, but rather failure of team performance with deficiencies in communication, coordination andteamwork. Growing evidence suggests that team training based oncrew resource management (CRM) principles may improve team- work, patient safety, and optimization of patient care. Objectives: We evaluated the impact of simulation based team train- ing on acute ICU admissions and determined this improved the con-fidence of the ICU staff and the quality of teamwork. Methods: The project comprised 2 parts. In the first part, all partici- pants received a 2-hour theoretical video training covering the basicsof CRM prior the beginning of the study. Subsequently, during aIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 376 of 607period of 3 months, the admitting physician and coordinating nurse were asked to fill in a survey covering the 4 domains of teamwork (Leadership, communication, stress and situational awareness) on allacute admissions in the ICU. Items were scored on a scale of 0 (notimportant or worst level) to 10 (very important or highest level). The second part of the study consisted of structural trainings of all physician- and nursing staff in the ICU divided in groups of 3 nursesand 1 physician, using high fidelity MTW/CRM based simulation witha prefixed scenario. The groups had each to fill in surveys before and after training, and were debriefed by an experienced instructor using video analysis. Scenario trainings were scheduled to be repeatedafter 6 months.Results: During 133 acute ICU admissions physicians and nurses had the perception that handing over information and communication was above average, however summaries were used poorly (medianscores 4 and 6 for physicians and nurses).After 2 structural trainings, physician and nurses felt they were more competent leaders (P = 0.001). Especially nurses became more confident in a leadership role (P = 0.001). Feedback loops, briefingsand summaries were used more systematically (p = < 0.001) andeveryone was more accustomed to standard terminology. Further- more, nurses dared to speak up more (P < 0.001). Overall, stress levels were reduced (P = 0.015).Conclusions: The entire team in the ICU has the perception that structural training in CRM improves confidence and performance. Fu- ture research is warranted to compare these results with behavioural observations of the entire team in the ICU.Grant acknowledgementThis study was partially funded by Gelre Hospitals. A736 Evaluation of intensive care doctors' activity outside of the ICU inan urban general hospitalK. Sinha, M. Luney, K. Palmer, L. Keating Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, UK Correspondence: K. Sinha - Royal Berkshire Hospital, Reading, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A736 Introduction: The number of intensive care unit (ICU) beds in the UK per capita is proportionally one of the lowest in Europe1; the Royal Berkshire Hospital (RBH) has one of the lowest proportions comparedto the rest of UK. Access to this resource is therefore limited and in- creasingly intensivists are being asked to bring intensive care to the wards2. Objectives: To describe the work carried out by intensive care doc- tors outside the 17 bed ICU in the 745 bed Royal Berkshire Hospital serving a population of 600,000 people and identify any impact this has on patient outcome.Methods: Contemporaneously recorded requests for intensivists to review patients on inpatient wards and in the emergency depart- ment during 1stAugust 2014 - 31stJuly 2015 were retrieved from the electronic ICU database. Hospital admission and discharge data wereanalysed for comparison of outcomes.Results: 1108 patients were referred; paediatric patients (n = 108) and referrals with incomplete details (n = 105) were excluded from analysis. 895 patients were included in analysis, median age 66 years(interquartile range = 48-77 years). 26.6 % were admitted to ICU (n =238), of which 76.1 % survived to discharge from RBH. 45.6 % re- ferred patients were suitable for but not requiring an ICU admission at the time of referral (96.1 % survived), 17.6 % were at their ceilingof care (ward based care maximum; 19 % survived). 60.7 % of all re-ferred patients not admitted to ICU survived to hospital discharge. Conclusions: Intensivists spend considerable clinical time reviewing patients on general wards, however only a proportion (26.6 %) re-quire admission to an intensive care unit. The outcome for patientsin whom escalation in care was felt inappropriate was widely poor. Whereas those reviewed by intensivists and considered eligible for but not requiring of admission to ICU experienced good outcomes(survival rate 96.1 %). Any potential effect of an increased bed cap-acity on admission and survival is unknown.References 1. Rhodes et al. The variability of critical bed numbers in Europe.

Abu-Habsa - Kent, Surrey and Sussex Air Ambulance, Surrey, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A737 Introduction: Since the advent of Focussed Assessment with Sonog- raphy for Trauma (FAST), focussed sonography has become integral to clinical assessment in the early phase of critical illness with wide adoption in Emergency Departments and Critical Care.Bedside ultrasound (US) guided assessment has been demonstratedto be superior to clinical assessment alone in examination of the chest, abdomen, renal and musculoskeletal systems as well as a fun- damental patient safety tool for invasive procedures [1].While focussed US can be considered an extension of basic clinicalskills, most undergraduate programs globally are yet to address this deficit with some uptake in Europe and the United States and none in the UK at present.This descriptive paper outlines our institutional experience integrat-ing focussed ultrasound training into a 3-month Resuscitation Medi- cine module. Objective: Explore feasibility, engagement, self perceived and object- ively assessed competence following integration of US into under-graduate clinical education. Methods: An elective program on Resuscitation medicine was de- signed covering undergraduate learning outcomes spanning earlyidentification of critical illness to the concepts of organ support. Na-tionally adopted ultrasound competencies designed for senior trainees in Emergency Medicine and Critical Care were edited and aligned to each component of the undergraduate module.Students received an average of 2 hours of formal US training weeklyfor an 8 week period and were each allocated a handheld device (GE VScan) and this was integrated into their routine clinical assessment. The following themes were prioritised: /C15Enhanced Focussed Assessment with Sonography for Each candidate recorded an average of 35 satisfactory stud- ies. Undergraduate candidates within this pilot were able to achieve an OSCE assessed competence level comparable to that of postgraduate trainees approaching Royal Colleges\u00b4 defined Level-1 as-sessment. A high degree of satisfaction was observed in formal feed- back. Follow up for skill retention remains ongoing and will be assessed again at 6 months and 12 months in OSCE format. No ad-verse impact observed on acquisition of set learning outcomes.Conclusions: Integration of US training into undergraduate clinical education proved feasible with a high degree of satisfaction and measured competence. While wider integration would carry cost im-plications, this is an area that warrants careful review if the modernundergraduate curriculums are to remain fit for 21st century practice.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 377 of 607References 1.

Lewis - Barts and the London School of Anaesthesia, The Royal London, Intensive Care Medicine, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A738 Introduction: Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is associated with a significant clinical and financial burden on intensive care units (ICU). Length of stay (LOS), duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and mortality are all increased1. National Healthcare Safety Network's (NHSN) data shows VAP rates in trauma patients are up to 3 foldhigher compared to the general ICU population. Centralisation of UK trauma services has created larger cohorts of trauma patients in ded- icated tertiary units1. Objective: We aimed to identify risk factors within the trauma popu- lation that put certain subgroups at higher risk of developing VAP. Method: A retrospective review of all patients admitted to the ter- tiary adult ICU of the Major Trauma Centre (MTC) at The RoyalLondon Hospital over a 1-year period (February 2014 -2015). The diagnosis of VAP was based on the Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS). Demographic, clinical and microbiological data were collected. Mortality, LOS and duration of MV differences were studiedbetween VAP and non-VAP groups.Results: Of the 1269 patients admitted to ICU, 925 required invasive ventilation for > 48 hours. Overall incidence of VAP was 11 % (104/ 925), with rates higher amongst the trauma population 19 % (61/315) compared to the general ICU population 7 % (43/610); p <0.0001. Patients who developed VAP had increased length of ICU stay (19.5+/ 13.6 vs. 9.71 +/ 11.9 days; p < 0.0001) and duration of MV (15.2 +/ 11.3 vs. 6.9 +/ 9.5 days; p < 0.0001). There was no dif- ference in APACHE II scores and mortality between VAP and non-VAPgroups (p = 0.27 and p = 0.16 respectively). Predominant were H.Influenza, S.Aureus, enterobacter and klebsiella. Trauma pa- tients had increased infection with H.Influenza (28 % vs. 12 %) andS.Aureus (36 % vs. 19 %). Trauma patients who developed VAP hadhigher mean injury severity scores (ISS) (34 vs. 27; p = 0.0004) and lower mean pre hospital Glasgow Coma Scores (GCS) (7 vs. 9; p = 0.03) compared to trauma patients without VAP. Trauma patientswith VAP had a higher incidence of significant head injury com-pared to those trauma patients who did not get VAP (41/61 (67 %) vs. 134/254 (52 %); p = 0.04). Chest trauma rates were similar between patients who developed VAP and those who didn o t( 1 8%v .1 4% ;p = 0 . 4 3 ) .Conclusion: The trauma population are at high risk for developing VAP. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients are the highest risk in this group. The ISS is a better predictor for developing VAP than trad-itional ICU scoring systems (APACHE II). Amongst the TBI population,ones with lower pre-hospital GCS are at higher risk, and this may re- flect loss of protective airway reflexes and higher risk of aspiration. VAP is associated with longer LOS and MV, but crude mortality is un-affected. Further research should ascertain other risk factors for VAPwith focussed preventative strategies for high-risk subgroups. References 1. MajorJ et al.Nosocomial Infection in Trauma ICU.

Baptista 1, (CHUC), Intensive Care Medicine, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A739 Introduction: Augmented renal clearance (ARC) has emerged re- cently as a new concept and is being increasingly described in critic- ally care setting. The true prevalence of ARC in these heterogeneouspopulations of critical ill patients is not well known; nevertheless, itmust not be neglected: recent reports describe prevalence between 28 to 65 % within the critically ill population, varying accordingly to methodology and case-mix . Objectives: We aimed to determine the prevalence of ARC and to identify the risk factors (RF) associated with ARC condition, in a large heterogeneous population of critically ill patients. Methods: This was an observational retrospective single-center study, performed in a 20-bed tertiary level, university affiliated, adult inten-sive care unit (ICU), within the period of one year. Daily routine 8 h- creatinine clearance (8-CLC R) was measured to all admitted patients (23 pm to 07 am), excluding measurements where serum creatinine1.2 mg/dL. ARC was defined as m2. De- scriptive demographic and epidemiological characterization of the studied population was performed. Statistical tests used in the ana- lysis were all two-sided, and a p-value of < 0.05 was considered statis-tically significant. A multivariable binary logistic regression modeladjusted for possible confounders (age, gender and cause of ICU ad- mission) was carried out to define RF for ARC condition. Results: For-hundred and seventy-seven patients Revaluations (clearance-days). \"Med- ical \"was the %), followed by \"post-surgery \"(31.9 %) and \"trauma \"(24.7 %). The average SAPS II was 42.3 (12.6). Male gender predominated (65 %) and 98 % of thepatients were submitted to invasive mechanical ventilation. Overall,33 % of the measurements showed ARC (n = 1409), 47 % showed values between 60 and 130 mL/min/1.73 m 2(n = 2006) and 20 % had values lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2(n = 856). The average 8 h volume of urine was higher in patients showing ARC - 875versus 780 mL; p < 0.001. Serum creatinine 17/23 mg/dL, respect- ively; p < 0.01). Adjusted Odds Ratio for ARC was 2.9 (95 % IC:2.4-3.4; p < 0.01) for gender, 1.7 (95 % IC: 1.4-1.9; p < 0.01) fortrauma admission and 1.067 (95 % IC: 1.061-1.073; p < 0.01) for age (per year). Conclusions: ARC was a frequent condition in this large population of critically ill patients with normal plasma creatinine concentrations,with an overall prevalence of 33 % of the days. Decreased renal func- tion (lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m 2) was present in 20 % of the days. Male gender, trauma ICU admission and young age were sig-nificant risk factors for ARC.

Pa- tients who were pregnant, GCS =3 with fixed dilated pupils orhemodynamically unstable were not enrolled in this prospectivenon-randomised study. As part of routine protocol, patient under- went a non contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head at ad- mission along with assessment of other systemic injuries.Informed consent and Institute ethics review board permissionwas obtained prior to inclusion in this study. The outcome was assessed using the Glasgow outcome scale (GOS). Results: A total of 3,697 corresponding cerebral perfusion pres- sure and brain microdialysis readings were obtained. In ourstudy, the mean CPP for the whole cohort was 74.27 mm Hg (SD 14.05). Glycerol: When compared during the first two days of monitoring, the glycerol levels were higher in the unfavourable outcome group(Mean 220.86; SD 25.85) as compared to the favourable outcome group (Mean 191.76; SD 31.89)[NS]. LP ratio: In the poor outcome group, 1354 values were available for LP ratio with a mean of 80.16 (SD 320.26). In the good outcomegroup, 2047 values were obtained with a mean LP ratio of 45.77 (SD 169.82). The difference between the two groups was statistically sig- nificant (p = 0.000).Cerebral perfusion pressure was seen to have an inverse correlation to LP ratio for the whole cohort as would be expected with increased perfusion (p = 0.029). Conclusions: CPP monitoring is important after traumatic brain injury since cerebral blood flow is highly dependent on CPP below thelower limit of cerebral autoregulation (CPP < 50 mmHg). Higher CPP by its effect on metabolic parameters, such as LP ratio could be asso- ciated with a better outcome. References Balestreri M, Czosnyka M, Hutchinson P, et al.

A741 Increased risk of psychiatric diseases in patients with mildtraumatic brain injury: a nationwide cohort studyY.C. Su Dalin Tzu Chi Hospital, Buddhist Tzu Chi Medical Foundation, Chiayi, Taiwan, Province of China Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A741 Background: It is known that psychiatric disorders after traumatic brain injury are frequent. However, the relationship between mildtraumatic brain injury and psychiatric diseases has never been estab-lished. We conducted a study of patients with mild traumatic brain injury to evaluate if they had a higher risk of psychiatric diseases compared with the general population.Methods: We utilized a sampled National Health Insurance claims database containing one million beneficiaries. We followed all benefi- ciaries from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2013 to determine if they were diagnosed with psychiatric diseases. The definitions of psy-chiatric diseases in our study are schizophrenia, bipolar disorders andmajor depression. We further identified patients with mild traumatic brain injury and compared their risk of psychiatric diseases with the general population.Results: We identified 76,991 patients with mild traumatic brain in- jury and 881,511 patients without mild traumatic brain injury. After controlling for age, gender, urbanization level, socioeconomic status,liver cirrhosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes,hypertension, coronary artery disease, hyperlipidemia, history of alco- hol intoxication, malignancies, smoking, obesity, chronic renal insuffi- ciency and Charlson Comorbidity Index score, the adjusted hazardratio for psychiatric diseases was 1.46 (95 % confidence interval,1.29 \u20141.64). Conclusion: Mild traumatic brain injury may be associated with diag- noses of psychiatric diseases. A742 Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in children with pulmonary contusion S.

Medar - Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Children's Hospital at Montefiore, Pediatrics, Division of Pediatric CriticalCare, Bronx, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A742 Introduction: Thoracic injuries account for 4 % to 6 % of children hospitalized for trauma and 25 % of pediatric trauma deaths. Almost a third of patients with chest trauma are found to have pulmonary contusions (PC). There is paucity of data about prevalence of ARDS inchildren with PC.Objective: To evaluate the incidence and prevalence of PC in chil- dren with chest trauma and the association between PC and ARDS. Methods: This is a retrospective single center cohort study. Our insti- tutional Trauma registry was queried for patients 0 -18 years of age who were admitted between 5/2008 and 10/2015 with a diagnosis of PC. PC at our center was defined using radiological and clinical cri- teria. We included patients with trauma with a chest Abbreviated In-jury Score (AIS) of 2 or greater. Patient demographic, clinical dataincluding age-adjusted hypotension, initial Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) and injury of severity score (ISS) was collected. ARDS was defined using the Berlin Criteria (1) and Pediatric ARDS PALICC cri-teria (2). We excluded patients who were discharged home from theemergency department or were dead on arrival .Continuous Data is expressed as median with interquartile (IQR) ranges and compared with Mann -Whitney Utest, Fisher's Exact test, and Chi-Square test. Results: Fifty out of 1916 (2.6 %) patients less than 18 yrs. of age with trauma had PC. Of these, 58 % patients were males, and 70 % were of non-Hispanic origin (Black 42 %, White 8 % and other 50 %). Median age was 10.7 yrs (IQR 6.8, 14.3). Median hospital length ofstay (HLOS) was 8.5 (4,18) days. Ninety-six percent (48/50) neededadmission to the pediatric ICU. Median scores for GCS, AIS chest and ISS were 15 (8, 15), 3 (3, 3) and 22 (18, 29) respectively. Forty two percent (21/50) of the patients with PC needed invasive mechanicalventilation (IMV) with the median duration of ventilatory support be-ing 3 (2, 6) days. Fifty-two percent (11/21) of patients who needed ventilatory support had ARDS with a median p/f ratio of 264 (106, 426) .Patients with PC who needed invasive ventilatory support had significantly longer length of ICU stay (7.5 (4, 14) vs. 3.25 (2, 5) days,p = 0.003), lower GCS score (8 (3, 11) vs. 15 (15, 15), p = 0.0001), higher ISS score (29 (22, 34) vs. 19 (14, 22), p = 0.02), and lower S/F ratios (99 (95, 178) Vs. 461 (353, 471) compared to those who did notrequire ventilatory support. All patients with mortality (4/50) were inthe IMV group. Conclusions: Our experience demonstrated that over a quarter of pa- tients with PC will require ventilatory support and more than half ofpatients with PC requiring ventilatory support will develop ARDS. Theneed for IMV, higher ISS score and lower GCS are risk factors signifi- cantly associated with morbidity and thus help to identify high risk patients.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 379 of 607References 1.

O'Dea - Imperial College London, London, UK Intensive Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl released from activated and apoptotic cells, emerging as key indicators and mediators of disease patho- physiology. Acute increases in levels of circulating MVs have been re-ported in mechanical trauma and sepsis patients (1), but therelationship with clinical severity is unclear, due potentially to the complex dynamics of acute inflammation. Burn injury is a unique form of trauma with very well defined aetiology, onset of insults andearly clinical course, producing acute sterile SIRS in virtually all pa-tients with a moderate to severe degree of injury. Severe burns may therefore represent an optimal study population to evaluate acute MV release and its relationship to the development of SIRS. In thispilot investigation, we measured circulating MV levels following se-vere burns, with severe sepsis patients as a comparator group. Objectives: To determine the relationship between circulating MVs and early onset SIRS following severe burns injury.Methods: Patients with acute thermal injury admitted to the burns Intensive Care Unit (ICU) were prospectively studied. Baseline demo- graphic data collected included age, sex, Abbreviated Burn Score Index (ABSI) and Belgian Outcome in Burn Injury (BOBI). Blood wassampled within 24 hours of admission and centrifuged in plasma by flow cytometry. MV levels were compared to sam-ples taken from healthy volunteers and patients with severe sepsisrecruited from the general ICU. Sepsis and burns patients that died while on the ICU were classified as non-survivors. Results: All circulating MV subpopulations were elevated in burns pa- tients on day of admission (day 0) compared to healthy volunteers(leukocyte-MVs: 3.5-fold, p = 0.005; endothelial-MVs: 9.6-fold, p = 0.01), but decreased significantly by day 2. MV levels were increasedwith severe sepsis, but less consistently between patients. Leukocyte-and granulocyte-derived MVs on day 0 correlated with clinical assess- ment scores and were significantly higher in burns ICU non-survivors compared to survivors (leukocyte MVs 4.6 fold, p = 0.002; granulocyteMVs 4.8 fold, p = 0.003). Mortality prediction analysis of area under re-ceiver operating characteristic curve was 0.92 (p = 0.01) for total leukocyte MVs and 0.85 (p = 0.04) for granulocyte MVs. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate, for the first time, acute increases in circulating MVs following major burns injury andpoint to their potential role in propagation of sterile SIRS-related pathophysiology.

It is now widely ac- cepted that patients with higher injury severity benefit from Major Trauma Centre (MTC) care. This has resulted in increasing emphasis on pre-hospital triage decision tools currently based on a combin-ation of physiological data, diagnosis and mechanism of injury.Hyperglycaemia was previously observed to be a predictor of neuro- logical outcome in Traumatic Brain Injury [1] as well as associated with elevated morbidity and mortality in patients with major trauma [2 -3]. On-scene (Pre-Hospital) blood testing reflects the hyper-acute phase oftrauma and no previous studies have looked at correlation between pre-hospital capillary glucose levels and subsequent Injury Severity Score (ISS). If such a correlation exists, it may suggest a role for integrat-ing glucose measurements into pre-hospital triage models.Objective: Investigate correlation between pre-hospital hypergly- caemia and subsequent confirmed ISS and 28 day mortality. Method: Records of patients attended by our Helicopter Emer- gency Medical Service over a 9-month period were retrospect-ively examined. Clinical assess ment and interventions on-scene were contemporaneously recorded electronically by the Physician- Paramedic team including capillary glucose measurements. Inaddition, physiological, injury and outcome data was prospect-ively recorded at all MTCs by dedicated staff on a standardised national database - Trauma Audit and Research Network [4]. Pa- tients who did not undergo an on-scene glucose measurementwere not included in the study.Results: 166 patients were included in the study. Mean ISS score was 16.5 (0 -66) and overall mortality was 7.8 %. The majority [>90 %] of cases were blunt trauma patients. Linear regressionanalysis suggested a strong correlation between hyperglycaemia > 6.5 mml/L and ISS (P = 0.038) with a larger effect on ISS at a hyperglycaemia cut-off > 7.8 (P = 0.021). There was no signification correlation between pre-hospital hyperglycaemia and 28-day mor-tality or Critical Care admission within our sample.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that hyperacute elevation in blood glucose may provide an early indication of underlying se- vere injury and merits further investigation within a larger study.If our findings are replicated, glucose measurement may providea new parameter in pre-hospital triage algorithms.

Results: A total of 385 cases of major trauma were admitted in the ICU. Males outnumbered females by a ratio of 5.8:1. Theirmedian age was 25 years. Trauma admissions came mainly fromthe Accident and Emergency (84 .7 %). Motor Vehicle Collision (MVC) was the most common cause of injuries affecting 67.4 % of patients. The overall ICU length of stay (LOS) for all traumapatients ranged from 1 to 103 days (mean = 6.4 \u00b1 10.29 days).Mortality rate was 10.4 %. According to multivariate logistic regression analysis, the surgical specialty, revised trauma score < 9, injury severity core >15, the need for ventilatory supportand the use of vasopressors signifi cantly influenced mortality (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The impact of trauma on our icu has not been previously documented. This study assesses the pattern, profile, frequency, andoutcome of trauma cases admitted to the multidisciplinary ten-bedICU. The characteristics and evolution of trauma admission of this series of patients are similar to those described abroad. Mortality was in agreement with ISS and RTS scores. References 1.

Methods: This prospective observational cohort study included all patients who had severe TBI requiring decompressive craniectomybetween 2004 and 2014, in the two neurosurgical centres in Perth, Western Australia. Severe disability, vegetative state, or death were defined as unfavourable neurological outcomes. Area under thereceiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) and slope andintercept of the calibration curve were used to assess discrimination and calibration of the CRASH (Corticosteroid-Randomization-After- Significant-Head injury) and IMPACT (International-Mission-For-Prog-nosis-And-Clinical-Trial) models, respectively.Results: Of the 319 patients included in the study, 118 (37 %) had unfavourable neurological outcomes at 18-month after decom- pressive were similar in discriminating between favourable and unfavourable neurological outcome at 18-month after surgery (p = 0.690 for the difference in AUROC derived from the two models).Although both models tended to over-predict the risks of long-termunfavourable outcome, the IMPACT model had a slightly better cali- bration than the CRASH model (intercept of the calibration curve = 4.1vs. -5.7, respectively), especially when the predicted risks of un- favourable outcome were < 80 %.Conclusions: Both CRASH and IMPACT prognostic models were good in discriminating between favourable and unfavourable long-term neurological outcome for patients with severe TBI requiring decom-pressive craniectomy, but the calibration of the IMPACT full-modelwas better than the CRASH model.

Sklifosovsky Research Institute of Emergency Medicine of the Moscow Healthcare Department, Moscow,Russian Federation Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A747 Introduction: Early rehabilitation is one of the most important ther- apy issue in the Intensive care unit (ICU). One of the most essentialpart of early rehabilitation is passive verticalization provided by med- ical tilt table. However there is no information provided about verti- catization in polyvalent intensive care unit.Objective: To investigate was the passive verticalization (PV) possibil- ity and safety in the polyvalent ICU. Material and methods: We analyzed 38 episodes of PV in 14 patients of polyvalent ICU: polytrauma (n = 8), isolated, traumatic brain injury(TBI) (n = 8). Verticatization was provided by the medical tilt table. In24 (63, 2 %) cases we verticalizated patients on artificial lung ventila- tion (ALV), in 14 (36,8 %) cases on spontaneous breathing. Verticati- zation was provided up to 20\u00b0 during first session, up to 40\u00b0 duringthe second and up to 50\u00b0-60\u00b0 during the third session. Verticatizationsession was cared out gradually with the step of 10\u00b0 in 5 minutes. As the angle of inclination was reached, patient was fixed in a final pos- ition during 15 minutes. If any signs of orthostatic failure occurredthe patient was still fixed on the reached point till compensation, butnot more than for 15 minutes. The session was continued only after orthostatic failure absolute regress. If no regress happed during 15 minutes the sessions was stopped.Results: Patients on ALV successfully reached the target value during 22 (91, 7 %) sessions. Most of the sessions (19(86, 4 %)) were per- formed without complications; in 3 cases (13, 6 %) were noted some insignificant complications. Two of the sessions (8, 3 %) had to bestopped because of the orthostatic failure. Patients on spontaneousbreathing reached a target angle in 12 (85.7 %) session with no com- plications. Two of the sessions (14, 3 %) were interrupted because of the complications. The most frequent of the verticalization are tachy-cardia (n = 4 (10, 5 %)), arterial hypotension (n = 5 (13, 2 %)), tachyp-nea (n = 6 (15, 8 %)). Conclusions: In the polyvalent intensive care unit verticalization can be used safety in patients on ALV and on spontaneous breathing.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 381 of 607A748 Hyperoxia during porcine hemorrhage and resuscitation with pre-existing coronary artery disease - part i: effects on kidneyfunction and injuryE.

Antonucci - University of Genoa, Department of Surgical Sciences and Integrated Diagnostics, IRCCS San Martino IST, Genoa, Italy Intensive Care Medicine 4(Suppl 1): A748 Introduction: Hemorrhagic shock is characterised by a mismatch of O2demand and supply resulting in tissue hypoxia, inflammation and subsequent multi-organ failure (MOF)1. Hyperoxia reduced in inhealthy swine2. However, pre-existing cardiac disease increases mor- tality after trauma and hemorrhage3. Objectives: To investigate the effect of hyperoxia on kidney function during porcine hemorrhage and resuscitation with pre-existing cor-onary artery disease (CAD). Methods: Hemorrhagic shock was induced by removal of 30 % of the calculated blood volume (mean arterial pressure (MAP) 43 (40 -45) mmHg) and maintained for 3 h in anesthetized and instrumented LDL-receptor /pigs with re-transfusion of noradrenaline (NA) titrated to maintain MAPat pre-shock values for 48 h. So far, n = 7 animals were subjected tohyperoxia (FiO 21.0) during the initial 24 h of resuscitation, n = 8 pigs re- ceived standard treatment (FiO 20.3, SaO 290 %). Before, at the end of, and every 12 hours after hemorrhage, we assessed systemic and renalhemodynamics (renal artery ultrasound flow probe), kidney function (cre-atinine clearance, urinary output, renal venous blood gas analysis) as well as mitochondrial activity (high resolution respirometry) of kidney speci- mens collected at the end of the experiment. Data are median (range).Results: Survival time, NA requirements as well as systemic and renal hemodynamics were comparable in both groups. However, plasma creatinine levels were significantly lower after 36 (p < 0.01) and 48 h (p < 0.02) and creatinine clearance was significantly higher at day 2of resuscitation (115 (100 -132) ml/min vs. 64 (33 -97) ml/min; p < 1*s1; p < 0.03) and O 2flux related to ATP production (178 (171 -201) vs. 128 (95 -147) pmol*mg1*s1; p < 0.03) of renal mito- chondria were significantly higher in the hyperoxic animals. Conclusion: In our model of porcine, resuscitated hemorrhagic shock with pre-existing CAD, hyperoxia significantly improved kidney func-tion due to increased mitochondrial respiratory capacity which is ingood agreement with previous results from healthy swine 2.

Ulm, Germany;3Institute of Anesthesiological Pathophysiology and Process Development, Ulm, Germany Correspondence: C. Hartmann - Department of Anesthesiology, University Hospital, Ulm, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A749 Introduction: Hemorrhagic shock (HS) accounts for about 40 % of trauma-related deaths [1]. The severity of trauma can be furtherdeteriorated by an additional blunt chest trauma (TxT), which in- dependently contributes to mortality upon the development of acute lung injury (ALI) [2]. The development of ALI following asevere trauma is encouraged by both active and passive cigarettesmoke (CS) exposure [3]. We previously showed that CS exposure prior to TxT enhanced post-traumatic inflammation thereby ag- gravating lung injury [4].Objectives: We investigated the impact of pre-traumatic CS exposure in mice following HS alone or in combination with TxT. Methods: After 3 -4 weeks of CS-exposure, anesthetized and taneously breathing (C57BL/6) mice underwent TxT or sham sur-gery. After initiation of lung-protective mechanical ventilation viatracheostomy and instrumentation for vascular access, mice underwent 1 h of hemorrhage (mean arterial pressure (MAP) = 35 mmHg) followed by resuscitation comprising re-transfusion ofshed blood, fluid administration and noradrenaline (NA) titratedto maintain MAP > 50 mmHg. Lung mechanics, gas exchange, hemodynamics, metabolism, and acid -base status were measured together with lung and plasma cytokine and chemokine levels.After 4 h, lung and kidney were harvested for immunohistochem-istry and western blotting. Results: Pulmonary compliance was increased in chronic obstruct- ive lung disease (COPD) mice which had only received HS. Lungtissue levels of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) wereslightly elevated in nonCOPD mice which, due to more NO avail- ability, is in line with increased NA requirements to maintain hemodynamic targets. Also, systemic and pulmonary cytokine andchemokine levels as well as lung tissue expression of hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) were increased in COPD mice. Their mortality rates were similar, whereas in the combined trauma model COPD mice showed an increase in mortality and elevated NA require-ments compared to nonCOPD mice. Lung tissue HO-1 expressionwas reduced in the combined trauma model. Conclusion: CS exposure aggravated post-traumatic inflamma- tion. CS exposure prior to TxT and subsequent HS was associ-ated with increased mortality rates. As HO-1 has been reportedto act protective in ALI [5], we presume its reduction strongly highlights the severity of tra uma due to an exhausted ALI- associated anti-inflammatory defence system.

Nu\u00dfbaum - University Hospital Ulm, Anesthesiology, Ulm, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A750 Introduction: Multi-organ failure after hemorrhagic shock is triggered by tissue hypoxia and inflammation resulting from the mismatch be- tween O 2demand and supply1. In healthy swine, hyperoxia (increased FiO 2) reduced inflammation and organ dysfunction2after hemorrhagic shock and did not adversely affect myocardial function upon critical he-modilution3. Pre-existing coronary artery disease (CAD) might increase the risk of cardiac injury during low flow states. However, the use of in- creased FiO 2is restricted in acute coronary syndrome due to vasocon- striction and subsequent myocardial damage4. Objectives: To investigate the influence of hyperoxia on left ventricu- lar (LV) function during hemorrhage and resuscitation in swine with pre-existing CAD.Methods: Hemorrhagic shock was induced by removal of 30 % of the calculated blood volume (target mean arterial pressure (MAP) 40 mmHg) and maintained for 3 h in anesthetized LDL-receptor/pigs with high fat diet-induced hypercholesterolemia and CAD5. re-transfusion of crystalloids and noradrenaline(NA) to maintain MAP at pre-shock values for 48 h. Amiodarone was used if needed to treat arrhythmia. So far, n = 7 pigs were subjected to hyper- oxia (FiO 21.0) for the initial 24 h of resuscitation, n = 8 pigs received standard treatment (FiO 20.3, SaO2 90 %). Before, at the end of, and every 12 hours after hemorrhage, we assessed hemodynamics and LV function (pressure-condu ctance catheter) and cardiac mitochondrial ac- tivity at the end of the experiment. Data are median (IQR).Results: Survival time, hemodynamics and total doses of NA and ami- odarone did not significantly differ between groups. Dp/dt maxtransi- ently increased after resuscitation and decreased again in both groups, whereas dp/dt minand the isovolumic relaxation constant tau remained largely unaffected throughout the experiment despite highdoses of NA and tachycardia. Together with the mostly unchanged ejection fraction, the fall in stroke volume and the rise in filling pres- sure (pulmonary artery occlusion pressure) after re-transfusion indi-cate increased LV stiffness and dysfunction in both groups.However, all cardiac parameters and mitochondrial respiratory cap- acity of the heart did not show any significant differences between hyperoxic and control animals.Conclusion: In our porcine model of resuscitated hemorrhagic shock with pre-existing CAD, hyperoxia did not exert detrimental effects with respect to LV function. Therefore, hyperoxic treat- ment appears to be a safe approach for the treatment of O 2defi- ciency in hemorrhagic shock even under conditions with pre-existing cardiac comorbidity. References 1.

We inves- tigated the role of DNA sequence variation in modulating the ob- served changes in gene expression.Objectives: Our aim was to reveal the most relevant regulatory genetic variants of the host response to elective cardiac surgery and the clinical relevance of the variants detected. To identify these regulatory variants we performed an Expression Quantitative Analysis(e-QTL).Methods: The Ambion LeukoLOCK Total RNA Isolation System was used to purify leukocytes from whole blood isolated before in- duction of anaesthesia and 24 hours after surgery. Gene expres-sion was quantified using Illumina HumanHT-12 v4 expressionbeadchip . The output of this analysis was filtered by fold expres- sion and P-values were corrected to false discovery rate < 0.05. Genotyping was performed on OmniExpressed-12v1chip. e-QTLSanalysis was peformed using Matrix e-QTL software. Pathwaysanalysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (web based software). Results: 46 patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery involving cardiopulmonary bypass (CBP) were recruited. Postoperative recoverywas uneventful with only minor complications. Of the genes differentially regulated 24 hours after cardiac surgery 80 were up-regulated and 15 were down -regulated. The group ofup-regulated genes are primarily related to the innate immune re-sponse and cell signalling. Of the 15 downregulated the majority are implicated in T lymphocyte activation. We identified 659 single nucleotide polymorphisms (10.E-06) that aresignificantly associated with the cis regulation of 218 genes, 24 hoursafter cardiac surgery.

Interestingly, we detected genes/pathways not conven-tionally associated with the host response to cardiac surgery suchas cell proliferation, cell differentiation and cell signalling. Pro- inflammatory and anti-inflammatory genes operate simultaneously rather than sequentially after cardiac surgery and CPB. References 1. Ramlawi B et al.

A752 Association between perioperative intravenous fluid administration strategy and renal outcomes in patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery: anobservational studyI.-J. Jun, W.-J. Kim, E.-H. Lee Asan Medical Center, Department of Anesthesia, Seoul, Republic of KoreaCorrespondence: I.-J. Jun - Asan Medical Center, Department of Anesthesia, Seoul, Republic of Korea Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A752 Introduction: Saline-based and hydroxyethyl starch solutions are commonly used for volume resuscitation, but have been linked to an increased risk of renal dysfunction. Objective: To assess whether balanced solutions and a limited vol-ume of hydroxyethyl starch (renal-protective fluid management[RPF] strategy) during perioperative period could decrease the in- cidence of postoperative renal dysfunction and improve clinical outcomes. Method: This retrospective study investigated 2613 patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery. A group of patients undergo-ing cardiovascular surgery from January 1, 2010 to July 4, 2012were included in the control group and were given intravenous fluids with saline-based solutions and hydroxyethyl starch perio- peratively. The other group of patients undergoing cardiovascularsurgery from July 23, 2012 to December 31, 2013 formed the RPFgroup and were given balanced solution and a limited volume of hydroxyethyl starch solution. The primary outcome was the inci- dence of postoperative acute kidney injury (AKI) using serum cre-atinine. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of severeAKI, requirement for renal replacement therapy, renal outcome at the time of discharge. Propensity score and multivariable regres- sion analyses were performed to assess the association of fluidmanagement strategy with renal outcomes. Result: In the entire cohorts, postoperative AKI, severe AKI, in- hospital renal replacement therapy, and persistent AKI at dis- charge occurred in 213 (21.2 %), 54 (5.4 %), 29 (2.9 %), and 52 (5.2 %) patients of RPF group compared to 696 (43.2 %), 254(15.8 %), 79 (4.9 %), and 194 (12.1 %) patients of control group,respectively. In the propensity score matched cohort, the inci- dence of AKI, severe AKI, in-hospital RRT, and persistent AKI at discharge were also lower in the RPF group than in the controlgroup. After adjusting by the multivariable analyses, the RPFgroup was independently associated with a lower risk of postop- erative AKI, severe AKI, use of renal replacement therapy, shorter postoperative extubation time and intensive care unit and hos-pital stay.Conclusion: The RPF strategy was associated with improved acute renal and clinical outcomes after cardiovascular surgery. These findings support the need for definitive clinical studies on RPFstrategy.References 1. Yunos NM, Bellomo R, Hegarty C, et al.

Besch - University of Franche-Comt\u00e9, Besan\u00e7on, Medicine 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A753 Introduction: Intravenous infusion of short-acting insulin remains the gold standard treatment of stress hyperglycemia after coronary ar-tery graft bypass (CABG) surgery despite the risk of insulin-related hypoglycemia. Exenatide is an agonist of the pancreatic and inhibitspancreatic glucagon production. The risk of exenatide-relatedhypoglycemia is theoretically null as the effect of exenatide depends on the blood glucose level. Objectives: The aim of the ExSTRESS study was to assess the efficacy and the safety of intravenous exenatide in the management of stresshyperglycemia after CABG The ExSTRESS study (NCT01969149) was a one-center randomized phase II trial. Patients scheduled for CABG surgerybetween January and December, 2015 were eligible. Non-inclusion criteria were: insulin-re quiring diabetes mellitus, creatin- ine clearance 60 ml/min, and a medical history of pancreatec- tomy, acute or chronic pancreatitis. Intravenous exenatide (EXEgroup) or intravenous insulin (INS group) was randomly allocatedto achieve a blood glucose target between 5.5 and 7.7 mmol/l. A validated insulin therapy protocol was used in the INS group [1]. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients achievingthe blood glucose target during at least half of the first 48 post-operative hours. The secondary outcomes were: incidence of moderate (<3.3 mmol/l) and severe (<2.2 mmol/l) hypoglycemia during the first 48 postoperative hours, and the incidence of ad-verse events at Day 30. According to the study protocol (O'Brienand Fleming plan for analysis), no statistical test was used for in- tergroup comparison. Data are presented as mean (standard devi- ation) or number of patients (percentage).Results: 54 and 52 patients were included respectively in the EXE and in the INS groups (age : 70 (9) vs 68 (11) years; male : 49 (91) vs 42 (81); diabetes mellitus : 12 (27) vs 11 (26); HbA1c : 6.1 (0.7) vs 5.8 (0.6) %; Euroscore : 6.4 (2.3) vs 6.1 (2.7) %; respectively in the EXEand in the INS groups). 39 (72) and 39 (75) achieved the blood glu-cose target during at least half of the first 48 postoperative hours re- spectively in the EXE and in the INS groups. The mean blood glucose value was 6.9 (0.5) mmol/l vs 6.9 (0.4) mmol/l respectively in the EXEand in the INS groups. 0 (0) and 0 (0) patient has presented at leastone episode of severe hypoglycemia and 2 (4) vs 1 (2) patients suf- fered from at least one moderate hypoglycemia respectively in the EXE and in the INS groups. 6 (11) vs 3 (6) patients did not requireintravenous insulin respectively in the EXE and in the INS groups. Noexenatide-related adverse event has been reported at Day 30.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 384 of 607Conclusions: Intravenous exenatide allows a safe management of stress hyperglycemia after CABG surgery but requires intravenous in- sulin rescue therapy in most patients.

Methods: This is a pilot study that included 20 cardiac surgery pa- tients. Ten patients were assigned to receive CPB + OXIRIS \u00aeduring cardiac surgery and 10 patients were assigned to receive standardCPB. Blood samples were collected and clinical variables were re- corded (just before connection to CPB (T0), just before ending CPB (T1), at intensive care unit (ICU) admission (T2), and 24 hours afterICU admission (T3)). Clinical variables were registered from CPB andup to 24 hours from ICU admission, including any adverse effect ob- served during the use of OXIRIS \u00aemembrane. Results: Twelve patients underwent coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, 3 patients uderwent valve replacement surgery, and5 patients underwent mixed surgery (CABG plus valve replacement). No safety events were registered in both groups. Mean age was 65.9 \u00b1 9 years and 85 % of patients were male. Mean baselineserum creatinine was 89 \u00b1 15 mol/L, and mean CPB time was 113 \u00b1 38 minutes. At T1, mean concentration of cytokines was not statistically different between groups. In CPB-OXIRIS\u00ae group, IL-1 and IL-6 levels were lower as compared with standard CBP.Interleukin-4 and IL-10 were increased in the CPB-OXIRIS\u00ae group,whereas tumor necrosis factor- levels were not different be- tween groups. At T2, mean serum levels of IL-1 and IL-6 were in- creased in both groups. Furthermore, no adverse effects wereobserved in CBP-OXIRIS\u00ae group during follow up.Conclusions: No adverse effects were observed with the use of OXI- RIS\u00ae, neither during CPB nor after 24 hours of surgery. Therefore, theuse of an increased adsorption membrane connected to CPB is safe and feasible. A755 Evolution of diaphragmatic dysfunction after cardiac surgeryP. CHLO, Lisboa, Portugal;3Zurich University Hospital, Zurich, Switzerland;4Georges Pompidou European Hospital, France Correspondence: P. Cavaleiro - Algarve Hospital Center, Faro Unit, Faro, Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A755 Introduction: Diaphragmatic dysfunction is a known complication of cardiac surgery associated with delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. Its incidence and evolution has not been established in detail. Echographic evaluation of diaphragmatic excursion is a simple,non-invasive technique that can be used at the bedside to monitordiaphragmatic function. Objectives: To evaluate the incidence and evolution of diaphrag- matic dysfunction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted from 16/10 to 23/12/2015 at a tertiary cardiac surgical center in France. Consecutive elective adult patients operated via a median sternot- omy with cardiopulmonary bypass were enrolled. Demographic datawas collected. Echographic measurements of right and left hemi-diaphragm excursions were obtained using anatomical M-Mode and averaged over 3 respiratory cycles before surgery (E1), within 48 h following extubation (E2) and between 96 and 144 h after extubation(E3). Values were compared using Friedman's analysis for repeatedmeasures and Wilcoxon test for paired samples. Diaphragmatic dysfunction was defined as an excursion < 1 cm, as previously re- ported 1,2. An inter-observer reproducibility evaluation was per- formed using Bland-Altman analysis.Results: 143 patients were submitted to cardiac surgery during the study period, of which 106 fulfilled inclusion criteria. 26 patients were not included: 8 did not consent, machine or operator were unavail-able in 19 patients at E1. 80 patients were included and 79 were ana-lysed (1 patient withdrew consent). The evolution of right and left hemi-diaphragmatic excursion is shown in graph 1. After establishing pre-op baseline values (E1), we observed a shorter excursion aftersurgery (E2) with partial recovery at E3 (Table 78). Patients that did not develop dysfunction followed a similar pattern. At E2, unilateral dysfunction was observed in 25 patients (37 %) and bilateral dysfunc- tion in 4 (5 %). At E3, unilateral dysfunction remained in 9 patients(13 %).Conclusions: Diaphragmatic excursion was reduced after surgery but returned mostly to normal by day 5. 30 % of patients developed a diaphragmatic dysfunction but this was not associated with clinicallyrelevant complications in this small cohort.

Esbaga D. Hospital 12 de Octubre, Madrid, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A756 Introduction: Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) is a potential complication in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This clinical situation can be associated with increased morbidity (including acute deterioration of renal function) and mortality. Objetive: Descriptive analysis of patients undergoing cardiac surgery and has a low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS), its relationship with renal failure and association with mortality. Methods: Observational, prospective, multicenter study of patients admitted to the ICU during the post-surgical period and develops a LCOS (2012 Consensus definition). Preoperative data (type of inter- vention, cardiac function, risk scores), intraoperative variables (type of surgery, CEC, use of inotropic) and postoperative data to hospitaldischarge (including complications / postoperative mortality) are re- corded. Descriptive statistics, ANOVA and Chi2 analysis, from June 2014 to June 2015. Data analyzed using SPSS-windows. Results: 14 centers have provided 138 patients with LCOS (age 68.3 \u00b1 9.3 years; 65 % male) operated mostly scheduled basis (59.4 %, 33.3 % urgency and 6.5 % emergency) with an Euroscore of 9.99 \u00b1 13. Isolated myocardial revascularization (16.8 %) or accompanied by valve surgery (24.8 %) and aortic valve replacement (11.7 %) were the most frequent procedures. Most relevant antecedents: AMI (31.9 %; 22 cases in the pre-intervention 90 days), severe pulmonary hypertension (21.7 %), critical preoperative state (18.8 %), previous cardiac surgery (18.1 %), PTCA / stent (16.7 %), LVEF < 35 % (33.6 %), and NYHA III-IV (52.9 %). Prior to surgery, 21 patients (15.4 %) requir- ing vasoactive drugs. 70.1 % needed two (or more) vasoactive drugs for exit of the CPB (mean 147.4 \u00b1 60 min). Postoperatively, 46.7 % of patients with LCOS (n = 63) develops acute deterioration of renal function (39 % AKI1, 23 % AKI2 and 37.7 % AKI3). The time to worst creatinine value was 41 \u00b1 46 hours. 20 % required renal replacement technique; there is significant difference in the cardiogenic shock (CS) group (11.4 % LCOS, 14.6 % clinical group and 36.6 % CS, p = 0.007). Analyzing by subgroup of AKI (worst recorded value in the evolution), the AKI3 stage was associated with multiorgan failure (MOF) (17.4 % AKI1, 28.6 % AKI2, 68.2 % AKI3, p = 0.001), total days income (p = 0.03) and ICU mortality (16.7 % AKI1, 28.6 % AKI2 and 69.6 % AKI3, p = 0.001). Conclusions: LCOS patients have a high incidence of acute deterior- ation of renal function and need for renal replacement technique. The AKI stadium is associated with increased development of MOF and mortality. A757 Evaluation of inmature platelets fraction in patients undergoing cardiac surgery: a pilot study J.C. Lopez Delgado1, C. Imperiali2, Lopez Universitari de Bellvitge, Intensive Care, L' Hospitalet de Llobregat, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A757 Introduction: The degree of severe inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) after CS is related with the development of complications in cardiac surgery (CS). The Inmature Platelets Fraction (IPF) has been recently associated with inflammatory response after sepsis. How- ever, its role related with the injury during CS is unknown. Objectives: To evaluate the role and clinical usefulness of IPF blood levels as a tool to detect patients suffering clinically significant SIRS after CS. Methods: Prospective, observational study in our Surgical ICU in a tertiary-level university hospital. IPF was measured on admission and 24 h after CS, together with clinical data and outcomes including in- hospital mortality. Clinically significant SIRS was defined as need of vasoconstrictors >24 h in the ICU for maintaining appropriate MAP and diuresis. Results: 37 patients were included 57 % were active smokers, 69 % suffer from Hypertension, 34 % were diabetic and 60 % dyslipidemia. 74.3 % was elective surgery. 37.8 % (n = 14) suffered SIRS. Univariate analysis showed that the variables associated with SIRS age (HR: 1.12;95 % IC: 1.01-1.24; P bypass (min) (HR:1.03; 95 % IC: 1.002-1.05; P = 0.029), ICU transfusion needs (Red Blood Cells units) (HR: 1.93; 95 % IC: 1.09-3.42; P = 0.024), Urea (First after CS) (HR: 1.47; 95 % IC: 1.09-1.97; IC: 1.001- 1.508; P = 0.048) were factors associated with the presence of SIRS.Table 78 (abstract A755).

Patients who did not develop SIRS had a negative IPF whereas it was positive in those who developed SIRS (P = 0.0005).Conclusions: Patients who have a positive IPF are prone to develop clinically significant SIRS in our pilot study. Despite our results seem promising, more research is still needed in order to know the role ofIPF in SIRS after CS. References 1. De Blasi R, Cardelli P, Costante A, Sandri M, Mercieri M, Arcioni R.

G\u00f3rka - Jagiellonian University Medical College, IInd Department of Internal Medicine, Krak\u00f3w, Poland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A758 Introduction: Every year, 200 million pat ients undergo noncar- diac surgery worldwide. More than one million of them diewithin 30 days as a result of perioperative complications. Overthe years, venous thromboembolism (VTE) due to deep vein thrombosis (DVT) was considered as the most important and most dangerous complication after surgery, but recentlyphenomenon of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery(MINS) definied as elevation in cardiac troponins level caught the attention of researchers. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare the frequencies of venous (DVT) and arterial (MINS) complications in vascular surgerypatients, and to evaluate their impact on the short (30-days) and long-term (1-year) prognosis after surgery. Methods: 167 patients operated due to peripheral arterial disease of lower limbs (PAD) or abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) in theVascular Surgery Unit of a tertiary care hospital in Krakow were enrolled in the study. Every patient had high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T serum level measured before surgery and four timesafter procedure. In every patient lower extremities venous ultra-sound with B-mode compression test was performed three times (before surgery and in the 4 thand 7th day after surgery) by ex- perienced physician. All patients were monitored for cardiovascu-lar complications during hospital stay, 30 days and one yearfollow-up after surgery. Results: DVT was diagnosed in 4 patients after surgery (2.4 %). MINS defined as an increase in TnT after surgery by at least30 % compared with baseline level and a level of > 0.03 ug/L(normal range 0 -0,014 ug/L) was observed in 25 patients (15 %). Annual mortality in patients with MINS was clearly higher than in the group without MINS (6 (24 %) vs 12 (8.5 %); p = 0.02). Among pa-tients with DVT we did not observed deaths in the year of follow-up.Conclusions: Perioperative myocardial injury is more common com- plication than venous thromboembolism after noncardiac surgeryand has a more significant impact on the patient's prognosis during annual observation.

A number of demographic and clinical variables taken from the Hos- pital database are analyzed. A univariate and multivariate logistic re-gression model was used to study the observed effect and wasadjusted for potential confounders / mediators. The odds ratio (OR) with their respective confidence interval of 95 % was reported. P- values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results: A total of 3449 patients were included in the study. Age: 66.88 +/ 11.9 years old; 65.2 % male.229 patients died during the ICU stay. In the univariate analysis, patients who survive: were more often male, younger: 66.81 +/ 12.64 vs 67.84 +/ 12.43 years 0.05); They had lower ICU stay 6.63 +/ 14.24 vs 10.60 +/ 13.99 days (p < 0.01); less postoperative bleeding in the first 24 hours of ICU ad- mission: 0.55 +/ 1.27 vs 1.1 +/ 1.29 liters (p < 0.01); higher pre- operative hemoglobin: 13.64 +/ 5.8 vs 12.31 +/ 2.02 g / dl (p < 0.01); shorter time of cardiopulmonary bypass: 101.66 +/ 23.6 vs +/ +/4.33 vs 10.27 +/ (p and RBC transfu- sion: 1.59 +/ 2.25 vs 3.62 +/ 2.63 packed red blood cells (p < 0.01).

Objectives: To identify perioperative factors and describe indications and outcome indices associated with ICU readmission after cardiac surgery performed under the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: A total of 1334 consecutive patients who underwent cardiac surgery during a 3 years period were retrospectively analyzed. Patients who readmitted in ICU consisted group A and were compared with group B, the rest of the cohort. The following factors were compared between 2 groups: gender, severe obesity (BMI > 35), smoking habit, diabetes mellitus, COPD, pre-op pulmonary hypertension (SPAP > 30 mmHg), pre-op ejection fraction < 50 %, cardiopulmonary bypass time (CPB) > 120 min,prolonged mechanical ventilation- defined as > 24 hours (during initial ICU stay),transfusion with >3red blood cell (RBC) units, re-intubation, acute kidney injury(AKI- RIFLE criteria), need of renal replacement therapy, post-op atrial fibrillation and mortality. Stat- istical analysis was based on x square test. Results: A total of 29 (2.17 %) patients readmitted in ICU. Group A patients were older (68,6 \u00b1 9.8 vs 65,3 \u00b1 10) \u00b1 6 vs1.99 \u00b1 2.1).Indications for readmission failure(8),cardiac arrest(4), stroke(3), pulmonary readmission were: severe obesity(10/29, p = < 0.01), COPD(11/29, p = < 0.01), red blood transfusion with > 3 units(15/29, p < 0.01) and prolonged initial mechanical ventilation(4/29, p = 0.018). Statistical significant outcome indices were: re-intubation(12/ 29, p = < 0.01), AKI(18/29, p = < 0.01), need of renal replacement ther- apy(8/29, p < 0.01) and post-op atrial fibrillation(19/29, p 0.01). Mor- tality was 10.3 (3/29) vs 2.84 % of group B. Conclusions: COPD, severe obesity, prolonged ventilation and blood transfusions appear to be major factors for ICU readmission. LCOS is the most common indication. Incidence of re-intubation, AKI, need for renal replacement therapy, atrial fibrillation and mortality are higher in this group of patients References 1.

Uz - Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Transaltional Physiology, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A761Introduction: The management of tissue perfusion in cardiac surgery with fluid therapy is a challenging task as the parameters used to as- sess it do not reflect microcirculatory dysfunction. Heterogeneity in blood flow perfusion and abnormalities in capillary density characterize microcirculation dysfunction and can be assessed with incident dark- field illumination (IDF) imaging of the sublingual tissue. The restoration of abnormalities for capillaries can become a target parameter for the administering of fluids in the future in addition to the restoration of the macro circulatory parameters solely used nowadays. Objectives: Visualizing the sublingual microcirculation to assess sys- temic tissue perfusion and fluid overload in post-operative cardiac surgery patients, to propose a more accurate method to help assess tissue perfusion in patients who undergo surgical procedures. Methods: In this prospective observational study videos of the sub- lingual microcirculation on post cardiac surgery patients were re- corded with the use of the CytoCam (Braedius Medical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). Data was obtained in day one after the patients left the intensive care unit (ICU). The data was recorded straight after surgery at T0 followed by a two day T1 and T2 measurement. Three videos were recorded at each time point. AVA software v. 3.2 (Micro- Vision Medical, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) was used to obtain the following microcirculatory parameters: total vessel density (TVD), microcirculatory flow index of perfused vessel (PPV), perfused vessel density (PVD). Macro circulatory parameters were also collected in those time points. The weight is measured be- fore the operation (T0), second (T1)and third day(T2) in the post- operative cardiac surgery ward. Results: 10 post-operative cardiac patients are included comprised of 3 females and 7 males. Varied group in cardiac surgery compromis- ing of 5 patients which have undergone coronary bypass graft sur- gery and 5 aortic valve surgery. The patients came directly from the intensive care to the post-operative cardiac ward with a fluid over- load which is currently expressed in a weight gain. All these patients have received daily furosemide and spironolactone to account for the fluid overload. Pre-operative T0(76 \u00b1 12.6), T1(78 \u00b1 12) T2 (77 \u00b1 11.7) in 8 patients. There was a significant increase in the weight at T1 compared to baseline (P: 0.0065), and a significant de- crease in the weight T2 compared to T1(P: 0.0193).There was a sig- nificant increase in the TVD when comparing the T1 to T0 (24 \u00b1 3.2, 20 \u00b1 3.3 p = 0.0410), and T2 to T0 (26 \u00b1 3.3 20 \u00b1 2.7 P = 0.0005). Conclusions: The TVD increased during the three days whilst the weight decreased possible due to the diuretics. The cytocam is a po- tential tool to monitor the microcirculation and can indicate and asses fluid overload. References 1. Tanaka S et al. . Crit Care. 2015 Nov 6;19:388. 2. Kara A et al.

Vicka, D. Gineityte, D. Vicka - Vilnius Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A762 Introduction: Despite being widely studied, origins of impaired neurologic status after cardiac surgery are not fully understood. One of the commonly reported predisposing factor is the perioperative change in sodium concentration. Objectives: The aim of this study is to determine whether periopera- tive change of sodium is linked to impaired postoperative neuro- logical status. Methods: The observational study was conducted in a tertiary refer- ence university hospital. Data of cardiac surgery patients were gath- ered and analyzed. The sodium concentrations were measured before the surgery, upon admission to the ICU and 24 hours later. The mean values and the changes of sodium during these periods were evaluated. The neurological status of the patients was evalu- ated for one day after the surgery. Impaired postoperative neuro- logical status (INS) was defined as delirium, seizures or impaired consciousness after withdrawal of sedation and extubation of the pa- tient in the first 24 postoperative hours. The perioperative sedation and analgesia was executed according to the routine protocol of the hospital. To determine the most potent predictor of INS a regression analysis of sodium measures was performed. The most potent so- dium measurement was further analyzed in a multivariate regression analysis of INS risk factors adjusted for demographic variables, pre- operative comorbidities, operative characteristics and early postoper- ative complications. Results: The data of 262 patients were gathered. Most of the patients were men 65.6 % (N = 172), had a CABG procedure 62.6 % (N = 164) with a low operative risk of median Euroscore II value of 1.62 [0.97- 2.35]. The rate of INS in the group was 9.9 % (N = 26). The mean value of preoperative sodium was 139.57 \u00b1 3.00 24 h later 137.76 \u00b1 2.65 mmol/ L, resulting in an operative change of 2.1 [0.0-4.4] mmol/L, and 24 h postoperative change of ( ) 1.85 [( ) 4.5-0.90] mmol/L. The most po- tent predictor of INS was the 24 h postoperative change of sodium (OR = 0.818 CI95%: p < 0.001). The multivariate regres- sion analysis of INS risk factors revealed the 24 h postoperative change of sodium (OR = 0.80 CI 95 %: 0.71-0.90 p < 0.001) and pres- ence of rethoracotomy as risk factors (OR = 5.28 CI95%: 1.40-19.09 p = 0.014) of INS. The results are presented in the chart below. Conclusions: The INS after cardiac surgery is present in a substantial part of the patients. The most potent predictor of an INS is the 24 hpostoperative change of sodium concentration, resulting in a seven- fold risk increase per every drop of 5 mmol/L of sodium. A763 How safe is gelatin? A systematic review and meta-analysis of gelatin-containing plasma Hospital, Department for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Jena, Germany;2Jena University Hospital, Center for Sepsis Control and Care, Jena, Germany;3McMaster University, Department of Medicine (Division of Critical Care) & Department of Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics, Hamilton, C. M\u00f6ller - Jena University Hospital, Department for Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Jena, Germany Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A763 Introduction: Gelatin is a synthetic colloid resuscitation fluid for treatment of hypovolemia. Gelatin efficacy and safety are poorly eval- uated. Despite lack of evidence, gelatin use is widespread and in- creasing in parts of the world. We wanted to systematically review efficacy and adverse outcomes. Given the paucity of data from RCTs, we also included data from non-randomised trials. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised and non-randomised studies comparing gelatin with crystalloid or albumin for treatment of hypovolemia. Adverse outcomes were defined as mor- tality, allogeneic blood transfusion, acute kidney injury, anaphylaxis and extravascular uptake. Multiple databases were searched systematically without language restrictions until August 2015 Central, Medline, Scholar, Grey Literature, German Na- tional Library, German Pharmacovigilance Database and Clinical Trials Registries). Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool for RCTs and the Ottawa Newcastle scale for observational studies. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Results: 60 studies were included, consisting of 30 RCTs with 3629 pa- tients, 8 non-randomised studies with 10827 patients and 22 animal studies. For those receiving gelatin, the relative risks (RR) were as fol- lows: for mortality (RR 1.18, 95 % CI 0.98-1.41, 16 RCTs, 2525 patients; low certainty in evidence), requiring allogeneic blood transfusion (RR 1.25, 95 % CI 0.95-1.64, 8 RCTs, 744 patients; low certainty in evidence), acute kidney injury (RR 1.32, 95 % CI [0.61, 2.87], 3 RCTs, 212 patients, very low certainty in evidence), anaphylactic adverse effects (RR 2.18, 95 % CI 0.87-5.44, 3 RCTs 872 patients, very low certainty of evidence). Mean crystalloid-to-colloid ratio was 1.44 (\u00b10.31, 6 RCTs). Four observa- tional controlled studies (9403 patients, low risk of bias) all found an in- creased risk for acute kidney injury (AKI) or need for renal replacement therapy (RRT). Between 17 to 31 % of administered gelatin was taken up extravascularly. The mean crystalloid-to-colloid ratio was 1.4. Conclusions: Despite the poor quality of published evidence, this systematic review shows that Gelatin solutions increase the risk of anaphylaxis and may be harmful by increasing mortality, renal failure Fig. 110 (abstract A761).

Plasma expansion with gelatin is not associated with a relevant fluid-sparing benefit. Until well-designed RCTs show gelatinis safe we caution against the use of gelatins since cheaper and saferfluid alternatives are available.

Zanabili Al Universitario Central Cardiac Gonz\u00e1lez P\u00e9rez - Hospital Universitario Central de Asturias, Intensive Care Unit 1 -2, Oviedo, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A764 Introduction: Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion has been associated with increased in-hospital morbidity and mortality after cardiacsurgery. However, the impact on quality of life has not been fully clarified. Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyze whether transfusion of RBC has an impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods: Prospective observational study of 205 patients undergo- ing cardiac surgery (valve replacement and / or coronary revasculari-zation) between January and April of 2015 at a University Hospital. Clinical data relating to patient comorbidities, surgery and postopera- tive course were collected, including hemoglobin pre and post-surgery and the number of blood products transfused periopera-tively. At 6 months after discharge, was applied EUROQUOL- 5D questionnaire for assessing the HRQOL through telephone interview. Significant variables in the univariate analysis were entered into amultivariate logistic regression model to calculate the Odds Ratio(OR) with confidence interval 95 %. Results: Questionnaire response 178 patients (61.2 % males, age 70.7 \u00b1 9.8). They were divided into two groups: group 1: problems in some di-mension of HRQOL of EUROQOL 5D and group 2: without problems. In the Univariate analysis,group 2 patients (with problems) presented the following characteristics: were older (p < 0.01); were mostly males (p <0.01); lower preoperative hemoglobin (p < 0.05), received more RBC (p <0.01) as well as a higher Hospitality stay (p < 0.01). Patients receiving more RBC have a further deterioration in HRQOL (OR 1.23, 95 % CI 1.07 to 1.41, p = 0.004) .In multivariate analysis, transfusion of more RBCcauses more deterioration in HRQOL after adjusting for age and genderOR (1.18, 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.34), p = 0.012 ); by preoperative and postopera- tive hemoglobin (OR 1.19, 95 % CI 1.04 to 1.37, p = 0.013) but not by stay (OR 1.11, 95 % CI 0.95 to 1.28), p = 0.184) considering stay a mediatorin the causal chain. Conclusions Transfusion of packed red blood cells reduces HRQOL after cardiacsurgery. References 1. Cladellas M, Bruguera J, Comin J, Vila J, de Jaime E, Marti J, et al.

Tamura - Kochi Medical School, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Nankoku, Japan Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A765 Introduction: Given that surgical procedures have become minimally invasive, we thought that postoperative energy expenditure wouldbe decreased. In fact, the resting energy expenditure (REE) measured by an indirect calorimeter after minimally invasive esophagectomy in the intensive care unit (ICU) was significantly lower than the basalenergy expenditure (BEE) estimated using the Harris-Benedict equa-tion (HBE) [1]. However, postoperative REE after cardiovascular sur- gery remains unclear. Objectives: We hypothesized that the postoperative REE would be lower than the BEE in patients in the ICU who had undergone cardio-vascular surgery and conducted a prospective observational study to investigate it. Methods: The ethics committee from our hospital approved this pro- spective study. This study included patients who underwent cardio-vascular surgery in our hospital from September 2013 to March 2015. After surgery, the REE was measured using an Engstr\u00f6m device (GE Healthcare Japan, Tokyo, Japan), which consists of a ventilator andan indirect calorimeter, and was measured from the time from ICUadmission to extubation or at 9 AM on postoperative day 1. The pa- tients received pressure-controlled ventilation (tidal volume: 6 - 10 mL/kg) in the ICU under dexmedetomidine and propofol sedation.The ventilation setting and the doses of these sedative agents wereadjusted by each physician in accordance with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS). Patients received an infusion of a 10 % glucose solution at a rate of 192 kcal/day after admission intothe ICU. We maintained the blood glucose level between 110 to180 mg/dL using an artificial pancreas (STG-55, Nikkiso, Tokyo, Japan). The following data were obtained: age, body weight, height, RASS, and REE for each hour during ventilation. The REE and the BEEestimated using the HBE were compared using the paired t-test. Results: Forty-seven patients (23 female and 24 male) were enrolled in this study. The mean age, body weight, and height were 73 \u00b1 10 years (mean \u00b1 standard deviation), 55 \u00b1 10 kg, and 155 \u00b1 10 cm, respectively.Seventy three percent of patients received a cardiopulmonary bypass(CBP). The average temperature and RASS during ventilation were 38.2 \u00b1 3.3 \u00b0C and 3 \u00b1 1, respectively. The average REE during ventilation was 1314 \u00b1 148 kcal/day (23.9 was1147 \u00b1 148 kcal/day. The average REE during ventilation was signifi-cantly higher than the BEE (114 \u00b1 35 % of the BEE, p = 0.02). In addition, the REE was not significantly different between patients who received a CBP and patients who did not receive a CBP.Conclusions: The REE after cardiovascular surgery was significantly higher than the BEE regardless of whether a CBP was performed. In postoperative patients, it is important to note the difference in surgi- cal procedures when estimating the optimal target calorie level fornutrition therapy. References [1] Asia Pac J Clin Nutr.

Papanikolaou Hospital, Cardiac Surgery ICU, Thessaloniki, Greece Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A766 Introduction: Connective tissue diseases represent a rare, heteroge- neous group of diseases that commonly impair the function of many organs. Objectives: Aim of this study was to determine whether a history of connective tissue disease has any impact on postoperative morbidityand mortality in patients who undergo cardiac surgery under the use of cardiopulmonary bypass. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed our electronic database of 1618 consecutive cardiac surgery patients from May 2012 to March2016. We analyzed the postoperative outcome indices of cardiac sur- gical patients with a history of connective tissue disease. Results: A total of 15 (5 females) patients were identified (group A): 12 rheumatoid arthritis, 2 ankylosing spondylitis, 1 psoriatic arthritis.Oral steroids were used in 6 and methotrexate in 3 patients. The fol- lowing operations were performed (1 emergency): 8 valve surgery, 5 coronary artery bypass and 2 operations on thoracic aorta. Compar-ing with the rest of the cohort (group B), the study group patients:were older (69,6 \u00b1 7 vs 65,2 \u00b1 10), their average pre-op mean ejection fraction was 57,3 \u00b1 10 % vs 55,6 \u00b1 11 % vs 73,7 hypertension- defined as pre-op doppler systolic pulmonary pressure > 30 mmHg-was found in 5/15 patients (36,6 % vs 22,49 %, p = 0,34). Median dur- ation of mechanical ventilation was 11 hours for group A vs 7 hours for group B. Transfusion with > 3 red blood units was required in 5/15 (36,6 % vs 23,4 %, p = 0,36). Post-op cardiac output syndromedeveloped in 2/15 (13,3 % vs 5,49 %, p = 0,43). Acute kidney injury defined by RIFLE criteria complicated 2/15 patients (13,3 % vs 15,6 %, p (46,6 %vs 33,6 %, p = 0,31). One patient required non invasive ventilation forpost-op respiratory failure. Median ICU days were 2 in both groups. No patient of the study group developed sternal wound infection or had prolonged (>24 hours) mechanical ventilation while hospitalmortality was 0 %.Conclusions: According to the results of this single-center retrospect- ive study, cardiac surgery procedures could be performed safely in patients with a history of connective tissue disease.

Hathorn - Brigham and Women's Hospital, Department of Medicine, Boston, USA Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A767 Introduction: Red Cell Distribution width (RDW) is associated with mortality and bloodstream infection risk in the critically ill. In survi- vors of critical care with chronic liver disease (CLD) it is not know ifRDW can predict subsequent risk of all-cause mortality following hos- pital discharge. Objectives: We hypothesized that an increase in RDW at hospital dis- charge in CLD patients who received critical care would be associ-ated with increased mortality following hospital discharge. Methods: We performed a two center observational study of patients treated in medical and surgical intensive care units in Boston, Massa-chusetts. We studied 4,442 patients, age 18 years, who had chronic liver disease, received critical care between 1998 and 2012 and sur- vived hospitalization. The exposure of interest was RDW within 24 hours of hospital discharge and categorized a priori as13.3 %, 13.3-14.0 %, 14.0-14.7 %, 14.7-15.8 %, 15.8-17.0 % and >17.0 %. Theprimary outcome was all cause mortality in the 90 days following hospital discharge determined using the US Social Security Adminis- tration Death Master File. Adjusted odds ratios were estimated bymultivariable logistic regression models with inclusion of covariateterms for age, race, gender, Deyo-Charlson Index, patient type (med- ical versus surgical), sepsis and number of organs with acute failure. Results: The cohort patients were 62.6 % male, 21.4 % nonwhite and 35.7 % surgical. 14.9 % of the cohort had sepsis and the mean agewas 59 years. Mean(SD) MELD score was 15.0(8.0). 90-day post dis- charge mortality was 10.3 %. RDW at hospital discharge was a robust predictor of all cause post discharge mortality and remained so fol-lowing multivariable adjustment. Patients with a discharge RDW14.7-15.8 %, 15.8-17.0 % or >17.0 % have an adjusted OR of 90-day post discharge mortality of 2.31 (95%CI, < 0.001)relative to patients with a discharge RDW 13.3 %. Estimates were similar with additional adjustment for MELD score. Discharge RDW has moderate discrimination for 90-day post discharge mortality (AUC = 0.76; 95 % CI 0.74-0.78). Additionally, patients with a dis-charge RDW 15.8-17.0 % or >17.0 % have an adjusted OR of 30-dayreadmission of 1.60 (95%CI, 1.13-2.26) or 1.41 (95%CI, 1.01-1.98) rela- tive to a discharge RDW 13.3 %. Finally, patients with a discharge RDW 15.8-17.0 % or >17.0 % have an adjusted OR of care facilityplacement of 1.50 (95%CI, 1.11-2.02) or 1.45 (95%CI, discharge RDW 13.3 %. Conclusions: In CLD patients treated with critical care who survive hospitalization, an elevated RDW at discharge is a robust predictor ofsubsequent mortality, hospital readmission and placement in a carefacility. Increased RDW at discharge likely reflects the presence of o n g o i n gi n f l a m m a t i o no ro x i d a t i v es t r e s sw h i c hm a ye x p l a i nt h e observed impact on CLD patient outcomes following hospitaldischarge.

Ithas been suggested that in malnourished critically ill patients an early increased intake of calories and protein might improve their prognosis.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 391 of 607Objectives: To evaluate the impact of nutritional support, especially calories and protein, on specific outcomes - need of tracheostomy, ICU readmission, and intra-hospital mortality - in underweight critic-ally ill patients.Methods: Prospective, two-center, observational study, was designed to asses the effect of nutritional intake in underweight critically ill pa- tients. All patients consecutively admitted (November 2015 to March2016) to general intensive care units (ICU) with IMC < 20 kg/m 2were included. Exclusion criteria were: palliative care, exclusively oral nutri- tion, pregnancy, life expectancy < 24 h, and ICU readmission. Patients had their nutritional intake evaluated after ICU admission betweendays 2 and 3 (1stevaluation). Another evaluation was performed be- tween days 5 and 7 (2ndevaluation) if patient had not been dis- charged from ICU, was not on exclusively oral nutrition, or on palliative care. Patients were divided into groups according calorie in-take (group A:< 20 kcal/kg/day; group B: 20 kcal/kg/dia) and protein intake (group C:< 1 g protein/g/day; group D: 1 g protein/kg/day). Patients were followed in the hospital until their death or discharge. Results: The hospital mortality rate of 83 included patients was 55.4 % after 17 (10 -32) days of follow-up. There was an increment in calories (19.6 \u00b1 9.7 to \u00b1 27.6 \u00b1 11.2; p < protein p 27.5 \u00b1 11.9; p = 0.916) did not differ between survivors and no survivors; there was a trend for a higher protein intake (g/Kg/day) in survivors in the 1stevaluation (0.96 \u00b1 0.56 vs. 0.69 \u00b1 did not differ accord-ing caloric intake in the 1st(Table 79) and 2ndevaluation. Patients who received >1 g of protein/day (Group D) in the 1stevaluation (Table 79) had lower mortality than those who received less protein (Group C), but not in 2ndevaluation. Frequency of tracheostomies was higher in patients who received more calories (group B) and pro-tein(Group D) only in the 1stevaluation. Multivariate logistic models confirmed (OR, 95%CI) that protein intake was negatively associated with mortality [protein intake 0.43(0.18-0.99); SAPS3 1.07(1.02-1.11)]and with need of tracheotomy [protein intake 3.06(1.03-9.07); SAPS30.94(0.90-9.99)] even after adjustment for illness severity. ICU re- admission did not differ among groups. Conclusion: In underweight critically ill patients an early high protein intake at ICU admission has a protective role for mortality.Grant acknowledgement FIPE - HCPAA769 Quality indicators of nutritional therapy measured by dieticians may be associate with the outcome of the critical Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A769 Introduction: Nutritional risk and malnutrition must be screened at admission in intensive care units (ICU) because these patients usuallybenefit from early nutritional therapy1. Nutritional parameters should be monitored by quality indicators (QI), but their goals and associ- ation with patient outcome are still unknown. Objectives: To estimate the impact of malnutrition, nutritional risk and high caloric deficit on mortality at a 60 days follow-up in a gen-eral ICU population. Methods: Consecutive adult patients who remained in the ICU for greater then 48 hours were included and prospectively followed.Data were abstracted from electronic health records (EHR) by trainedICU dietitians on their sex, age, APACHE II and baseline nutrition as- sessment at admission 2. Daily nutrition information was collected on the type (i.e. EN, PN, oral, none) and amount of nutrition received(total calories) from ICU admission for a maximum of the first 7 days(EN only) unless death or discharge occurred sooner. Heavy caloric deficit occurred when < 25 % of the caloric needs was achieved in the first ICU week. Patients were followed while in hospital and theiroutcomes determined at 60 days after ICU admission. Online formswere elaborated to enter abstracted data with a secure web-based tool (GoogleDocs, \u00a9 2012). ResultsA total of 236 EHR were verify from 2014 to 2015 in 4 this audit,85.6 % were screened for Nutritional risk of that 91.1 % had nutri- tional risk according to NRS 2002 tool 2, 85.2 % were accessed with ASPEN-ADA3tool, diagnosing 23.4 % of malnutrition. 91.1 % of the EHR had information on the nutrients received, heavy caloric deficitwas verif in 27.4 % of the EHR with this information. Binary logistic regression evidenced risk of mortality at 60 days 8.01 times higher (95%CI 1.86 - 34.7, Wald = 7.8, p = 0.005) in patients malnourishedand with heavy caloric deficit in the first ICU week at the same timewhen compared with patients without these two risk factors (con- trolled by sex, age and APACHE II). Either malnutrition or heavy cal- oric deficit when present increases the mortality risk in 5.83 times(95%CI 1,33 - 25.4, Wald = 5.5, p = 0.019). Nutritional risk was not re-lated with mortality at 60 days. Conclusion: The QI presented are potentially useful nutritional markers and could implement ICU routine, the presence of a dietitianin the multidisciplinary team can facilitate that task. The combinationof malnutrition and heavy caloric deficit were relevant nutritional QI associated with ICU mortality regardless of sex, age and Apache II. More studies are needed to establish goals for these QI and to de-velop this field.

Segaran - Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, Adult Critical Care, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A770 Introduction: Enteral nutrition (EN) is currently the route of choice for feeding critically ill patients (1); however, due to the unpredict- able nature of critical illness, the delivery is frequently disrupted. Common reasons for inadequate delivery are gastrointestinal in- tolerance, fasting for diagnostic procedures, surgery and airway management (2). Cumulative calorie deficits contribute to malnu- trition (3) and poor outcome including increased infections, length of ICU /hospital stay and mortality (4). There is no recog- nised guidance on the length of time that should elapse between stopping EN and commencing anaesthetic procedures. We devel- oped and implemented our own fasting guidelines to address the EN interruptions on our units. In our trust, only radiologists or ICU consultants are allowed to confirm placement. We believe that this is negatively influencing tube confirmation times and contributing to EN under delivery. Objectives: To compare specific interruptions to EN in 3 different adult intensive care units (ICU), assessing impact on nutrition delivery\u00b7 /C15To examine compliance with ICU fasting guidelines on stopping and restarting enteral nutrition prior to operative and non-operative procedures Methods: An audit over 1 month in 3 adult different ICU's in a large London trust, each with its own unique specialities. Results: Data was collected on 59 patients. See Table 81for demographic details. The most frequent reasons for stopping EN were removal and confirmation of nasogastric tubes, extuba- tion and cancelations. Each was associated with an average def- icit of 800kcals and 35 g protein per episode. The nutritional deficits relating to each episode of fasting are detailed in Ta- bles 82and 83. Conclusions: Although the case mix was different, each unit expe- rienced frequent fasting impacting on enteral nutrition delivery. The reasons were similar for all units. Each fasting period was as- sociated with considerable calorie and protein deficit. Despite having ICU specific fasting guidelines in place, violations were ob- served for all procedures especially extubation and tracheostomy, where the fast far exceeded 4 hours. Restarting EN was also ex- tended waiting on NGT confirmation after the procedure. Pro- longed fasting and delays in restarting EN suggests limited appreciation of nutritional deficits and associated negative impact of fasting by ICU staff.Further education to our ICU staff is recom- mended on fasting guidance to increase awareness and compli- ance. In addition, the current practice for NGT confirmation should be reviewed with the view to allowing ICU trainees to confirm position following appropriate training. References 1. McClave S et al.

De Brito-Ashurst Royal Brompton and Harefield NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A771 Introduction: Diarrhoea is a common complication in patients receiv- ing enteral nutrition in the intensive care unit (ICU). International or- ganizations[1]'[2] recommend fibre-based formula to controldiarrhoea. Nevertheless, there are reported inconsistencies on thebenefits of fibre in reducing diarrhoea. [3] Furthermore, therecommended amount of fibre for the ICU patient group remains controversial. Objective: To establish the optimum amount of dietary fibre for regular bowel function in the ICU population.Methods: A retrospective review of all patients on ETF for > 5 days between January and December/2015. Inclusion criteria was ETF with fibre-based formula and exclusion was non-fibre ETF. Feeding for-mula contained mixed fibre with fructooligosaccharides. A quantita-tive score based on stool volume and consistency was used for daily assessment of diarrhoea; diarrhoea was defined as a score 15. [4] Patients were split into two groups: Group D (GD) - diarrhoea andGroup N (GN) - normal bowel function. Parametric tests were used toassess the difference between the mean faecal scores and fibre in- take of fibre between the groups. Results: Two hundred and fifty one patients fitted the inclusion criteria. Patients were male (153/251) and age 54 \u00b1 17 years. Dataare presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). Faecal scores were 9.9 (1.6) and 17.4 (1.8) (P < 0.001) for GN (216/251) and GD (35/251) on GDat 21.64 g/day (7.2) compared to GN at 11.8 (6.6) (P < 0.002).Flatulence and abdominal pain was only reported in the group D, on patients with a fibre intake >25 g/day. Nutritional intake was similar for both groups that received >75 % of caloric and pro-tein prescription. Both groups were on prokinectics; GD was onmetoclopramide (36) and erythromycin 39/6 for both prokinectics. Conclusion: Fibre intake has an impact on bowel function. A high fibre intake is associated with diarrhoea and flatulence. The higherrate of flatulence is likely to result from fermentation of the soluble fibre in the colon. The optimum fibre intake for the ICU group is < 20 g/day. References [1] Kreymann, K.G., et McClave SA, Taylor BE, Martindale RG, et al.

Patients in the fish oil cohort (n 14) received n-3 PUFAs-enriched PN and patients in the standard PN cohort (n 10), a MCT/LCT lipid emulsion. Baseline charac-teristics of patients, energy and fat intake, laboratory parameters (in-cluding liver function tests), new infections, insulin requirements, days on mechanical ventilation, length of ICU and hospital stay and mortality were recorded. Significance level was defined at a p valueof less than 0.05.Results: B oth groups had similar baseline characteristics : age (63 \u00b1 17 vs 63 \u00b1 12), Apache II (18 \u00b1 6 vs 18 \u00b1 7), SAPS 3 (66 \u00b1 12 vs 61 \u00b1 15), prealbumin at admission (11 mg/dl \u00b1 10 vs 9 \u00b1 6). The variableresults are shown in Tables 84and 85. Conclusions: The use of a fish oil based emulsion in PN had no effect on new infections, insulin requirements, hospital length of stay and hospital mortality when compared with MCT/LCT basedemulsion in ICU patients with Apache II score > 17. Bilirubin con-centrations and ICU length of stay were lower in the MCT/LCT group. There is also a non-significant trend toward less ventilator- days per patient in the MCT/LCT group. More strong evidence isrequired before giving a recommendation on lipid emulsions incritically ill patients requiring PN. References 1. Grau-Carmona T, Bonet-Saris A, Garc\u00eda-de-Lorenzo A, et al.

GRIP - Karolinska University Hospital / Karolinska Institutet, Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care, Huddinge,Sweden Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A773Introduction: In metabolic ICU research it is often desirable to measure local blood flow to quantify production/utilization of various substrates. The gold standard is to do this through dilution techniques of e.g. coldwater or dye. These methods are however invasive and may cause painor risk of injury of the patient. It is therefore desirable to use noninva- sive techniques, such as Strain Gauge Venous Occlusion Plethysmogra- phy (SGVOP) and Doppler Ultra Sound (DUS). Both of these are usedtoday but they measure blood flow through different principles andgives results in different units. These methods have previously been compared in healthy subjects but never in ICU Patients. Objectives: We wanted to investigate the correlation between SGVOP and DUS and how they are able to detect changes in bloodflow in ICU patients. Methods: ICU patients (n = 10) with an expected stay of >24 hours were recruited after informed consent. All patients underwent simultan-eous blood flow measurements of both legs at two separate timepoints (5 -26 hours) and medical data was collected from charts. SGVOP was performed on the left side with the cuff placed on the medial thigh and a strain gauge placed on the thickest part of the calf, which washanging free as the foot was supported by pillows. Blood flow was esti-mated as a mean of five measurements. DUS was performed on the right leg by measuring the diameter of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) thrice and assess blood flow was at angle >60 0as a mean of five heart strokes. A mean of three such measurements was calculated.Results: The mean values at the two time points were 36.3 \u00b1 27.4 and 28.6 \u00b1 21.0 ml x min1x 100 ml tissue1(with 10 % variability) for SGVOP and for DUS 189 \u00b1 126 and 128 \u00b1 60 ml/min (7.7 % vari-ability). The rvalue for comparison between the methods in all mea- surements was 0.684 (p < 0.001) and for the change in blood flow between the time points 0.423 (p = 0.223). However 3 patients had higher doses of noradrenaline (>0.075 g/kg/min) and changes in noradrenaline between the time points. When these were excludedfrom the analysis, the rvalue for the remaining 7 patients were 0.710 (p = 0.004) for all measurements and 0.913 (p = 0.004) to assess the change between time points.Conclusions: SGVOP measures blood flow in the lower leg and does not correlate exactly with DUS of SFA. The methods however correl- ate fairly good and approximates changes in blood flow very good in stable hemodynamic conditions, similarly as in previous studies inhealthy subjects, but fails to do so in situations with higher dosesand changes in noradrenaline. This might be because noradrenaline alters the portion of blood going to skin and muscle respectively. A774 Lung damage in systemic sclerodermamBen Naser, F. Jaziri, A. M. El Euch,M. Abdelghni, Abdallah, - Charles Nicolles Hospital, Systemic Disease, Tunis, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A774 Introduction: The Diffuse infiltrative lung disease (PID) is a relatively common complication of Scleroderma (ScS) and its evolution is highly variable and difficult to predict.Patients and methods: It is a retrospective study including 54 files of patients with a systemic Scleroderma and followed up by our service, for a period of 29 years from January 1985 until December 2013. The diagnosis of CBS has been selected according to the criteria of theACR as defined in 1980.Results: Lung damage was objectified in 35 patients (64, 81 %), 28 women and 7 men, middle-aged 39.96 years \u00b1 14.96. The average timeappearance of lung damage was 34, 20 \u00b1 27, 31 months. Lungdamage was revealed by a Dyspnea on exertion in 20 cases(37.03 %) associated with a dry cough in 18 (33.33 %). Lung damage was asymptomatic in 10 cases (14.41 %).Chest x-ray performed in all patients was normal in 25 cases (46.30 %). She showed reticularopacities in 9 patients (16.67 %), reticulonodularin 15 cases (27.77 %)and honeycomb images in 5 cases (9.26 %).

C\u00e1novas - Morales Meseguer Hospital, Murcia, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl Mortality of cirrhotic patients cations is high due to associated comorbidities. For these reasons it is important to individualize each case in severity and severity of the cause of ICU admission. Objectives: To analyze the ability of differents severity indexes (both general and specific) in predicting hospital and annual mortality of liver cirrhosis patients admitted to an Intensive Care Unit. Methods: Retrospective observational study on a prospective data- base of 10 years duration. All patients were admitted consecutively with primary or secondary diagnosis of cirrhosis. The mortality pre- diction is performed by constructing ROC curves calculating the area under the curve (AUC) with confidence intervals at 95 % (95 % CI). Results: 229 patients were analyzed (mean age 58.6 \u00b1 13.1 years, and 78.6 % males) . The APACHE II index admission was 25 \u00b1 10 SAPS II 49 \u00b1 21 and 21 \u00b1 MELD index 9. The SOFA rate and maximum income was 7 \u00b1 4 and 11 \u00b1 4, respectively. Hospital mortality and the year was 47.6 % and 60.7 % respectively. ABC and 95 % CI for hospital mortality and per year is presented in Table 86. ABC. Conclusions: Cirrhotic patients admitted to ICU have a high mortality. The severity indexes both general and the specific MELD cirrhosis well predict hospital mortality. However, that best mortality predictor is the maximum SOFA index, with high capacity to predict mortality per year.

Szczeklik - Jagiellonian University Medical College, IInd Department of Internal Medicine, Krak\u00f3w, Poland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A776 Introduction: Autoimmune diseases are s ignificant challenge for Intensive Care physicians. They are often complicated by multiple-organ dysfunction and side effects of long-term im- munosuppressive therapy. Moreover, treatment of infections is particularly difficult concerni ng constant immunosuppression. Primary systemic vasculitides (PSV) are subgroup of autoimmune diseases associated with especially problematic clinical course often complicated by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage leading to re- spiratory failure. Objectives: The aim of the study was to compare patients suffering from systemic autoimmune diseases with those suffering from pri- mary systemic vasculitides in terms of clinical condition severity on admission, treatment requirements and in-hospital mortality in ICU setting. Methods: Medical records of 74 patients with systemic autoimmune diseases (SAD) including primary systemic vasculitides admitted to Intensive Care Unit of the Jagiellonian University Medical College, Krakow, Poland between 2001 and 2014 were analyzed in terms of demographic, clinical and laboratory data. Severity of patients' clin- ical condition was assessed using SAPS II, SAPS III, APACHE II, APA- CHE III and SOFA scales. Results: Demographic and clinical data are presented in Fig. 114. 23 patients with PSV and 51 patients with SAD were enrolled in the study. Patients with PSV had significantly higher scores in SAPS II, APACHE II and SOFA scales and required mechanical ven- tilation (87,0 % vs 64,7 %, p = 0,04), renal replacement therapy (69,6 % vs 21,6 %, p < 0,001) and blood products transfusions (78,3 % vs 49,0 %, p = 0,02) more often than patients with SAD. Also mortality was significantly higher among PSV group (60,9 % vs 35,3 %, p = 0,04). Conclusions: Patients with PSV treated in the ICU are in more severe condition, require more complex intensive therapy and have poorer prognosis than patients with other SAD.

Ben Jazia - Charles Nicolles Hospital, Systemic Disease, Tunis, Tunisia Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A777 Introduction: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a common clinical situ- ation causing morbidity and an important mortality . Because it canbe a complicated pulmonary embolism can be life-threatening. Objectives: Our goal is to study clinical features, Para clinical and scalable DVT complicated pulmonary embolism (DVT/PE).Materials. And methods: We conducted a retrospective and descrip- tive study of the records of patients hospitalized for DVT/PE in the service of internal medicine, CHU Charles NICOLLES over a period of 30 years (1985 -2015). We compared the patients with a DVT/PE (Group 1 G1) versus those who did not have pulmonary embolismcomplicating PST (Group 2 G2). Results: We collected 120 cases of DVT. The mean age of patients was 41.76 ans [15 -78]. The DVT/PE (Group1 G1) were observed in 28 patients either in 23.33 % of cases.. It was 14 women and 14 men.DVT non complicated with pulmonary embolism (Group 2 G2) were observed among 92 patients (76.66 %) . It was 36 women and 56 men. Elderly patients were significantly fewer in the group G1 (3 pa-tients) versus 10 older subjects in the Group G2 (p = 0.01). Regardingthrombotic risk factors, there was no significant difference between the 2 groups. The frequency of recurrence weren't similar between the 2 groups: 3 in the group G1 and 26 in the Group G2. There werealso significant etiological difference between the 2 groups. Indeed,neoplasia was observed in 2 patients group G1 and 9 patients in Group G2 (p = 0.02). Thrombophilia, Becket's disease,Lupus and hy- perhomocyst\u00e9inemia are kept respectively in 2,2,2 and 0 for patientsof Group G 1 versus 6,24,3 and 4 patients of the Group G2. The causeof the DVT was idiopathic 17(60) patients of the group and51(55) of the Group G2 (p =0.6). Conclusions: Pulmonary embolism is a common and serious compli- cation that can jeopardize the vital prognosis of the patient wherethe interests of well know the risk factors predisposing to this complication. Outcome analysis II A778 The sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA) as a surrogate endpoint for mortality in randomized controlled trials, Netherlands;2Centre Hospitalier Universitaire de FranceCorrespondence: H.-J. de Grooth - VU University Medical Center, Department of Intensive Care, Amsterdam, Netherlands Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A778 Introduction: The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA) is increasingly used as a surrogate endpoint in intensive care Ran- domized Controlled Trials (RCTs). Serially measured SOFA is inde-pendently associated with mortality in observational cohorts [1], butthe association between RCT treatment effects on SOFA vs. mortality has not yet been quantified. It is currently unclear which SOFA ab- straction is the most responsive and consistent surrogate endpoint for mortality in RCTs.Objectives: Using study-level data from published RCTs that re- port both SOFA and mortality, our objective was to quantify the relation between SOFA endpoints and mortality and to identifywhich SOFA abstraction best reflects between-group mortalitydifferences. Methods: RCTs in adult intensive care patients reporting both SOFA and mortality endpoints were identified using a PubMedand Embase query. Reported SOFA abstractions were classifiedasearly, late and delta according to the definition used to com- pute the SOFA endpoint (Table 87). Treatment effects on SOFA were calculated as the between-g roup SOFA standardized differ- ence. Treatment effects on mortality were calculated as log oddsratio (OR) of treatment vs. control group mortality. We used random-effects meta-regression to: (i) quantify the linear relationship between RCT effects on mortality (logOR)and SOFA; (ii) quantify residual heterogeneity (expressed as I 2 and tau). The review protocol was prospectively registered (CRD42016034014). Results: Data from 87 studies were included in the analysis (Fig. 115). Fifty-five studies used Early-SOFA, 32 studies used Late-SOFA and 25 studies used Delta-SOFA as an endpoint. Stud-ies reporting different SOFA abstractions had comparable charac-teristics regarding sample size, year of publication and study population. Between-group differences in Early-SOFA and Late-SOFA were notsignificantly associated with between-group differences in mortality(slope = 0.40 (SE 0.21), p = 0.116 and Slope = 0.18 (SE 0.25), p = 0.457, respectively), but difference in Delta-SOFA was (slope = 0.70 (SE 0.22), p = 0.005) (Fig. 116). The heterogeneity of the association was lowest for Delta-SOFA (I 2= 0 % vs. 14 % and 13 %, p < 0.01 against both using F-test on tau2). Conclusions: Time-fixed Early- and Late-SOFA were the most fre- quently reported outcome measures among the reviewed RCTs.However, based on study level data aggregated in this systematic re- view, Delta-SOFA appears to be the most responsive and consistent surrogate endpoint for mortality.

Therefore, only very few information is available on theirprognosis.Objectives: To evaluate the clinical characteristics and outcome of critically ill patients > =90 years old and compared with those be- tween 70 and 79 years old.Methods: Retrospective analysis of administrative data of patients admit- ted between 1/1/2009 and 31/12/2013 to an ICU of a regional hospital. Results: Over 5 years, 109 patients aged 90 years old were admitted (1.4 % total ICU admission). Their median age was 92 and predomin-antly female (62.4 %). The majority of patients (96.3 %) were emer-gency admission with 36.7 % for postoperative care. Compared with those aged 70 -79, those aged > =90 years old had similar prevalence of comorbidities (except metastatic carcinoma), comparable chanceto receive mechanical ventilation but less likely to have renal replace-ment therapy (RRT) (16.2 % vs. 4.6 %). Despite having similar disease severity as assessed by Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) IV minus age score, they have higher ICU, hospital, 90-day,180-day and 2-year mortality. After adjustment of disease severity, co-morbidities and the use of RRT, their 2-year mortality differed by 1.9 times. Around 60 % of patients aged > =90 years old could be dis- charged home but only 41.3 % survived 2 years after ICU admission.Conclusions: Despite the fact that two-third of them could be dis- charged home following treatment in ICU, only around 40 % survived 2 years from ICU admission. These findings provided useful informa- tion for ICU triage purpose. A780 Admission of critical octogenarian patients to intensive care (ICU).Short and long term results J. Gonzalez Londo\u00f1o, C. Lorencio Cardenas, M. Morales Pedrosa, Correspondence: J. Gonzalez Londo\u00f1o - Dr Josep Trueta University Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, Girona, Spain Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A780 Objectives: The ICU admission of patients over 80 years of age has been questioned because of the high mortality and low life expect- ancy of these patients. However, with the growing increase of the lifeexpectancy of the population together with the improvement ofdiagnostic and therapeutic techniques, more and more, age is not a limiting factor for ICU admission. Our goal is to analyze the short and long term the morbidity and mortality of octogenarian patients ad-mitted to the ICU, as well as functional status after ICU discharge.Materials and methods: Retrospective observational study in which all patients over 80 years old admitted to a polyvalent ICU of a ter- tiary hospital during the years 2012 -2014 were included. Demo- graphic variables, severity indices (APACHE II), initial lactate, mortalityand length of stay were registered. Patients were followed during one year after ICU discharge. 6 months and one year mortality as well as the value of the Karnofsky scale after 1 year of dischargewere registered.Results: During the study period, 178 octogenarian patients were in- cluded [2012 = 52 (29.2 %); 2013 = 62 (34.8 %) and 2014 = 64 (36 %)]. 56.7 % were male with a median age of 82.7 years of age (\u00b12.4) andan APACHE II of 21.8 (\u00b17.1). The initial lactate was 25.1 mg/dL (\u00b122).Reasons for admission were non-respiratory sepsis (38.8 %), post- operative cardiac surgery (16.9 %), cardiac arrest (5.6 %), polytrauma (4.5 %), pneumonia (4.5 %), and cerebral hemorrhage (3.9 %). Theaverage intake was 6.7dies (\u00b17.7) in the ICU and 17.7dies (\u00b115) in thehospital. ICU mortality was 30.3 % and hospital mortality was 41 %. Mortality at 6 months of discharge from ICU was 48.3 % and at one year of discharge 51.1 %. The Karnofsky scale after one year of ICUdischarge was 73.2 (\u00b116.2).The mortality for octogenarian patients was 10 % higher than the global mortality of ICU admitted patients during the same period (30.3 % vs. 21 %). Both the initial APACHE II and lactate weresignificantly higher in patients eventually died (20.4 \u00b1 6.3 vs 25.3 \u00b1 7.8; p < 7.20 vs 12:05 \u00b1 30.8 and 22.7 \u00b1 24, p < 0.05). ICU mortality was significantly higher in patients with pneumonia (75 %). However,mortality was significantly lower in postoperative cardiac surgery(6.7 %; p < 0.05). Conclusions: The number of octogenarian patients admitted to ICUs has been increasing in recent years. Mortality in patientsover 80 years of age admitted to our ICU is higher than theoverall mortality of our ICU. However, it varies significantly de- pending on the diagnosis. The initial lactate and APACHE II are also prognostic in this group of patients. The mortality of octoge-narians patients admitted to our ICU reaches the 50 % after oneyear of discharge, and those who survive cannot perform a nor- mal daily activity. A781 Outcomes of patients admitted to intensive care unit with acute variceal haemorrhageK. Wykes, J. Jack, P. MorganEast Surrey Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, London, UK Correspondence: K. Wykes - East Surrey Hospital, Intensive Care Unit, London, UK Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): Care Unit (ICU) is associated with significant mortality.[1]Objectives: To compare outcomes and factors associated with hos- pital mortality (HM) in patients admitted with AVH to a busy district general hospital ICU. Methods: A retrospective study of adult patients (N = 82) admitted to ICU with a primary admission diagnosis of AVH from 1993 -2016 was performed by searching the electronic medical records database. We applied statistical analysis (Pearson chi-square) to assess the differ- ences in outcomes for patients receiving different interventions.Results: The median age of our patient population was 56.3 years, 62 % were male, and there were 8 transfers to tertiary centres. The percentage HM for patients admitted to ICU with a variceal bleed was found to be 43 %, with mortality rising to 59 % if thatpatient was intubated and ventilated, and 92 % if that patient re-ceived inotropic support during their admission. Inotropic support (OR, 11.9; 95 % CI, 1.5 to 97.3; chi-square 7.9 P = 0.0048) and an APACHEII score above 40 (OR, 3.98; 95 % CI, 1.0-15.5; chi-square4.4 P = 0.0459) were both significant independent predictors formortality. Intubation and ventilation alone was not a significant mortality predictor. Conclusions: A patient presenting to ICU with an AVH is predicted to have a significantly worse outcome if they are commenced on ino-tropic support, with mortality rising to 92 % from 43 %. Intubation and ventilation alone was not a significant predictor of a worse out- come. This result should prompt a consideration of outcomes whenstarting inotropic support in a patient on ICU who presents with avariceal bleed.

Mukhopadhyay - National University Health System, Singapore, Singapore Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A782 Introduction: Loss of muscle mass in critically ill patients admitted to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) is common1and contributes to ICU ac- quired weakness. Loss of rectus femoris muscle has been shown to be related to length of stay in ICU2; however previous studies have not investigated the relationship between mortality and muscle loss. Objectives: To seek an association between muscle loss and 28-day mortality in medical ICU (MICU) patients and compare rates of muscle loss in patients dead or alive at 28-day. Methods: This was an observational study in the MICU of a university affiliated academic medical centre. Serial measurements of rectus femoris thickness (RFT) by ultrasound were performed on admission, day 3,7 and 10.Other parameters including demographics, body mass index (BMI), Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APA- CHE II) and Charlson co-morbidly index were collected. Analysis was performed with a generalised linear mixed model. Results: We included 45 patients (65 % male, mean age 63 \u00b1 11 years, mean BMI 25.2 \u00b1 4.8 kg/m2, mean APACHE II score 28 \u00b1 8),median (IQR) ICU and hospital stay of 6(3 -10) and 14(5 -55) days respectively with a 24.4 % 28-day mortality.Both patient group lost significant muscle thickness (mean loss of right RFT, day 3: 7.9 \u00b1 7 %,day 10: 11.3 \u00b1 9 %, p < 0.001) from 0 -10 days but no difference was ob- served between the groups (p = 0.45).Loss of RFT was significantly as- sociated with length of stay in the hospital (p = 0.048,R2= 0.1).Each 1 % loss in the RFT was associated with 28 % increased relative risk for mortality (p < 0.001,OR 1.28,95 % CI 1.14-1.45). Conclusions: Critically ill patients uniformly lose muscle during their hospital stay and muscle loss was significantly associated with 28- day mortality. References 1.

In these settings, intensive care medicine is challenged by delicate resource restrictions which are likely to affect patient outcome (2). Objective: To evaluate the epidemiology and outcome of critical ill- ness in Mongolia, a lower-middle income country in Central Asia. Methods: In this prospective observational study, demographic, clin- ical and outcome data of all critically ill patients admitted to the in- tensive care units (ICU) of five tertiary university teaching hospitals Fig. 117 (abstract A782). Loss of Rectus Femoris Dead vs AliveIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 400 of 607and five secondary hospitals in the capital city of Ulaanbaatar as well as nine secondary province hospitals were collected during a six month period in 2014/15. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Mongolian Medical University. Results: During the observation period, 2,032 patients (53.6 % male) with a median age of 49 years (interquartile range, 36 -62 years) were admitted to the study ICUs. The ten most frequent ICU admission diagnoses were stroke (ischemic and hemorrhagic) (n = 354; 17.4 %), decompensated liver cirrhosis (n = 187; 9.2 %), acute or acute-on- chronic heart failure (n = 182; 9 %), infection (n = 169; 8.3 %), trauma (n = 153; 7.5 %), traumatic brain injury (n = 145; 7.1 %), acute abdo- men (n = 143; 7 %), pre-eclampsia/eclampsia (n = 117; 5.8 %), acute or acute-on-chronic renal failure (n = 80; 3.9 %) and postoperative care following elective and emergency surgery (n = 66; 3.2 %). 100 %, 31.7 % and 13 % of patients had access to mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and invasive hemodynamic monitoring, respectively. ICU mortality was 23.5 % in the total population and 26.6 % when maternal cases were excluded. Multiple organ dysfunc- tion syndrome (38.1 %), coma (36.6 %) and shock (15.6 %) were the three most common causes of death. The five ICU admission diagno- ses with the highest case fatality rate were lung tuberculosis (51.9 %), traumatic brain injury (42.1 %), decompensated liver cirrho- sis (33.7 %), stroke (31.9 %) and infection (30.8 %). The five ICU ad- mission diagnoses causing most death cases were stroke (n = 113), decompensated liver cirrhosis (n = 63), traumatic brain injury (n = 61), infection (n = 52) and acute abdomen (n = 38). Conclusions: Critical illness in Mongolia affects younger patients than reported from high-income countries. ICU admission diagnoses are similar with a particularly high incidence of stroke and decompen- sated liver cirrhosis. Total ICU mortality is approximately 25 % with most ICU deaths caused by stroke, decompensated liver cirrhosis and traumatic brain injury.

A784 Association of hypochloremia with A784 Introduction: Chloride alterations play a major physiologic role in the development of acid -base disorders. Most of the studies related to abnormalities in chloride concentration have been focused on the hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Although hypochloremic meta- bolic alkalosis has been suggested as a predictor of mortality, this issue remains insufficiently studied. Objective: To assess the prognostic value of hypochloremia in a large cohort of critically ill patients. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective observational study that included all patients admitted at the ICU between 2007 and 2015. Chloride serum concentration adjusted to blood sodium level, acid -base status, routine laboratory, and clinical variables were measured at admission. The primary outcome was defined as the all- cause hospital death according to quintiles of serum chloride levels. We performed a multivariate logistic regression, in which quintiles of chloride levels were analyzed as dummy variables. Results: We included 4898 patients. APACHE II score was 13 \u00b1 7. Hos- pital mortality was 12 %. Fig. 118 shows the hospital mortality in the different quintiles of chloride concentration. In the multivariate analysis, the quintile of chloride concentration of 99 \u00b1 3 mEq/L was independently associated with a worse outcome(OR = 2.00, 95 % CI = 1.46-2.76, P= 0.001) after adjusting to APACHE II score, vasopressor requirements, mechanical ventilation, and lactate levels. Conclusions: In this large series of critically ill patients, the presence of hypochloremia at ICU admission was an independent predictor of mortality. In contrast, hyperchloremia was not associated with in- creased mortality. A785 Long-term outcomes post CRRT in an Irish ICU setting D. Greaney1, A. Magee1, G. Fitzpatrick2 1AMNCH, Critical Care, Dublin, Ireland;2AMNCH, Dublin, Ireland Correspondence: D. Greaney - AMNCH, Critical Care, Dublin, Ireland Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A785 Introduction: Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) is com- monly employed in ICU for patients with acute kidney injury and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, renal outcomes at in the longer term are not widely described in the litera- ture and have never been described in Ireland. Objectives: We analysed all patients admitted to our tertiary ICU who were commenced on CRRT over a 2 year period. Our primary aim was to calculate the mortality of this cohort and estimate the likelihood of survivors requiring long-term dialysis. Our secondary aim was to analyse the characteristics of those requiring long-term dialysis. Method: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients requiring CRRT admitted to our ICU between 2013 and 2015. From the Clinical Information System, we analysed patient age, sex, diag- nosis, illness severity scores, pre-CRRT creatinine levels, AKIN scores, length of CRRT and ICU admission. Survivors with new onset renal failure were followed up at 6 and 12 months to determine survival, dialysis dependency and serum creatinine level. This study received ethical committee waiver. Results: Of 686 ICU admissions, 202 patients (29.4 %) received CRRT. 50 % of these patients died prior to hospital discharge. 85 patients had new onset renal failure and survived to hospital discharge. The 5 patients dialysed for toxin removal were excluded from further ana- lysis. 11 patients (13.8 %) required ongoing CRRT at hospital dis- charge whereas 69 patients (86.2 %) did not. Of those requiring ongoing CRRT, 1 patient had died at 6 months, 2 further patients had died at 12 months, and 1 patient was lost to follow-up. Of the remaining 7 patients, 4 (57 %) were dialysis dependent at 12 months. Of the 69 patients who did not require RRT at hospital discharge, 12 had died at 6 months and 3 further patients had died at 12 month follow-up. 4 patients were lost to follow-up and a further 5 patients Fig. 118 (abstract A784).Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 401 of 607did not have blood results available. Of the remaining 45 patients, 100 % were not dialysis dependent at 12 months. Conclusions: The mortality rate for patients admitted to ICU and commenced on CRRT in our cohort was consistent with that in theinternational literature. The likelihood of requiring long-term dialysis for survivors was similarly consistent. This novel information is of value in the management and prognostication of patients requiringCRRT in an Irish ICU setting. References 1.

A786 Predictive value of serum estradiol de Especialidades, Centro M\u00e9dico La Raza, IMSS, Intensive Care Unit, Mexico, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A786 Introduction: During acute illness, the risk of death depends mainly on the severity of the disease, the previous health status of the pa-tient, and how he (she) responds to injury or disease. In the last dec- ade, several studies have evaluated the impact of sex on mortality of patients with different acute problems and they have found that hor-mones may be a factor that also influences the outcome of criticallyill patients. Objective: To evaluate the capacity of serum estradiol levels to pre- dict mortality in critically ill patients.Patients and methods: A prospective study was performed in critic- ally ill patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). Serum estra- diol level was measured at admission to the ICU, its discriminative capacity to predict mortality was determined by analysis of the re-ceiver operative characteristics (ROC) curve, and its association withmortality by logistic regression analysis. A p value < 0.05 was consid- ered statistically significant. Results: We included 131 patients with a mean age of 48.9 years, 57.3 % men. The serum estradiol was non-survivors com-pared with survivors: 116 vs 67.2 pg/mL, respectively (p < 0.0001). The area under the ROC curve of serum estradiol to predict mortality was 0.74 serum estradiol >97.9 pg/mL had sensitiv-ity 60 %, specificity 90 %, positive predictive value 64 %, negativepredictive value 88 %, positive likelihood 6, and negative likelihood 0.44 to identify mortality. In the multivariate analysis, it had OR of 6.47 (p = 0.002) for ICU mortality.Conclusions: Serum estradiol is elevated in critically ill patients, espe- cially in those who die, it has good discriminative ability for mortality and is an independent risk factor for death in this group of patients.

A787 The effects of secondhand smoke on outcomes in ICU after scoliosis surgery M.S. Aydogan, T. TogalInonu University, Intensive Care, T. Togal - Inonu University, Intensive Care, Malatya, Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A787 Introduction: Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure is harmful and a major problem worldwide that is associated with ill health and mor- tality (1,2).Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate the associ- ation between exposure to secondhand smoke (SHS) on outcomes in intensive care unit (ICU) after scoliosis surgery. Methods: This prospective observational study was conducted in 103 pa- tients, 12 -18 years, with idiopathic scoliosis for elective posterior spinal fusion. All patients underwent stand ard total intravenous anesthesia and epidural morphine with PCA. Quality of pain relief and sedation were assessed using the Numeric Visual Analog Scale (NVAS), Richmond Agita-tion Sedation Scale (RASS). The patients were divided into three groups:Group S; consisted of smokers, Group SHS; consisted of exposure smokers, and Group NS; consisted of individuals who did not have any history of smoking and were not exposed to smoke. Information was re-ported in questionnaires and took blood samples for analysis of serumcotinine obtained at the time of study enrollment. Demographic and clin- ical characteristics included morphine usage, blood transfusion, duration of mechanical ventilator support and length of ICU stay were recorded.Results: The patient characteristics did not differ between the groups. There was a statistically significant difference among groups in terms of serum cotinine levels. There were no significant differ- ences in NVAS and RASS scores between the groups. The HR andMAP were not differ between the three groups of patients at all theevaluation time. Morphine consumption was significantly less in Group SHS compared with that of Group S at all time points (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences regarding the number oftransfused blood units between the three groups of patients. Dur-ation of MV support was significantly higher in group SHS than inIntensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 402 of 607group S (P < 0.05). The median length of ICU stay was significantly longer in group SHS than in group S (P < 0.05). The occurrence of pneumonia in this population was also similar between the threegroups of patients. there were no significant differences between thegroups with regard to postoperative side effects. Conclusions: We found that SHS was associated with increased length of ICU stay compared to nonsmokers among scoliosis surgerypatient. We concluded that it is important to avoid SHS before at ICUadmission when possible. References 1 -Homa DM, Neff LJ, King BA, Caraballo RS, Bunnell RE, Babb SD, et al.

Taha 1, Hospital, Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Singapore, Singapore;2Changi General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore Correspondence: A. Taha - Changi General Hospital, Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Singapore, Singapore Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A788 Introduction: Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 20 - 50 % in pa- tients with severe sepsis, with more than half of these patients need- ing continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT)1. The mortality among the patients needing CRRT generally exceeds 60 %2,3. Objectives: To evaluate the outcome of patients in the medical in- tensive care unit (MICU) with a diagnosis of severe sepsis with AKI and who required CRRT.Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients admitted to Changi General Hospital MICU with a diagnosis of severe sepsis with AKI who required CRRT from June 2013 to January 2015. Results: A total of 213 patients were screened and 33 were excluded because of incomplete data. One hundred and eighty patient recordswere analyzed. Of these, 105 (58.3 %) were male. The mean APACHE II score was 28.13 \u00b1 9.64. The median length of MICU stay was 3 days (interquartile range 1 -7) and median hospital length of stay was 16 days (interquartile range 9 -33). The median duration of dialysis was 1 day (interquartile range 1 -2). The MICU mortality was 38.9 % and hospital mortality was 39.4 %. Conclusions: Mortality rates in our study were lower than what is previously stated in the literature. It may be worthwhile to conduct amulticentre study which includes other institutions in Singapore. References 1. Rangel-Frausto MS, Pittet D, Costigan M, Hwang T, Davis CS, Wenzel RP.

This poster compares thepathways experienced by two groups of patients with Brain Injuries(Traumatic vs Hypoxic) with the intention of influencing future plan- ning strategies. Objectives /C15To identify the number of admissions and length of stay (LOS)in Critical Care/On the ward of patients with TBI/HBI; /C15To identify the hospital discharge destination of survivorsfollowing TBI/HBI, where discharge home was not possible; /C15Review of currents pathways for on-going management of TBI/HBI patients following cessation of acute care. Methods: Retrospective analysis of data collected via Ward Watcher software (Critical Care Audit Ltd) of all TBI/HBI admissions to the Adult Critical Care Directorate of a large London teaching hospitalbetween 01/01/2011 up to the 20/03/2016.Results: Between 01/01/2011 and 20/03/2016, 205 patients were ad- mitted to Adult Critical Care with TBI, versus 41 patients with HBI. The average LOS in Adult Critical Care units for patients suffering TBIis 9.7 days versus 23.4 days following HBI. Following Critical Care dis-charge, hospital (ward) stay is 29.9 days for TBI patients and 48.9 days for HBI patients. TBI patients Adult Critical Care Stay during this period was 1980 daysversus 938 days for patients with HBI. Following discharge from thisLondon teaching hospital, those patients unsuitable for discharge home received on-going care in other 'centres' . Centre discharged to /C15TBI19 % Rehabilitation Centres, 78 % Other Hospitals, 20 % Nursing Home. /C15HBI 19 % Rehabilitation Centres, 51 % Other Hospitals, 20%Other Hospitals,10 % Still awaiting discharge. Analysis of care provision for these patients identified a clear structure and pathway for patients with TBI, supported by a mul- tiprofessional team with structured, frequent patient reviews. In comparison, patients with HBI had no clear pathway or reviewfrequency, although were supported by several therapeuticdisciplines. Conclusion: It is clear that patients experiencing severe Brain Injury (regardless of type) do experience prolonged hospital stays and un-certain recovery pathways. Although larger in number, patients withHBI tend to occupy both Critical Care and Ward Beds for lengthier periods than patients with TBI. This may lead to delays in accessing appropriate ongoing care and/or inappropriate use of resources inspecialised hospital beds.Further work is needed to unpick the layers of consistency in service provision for both groups.Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1):30 Page 403 of 607A790 Studying mortality in critically ill patients - what does it teach us? S. Castro1, T. Pires2, 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A790 Introduction: Mortality in critically ill patients is high either while in the ICU but also after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).The mortality rate must be understood and integrated into the hos-pital reality where the ICU is inserted. Objectives: In the present study we aim to understand factors associ- ated with ICU and hospital mortality and the trajectories and burdenof functional limitations of ICU survivors.Methods: Mortality was characterized at the time of discharge from ICU, in the first 48 hours of ICU and after ICU. Studied variables in- cluded type of admission (scheduled surgery, urgent surgery, medicaland trauma), age, gender, SAPS II, main diagnosis, median length ofstay (LS) before ICU, in ICU and after ICU. Student test was performed to compare continuous values and chi- square for categorical variables. Man-Whitney Utest was performed to study continuous variables nonparametric. Statistical significancewas defined as p-values less than 0,05. Results: A total of 446 patients were discharged from ICU in 2015. 118 (26.45 %) died in the ICU. 38 (8.5 %) patients died in the remain-der time of their hospitalization. Hospital mortality was 34.9 %. Ofthe patients who died in the ICU, 59 (50 %) died in the first 48 hours. Of the patients who died from septic shock, 36 were medical and 35 urgent surgical.Septic shock was the main cause of death in medical and, in particular,in urgent surgical population. Medical patients had a early ICU mortality (<48 h) that was higher than in surgical patients. Higher age and higher severity of disease was also associated with higher mortality. Mortalitywas significantly higher in those patients who had a longer lenght ofstay in hospital before ICU admission (Table 88). Those who died after ICU had a me dian lenght of stay in hospital of 49 days; of these, a median of 8 days were spent in the ICU, a median of13 days were spent in the ward before ICU admission and a median of28 days were spent after ICU discharge until death occurs in the ward. Conclusions: The perception of the conditions under which death occurs can help to rethink the organization of the critical patient cir-cuit in the hospital, in particular to prompt earlier ICU admissionsand to adress more aproppriately those patients who might or not benefit from ICU admission.

Taniguchi - Hospital das Cl\u00ednicas, Universidade de S\u00e3o Paulo, Emergency Medicine Discipline, Sao Paulo, Brazil Intensive Care Medicine Experimental 2016, 4(Suppl 1): A791Introduction: QuickSOFA (qSOFA) was recently suggested to identify patients with suspected infection at higher risk of worse outcomes. However, qSOFA in non-infected patients has not been described. The objective of this study was to evaluate if qSOFA might predict hospitalmortality in a Brazilian cohort of non-infected critically ill patients.Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted at a private tertiary hospital (Hospital Sirio-Libanes) at S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. We ex- tracted relevant information from the adult intensive care unit (ICU)database (sistema Epimed ). A comparison was performed between SAPS 3 score model and qSOFA model at ICU admission both as a di- chotomous variable ( 2 criteria - \"qSOFA positive \"versus 0 -1 criterion - \"qSOFA negative \") and as an ordinal variable from 0 to 3 (according to the number of qSOFA criteria met) for predicting hospital mortality inpatients admitted to the ICU without infection. Models discriminations were compared using area under the ROC curves. Results: Between January 2012 to December 2014 we studied 1,150 patients (hospital mortality of 12 %). Patients who died were moreseverely ill compared to patients those who survived (SAPS 3 of 56 [47 -63] versus 36 [29 -45] respectively; p < 0.001), were older, more frequently came from the ward with longer hospital lengthof stay before ICU admission, had more comorbidities, more fre-quently required mechanical ventilation and vasoactive drugs as well as dialysis, had higher lactate levels at admission (2.1 [1.3 - 3.5] versus 1.6 [1.1 - 2.5] respectively; p < 0.001), and more 3 0 . 4%v s9 . 1%r e s p e c t i v e l y ,p < 0.001). However, area under ROC curve for SAPS 3 was higher (0.84 [95 % CI 0.82 - 0.86]) than for qSOFA both as a dichotom- ous variable (0.61 [95 % CI 0.58 - 0.64]) as an ordinal variable(0.67 [95 % CI 0.65 - 0.70]; p < 0.001 for comparisons betweenSAPS 3 and both qSOFA models). Conclusion: The utility of qSOFA to recognize severity of illness and predict mortality in our cohort of ICU patients is similar tothe previous description in suspected infection, but less accuratethan SAPS 3.
