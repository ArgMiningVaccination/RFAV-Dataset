I am always interested in research that touts alternative, clean, sustainable energy sources that could forever replace fossil fuels. I believe that new technology is the answer to solving the damage man has done. That seems ironic in that climate change has been caused by man's past technological endeavors using dirty energy sources. Crystal research is a long way from solving any of our energy problems, but it is something to be considered, along with all the other new and fresh ideas that science and technology are pursuing. New technology will give me hope until I read Carl Brady's next biweekly column telling us why it can't work. Why do I think Mr. Brady dislikes any energy that goes around his stock portfolio? Jim Davies, Longmont Arts center would benefit Longmont The ballot measure for an arts center in Longmont has been approved and voted on unanimously by the City Council and will appear on the ballot in November to be decided by the citizens of Longmont. The Times-Call has followed this proposal with care on how developing the sugar factory location, while remembering the past, by removing the blight and replacing it with something beautiful and badly needed. Longmont is surrounded by entertainment venues. Our arts community currently has no place to call home. Young people have no opportunity to enjoy and take part in the arts to build confidence and broaden their understanding of the diversity that is available in the art world. Seniors and the disadvantaged of Longmont are unable to improve their quality of life without traveling out of town and the problems and expenses such travel would involve. Those with health and memory issues would be able to benefit from access to the arts, thus improving their lives. We are already blessed with an education system that understands the value to our young people that comes from being exposed and involved in the arts. They are encouraged to learn discipline and to work with others to achieve a common goal. It is known that being involved with the arts improves learning and socialization in all other academic subjects. The economic benefit of such a center would have a huge impact on our sales tax base from local businesses, such as restaurants. Keeping the entertainment dollars from surrounding communities would profit the city by attracting a variety of groups from all genres to perform in such a facility. Such a center would be visible to all and announce that Longmont has always been a forward-thinking community and willing to plan for the future. Judith Watson, Longmont "}
