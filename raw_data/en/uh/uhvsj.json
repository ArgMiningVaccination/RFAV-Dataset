She had her 18 month vaccines on Wednesday. She had a low grade fever all day Thursday. I noticed her fever rise around 5 pm and gave her Tylenol. About 15 minutes later my son called me and said something was wrong with his sister. I found her standing perfectly still, unresponsive, eyes rolled back, drooling severely, lips turning blue, and she was repeatedly swallowing...like she was stuck on repeat. It lasted several minutes. I had called the ambulance and we went to the ER. It wasn't until 8 pm that she perked up a little. Today (Sunday) she is still not completely herself. What does this sound like to you? The drs tried to be very reassuring that it was likely a febrile seizure, but want to send us for testing because it was not normal... Thank you in advance for any thoughts/advice. I'm sorry for hacking this forum, but I figured that when it comes to seizures, you would be the most knowledgable/helpful. This is the closest thing I can find to what she had. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w_WPuofP0rM Comments Take it one step at a time Submitted by Roald on Mon, 2017-04-24 - 10:59 Take it one step at a time and focus on the information collection aspect more than the immediate diagnosis/treatment which can take some time to figure out properly. That process for me involved an assortment of ineffective, wrong, or condition worsening Rx's over several years before getting some better diagnostic answers and more appropriate treatments. Seek out as many answers before testing out different solutions. Continue asking lots of questions to every provider you see. I am tempted to go off on a tangent with vaccines here but will try to keep it short. Figure out exactly what vaccines you got, the manufacturer, the date they were made, and their exact ingredients. Keep this with you and show it to your providing Drs regarding possible known side effects and do your own research on the vaccine, manufacturer, country of origin, and ingredients to also share with you providers. My wife is allergic to some very common ingredients in them, one being propyethelyne glycol which is an industrial lubricant that is FDA approved food safe. (Also in my Rx pill) They have also scientifically proven a link between vaccines and peanut allergies because they commonly use a modified (GMO) peanut protein as a carrier oil in vaccines. These are only 2 examples of the garbage the Pharmaceutical industry likes to \"shoot-up\" our children with. Vaccines for adults are worse. Due to allergies we have not been able to give our son vaccines, luckily! Otherwise we would be legally required to in order to have him in any daycare, school, or children's activities or programs. Be aware that it is actually quite common for a vaccine to cause a fever and a \"small\" % of everyone who receives the vaccine actually contracts the illness from the vaccine even if not the full blown 100% illness you are trying to prevent. I hope your daughter just got a temporary fever and that is what triggered the seizure. I think the Drs were right to be hesitant but were also right to order more tests. Fevers, sinus infections, etc will trigger seizures in me too. I think you are smart to look for answers and try to learn the best thing to do in case it happens again. This website is an amazing resource for information. Try an allergy test on yourself and her father? If either of you are allergic to something in vaccines you can get a legal waiver to prevent future vaccinations. Take care and good luck Only an EEG and a pediatric Submitted by mereloaded on Wed, 2017-04-26 - 19:36 Only an EEG and a pediatric neurologist can tell. The Emetgency room can't tell help you because they know nothing about neurology. They can only refer you to the people that do. Ps/ BRE presents itself as a Submitted by mereloaded on Wed, 2017-04-26 - 19:41 Ps/ BRE presents itself as a very distinctive pattern of abnormal electrical activity of the brain with certain distinct characteristics, so NO ONE can diagnose BRE based on symptoms alone, burnt rather after the result of an Encephalogram. I know a lot of people cling to BRE from their Wikipedia diagnosis because sometimes it is outgrown, but no one can tell you without specialized tests and after seeing a pediatric neurologist. It could also be a febrile seizure, or it could be gazillion other things. The right move is to seek specialized help. Good luck "}
