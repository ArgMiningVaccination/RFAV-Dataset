It represents a convergence of molecular medicine, neuroscience and bioengineering. Bioelectronic medicine uses device technology to read and modulate the electrical activity within the body's nervous system, opening new doors to real-time diagnostics and treatment options for patients. We work to generate knowledge of the mechanisms of organ control by tapping into neural pathways, develop technology that delivers safe and effective therapies with fewer adverse effects, and rapidly advance our knowledge into clinical practice along a streamlined medical device regulatory pathway. Our two primary discoveries are first, that inflammation is the central phenomenon in virtually all disease, from cancer to diabetes, and second, inflammation can be controlled through the vagus nerve, the body's main \"highway\" of neural information that prompts and curbs inflammation. The institute's work in molecular biology to fully understand the vagus system and other nerve networks has led to a means to both monitor the neural signals produced by the body and decode them, not only to control inflammation, but to anticipate incipient disease before it takes hold. One of the exciting aspects of bioelectronic medicine is its potential to supplement and even replace drugs, including their cost and often debilitating side effects. Dr. Tracey explains the discovery of the inflammatory reflex and the crucial insight that curbing inflammation is critical to beating most disease. He reveals how the vagus nerve acts as a superhighway of information throughout the body and can be influenced to regulate inflammation.

We are working to develop devices to control the electrical signal used by the nervous system. Kevin J. Tracey, MD, talks to Nature about controlling inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating the vagus nerve. Researchers characterized the brain's responses to vagus nerve stimulation at various states of sleep and wakefulness to help determine efficacy. "}
