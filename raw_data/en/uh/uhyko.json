OBM Integrative and Complementary Medicine Traditional, complementary, and integrative medicine (TCIM) approaches to COVID-19 represent a paradigm shift from Western medicine, in that TCIM emphasizes prevention, encouraging wellness, and supporting health and recovery. A wide range of TCIM approaches exist: whole medical systems (such as traditional Chinese medicine), mind-body approaches, biological therapies, body-based treatments, and energy therapies. TCIM is used to help people resist infection, but people with moderate to severe COVID-19 symptoms often relied on integrative approaches using both traditional and Western medicine. It is estimated that over 90% of the infected population in Hubei China had used some form of traditional medicine to treat COVID. Ayurvedic medicine promotes immune-boosting strategies. Among biologically based therapies, there are vitamin therapies and \"immune-nutrition\" as well as traditional botanical treatments. Energy therapies have been promoted by the Chinese government to treat COVID-1... International Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences Covid-19, caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a life-threatening disease that has been declared a global pandemic. Even with the intervention of numerous medical systems to combat Covid-19, an effective remedy is not yet in sight rather than supportive therapies accompanied with anti-viral drugs and vaccines. The usage of these medicines has caused for unexpected side effects, and at present, various mutant forms of this virus have been identified from different countries. Hence, the necessity of an effective treatment regimen is highly expected. The attention direct towards Traditional Medicine (TM) is increasing day by day as it is well known for immune modulation. Therefore, this review was conducted with the aim of systematically reviewing the relevant literature of TM based on clinical studies conducted on Covid-19 patients and provides a summary on the evidence-based potential use of TM in the treatment of Covid-19. This review was conducted by using the databases; Science direct and PubMed for studies published from 1 st of December 2019 to 1 st of February 2021. In order to obtain further data, a manual search was also carried out. After scrutinizing all the articles, there were 29 total articles included in this present review. The evidence suggested that TM could regulate immunity and gives anti-viral, antiinflammatory effects along with disease management and prevention. However, if these treatment modalities have any public health implications, further randomized controlled trials in humans will be needed. Recently, a team of Scientists who led a mission in China by visiting there stated that the \"jump\" from bats to humans likely involved an intermediate host such as ferrets, rabbits, or bamboo rats susceptible to the virus and sold at the Wuhan market 4. The disease has spread all over the world, with more than 181,190,692 confirmed cases and 3, 925, 285 deaths as of June 26, 2021 5. The facts such as age above sixty-five years and co-morbidities like The SAGE Handbook of Social Studies in Health and Medicine 2021 There has been tremendous growth in the last twenty years in Complementary and Integrative Health and Medicine (CIHM) in the Western world. What is included in the CIHM (formerly known as complementary and alternative medicine or CAM) disciplines ranges from acupuncture and East Asian medicine, to chiropractic, to naturopathic medicine, to massage therapy to Ayurvedic medicine to mindfulness practices, diet therapies, herbal medicine and more. This chapter presents a global overview of complementary and integrative health and medicine, the implementation of governmental recognition and regulation of CIHM, and World Health Organization policies covering its modalities. Journal of Evidence-Based Integrative Medicine The management of the global pandemic outbreak due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been challenging with no exact dedicated treatment nor established vaccines at the beginning of the pandemic. Nonetheless, the situation seems to be better controlled with the recent COVID-19 vaccines roll-out globally as active immunisation to prevent COVID-19. The extensive usage and trials done in recent outbreak in China has shown the effectiveness of traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM) in improving the wellbeing of COVID-19 patients. Therefore, COVID-19 Prevention and Treatment guidelines has listed a number of recommended concoctions meant for COVID-19 patients. Licorice, more commonly known as Gancao in Chinese Pinyin, is known as one of the most frequently used ingredients in TCM prescriptions for treatment of epidemic diseases. Interestingly, it is deemed as food ingredient as well, where it is normally used in Western cuisines' desserts and sweets. The surprising fact that licorice... Up to now it has not yet been scientifically proven whether the technical methods of photonics in the field of photobiomodulation (PBM), photodynamic therapy (PDT), and laser acupuncture in connection with COVID-19 have achieved effective medical success. As part of this short technical note, an overview of the current scientific status is given and new equipment from our own research area is briefly presented. Although there are still many unanswered questions, it seems to be emerging that PBM and PDT in connection with the corresponding photosensitizers may make it appear worthwhile to perform experimental and clinical studies, primarily as so-called home therapy studies. In any case, the technical requirements for this are already in progress. The incidence and prevalence of valvular heart disease is high, and such disorders account for 10-20% of all cardiac surgical procedures in the United States.1,2 Symptoms and signs might be either absent or mimic those of heart failure, such as dyspnea, fatigue, cough, ankle edema, tachycardia, pulmonary rales, and so forth. The treatment of mitral regurgi- tation varies according to its severity; however, surgical corrections, repair or replacement, are the gold standard. The current pharmaco\u00actherapeutic regimen is comprised of -adrenoreceptor blockers, angiotensin receptor-blockers, diuretics, inotropic agents, and other agents. This case concerns a patient with severe, chronic mitral valve regurgitation and chest pain. She chose to pursue an alternative treatment for this condition, a technique developed by Reinhold Voll using electroacupuncture. This technique, known as \"Electroacupuncture according to Voll,\" plus the use of nosode therapy, helped alleviate the patient's chest pain, improved her quality of life, and increased her confidence level such that she was able to travel to receive the necessary biomedical intervention needed to resolve the underlying issue. Electroacupuncture according to Voll, an effective methodology for detecting disease, treating symptoms, and expediting treatment delivery, was used to treat this patient by synthesizing the application of Oriental medicine and homeopathy. These methodologies may also be used to facilitate treatment in patients with other related complex conditions. More research is warranted on this topic. Currently, the world is challenged by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Epidemiologists and researchers worldwide are invariably trying to understand and combat this precarious new disease. Scrutinizing available drug options and developing potential new drugs are urgent needs to subdue this pandemic. Several intervention strategies are being considered and handled worldwide with limited success, and many drug candidates are yet in the trial phase. Despite these limitations, the development of COVID-19 treatment strategies has been accelerated to improve the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19, and some countries have efficiently kept it under control. Recently, the use of natural and traditional medicine has also set the trend in coronavirus treatment. This review aimed to discuss the prevailing COVID-19 treatment strategies available globally by examining their efficacy, potential mechanisms, limitations, and challenges in predicting a future potential treatment candidate and bridging them with the effective traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). The findings might enrich the knowledge on traditional alternative medication and its complementary role with Western medicine in managing the COVID-19 epidemic. This book is the result of many minds, hearts, and souls who have shared a vision of healing with me. It would not exist without them. It began when Lance Sholdt, then at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, asked if I would work with him to put together a course in complementary and alternative medicine for the medical students. His careful construction of this course helped us outline the contents of the book. This book is the brainchild of Jeff Levin. He was the first to suggest that a textbook like this was needed and could be written. His heartfelt work and attention to detail kept things moving when I was bogged down. Janette Carlucci is the soul of the book, managing both the special features and the day-to-day contact with the many authors. To her, a special thanks on this journey. Ron Chez provided a much needed balance for the book. He was always ready and willing to assist with a critical eye and keep us anchored to how this book could be of benefit for patients. I would also like to thank the editors, Jane Velker, Beth Goldner, and Joyce Murphy, for understanding the complexity of the topic and for a commitment to quality over deadlines. And Tim Hiscock for finally saying that we were going to press\u2014 ready or not. I would just as soon have worked another three years on it as finish.
