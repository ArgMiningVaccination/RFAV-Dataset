Health isn't just about your physical well-being. It also includes your emotional, mental and spiritual wellness. But as we see more Indigenous doctors, health care professionals and healers enter the field, so too do we see the return of the medicine wheel. Here's what's on the show this week: Ending the silence around depression and reaching out is an important part of healing. It's something musician Tracy Bone knows all about. She stops in to perform live and explain why she put her music career on hold to deal with a difficult time in her life. A cultural twist on an ancient practice, Jade Harper combined Anishinabe teachings with the Indian discipline of yoga to create SpiritFusion. And Indigenous doula Melissa Brown explains why combining cultural practice with pregnancy care can help return the miracle of birth to community.
