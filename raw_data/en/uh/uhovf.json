Although folk remedies have been around for centuries, often co-existing with the treatments offered by orthodox medicine, medical experts say that over the past 10 years, more people have been turning to more kinds of alternative therapies than ever before. A national telephone survey, published in The New England Journal of Medicine in 1993, found that one of three Americans used unconventional therapies, which can range from taking vitamin C for a cold to going to Mexican clinics for outlawed cancer treatments. The survey also found that Americans spent $13.7 billion in 1991 on such treatments. Another national survey, published in 1994, found that 60 percent of doctors had at some time referred patients to practitioners of alternative medicine. The highly prestigious Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, which is associated with Harvard Medical School, recently set up a center for alternative medicine, as did Columbia University. And five years ago, the Federal Office of Alternative Medicine was established as part of the National Institutes of Health to provide the public with information on alternative treatments and to find out what works. A growing number of health insurance companies, which increasingly set the standards for care, now cover once obscure treatments like naturopathy. Practitioners of naturopathy say that disease arises from blockages in the flow of a life force through the body and that cures follow from treatments like acupuncture and homeopathy, treating patients with infinitesimal amounts of substances that in larger doses might produce symptoms of disease. Meanwhile, many makers of alternative remedies have been reporting record sales. This financial growth is a direct result, analysts say, of a 1994 Federal law curbing the regulation of the industry by the Food and Drug Administration. Many doctors, scientists and Government officials sharply criticize the practice of alternative medicine, saying that at best it does no harm and at its worst can do real danger. While conventional medicine adopts procedures that are consistent with established scientific hypotheses, and drugs must be stringently tested and approved by the F.D.A., alternative medicine practitioners can use therapies based on whims or discredited science, and their methods have not undergone rigorous tests. The critics of alternative medicine point to reports about the dangers posed by some alternative treatments. Herbal preparations like ma huang, used in dietary supplements and in widely available mood-altering products, have caused deaths, as have coffee enemas, said to treat cancer and other diseases by detoxifying the body. The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has documented cases of kidney failure and death in people who have had chelation therapy -- the intravenous injection of the synthetic chelating agent EDTA -- advertised as a treatment for heart disease and ailments like Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's and sexual impotency. The very name \"alternative medicine\" is Orwellian newspeak, implying that it is a viable option, said Dr. Marcia Angell, executive editor of The New England Journal of Medicine. \"It's a new name for snake oil,\" she said. \"There's medicine that works and medicine that doesn't work.\" Dr. Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said, \"Some say, 'Look, why not let desperately ill people do what they want? Why stand between them and the latest piece of shark cartilage?' \" But he disagrees. Dr. Caplan is gravely concerned, he said, that because of alternative medicine, some patients will reject reliable mainstream treatments. Practitioners of alternative medicine, he said, encourage patients to think that \"somehow, just by being out of the mainstream, nothing is risky or really dangerous or has side effects.\" It is, he said, \"ridiculous to say that chemotherapy can cause side effects but chelation therapy or coffee enemas, that's completely without risk.\" Alternative medicine encompasses a range of treatments outside those commonly accepted by the medical establishment. Generally, such treatments have not passed clinical trials. Although many medicinal herbs have pharmacologically active components, the focus of alternative medicine is not to isolate and test those ingredients. Alternative medicine includes therapies offered by chiropractors, acupuncturists and homeopaths. Also included may be treatments like aromatherapy, the use of aromatic oils for relaxation, which is also promoted as a cure for hundreds of diseases. Alternative medicines include herbs, taken for various ills; green algae pills, said to foster alertness, and shark cartilage, promoted as a natural cure for cancer. The regulation of alternative practices varies. All states license chiropractors, but only some license acupuncturists, naturopaths, homeopaths and practitioners of Chinese medicine. Some practitioners are M.D.'s, or have D.O., doctor of osteopathy, degrees, but others come from a broad range of backgrounds, ranging from correspondence courses to academic programs in schools that specialize in the field. Some supporters of alternative medicine say that it offers a much needed antidote to high-tech, impersonal, cost-driven health care, and that even if the treatments are not cures, they could have powerful placebo effects. They say it emphasizes a different view of health, one based on natural healing and nontoxic interventions. Dr. Andrew Weil, author of the best-selling book \"Spontaneous Healing\" (Alfred A. Knopf, 1995) and director of the program in integrative medicine at the University of Arizona College of Medicine, said that alternative medicine \"resonates with the spirit of the times.\" But the critics point to reports of people with serious illnesses who have failed to pursue standard treatments in favor of alternative therapies that have not worked. Anita Gergasko, of Hazlet, N.J., was 58 when she died in a hospice from metastatic breast cancer, which she had fought for seven years. She had a mastectomy, her husband, Gerald Gergasko, said, but refused her doctors' urging that she have chemotherapy, treating herself instead with massive doses of vitamin C and herbs. When the cancer later spread to her brain, she agreed to chemotherapy but also took megadoses of vitamin B12, which can counteract the chemotherapy drug she was taking. \"On her deathbed, she made me promise that I would see to it that nobody else in her family and none of her friends would get involved with this stuff,\" Mr. Gergasko said. The Approach A Reliance On Anecdotes The rise in alternative treatments can be explained in part by the limits of modern medicine. Even though conventional, science-based medicine has reached unsurpassed heights of technical sophistication, it is still far from perfect. For many ills, it has nothing very effective to offer; doctors can seem hurried and brusque, and conventional treatments can be costly or painful. But alternative therapies, unlike conventional ones, have not passed rigorous scientific tests showing that they are safe and effective. Generally, the only assurance patients have that alternative treatments will work is anecdotal evidence from other patients and practitioners. That dismays leaders of conventional medicine, who say that such evidence is not reliable because patients and their practitioners fervently desire success and are inclined to judge a treatment as more promising than it is. Dr. Weil, of the Arizona program, said he realized that alternative medicine treatments had not met scientific standards for efficacy and safety. But \"a great many things in standard medicine are not proven either -- we just do them,\" he said. Doctors do sometimes find that conventional treatments are ill advised. For example, doctors no longer advise stress reduction to treat ulcers. Even reducing the amount of salt in the diet is increasingly in question. But Dr. Caplan said Dr. Weil's response blurred the distinction between conventional and alternative medicine. \"Medicine at least has a tendency to be self-correcting and self-critical,\" he said. \"In lots of areas of alternative medicine, I haven't seen anybody even admit to the possibility of error.\" Dr. Weil said that as a practitioner, rather than a researcher, he was satisfied with \"a different standard of proof,\" like reports of patients who say they were helped. For disorders with no known cure, Dr. Weil said, \"if I am faced with an immediate need for a treatment that might alleviate suffering or possibly promote a cure, and if I can assure myself that a treatment is safe, it is reasonable to try it.\" But Dr. Richard A. Friedman, director of psychopharmacology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, said, \"Not only is it impossible for Dr. Weil to know if an untested treatment is safe, he also cannot know if it is dangerous.\" Untested treatments, Dr. Friedman said, \"range from harmless placebos to deadly poisons, and the consumer has no way of knowing which is which.\" The Debate Natural Healing, Or Quackery? Dr. Weil and others who support various forms of alternative medicine say it represents the rediscovery of a different way of thinking about health, one that forsakes rigid medical models and looks instead to natural ways of helping the body heal itself. Dr. David M. Eisenberg, who directs the new alternative medicine center in Boston and who conducted the national telephone survey on alternative medicine, said in an interview that for many people, alternative medicine might be a way of taking charge of their health or finding a practitioner who will take the time to listen to them. For many, the only harm is to their pocketbooks. But in a study published in 1991 in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Barrie R. Cassileth, an adjunct social psychologist at the University of North Carolina who studies patients' experiences with alternative cancer therapies, found -- to her surprise, she said -- that terminal cancer patients treated with coffee enemas and other alternative treatments were more miserable than those treated with chemotherapy and radiation and that their survival time was the same. Dr. Stephen Barrett, a retired psychiatrist and a board member of the National Council Against Health Fraud, sees another danger in the growth of alternative medicine, which he calls \"quackery.\" \"Quackery isn't necessarily about selling products and services -- it's about selling misbeliefs,\" Dr. Barrett said. \"For a quack to thrive, he has to promote unwarranted distrust. If you can convince someone that the Government is not going to give you accurate information on any health matter, that doctors and researchers cannot be trusted, then that person will be damaged. If you are not sick, these misbeliefs may not cause you serious harm. But if you are sick, they may kill you.\" Still, several voices within orthodox medicine have softened their criticism of alternative practices, though often for reasons that do not include a belief in their efficacy. At the American Cancer Society, a spokeswoman, Susan Islam, said the term \"unproven methods\" had recently been replaced by \"complementary and alternative methods\" because of a concern with \"political correctness.\" The term \"unproven,\" she said, \"is not P.C.\" The Regulations Industry Flourishes Under New Rules In 1994, Congress passed the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, which essentially did away with regulations on alternative medicines that called themselves foods or dietary supplements. Virtually overnight, it revolutionized the industry. Under the new law, products like herbs, shark cartilage or vitamins can be sold and promoted as cures for diseases or as treatments to enhance health as long as the claims were not on the product labels. Manufacturers can make product claims in books, pamphlets and signs in stores where the products are sold. Before, manufacturers could make no health claims that the F.D.A. had not approved. The leading supporter of the act was Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, a state whose dietary supplement industry has sales of $1 billion a year. Dietary supplements include vitamins and formulas for gaining weight, as well as herbs, shark cartilage and melatonin. Critics of the new law say it has exposed cancer patients to outrageous claims for useless treatments. Dr. Charles Myers, director of the cancer center at the University of Virginia, says the law has \"opened Pandora's box.\" But Mr. Hatch, who takes dietary supplements, is proud of his role in getting the law passed. \"These products have worked for people and helped people,\" he said. \"You show me a doctor who says they haven't helped, and if you do, I'll show you a prejudiced guy.\" Some alternative treatments are not regulated because they existed long before there were any regulations. Homeopathic medicines, for example, have never been subjected to testing for effectiveness because they were around before the F.D.A. had laws requiring that. They can stay on the market because the F.D.A. considers them safe. Other treatments are permitted because practitioners use a legal product; chelation therapy uses EDTA, which is approved for lead-poisoning therapy. Treatments like coffee enemas and juice diets for cancer are not regulated by the F.D.A. because they do not involve drugs. By all accounts, the alternative medicine business has grown explosively in recent years. In 1995, the stock of publicly traded dietary-supplement companies increased in value by 80 percent; so far this year, it is up 50 percent, said Matthew Patsky, an analyst with the Boston firm Adams, Harkness & Hill and a specialist in the dietary-supplement business. The 1995 increase for the Dow Jones industrial average was 33.5 percent; for this year, it is 10.4 percent. After the 1994 act became law, Mr. Patsky said, \"there was a recognition that there was not much risk in selling dietary supplements.\" So investors became interested, and that \"has created an opportunity for these companies to go ahead and raise money in the public markets,\" he added. The market for dietary supplements has grown by about 15 percent a year in the past few years, and one part of it, the herbal market, has grown by about 25 percent a year, he said. In contrast, the market for brand-name foods has grown by about 2 to 3 percent a year, Mr. Patsky said. Purveyors of specific therapies report unprecedented public interest. The American Colon Therapy Association, which promotes colonic irrigation, reports a 50 percent growth in the number of practitioners in the past year in the United States, with about 500 now practicing. Alternative medicine is finding more acceptance among insurers. In 1992, the American Western Life Insurance Company offered a plan that used naturopaths rather than conventional doctors. That plan accounts for 25 percent of new business this year, a representative of the company said. Richard Coorsh, a spokesman for the Health Insurance Association of America, said several state legislatures were now requiring insurance companies to cover various alternative therapies, like chiropractor and naturopath services. Insurance plans in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut must pay for chiropractors, and New York insurance plans must pay for podiatrists. But so far, insurance companies in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut do not have to pay for other alternative treatments. \"When you examine how much money is spent,\" said Dr. Raymond Lenhard, an oncologist at Johns Hopkins University and president of the American Cancer Society, \"you really should demand that there is some Alternative Medicine From time to time, articles will examine the growing role of alternative medicine, an unconventional approach to health embraced by its followers but criticized by many physicians and scientists. An article on Monday about the growth of alternative medical treatments into a big business and powerful force in modern medicine referred incorrectly to the claims that are legally permitted in promotional material for dietary supplements. The material may contain certain claims about how a supplement affects the function or well-being of the body, but not a claim that it cures disease. How we handle "}
