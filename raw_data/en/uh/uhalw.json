Certain things, like meditation, can keep us grounded and centered. When practiced daily, meditation can reduce stress and ease the mind so you can handle the challenges that come your way. Certain herbs have a calming effect and promote a sense of well-being, which can be beneficial to your mindfulness practice. Here are two of our favorite herbs for meditation.
