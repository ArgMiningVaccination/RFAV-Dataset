The Way We Care We are regional leaders in cardiology, women's health, cancer care, primary care and orthopedics, but our specialties and services span the full scope of medicine. We strive to be your health partner for life - your home when you need the care of your primary provider for an annual checkup, a specialist for a scary diagnosis or a nurse that's by your side for the birth of your first child. By providing every patient with The Meaning of Care, we've created a culture of compassion that puts you at ease and makes you family. The Way We Educate Our affiliate Nebraska Methodist College teaches The Meaning of Care by example, training the next generation of nurses and health care workers to excel in their fields and practice the same compassionate care that Methodist is known for. Methodist also provides educational opportunities for you. Whether you're enrolling in a course to take control of your diabetes or a busy working mother relying on our mobile medical units for screenings and education, we empower you with the knowledge to improve your health and change your lifestyle. The Way We Innovate Methodist is a leader in delivering cutting-edge care that produces the best outcomes for you and your loved ones. We value innovation and show our commitment to improving ourselves and your health through a variety of clinical trials, the latest technologies and resilient adaptability during public health crises and natural disasters. As we expand our footprint throughout Nebraska and western Iowa, we continue to invest in state-of-the-art facilities that help us provide the highest quality of care our communities deserve. Founded in 1982 and headquartered in Omaha, Methodist Health System is the region's oldest not-for-profit health care system. Methodist's commitment to providing exceptional care and serving the community is rooted in the founding of Methodist Hospital in 1891. "}
