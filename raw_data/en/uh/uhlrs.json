[Can acupuncture help neuropathy in feet?](https://www.findatopdoc.com/Questions/can-acupuncture-help-neuropathy-in-feet) Yes, acupuncture is very effective in treating neuropathy in feet. Neuropathy occurs in the feet or hands due to nerve damage. Over time, the nerves lose blood supply due to constriction which causes them to degenerate. They start sending abnormal signals to the brain as nerve damage progresses. People with Peripheral Neuropathy describe the pain as stabbing, burning, or tingling. Some people experience numbness as the nerve damage progresses. Once sensation is lost in the feet, balance problems start to occur and you may be at risk of falling. If it's in your hands, you may experience weakened grip and begin to drop things. THREE things to know to determine treatment: - What is the underlying cause? - How much nerve damage has been sustained? - How much treatment will be required? FOUR goals of treatment: - Increase blood flow - Stimulate nerve fibers - Decrease brain based pain - Enhance your quality of life! WHAT TO EXPECT We will provide a neurological and vascular exam to determine the extent of injury to the nerves. Then, we will develop a COMPREHENSIVE treatment plan customized for YOUR neuropathy symptoms. Your program will be based on the length of time you've had symptoms and the degree of sensory loss you're experiencing. (Please note: we do not accept patients with greater than 85% sensory loss.)

Acupuncture therapy sets off a cascade of events, producing a signal that travels along the spinal cord to the brain, triggering a release of neurotransmitters called endorphins and enkephalins, which scientists believe reduce the sensation of pain. Furthermore, research also shows that acupuncture induces the production of cortisol, a hormone that helps control inflammation. In addition, acupuncture may stimulate activity of other pain-relieving chemicals in the body as well.
