Moyer, MD, MPH, on behalf of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force* Description: Update of the 2003 U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommendation statement on screening for cervi-cal cancer. Methods: The USPSTF reviewed new evidence on the comparative test performance of liquid-based cytology and the benefits andharms of human papillomavirus (HPV) testing as a stand-alone testor in combination with cytology. In addition to the systematicevidence review, the USPSTF commissioned a decision analysis tohelp clarify the age at which to begin and end screening, theoptimal interval for screening, and the relative benefits and harmsof different strategies for screening (such as cytology andco-testing). Recommendations: This recommendation statement applies to women who have a cervix, regardless of sexual history. This rec-ommendation statement does not apply to women who have re-ceived a diagnosis of a high-grade precancerous cervical lesion orcervical cancer, women with in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol,or women who are immunocompromised (such as those who areHIV positive). The USPSTF recommends screening for cervical cancer in women aged 21 to 65 years with cytology (Papanicolaou smear) every 3years or, for women aged 30 to 65 years who want to lengthenthe screening interval, screening with a combination of cytologyand HPV testing every 5 years. See the Clinical Considerations for discussion of cytology method, HPV testing, and screening interval(A recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women younger than age 21 years (D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women older than age 65 years who have had adequate priorscreening and are not otherwise at high risk for cervical cancer. Seethe Clinical Considerations for discussion of adequacy of priorscreening and risk factors (D recommendation). The USPSTF recommends against screening for cervical cancer in women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervixand who do not have a history of a high-grade precancerous lesion(cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or 3) or cervical cancer (Drecommendation).

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specic clinical preventive services for patients without related signs orsymptoms. It bases its recommendations on the evidence of both the benets and harms of the service, and an assessment of thebalance. The USPSTF does not consider the costs of providinga service in this assessment.The USPSTF recognizes that clinical decisions involve more considerations than evidence alone. Clinicians shouldunderstand the evidence but individualize decision makingto the specic patient or situation. Similarly, the USPSTFnotes that policy and coverage decisions involve consider-ations in addition to the evidence of clinical benets andharms.

RATIONALE Importance The age-adjusted annual incidence rate of cervical can- cer is 6.6 cases per 100 000 women, according to datafrom 2008 (1-3). An estimated 12 200 new cases of cervi-cal cancer and 4210 deaths occurred in the United Statesin 2010 (1). Cervical cancer deaths in the United Stateshave decreased dramatically since the implementation ofwidespread cervical cancer screening. Most cases of cervicalcancer occur in women who have not been appropriatelyscreened (2, 3). Strategies that aim to ensure that allwomen are screened at the appropriate interval and receive adequate follow-up are most likely to be successful infurther reducing cervical cancer incidence and mortalityin the United States. Detection Screening with cervical cytology or testing for multiple oncogenic HPV types (a test for the presence of /H110222 high- risk or carcinogenic HPV types, hereafter called HPV test- ing) can lead to detection of high-grade precancerous cer- vical lesions and cervical cancer. Benefits of Detection and Early Intervention and Treatment Women Aged 21 to 65 Years There is convincing evidence that screening women aged 21 to 65 years with cytology every 3 years substan-tially reduces cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Among women aged 30 to 65 years, there is adequate ev-idence that screening with a combination of cytology andHPV testing (co-testing) every 5 years provides benetssimilar to those seen with cytology screening alone every 3years. Among women younger than age 30 years, there is adequate evidence that screening with HPV testing (alone orin combination with cytology) confers little to no benet. Women Younger Than Age 21 Years There is adequate evidence that screening women younger than age 21 years (regardless of sexual history)does not reduce cervical cancer incidence and mortalitycompared with beginning screening at age 21 years (4). Women Older Than Age 65 Years There is adequate evidence that screening women older than age 65 years who have had adequate priorscreening and are not otherwise at high risk provides littleto no benets. Women After Hysterectomy There is convincing evidence that continued screening after hysterectomy with removal of the cervix for indica-tions other than a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervi-cal cancer provides no benets. Harms of Detection and Early Intervention and Treatment Screening with cervical cytology or HPV testing can lead to harms, and the harms of screening can take manyforms. Abnormal test results can lead to more frequenttesting and invasive diagnostic procedures, such as colpos-copy and cervical biopsy. Evidence from randomized, con-trolled trials and observational studies indicates that harmsfrom these diagnostic procedures include vaginal bleeding,pain, infection, and failure to diagnose (due to inadequatesampling). Abnormal screening test results are also associ-ated with mild psychological harms; short-term increases inanxiety, distress, and concern about health have been re-ported with cytology and HPV testing. Harms of Treatment of Screening-Detected Disease The harms of treatment include risks from the treat- ment procedure itself and the potential downstreamconsequences of treatment. Summary evidence from ob-servational studies indicates that some treatments forprecancerous lesions (such as cold-knife conization andloop excision) are associated with adverse pregnancy out- comes, such as preterm delivery, that can lead to lowbirthweight in infants and perinatal death (2). Evidence isconvincing that many precancerous cervical lesions will re-Clinical Guideline Screening for Cervical Cancer www.annals.org 19 June 2012 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 156 \u007f Number 12 881gress and that other lesions are so indolent and slow- growing that they will not become clinically importantover a woman's lifetime; identication and treatment ofthese lesions constitute overdiagnosis. It difcult to esti-mate the precise magnitude of overdiagnosis associatedwith any screening or treatment strategy, but it is of con-cern because it confers no benet and leads to unnecessarysurveillance, diagnostic tests, and treatments with the asso-ciated harms.Women Aged 21 to 65 Years There is adequate evidence that the harms of screening for cervical cancer with cytology alone or in combinationwith HPV testing in women aged 30 to 65 years are mod-erate. Positive screening results are more common withstrategies that include HPV testing than with strategiesthat use cytology alone. Therefore, the likelihood ofprolonged surveillance and overtreatment may increasewith strategies that incorporate HPV testing. CervicalFigure.

SCREENING FOR CERVICAL CANCER CLINICAL SUMMARY OF U.S. PREVENTIVE SERVICES TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATION Population Recommendation Risk Assessment Screening Tests and Interval InterventionsTiming of Screening Other Relevant USPSTF RecommendationsBalance of Benefits and HarmsHPV infection is associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer. Other factors that increase a woman's risk for cervical c ancer include HIV infection, a compromised immune system, in utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, and previous treatment of a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer. Screening with cytology more often than every 3 years confers little additional benefit, with large increases in harms. harms, and is therefore a reasonable alternative for women in this age group who would prefer to extend the screening interval. Screening women younger than age 21 years, regardless of sexual history, leads to more harms than benefits. Clinicians and patients should base the decision to end screening on whether the patient meets the criteria for adequate prior testing and appropriate follow-up, per established guidelines. Screening aims to identify high-grade precancerous cervical lesions to prevent development of cervical cancer and early-stage asymptomatic invasive cervical cancer. High-grade lesions may be treated with ablative and excisional therapies, including cryotherapy, laser ablation, Early-stage cervical cancer may be treated with surgery (hysterectomy) or chemoradiation.Screen with cytology (Pap smear) every 3 years Grade: Ato 65 Years Screen with cytology every 3 years (cytology/ human papillomavirus testing [HPV]) every5 years Grade: AWomen Than Age 21 Years Do not screen Grade: DWomen Older Than Age 65 Years Who Have Had Adequate Prior Screening and Are Not High Risk Do not screen Grade: DWomen After Hysterectomy With Removal of the Cervix With No History of High-Grade Precancer or Cervical Cancer Do not screen Grade: DWomen Younger Than Age 30 Years Do not screen with HPV testing (alone or with cytology) Grade: D The benefits of screening with cytology every 3 years substantially outweigh the harms.The benefits of screening with co-testing (cytology/HPV testing) every 5 years outweigh the harms.The harms of screening earlier than age 21 years outweigh the benefits.The benefits of screening after age 65 years do not outweigh the potential harms.The harms of screening after hysterectomy outweigh the benefits.The potential harms of screening with HPV testing (alone or with cytology) outweigh the potential benefits.

Women Younger Than Age 30 Years There is adequate evidence that the harms of HPV testing (alone or in combination with cytology) in womenyounger than age 30 years are moderate. Women Younger Than Age 21 Years There is adequate evidence that the harms of screening in women younger than age 21 years are moderate. Women Older Than Age 65 Years There is adequate evidence that the harms of screening in women older than age 65 years who have had adequateprior screening and are not otherwise at high risk are atleast small. Women After Hysterectomy There is adequate evidence that screening after hyster- ectomy among women who do not have a history of ahigh-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer is associ-ated with harms.

However, for most individuals without signs or symptoms thereis likely to be only a small benefit from this service.Offer or provide this service only if other considerations support the offering or providing the service in anindividual patient. D The USPSTF recommends against the service. There is moderate or high certainty that the service has no net benefit or that the harms outweigh thebenefits.Discourage the use of this service. I Statement The USPSTF concludes that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of the service. Evidence is lacking, of poorquality, or conflicting, and the balance of benefits and harms cannot bedetermined.Read the clinical considerations section of USPSTF Recommendation Statement. If the service is offered,patients should understand the uncertainty about thebalance of benefits and harms. Table 2. Levels of Certainty Regarding Net Benefit* Level ofCertaintyDescription High The available evidence usually includes consistent results from well-designed, well-conducted studies in representativeprimary care populations. These studies assess the effectsof the preventive service on health outcomes. Thisconclusion is therefore unlikely to be strongly affected bythe results of future studies. Moderate The available evidence is sufficient to determine the effects of the preventive service on health outcomes, butconfidence in the estimate is constrained by such factorsas: the number, size, or quality of individual studies;inconsistency of findings across individual studies;limited generalizability of findings to routine primary care practice; and lack of coherence in the chain of evidence. As more information becomes available, the magnitude or direction of the observed effect could change, and thischange may be large enough to alter the conclusion. Low The available evidence is insufficient to assess effects on health outcomes. Evidence is insufficient because of: the limited number or size of studies;important flaws in study design or methods;inconsistency of findings across individual studies;gaps in the chain of evidence;findings that are not generalizable to routine primary care practice; and a lack of information on important health outcomes. More information may allow estimation of effects on health outcomes. *The USPSTF denes certainty as \"likelihood that the USPSTF assessment of the net benet of a preventive service is correct.\" The net benet is dened as benetminus harm of the preventive service as implemented in a general, primary carepopulation.

For women younger than age 30 years, there is mod- erate certainty that the potential harms of screening withHPV testing (alone or in combination with cytology) out-weigh the potential benets. CLINICAL CONSIDERATIONS Patient Population Under Consideration This recommendation statement applies to all women who have a cervix, regardless of sexual history. This recom-mendation statement does not apply to women who havereceived a diagnosis of a high-grade precancerous cervicallesion or cervical cancer, women with in utero exposure todiethylstilbestrol, or women who are immunocompro-mised (such as those who are HIV positive). Screening Tests The effectiveness of cervical cancer screening observed in the United States over the past several decades is attrib-uted to the use of conventional cytology. Current evidenceindicates that there are no clinically important differencesbetween liquid-based cytology and conventional cytology.The USPSTF realizes that the choice of cytology methodmay not be under the direct control of the clinician andconsiders cytology screening in appropriate age groups atappropriate intervals to be of substantial net benet, re-gardless of method. Human papillomavirus testing withDigene Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2) (Qiagen, Germantown,Maryland) is commonly used in the United States, andboth HC2 and polymerase chain reaction-based methodshave been evaluated in effectiveness trials. Although alter-native HPV detection methods are emerging, the clinicalcomparability and implications of these methods are notcompletely understood. Screening Interval Screening women aged 21 to 65 years every 3 years with cytology provides a reasonable balance between ben-ets and harms. Among women aged 30 to 65 years, HPVtesting combined with cytology (co-testing) every 5 yearsoffers a comparable balance of benets and harms and istherefore a reasonable alternative for women in this agegroup who would prefer to extend the screening interval.Screening with cytology more often than every 3 years con-fers little additional benet, with large increases in harms,including additional procedures and assessment and treat-ment of transient lesions. Treatment of lesions that wouldotherwise resolve on their own is harmful because it canlead to procedures with unwanted side effects, includingthe potential for cervical incompetence and preterm labor.Similarly, HPV testing with cytology should not be donemore often than every 5 years to maintain a reasonablebalance of benets and harms similar to that seen withcytology alone every 3 years. Maintaining the comparabil-ity of the benets and harms of co-testing and cytologyalone demands that patients, clinicians, and health care organizations adhere to currently recommended screeningintervals, protocols for repeated testing, cytologic thresh-olds for further diagnostic testing (that is, colposcopy) andtreatments, and extended surveillance as recommended bycurrent American Cancer Society/American Society forColposcopy and Cervical Pathology/American Society forClinical Pathology (ACS/ASCCP/ASCP) guidelines. Women who choose co-testing to increase their screening interval (and potentially decrease testing) shouldbe aware that positive screening results are more likely withHPV-based strategies than with cytology alone and thatsome women may require prolonged surveillance with ad-ditional frequent testing if they have persistently positiveHPV results. Because HPV test results may be positiveamong women who would otherwise be advised to endscreening at age 65 years on the basis of previously normalcytology results alone, the likelihood of continued testingmay increase with HPV testing. The percentage of U.S.women undergoing co-testing who will have a normal cy-tology test result and a positive HPV test result (and whowill therefore require additional testing) ranges from 11%among women aged 30 to 34 years to 2.6% among womenaged 60 to 65 years (5, 6). Timing of Screening Women Younger Than Age 21 Years Cervical cancer is rare before age 21 years. The USPSTF found little evidence to determine whether andhow sexual history should affect the age at which to beginscreening. Although exposure of cervical cells to sexuallytransmitted HPV during vaginal intercourse may lead tocervical carcinogenesis, the process has multiple steps, in-volves regression, and is generally not rapid. There is evi-dence that screening earlier than age 21 years, regardless ofsexual history, would lead to more harm than benet (4).The harms are greater in this younger age group becauseabnormal test results are likely to be transient and to re-solve on their own; in addition, treatment may have anadverse effect on childbearing. Women Older Than Age 65 Years Clinicians and patients should base the decision to end screening on whether the patient meets the criteria for ad-equate prior testing and appropriate follow-up per estab-lished guidelines. The ACS/ASCCP/ASCP guidelines de-ne adequate prior screening as 3 consecutive negativecytology results or 2 consecutive negative HPV resultswithin 10 years before cessation of screening, with themost recent test occurring within 5 years. They furtherstate that routine screening should continue for at least 20years after spontaneous regression or appropriate manage-ment of a high-grade precancerous lesion, even if this ex-tends screening past age 65 years (7). The ACS furtherstates that screening should not resume after cessation inClinical Guideline Screening for Cervical Cancer 884 19 June 2012 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 156 \u007f Number 12 www.annals.orgwomen older than age 65 years, even if a woman reports having a new sexual partner. Women Older Than Age 65 Years Who Have Never Been Screened Screening may be clinically indicated in older women for whom the adequacy of prior screening cannot beaccurately accessed or documented. Women with limitedaccess to care, minority women, and women from coun-tries where screening is not available may be less likely to meet the criteria for adequate prior screening. TheUSPSTF realizes that certain considerations may supportscreening in women older than age 65 years who are oth-erwise considered high risk (such as women with a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer, women within utero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, or women who areimmunocompromised). Assessment of Risk It is well-established that HPV infection is associated with nearly all cases of cervical cancer. Other risk factorsinclude HIV infection, a compromised immune system, inutero exposure to diethylstilbestrol, and previous treatmentof a high-grade precancerous lesion or cervical cancer. Women who have had a hysterectomy with removal of the cervix and who do not have a history of a high-gradeprecancerous lesion or cervical cancer are not at risk forcervical cancer and should not be screened. Women whohad their cervix removed during surgery for ovarian orendometrial cancer are not at high risk for cervical cancerand would not benet from screening. Clinicians shouldconrm through review of surgical records or direct exam-ination that the cervix was removed. Treatment Screening aims to identify high-grade precancerous cervical lesions to prevent development of cervical cancerand early-stage asymptomatic invasive cervical cancer.High-grade lesions may be treated ablative and exci-sional The treatment of precancerous ratherthan early-stage cancerous lesions is unique to cervical can-cer and is the foundation of the success of cervical cancerscreening. Treatment of precancerous lesions is less inva-sive than treatment of cancer and results in fewer adverseeffects. Other Approaches to Prevention Many individuals and clinicians have used the annual Pap smear screening visit as an opportunity to discuss otherhealth problems and preventive measures. Individuals, cli-nicians, and health systems should seek effective ways tofacilitate the receipt of recommended preventive services atintervals that are benecial to the patient. Efforts shouldalso be made to ensure that individuals are able to seek care for additional health concerns as they present. The overall effect of HPV vaccination on high-grade precancerous cervical lesions and cervical cancer is not yetknown. Current trials do not provide data on long-termefcacy (8); therefore, the possibility that vaccinationmight reduce the need for screening with cytology alone orin combination with HPV testing is not established. Giventhese uncertainties, women who have been vaccinatedshould continue to be screened. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS Research Needs and Gaps There are notable limitations to the current evidence. There is limited direct evidence on the harms of variousscreening strategies that incorporate HPV testing. Addi-tional data from ongoing trials on cervical cancer outcomesand the resulting number of false-positive test results, col-poscopies, and biopsies should help to clarify some of thecurrent uncertainties related to strategies that include HPVtesting. Moreover, these data should help to better assessthe comparative effectiveness and harms of various screen-ing strategies using cytology and HPV testing alone, incombination, or sequentially. An important clinical limitation of the current evi- dence is the lack of long-term cumulative data from screen-ing trials on cervical cancer. Much of the data to date arelimited to detection of CIN grade 3. Although CIN3 maybe considered an acceptable surrogate for cancer, additionaldata are needed to determine benets, harms, and net ben-et. Future screening trials should plan for and reportround-specic data as well as cumulative results from mul-tiple screening rounds to obtain useful cumulative data onCIN3, cervical cancer by stage and type, and program re-quirements (such as colposcopy, biopsy, treatments, orharms of treatment). More complete outcomes data willhelp to better assess the relative benets of different screen-ing strategies, particularly in comparing various approachesinvolving cytology and HPV testing. There is limited evidence on the benets and harms of HPV testing alone as a screening strategy. An emergingchain of evidence suggests that HPV testing followed bycytology in women with positive HPV test results may alsobe a reasonable screening strategy. Ongoing studies, suchas the HPV FOCAL (HPV Testing for Cervical CancerScreening) compares HPV with cytology triageto cytology with HPV triage of test results interpreted asatypical squamous cells of undetermined signicance,should provide relevant direct evidence on HPV testingthat applies to current U.S. practice. Finally, more research is needed to determine whether and how individual risk factors may be used to tailorscreening, thereby preventing overdiagnosis and overuti-lization of resources in women at low risk for cervical can-cer, as well as underdiagnosis in those at high risk. Deter-Clinical Guideline Screening for Cervical Cancer www.annals.org 19 June 2012 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 156 \u007f Number 12 885mining risk factors that move lower-risk women (such as older women with normal cytology ndings or negativeHPV test results) into higher risk categories (such as olderwomen with positive HPV and negative cytology results orexposure to new partners) will also be important. DISCUSSION Burden of Disease Cervical cancer incidence and mortality have declined in the United States since the introduction of cervical can-cer screening in the 1950s and 1960s. The current annualincidence rate is 6.6 cases per 100 000 women, and theage-adjusted mortality rate is 2.4 deaths per 100 000 (for2003 to 2007) (1). However, cervical cancer still remains asubstantial public health issue. Incidence rates (2004 to2008) vary by age and race or ethnicity; Hispanic (11.1 per100 000) and black (10.0 per 100 000) women experiencethe highest rates, whereas non-Hispanic white (7.4 per100 000), American Indian and Alaska Native (7.8 per100 000), and Asian and Pacic Islander (7.3 per 100 000)women have lower rates (1). Cervical cancer most com-monly occurs in women aged 35 to 55 years. In contrast tocervical cancer, abnormal cytology test results and precan-cerous lesions are fairly common. According to Centers forDisease Control and Prevention data from low-income,uninsured, and underserved women, approximately 3.0%of cytology test results are abnormal (9). Scope of Review To update the 2003 recommendation, the USPSTF commissioned a targeted systematic review of the evidenceon screening strategies incorporating HPV testing that mayapply to current screening practices in the United States.The USPSTF reviewed new evidence regarding the com-parative test performance of liquid-based cytology and thebenets and harms of HPV testing as a standalone test orin combination with cytology. In addition to the systematic evidence review, the USPSTF commissioned a decision analysis to help clarifythe age at which to begin and end screening, the optimalinterval for screening, and the relative benets and harmsof different strategies for screening (such as cytology andco-testing). The USPSTF uses modeling as a complementto evidence reported in the systematic review, to provideinformation about alternate screening or treatment strate-gies in the absence of direct evidence, or when the com-plexities required to conduct randomized, controlled trialsto address knowledge gaps would preclude the ability toobtain direct evidence. The USPSTF does not use model-ing to make recommendations for or against screening ortreatment. The USPSTF did not review evidence on automated screening technologies because they are less relevant to pri-mary care clinicians, and it did not review evidence onHPV vaccination because data to determine long-term vac-cine efcacy or how vaccination will affect screening are limited. Accuracy of Screening Tests Liquid-Based Cytology Compared With Conventional Cytology Evidence suggests that there are no clinically meaning- ful differences in accuracy between liquid-based cytologyand conventional cytology. One large, good-quality ran-domized trial (10) and one large, fair-quality randomizedtrial (11) of more than 130 000 women compared the 2screening methods and found no difference in detection ofCIN2/H11001or CIN3 /H11001at any cytologic threshold of positivity. With Cytology Evidence from good- and fair-quality observational studies indicates that HPV testing generally has a highersensitivity but lower specicity (that is, more false-positivetest results) than does cytology in the detection of CIN2 /H11001 and CIN3 /H11001(12-18). False-positive rates are higher among women younger than age 30 to 35 years than women inolder age groups because of the higher prevalence of HPV,but the incidence of cervical cancer is lower in the formerage group. Effectiveness of Early Detection or Treatment Introduction of screening to populations naive to screening reduces cervical cancer rates by 60% to 90%within 3 years of implementation (19). The reduction ofmortality and morbidity associated with the introductionof cytology-based screening is consistent and equally dra-matic across populations. Correlational studies of cervicalcancer trends in countries in North America and Europedemonstrate dramatic reductions in incidence of invasivecervical cancer and a 20% to 60% reduction in cervicalcancer mortality since the onset of widespread screening. No published studies have evaluated, in an ideal way, the age at which to begin screening, the age at which toend screening, and how often to screen. The USPSTF con-sidered the following types of evidence to determine whenscreening for cervical cancer should begin: incidence, prev-alence, and mortality of cervical cancer in young women;the natural history of precancerous lesions and HPV infec-tion; and the effects of screening in populations of youngwomen. Cervical cancer in women younger than age 20years is rare; according to U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology,and End Results (SEER) data, 0.1% of all incident cancercases occur in women younger than age 20 years. Olderdata from SEER (1) report declining rates of cervical can-cer in the years 1973 to 1999; in some years, no casesoccurred in women younger than age 20 years (2, 3, 18).Deaths due to cervical cancer in women younger than age20 years are also rare; fewer than 16 such deaths occurredin the United States from 1992 through 2008 (1). Precan-cerous lesions are also uncommon. Prevalence of CIN3among women younger than age 20 years is estimated at0.2% (20, 21), with a concurrent rate of false-positive cy-tology results of about 3.1% (21). Because of the lack ofClinical Guideline Screening for Cervical Cancer 886 19 June 2012 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 156 \u007f Number 12 www.annals.orgdirect evidence, the USPSTF considered results of decision analyses using the best available data to estimate and un-derstand the benets and harms of screening at differentstarting ages and intervals; colposcopy was used as a proxymeasure for harms. Results of the analyses show thatscreening every 3 years with cytology starting at age 21years confers a similar number of life-years as does annualscreening (69 247 vs. 69 213 per 1000 women), yetprompts fewer than half of the number of colposcopies andfewer false-positive test results. Varying the age at which tostart screening shows no benet to starting earlier than age21 years; screening with cytology every 3 years starting at15 years of age, 18 years of age, and 21 years of age ndscervical cancer death rates of 1.54, 1.54, and 1.55 per 1000women, respectively (4). The results of these analyses sug-gest that screening beginning at age 21 years with an in-terval of 3 years provides the most acceptable balance ofbenets and harms. When deliberating on the age at which to end screen- ing, the USPSTF considered the incidence of cervical can-cer in older women and whether there is a difference in thepattern of cervical cancer incidence in screened versus un-screened women. The incidence and prevalence of CINpeak in the midreproductive years and begin to decline inapproximately the fourth decade of life, a general patternalso apparent among some previously unscreened women.Cervical cancer in older women is not more aggressive orrapidly progressive than that in younger women. Finally,the rate of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions di-agnosed by cytology is low among older women who havebeen previously screened. Modeling studies of the age atwhich to end screening indicate no substantial benet be-yond age 65 years in women who have been previouslyscreened. Specically, varying the age at which to endscreening from 65 years to 95 years by 5-year intervalsprovides a very small ( /H110211 life-year) improvement in life- years after age 65 years but increases potential harms due tofalse-positive results and the increase in the number of col-poscopies and cervical biopsies (4). Although screening women older than age 65 years who have an adequate screening history is not recom-mended, modeling studies suggest that screening womenwho have never been screened would reduce mortality by74% (3, 22). Strategies that include screening previouslyunscreened women every 2 to 5 years and ending at age 70to 75 years represent reasonable tradeoffs between benetsand harms (4). Current guidelines dene adequate screen-ing as 3 consecutive negative cytology results or 2 consec-utive negative HPV results within 10 years before cessationof screening, with the most recent test performed within 5years (7). Women with a clearly inadequate screening his-tory are those who have never been screened or have notbeen recently screened before age 65 years. About half ofall invasive cervical cancer cases are diagnosed in womenwho have never been screened or have not been screened inthe last 5 years (and another 10% occurs in women whodid not have appropriate follow-up for an abnormal Pap smear) (23). Data from a statewide cervical cancer screen-ing program reveal that 29% of invasive cervical cancercases occurred in women who had never undergone cervi-cal cytology screening (23). Data varied by age; 25% ofwomen aged 18 to 29 years with cancer reported no pre-vious Pap tests, and 42% of those aged 65 years or olderwith cancer had never been screened (24). Efforts to fur-ther reduce the burden of cervical cancer mortality can bebest achieved by focusing on women who have not beenadequately screened. Although cervical cancer screening with cytology alone every 3 years is an effective strategy, HPV testing com-bined with cytology every 5 years is a reasonable alternativefor women aged 30 to 65 years who want to potentiallyincrease the testing interval. The USPSTF reviewed 4 fair-quality randomized, controlled trials conducted outside States in ARTISTIC Trial of HPV Testing in Primary Cervical Screen-ing]) that compared cytology alone with cytology plusHPV testing (HC2 or polymerase chain reaction) (25-30).Published data from the 4 trials show a similar number ofdetected cancer cases with either strategy, although differences in colposcopy referral and treatment thresholds and incom-plete reporting of data from the second screening round makeinterpretation complex. In all 4 trials, there were slightly lowerrates of CIN3 /H11001detected in the second round of screening and fewer cancer cases in the co-testing group than in thecytology group. These differences were very small, and notall were statistically signicant. In one of the largest trialswith the longest follow-up (POBASCAM), more than44 000 women in the Netherlands were randomly assignedto HPV testing with cytology or cytology alone, with re-peated screening with co-testing at 5-year intervals. Cumu-lative data at 9 years of follow-up demonstrated a similarabsolute number of cancer cases in each group (16 vs. 20cases; P/H110050.67) (30). Detection of CIN3 /H11001was similar between the 2 groups. Further data on the comparability ofthese 2 strategies from a longitudinal cohort study by Katkiand colleagues of 330 000 U.S. women were published in2011 (31). Cumulative 5-year incidence of cervical cancerwas lower in the HPV-negative and cytology-negativegroup than in the cytology-negative group (3.2 per100 000 vs. 7.5 per 100 000). Detection of CIN3 /H11001was higher in earlier screening rounds with co-testing than withcytology alone. Modeling studies support similar benetsof co-testing every 5 years and cytology every 3 years, dem-onstrating small differences in expected cancer cases (7.44vs. 8.50 cases, respectively) and cancer deaths (1.35 vs.1.55 deaths, respectively) (4). Two large studies documenting the low risk for cyto- logic abnormalities after hysterectomy have been pub-lished. A cross-sectional study of more than 5000 cytologytests among women older than age 50 years documented Clinical Guideline Screening for Cervical Cancer www.annals.org 19 June 2012 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 156 \u007f Number 12 887that identication of vaginal intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer was rare in this age group after hysterectomy (0.18per 1000 women screened) (32). In a second study ofnearly 10 000 Pap tests performed over 2 years in 6265women who had a hysterectomy with removal of the cer-vix, screening yielded 104 abnormal Pap results but only 4high-grade lesions: 3 cases of vaginal intraepithelial neopla-sia and 1 case of squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina(rate of 0.42 high-grade lesion per 1000 Pap tests) (33).Whether detection of these vaginal lesions improved clini-cal outcomes is unknown. Potential Harms of Screening or Treatment Harms of screening with cytology include short-term psychological distress (anxiety, concern) related to positiveresults and the time and burden resulting from the evalu- ation of false-positive test results. Colposcopies and biop-sies can occur in response to false-positive results and canbe used as a proxy measure for potential downstreamharms. Recent data suggest that there is a risk for adverseeffects with these procedures. The results of a randomizedtrial comparing surveillance with immediate colposcopyamong women with minimally abnormal cytology test re-sults showed a substantially lower proportion of women inthe surveillance group who reported pain (15% vs. 39%),bleeding (17% vs. 47%), or discharge (9% (34). Common treatments of high-grade precancerous le- sions in the United States include cervical conization orloop electrosurgical excision, both of which can be associ-ated with potential short- and long-term risks. Studiesshow that short-term risks include pain, bleeding, and dis-charge (2). One cohort study found that 67% of womenwho had loop excision reported pain, 87% reported bleed-ing, and 63% reported discharge (34). In addition to sur-gical risks inherent to excisional therapies for neoplasticlesions, treatment may increase risk for adverse outcomesof future pregnancies, including perinatal mortality, pre-term delivery before 34 weeks' gestation, and low birth-weight (35, 36). To date, the evidence for adverse preg-nancy events after cold-knife conization or loop excision isincomplete and based largely on retrospective studies, withsome inconsistencies in the categorization of the proce-dures performed (2). Because the rate of positivity on HPV testing is gen- erally higher than that for cytology, strategies that incor-porate HPV testing will identify women who are HPVpositive but have no evidence of a high-grade precancerouslesion; among women aged 30 years or older in primaryscreening settings, this proportion ranges from 4.8% to17% (14, 16). From U.S. studies, the proportion ofwomen undergoing co-testing who can expect to have apositive HPV test result and normal cytology ndings var-ies by age, ranging from 11% among women aged 30 to 34years to 2.6% among women aged 60 to 65 years (5, 6).Guidelines for management of these women have beenpublished by ACS/ASCCP/ASCP (7). Achieving the ben-ets of HPV testing with cytology without increasing the risk for overtreatment will require clinicians to be respon-sive to currently recommended algorithms for clinicalsurveillance. The lower specicity of HPV testing (that is, higher false-positive rate) raises important concerns about unnec-essary diagnostic testing (that is, colposcopy) as well asidentication and treatment of precancerous lesions (suchas CIN2) that may regress. The POBASCAM trial re-ported a modestly higher cumulative detection of CIN2with HPV testing and cytology versus cytology alone (168vs. 127 cases) (26, 30). On the basis of these ndings, 8CIN2/CIN3 lesions would have to be treated to prevent 1case of cervical cancer (37). Although most trials have notyet reported nal cumulative colposcopy rates, data fromARTISTIC show a slightly higher proportion of colpos-copy referrals in the co-testing group than with cytologyalone (6% vs. 4.9%, respectively), and early results from anongoing trial comparing screening with HPV testing versuscytology also suggests higher rates of colposcopy referralsresulting from the rst round of screening with HPV (28,29, 37). Modeling studies commissioned by the USPSTF,however, show a modest increase in colposcopy with cytol-ogy alone compared with HPV testing plus cytology andfewer overall positive test results over a lifetime of screen-ing. Assuming screening with cytology every 3 years beforeage 30 years and then co-testing every 5 years in a hypo-thetical cohort of 1000 women, modestly fewer lifetimecolposcopies could be expected with co-testing than withcytology (758 vs. 575, respectively), but more lifetime testscould be expected (approximately 5000 more lifetime testsper 1000 women with co-testing). Cumulative data fromthe POBASCAM trial as well as round-specic results fromongoing trials reviewed by the USPSTF should be inter-preted cautiously because there are limitations in study de-sign and diagnostic protocols (for example, cytologicthresholds for colposcopy referral and randomizationschemes in subsequent rounds of screening) that could al-ter the balance of benets and harms, particularly whenthese ndings are translated to U.S. practice. Additionalround-specic and cumulative data from ongoing trialsmay further inform the balance of potential benets andharms of HPV testing combined with cytology versus cy-tology alone. Other potential harms of HPV testing include psycho- logical distress associated with a positive result and unnec-essary evaluation of a false-positive result, as well as thetime required by the patient for repeated sampling due toan inadequate or insufcient specimen. Although somewomen may value information about HPV status, theUSPSTF found evidence of adverse short-term psycholog-ical harms associated with knowledge of HPV positivity.Four fair-quality observational studies conducted in coun-tries with well-developed cervical cancer screening pro-grams, including a subset of women in an Australian trial(38), examined the immediate and short-term effect of Clinical Guideline Screening for Cervical Cancer 888 19 June 2012 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 156 \u007f Number 12 www.annals.orgHPV testing in more than 4000 women (2). Immediate anxiety and stress levels increased in women who testedpositive for HPV compared with those who tested nega-tive; these differences were resolved after 6 months offollow-up. Data on longer-term follow-up of women un-dergoing HPV testing are limited. No treatments are avail-able to eliminate HPV. Although there is evidence ofharms of strategies that incorporate HPV testing in womenaged 30 to 65 years, the USPSTF concludes that there isadequate evidence that the longer screening interval forHPV testing with cytology reduces the magnitude of theseharms by decreasing the opportunity for false-positive testresults. Current evidence suggests that there are moderateharms of HPV testing among women younger than age 30years. The high prevalence of HPV, higher likelihood of regression of precancerous lesions, and low incidence of cervi-cal cancer in this age group potentiate the harms of unnec- essary colposcopy and biopsy. The higher false-positive ratealso increases the possibility of unnecessary treatment andthe potential for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Estimate of Magnitude of Net Benefit The effectiveness of cervical cancer screening observed in the United States over the past several decades is attrib-uted to the use of conventional cytology. Although there islittle direct evidence from studies applicable to the U.S.population that provides an estimate of the magnitude ofnet benet, observational evidence provides high certaintythat the introduction of screening substantially reducesrates of cervical cancer. Recommendations regarding ap-propriate screening intervals seek to achieve these benetswith relatively few harms. The harms of screening women younger than age 21 years outweigh the benets given the high prevalence ofHPV infection and associated transient cytologic abnor-malities in young women; detection of these abnormalitiesmay prompt invasive procedures and excisional treatmentsthat have been associated with subsequent adverse preg-nancy outcomes. Because of the low incidence of high-grade precancerous lesions and cervical cancer in ade-quately screened older women, screening for cervicalcancer in women older than age 65 years is of little benet.The harms of screening women older than age 65 years,including false-positive results and complications fromfollow-up and treatment of abnormalities, are judged bythe USPSTF to be small. After balancing the potentialbenets and harms, there is moderate certainty that screen-ing women older than age 65 years has no benet if theyhave been previously adequately screened. After hysterec-tomy for reasons other than a high-grade precancerous le-sion or cervical cancer, screening the vagina for precancer-ous lesions is of little benet and has the potential for harmdue to positive test results, with subsequent invasive pro-cedures and treatments. Although none of the reported trials compared HPV testing with cytology-based screening as currently per-formed in the United States, the USPSTF was able to draw several relevant conclusions from these trials and others(26-29, 39-43), in addition to epidemiologic and naturalhistory data (2, 18). In women younger than age 30 years,the USPSTF found evidence that the potential harms ofHPV testing outweigh the potential benets and con-cluded that there was no net benet of HPV testing, aloneor in combination with cytology, in this age group. Thisconclusion was based on the consistent and substantiallyhigher HPV positivity rates in young women comparedwith older women and the potential to cause short-termadverse psychological effects and adverse pregnancy out-comes in this group of childbearing women. Detection ofCIN2 is also increased with HPV testing. Many CIN2lesions will regress, and overtreatment is a concern. Inwomen aged 30 to 65 years, the USPSTF found that theevidence was adequate to conclude that the potential ben-et of HPV testing in combination with cytology every 5years is similar to the benets achievable with cytologyalone every 3 years. How Does Evidence Fit With Biological Understanding? The natural history of cervical cancer has been well- studied. Human papillomavirus infection of the cervix isgenerally transient, but when the infection is not cleared byan appropriate immune response and the HPV is of anoncogenic type, the infection can result in incorporation ofHPV gene sequences into the host genome, which can leadto precancerous lesions. The long preclinical phase frominfection to development of precancerous lesions and cer-vical cancer allows for the opportunity to efciently screenfor and identify precancerous lesions and treat them,thereby reducing the incidence of cervical cancer incidenceand mortality. Response to Public Comments A draft version of this recommendation statement was posted for public comment on the USPSTF Web site from19 October, through 30 November 2011. Many com-ments pointed out a lack of clarity about the harms offalse-positive results and the harms of screening with cytol-ogy more frequently than every 3 years or screeningwomen younger than age 21 years. Several comments re-quested clarication on how information about sexual his-tory may affect screening. Some comments highlighted theimportance of reaching women who are not being screenedat all. Many comments urged the USPSTF to reconsider itsdraft recommendation on HPV co-testing and review newevidence that had been published since its deliberation. Inresponse to these comments, the USPSTF clariedthroughout the statement the harms that would occur fromscreening too frequently and in women younger than age21 years. The USPSTF also claried that this recommen-dation statement applies to women regardless of sexual his-tory. The USPSTF agrees that the greatest effect on cervi-cal cancer incidence and mortality would result fromClinical Guideline Screening for Cervical Cancer www.annals.org 19 June 2012 Annals of Internal Medicine Volume 156 \u007f Number 12 889efforts to screen women who have not been adequately screened, and this is stated in the Rationale and elsewhere. After the public comment period, the USPSTF con- sidered new evidence that was published since its initialdeliberation\u2014specically the update of the POBASCAMresults and the study by Katki and colleagues (30, 31).With this new evidence, in addition to the previously con-sidered evidence, the USPSTF decided to recommendHPV testing combined with cytology (co-testing) as a rea-sonable alternative for women aged 30 to 65 years whowish to extend the screening interval beyond 3 years. UPDATE OF PREVIOUS USPSTF R ECOMMENDATION This recommendation updates the 2003 USPSTF rec- ommendation (44) on screening for cervical cancer. It differsfrom the previous recommendation in that it recommendscytology screening every 3 years among women aged 21 to 65years. In addition, this recommendation includes more guid-ance on the appropriate age ranges and frequency of screen-ing, including a new recommendation that women youngerthan age 21 years not be screened because the evidence showsno net benet. The previous recommendation suggested thatmost of the benet of screening could be obtained by begin-ning screening within 3 years of onset of sexual activity or age21 years (whichever comes rst) and screening at least every 3years. This recommendation reafrms the previous recom-mendations against screening in adequately screened womenolder than age 65 years and in women who have had a totalhysterectomy with removal of the cervix. The current recom-mendation includes new evidence on the comparative test per-formance of liquid-based versus conventional cytology thatindicates no substantial difference in test performance (that is,relative detection or absolute sensitivity or specicity) for de-tection of CIN2 /H11001/CIN3/H11001. It also includes more guidance on the appropriate use of HPV testing in cervical cancerscreening, including a new recommendation that womenyounger than aged 30 years not be screened with HPV testing.The USPSTF found new evidence that addressed the gapsidentied in the previous recommendation and allowed theUSPSTF to recommend HPV testing combined with cytol-ogy as an acceptable screening strategy for women aged 30 to65 years who prefer to lengthen their screening interval be-yond 3 years. RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS The ACS, ASCCP, and ASCP recently published screening guidelines that are very similar to the USPSTF'srecommendations (7). The ACS/ASCCP/ASCP recom-mend that women aged 21 to 29 years be screened withcytology (cervical cytology testing or Pap testing) aloneevery 3 years. Women aged 30 to 65 years should bescreened with cytology and HPV testing (co-testing) every5 years or cytology alone every 3 years. The guidelinesfurther state that no woman should be screened every yearand that women aged 21 to 29 years should not be screenedwith HPV testing or combined cytology and HPV testing. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologistsand the American Academy of Family Physicians have previ-ously published screening guidelines (45, 46) and are evaluat-ing new evidence, including these recommendations onscreening for cervical cancer from the USPSTF.
