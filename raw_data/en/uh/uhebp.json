Mission Statement The mission of the WVU SON is to lead in improving health in WV and the broader society through excellence in student -centered educational programs, research and scholarship, the compassionate practice of nursing, and service to the public and the profession. Baccalaureate of Science in Nursing (BSN) Program Description The WVU SON undergr aduate program in nursing is recognized by health care agencies as providing excellent preparation for the nursing profession. Our graduates are in great demand and enjoy a large number of career opportunities. The BSN curriculum includes courses in the humanities, social sciences, basic sciences, and nursing science. These courses are taken in conjunction with nursing clinical courses that enable students to apply their learning to actual patient, family, and community situations that warrant nursing int ervention. The curriculum has been carefully designed to equip graduates to begin professional nursing practice with patients of all ages in any health care setting where there is a position for the professional nurse at the start of their career. The prog ram also provides an excellent foundation for graduate study in nursing and in other fields . The basic (traditional) BSN program is available for high school graduates and nontraditional students who aspire to a career in nursing and can be completed in f our years at WVU's Morgantown, WVU Institute of Technology (Beckley), and WVU Potomac State (Keyser) campuses. Upon successful completion, students attain the BSN degree and are eligible to take the NCLEX -RN licensure examination . The BS/BA to BSN accelerated (fast track) program is available for the college graduate with a bachelor's degree in a field other than nursing. Following 18 months of continuous enrollment and successful completion, students attain the BSN degree and are eligible to take the NCLEX - RN licensure examination. The BS/BA to BSN program is offered at WVU in Morgantown and Bridgeport. Registered nurses can complete the BSN requirements online through a completely web -based RN to BSN program. Nursing courses for RN to BSN students are offered every semester to provide opportunity for individualized progression plans and completion of degree requirements in two to three semesters of full -time study if non -nursing courses are already completed. P art-time options are also available. The WVU SON offers in -state tuition for all students enrolled in the RN to BSN program, regardless of residency. Accreditation Information The Baccalaureate Degree Program in Nursing, Master's Degree Program in Nursin g, and Doctor of Nursing Practice Program at West Virginia University is accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education, 655 K Street, NW, Suite 750, Washington, DC 20001, 202 -887-6791 WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 6 BSN Curriculum Overview The BSN curriculum provides learning experiences that move sequentially from simple to complex, build upon previous learning, and incorporate concurrent learning from both the social and basic sciences, as well as nursing courses . There are five core competencies that provide the framework for the BSN curriculum. The core competencies include Critical Thinking, Nursing Interventions, Professional Role, Caring, and Communication. The WVU SON faculty define these competencies as: Core Competency Definition Critical Thinking Activity that reflects skills in reasoning, analysis, research, or decision making relevant to the discipline of nursing. Nursing Interventions Actions based on theoretical knowledge, skills, and professional nursing judgment in the prevention of illness and the restoration and promotion of health. Professional Role Internalization of a set of values, beliefs, and leadership behaviors relevant to the discipline of nursing and consistent with standards of nursing practice. Caring An inter -human process in which there is communication of a sincere interest and concern for well-being. Communication The exchange of information within and between systems. Core competencies include key concepts that are threaded throughout the curriculum: Core Competency Key Concepts Critical Thinking Scholarship ; Evidence -Based Reasoning Nursing Interventions Safety and Quality ; Patient Care Technology ; Health Promotion/Disease Prevention ; Health Restoration and Maintenance Professional Role Professionalism ; Organization and Systems Leadership ; Health care Policy , Finance, and Regulation Caring Cultural Sensitivity ; Ethics ; Empathy ; Compassion Communication Information Management ; Professional and Therapeutic Communication The core competencies are reflected in the program outcomes, with each core competency having a program outcome. Each level of the curriculum (freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior) has a level outcome for each of the key concepts. Attainment of course learning outcomes collectiv ely lead to the attainment of level outcomes for each of the key concepts. While core competencies are reflected in each nursing course's learning outcomes, key concepts are included in all levels but not necessarily each course.

Clinical assignments are designed to enrich course work and differ from pre -licensure clinical assignments. The purpose of these clinical experiences is to advance professional growth and assist students in demonstrating proficiencies essential to BSN - prepared nursing practice. Clinical experiences include assessing and providing interventions for individuals, families, and communities; communicating and collaborating in an inter -professional manner; and designing and disseminating an evidenced -based nursing practice plan to address a health issue or problem in a community or acute care setting. Degree requirements for RN to BSN students can be confusing. RN to BSN students are encouraged to meet regularly with their advisor, use the following checklist, and compare it to the DegreeWorks account. Stud ents should notify the advisor the semester prior to graduation to request an internal audit and a review of readiness for graduation. It is ultimately the student's responsibility to make sure degree requirements are met. Course Age Requirements Students are permitted to continue in an undergraduate nursing program for a maximum of 7 years following their term of admission to the program. A course completed more than 7 years prior to the term of degree completion will be reviewed by program admini strators and the Associate Dean of Underg raduate Programs.

All courses used to earn the BS N degree in which students earn a grade of D, F, W, or WU must be repeated prior to the student's progression to the next semester in the nursing sequence. Nursing courses must be repeated in the next spring or fall semester that the course is offered. The re is an exception to this individual standard regarding nursing electives; students who receive a W in a nursing elective are not required to repeat it. 3. Repeats Students who receive a D, F, W, or WU in a course used to earn the BSN degree may repeat the course only once and must earn a minimum grade of C -. Students who repeat a course used to earn the BSN degree and earn a grade of D, F, W, or WU will be dismissed from the WVU SON . * *In the last semester of the program, students are permitted to repeat one nursing course in which a D, F, or W was received even if the student previously repeated another course and would have otherwise been dismissed. Students are not permitted t o repea t the same course twice. 4. Readmission Students who have been dismissed from the BSN or BS/BS to BSN programs are not eligible for readmission. See the readmission policy. Procedures for Unmet Academic Standards (All BSN Programs) When academic standard violations do not warrant dismissal from the program: The student meets with the advisor to discuss options and approaches to improving performance. Options will depend on the nature of the problem. Example : Insufficient GPA; grade less than C- in courses used to earn the BSN degree Examples of School and/or University resources that may be advised include the undergraduate academic counselors, peer tutoring, math/reading/writing lab, counseling center, and accessibility services. Options and appro aches presented are documented by the advisor in the students advising file. Students have the right to appeal final grades (see Appeal Policy) . When unmet academic standards result in dismissal from the program: A student dismissed from the program for failing to meet any of the above academic standards will be informed in writing by the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Programs (or designee). Students have the right to appeal such decisions (see Appeal Policy). WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 21 Leave of Absence (LOA) and Withdrawal Policies Leave of Absence Policy Students may request a leave of absence (LOA) for extenuating circumstances, such as family emergencies, military duty, parental leave, or significant changes in health status. The student is required to submit the rationale and the time period for the LOA request in writing to the program director. Additional documentation may be required to clarify the circumstances for the request. If approved by the program director and Associate Dean of Undergraduate Progra ms, the student and advisor will complete the LOA and Withdrawal Form provided by the program director or advisor upon request. The student will then be required to withdraw from all nursing courses in the current semester, if applicable. Students are encouraged to evaluate the WVU Withdrawal Policies , the financial implications of the decision, the effects of the LOA on program progression, and International Student Policies as applicable. An LOA is not equivalent to a withdrawal or a dismissal, and there are specific limitations. Students are not permitted to have more than one LOA, and each LOA is limited to one semester. If unforeseen circumstances prevent the student's return to a program following a one -semester LOA, the student may request a one -semester extension. Additional LOAs and extensions are only granted in extreme circumstances. If a student is on an approved LOA, it is the student's responsibility to notify the advisor to schedule classes for the semester following the LOA and to seek a review of the revised progression plan. If the LOA was due to a significant change in health status, the stud ent may be required to provide documentation from a healthcare provider that he or she is able to return to the nursing program and perform all aspects of the student role. If a student does not return to the program during the contracted semester, it will be considered a withdrawal, and the student will not be eligible for readmission. Exceptions will be granted if required courses are not offered the semester in which the student is expected to return. Retrospective LOA requests will not be accepted. Withdrawal Policy Students must be continuously enrolled in WVU SON programs to maintain active status. Summer term enrollment is only required if the student's program of study/progression plan is dependent on it for an on-time graduation. A withdrawal is defined as withdrawing from the program, withdrawing from all required courses in a semester, or failing to enroll in any given semester of the progression plan (see Summer exception above). Students who withdraw must follow up with the advisor, who will gather information about the reason for leaving and discuss associated policies. Students who wish to return must follow the LOA policy in order to be eligible for continuation in the program. Students who do not follow this process will not be eligible for continuation or readmission at a later date. WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 22 Transient Credit Policy & Procedures Students must have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.0 or better to be eligible to enroll for courses at another institution as a transient student. Students are strongly discouraged from taking transient work during the semester in which they expect to graduate. Transient work in the final semester may delay graduation due to possible delays in receiving transcripts from other institutions. I t is the student's responsibility to have an official transcript sent to the WVU Office of Admissions at the completion of each semester in which transient work is completed. Procedures : 1. Students wishing to take a course at an institution other than WVU must complete an Undergraduate Transient Application prior to enrolling for the course. The form is available from the Office of Student Services or any Admissions Office. 2. The student should obtain a schedule of courses from the college of choice. Course descriptions should also be obtained from the college if a catalog is not available. 3. Students should review the possible choices with their advisor who will review the advising folder to validate that the chosen course meets the student' s academic progress ion needs. 4. The advisor will complete the current GPA blank on the application and validate that the rest of the form is complete. No more than one school may be listed on a form and the address for the chosen school must be complete. 5. The advisor signs and dates the form and forwards it to the Student Services Office for the Dean's signature. 6. A copy of the form is placed in the student's advising folder and the original is forwarded to the Office of Admissions. 7. Students must arrange to be admitted and enrolled at the institution where they will be taking the course. Remember to take ONLY the course(s) that have been approved. If students wish to take other courses, they must get permission from their advisor and complete another form.

WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 24 Absence from ATI exams Make -up dates will not be scheduled for ATI exams. If the student misses Test 1, the student will earn 0 points and will take the test on the retest date. Scoring on the retest will be: o Level 3 score = 10/10 points o Level 2 score = 9/10 points o Level 1 or below= 0 points If the student is required to retest because of the Test 1 score and misses the retest, the score from Test 1 will be the ATI test score earned for the course. Study for success plan for students with ATI Level 1 and below : For the ticket to retest, students must follow the steps below: 1. Go to the Academic Counseling/ATI Success Plan site on SOLE. 2. Print out the rubric for the required portfolio. 3. Print out the proctored ATI test results from their ATI account. Within 3 -5 days of taking the first ATI proctored test, students should: 1. Complete the ATI Focused Review (directions found on ATI site). Evidence should show that students have spent a minimum of 30 minutes using the focused review. 2. Complete the Success Plan portfolio using the rubric. 3. Take the completed Success Plan portfolio and a screen shot of time spend on the focused review to the remediation session led by the Academic Counselor on the student's respective campus. The dates of the remediation sessions will be posted on the Academic Counseling/ATI Su ccess Plan SOLE site. The session will be approximately 45 -50 minutes in length. WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 25 Program Policies (All BSN Programs) Academic Integrity Statement It is the desire of the WVU SON faculty to create and foster a positive learning environment that promotes professionalism, integrity, and mutual trust. Nursing students are expected to act with integrity and honesty in all didactic and clinical settings, regardless of the nature of the assignment or activity or percentage weight toward course grade. For example, the WVU SON places as high an expectation on academic integrity for quizzes and short discussion board writing submissions as it does for exams or end -of-semester papers. All forms of academic dishonesty are prohibited. Th e WVU SON follows the WVU Policy on Student Academic Integrity . Formal complaints of academic dishonesty shall be filed with the Director of Academic Integrity by any Authorized Reporter (typically the Instructor of Record). Complaints should be submitted to the Director of Academic Integrity within ten (10) academic days following the discovery of the alleged incident of academic dishonesty. Academic dishonesty sanctio ns may range from remedial/educational sanctions to university expulsion. The comprehensive Academic Integrity policy, process, and list of sanctions can be found in the WVU Policy on Student Academic Integrity . Appeal Policies (Final Grades, Academic Penalties, and Academic Dishonesty Charges) The primary purpose of the appeal procedure is to allow review of a penalty or sanction in cases in which a student believes tha t due process was not followed or that the penalty or sanction was imposed unfairly or inconsistently with regard to course requirements and policies , or with program and University standards and regulations. Students have the right to appeal a final grade, academic penalty, or charge of academic dishonesty that they believe reflects a capricious, arbitrary, or prejudiced academic evaluation or reflects discrimination based on race, gender, age, disability , veteran status, religion or creed, sexual ori entation, color, or national origin. Additional grounds for appeal may include unreasonable severity penalty, demonstrable prejudice in the decision -making process, a belief that the evidence does not support the finding of responsibility (in the case of a cademic dishonesty) or the choice of penalty, or additional evidence or new information that was not considered in determining the penalty. If a student does not appeal an academic penalty or fails to follow the appeal procedures described below, the academic penalty will be upheld. Appeal of a Final Grade For WVU SON , the Level 1 appeal should be submitted through WVU email to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Programs , and Level 2 appeals are submitted to the Dean. Please refer to the WVU Policy for Appeal of a Final Grade for more information. Appeal of an Academic Penalty Students may also appeal academic penalties other than a final grade, such as admissions decisions, program dismissals, academic notice , or progression policy penalties. This type of appeal is not used for academic dishonesty cases. Please refer to the WVU Policy for Appeal of an Academic Penalty for additional information. In the WVU SON , the Committee for Academic and Professional Standards (CAPS) presides over the Level 1 appeal . The letter of appeal should be submitted through WVU email to the Associate Dean of Undergraduate Programs , who will forward the appeal to the committee chairperson. Level 2 appeals are submitted through WVU email to the Dean. Appeal of a Charge and/or Penalty Based on Academic Dishonesty A student who has been found responsible for violating the WVU Policy on Student Academic Integrity may initiate an WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 26 appeal by submitting a written appeal following the instructions provided in the notice of outcome. The student must file an appeal within 1 0 academic days from the date the outcome letter is sent. If no appeal is submitted within that time frame, the sanction(s) will be applied, no appeal will be considered, and the matter will be concluded. The student's appeal must include the documentation and evidence forming the basis of their appeal, and must be based on one or more of the recognized grounds for appeal listed in the WVU Policy on Student Academic Integr ity. The student may appeal the finding of responsibility, the sanction(s), or both. The Office of Academic Integrity must provide all relevant documentation to the Provost upon their request. The Provost assesses the available evidence and makes a decisio n about the appeal based on that evidence. The sanction(s) under review may be upheld, lessened, or dismissed entirely, but not aggravated, by the Provost. The Provost communicates the decision in writing via WVU e -mail to the student and other individuals or committees that have been involved in the charge or appeal to that point. The Office of Academic Integrity retains all documentation related to the appeal for 5 years. Once the Provost has issued a decision, the matter is final and binding upon all inv olved. SON Professional Standards Policy All students of the University and, to the extent applicable, all student organizations are expected and required to obey federal, state, and local laws, to comply with the policies of the West Virginia University Board of Governors (WVU BOG) , with institutional or campus rules and regulations, with directives issued by any University official, and to observe standards of conduct appropriate for an academic institution. Any alleged violation to the Campus Student Code will be reported to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities . In addition, all students in the WVU SON are expected to uphold and demonstrate professional and personal moral standards as defined and described in the following documents: West Virginia Code and Legislative Rules; Section 30 -7 and Title 19 American Nurses Association Standards of Practice American Nurses Association Code for Professional Nurses American Nurses Associat ion Code of Ethics Students are expected to practice with responsibility and accountability as a professional nursing student. The ultimate goal of nursing practice is to promote health while preventing harm to others. The WVU SON believes that this goal wil l be attained if the student's daily nursing practice is guided by the Standards of Professional Practice. These standards reflect minimum acceptable professional conduct. The role of the professional nurse involves demonstrating attitudes, values, and beh aviors consistent with professional nursing practice. Behavior in conflict with professional nursing practice is inconsistent with professionalism and will not be tolerated. Unprofessional behaviors consist of actions that do not demonstrate the minimum be haviors described as acceptable nursing practice. Incidents may be a single event or a pattern of behaviors. Professional Standards include, but are not limited to: i. Maintain professional integrity, ii. Practice within boundaries of the nursing student role, iii. Comply with the policies and procedures of the WVU SON, course syllabi, the clinical agency, and the West Virginia RN Board (WVBON) , iv. Demonstrate behaviors consistent with expectations outlined by the five core competencies (Critical Thinking, Nursing Interve ntions, Professionalism, Caring, and Communication), and v. Maintain patient privacy and confidentiality at all times. The WVBON requires that the program report misdemeanors or felonies and that applicants for licensure undergo a criminal background check a nd provide an explanation of any criminal incident. Depending on the Board's action, applicants for licensure may be barred from taking the NCLEX -RN, disciplinary action may be applied, and/or the WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 27 nursing license may be restricted. An active, unencumbered nursing license is required to remain in some WVU SON programs. Professional Standards and Program Outcomes One of the five core competencies reflected in WVU SON program outcomes is Professional Role. Students are expected to demonstrate knowledge, atti tudes, professional values, personal qualities, and behaviors consistent with the nursing role. Therefore, there is tangible link between professional role and academic achievement. Students who violate WVU SON professional standards and/or policies outsid e the purview of the Campus Student Code may receive a grade reduction in the clinical assignment column of the associated course. Violations of WVU SON professional standards and/or policies unrelated to clinical experiences will be reviewed on an individual basis. Any violation that could potentially alter progression through immediate course failure, program dismissal, or university expulsion will be referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities . Clinical Attendance Policy Attendance is required for all clinical experiences. A clinical experience is defined as a skills lab, clinical small group, comprehensive skills testing (comps), simulation experience, IPE experience, hospital experience, preceptorship, or any other experience identified as clinical in nature. These experiences are integral to outcome achievement and the demonstration of professionalism and accountability in the nursing program. Nursing faculty understand that extenuating circumstances outside the student's control occur, and students seeking an excused absence are required to submit a written request to the BSN Program Director. Excused ab sences are only approved in the presence of extenuating circumstances (illness, hospitalization, accident, death in the family, etc.) or University -approved absences (military duty, jury duty, and approved WVU athletic events). Documentation supporting the extenuating circumstances may be required with the request, and students must notify clinical faculty and preceptors ahead of time (unless emergent in nature) in order to be considered for an excuse. See the Request for Excused Clinical Absence Form in Appendix A. Each semester, t he first unexcused clinical absence will result in a written notice. Any additional unexcused clinical absences will result in an automatic 5% grade reduction in the clinical assignment column of the associated course where the s econd or subsequent absence occurred. Clinical assignment grade reductions are not to exceed 10% in a given course. Students who fall below the required 77% clinical assignment column average and/or do not meet all clinical behaviors will fail the clinical component of the course. If a student is more than one hour late for clinical, the student will be sent home, it will be counted as a missed clinical experience, and this policy will apply. Students sent home for uncorrectable dress code violations, lack of preparedness, or any other violation of professional conduct will incur the clinical absence. Students who receive approval for extenuating circumstances may be required to complete assignments or activities that address the clinical outcomes at the d iscretion of course faculty. However, virtual, or alternative assignments may not exceed 25% of the total clinical time in the course. There will be no opportunities for makeup clinical experiences in the clinical facilities because of resource limitations, schedule conflicts, and limits on clinical g roup size. Students that have ex cused clinical absences will have a reduction in the corresponding number of hours of any enhancement clinical rotations (NICU, PICU, PACU, cardiac cath ., dialysis, cancer center, etc.). Students who are ill should contact clinical faculty prior to the scheduled experience to determine if they should stay home from clinical. Students who do not contact clinical faculty and go to clinical experiences with signs of infectious or severe illness will be sent home, will be counte d absent, and will be required to request exemption as described above. In most courses that utilize preceptorships, students arrange a clinical schedule with the preceptor. Students are not permitted to change the clinical schedule after the established d eadline unless initiated by the preceptor. Any clinical absence or change in schedule will apply to this policy. Students should take this policy and the course WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 28 calendar into consideration when establishing the schedule. Even in the case of approved exten uating circumstances, faculty will evaluate the student's ability to achieve clinical outcomes, and those absences can still result in an unsatisfactory clinical grade. The clinical evaluation tool and the number of absences will be the guide for the deter mination of the achievement of clinical outcomes. Students with repeated absences due to extended illnesses or extenuating circumstances should consult program administration regarding options. Note: In the event of extreme weather, students are required to follow the inclement weather policy, and this attendance policy would not apply. Students will still need to notify faculty if they expect to be tardy or absent due to weather. Dress Code - Policy for Professional Appearance Health Sciences students, staff, and practitioners are required to place a high value on professional appearance, including attire. This document sets forth standards for dress and appearance necessary to meet the service and safety objectives of placing p atient welfare first and the educational objectives of preparing the student to assume the role of a professional healthcare provider . The guidelines are established to include those required by all clinical agencies used by the WVU SON for clinical experi ences. The following guidelines help prepare the student to establish a successful caregiver -patient relationship. These guidelines address classroom and clinical experiences. Please note that if the dress code for a particular agency differs from that of the WVU SON, the most stringent or conservative guidelines take precedence. Classroom and Event Expectations The following guidelines apply for all WVU SON classes and sponsored activities, such as award ceremonies and sanctioned or community events where the student is representing the WVU SON : Business casual attire is expected for all WVU SON events unless otherwise instructed by the event planner. Good personal hygiene is to be maintaine d at all times. This includes regular bathing , use of deodorants or antiperspirants, regular dental hygiene, and regular laundering of clothes. All attire, including personal property and laptops, must be free from potentially offensive text or graphics. In the classroom setting, the following should not be worn: o Denim with holes/rips above the knee . o Shorts/skirts/dresses above mid -thigh length . o Translucent r transparent tops/bottoms, tank tops/'cut offs', and midriff, halter, or other tops with plunging necklines. Clinical Expectations (including simulation and skills lab): When patient contact or simulated clinical activities are part of the educational experience, students are expected to dress professionally. This includes instances of actual patient encounters in the hospital and other clinical sites, preplanning activities at clinical sites, simulation lab experiences, and skills lab activities. This means that if a student is leaving to preplan directly from class, they may need to change clothing to meet the clinical expectations. There may be specific clinical settings where alterations of this policy may be necessary through the approval of the faculty and program director. General Standards WVU Health Sciences Center (HSC) /Campus name tags or badges worn at all times . Avoid scented lotions, perfumes , and colognes . WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 29 Hair maintenance Hair should be restrained off the face , out of the eyes , and neatly secured off the neck .

A WVU SON -approved scrub uniform (navy pants and navy top) that is clean, neat, without stains or wrinkles, and smoke free is required for all clinical nursing experiences, simulations, and skills labs. Some clinical experiences may require different clinical attire, and instructors will outline requirements. o Uniform skirt length must touch the knee, and the fit must be modest and allow for comfortable ease of movement. o Lab coats or solid white/navy /black long sleeve undershirt s may be worn with the uniform. Only WVU SON -approved navy pullover s/jackets /vests can be worn over the uniform. o In the interest of infection control, it is recommended that students refrain from wearing clinical attire in public places for non -clinical activities . Hospital -provided scrubs : o These are to be worn in specific patient care areas only (e.g., OR, PAR, BMTU). o They are the property of the hospital and are not to be defaced, altered, or removed from the hospital. o If a scrub suit must be worn outside these areas (e.g., to the cafeteria), it must be clean and then covered with a clean lab coat. Shoe covers, masks, and hair covers must be removed before leaving the clinical area. o Stained or soiled scrub suits must be changed as soon as possible. WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 30 Community Service Requirements Definition of Community Service A method under which students actively participate in organized service that is conducted in and meets the needs of community. It is monitored by their program/school at the WVU HSC and the community/agency representative. This service activity helps foster civic responsibility and may be integrated into and enhance the academic curriculum of the students. Learning Objectives : 1. To foster civic responsibility . 2. To enhance hands on learning experiences . 3. To assist in identifying and meeting health and social needs of the community . Requirements Community service is required of all Health Science s students, including part-time and full-time undergraduate students. Community service hours must be done in a variety of settings, and students are not required to complete them through WVU. Generally, no more than 25 hours can be counted per activity. Com munity service activities can only be counted for credit once. Community service hour requirements are as follows: Traditional BSN: 100 hours BS/BA to BSN: 50 hours RN to BSN: 25 hours Students may visit WVU iServe for other opportunities . Note: N ot all iServe options meet School of Nursing criteria for community service. Note: Monetary donation or donations of any type are not an acceptable method of community service and has no hourly value. Procedures : 1. The student completes the community service under appropriate supervision. 2. A person in the community must sign-off indicating that the service was performed satisfactorily. 3. The student enters the community service hours in SOLE . 4. The Office of Student Services (Morgantown Campus), Program Director (RN to BSN ) or Department Chairs (Keyser, Beckley, or Bridgeport Campus) record approval in SOLE. Interprofessional Education (IPE) requirements All students in the HSC and WVU SON are required to participate in IPE activities. IPE activities may be offered as part of a nursing course or as a community service activity arranged by the WVU HSC Office of IPE. PreCheck/SentryMD Documentation Policy All students must submit and verify app roval of immunizations, immunity, compliance with clinical requirements, and other important documentation in order to safeguard themselves and protect patients in the clinical setting. Students are required to purchase a PreCheck/SentryMD account, and the student is responsible for maintaining the current information in the PreCheck/SentryMD account, including items that must be maintained continuously or that expire as outlined below. Students are responsible for checking all relevant email accounts (requ ired to use mix email account) to verify that the submission was approved. If there are any unresolved issues or extenuating circumstances, it is the student's responsibility to contact PreCheck/SentryMD and/or the program director prior to WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 31 the deadline. Students must exhibit compliance prior to the beginning of each semester (Jan. 1 for spring, May 1 for summer, and Aug. 1 for fall). Students noncompliant on the first day of classes each semester will only have the add/drop week to remedy documentation errors. Students still noncompliant by 4pm on Friday of the first week of classes will not be permitted to attend clinical experiences and the Clinical Attendance Policy will apply. RN-BSN: All RN to BSN students are required to have an active, unencumber ed RN license for admission to the RN - BSN Program. The license can be in any state but must be maintained throughout the program in the state in which the student engages in clinical activities. New graduates of accredited associate degree or diploma nurs ing programs that have not yet passed the NCLEX -RN and obtained licensure may be admitted provisionally but must have an active, unencumbered RN license by the date that midterm grades are due in the first semester of enrollment. If the student does not ac hieve licensure by the deadline, they will be asked to withdraw from the program. Students entering the two -semester accelerated RN to BSN option must have an active RN license prior to the first day of classes. Students must immediately report any event o r circumstance that could impact the status of continued RN licensure. Failure to do so or allowing the license to expire w ill result in program dismissal. RN-BSN students will also be required to complete a criminal background check (upon admission), sta tement of criminal record (each semester), HIPAA training (upon admission and annually) , signed student handbook signature page (upon admission and annual ly), health insurance (upon admission), media release (upon admission), and authorization of release ( upon admission). Traditional and BS/BA to BSN : The following documents are required for admission and progression in the traditional BSN and BS/BA to BSN programs. Official documentation is from a physician, health clinic, etc., and parental written documentation of immunization records is not considered adequate. Signed student handbook signature page (upon admission and annua lly) Criminal background check (see Background Check Policy) (upon admission ) Completed Statement of Criminal Record Form (each semester) Current American Heart Association BLS CPR certification for adult, child, and infant (upon admission and before subsequent certification expiration) Urine drug screen (See Drug and Alcohol Screening Policy)(within one month prior to matric ulation and annually) * Students are required to repeat within 48 -72 hours for a 'negative dilute' result. HIPAA training completion certificate (found in SOLE) (upon admission and annually) Official documentation of tetanus and pertussis immunization within the last 10 years Official documentation of varicella vaccine (2 doses) If there is only documentation of \"history of disease,\" a varicella titer is required. If that titer is negative, documentation of 2 doses of varicella vaccine is required. Official documentation of initial immunization and booster for MMR (2 doses) Official documentation of a complete Hepatitis B series (3 doses) and positive Hepatitis B antibody titer A negative Hepatitis B antibody titer indicates lack of immunity, and a repeat series is required, followed by a repeat titer. If after 2 full series of Hep. B vaccines, the titer is still negative, the student will be considered a non -responder, and immunity will be presumed. Official documentation of a PPD within the past year, a current two-step PPD, or Quantiferon Gold test *If there is documentation of BCG vaccine or a previous positive PPD, then a serum Quantiferon Gold test will be accepted (upon admission and annuall y [if required], TB questionnaire required annually) Official documentation of an influenza vaccine (annual ly, November 1 deadline) COVID -19 vaccination documentation (required by clinical sites; students may be eligible for medical or religious exemptions) * Documentation of health insurance (University requirement) WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 32 Waivers Any student who declines immunizations for religious or other reasons is required to sign a waiver (Appendix B). Even if a waiver is signed, lack of immunization/immunity to the above communicable diseases may prevent a student from participating in required clinical experiences, and, therefore, may prevent a student from being admitted to , or progressing in, the nursing program. *Covid Vaccination Exemption All students are required to have received the primary series of COVID -19 vaccination. Requests for exemption from this requirement may be made u sing the appropriate links below: Medical . Medical exemptions are handled through the Office of Acces sibility Services (OAS) . The student must \"register\" with them through their website. Once registered, OAS will contact and work with the student to provide the necessary paperwork. Religious . All religious exemption requests are handled through the Division of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) . The student will need to upload the Religious Exemption Affidavit to their profile. Once the exemption has been granted by the appropriate office, the student mu st submit the exemption to their SentryMD account for approval. Background Checks Students are required by clinical agencies to undergo federal and state criminal background checks and a urine drug screen prior to clinical experiences. Felony convictions, some serious misdemeanors, and positive drug screens may preclude participation in clinical rotations. This could, in turn, prevent the completion of clinical course requirements and completion of the nursing program or result in admission ine ligibility or program dismissal. In addition, the WVBON requires that applicants for licensure undergo a criminal background check and answer the following question: Have you EVER been convicted of a felony or a misdemeanor or pled nolo contendere to any crime, had record expunged or been pardoned? An application that indicates a criminal history is considered a non -routine application and must be reviewed by the WVBON staff and possibly referred to the Board's Disciplinary Review Committee. Procedure for Criminal Background Checks : 1. Students will have a criminal background check at admission documented through PreCheck (See PreCheck/SentryMD Documentation Policy). 2. If the background check indicates a criminal history, the clinical agency will be notified and will determine whether or not to allow the student to participate in clinical experiences at that agency. 3. If the student is unable to participate in clinical experiences, the student will not be able to complete clinical course requirements, and, therefore, will not be able to meet requirements to complete the nursing program. 4. Students will be required to complete a Statement of Criminal Record form (Appendix C) each semester they are enrolled in nursing courses to indicate any changes that have oc curred related to the criminal record. 5. Students who are charged with or convicted of a crime may be subject to admission ineligibility, dismissal, suspension, or lesser disciplinary sanctions. 6. Students who experience a \"Citation\" or \"Arrest\" while enrolled in the nursing program must notify the SON Office of Student Services within 72 hours of the citation or arrest Statement of Criminal Record . WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 33 Drug & Alcohol Screening Policy The WVU SON has an obligation to protect the public and its students whi le also respecting students' privacy rights. Drug screening policies at the academic program level must balance safety and privacy rights. This drug and alcohol screening policy applies to all WVU SON programs that incorporate a clinical component, direct patient care provision, and/or handling prescription medications. In addition, the WVU SON and its students must follow clinical facility policies and requirements regarding drug and alcohol screening. Prohibited Substances Any student under the influence of drugs or alcohol during a clinical experience may pose serious safety and health risks, not only to themselves, but also to all those who work with them and to patients for whom they provide care. The unlawful possession, use, or sale of illegal drugs, prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, and/or alcohol poses an unacceptable risk for unsafe patient care. On-campus and off -campus incidents involving alcohol or prohibited substances will be referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities and may result in a violation pursuant to this policy. Prohibited substances include may not be under the influence of alcohol while performing patient care duties or handling prescription medication, and pos session or consumption of alcoholic beverages by individuals under the age of 21 is a violation of state liquor laws. Likewise, it is illegal for anyone to provide alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of 21. Students who are prescribed any substan ce that may impair their alertness or cognition while enrolled in a nursing course with a clinical component must notify their instructor as soon as possible and prior to clinical experiences, medication administration, or patient care. Students are permit ted to take prescribed medications that may affect urine drug screen results as long as the student is able to safely provide care. Nurses are not prohibited from receiving a cannabis certification from a healthcare practitioner and possession of a valid identification card issued by the Bureau for Public Health within the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources under 16A -1-1 simply by virtue of their profession; however, a cannabis certification is not considered a prescription, and consump tion is not permitted while enrolled in the nursing program. Positive drug screens, regardless of certification status, will be sanctioned as outlined in this policy. Routine Urine Drug Screening Requirements Students enrolled in programs with clinical co mponents are required to submit a urine drug screen during the month prior to matriculation and annually through PreCheck/Sentry MD ( see the PreCheck/Sentry MD Documentation Policy). Students are required to comply with clinical facility policies, which ma y include random drug screening. Reasonable Suspicion (\" For Cause\") Screening Students enrolled in courses with clinical components may be subject to additional blood alcohol testing or urine alcohol and drug screening if reasonable suspicion for screenin g is found (see Appendix D). Reasonable suspicion requires some level of objective information to believe that drugs or alcohol are involved. Reasonable suspicion of substance use may be considered in the presence of the following factors : 1. Direct observati on of the student engaging in drug or alcohol related activity 2. Direct observation of the student demonstrating symptoms of being under the influence, including, but not limited to: a. Slurred speech b. Odor of alcohol on breath or person c. Unsteady gait d. Dilated pu pils or bloodshot/glassy eyes WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 34 e. Disoriented or confused behavior f. Observed behaviors indicative of hallucinations g. Unexplained accident or injury 3. Documented pattern of erratic behavior or sudden change in demeanor 4. Conviction of an alcohol or drug related offen se 5. Documented sudden change in performance, including, but not limited to: a. Excessive absenteeism or tardiness b. Decline in academic performance, including missed deadlines c. Work habits in the clinical environment, including increased errors 6. Specific and reliable information from a credible source Following an incident that requires drug or alcohol testing, the student will be sent home via cab or rideshare (at the student's expense) or a responsible individual. Under no circumstances will the student be allowed to drive home or return to class or clinical. Urine Drug Screening Procedures Students are responsible for the cost of all drug screening. Routine drug screens are purchased and documented through PreCheck/Sentry MD. Random and \"for cause\" drug sc reening can be documented through PreCheck/Sentry MD or a participating LabCorp facility. More information regarding drug screen locations can be obtained through the Office of Student Services. Students may not be permitted to begin or return to the clin ical rotation until drug screen results are available. It is the student's responsibility to ensure that drug testing is completed in a timely manner. Positive Alcohol and Drug Screens Any positive alcohol or drug screen may result in a violation of academic program policies and professionalism standards. Refusal of a blood alcohol, urine alcohol, or urine drug screen will be treated as a positive drug screen result and repeat specimen c ollection for a positive result is prohibited. Students are required to repeat urine screenings with a 'negative dilute' result within 48-72 hours. If the student feels that a positive test result is an error, the specimen may be immediately retested by t he contracted laboratory to determine whether an error existed. In the event that the retest is negative, the immediately prior positive result will be considered an error, and the initial positive test will not result in a violation. On-campus and off -campus incidents involving alcohol or prohibited substances will be referred to the Office of Student Rights and Responsibilities and may result in a violation pursuant to this policy. Interim suspension measures or an immediate leave of absence may be necessary during the investigation and/or during follow -up treatment and support. Required documentation will be outlined in a formal outcome letter and will be maintained with the student's academic progra m record. The WVU SON recognizes that chemical dependency is an illness that can be treated. Assistance for students who are dependent on a chemical substance is available through WVU and WV Restore , and any s anction regarding a violation of this policy will result in a WV Restore referral. If, through disciplinary proceedings and the resulting sanctions, the student is permitted to return to the academic program, full compliance with the recommendations of the counseling/support program will be required. Under the University's Campus Student Code and WV law , bystanders and those affected by drug or alcohol overdose may be safe from prose cution and may not face charges if they seek medical assistance in an emergency. WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 35 Health Insurance Students are required to have health insurance while they are enrolled in the WVU SON . Health insurance is available through the WVU Student Insurance Office . WVU's first priority is its students. We want them to be healthy, happy, and successful in and out of the classroom. In order to ensure that our students have ac cess to the quality healthcare and as a measure to protect them from high, unexpected healthcare costs, all domestic students at WVU and WVU Tech, enrolled in 6 or more credit hours and international students enrolled in 1 or more credit hours are required to carry health insurance coverage. This decision was made with great care by our Student Health Advisory Committee. Eligible students who do not have an approved waiver on file for the academic year are automatically enrolled in the WVU -sponsored Aetna s tudent health insurance plan. Nursing students on the Keyser campus will be directed as to their insurance requirements. A copy of the front and back of your insurance card is to be uploaded to your Medical Document Manager in PreCheck/SentryMD to meet thi s requirement. HIPAA Training Requirement All students enrolled in the WVU SON are required to provide verification of completed annual training on the Federal Law - Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). Information on training ava ilable on SOLE can be found in the PreCheck/SentryMD portal. Upon completion of training, the form for the requirement must be downloaded, signed, and uploaded to PreCheck/SentryMD by the required due date in order to be eligible to begin the clinical expe rience. In addition to HIPAA training on SOLE, students will be required to submit signed HIPAA documents for WVU Medicine and other clinical facilities. Blood and Bodily Fluids Exposure Policy An exposure incident is defined as follows: Injury with a contaminated sharp object (e.g., needle -stick, scalpel -cut) Spills or splashes of blood or other potentially infectious material onto non-intact skin (e.g., cuts, hangnails, dermatitis, abrasions, chapped skin) or onto a mucous membrane (e.g., mouth, nose, eye) If a student has an exposure to blood/bodily fluids as described above, the student must first wash the injury site with soap and water, and immediately notify the faculty or preceptor. Weekday Exposures Between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. all WVU employees and students who have or may have been exposed to needle -sticks or other incidents involving blood or body fluid or clinical -related injury, must immediately report the incident to Employee Health at Ruby Memorial Hospital or the assigne d clinical facility. Students who experience a non-patient related health event/injury must complete an Incident Form (facility and SON) and report to the Emergency Department (at the discretion of the clinical faculty). Students may be responsible for cos ts associated with exposure/injury testing and treatment. If another person (the source person) is involved in the exposure incident, this individual must be evaluated and strongly encouraged to proceed immediately to the third floor of the Physician's Office Center (POC) or other indicated department appropriate for the facility and campus for the appropriate laboratory tests. If the source person is a patient , appropriate testing will be done per clinical facility policy. Students experiencing an expo sure or injury outside the clinical site must notify the agency preceptor and WVU SON faculty of the exposure or injury and be treated according to the agency protocol. Students may be responsible for costs associated with testing and/or treatment. WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 36 Off Hours Exposures After 4:45 p.m. or during weekends and holidays, students or WVU employees must go immediately to the Emergency Department/Trauma Center of WVU Hospital or other facility or campus department for medical evaluation. If another person (the source person) is involved in the exposure incident, this individual must also go immediately to the Emergency Department/Trauma Center of WVU Hospital for medical evaluation. If the source person is a patient , appropriate testing will be done per clinical facility policy. NOTE: All nursing students are required to participate in Bloodborne Pathogens training prior to clinical experiences. Students on the Charleston, Keyser, Beckley, and Bridgeport Campuses will follow this policy as applicable but will also follow specific procedures directed by the clinical instructor/site. Orientation (Mandatory) All undergraduate students (BSN, BS/BA to BSN, and RN -BSN) are required to complete a program orientation. Laptop Program All traditional BSN and BS/BA to BSN students admitted to the Morgantown campus will be issued a laptop computer and will be enrolled in the WVU HSC Student Computer Program. All BSN students admitted to distant campuses will be enrolled in the mandatory laptop programs on their campus. S tudents are required to review the Student Computer Policies and Procedures Manual for the program and accept the Student Computer Program Terms by logging into SOLE prior to receiving their laptop. Refer to the specific campus onboarding SOLE sites for de tails and minimal specifications for each campus. Duo -Token Policy The use of two -factor authentication for access to secure, targeted websites from all HSC campuses, including HSC offices, labs, offsite locations and WVU Medicine hospitals/clinics is required. This is to ensure uniformity across all WVU campuses. WVU's academic administrators determined that for this critical security initiative to succeed, no group of people and no physical location should be exempt. All HSC classrooms require the use of two- factor authentication. To ensure a secure testing area, students will not be permitted to use their smartphones in the classroom to access the two -factor authentication app. Duo Token and generation of bypass code options are available for use through the WVU and HSC Bookstores. Additional information regarding dual authentication can be found through WVU IT . Online Participation Policy Students in online courses have the professional responsibility to devote their full attention to the class while it is in session, just as they would in a traditional classroom setting. Students may not attend an online class session while responsible for patient care in the workplace or while driving . If a student is permitted by an employer to participate in an online course during working hours, they must do so away from the clinical setting and only after being completely relieved of patient responsibilities. Students will not be pe rmitted to make up course work or testing that is missed if called back to the workplace. Email Communication s Students should use their WVU mix account for all email communication. Students are expected to check their email frequently (including spam folders ) and review all communication from the WVU SON. When initiating emails or sending a response, professional standards should apply. WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 37 Social Media Policy WVU is co mmitted to free and open expression and supports its faculty, staff, and students in the use of social media to connect with each other and to accelerate teaching and learning. Social media is a powerful tool that carries with it many rewards, but with tho se rewards come personal and institutional risks. The University has developed these guidelines to assist the University community in the safe, legal, and effective use of blogs, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn, Foursquare, and other social media outl ets, and to protect users' personal and professional reputations and the institutional reputation of the University. Because technology evolves constantly, these Guidelines will be monitored and revised as deemed necessary. General Guidelines: 1. Use of social media must comply with all applicable University policies, guidelines, and regulations, including but not limited to: Board of Governors policies, Division of Human Resources policies, Administration and Finance policies, and University Relations an d Information Technology Services standards and procedures. 2. All use of technology resources must comply with the Information Technology Services Acceptable Use of Data and Technology Resources Policy . 3. Users must not post confidential information about West Virginia University, its faculty, staff, or students. Faculty, employees, and students at the West Virginia University Robert C. Byrd HSC also must abide by the HSC Information Technology S ervices Guidelines , which contain vital information relating to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). Violation/ Breach of HIPAA may result in immediate dismissal from the School of Nursing. 4. Content managers must follow a ll WCAG 2.0 and 508 Compliance recommendations including captioning of all videos with correct spelling and grammar as well as other accessibility guidelines including alt tags for graphics. If a video is not transcribed by another group, it should not be shared. Cell phones, laptops, and any devices with ringtones or other audible notifications must be silenced when in the classroom, workshop, or clinical area. Students may not accept or access personal cell phone calls or text messaging in the direct pat ient care or simulation area. Students must adhere and will be subject to WVU SON and clinical institution policies regarding cell phone use and social media activity. Student Workload Policy A student enrolled in the WVU SON is expected to give priority to the demands of the required classroom and clinical experiences. This includes adequate study and preparation time. Time spent working can interfere with the time needed for these requirements. Therefore, the WVU SON strongly discourages undergraduate nursing students from working in excess of 20 hours per week when enrolled for 12 or more credit hours. As the number of enrolled credit hours increases above 12, the number of hours worked should decrease below 20. If a student chooses to work, the hours worked are not an excuse for failing to meet academic and clinical performance standards and schedules. Students may not work a shift immediately prior to reporting for clinical rotations. Students are encouraged to take advantage of all opportunities for financial aid, including grants, scholarships, and educational loans, to reduce and/or eliminate the need to seek employment while enrolled in the WVU SON . WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 38 Academic Advising Guidelines Philosophy of Advising Students enter the WVU SON with varied backgrounds and motivating factors. To maintain the standards of the school and to serve the best interest of each student, academic advising by professional advisors or faculty is provided for every semester of enrol lment. The Office of Student Services is responsible for management of those processes related to admission, progression, and graduation of students, including the advising process. Purpose of Advising The purpose of academic advising is to assist the student in their academic progression during the period of student enrollment. Assumptions and Beliefs The following assumptions and beliefs about advising are important to the academic advising process at WVU SON : The assigned academic advisor or a member of the Student Services Office staff provides academic advising. Advising about non-academic concerns shall be provided ONLY by mutual agreement between the student and the advisor. Advising is characterized by collaboration between advisor and advisee in exploration and selection of alternatives in meeting student's academic needs. It is believed that the student -advisor relationship benefits the student because the relationship: Helps in the development of the student as an individual. Motivates the student through expression of individual needs. Maintains continuity of advising. Helps in obtaining academic goals through an understanding attitude. Allows the student to receive practical advice and/or professional advice. Provides an advocate for the student within the academic system. Assists in making employment contacts after the student has graduated. Assists the advisor in writing letters of recommendation. Requirements : Students are required to meet with the advisor every semester prior to registering for courses for the subsequent semester. Students must meet with the advisor during the final semester before graduation in order to complete the Senior Reference form. Students may also meet with the advisor as needed. Student Services Guidelines The official student record is maintained electronically through the Office of Student Services Advisors are responsible for providing documentation of student contacts for the file, generally in the DegreeWorks program. All forms pertaining to students must be processed through or copied to the Office of Student Services (e.g., LOA, grade modifications, applications for graduation, etc.). A student's address, e-mail, or telephone numbers are not to be released outside the WVU SON without the student's permission (see FERPA policy). WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 39 General Program and Student Services Information Student Services Support Staff Contact Information Mr. Gregg Cave, Assistant Dean for Student and Alumni Services gregg.cave@hsc.wvu.edu (304) 293 -8325 Mr. Julien Nguyen, Director of Student Success julian.nguyen@hsc.wvu.edu (304) 293 -1598 Graduati ng with Honors Students who meet University and WVU SON requirements for graduation will be considered for honors designation under the following approved University policies: GPA for honors is based on all baccalaureate -level college work attempted through the next to the last semester or through the last seme ster, whichever GPA is higher. This includes transferable baccalaureate -level college work attempted at all regionally accredited higher education institutions. Credit hours with a grade of HP, P, or S are not considered. Additionally, the GPA on WVU work must meet the requirements stated for the level of honors designated. If the WVU GPA indicates a lower level of honors, the WVU GPA will determine the level of honors. Technical / Functional Standards The WVU SON is committed to DEI in the educational preparation of healthcare professionals. WVU SON personnel strive to provide quality opportunities to students with disabilities in accordance with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act. WVU OAS, WVU SON personnel, and clinical agencies collaborate with students with disabilities regarding options available for academic and nonacademic accommodations. Students are not required to disclose their disability; however, registration with WVU OAS is required to seek reasonable accommodations. Students seek ing academic or nonacademic accommodations should contact WVU OAS . Students will be required to meet program outcomes, clinical facility requirements, WV state code for nursing programs, and the following technical standards independently with or without reasonable accommodations. It is recommended that students report any potential issues regarding meeting these outcomes at the time of admission to avoid problems with clinical placement and progr ession in nursing courses. Students cannot attend clinical if there are limitations in the ability to safely provide care to assigned patients. Students are encouraged to reach out to OAS or program administrators if they are unsure whether or not they hav e a qualified disability or are able to meet the technical standards. Reasonable accommodations cannot be implemented retroactively. If any change occurs in the student's ability to perform these skills, whether temporary or permanent, the BSN Program Dire ctor must be notified. The student may be required to provide documentation from a health care provider, noting any restrictions or necessary accommodations.

Students enrolling at other sites pay the fees shown in the catalog for that site. Fees are subject to change without notice. Students' expenses vary widely according to the course of study and individual needs. Students are expect ed to provide their own transportation, equipment, and instruments for the clinical courses. Specific immunizations, including hepatitis B, are required. Initial onboarding requirements, uniforms , and equipment can cost up to $500. 00. Information concerning financial assistance and application forms may be obtained by visiting the HSC Financial Aid Office , Housing and Residence Life , or Student Life . WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 41 Clinical Schedules and Transportation Courses at all levels of the nursing program include a clinical component. The clinical experiences may be during the day or the evening. Students must provi de their own transportation to clinical experiences. If there are unique circumstances related to accommodations students may submit a request to the BSN Program Director or campus Department Chair, however t here is no guarantee that request s can be honored. Students are encouraged to coordinate ride sharing with their peers as applicable. In the senior year community and leadership clinical settings, student assignments may be as far as 1.5 hours away from campus. Students are assigned to cli nical days by course coordinators and academic leadership . If personal circumstances require that students have specific clinical days, they may negotiate a clinical day trade with another student, only after approval of the course coordinator . Both studen ts must meet with the coordinator to obtain permission for the trade. No student may request remuneration for \"trading\" a clinical day assignment with another student. Financial Aid The WVU SON has scholarships available for students who may have difficulty financing their education. These nursing scholarships are awarded based on merit and need and are administered by the University's Student Financial Aid Office. WVU believes that the primary responsibility for financing education lies first with the student and their family (parents or spouse). However, when the total resources they can provide are not sufficient to meet expenses, the University as a third partner, w ill do all possible to assist so that student s will not be denied an education. In determining the amount of financial assistance student s may receive, the following are considered: 1) income, assets and resources of the student and their family , 2) support available to the student from other sources such as grants, scholarships, veterans benefits , and repayable loans , and 3) the costs reasonably necessary for full-time attendance. The Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is required b y WVU for financial aid consideration. West Virginia University Financial Aid Office Robert C. Byrd Health Sciences Center P.O. Box 9810 Morgantown, WVU Keyser Financial Aid Explore SON Scholarship Opportunities FERPA : Student Rights for Postsecondary Institutions The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. The rights are: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students should submit to the registrar, Dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will arrange for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. Studen ts should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identif ying the part WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 42 of the record they want changed and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of their right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding t he hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisor y, academic , research, or support staff position (including law enforcement , unit personnel , and health staff); a person or company with whom the University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board o f Trustees; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing their tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to revi ew an education record in order to fulfill their professional responsibility. Upon request, the University discloses education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll. [NOTE: FERPA requires an in stitution to make a reasonable attempt to notify the student of the records request unless the institution states in its annual notification that it intends to forward records on request. 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by the University to comply with the requirements of FERPA.

WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 43 Resources for Student Success Peer Student Tutor ing Peer student tutoring provides an opportunity for students who may be struggling with nursing courses or content to be tutored by a nursing student who has excelled in that course. Potential peer stude nt tutors will be identified by course faculty and will be contacted by the tutor program coordinator to determine interest in employment. Assuming availability of student tutors, tutoring opportunities can be offered for any course with the prefix NSG. Tutoring is available across all campuses and virtual sessions may be utilized. Students who have struggled with a prior nursing course or who have been placed on academic notice for GPA of less than 3.0 should be referred by their advisors. Alternatively, students can self -identify for the program if they have received a grade of 80% or lower on a test in a current course , or an overall final grade of C - in a prior nursing course (see Appendix E for Peer Tutor Request Form) The tutor will me et with the tutee at least three times per semester; but no more than weekly, for 1-2 hours . Tutors will be paid by the WVU SON ($10 per hour), and also by the tutee nursing student ($3 per session). Tutors will log tutoring time via \"clocking in and out\" of the tutor ing sessions. Tutors may conduct sessions individually or may tutor a group of no more than 3 students per session if the tutees agree to group tutoring. Tutoring sessions are arranged between the tutor and tutee and may be in person or virtual . If there are issues with scheduling conflicts or teaching/learning or communication styles that hinder the tutoring process, either tutee or tutor may request an alternate \"match\" by emailing the tutor program coordinator. Tutors may use skills such as assessing the tutee's note -taking and organizational skills, time management, and test - taking skills. Tutors will also assist in summarizing or applying content of notes or instructor -provided PowerPoints , explaining content that is not understood by the tutee, suggesting review activities, posing questions for tutees to answer, or assisting with test -taking strategies. The peer tutor may share their notes with students, but may not share any completed assignments, testing materials, or test banks that the tutee does not already have access to. Tutees are to attend sessions with specific questions about content, and not expect a re -teach of the material. Other resources may be suggested by the course instructor. Procedure s: Potential student tutors will be identified by course coordinators and contacted by the tutoring coordinator to determine interest in employment. Student tutors will be employed on an hourly basis by the WVU SON and will be required to clock their tutor time for payment. Tutors will b e required to sign the peer tutor contract. Students interested in being assigned a tutor will first meet with their course coordinator to maximize course -specific strategies for success. The student then completes the Peer Tutor Request Form and emails the form to the Coordinator for the Peer Tutoring Program. The Program Coordinator will email the qualified applicant and the course tutor to make connection between the two. The t utee and tutor should meet at least three times over the semester and can meet as often as weekly for 1-2 hours. Tutors may meet with up to 3 tutees at a time if agreed upon by all parties . If tutoring occurs in a group, tutors will be paid the hourly rate by the WVU SON but will receive the tutee payment from each tutee ($3 per session). Tutors should limit their tutoring time to 15 hours per week or less. WVU SON Undergraduate Handbook AY 23 -24 44 Sigma Honor Society Sigma is the International Honor Society for nursing.
