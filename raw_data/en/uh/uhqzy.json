Covid-19 has been declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization and the world is scrambling to find a cure to it. While health experts all over the world are trying to fight this disease, we all as individuals need to take steps to protect ourselves by boosting our immunity and move towards a healthy and holistic lifestyle. At [Aahana Resort](https://www.aahanaresort.com/) we believe that a healthy lifestyle can be achieved by a combination of right and fresh food, exercise, good sleep and mental wellbeing. In times like these we all need to take care of ourselves and try to follow some basic guidelines to boost our immunity and stay fit. 1) Eat Right to Develop a Healthy Immunity System. Eating right is the first step to developing a healthy immunity system. Eat a holistic diet and try to prepare fresh food at all times. Eat a diet high in fibre (fruits and vegetables). As a country we are a powerhouse of herbs, spices and medicinal plants which are found in our kitchen on daily basis. We can add some of these natural immunity supplements like Ginger (), Turmeric (), holy basil or Tulsi(), Cordifolia () to our diet. 2) Exercise Regularly to Stay Fit and Help Boost Your Immunity Exercising regularly is the key to staying fit for a long, healthy life. It improves cardiovascular health, helps lower blood pressure, helps control body weight, and protects the body against a variety of diseases. Research has shown that by regularly exercising you can increase the production of antibodies and T-cells in the body. It also helps to expel toxins from your body and increases your metabolic rate. Everyday spend some time getting your body moving. In case you plan to go for a walk or jog outdoors maintain a safe distance and don't forget to carry your mask. 3) Sleep Adequate to Boost Your Immunity While more sleep does not prevent you from getting sick, skimping on it can adversely affect your immunity system. Study shows that people who don't get quality sleep are likely to get sick after being exposed to any virus. Researchers from Germany have found that sound sleep improves immune cells known as T cells and these cells play a very important role in fighting against various viruses and infections. The optimum amount of sleep for adults is around seven to eight hours daily and for children around nine to ten hours. Give your body enough rest each day and it will do wonders in the long run. 4) Stay Hydrated to naturally eliminate toxins and Boost Your Immunity Staying hydrated helps your body naturally eliminate toxins and other bacteria that may cause any sort of illness. Avoid cold water and try drinking water at normal temperature as much as possible. For those who find it difficult to drink plain water can add a slice of lemon or berries to the water. You can also experiment with various kinds of detox water drinks. The idea is to keep the body hydrated at all times.

In addition to this staying indoors, listening to the news around the virus can be quite disheartening. One of the best ways to reduce stress is to practice meditation and pranayama. They help drastically in reducing stress and uplifting your mood. Also everyday spend some time doing things that make you happy it could be gardening, reading or simply cooking a meal. 6) Maintain and follow Good personal hygiene habits In times like these, it is crucial to not only follow good personal hygiene habits but also be extra cautious when you are moving out of the house. Wear a mask and gloves whenever you go, wash your hands with soap regularly, use an alcohol-based sanitizer, avoid close contact with strangers and follow the WHO guidelines sincerely. We understand that these testing times can be overwhelming but what we all need to do is stay strong, stay positive, take care of ourselves and our loved ones, and help others around us in whatever way we can.
