What is PCOS/ PCOD? [PCOS/PCOD](https://eliteayurveda.com/diseases/gynecology/pcos/) (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) is one of the most prevalent endocrine hormonal disorders in women, affecting up to 20% of females in their reproductive period, leading to primary or secondary infertility. PCOS in Ayurveda was associated with Aarthava Kshaya. [PCOD is a condition](https://eliteayurveda.com/blog/can-untreated-pcos-lead-to-uterine-endometrial-cancers/) in which the ovaries contain elevated levels of androgens (male hormones), in particular testosterone resulting in high levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and low levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which prohibits follicles from developing mature eggs leading to anovulatory periods and irregular menstruation. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) signs have a natural tendency to start progressively. Hormone shifts that intensify PCOS typically begin in the early young, after the first menstrual cycle. Indications can be more evident after gaining weight. Hirsutism (excessive hair development, generally in a male pattern), growth is based on the body, the calf muscles, just below the big toe on the hips, the elbows, below the navel, in between breasts and even the moustache area. Sometimes even, too, heavy eyebrows and lips. Facial fur, and/or scalp thinning. PCOS can be of two types - Symptomatic - Asymptomatic Where asymptomatic may or may not be the condition of PCOS Reasons PCOS leads to infertility: Note: Not all PCOS/PCOD conditions lead to infertility [PCOS causes infertility](https://eliteayurveda.com/blog/what-is-infertility-according-to-ayurveda/): women with This condition have different hormonal processes than average women without PCOS. It changes your internal body mechanism of producing eggs and preparing your uterus for pregnancy. Three interpretations why women with PCOS are not pregnant or why it is impossible for them to sustain pregnancy are as follows: Most of the women who have PCOS do not ovulate naturally. They have unpredictable intervals and, thus, their monthly patterns are not predictable. Since they have irregular intervals, their endometrium cannot be prepared when the egg is released. As a result, it would not help to manage pregnancy. Symptoms of PCOS: PCOS symptoms are the most common: Periods irregularity: The absence of ovulation prevents a shedding of the uterine lining every month. Any women are less than eight years a year with PCOS. Severe bleeding: The lining of the uterus is thicker than average, meaning that the intervals will be longer than usual. Growing hair: About 70 percent of these women, including back, belly and breast, develop hair on their faces and on their bodies. Hirsutism is referred to as excess hair formation. Acne: The skin can get higher than normal through male hormones, and break out in areas such as the face, chest and back. Overweight: Up to 80% of females with PCOS are significantly overweight Male-pattern baldness: Skin is finer on the scalp and falls off. Darkening of the skin: In body plugs as in the nose, on the groin, and under the breasts, dark patches of skin can occur. Headaches: The variations in hormones in some women can cause headaches. WHAT CAUSES PCOS? Pathology or Cause of The Disease: The exact reason of PCOS is unclear. Most experts agree that a variety of influences, including biology, have a part to play: High Number of Androgens. Androgens are often referred to as male hormones, although all women make small levels of androgens. Androgens are regulating the development of male traits, such as male-pattern baldness. Higher than average amounts of androgen in women can prevent ovaries from producing an egg (ovulation) during every menstrual cycle and may trigger extra hair growth and acne, two indications of PCOS. High insulin levels. Insulin is a hormone that regulates how the food you consume is converted into energy. Many women with PCOS possess insulin resistance, particularly those who are obese or overweight, have unhealthy eating patterns, don't have physical exercise, and have a family record of diabetes (usually type 2 diabetes). Insulin tolerance can lead to type 2 diabetes over time. Ayurvedic Management For PCOS Primary treatments for PCOS include: lifestyle modifications and medications. Goals of treatment may be considered under four categories: - Reduction of insulin resistance - Restoring fertility - Treatment of hirsutism or acne - Restoration and prevention of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer. Please Note: Not every female with PCOS has difficulty getting pregnant. For those who do, anovulation or abnormal ovulation is a significant cause. Other factors include changed levels of gonadotropins, hyperandrogenaemia, as well as hyperinsulinemia. Like women without PCOS, women with ovulating PCOS may be infertile due to other causes, such as tubal. Ayurveda proposes a holistic approach to addressing PCOS. Personalized therapy helps to resolve the core cause of the condition and balance the body. Ayurvedic treatment of PCOS follows the following protocols: - Ayurvedic body detoxification - Strengthening and revitalizing the reproductive system of females - The reversal of hormonal imbalance - Addressing obesity and insulin resistance Panchakarma is the initial therapy line for PCOS in ayurveda.
