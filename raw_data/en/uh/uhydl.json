The technical standards presented in this document are prerequisite, academic requirements for admission, progression, and graduation from the MCOM DPT program. Equal Access to the Morsani College of Medicine's Educational Programs The University of South Florida is committed to the principles of equitable and accessible education and to providing reasonable accommodations to students with disabilities. The USF Morsani College of Medicine, School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences endeavors to provide reasonable accommodations for otherwise qualified individuals with disabilities who apply for admission and are enrolled as medical students. Candidates with disabilities are encouraged to contact the SPTRS Office of Admissions early in the application process so that they can further direct the candidate on the USF accommodations process. It is the responsibility of a candidate with a disability, or a candidate who develops a disability, who may require accommodations to meet these technical standards, to self-disclose to USF Student Accessibility Services and request accommodations once admitted or any time during the student's enrollment in the DPT program. Detailed instructions on how to apply for accommodations through USF's Student Accessibility Services can be found [here. ](https://www.usf.edu/student-affairs/student-accessibility/clinicians/forms.aspx) Should, despite reasonable accommodation (whether the candidate chooses to use the accommodation or not), a candidate's existing or acquired disability/disabilities interfere with patient or peer safety, or otherwise impede their ability to complete MCOM's educational program and advance to graduation, residency training, or licensure, the candidate may be denied admission or may be placed on a leave of absence or dismissed from the program. Candidates will be responsible for providing or arranging transportation between their residence and locations for assigned clerkships and courses.Professional education requires that the accumulation of scientific knowledge be accompanied by the simultaneous acquisition of skills, professional attitudes and behavior. Professional school faculty members have a societal responsibility to matriculate and graduate the best possible healthcare professionals. Thus, admission to the Morsani College of Medicine, School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences has been offered to those who present the highest qualifications for the study and practice of physical therapy. The technical standards presented below are prerequisite for admission to, progression in, and graduation from the College and School. Successful completion of all courses in the DPT curriculum is required in order to develop the essential knowledge, skills and professional attributes of a competent physical therapist. Graduates of the Morsani College of Medicine's School of Physical Therapy & Rehabilitation Sciences must have the knowledge and skills to function in a broad variety of clinical situations and to render a wide spectrum of patient care. The College and School acknowledges Section 504 of the 1973 Vocational Rehabilitation Act and PL 101336, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), but asserts that certain minimum technical standards must be present in prospective candidates for admission, progression, and graduation. Technical Standards required for Admission, Progression and GraduationCandidates for the DPT degree must have aptitude, abilities, and skills in five domains: 1) observation; 2) communication; 3) clinical skills and motor function; 4) intellectual-conceptual, integrative, and cognitive skills; and 5) behavioral attributes, socials skills, and professional expectation and must continue to meet these Technical Standards throughout their enrollment. Fulfillment of the technical standards for graduation from the physical therapy program does not guarantee that a graduate will be able to fulfill the technical requirements of any specific residency program and/or clinical setting. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in these domains, but a candidate must be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner. The use of a trained intermediary would mean that a candidate's judgment must be mediated by someone else's power of selection and observation. Therefore, a trained intermediary cannot be used to assist candidates in accomplishing curricular requirements in the five domains specified above. Technical Standards - The Five Domains Candidates for the DPT degree must have aptitude, abilities, and skills in five domains: 1) observation and perception; 2) communication; 3) motor coordination and function; 4) cognition and integrative abilities; and 5) professionalism (mature and ethical conduct), and must continue to meet these Technical Standards throughout their enrollment. Technological compensation can be made for some disabilities in these domains, but a candidate must be able to perform in a reasonably independent manner.
