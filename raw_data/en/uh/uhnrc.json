Throughout the series, I provided evidence that our exposure to unwanted substances is [inevitable](https://dr-lobisco.com/cleansing-detoxifying-naturopathic-medicine-haes-safe-cosmetics/) if we eat, breathe, and move about life. The good news is that there are ways to avoid adding to our total [body burden](https://dr-lobisco.com/cleansing-detoxifying-naturopathic-medicine-haes-safe-cosmetics/) and mitigating negative effects. A compilation of these options can be found in [my](https://dr-lobisco.com/naturopathic-safe-cleanse-detox-pregnancy-bpa-chemicals/) post on staying healthy in a chemical world. First, I highlighted factors to consider before cleansing and detoxifying. Next, I offered solutions on how to make safer and more empowered purchasing decisions. Additionally, in a posted [webinar](https://dr-lobisco.com/non-toxic-diy-essential-oils-chemical-free-essential-oils-home/) with accompanying DIY recipes and other materials, I presented several options on how to integrate essential oils into a non-toxic lifestyle. I also wrote about [five of my favorite essential oils](https://dr-lobisco.com/five-essential-oils-to-make-spring-cleaning-more-delightful-and-less-disdainful-naturopathic-medicine/) that make cleaning more green, soothe the mind and body, and enhance the many benefits and delights of springtime.

I break down the main wellness tips covered and give additional resources and fact sheets to keep one in-the-know. Moving Forward Unfortunately, I had to drudge up what we are up against to make it understandable why we must choose more wisely. Even if one has an extremely healthy diet and lifestyle, if they are bombarded with chemicals and toxins, they could be struggling and suffering with many health issues. Furthermore, not only our wellness, but our children's future, our planet's health, and our economy depend on taking into account what we consume and use on a daily basis. If you feel overwhelmed, try to take things in slow doses and doable chunks. Focus on the solutions, rather than on the problems. Use [tapping and your essential oils](https://dr-lobisco.com/naturopathic-doctor-natural-stress-relief/) to soothe the mind and brain as you make these changes.
