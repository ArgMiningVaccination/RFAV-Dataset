Sep. 2023A global experiment on motivating social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic Psychological Science Accelerator Self-Determination Theory Collaboration1,2 Edited by Douglas Massey, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ; received June 15, 2021; accepted February 20, 2022 Finding communication strategies that effectively motivate social distancing continues to be a global public health priority during the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross- country, preregistered experiment ( n=25,718 from 89 countries) tested hypotheses concerning generalizable positive and negative outcomes of social distancing messagesthat promoted personal agency and re flective choices (i.e., an autonomy-supportive message) or were restrictive and shaming (i.e., a controlling message) compared with no message at all. Results partially supported experimental hypotheses in that the control- ling message increased controlled motivation (a poorly internalized form of motivationrelying on shame, guilt, and fear of social consequences) relative to no message. On the other hand, the autonomy-supportive message lowered feelings of de ance compared with the controlling message, but the controlling message did not differ from receivingno message at all. Unexpectedly, messages did not in fluence autonomous motivation (a highly internalized form of motivation relying on one 's core values) or behavioral inten- tions. Results supported hypothesized associations between people 'se x i s t i n ga u t o n o - mous and controlled motivations and self-reported behavioral intentions to engage insocial distancing. Controlled motivation was associated with more de ance and less long-term behavioral intention to engage in social distancing, whereas autonomous motivation was associated with less de ance and more short- and long-term intentions to social distance. Overall, this work highlights the potential harm of using shaming and pressuring language in public health communication, with implications for the current and future global health challenges. behavior change jmotivation jhealth communication jCOVID-19 jself-determination theory The New Zealand government 's team opted to take a different route, focusing on the impact on people 's daily lives and steps they could take to protect each other ...The messaging was overwhelmingly positive in tone, giving \"dos\" rather than \"don'ts\"as well as reasons why .

During the rst year of the pandemic, New Zealand emerged as an example of a country that successfully mitigated the spread ofCOVID-19, which may have been due, in part, to their effective communication strategy (3, 4). Of all the rules that were enforced to various degrees around the world, those that kept people apart from one another, like cancelling public gatherings and restrictingmovement, were among the most contested, yet effective, interventions to reduce earlyspread of COVID-19 (5). Longitudinal cross-national studies found that policies likeschool closures and stay-at-home orders increased social distancing and were effective in slowing COVID-19 daily con rmed cases (6) and deaths (7). Therefore, motivating engagement in social distancing has been emphasized as a critical global public health pri-ority by researchers (8, 9) and global policy makers (1) alike. Motivation science from the framework of self-determination theory (SDT) can pro- vide insight into why some ways of communicating can motivate behavior change,Signicance Communicating in ways that motivate engagement in socialdistancing remains a critical globalpublic health priority during theCOVID-19 pandemic. This studytested motivational qualities of messages about social distancing (those that promoted choice andagency vs. those that wereforceful and shaming) in 25,718people in 89 countries. Theautonomy-supportive messagedecreased feelings of defyingsocial distancing recommendations relative to the controlling message, and thecontrolling message increasedcontrolled motivation, a lesseffective form of motivation,relative to no message. Messagetype did not impact intentions tosocially distance, but people 's existing motivations were related to intentions.

SDT (10) has long investigated the effects of communication style on the quality, quantity, and sustainability of people 's motivation to change their behavior. New Zealand 's communication strategy as described in the opening quote is one example of an autonomy-supportive communication style that helps people understand and endorse the value of the requested behavior. This communi- cation style involves perspective taking (e.g., acknowledging howdifcult it is to alter one 's daily life), providing a meaningful rationale (e.g., explaining why social distancing is effective andimportant for reducing viral spread), and supporting individual agency and ownership in terms of how to respond within the practical constraints of the situation (e.g., offering safe alternativesfrom which to choose) (11). In contrast, a controlling communi-cation style, as illustrated with those used by the state of Oregon and the United Kingdom in the opening quote, is characterized by demanding language (e.g., informing people what they should,must or have to do) and relies on shaming and blaming to moti-vate behavior change (12). Although some argue that controlling messages are necessary in enforcing adherence in the short term (13), this adherence declines over time (14). Moreover, control-l i n gm e s s a g e sc a nh a v et h eo p p o s i t ee f f e c to fi n c r e a s i n gu n d e s i r e dbehaviors and feelings of de ance or wanting to do the opposite of what is being requested (15, 16). Autonomy-supportive mes- sages, on the other hand, consistently increase adherence in the short and long term (14, 17) and reduce feelings of de ance (15, 16). Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, employers, local governments, national governments, and global healthagencies, like the World Health Organization (WHO), haveurged people to take various mitigation actions, like social dis- tancing. People have repeatedly de ed social distancing recom- mendations (18, 19); this is not surprising because de ance occurs when people are bombarded with messages to changetheir behavior and perceive their freedom as restricted (20, 21).This trend of de ance threatens to accelerate viral spread. Thus, establishing whether different messaging approaches can curb feelings of de ance and increase adherence to social dis- tancing recommendations is crucial. Autonomy-supportive messages about social distancing may be more effective than controlling messages because they promoteautonomous motivation or internalizing the value and impor- tance of the requested behavior (e.g., engaging in social distancing to protect their own and others 'health). On the other hand, con- trolling messages about social distancing may be less effectivethan autonomy-supportive messages because they promote con-trolled motivation, a poorly internalized form of motivation rely- ing on avoiding punishment, social judgments, and feelings of shame and guilt (e.g., engaging in social distancing to avoid dis-approval from others) (10). Across myriad behaviors, autonomousmotivation predicts greater behavior change than controlled moti- vation in the short and long term (22). This experiment investigated whether and how communica- tion strategies delivered online in short written messages, a l o w - c o s ta n dc o m m o nm e t h o do fc o n v e y i n gp u b l i ch e a l t hrecommendations (23), could motivate social distancing. Partici-pants recruited from 89 countries were exposed to an autonomy-supportive message, a controlling message, or no message. We recognized that prior to and during the ve months of data col- lection (from April to September 2020), participants wereencountering a high volume of messages about social distancingin their everyday lives that varied widely in how autonomy sup- portive vs. controlling they were. We thus used the \"no-message \" comparison condition to capture participants 'motivation as a function of exposure to messages received prior to ourexperiment. Regardless of prior message exposure, we were inter- ested in the magnitude of effects (even if minimal) resulting from exposure to a new motivational message to inform public healthstakeholders about realistic effects they could expect to see if implemented at scale. Three research aims were supported by this design. First, we aimed to determine the extent to which brief written autonomy-supportive and controlling messages differentially affect motivation, feelings of de ance, and behavioral intentions to follow social distancing recommendations. We did not tracksocial distancing adherence over time due to varied resources across the many data collection laboratories and opted to mea- sure behavioral intentions (both short and long term) for social distancing instead. Behavioral intentions or plans to perform a behavior (24) are a key determinant of behavioral adherenceand a common outcome for health behavior interventions (24, 25). A second aim was to determine whether the differential effects of autonomy-supportive and controlling messages gener- alize across a geographically diverse sample (26). Finally, we aimed to test associations between motivations to follow socialdistancing recommendations and feelings of de ance and behav- ioral intentions. Recent longitudinal research in Belgium and the United Kingdom suggests that people can simultaneously holdautonomous and controlled motivations for following COVID- 19-related recommendations (e.g., handwashing, social distancing, mask wearing) but that only autonomous motivation predicted greater adherence over time; controlled motivation either did not relate or predicted lower adherence over time (27, 28). This global sample allows us to test the generalizability of these differential associations between autonomous and controlled motivation and indicators of adherence to social distancing recommendations, independent of the messaging effects we observe. Finding predic- tors of de ance and intentions to socially distance that generalize across a global sample, whether from experimental messages or from participants 'existing motivations for social distancing, is crit- ical for informing the best routes of intervention. Our hypotheses and data analysis plan were preregistered prior to data collection at https://osf.io/2u6xs/ . Hypothesis 1: Compared with the controlling message, those in the autonomy-supportive message and no-message conditions will report 1) higher internalized motivation to socially distance, 2) lower feelings of de ance, and 3) higher short-term (one- week) and long-term (six-month) intentions to socially distance. In other words, we expected the autonomy-supportive message to have bene ts over the controlling message and the controlling message to have worse outcomes compared with no message at all. Hypothesis 2: Autonomous motivation for social distancing will be associated with 1) lower feelings of de ance and greater short-term (one-week) and long-term (six-month) intentions to socially distance, while controlled motivation will 2) have inverse associations with de ance and behavioral intentions. Results Descriptive Statistics. Descriptive statistics for all variables ana- lyzed in this study, including correlations among variables, arepresented in Table 1. Fig. 1 shows the nal samples used in analyses after data exclusions ( SI Appendix has a description). Fig. 2 shows distributions of study variables, indicating that, on average, participants were already following social distancing to a high degree, they intended to continue following recommen-dations in the future, they already highly endorsed the value of the recommendations, and they reported feeling very little de - ance about these recommendations. 2o f1 1 https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2111091119 pnas.org Downloaded from https://www.pnas.org by 213.10.56.1 on July 6, 2022 from IP address 213.10.56.1. Confirmatory Analyses. Given the large sample size in this study, con rmatory analyses were preregistered with a speci ed region of practical equivalence to aid interpretation of statisti- cally signi cant but small effects. We speci ed that a hypothesis would be supported if an effect and its 95% CI were fully out-side of the null interval of d=/C00.050 to 0.050 (equivalent to partial r[r p]=/C00.025 to 0.025). If an effect and its 95% CI overlap with the null interval, it would not be considered prac- tically meaningful, and the hypothesis would not be supported. This cutoff was informed by d=j0.05jas our smallest effect size of interest.* Results reported in the text focus on partial r(rp) for random intercept models (Table 2 shows a more complete reporting ofthe statistics, and Table 3 presents these models adding in ran-dom slopes for predictor variables). SI Appendix has additional analyses. Hypothesis 1. Fig. 3 shows a visualization of con rmatory effects for Hypothesis 1. Autonomous and controlled motivation. Across all message con- ditions, autonomous motivation was high (mean and SD inTable 1). We did not nd evidence that the autonomy- supportive message condition meaningfully yielded higherautonomous motivation than the controlling message condition (r p=0.034, 95% CI [0.021, 0.046]), nor did we nd evidence that those in the no-message condition reported higher autono-mous motivation than those in the controlling message condi-tion ( r p=-0.012, 95% CI [ -0.024, 0.001]). Across all message conditions, controlled motivation was moderate. Those in the no-message condition showed lowercontrolled motivation than those in the controlling messagecondition ( r p=-0.096, 95% CI [ -0.108, -0.084]). However, we did not nd evidence of a difference in controlledmotivation between the autonomy-supportive message and con- trolling message conditions ( rp=-0.026, 95% CI [ -0.039, -0.014]). Feelings of defiance. Across conditions, feelings of de ance were low. The autonomy-supportive message led to lower feelings ofdeance than the controlling message ( r p=-0.064, 95% CI [-0.076, -0.052]). However, we did not nd a difference between the no-message and the controlling message conditions (rp=-0.003, 95% CI [ -0.015, 0.000]). Short- and long-term behavioral intentions. People generally intended to socially distance in the next week and intended tocontinue socially distancing for the majority of the next sixmonths. The autonomy-supportive message condition did notyield differences in one-week social distancing intentions from the controlling message condition ( r p=0.009, 95% CI 0.029]). Similarly, the mes-sage condition did not yield differences in social distancingintentions in the next six months from the controlling messagecondition ( r p=-0.010, 95% CI rp=-0.001, [ -0.014, 0.000]). Thus, we did not nd that conditions differed in short- or long-term behavioral intentions to socially distance. Hypothesis 2. Feelings of defiance. As expected, autonomous motivation predicted lower feelings of de ance ( rp=-0.522, 95% CI [ -0.530, -0.514]). Additionally, of de ( rp=0.223, 95% CI intentions. Autonomous motiva- tion was associated with greater intentions to socially distance in the next week ( rp=0.433, 95% CI [0.423, 0.442]), whereas controlled motivation was positively associated with behavioralintentions to socially distance in the next six months ( r p= 0.465, 95% CI [0.456, 0.474]), whereas with longer-term inten-tions ( r p=-0.102, 95% 1.

Exploratory Analyses. We conducted exploratory analyses using the same analytical approach to test our hypotheses on a subsam- ple of participants who took the study within the rst month of their country enacting lockdowns and other policies enabling social distancing ( n=1,981) (Table 4).The rationale for this analysis was to examine whether the effects of our manipulationmight be larger early on in the pandemic. In this analysis, we also included a covariate \u2014country 'st o t a lc a s e sp e rm i l l i o n \u2014to test for the possibility that the country-speci c incidence rate may predict motivation, feelings of de ance, and behavioral intentions. Results showed evidence for two additional experimental effects: the autonomy-supportive message increased autonomous motivationto engage in social distancing relative to the controlling message(r p=0.117, 95% CI [0.073, 0.160]), and the controlling message increased feelings of de ance relative to no message, rp=-0.130, 95% CI [-0.173, -0.087]. We also observed a larger effect of theautonomy-suppportive message eliciting lower feelings of de ance than the controlling message in this subsample, r p=-0.217, 95% CI [-0.258, -0.175]. The effect of the controlling messageincreasing controlled motivation to engage in social distancing rel- ative to no message remained ( rp=-0.107, 95% CI [ -0.151, -0.064]). We also observed a larger effect of the autonomy- supportive message eliciting lower feelings of de ance than the controlling message in this subsample ( rp=-0.217, 95% CI [-0.258, -0.175]). Just as full sample, we did not nd evi- dence of a difference between the controlling and no-message con-ditions on de ance, nor did we nd condition differences on short- or long-term behavioral intentions. With respect to our exploratory covariate, we found that country-speci ci n c i d e n c e rate correlated with greater intentions for social distancing in thenext six months ( r p=0.445, 95% CI [0.410, 0.479]). Discussion Public health communications play a critical role in managing health emergencies, including during pandemics, by motivatingpeople to engage in behaviors like handwashing, mask wearing,vaccine uptake, and social distancing (26). Here, we tested moti-vational qualities (autonomy supportive vs. controlling) of mes- sages about social distancing in individuals recruited across 89 countries. The aim was to identify empirically supported commu-nication strategies that can be generalized cross-culturally toTable 2.

We conducted exploratory analyses prior to peer review that focused on countries with available data in April 2020. These analyses found the same pattern of results and aredescribed in prior preprint versions: 213.10.56.1 on July 6, 2022 from IP address 213.10.56.1. inform public health practices not only in this but also, in future global health emergencies. We found evidence for two con rmatory experimental effects. 1) The controlling, pressuring message increased con- trolled motivation to follow recommendations out of guilt andfear of social punishment more than the messages to whichparticipants had been previously exposed. 2) The autonomy-supportive message that promoted agency and ownership low-ered feelings of de ance relative to the controlling message. Furthermore, exploratory analyses focusing on message deliveryearly on in the pandemic (i.e., within the rst month after countries instituted lockdowns and other policies urging social distancing) found two more effects; compared with the control- ling message, the autonomy-supportive message increasedautonomous motivation or internalizing the value of socialdistancing, and the controlling message increased feelings ofdeance relative to no message at all. The con rmatory experi- mental effects are small according to Cohen 's benchmarks (29), but they were in line with effect sizes observed in a meta-analysis of health messaging campaigns (average r=0.09, 95% CI [0.07, 0.10], rvalues ranging from 0.04 to 0.15). Notably, this meta-analysis (30) found that effects tend to be smaller for media campaigns motivating avoidance behaviors (e.g., the average effect size for smoking cessation media campaigns was r =0.03, 95% CI [0.02, 0.04]), which could explain the small effect sizes we found when motivating people to avoid gather-ing with others. However, we did not nd evidence for effects of either autonomy-supportive or controlling messages on short- or long-term intentions to follow social distancing recommenda- tions. We consider several possibilities that may contribute tothe lack of messaging effects on behavioral intentions. First, itcould be due to a ceiling effect of adherence to social distancingrecommendations, making it dif cult to increase adherencethat is already very high. Second, by the time data collection started in mid-April 2020, participants had already beenexposed to hundreds, if not thousands, of messages promotingsocial distancing with varying motivational content. As a result,the potential impact of a single message on people 's short-term and long-term intentions to engage in social distancing may be negligible relative to a context where participants were exposedto a new health message for the rst and potentially, only time. As well, the \"dosage \"of our intervention \u2014one brief (two- minute) written message \u2014is likely less effective than receiving autonomy support during an intervention that might last weeksor months (17). Asking people to alter their daily lives toabstain from social interactions might require more time andeffort than the brief online message we provided. Finally, there may be complex factors preventing social distancing (e.g., maintaining one 's livelihood, traveling to care for sick relatives) that may require tangible, economic interventions before mes-sages can have an impact (31). Compared with the experimental effects of motivational messages, people 's existing motivations for social distancing were better predictors of behavioral intentions, fully supportingHypothesis 2. In particular, those who reported higher motiva- tion driven by the value and importance of social distancing expressed greater behavioral intentions to engage in social dis-tancing in both the short term and long term. Conversely, fol-lowing social distancing rules out of guilt and fear of socialpunishment correlated with lower long-term behavioral inten-tions. Further, exploratory analyses focused on the rst wave of the pandemic found that higher daily cases were associatedwith greater long-term intentions to socially distance. Taken together, results suggest that intentions to adhere to social distancing recommendations were explained more bypeople 's existing motivations and perceptions of viral risk than the messages used in this study. From these data, we can Fig. 1. Flowchart delineating the nal samples used in analyses.

Even so, public sentiment plays a key role in supporting publichealth measures and in the effectiveness of managing healthemergencies (32, 33). Design Limitations and Future Directions. First, due to conve- nience sampling methods, distributions of study variables suggest that our sample was highly autonomously motivated, alreadyengaged in social distancing, and had very low feelings of de - ance. Therefore, our results may not be generalizable to thosewho might have resisted social distancing or those who lived inareas where social distancing rules were not imposed. Addition- ally, we did not investigate whether message type (autonomy supportive or controlling) might be more or less effective ininfluencing outcomes as a function of its source/communicator (e.g., expertise, trustworthiness) (34, 35), cultural context (e.g.,individualistic -collectivistic, democratic -authoritarian, cultural tightness -looseness, interpersonal distance preferences) (36 -38), local or national infection rates, or legal restrictions (6). Forexample, a recent study by Gelfand et al. (37) suggests thatcountries that score higher on cultural tightness show lowerdeath rates compared with countries with looser cultures, whichtend to be less strict about norm deviance. As such, it seems plausible that cultural tightness vs. looseness may impact how motivational messages are interpreted, and this should be investi-gated in future work. Although the current study aimed toidentify generalizable bene ts and harms of different motiva- tional communication styles, we encourage researchers to usethis dataset and the larger Psychological Science Accelerator COVID-19 Rapid Project (PSACR) dataset ( https://osf.io/ gvw56/ ) to examine these and other questions. Conclusions. We conclude that in a public health context, autonomy-supportive messages have some bene ts over control- ling messages for motivation and feelings of de ance (although we did not nd evidence that messages mattered for people 's behavioral intentions). Messaging effects on motivation andfeelings of de ance observed in this study were small, but they likely have meaningful real-world impacts when accumulatedacross time and global populations (39, 40), whereas theireffects on intentions to comply with social distancing recom- mendations likely do not. The strength of the manipulation used in this study is the ease and ef ciency of producing and digitally disseminating these brief messages that can reach alarge number of people in a short amount of time. Findingsmay have similar applications for other public health behavioral recommendations, including mask wearing, handwashing, self- quarantining after exposure, and vaccination, for which evi-dence of de ance has also been observed (41). Readers seeking further guidance for applying SDT to motivate COVID-19-related behavioral recommendations may also review Mar- tela et al. (42) and Bradshaw et al. (43). Finally, while SDT principles for strategic communication likely apply to motivat- ing other behaviors of interest to public health stakeholders,communications aimed at modifying behavior should be Fig. 2.

This study represents a major undertaking and truly interna- tional collaboration involving the coordination of laboratoriesin 89 different countries and collecting a total sample of 25,718 participants. The strongest ndings from this research support the generalizability of meaningful and differential rela-tions between people 's existing motivations on public health compliance intentions, suggesting bene ts of cultivating auton- omous motivation and limiting controlled motivation. Theeffects of messages were more modest; the controlling messageincreased feelings of de ance relative to the autonomy- supportive message and increased controlled motivation \u2014a less optimal form of motivation associated with lower intentions tosocially distance \u2014relative to no message. This research, includ- ing the cross-national sample and transparent reporting of materials and data ( https://osf.io/fc9y7/ ), can help advance future research and applications of evidence-based health com-munication on a global scale for the current COVID-19 pan-demic and for future public health crises.Materials and Methods This study was one of three studies in the PSACR ( https://psyarxiv.com/x976j/ has details about logistics and additional measures administered). Through thePsychological Science Accelerator (PSA) (45), the methodological approach,measures, and analytic strategy received extensive feedback from coauthors andexternal reviewers before data collection began.

Data from 26 laboratories across 17 countries (with 2 nonoverlappingcountries) were collected from SDT network laboratories (invited through the SDTlistserv). \u00b6Participating laboratories recruited participants via local university sub- ject pools or relied on social media posts and emails to invite those in theirpersonal networks to participate. Additionally, our sample also included 5,304additional participants recruited through semirepresentative panels (quotaTable 3.

Participants 'compensation differed depending on how they were recruited and which laboratory recruited them. As such, some participants received pay-ments, others received course credit at their university, and some did not receivecompensation (more details on recruitment and compensation are at https:// psyarxiv.com/x976j/ ). After data exclusions (Fig. 1), our nal sample was 25,718 participants across 89 countries, representing all inhabited continents. SI Appendix ,T a b l eS 1 shows a list of sample sizes corresponding to each country. Of the total sample, 63.3%identi ed as female ( n=16,273), 33.6% identi ed as male ( n=8,636), 1.1% indicated that male and female categories did not t for them ( n=288), and 2% preferred not to respond. The age of the sample ranged between 18 and89 years, with a mean age of 37 years (SD =15.6). Experimental Manipulation. Participants were randomly assigned to an autonomy-supportive message condition, a controlling message condition, or ano-message condition. The autonomy-supportive and controlling message condi-tions presented comparable information about social distancing, including itsdenition, its implications for public health during the COVID-19 outbreak, and neutral informative behavioral recommendations. Alongside this basic content,both messages contained theory-based motivational elements shown in priormanipulations to in fluence motivation (15, 46). Speci cally, those in the autonomy-supportive message condition read an article that provided 1) per-spective taking (e.g., acknowledging how dif cult it is to alter one 's daily life), 2) a meaningful rationale (e.g., explaining why social distancing is effective andimportant for slowing transmission), and 3) a sense of having choice over one 's own behavior within the practical constraints of the situation. In comparison,those in the controlling message condition read an article that pairedinformation with coercion, shame, and pressure, including the use of demand- ing language, such as \"should \"and \"must. \"Finally, those in the no-message condition did not read any message; instead, they directly responded to the out- come measures. Measures. For all multiitem measures, items were reverse scored where appro- priate and then, combined into composites for our variables. Per the preregistra- tion, if a composite variable did not have acceptable reliability ( total>0.70), we retained items with corrected item -total correlations exceeding 0.30 (Table 1). The wording of outcome items differed slightly depending on condition. In the autonomy-supportive and controlling message conditions, items referred to \"social distancing recommendations in this article, \"while in the no-message condition, items referred to \"social distancing recommendations \"(not tied to an article). Autonomous and controlled motivation. Following random assignment to see an autonomy-supportive message, a controlling message, or no message, partici- pants completed a measure of their motivation to follow social distancing recom- mendations. This measure was adapted from a previous measure of perceived locus of causality (47, 48) for the behavior of social distancing. Participants responded to the prompt \"I plan to follow social distancing recommendations [in this article] because \"with four autonomous and four controlled reasons for doing so. Example items assessing autonomous motivation included \"the recom- mendations re flect my values \"and \"it is personally important to me to follow them. \"Example items assessing controlled motivation included \"because others would disapprove of me if I did not \"and \"I would feel guilty if I did not follow the recommendation. \"The items were paired with a seven-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 =strongly agree). Autonomous and controlled motivation items were aggregated into two separate variables for analyses as both scales showed good reliability (autonomous motivation: =0.90; controlled motiva- tion:=0.77). Feelings of defiance. Feelings of de ance were measured with four items adapted from Vansteenkiste et al. (49). Items measured feelings of de anceTable 4.

The items were \"make me feel like I want to do exactly the opposite, \"\"feel aggravating, \"\"feel like an intrusion, \"and \"make me want to resist attempts to in fluence me. \"These items showed good reliability ( =0.89). Short- and long-term behavioral intentions. Intentions were measured at a more abstract level of actions (e.g., \"following recommendations to participate in social distancing \") as well as at a lower and more concrete level of actions (e.g., \"avoid gatherings with friends \") as both contribute to goal pursuit [reviewed by Freund and Hennecke (50)]. Our behavioral intention items were adapted fromArmitage and Conner (51) and Flannelly et al. (52), following an adaptation byMcGarrity and Huebner (53), to assess participants 'intentions for social distanc- ing. Items assessing short-term intentions asked participants how likely theywould be to \"follow the recommendation to participate in social distancing \"and avoid \"gatherings with friends, \"\"going to crowded areas, \"and \"taking nones- sential shopping trips \"in the next week. The response scale ranged from 1 =extremely unlikely to 7 =extremely likely. The scale showed good reliability for all four items combined ( =0.88). The measure for long-term intentions asked, \"assuming the guidelines [described in the article] last for six months, how long do you intend on avoiding the following in-person places andactivities, \"and the list of activities included \"restaurants, \"\"gatherings with friends, \"\"traveling, \"\"going in crowded areas, \"\"nonessential shopping trips, \" \"getting a haircut or going to the salon, \"and \"going to the gym or tness class- es.\"These items were rated in one-week increments using a drop-down menu f r o m0t o2 4w e e k s .A na v e r a g es c o r ew a sc a l c u l a t e df o ra l ls e v e ni t e m sa st h e yshowed good reliability ( =0.92). Demographic information. Demographics assessed by both PSA and SDT labo- ratories were age, gender, education, and country. The PSACR general survey (https://osf.io/ecba8/ ) also collected additional demographic and background var- iables related to COVID-19 beyond the scope of this study. Design and Procedure. All data collection laboratories followed the ethical guidelines of their institutions. Guidelines for internet-based data collection Fig. 3. Illustrating con rmatory effects testing Hypothesis 1. Effect sizes are drawn from intercept-only models in Table 2 ( n=25,718). Values to the left of zero indicate that no message (or the autonomy-supportive message) yielded lower scores on outcomes than the controlling message. Values to the righ to f zero indicate that no message (or the autonomy-supportive message) yielded higher scores on those outcomes than the controlling message. The square represents the observed effect size, and the whiskers represents the 95% CIs; if the effect and its 95% CI fall outside the dotted lines (the interval nu ll of rp=/C00.025 to 0.025), the effect is considered practically meaningful.

Each laboratory 1) received ethical approval from their local institutional review board (IRB), 2) gained approval through Ash-land University 's Human Subject 's Review Board (for the PSA laboratories) or through the Illinois Institute of Technology 's IRB (for the SDT laboratories), or 3) did not require local IRB approval for data collection. All participants providedinformed consent before entering the study. Participants completed the study online between mid-April 2020 and the end of September 2020. Data were collected using formr (55) for PSACR laboratories and Qualtrics for SDT laboratories. Some participants completedour study along with another PSACR experiment in random order; orderwas recorded to examine potential carryover effects. More informationabout study design, translations, and measures of baseline social distancingadherence and perceived control used for the manipulation check is in SI Appendix . Analytic Plan. Modeling approach. All analyses were conducted in R (version 1.3.1056). To account for the nested structure of the data, we used mixed effects modelsin the statistical package lme4 (version 1.1-21) (56). In testing Hypothesis 1,the controlling message condition served as the reference group and was comparedwith the autonomy-supportive and no-message conditions. For Hypothesis 2, con-trolled and autonomous motivation were entered as simultaneous predictors. We focus on random intercept models in the text. We estimated models with and without random slopes, with nearly identical results (Tables 2 and 3). Theequation of the random intercept models is as follows: Y iC\u00bc0\u00fe1/C1NoMessage iC\u00fe2/C1AutonomySupportive iC\u00feu0C\u00feeiC: In this equation, each observation is clustered within grouping variable c (country). 0is the overall intercept for the reference group (the controlling message condition), and u0Cis the random effect of the intercept. The xed effects include 1and2, which are the slopes representing the difference between the no-message condition and the autonomy-supportive message condition, respec- tively, and the controlling message condition. We used the TOSTER package (version 0.3.4) (57) to illustrate xed effects and their 95% CIs (Fig. 3) and calculated partial r(rp) values (standardized effect sizes) using the r2beta function in r2glmm (version 0.1.2) (58). Exploratory analyses. Data collection launched in April 2020 and continued through September 2020. We speculated that communication strategies urging social distancing might have been more impactful early on in our data collection period before message fatigue or exhaustion from prolonged exposure to socialdistancing messages, set in (21). Thus, we explored message effects among thosewho completed the study within 30 days of their country rst enacting policies aimed at promoting social distancing. To identify those participants, we used thepublicly available dataset Our World in Data (59). From this dataset, we extractedtwo types of information. First, we extracted stringency index data from the OxfordCOVID-19 Government Response Tracker (60) to identify when there was thesteepest increase in lockdowns and other policies aimed at social distancing (e.g.,school closures) within two consecutive weeks. This happened in March and earlyApril for all countries available in our sample. We restricted the sample in explor-atory analyses to those who completed the study within the rst 30 days after their country 's rise in these policies. Second, we extracted data that came from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineeringat Johns Hopkins University (61) on the incidence rate in a country (cases per mil-lion to account for population differences) at the time participants completed thestudy. We de ned country-speci c incidence rate as a covariate in exploratory analyses, allowing us to test the possibility that motivation, feelings of de ance, and behavioral intentions to socially distance would be predicted by case num-bers in that country. Together, this analytic approach provided a more sensitivetest of a country 's unique pandemic experience during its rst wave. Because some countries had small amounts of data during this early time period, we onlyincluded random intercepts but not random slopes for these analyses. Data Availability. The preregistration, materials, analytic plan, code, and data to reproduce all analyses have been deposited in the Open Science Framework (62). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS.
