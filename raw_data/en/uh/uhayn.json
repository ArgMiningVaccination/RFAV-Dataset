Pursuant to state law, OSU provides exemptions from this immunization requirement. Both medical and non-medical exemptions are available. Risks of non-immunization include infection with Meningococcal disease. Meningococcus is a bacterium that can infect the blood or the lining of the brain causing severe disease that may result in loss of limbs, loss of organ function, or death. Symptoms Individuals with MenB disease typically develop a high fever, severe headache, stiff neck, and body aches. They may experience vomiting, a rash and extreme fatigue. These symptoms usually progress very quickly over 24 hours. Anyone with these symptoms should go to a healthcare provider immediately. Please be aware that, based on guidance from public health authorities, students with MenB immunization waivers may be excluded from campus for some disease outbreaks.
