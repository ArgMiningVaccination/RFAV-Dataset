Many of these degenerative diseases show some familial associa - tion, thus a genetic basis has been assumed. Yet, the nature and frequency of genetic variants in the human population has not changed significantly in the past 50 years, even though the incidence of these diseases has climbed contin - uously (Wallace, 2005). Therefore, because the increased and increasing incidence of cancer cannot be attributed to population-wide genetic change during this short timeframe, the cause must be external to the genome, in the \"environ - ment\", which with relation to diet and chemical exposures, has altered radically in the past few decades. Cancer has been widely considered a genetic disease involving nuclear mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes; this view persists despite the numerous inconsistencies asso-ciated with the somatic mutation theory. In contrast to the somatic mutation theory, emerging evidence suggests that cancer is a mitochondrial metabolic disease, according to the original theory of Otto Warburg (Warburg, 1956). Res - piratory insufficiency is the origin of cancer according to Warburg's theory. We are proposing cancer as a mitochon -Michael J Gonzalez \u00b9; Thomas Seyfried\u00b2 ; Garth L. ; Barry J Jaime Alex Hunninghake10; Miguel J Berdiel11; Amanda Cintr\u00f3n12 1.

A shift from oxidative phosphorylation to fermentation can cause cellular de-differentiation, an important characteristic of malignancy. As described already in the 1920s by Otto Warburg, can - cer cells often show a shift in energy production from mito - This aerobic glyco-lysis, in which glucose is converted to pyruvate and lactate in spite of the presence of oxygen, is a major characteristic of most tumor cells. Importantly, this increase in glycolytic activity was similar to that observed in early embryonic cells. Thus cancer cells seem to resume a more primitive meta-bolic pattern (Gonzalez et al., 2012). This brings us to Albert Szent Gyorgi's elucidation of malignancy as a reversion to the primordial state (Alpha State) from the oxidative or Beta State of normal cell functions. We can support these con - cepts by providing information about the nature, etiology and function of mitochondria in normal and cancer cells. Aerobic glycolysis not only provides the cell with ATP from 2 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4the readily available substrate glucose, but the rapid glyco - lytic flux can also provide the cells with the necessary sub - strates and metabolic intermediates for lipid, amino acid and DNA synthesis that are needed for growth. For example, NADPH, ribose, acetyl-CoA and glucose-derived non-es - sential amino acids can be provided by aerobic glycolysis. In addition to an altered use of glucose, cancer cells make energetically inefficient use of glutamine to supply the nitro - gen for the synthesis of nucleotides and non-essential amino acids, and to facilitate import of essential amino acids and support NADPH production. Glycolytic metabolism and the associated metabolic re-programming not only support rapid growth, although at the expense of other cells, but they also make the cancer cell less dependent on oxygen availability while generating an acidic micro-environment that enhances malignancy. It has been long appreciated that under hypox - ic conditions glycolytic rates are enhanced, with a resulting increase in lactate production. Cancer cells produce far less ATP per molecule of glu - cose (i.e., reduced efficiency); nevertheless, they can pro-duce ATP at a much faster rate due to rapid consumption of substrates. Cancer cells produce ATP almost a hundred times faster than normal cells (Demetrius, Coy & Tuszyn - ski, 2010). Cancer cells actively produce more glucose transporters on their cell surface membranes, so that more glucose is brought inside the cell. This increase in glucose metabolism through glycolysis allows the generation of gly - colytic intermediates that funnel into biosynthetic pathways that support the production of NADPH, lipids, proteins and nucleotides. Respiration cannot operate smoothly unless all of the del - icate interior structures inside mitochondria are intact and functional. Mitochondria have evolved with a process called retrograde response (RTG), which helps them deal with temporary stress or damage. The retrograde response was designed for temporary emergency use, not long-term use, and yet cancer cells appear to stay in this mode. Where-as the RTG response evolved to protect cells from sudden energy failure, a persistent RTG response with inadequate respiration can cause genomic instability, and eventually this can result in tumorigenesis (Butow & Avadhani, 2004). Genome instability is linked to mitochondrial dysfunctions through retrograde signaling. Thus, this emerging evidence supports an important role for metabolic aberrancies and mitochondrial dysfunction in cancer. In general, suggesting that cancer is primarily a mitochondrial metabolic disease (Gonzalez et al., 2012; Seyfried & Shelton, 2010). Mitochondria and CancerThe mitochondria are ancient bacterial symbionts with their own mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), RNA, and protein synthe-sizing systems. Each human cell contains hundreds of mito -chondria. Margulis theorized that mitochondria are probably descended from free-living bacteria that survived endocyto - sis by a eukaryotic host cell. Such symbiosis is a potent and largely unappreciated and unrecognized force in evolution. Mitochondria play a greater physiological role than have been previously appreciated. Some important mitochondrial functions are: (a) energy conversion with production of aden - osine triphosphate (ATP), (b) regulation of membrane po - tential, (c) signaling and messaging through reactive oxygen species, (d) calcium signaling, (e) apoptosis and autophagy, (f) cellular metabolism, (g) iron metabolism and heme synthe - sis, and (h) steroid synthesis (Seyfried & Shelton, 2010). Mitochondria synthesize the universal energy molecule ATP. They accomplish this through glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and electron transport in con-junction with the oxidation of metabolites by the Kreb's cycle and the breakdown of fatty acids by Beta oxidation. Because of their capacity to generate ATP, mitochondria are known exclusively for their ability to produce ATP, the main fuel for the basic energy demands of the cell. We inherit our mito - chondrial DNA from our mothers. Although mitochondria are present in sperm, they are not transferred to the ova during the process of fertilization since most of them are in the tail which is lost in the process. Mitochondria are so efficient at producing energy that their arrival on the evolutionary scene is thought to be responsi-ble for the increase in complexity of living things. Building and supporting elaborate new creatures with specialized organs and capabilities requires a superabundance of ener - gy (for organization, compartmentalization, order, and com - munication). If large quantities of energy are not constantly produced to maintain form, function, order and organization; then complex organisms will gradually succumb to entropy or chaos. For cells, this will mean that they regress, and as their DNA becomes unstable; they can lose their cellular shape, they become more disorganized, inter-cell communi - cation is impaired, and they start reproducing uncontrollably as a survival mechanism (Gonzalez et al., 2010). Mitochondria are active, mobile intracellular organelles that undergo constant fission and fusion. They form an in - terconnected network with other cellular organelles; and their functions extend beyond the cell membranes to include influ- ence on the organism's entire physiology by affecting com- munication between cells, tissues and organs. Unsurprisingly therefore, any small defect in any of these functions could elicit mitochondrial dysfunction and promote a combination of diseases including cancer, metabolic disorders, and neurode - generative diseases (Elliott, Jiang & Head, 2015). Mitochondria are continually confronted with factors that can jeopardize how well they function. These factors in -3 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4clude: chronic stress, sleep disturbances, hyperglycemia, xenobiotics such as drugs, antibiotics, organic pollutants and environmental toxins. These factors can cause mito-chondrial dysfunction, which can be characterized by any of four ways; (a) insufficient number of mitochondria, (b) insuf needed for oxidative phosphorylation, (e.g., nutrient deficiency due to poor diet or drug-induced nutrient depletion), (c) acquired dysfunction in the ATP synthesis machinery, or (d) damage to the mito-chondrial membranes. Mitochondrial dysfunction results in a number of cellular consequences, including: (i) decreased ATP production; (ii) increased reliance on alternative anaer-obic energy sources; and (iii) increased production of reac - tive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS). Of interest is that ROS/RNS can also have a variety of normal roles, which include regulation of gene expression (Turpaev, 2002; Dalton, Shertzer & Puga \"redox mes-sengers\" in intracellular signaling and regulation. ROS/RNS molecular recognition occurs at both the atomic and at the macromolecular level which expands the potential number of ROS/RNS-specific receptors and interaction sites. Nev - ertheless an unbalanced production of ROS/RNS can be detrimental to mitochondrial function and viability. At the molecular level, a reduction in mitochondrial function occurs as a result of the following changes: (a) a loss of main - tenance of the electrical and chemical transmembrane poten - tial of the inner mitochondrial membrane, (b) alterations in the function of the electron transport chain, including those due to insufficiencies of nutrients and cofactors/coenzymes essen - tial for mitochondrial function such as magnesium, thiamine, ubiquinone, lipoic acid or (c) a reduction in the transport of critical metabolites into mitochondria. In turn, these changes result in a reduced efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and a reduction in the production of ATP (Nicolson, 2014a). Many of the organic cofactors/coenzymes and structural fatty ac - ids and phospholipids essential for mitochondrial function are damaged or destroyed. Several components of this system require routine replacement, and this need may be facilitated with specific dietary/substrate supplements. Proof of the importance of metabolic and mitochondrial dysfunction in the cellular etiology of cancer is evidenced by the observations that damaged mitochondria can turn healthy cells into transformed cells, and that healthy mito - chondria can reverse cancerous behavior in tumor cells. These observations provide an insight that cancer is not simply or exclusively a genetic disease, but more so a mito - chondrial disease (Gonzalez et al., 2012; Seyfried & Shel- ton, 2010). Mitochondrial dysfunction plays a central role in a wide range of diseases in addition to cancer. These diseas - es include: neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheim - er's disease, disease, amyotrophic and Friedreich's ataxia; cardi-ovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis and other heart and vascular conditions; diabetes and metabolic syndrome; autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and type 1 diabetes; neurobehavioral and psychiatric diseases, such as autism spectrum disor - ders, schizophrenia, and bipolar and mood disorders; gas - trointestinal disorders; fatiguing illnesses, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and Gulf War illnesses; musculoskeletal diseases, such as fibromyalgia and skeletal muscle atrophy; and chronic infections (Pagano et al., 2014). Many pharmaceuticals have been identified as mitocho - drial toxicants (Meyer et al.,2013; Goodson et al., 2015; Narayanan et al., 2015). The high lipid content of mitochon - drial membranes facilitates accumulation of lipophilic com - pounds and also of organic chemicals, particularly amphi - philic xenobiotics such others. Cationic metal ions, such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and manganese, have also been shown to accu - mulate in mitochondria. Another factor contributing to mito - chondrial susceptibility is the presence of cytochrome P450s in mitochondria, which can activate chemicals that are rel- atively non-reactive prior to metabolism. At the same time, mitochondria can also be protected in several ways, includ-ing greater redundancy of their contents, ability to replace defective components; via mitophagy, biogenesis, comple-mentation and apoptosis. An important property in mitochondria is their controlled leak of matrix protons. Leaky mitochondria cause uncoordi-nated electron transport that causes energy to be wasted as heat instead of being converted into ATP. This mitochondrial uncoupling has been shown in faster-growing tumors that are actually warmer because of this effect. Increased proton leak will increase oxygen consumption (uncoupled respira - tion, UCR) and the energy will be dissipated as heat instead of being trapped as useful energy. Metabolic normalization of cancer cells and concomitant in - hibition of carcinogenesis may potentially also be attained by induction of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial correc - tion. Moreover, studying the role of mitochondria in cancer cell de-differentiation/differentiation processes may allow further in - sight into the pathophysiology of transformation, and could lead to the development of new cancer therapies. Increases in mi - tochondrial respiration, restoration of mitochondrial membrane potential, increases the population doubling times, and reduc - tion of cell proliferation may be important steps in overcoming the cancer state. By restoring failing mitochondrial energetics cancer morphogenesis may be reversed. An example of the process of cancer re-dif ferentiation via mitochondrial correction is the repair of aconitase International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4tion using frataxin that reverses cell transformation (Schulz et al., 2006; Ristow et al., 2002). Aconitase stereo-specific to isocitrate the cycle within the mitochondria. Frataxin, a highly conserved pro-tein found in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, is required for ef-ficient regulation of cellular iron homeostasis and functions to activates mitochondrial energy conversion and Frataxin functions as activator of oxida-tive phosphorylation, leading to an increased mitochondrial membrane potential and an elevated cellular ATP content. Additional evidence exist showing that normalizing mito - chondrial function is capable of suppressing tumorigenesis. The strongest evidence that cancer may be a mitochondri-al disease has been demonstrated by nuclear-cytoplasm transfer studies. Many of these studies, even those done in cell cybrids, have shown that a nucleus from a malignant cell when placed in a cell with normal cytoplasm will not produce malignant daughter cells; (i.e., mutations in nuclear DNA are insufficient to cause cancer when placed within a normal - ly functioning cellular context with normal mitochondria). It was also shown that normal cell nuclei could not suppress tumorigenecity when placed in tumor cell cytoplasm, (i.e., in the context of dysfunctional metabolism and mitochon - dria, cancer can be induced despite normal nuclear DNA). Therefore, in these studies, normal nuclear gene expression was unable to suppress malignancy. These studies showed that it was the cytoplasm and not the nucleus that dictated the malignant state of the cell (McKinnell, Deggins & La - bat, 1969; Mintz gh, 2012; Elliott, Jiang & Head, 2015; Parikh et al., 2009). If this is the case, and tumor cells are defective as War- burg suggested, then malignant suppression should result from the introduction of normal mitochondria from normal cells to a malignant cell. Indeed these nuclear-cytoplasmic transfer studies in various cell types confirm that the integ - rity of mitochondrial respiration prevents carcinogenesis. In other words, cancer arises from respiratory insufficiency just as Warburg postulated many decades ago (John, 2001). In summary, the origin of tumorigenesis requires damaged or ineffective mitochondria in the cytoplasm. Normal isolated mitochondria co-cultured with cancer cells could be taken into the cancer cells, where they can then reverse aerobic glycolysis and inhibit cell growth (Anand et al., 2008; Shan- 200 8). Mitochondrial Correction The first step in correcting damaged mitochondria involves addressing lifestyle factors. Studies show that increasing physical activity improves mitochondrial function, so encour-aging regular moderate exercise is essential (Anand et al., 2008; Klement & K\u00e4mmerer, 2011; Seyfried, 2015). Com-bining exercise with a diet rich in organic vegetables and moderated in organic, grass-fed meats, free range poultry and wild caught fish and very low in refined carbs and sugar may be essential. In addition, implementing reduced stress practices, such as meditation or yoga, as well as ensuring good sleeping habits are also important. Finally, detoxifying the body by removing fat-stored xenobiotics that inhibit mi - tochondrial function while replacing essential components should substantially help improve mitochondrial function. When the mitochondria become unable to adequately perform their functions, cells will either die, become dormant, or undergo malignant transformation. The possibility exists to cause such cells to revert to normal aerobic cells, capable of normal function via metabolic and mitochondrial correc - tion, which can be accomplished in a number of ways. The current genocentric pharmacologic approach has been to kill such cells with toxic therapies chemotherapy and radiation rather than attempt to reconvert them back to normal func-tion. This cytotoxic approach has been largely unsuccessful, therefore, considering other paradigms that yield alternative approaches may prove to be useful and less damaging. Diet Nutrition is an important part of cancer treatment because the components of the diet are determinants of cell function-ality. For cancer patients, eating the right kinds of foods can help them feel better, stay stronger and most importantly, survive the disease. All tumors depend heavily on glucose for survival. Research shows a strong connection between high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), diabetes, and cancer. High blood glucose raises insulin levels. High blood glucose also raises levels of Insulin-like Growth Factor 1 (IGF-1). Cancer cells with receptors on their surfaces for IGF-1 grow more rapidly because IGF-1 activates metabolic 2007). Studies have consistently estimated that 30% or more of all cancers may be due to dietary factors (Anand et al., 2008). Bioactive food components that affect various as - pects of metabolism may be important tools to reverse gly - colytic to oxidative metabolism and enhance sensitivity to apoptosis. The success of such a strategy may depend on several factors, acting in concert. Glycolytic metabolism and the associated metabolic reprogramming not only support rapid growth of cancer cells, but they also make the cancer cells less dependent of oxygen availability and generate a favorable (acidic) micro-environment. Inhibition of glycolysis may have therapeutic implications in cancer treatment as a strategy to suppress or even eliminate cancer cells. Such a 5 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4strategy may also make use of bioactive food components. One class of bioactive food components that affect energy metabolism and may have anti-cancer effects are polyphe - nols. Quercetin, a polyphenol present in apples, onions, tea and wine, affects energy metabolism. Another polyphenol with anti-cancer potential is resveratrol. Resveratrol is well known as a compound that is present in red wine. Bioac-tive food molecules, that affect energy metabolism, may also function as anti-cancer agents using mechanisms dis - tinct from their effect on energy metabolism. Despite be-ing categorized as antioxidants, most dietary anti-oxidant compounds exhibit their functional effects through specific cellular mechanisms, rather than though general, direct an-ti-oxidants effects. Mechanisms such as cancer cell growth limitation, anti-angiogenesis and normalization of the glyco - lytic metabolism are possible. Carbohydrates provide rapidly usable cellular energy but, unlike proteins and fat, also stimulate potent insulin signals that can be powerful mitogens. A carbohydrate-restricted diet will slow cancer growth in patients by decreasing the secretion and circulating levels of insulin. Tumor glucose up-take can be stabilized and decreased with a carbohydrate restricted diet. Hyperglycemia activates monocytes and macrophages to produce inflammatory cytokines that play an important role in the progression of cancer (Shanmugam, Reddy, Guha & Natarajan, 2003, 1983). High plasma glucose concentrations elevate the lev - els of circulating insulin and free IGF1, two potent anti-apop-totic and growth factors for most cancer cells (Pollak, 2008). Paleolithic-type diets that by definition exclude grain products, have been shown to improve glycemic control therefore are expected to help against cancer. A low carbo - hydrate, high fat diet to increase the blood levels of ketones, along with supplements or foods rich in citric acid, can impair glycolysis and may prove a beneficial adjunct in the treat-ment of many cancers (Klement & K\u00e4mmerer, 2011). A ketogenic diet characterized by minimal carbohydrate intake, a moderate amount of protein , and higher amounts of fat seems to limit cancer cell growth. This shift in macronutri - ents causes the body to switch to utilizing ketones (produced by burning fats) instead of glucose as its primary source of fuel. Ketones (e.g., acetoacetate, \u00df-hydroxybutyric acid and acetone) are produced in the liver when lipids are burned instead of glucose. Low-carbohydrate diets reduce the ex-treme glucose peaks and help patients avoid both hypergly-cemia and rebound hypoglycemia, providing more sustained energy throughout the day. Ketones are efficiently used for the generation of ATP (energy) in mitochondria. Cancer cells cannot use ketones as an energy source (Zhou et al., 2007). The ketogenic diet mimics the metabolic state of starvation, forcing the body to utilize fat as its primary source of energy. The Ketogenic diet may be beneficial in optimizing mito - chondrial function. The transition from glucose metabolism to ketone metabolism is also a powerful anti-inflammato - ry strategy. The goal of this diet is to shift the body from burning mostly glucose (sugar) to burning mostly ketones (fat). The quickest way to get into the therapeutic zone is to start by fasting (water only) for 3-5 days. During the induc - tion phase, carbohydrate withdrawal symptoms may occur, which typically include lightheadedness, nausea, and head-aches (Keto Flu). An alternative to this fasting is to limit car-bohydrates to less than 12 grams per day and limit protein to 0.8 to 1.2 grams per kg body weight per day (0.4 to 0.6 grams per pound body weight). With this less extreme plan, patients may need up to several weeks to reach the rec - ommended therapeutic zone values. Ketogenic diets may also facilitate easier surgical reduction in tumor burden, as ketosis can reduce blood vessel mass, inflammation, and tumor size; thereby facilitating surgical removal of the tumor mass. The increase of ketones in the blood can also inhibit the activity of phosphofructokinase, an enzyme that plays a key role in the regulation of glycolysis. Citric acid, an inter-mediary product of the Krebs cycle metabolism, has also been reported to block the actions of phosphofructokinase. To support mitochondrial function, our patients are ad - vised to eat 8-12 servings daily of a variety of whole, colorful vegetables and fruits; among different plants, color variation indicates phytochemical variety, thereby allowing the diet to provide a wide range of anticancer and metabolism-en - hancing phytochemicals. Vegetables should be the primary focus, especially the bitter foods in the cruciferous family (such as broccoli, watercress and arugula), as these foods provide numerous anticancer benefits. Coconut oil, a brain-healthy saturated fat that contains medium-chain triglycer-ides (MCTs), also supports mitochondrial function via pro-duction of ketones. Calorie and carbohydrate restriction, along with eating lean, clean (pesticide and toxin-free) proteins, high-quality fats and oils, and more plant foods may help to prevent or slow down all degenerative diseases. All grains are mini-mized or avoided on a Mitochondria restoration diet in order to achieve the desired goals of mild ketosis and low glyce - mic impact. Most malignant cells lack key mitochondrial en - zymes necessary for conversion of ketone bodies fatty ATP (Pollak, 2008; Seyfried, 2015; Tisdale & Bren-nan, 1983). Maintaining a lower and consistent insulin level is key to optimal mitochondrial health. A heavily processed, high-gly - cemic load diet of too many grains and added sugars can lead to increased insulin and inflammation with associated 6 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4and accelerated mitochondrial dysfunction. Minimizing grains, especially highly processed ones, and using low-glycemic vegetables and fruits as the main source of carbohydrates helps to stabilize blood sugar and protect mitochondria. High quality proteins are the best choice, including grass- fed, organic, non-genetically modified organism (GMO) sources. For fish, patients should choose wild-caught salmon as farmed salmon may contain hormones and tox-ic chemicals. We encourage the consumption of minimally refined, cold-pressed, organic, non GMO fats and liquid oils whenever possible. When possible, we advise phytonutri - ent-dense, unfiltered, extra-virgin olive oil, Avocado oil or Coconut oil, add to dress salads and vegetables. Medium Chain Triglycerides (MCT) oil is another option that can also be used for cooking and for dressings. Cancer patients should aim for a minimum of 4-6 serv - ings of organic vegetables every day (ideally, 10-12 servings per day). A serving is only \u00bd cup of cooked vegetable or 1 cup of raw leafy greens. Patients get four servings of vegetables in one meal, by filling your plate with vegetables or eating a hearty salad. All greens (including collard, dandelion, kale, mustard, and turnip greens), along with chard/Swiss chard, spinach, sea vegetables, and the many green vegetables in the cruciferous family have been found to support the mitochondria via effects such as antioxidant protection, anti-inflammatory benefits and enhancement of xenobiotic clearance. Patients are instructed to eat a rainbow of colors: red peppers, tomatoes, and radishes; orange carrots, peppers, and pumpkin; yellow summer squash and peppers; green asparagus, avocado, and green beans; blue/purple egg - plant and cabbage; and white/tan mushrooms, jicama, and onions. Patients are also counsel to purchase organic veg - etables (and fruits) when possible. Foods should be \"or - ganic\" grown without chemical pesticides; given that many mitochondrial toxins, carcino - gens and endocrine disruptors. Fruits with a low to moderate glycemic response can be consumed when patients are feeling the need for something sweet. All berries along with pomegranate seeds and grapes with the skin have shown to increase levels of glutathione in the body. Fruit juices are not encouraged as they are dense sources of sugar and can increase blood sugar levels, there - by promoting oxidative stress, immunosuppression and hy-perinsulinemia. Patients should to drink plenty of pure, filtered water dai - ly. It is generally recommended to drink at least six to eight glasses. (One glass = 1 cup = 8 ounces). For variety and additional antioxidant and anticancer benefits, patients con-sider adding at least 2 cups of green tea daily with the gen-eral recommendation being Include herbal teas, especial-ly those prepared from adaptogenic herbs like cordyceps, schizandra, ginseng, astragalus, and licorice can be used as desired and tolerated. The importance of pesticide and toxin-free food from local, free-range, grass-fed, and organic sources cannot be stressed enough. Dietary Supplementation: Descriptions and $GXOW\u0003'RVHV Several supplements are important in any regimen de - signed to boost mitochondrial health (Zhou, 2007). Dietary supplements can reduce the oxidative burden of ATP gener-ation, provide additional substrate for oxidative phosphoryl-ation, and repair leaky membranes which interrupt the elec-tron transport system. In addition, mitochondrial biogenesis, or the generation of new mitochondria , - ical for the transport of electrons from complexes I and II to complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Further-more, CoQ is essential for the stability of complex III in the mitochondrial respiratory chain, functions as an antioxidant in cell membranes, and is involved in multiple aspects of cellular metabolism. CoQ10 also reduces lactic acid levels, improves muscle strength, and decreases muscle fatigabili-ty. CoQ10 protects against beta-amyloid-induced mitochon - drial malfunction. Statin drugs are thought to cause mito - chondrial damage in part by lowering levels of CoQ10, and supplementation with CoQ10 has been shown to counteract some of the negative effects of statins and is an important supplement to counteract the adverse effects of cancer ther - apy (Conklin & Nicolson, 2008). CoQ10 is probably the most widely used cofactor for treating mitochondrial-related dis-eases. CoQ10 is also a strong antioxidant in its reduced form, and it can affect the expression of certain genes in-volved in cell signaling, metabolism, and transport. Howev - er, the main role of CoQ10 is its involvement in the transfer of electrons along the multiple complexes of the mitochon - drial electron transport chain. In combination with lipoic acid, CoQ10 may have had the ability to increase ATP production, resulting in decreased utilization of alternative energy sourc-es and a decrease in resting plasma lactate concentrations (Zhou et al., 2007; Rodriguez et al., 2007). 8ELTXLQRQH 100 mg tid. L-Carnitine (3-hydroxy-4--trimethylaminobutyrate) L-carnitine is a naturally occurring fatty acid transporter. It is directly involved in the transport of fatty acids into the mitochondrial matrix for subsequent -oxidation, but it also functions in removal of excess acyl groups from the body 7 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4and in the modulation of intracellular coenzyme A (CoA) homeostasis. L-carnitine helps fatty acids cross the in - ner mitochondrial membrane to be used as energy. It also scavenges reactive oxygen and binds iron. L-carnitine also has been shown to prevent the damaging effects of statins on the mitochondria. L-carnitine protects against mitochondrial dysfunction associated with oxidative stress caused by a series of conditions such as aging, ischemia reperfusion, inflammation, degenerative diseas - es, cancer and drug toxicity (Nicolson, 2014a; Rodriguez et al., 2007; Nicolson, 2013). L-carnitine has been used to increase the rate of mitochondrial oxidative phosphoryla - tion. L-carnitine also is essential for the detoxification of environmental pollutants, meaning it can protect the mito - chondria on a number of levels. /\u0010&DUQLWLQe 500 bid\u0011Acetyl-L-Carnitine Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCar) is an ester of the trimethylat - ed amino acid L- carnitine , and it is better absorbed and more efficiently crosses the blood-brain barrier as compared to L-carnitine. Dietary supplementation with Acetyl-L-Carni - tine might reverse age-related mitochondrial changes. AL - Car helps to restore mitochondrial membrane potential and Cardiolipin levels. Cardiolipin is an important component of the inner mitochondrial membrane, and it constitutes about 20% of the total lipid composition. ALCar facilitates fatty acid transport into mitochondria, and it increases overall cellu - lar respiration. ALCar enhances cognitive performance, in-creased production of neurotransmitters, and helps restores levels of certain hormone receptors to more youthful levels. ALCar reverses many aspects of age-related cellular dys - function, principally through maintenance of mitochondrial function (Ames & Liu, 2004). $FHW\\O\u0010/\u0010&DUQLWLQH 250 mg bid\u0011Idebenone (2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-(10-hydroxyde - cyl)-1,4-benzoquinone) Idebenone is a CoQ10 analog that, while sharing some of CoQ10s properties, offers unique mitochondrial-protec - tive benefits on its own. Idebenone is a powerful mitochon - drial free radical quencher that reduces the ever-increasing damage to mitochondrial membrane and DNA that occurs with age. Idebenone has also been shown to be more effec - tive than CoQ10 in protecting the electron transport chain. When cellular oxygen levels are low, idebenone is actually superior to CoQ10 for preventing free radical damage while helping cells maintain relatively normal ATP levels (Giorgio et al., 2012). ,GHEHQRQe 150 mg qd\u0011N-Acetyl Cysteine N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) is the acetylated precursor of both the amino acid L-cysteine and reduced glutathione (GSH). A major cause of mitochondrial dysfunction is due to changes that take place in the respiratory chain where oxidative phosphorylation occurs. NAC has a positive ef - fect on key elements of the respiratory chain. It increases the activities of mitochondrial Complexes I, IV and V. NAC also helps maintain levels of glutathione, an important anti - oxidant capable of preventing damage to important cellular components caused by reactive oxygen species. NAC pro-tects cells by promoting oxidative phosphorylation, Lipoic acid) Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is potent antioxidant, transi - tion metal ion chelator, redox transcription regulator, and anti-inflammatory agent. It acts as a critical cofactor in mitochondrial -keto acid dehydrogenases, and thus it is important in mitochondrial oxidative-decarboxylation reac - tions. ALA is an amphipathic molecule with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties. This makes ALA a perfect mol - ecule to establish communication between the cytoplasm and mitochondria. ALA acid may also have mitochondrial resuscitating properties. By providing ALA for two weeks mitochondrial oxygen consumption was completely re - stored. It was also found that ALA, like ALCar, increased mitochondrial membrane potential of by up to 50 percent. ALA supplementation also increased mitochondrial glu - tathione and vitamin C concentrations, indicating ALA may have the ability to reverse the age-associated decline in low molecular weight antioxidants, therefore reducing the risk for oxidative damage that occurs with aging. ALA sup - plementation improves mitochondrial function, alleviates some of the age-related loss of metabolic activity, increas-es ATP synthesis and aortic blood flow, and increases glu - cose uptake. Furthermore ALA supplementation may be a safe and effective means to improve general metabolic function (Hagen et al., 1999). 5 \u0003$OSKD\u0003/LSRLF\u0003$FLG 300 mg bid\u0011Omega 3 Fatty Acids (Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) Omega-3 fatty acids from fish oils are cardio-protective.

Also related to Vitamin C's electron moving ability it may be considered an ergogenic aid (Gonzalez, Miranda & Riordan, 2005). Vitamin C is taken up by the mitochondria and is able to preserve mitochondrial membrane potential (Gonzalez et al., 2010; Ohta, 2012; Heaney et al., 2008). Even modest blood glucose elevations as they typically occur after a Western diet meal competitively impair the transport of ascorbic acid into immune cells (Ohta, 2012; Heaney et al., 2008).

Phospholipids Phospholipids are an important class of lipids found in all cellular membranes. Glycerolphospholipids, the type of phospholipid found in cellular and intracellular membranes, are made up of two fatty acids (long chains of hydrogen and carbon molecules), which are attached to a glycerol 'head.' The glycerol molecule is also attached to a phosphate group, and this is the hydrophilic part of the molecule. The glycerolphospholipids help cellular membranes and act not only as diffusion barriers but also as dynamic cell organelles, contributing to the synthesis of intracellular mediators, such as arachidonic acid and inositol phosphates. Glycerolphos - pholipids interact and work with integral membrane proteins to modulate various cellular activities. As membrane phos - pholipids are known to be essential to cellular membrane function and cell viability, their modification and restoration by exogenous dietary phospholipids remains a useful ap - proach for maintaining and restoring cellular membrane function. Cell membranes control a variety of cellular processes , as well as the maintenance of a structural and ionic barri - ers and intercellular communication networks (as mentioned above). They are also involved in cell transport, secretion, recognition, adhesion and other important cell functions. Membrane lipids provide at least four major requirements for cellular health. They are used as: (1) an important en - ergy storage reservoir; (2) the matrix for all cellular mem-branes, enabling separation of enzymatic and chemical reactions into discrete cellular compartments; (3) bioactive molecules in certain signal transduction and molecular rec-ognition pathways; and (4) important functional molecules that undergo interactions with other cellular constituents, such as proteins and glycoproteins. This latter characteristic is an absolute requirement for the formation, structure and activities of biological membranes (Nicolson, contribute to the physicochemical properties of the membrane and thus influence the conformation and function of membrane-bound proteins, such as receptors, ion chan - nels, enzymes, and transporters, and they also influence cell function by serving as precursors for prostaglandins and other signaling molecules. Finally, they can modulating gene expression through the activation of transcription. One of the fundamental biochemical differences between tumor cells and normal cells is the composition of the mem - brane lipid matrix, including glycophospholipids and other lipids and their oxidation state. Membrane peroxidation can modify phospholipid structure, affecting lipid fluidity, per-meability and membrane function (Nicolson Ash, 2014; Nicolson 2016; In addition, the in-tracellular trafficking of phospholipids, which plays a crucial role in phospholipid homeostasis, can also be modified by peroxidation events. In the mitochondria the activities of the enzymes involved in cellular respiration are markedly influ-enced by the composition and oxidation state of the phos-pholipid s of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Oxidation of inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipids can result in increased leakiness of the inner mitochondrial membrane. Leaky mitochondrial membranes cause mitochondrial im - pairment and loss in the production of ATP. When there is progressive functional loss of mitochondrial function, such as in the excessive oxidative modification of the mitochon-drial membrane phospholipids, can cause changes in health that could progress to disease. The outer mitochondrial membrane encloses the entire organelle and has a protein-to-phospholipid ratio similar to that of eukaryotic plasma membranes. The outer mitochon - drial membrane contains transport proteins called porins (K\u00fchlbrandt, 2015). The inner mitochondrial membrane is rich in the phospholipid cardiolipin, which is characteristic of the bacterial plasma membrane and is important in electron transport function and provides yet more evidence suggest - ing the mitochondrion's bacterial origin. Maintenance of the appropriate phospholipid composition in the mitochondrial membranes is essential for mitochon - drial structure and function. Thus, mitochondria depend on phospholipid metabolism, the transport of phospholipids into mitochondria, and supply of appropriate lipids from the diet . Regulation of the synthesis, trafficking, and degradation of phospholipids is essential to maintain phospholipid home - ostasis in the mitochondria. An important element of phos - pholipid homeostasis is that the phospholipids in the mito- chondria can be modified by dietary glycerolphospholipids and fatty acids. Membrane Lipid Replacem ent (MLR), the use of function - al oral supplements containing cell membrane glycerolphos - pholipids and antioxidants, can safely replace damaged membrane phospholipids. Most if not all clinical conditions are characterized by membrane phospholipid oxidative damage, resulting in loss of membrane and cellular func-tion (Nicolson & Ash, Orally ingested phospholipids can be degraded into their constituent parts and absorbed; they can be taken in as intact molecules without degradation, or they can be ab - sorbed as small phospholipid droplets and micelles (Nicol - Ash, 2014; Nicolson et al., 2016; Nicolson, 2014b). Eventually they are delivered to tissues and cells where they are transferred by membrane contact and carrier or trans - port proteins to various cellular and organelle membranes. MLR plus antioxidants has been used to reverse ROS/ RNS damage and increase mitochondrial function in certain 10 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4clinical disorders, such as chronic fatigue, CFS and Fibromy - Nicolson, 2014b). In these disorders MLR has been found to be effective in preventing ROS/RNS-associated changes and reversing mitochondrial damage and loss of function (Nicolson & Ash, 2014 ). MLR is possible because cellular lipids are in dynamic equilibrium in the body. Thus functional oral MLR supplements containing cell membrane glycerolphospholipids and antioxi - dants, has been used to replace damaged, usually oxidized, membrane glycerophospholipids that accumulate during aging and in various clinical conditions. Once delivered to membrane sites, they naturally replace and stimulate removal of damaged membrane lipids. Various chronic clinical conditions are char - acterized by membrane damage, mainly oxidative but also enzymatic, resulting in loss of cellular function. This is readily apparent in mitochondrial inner membranes where oxidative damage to phospholipids like cardiolipin and other molecules results in loss of transmembrane potential, electron transport function and generation of high-energy molecules. Phospholipids (mixed): 1g tid (Salisburia Adiantifolia) Ginkgo biloba is one of the oldest living tree species. It is also one of the best-selling herbal supplements in the United States and Europe. Ginkgo leaves contain flavonoids and terpenoids. A growing volume of data confirms that Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) reduces oxidative (Eckert, 2012). Ginkgo biloba ex-tract has been found protect mitochondrial against oxidative damage and oxidation of mitochondrial (Succinic acid)Succinate is a tricarboxylic acid (Krebs) cycle intermediate that donates electrons directly to Complex II. Succinates have been widely used for their alleged ability to enhance athletic performance (Sastre, Pallardo, De la Asuncion & Vina, 2000; Nowak, Clifton & Bakajsova, 2008). Succinate Ameliorates Energy Deficits (Nowak, Clifton & Bakajsova, 2008). It seems that the use of succinates is even more effective when a balance of several salts is used, especially combinations of magnesium and potassium. Succinate: 125 mg qd.Pyrroloquinoline Quinone (PQQ) PQQ is a small molecule that has act as a Redox agent in cells, it can modify cell signaling and support mitochondrial function. PQQ is reported to participate in a range of bio - logical functions. PQQ protects mitochondria from oxidative stress. It also promotes the spontaneous generation of new mitochondria, a process known as Quinone: 20 mg qd.Sodium Bicarbonate bicarbonate composed of sodium ions and bicarbonate ions. The glycolytic nature of malignant tumors contributes to high levels of extracellular acidity in the tumor microenvironment. The extracellular pH of malignant tumors is acidic (pH 6.5-6.9) compared to nor - mal tissue (pH 7.2-7.4). Tumor acidity is a driving force for cellular division, invasion and metastases (Griffiths, 1991; Vaupel, Kallinowski & Reinhold, 1984; Robey & Martin, 2011). Recently, it has been shown that buffering of extracellular acidity through systemic administration of oral bicarbonate may inhibit the spread of metastases. Dose to individualized effect to achieve urine pH of 7.5-8, while not consuming excess sodium. Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide (NADH) NADH functions as a cellular redox cofactor in over 200 cellular redox reactions and as substrate for certain en - zymes. NADH delivers electrons from metabolite hydroly - sis to the electron transport chain, but in its reduced form, it can also act as a strong antioxidant. Pyruvate is converted to lactate, which requires all the glycolytic NADH output to be converted to NAD+, and this lactate is then excreted from the cell . Thus, aerobic glycolysis does not produce any net output of NADH. NADH can be successfully ad - ministered orally or by intravenous/intraperitoneal infusion (Rex, Hentschke & Fink, 2002). NADH: 20 mg qd.D-Ribose Ribose is a naturally occurring 5-carbon sugar produced in the body from glucose. In addition to serving as the car - bohydrate backbone for ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deox- yribonucleic acid (DNA), ribose is also an essential ingre - dient in the manufacture of ATP. Thus ribose provides the key building block of ATP. The mitochondria of high-energy output organs such as the heart, liver, adrenals, GI tract, brain, muscles and endocrine glands utilize two methods 11 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4for building or conserving cyclic nucleotides like ATP, ADP and AMP. The first process by which these nucleotides are synthesized is the de novo pathway, in which nucleotides are made using ribose. This is the slower of the two path - ways. The second or faster pathway is the salvage path - way, in which the mitochondria pick up ATP metabolites to form new ATP. In this manner ribose enables the cells to more quickly and efficiently recycle (i.e., salvage) the end products formed by the breakdown of ATP to form new ATP molecules. Thus, the ribose salvage pathway is known as the salvage pathway of ATP formation. Ribose is essential for both the salvage and de novo reactions to work, and it is formed in the body from glucose, through the pentose phosphate pathway. Aside from this relatively time-consum - ing pathway, there are no foods that are able to provide enough ribose to rapidly restore ribose levels, should the need arise, as when exercising or working, and especially during a heart attack or stroke. D-ribose is another excellent addition to the mitochon - drial resuscitation regimen. D-ribose reduces markers of oxidative stress that can form after high-intensity exercise (Seifert et al., 2009). It also boosts post-exercise ATP levels (Dhanoa & Housner, 2007) and has shown to have beneficial effects in heart disease patients (MacCarter et al., 2009). D-ribose replenishes low myocardial energy levels, improving cardiac dysfunction following ischemia. Studies also have shown it can improve ventilation effi - ciency in patients with heart failure (Seifert et al., 2009). The presence of ribose in the cell stimulates the meta - bolic pathway to actually produce ATP. If the cell does not have enough ribose, it cannot make ATP. Oral or intravenous ribose has been found to rapidly restore ribose levels in nerves and muscles. Ribose sup - plementation can dramatically improve recovery of failing ATP levels during and following acute or chronic anoxia or ischemia. Research has shown that taking ribose has a positive effect on ATP production in all muscle fiber types, especially the heart. Ribose supplementation increases the de novo production of ATP through oxidative phospho - rylation by more than 300 percent. Ribose also activates the salvage pathway, causing nucleotides to be revitalized into the manufacture of ATP by over 500 percent (Berg, Tymoczko & Stryer, 2002). Ribose has also been shown to increase athletic perfor - mance. Supplementation (ten grams per day) in young male recreational bodybuilders resulted in significant increases in muscular strength and total work performance after four weeks, compared with pre-treatment levels. No changes were noted in those using a placebo (Van Gammeren, Falk & Antonio, 2002). D-Ribose: 5g qd.Citrate A citrate is a derivative of citric acid. Citric acid is a weak organic tricarboxylic acid. It occurs naturally in citrus fruits. It is an intermediate in the citric acid cycle, which occurs in the metabolism of all aerobic organisms. Citrate inhibits the phosphofructokinase enzyme blocking glycolysis enzyme. These citrate or citric acid properties have the capacity to inhibit glycolysis and a step in Krebs cycle; the citrate inhibits three base enzymes in the mitochondrial metabolism of Krebs cycle (Tornheim & Lowenstein, No suggested dose.Creatine Creatine is an essential, natural substance that is synthe - sized in the body from three amino acids: glycine, arginine, and methionine. Creatine plays a very powerful role in en - ergy metabolism as a muscle fuel in its role in regenerating ATP. Creatine combines with phosphate in the mitochondria to form phosphocreatine. It serves as a source of high-en-ergy phosphate, released during anaerobic metabolism. It also acts as an intracellular buffer for ATP and as an energy shuttle for the movement of high-energy phosphates from mitochondrial sites of production to cytoplasmic uti-lization (Keys, 1943; Kreider et al., et & Yuaspelkis, et through the ATP/ADP cycle, creatine phosphate maintains ATP levels by serving as a reservoir of high-energy phosphate bonds in muscle and nerve tissues. The energy required to rephosphorylate ADP into ATP depends on the amount of phosphocreatine (PCr) stored in muscle tissues. As phosphocreatine is de-pleted during exercise, energy availability declines due to a loss of ability to resynthesize ATP at the rate required. In 19 43, it was shown that creatine supplementation ex- tended the cycling times of athletes (Keys, 1943). Creatine enhances both strength and endurance in athletes (Keys, 1943; Kreider et al., 1998; Vandenberghe et al., & Yuaspelkis, et & Jimenez, 2012). Some researchers have shown strength gains with as little as five to seven days of supplementa - tion (Cooper, Naclerio, Allgrove & Jimenez, 2012). In a dou - ble blind study that examined the effects of creatine in a 12 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4weight training program in men over 70 It was shown that creatine had a significant advantage over placebo in terms of increased lean body mass, reduction in body fat, and in - creased muscular strength, and endurance (Cooke et al., 2014; Tarnopolsky, 2000). In Italy, physicians administered six grams of creatine each day to 13 patients hospitalized with congestive heart failure. After four days, they noted a reduction in heart size, reduced vascular resistance, and increased ejection fraction, all indicators of improved heart function (Ferraro et al., 1996). In a review article, Tarnopolsky concluded that creatine monohydrate supplementation results in an increase in skel - etal muscle total and phosphocreatine concentrations, in - creased fat-free mass, and enhanced high-intensity exercise performance in young healthy men and women (Tarnopolsky, 2000). He also noted neuroprotective effects, which have been proposed to be of benefit in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, ALS, and after ischemia. He concluded that creatine appeared to have potential to attenuate age-related muscle at - rophy and strength loss, as well as to protect against neurode - generative disorders. The U.S. FDA has granted orphan drug status to creatine as a treatment for patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), based on creatine's demonstrated ability to enhance cellular energy production. In addition, a European patent has also recently been issued for the use of creatine compounds to prevent aging effects and to treat muscle atrophy (Hespel, 2000). Creatine: 5g qd.Shilajit Shilajit is a thick, sticky tar-like substance with a color ranging from white to dark brown (the latter is more common) found predominately in Himalaya and Tibet mountain s. It is an ancient Indian adaptogen. Shilajit enhances CoQ10's mito - chondrial benefits and supports levels of the active ubiquinol form. Components of shilajit can serve as electron reservoirs, replenishing electrons lost by CoQ10 and allowing this vital coenzyme to remain active longer (Surapaneni, 2012). Shalajit: 200 mg qd.Mushrooms Coriolus versicolor (T urkey tail), is a mushroom of the Basidiomycetes class from which the extracts Polysaccha- ride-K and Polysaccharide-Peptide (PSK, PSP, respectively) have demonstrated to inhibit various carcinomas in animals and humans. This is achieved by inducing apoptosis and activating a cascade of pathways involving the activation of p38 MAPK signaling cascades and over-expression of pro-apoptotic protein Bax (Kobayashi, Matsunaga & Oguchi, 1995). PSK was approved for clinical use in various cancers in Japan in the 1980s. Other mushrooms that seem to have analogous effects on mitochondria are Reishi (Ganoderma edodes; Fang et et al., 2015), Chaga et al., 2011), Lion's Mane (Hericium erinaceus; Kim, Nam & Friedman, 2013). Mushrooms: No herbs chinensis (Panossian & Wikman, 2008) have shown certain capacity to activate synthesis and resynthesis of ATP.

Melatonin Melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) is a methox - yindole, the pineal gland of verte- brates through a multistep process starting from hydroxyl - ation of tryptophan and culminating with transformation of serotonin to N-acetyl serotonin followed by methylation to the final substance melatonin. Melatonin is a ubiquitous mol-ecule with a variety of functions including potent reductive properties. Due to its lipophilic character, it easily crosses cellular and intracellular membranes and reaches all sub - cellular organelles. Melatonin has been shown to protect the bio-energetic function of mitochondria (Acu\u00f1a-Castro - viejo et 10 mg qd before sleep.Arginine Arginine is a basic amino acid and is classified as a con - ditionally essential amino acid. One of the main functions of arginine is its participation in protein synthesis. Arginine is utilized by a number of metabolic pathways that produce a variety of biologically nitric is involved in a number of roles in the body such as the detoxification of ammonia formed dur - ing the nitrogen catabolism of amino acids via the formation 13 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4of urea; its potential to be converted to glucose (hence its classification as a glycogenic amino acid); and its ability to be catabolized to produce energy (Nagaya et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2016). Many of the benefits of arginine stem from its ability to generate nitric oxide, aided by an enzyme called nitric oxide synthase. Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a signaling molecule that induces smooth muscle cells to relax, expand - ing the blood vessels (vasodilation), blood pressure drops and blood flow is improved. More blood is delivered to the tissues, which are then better nourished with oxygen.

Among these, quercetin can impact mitochondrial biogenesis by modulating enzymes and transcription factors. Quercetin is now recognized as a phytochemical that can modulate associated with (GSH) is the major intracellular thiol com - pound, is an ubiquitous tripeptide produced by most mam- malian cells and it is the main mechanism of antioxidant defense against reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elec-trophiles. GSH versatility permits it to counteract hydrogen peroxide, lipid hydroperoxides, or xenobiotics, mainly as a cofactor of enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase or glutathione-S-transferase (GST). GSH (-glutamyl-cystei-nyl-glycine) serves a of antioxidant and detoxifying enzymes. GSH in the mitochondrial matrix plays a key role in defense against respiration-induced ROS and in the detoxification of lipid hydroperoxides and electro - philes. Moreover, as mitochondria play a central strategic role in the activation and mode of cell death, mitochondrial GSH has been shown to critically regulate the level of sen - sitization to secondary hits that induce mitochondrial mem-brane permeabilization and release of proteins confined in the intermembrane space necessary to induce cell death (apoptosis; Ribas, Garc\u00eda-Ruiz & Fern\u00e1ndez-Checa, 2014). Oral efficiently in - crease intracellular glutathione levels, it can be absorbed intact into the blood stream. Since increased glutathione levels in the blood have been shown to slow the breakdown of nitric oxide, glutathione supplementation may be useful to augment nitric oxide boosters such as L-Citrulline or L-Ar - ginine. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a prodrug for L-cysteine, which is used for the intention of allowing more glutathione to be produced when it would normally be depleted. Through glutathione buffering, NAC provides antioxidative effects and other benefits, so is both more efficient and cheaper than glutathione. Liposome-encapsulated glutathione (Ly-po-GSH) seems to be a more effective way to supplement this nutrient. Glutathione: 250 mg qd.Dichloroacetate (DCA) DCA drug. It activates the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by inhibiting the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, which normally phospho - rylates and inhibits the enzyme. The ability of DCA to keep the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in an active state re - duces the accumulation of lactate in body tissues (Parikh from aerobic glycolysis to oxidative respira - tion. This drug induced apoptosis of cancer cells (Bonnet et al., 2007) by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, blocking aerobic glycolysis (Warburg effect), and activating mitochondrial potassium-ion channels (Khan, Marier, Mars-den, Andrews & Eliaz, 2014). Other mechanisms of DCA ac-tion against cancer cells have also been proposed. These include: (a) inhibition of angiogenesis; (b) alteration of ex - pression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1- (HIF1-),21; and (c) alteration of pH regulators vacuolar-type H+-ATPase (V-AT - Pase) and monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1) and other regulators of cell survival, such as p53-upregulated modu - lator of B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein, and cellular tumor anti - gen p53 (127). An oral DCA regimen that included the natural neuropro - tective medications acetyl-L-carnitine, R--lipoic acid, and benfotiamine (DD) has been used clinically. IV DCA up to 100 mg/kg/dose that have confirmed its safety. Shifts in ATP production from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation by inhibition of PDK1 with dichloroacetate (DCA) was shown to 14 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4shift metabolism from glycolysis to glucose oxidation. Treat- ment with DCA increased mitochondrial production of ROS/RNS in all tested cancer cells, but not in normal cells (Mi-chelakis, Webster & Mackey, 2008). It is important to mention that DCA in high doses can damage mitochondria and produce peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy is not uncommon with prolonged DCA treatment. Dichloroacetate: No suggested dose.3-Bromopyruvate Bromopyruvic acid and its alkaline form, bromopyruvate, are synthetic brominated derivatives of pyruvic acid. They are lactic acid and pyruvate analogs. 3-Bromopyruvate (BP) has been shown by others to inhibit hexokinase (Ihrlund, Hern - lund, Khan & Shoshan, 2008). Being a lactate analogue, it is likely taken up by cells via lactate transporters which are overexpressed in tumor cells (Ihrlund, Hernlund, Khan & Sho - shan, 2008). This drug may have significant side effects. 3-Bromopyruvate: No suggested dose.2-Deoxyglucose 2-deoxyglucose (DG) is a non-metabolizable glucose ana - logue. DG is a glucose analogue which is easily taken up by tumor cells via glucose transporters and is then phosphorylat - ed by hexokinase, but it is not further metabolized in the gly - colytic process (Pedersen, 2007). DG will thus titrate endog - enous glucose and thereby block glycolysis (Zhao, Jacobs & Rathmell, 2008; Cantor & Sabatini, 2012). 2-Deoxyglucose: No suggested dose.EPI-743 EPI-743 is a new drug that is based on vitamin E. EPI- 743 is a para-benzoquinone analog. Tests have shown that it can help improve the function of cells with mitochondrial problems. It works by improving the regulation of cellular energy metabolism by targeting an enzyme NADPH quinone oxidoreductase dose.Lifestyle and mitochondriaExercise Dietary interventions are just one part of the overall picture of optimizing mitochondrial function. Other lifestyle consid - erations like exercise, movement, stress and sleep also play a role in mitochondrial health. Exercise and movement has been shown to improve cellular energy production (Sahlin, 2014). Both aerobic and anaerobic exercise should be per - formed on a regular basis. Exercise also has an important role in mitochondrial disease therapy, as it has been shown to reduce the burden of unhealthy mitochondria; increase the percentage of healthy, non-mutated mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA); and improve endurance and muscle function. Suggested exercise, combine aerobic exercises (such as cycling, walking, running, hiking, and playing tennis, basket - ball that focus on increasing cardiovascular endurance) and anaerobic exercises ( such as weight training to increase muscle strength) for 45 min 3x a week. Hyperbaric (high pressure, 100%) Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) Hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT) involves inhaling up to 100% oxygen at a pressure greater than one atmosphere (ATM) in a pressurized chamber. Excess oxygen reduces the activity of an enzyme called hexokinase II, which grabs onto glucose after it enters cells and traps it inside so it can be burned for energy. Also HBOT significantly ameliorates mi - tochondrial dysfunction (Dave Arnold & D'Agostino, 2015). When cells are proliferating and DNA is unwound, unprotected and being replicated: if high ROS levels are sensed at this time, the pro - cess is aborted and the cell can be driven into apoptosis. Treatment: 45 min 1.5-2.5 ATM twice a weekIntravenous Laser Therapy (IVLT) Laser Therapy works on the principle of inducing a biolog - ical response through energy transfer, in that the photonic energy delivered into the tissue by the laser modulate the biological processes within the tissue. Light energy transmit-ted through space as waves that contain tiny \"energy pack-ets\" called photons (Duality). Each photon contains a defi - nite amount of energy depending on its wavelength (color). Intravenous or intravascular laser blood irradiation in- volves the in-vivo illumination of the blood by feeding low level laser light. It is a minimally invasive laser procedure in which a small needle is placed into the vein in the forearm, under the assumption that any therapeutic effect will be cir-culated through the circulatory system. It works similar to photosynthesis; the correct wavelengths and power of light at certain intensities for an appropriate pe-riod of time can increase ATP production and cell membrane alterations could lead to permeability changes and second 15 \u00a9 2018 International Society for Orthomolecular Medicine ISSN 0317-0209Mitochondrial Correction: A New Therapeutic Paradigm for Cancer and Degenerative Diseases VOLUME 33.4messenger activity resulting in functional changes (Ferraresi et al., 2015; Xu, Zhao, Liu & Pan, 2008; Momenzadeh et al., 2015; Huang et al., 2012). Acupuncture treatment (needles in cardinal points), in - creases the patient's energy but only by mobilizing reserve energy (meridians), in contrast Laser therapy introduces ad - ditional energy into the system. Mitochondria are the key to photobiomodulation. The cytochrome c oxidase can absorb red light converting the photonic energy into biological energy ATP. Cytochrome c oxidase is commonly accepted as a photo acceptor that catalyzes cellular level activity when exposed to red to near-infrared red light. The absorption of different colors within the mitochondrial respiratory chain: Complex 1 (NADH dehydrogenase) absorbs blue and ultra- violet light. Complex 3 (cytochrome c reductase) absorbs green and yellow light. Complex 4 (cytochrome c oxidase) absorbs red and infrared light. Mitochondria changed to \"giant mitochondria\" after la - ser-irradiation with activation of various metabolic pathways and increased production of ATP due to activation of the respiratory chain and increased ATP-synthesis. ATP is also used as a signaling molecule in communications between nerve cells and other tissues. There is a normalization of the tissue metabolism due to in - creased O2. There is also an increase of enzymes. An increase of ATP-synthesis occurs with a normalization of cell membrane potential. Irradiation in the red range is effective to increase the absorption spectrum of cytochrome-C-oxidase in the respirato - ry chain with a concomitant stimulation of the ATP-synthesis. There is an increased change of the redox potential in mi - tochondria and cytoplasm by oxidation at the NADH. Thereby the proton motor force is increased which drives the backflow of the protons into the matrix and by doing so increases the ATP turnover. In addition the electron transfer is accelerated, both effects cause an increase of ATP synthesis. IVLT has Pleiotropic action that produces a cascade of events due to increased Energy. Treatment: IVLT 10 min of each color twice a week. This therapy be accompanied by mitochondria-supporting supplements.Conclusions Mitochondrial dysfunction has been identified as one of the principal causes of bioenergetic decline. Although there is no single silver bullet or an exact combination of substanc - es or supplements that will unfailingly resuscitate all aspects of failing mitochondria, it has been reported that a number of nutrients, supplements and prescription substances may alleviate or restore many aspects of mitochondrial failure. Combinations of these, acting on multiple targets, may nor - malize and/or improve mitochondrial function, increase cel - lular and systemic energy production, alleviate mitochondri-al-related disease, and delay age-related decline in many organs and systems of the body. The rise in the incidence of cancer and deaths from can - cer not only parallels the rise in the development and use of toxic chemicals and materials in the environment, but also toxins in our food and water supplies and pharmaceuticals. The rise in cancer incidence and deaths is thought to be di - rectly caused by such toxic ingestion and the body's increas - ing inability to cope with the toxic overload of xenobiotics that profoundly affects the mitochondria. It is conceivable that combinations of various mitochondrial enhancers/resuscita - tors, acting on various portions of the mitochondrial energy production pathway will have complementary/additive effects and decrease the cancer incidence and death rates. Here we have proposed a combination of diet, exercise and supplements containing a mixture of nutrients men-tioned herein to significantly enhance mitochondrial function to help restore oxidative respiration to a level of favoring ma - lignant cell re-differentiation or to at least restore apoptotic mechanisms since the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in cells is regulated largely by functional mitochondria. When restoring mitochondrial function, we may reverse aerobic glycolysis, inhibit cancer cell growth and possibly, reverse malignancy. Scientific support for the use of vitamin-based and co - factor-based mitochondrial therapies is accumulating. This Mitochondrial Correction (Mitochondrial Rescue, Mitochon - drial repair) approach is intended to promote critical enzy - matic reactions, reduce putative sequelae of excess free radicals, and scavenge toxic metabolic molecules, which tend to accumulate in mitochondrial diseases. Some sup-plements also may act as alternative energy fuels or may bypass biochemical blocks within the respiratory chain. We believe this concept can have an important repercussion in the treatment of degenerative diseases. References Abidov, M., Crendal, F., Grachev, S., Seifulla, R., & Ziegen - fuss, T. (2003).
