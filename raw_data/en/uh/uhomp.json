Tel: \u00fe41-21-692-5600; Email: pascale.vonaesch@unil.ch Abstract The intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in health and changes in its composition are linked with major global human diseases. Fully understanding what shapes the human intestinal microbiota composition and knowing ways of modulatingthe composition are critical for promotion of life-course health, combating diseases, and reducing global health disparities.We aim to provide a foundation for understanding what shapes the human intestinal microbiota on an individual andglobal scale, and how interventions could utilize this information to promote life-course health and reduce global healthdisparities. We briefly review experiences within the rst 1,000 days of life and how long-term exposures to environmentalelements or geographic specic cultures have lasting impacts on the intestinal microbiota. We also discuss major publichealth threats linked to the intestinal microbiota, including antimicrobial resistance and disappearing microbial diversitydue to globalization. In order to promote global health, we argue that the interplay of the larger ecosystem with intestinalmicrobiota research should be utilized for future research and urge for global efforts to conserve microbial diversity. Key words: intestinal microbiota gut microbiome Introduction The microbiota generally includes a community of bacteria, archeae, fungi, protozoa, worms, and viruses that live inside and on the human body as well as all the genes that they jointly encode [ 1]. Playing a crucial role in our health over the life course [ 2], the microbiota is generally believed to be inherited at birth from the mother, maturing during the first months of life[3]. At around two or three years of age, the intestinal microbiota reaches an adult-like composition and complexity [ 3] and remains relatively unchanged until senescence, making the firstyears of life critical for optimal microbial colonization [ 4].In predicting life-course trajectories of health, deviations of bacterial communities from a healthy state (i.e. dysbiosis) of the infant intestinal microbiota have been associated with a varietyof morbidities [ 5] and several infectious and chronic diseases, including necrotizing enterocolitis, inflammatory bowel dis-eases, malnutrition, metabolic conditions (e.g. obesity), and atopic diseases including allergies and asthma [ 6]. Alpha diver- sity (i.e. number of distinct members) and beta diversity (i.e.variability of microbial communities) of gut microbial taxa mayalso play essential roles in child neurodevelopment growth [ 7].

In general, the bacterial species in the intestinal micro- biota is highly variable between individuals, but is generally dominated by Actinobacteria and Firmicutes [8,9]. However, the intestinal microbiota typically encompasses similar bacterial strains grouped by encoding function, suggesting that the hu- man microbiota is based on functional properties rather than a specific taxonomic assembly [ 10,11]. Understanding the complex assembly of an individual's gut microbial community is of great interest for immunology, mi- crobiology, and\u2014more recently\u2014public health interventions [12]. In fact, personalized medicine\u2014a novel and potentially groundbreaking field\u2014may target the intestinal microbiota as a therapeutic solution for various diseases, including some of the main public health concerns of modern times such as ischemic heart disease [ 13], stroke [ 14], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ 15], or cancer [ 16,17]. Our review provides an overview of individual, environmen- tal, and geographic factors that shape the human intestinal microbiota utilizing a global perspective. We also discuss the importance of the intestinal microbiota for life-course trajecto- ries and global health. Lastly, we review promising interven- tions that promote a healthy intestinal microbiota and global health. Microbiome development on an individual scale Effect of mode of delivery on future health In the immediate period following birth, the infant's immune system is undeveloped due to the near-sterile environment of the mother's womb [ 3,18-20]. The first stages of immune-sys- tem maturation and gut colonization are heavily shaped by the birthing process (i.e. mode of delivery). Exposure to vaginal and fecal microbial communities during natural childbirth is a criti- cal factor in \"seeding\" an infant's microbiota composition [ 4, 21]. Vaginal taxa from the mother have also been found to tran- siently colonize the child's fecal and airway microbiota [ 22]. Vaginal microbiota communities are typically dominated by Lactobacillus species [ 23,24], specifically L. iners ,L. crispatus ,L. gasseri ,o r L. jensenii ; yet, significant differences are seen be- tween North American women from different ethnic groups (White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian) [ 25]. When a misbalance in vaginal microbiota occurs, such as a lower abundance of Lactobacillus , bacterial vaginosis is likely to occur\u2014resulting in unwanted perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth (e.g. in- fant born at <37 weeks' gestation) [ 26]. Yet, women with a vagi- nal microbiome dominated by L. crispatus seem to have a lower risk of preterm birth [ 26,27]. Maternal fecal microbiota can also have profound effects on birth outcomes, including gestational age at birth, birthweight, and neonatal growth [ 28]. Infants born preterm are exposed to an undeveloped vaginal microbiota, as the vaginal microbiota only increases in its diver- sity after 36 weeks of gestation [ 29]. In fact, the maternal vaginal and fecal microbiota changes during pregnancy; therefore, if a child is born at an earlier stage of pregnancy, the child will not be exposed to a mature fecal or vaginal microbiota. In earlypregnancy, an initial increase in butyrate-producing strains in the feces was found among 91 pregnant women [ 30]. Later in pregnancy, there was a significant decrease in alpha diversity and an increase in beta diversity in the fecal microbiota\u2014whichwas accompanied by an increase in Enterobacteriaceae and Actinobacteria , and a decrease in Faecalibacterium [30,31]. In late pregnancy, the vaginal microbiota shifts towards a microbiome dominated by Lactobacillus and concomitantly a decrease in both alpha and beta diversity [ 32]. Even among infants born at term (i.e. end of pregnacy), a dysbiotic microbiota from the mother can be passed to her child [33]. In two small studies in Spain [ 34] (16 cases and 26 controls) and in the USA (77 subjects overall) [ 35 ], infants from obese mothers were found to inherit a dysbiotic microbiota. In moth-ers suffering from intestinal bowel disease, aberrant intestinal microbiota composition was found throughout pregnancy and their children presented with a changed seed microbiota, affect-ing immune markers when transferred to germ-free mice [ 36]. Recent evidence also links the maternal third-trimester micro- biota to child behavior in their offspring, emphasizing the im-portance of the inherited seed microbiota on the healthydevelopment of children [ 37]. Infants born by Cesarean section (C-section) have a disrup- tion to the mother-newborn transmission of microbiota, as they are not exposed to the vaginal and fecal microbiota at birthand only acquire a seed microbiota from the mother's skin andthe environment [ 3,38]. Mothers who undergo a C-section are often provided wih intrapartum antibiotics in order to prevent surgical infection [ 39], which has a deleterious effect on micro- biota [ 40]. As a result, infants born vaginally show higher levels ofBifidobacterium and lower levels of Enterococcus and Klebsiella than infants born by C-section; however, these differences ap-pear regardless of intrapartum antibiotic use [ 41]. A lack of ex- posure to these microbial communities may disrupt the normal infant intestinal microbiota development, resulting in an im- mune system that does not function properly and increases therisk of disease [ 42]. For example, higher levels of Bifidobacterium are consistently found in vaginal-born infants than infants born by C-section [ 43] and is important for host defense against pathogens [ 44]. Responding to the major lifelong implications for infant in- testinal microbiota development and life-course health among infants born by C-section, medical interventions are utilizing maternal vaginal microbes to artificially inoculate infants byswabbing an infant's face, nose, and ears with vaginal fluid [ 45]. However, a pilot study providing oral administration of vaginal microbes to children born by C-section in New Zealand callsinto question the importance of vaginal microbes for seeding[46]. There is also an ongoing debate on which maternal micro- biota, specifically vaginal or fecal, is more important for initial seeding of the child microbiota and whether transferring mater-nal vaginal or fecal microbiota to infants born by C-section can restore the disturbed seed microbiota [ 47]. Two recent studies demonstrated that strains from different maternal microbiotaare transmitted to the child; however, most of the maternalstrains found in the infant's intestinal microbiota come from the maternal intestinal microbiota\u2014which leads to a more sta- ble colonization than strains from other sources, such as thevaginal microbiota [ 33,48]. A recent pilot study corroborated this finding, showing that fecal microbiota transfer from the mother corrects disturbances in early-life microbiota amonginfants born by C-section [ 49]. Further, fecal microbiota of the infant is more similar to maternal fecal than vaginal microbiota [50]. All of the aforementioned studies were limited by partici- pation size; therefore, further research is needed to reproducethese scientific results and assess the potential use of micro- biota restoration interventions. Due to the global increase and2| J.T. Wallenborn and P. VonaeschDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gastro/article/doi/10.1093/gastro/goac010/6566221 by on 05 December 2022 trend of planned C-sections, identification of a microbiota resto- ration strategy is of the utmost importance for global health. Therefore, in terms of global health, a healthy maternal microbiota passed on to the child through a natural birth pro-cess sets the stage for a healthy seed microbiota in newborninfants and a positive effect of lifelong health. Influence of breastmilk bioactives and microbiota on the intestinal microbiota of the child and future health Historically, breast milk was considered sterile; however, accu- mulating evidence using culture-dependent and sequencingtechnologies shows the presence specific dominated Bifidobacteria [51-53]. is especially rich in human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), whichare a potent prebiotic for the developing infant's gut microbiota.Breast milk also contains a plethora of bioactive in-cluding cells, is recognized as the secondstep in the infant gut, with /C2425% of breastmilk micro- biota being transferred gut-associated anaerobes [ 51,57]. The specific microbiota and bioactive components in breast milk also influence the life-course trajectory of the infant's in-testinal microbiota community. Both breastmilk microbes andits bioactive substances play a direct role on the developing in- testinal microbiota, contributing to a decreased risk of asthma and allergy in later life [ 58]. Immune-modulating compounds found in breast milk also help reduce the likelihood of infec-tions [ 59]. Further, infant ingestion of breastmilk taxa as well as the prebiotic effects of breastmilk components may promoteimmune programming [ 54,58,60]. Thus, breast milk provides two critical components for infants: (i) a source of new bacterialspecies that shapes the intestinal microbial community assem-bly and (ii) specific HMOs and other bioactives that help create asustained colonization of the right strains in the developing fe-cal microbiota of the infant. Breastfeeding duration also heavily influences the intestinal microbiota. A meta-analysis of seven studies that included ex-clusive breastfeeding information and infant intestinal micro-biota found immediate and consistent differences in theintestinal microbiota between exclusively breastfed and non-exclusively breastfed infants\u2014persisting long after 6 months ofage [ 61]. The importance of exclusive breastfeeding crosses geo- graphic boundaries, as the seven studies were conducted acrossdifferent populations [ 61]. A large Canadian cohort reported that infant intestinal dysbiosis resulting from intrapartum anti-biotics was improved by exclusive breastfeeding and a longerbreastfeeding duration [ 40]. A higher microbial diversity was also reported in exclusively breastfed infants than in non-exclusive breastfed infants at 6 and 14 weeks postpartum; how-ever, a longer follow-up period is needed to ensure permanentand long-term benefits [ 62]. While still under investigation, breastfeeding\u2014either through breastmilk microbiota or the immunomodulatory andprebiotic substances\u2014plays a crucial role in the initiation andmaintenance of a healthy intestinal microbiota. Breast milkmay provide a viable strategy for promoting lifelong health byoptimizing or correcting gut microbial dysbiosis. One prime ex-ample is the difference between breastfeeding and formulafeeding in preterm infants.Preliminary evidence from an observational cohort study (n\u00bc69) suggests that human-donor breastmilk-fed preterm infants have gut that ers' own milk-fed preterm whereas formula-fed infantshad abundance [ 63]. Hence, it is pos- sible that providing donor human milk to infants not receiving breast milk could support gut microbial development and mod- ulate gut dysbiosis [ 62]. Overall, breast milk seems to be a major contributor to proper microbiota development and lifelong health. Effect of early-life antibiotics on future health In the last 70 years, most communities have seen a consistent increase in the use of antibiotics, often at a very early age. Antibiotics significantly disrupt the intestinal microbiota andhave long-term implications for life-course health. Antibioticuse has been shown to reduce the diversity of gut microbial communities and increases the likelihood of antibiotic- resistant organisms [ 64]. Disruption to the intestinal microbiota in early life by antibiotics may cause irreversible damage, as mi-crobial communities often fail to completely return to the pre- antibiotic state [ 65]. Destruction to the intestinal microbiota caused by early-life antibiotic use is likely the causal link be-tween antibiotic use and poor health outcomes [ 66]. Experimental research from mice receiving fecal microbiota transplant from antibiotic-exposed children showed reduced growth compared with mice receiving a transplant from chil-dren not exposed to antibiotics [ 67]. Research also consistently demonstrates an effect between early-life antibiotics and child growth in humans. Higher body mass indexes (BMIs) were found among boys and girls <6 years of age if they were exposed to antibiotics during the neonatalperiod [ 67]. A dose-response relationship was also found be- tween antibiotic use and childhood BMI z-score, showing a higher BMI with a higher number of exposures [ 68]. Further, boys had significantly smaller height and weight gains if ex-posed to antibiotics during the neonatal period; however, this association was not found among girls [ 67]. Interestingly, ma- ternal antibiotic use in pregnancy has also been associated withan increased risk of obesity and asthma in childhood [ 69-71]. Thus, antibiotics in early life pose a clear risk to a proper microbiota development and can affect lifelong health. They should thus be used very carefully, especially in the first1,000 days of life. Microbiome development on a global/community scale We briefly reviewed how different exposures [ 43] in the first 6 months postpartum, including mode of delivery [ 40,72-79], gestational age at birth [ 78], early-life breastfeeding or formula feeding [ 80], and the use of antibiotics [ 40], influence intestinal microbiota development. However, additional host and envi- ronmental factors later in life also shape the intestinal micro-biota. These include diet [ 81-83], systemic inflammation [ 84], disease, household and nutritional parameters [ 85], age, micro- nutrient deficiencies [ 86], general health status [ 87], medical prescriptions [ 88], genetics [ 89], and the immune system [ 87]. Environmental factors are hypothesized to have the biggest ef-fect on the intestinal microbiota [ 90]. Yet, many studies on the human microbiome are limited by low sample sizes. Technical differences in data generation also make an unbiased meta-analysis implausible. Further, it is difficult to disentangleMicrobiota and global health |3Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gastro/article/doi/10.1093/gastro/goac010/6566221 by Inactive user on 05 December 2022 vertical transmission of the microbiota due to passing of the microbiota and host genetics from mother to child. Diet is a main environmental factor that differs within and between geographic regions, creating individual and commu- nity-level differences in the human microbiota [ 81,82]. Short- term consumption of a diet composed entirely of animal-based or plant-based products showed that diet was able to shape the microbial profile more profoundly than inter-individual differ- ences with an increased presence of bile-tolerant microorgan- isms in the context of an animal-based diet and an increase in the level of polysaccharide-metabolizers in the plant-based diet [91]. Specific diets in Canadian Inuit tribes [ 92] and Hadza hunter-gatherers [ 93] from Tanzania clearly showed the influ- ence of diet on the overall microbiota composition of their feces.For the Hadza hunter-gatherers, seasonality [ 94] and the intro- duction of specific food items such as meat or honey are further hypothesized to directly change microbiota composition [ 95]. A meta-analysis of 27 dietary studies in human and rodents found consistent alterations of the intestinal microbiota in response to a high-fat diet and could identify a set of 228 operational tax- onomic units that are able to correctly classify subjects in thedietary groups (high vs low fat diet) [ 96]. Adaptation of the microbiota to specific host diets is persevered across several mammalian lineages, highlighting the important role diet has on community structure [ 97]. Diet also had a more pronounced effect on microbiota composition compared with genetic differ- ences in a study analysing dietary interventions in mice of dif- ferent genetic background [ 98]. Preparation of food also plays a role on available nutrients within food, impacting microbiota composition. A cooked or raw plant-based diet led to specific microbiota changes in mice. However, this effect may specifically impact plant-based diets. The difference in microbiota changes between cooked and raw food was more pronounced for plant-based diets than for meat-based diets. A potential causal pathway explaining these differ- ences is the digestibility and degradation of the starch as well as other plant-derived compounds [ 99]. Other diets composed of low carbohydrates but high-fat foods (i.e. ketogenic diet) af- fect microbiota changes and the immune landscape by decreas- ing the level of pro-inflammatory intestinal T H17 cells [ 100], showing a direct link between diet, the microbiome, and im-mune status. Lastly, recent research focusing on daily, longitu- dinal fecal sampling of 34 healthy individuals combined with detailed dietary records highlights that food choices have profound effects on the human microbiota; yet, it is individual- specific, as it strongly depends on the initial microbiota composition [ 101]. Urbanization has a major effect on microbial diversity and is interconnected with diet. In multiple countries around the world, an industrialized lifestyle was associated with a loss in microbial diversity compared with a more traditional lifestyle [ 94,102-105], which has important implications for global health, as it is hy- pothesized to be a major contributing factor for the increase in non-communicable disease in the industrialized world [ 106]. Specifically, members ,Treponema families of the Succinivibrionaceae ,Paraprevotellaceae ,a n d Spirochaetae have been shown to be diminished or to disappear in more industrialized contexts whereas Akkermansia muciniphila is more abundant [ 94,103-105]. Research also postulates that diet and geography as well as lifestyle choices dictate the presence of given strains within a given species, as recently exemplified by Prevotella copri [110].Studies in the USA have shown a rapid shift to an industrialized microbiota among recent immigrants and their descendants. Especially pronounced among this population is a rapid loss of taxa and encoded enzymes associated with plant-fiber degrada- tion that increases with time spent in the industrialized world [111]. Similar patterns in microbiota changes and associated non- communicable disease have also been shown in domesticated animals, where there is a mismatch between the current living situation and the long-evolved microbial communities of their microbiota [ 90]. These changes in taxa, especially in the abun- dance of Bifidobacterium longum and A. muciniphila , have recently been shown to have a causal effect in regulating cytokine re- sponse likely through histidine and arginine metabolism [ 112]. Additional factors shaping the microbiota across geography include the level of sanitation in a given location, which is di- rectly associated with exposure to pathogens. Increased expo- sure to pathogens affects microbiota composition through direct interaction and/or through inflammation [ 113]; inter- kingdom effects through non-bacterial species such as worms,protists, or fungi [ 114]; and exposure to drugs and antibiotics [88]. Global health disparities in infectious diseases [ 115], micro- nutrient deficiencies [ 116], caloric restriction [ 117], and under- nutrition [ 118,119] have all been shown to have a profound effect on the microbiome and thus on geographic differences in the microbiota profile observed. What is a \"healthy\" microbiota? A healthy microbiota is neither stable in time nor the same be- tween two individuals (reviewed in [ 120]). Coupled with the va- riety of factors that influence the microbiota, the definition of a healthy microbiota thus remains a challenge. Many of the influencing factors are tightly linked within the environment and each individual, making it challenging to disentangle spe- cific factors influencing the growth of given members of the mi- crobial community. In addition, the microbiota is a living entity, acquiring new microbial members as well as genetic elements through exchange of strains and genetic elements within thebroader context of the environment, animals, and other humans. This concept, known as One Health microbiota, depicts the sum of genes and strains shared between humans, animals, and the environment). The combination of the human body, their larger environment, and the microbiome form cre- ates a holobiont [ \"microbiota compositions\" can be considered \"healthy,\" depending on the larger ecosystem they are part of. Likewise, the composition in given microbial strains might be stochastic whereas the overall microbial functions and the met- abolic web they form seem to be more tightly linked to a general health state and more stable between individuals [ 10,11]. In addition to the complex interconnectedness between the microbiota and numerous factors, the widely used amplicon se- quencing approach is prone to false interpretation of healthy vs unhealthy community composition because of the strain-level differences in the microbiota. Lastly, the large geographic differ- ences in microbiota results in various healthy microbiota com- munities that have been evolutionarily adapted for those populations; therefore, a universal intervention may promote a healthy microbiota in some communities while negativelyimpacting another community microbiota. It is critical that the microbiota is considered part of a larger holobiont that we form as a human and as a small puzzle piece of ourselves, our dietary and lifestyle choices, and the larger environment we live in.4| J.T. Wallenborn and P. VonaeschDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gastro/article/doi/10.1093/gastro/goac010/6566221 by Inactive user on 05 December 2022 This calls for both in-depth studies and conservation of micro- biota for healthy and diseased individuals, and from geographi-cally, nutritionally, and culturally different settings. The role of the microbiota in the \"the world's biggest killers\" of global human disease The role of intestinal microbiota in life-course health becomes especially apparent when investigating \"the world's biggest kill-ers,\" which includes the top 10 global diseases that cause thehighest number of deaths. According to the World Health Organization, \"the world's biggest killers\" ordered from the most deaths to the least deaths include (i) ischemic heart dis-ease, (ii) stroke, (iii) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,(iv) lower respiratory infections, (v) neonatal conditions, (vi) tra-chea, bronchus, lung cancers, (vii) Alzheimer's disease andother dementias, (viii) diarrheal diseases, (ix) diabetes mellitus,and (x) kidney disease [ 122]. The majority of these diseases have been linked to dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota. We will provide examples of how the top three global killers are di- rectly linked with the intestinal microbiota. Coronary heart disease (i.e. ischemic heart disease), defined as a block to the heart blood supply, is responsible for the ma- jority of global deaths, accounting for 16% of deaths worldwide.In the past two decades, coronary heart disease has been the most rapidly progressing type of death, rising by >2 million. In 2019 alone, it accounted for 8.9 million deaths. In patients with coronary heart disease, the intestinal microbiota has a higheralpha diversity and different microbial composition than inhealthy individuals [ 13]. Several studies have noted that microbes used for the production of butyrate have lower abun- dances in the intestinal microbiota of patients with coronaryheart disease [ 123]. It was also found that in patients with coro- nary heart disease, Lactobacillales was significantly increased whereas the phylum Bacteroidetes was decreased [ 124]. However, the causal role of the intestinal microbiota in coronary heart disease has yet to be confirmed [ 125]. Stroke is the second common cause of death globally, ac- counting for 11% of all deaths worldwide [ 126]. Stroke occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow to the brain, which pre-vents oxygen transfer and results in the death of brain cells. Perturbations in the intestinal microbiota are also found in indi- viduals who have experienced a stroke compared with healthycontrols [ 14]. Immediately after a stroke, researchers have found a significant decrease in the groups Roseburia ,Bacteroides , and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii in the intestinal microbiota com- pared with healthy individuals [ 14].

Interactions between the intestinal microbiota and global healthMicrobiota and global health |5Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gastro/article/doi/10.1093/gastro/goac010/6566221 by Inactive user on 05 December 2022 in the intestinal microbiota and this was corroborated in mouse models [ 127]. Accounting for 6% of total deaths worldwide, chronic ob- structive pulmonary disease (COPD) has been shown to have distinct intestinal microbiota from healthy individuals. Compared with healthy individuals, the gut microbiome wasdominated by the Prevotella enterotype and also had lower levels of short-chain fatty acids among patients with COPD [ 15]. Another study reported 146 different bacterial species from patients with COPD compared with healthy subjects [ 128]. Pathogenesis of the disease has also been linked to differences in metabolites, specifically choline, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and arterial plaque forma- tion [ 129]. With technological advances and a reduction in laboratory-associated costs allowing larger and especially longi-tudinal studies, the causal relationship between the intestinal microbiota and global diseases will become more clear [ 130]. Geographic influence on gut microbial disease markers and outcomes In the previous sections, we have shown that the intestinal microbiota is heavily shaped by geography, industrialization, and diet, and specific diseases are associated with changes in bacterial communities. However, most studies to date focusing on disease-related microbiomes are performed in industrialized countries (i.e. Europe or North America), thus leaving the ques- tion of whether the observed changes are also relevant in a global context. We briefly explore this question in the subse- quent sections with two examples: (i) colorectal cancer (CRC)and (ii) childhood undernutrition. A recent meta-analysis investigated a global signature asso- ciated with CRC across eight geographically different regions in industrialized countries [ 131]. The authors found that 29 species are significantly and consistently higher among CRC patientsthan among healthy subjects. They also found enriched protein and mucin catabolism genes, depleted carbohydrate degrada- tion genes, and increased secondary bile-acid production in CRC patients. Similar results were obtained in an independent meta-analysis in populations of China, countries in Europe, and the USA [ 132], suggesting functionally and taxonomically con- served signatures for CRC, at least in industrialized countries with different dietary habits. In the last decade, extensive research has been conducted on childhood undernutrition, including chronic undernutrition (i.e. stunting) as well as acute undernutrition (i.e. wasting). In children with acute undernutrition, a decrease in overall bacte- rial richness and an increase in members of the Proteobacteria were found compared with healthy children. Further, there wasa consistent decrease in butyrate producers such as Roseburia , ,Butyrivibrio ,Lactobacillus , and Bifidobacterium (reviewed in [ 133]).Lastly, in severely undernourished infants, there seems to be a consistent delay in the bacterial succession observed in early life [ 134]. In stunted children, similar taxa are affected: there is a decrease in butyrate producers and strict anaerobes [ 121,135] and an increase in pathogens/pathobionts spp. and/or Campylobacter . However, inconsis- were found for alpha diversity [ 121,136]. For stunting, striking similarities in the composition of small-intestinal bac- teria were found in Bangladesh, the Central African Republic, and Madagascar, suggesting that the microbial composition has a direct and causal role in the disease [ 121,137]. Even though studies on wasting and stunting span several countries andcontinents, all of the included populations consumed starch- rich food. Therefore, additional data are needed to assess signa- tures in nutritionally distant populations, such as pastoralists or hunter-gatherer communities. While increasing evidence shows that specific microbial sig- natures are associated with global or region-specific disease, there remains a critical need for additional data to make defini- tive conclusions, especially in light of the technical bias found in current meta-analyses. We need larger studies assessing dys-biosis in a given disease that spans through several countries/ continents and dietary habits/industrialization levels. Further, we need validation studies in experimental set-ups (i.e. animalmodels) in order to infer a causal relationship between the ob- served microbiota changes and disease outcome. Microbiota from a One Health perspective in global health beyond the human dimension Sharing of bacterial strains and pathogens between humans, animals, and the broader environment Humans are part of a larger network comprising their direct en- vironment as well as the animals they interact with. One Healthis a concept that stresses the added value of jointly studying and addressing health problems in this interconnected space [138,139]. The One Health concept focuses on the emergence of novel pathogens, especially among zoonotic diseases that are transmitted from animals to humans (and vice versa) as well as environmental contaminants leading to human and animal dis- ease. With the recent increase in low-cost sequencing technol- ogy and capacity, integrative analyses that concurrently studythe sharing of pathogens and commensal strains have emerged. Exchanging and acquiring microbial strains within and between animals and humans depend on exposure to a given microbialcommunity or strain, retention of/colonization by given strains shaped through host or environmental factors, and establish- ment of the strain within the larger community through compe- tition and cooperation with the larger ecosystem (reviewed in [121]). Previous research showed that bacterial species are shared between the environment, animals, and humans. As an exam- ple, pig farms have a greater microbial diversity than suburbanhomes [ 140]. However, microbiota sharing also depends on host factors, exemplified by the higher similarities of strains shared between pig-farmers and pigs than cow-farmers and cows [ 141]; this sharing is mediated through indoor air [ 142], yet only tran- sient [ 143]. Also, it has been shown that family members share the microbiota with their pet dogs, suggesting a direct spreading from non-pathogenic strains between humans and animals that are in close contact [ 144]. While strains sharing between humans, animals, and the larger environment can be commensal, recent evidence sug- gests it may cause disease. Environmental enteropathy, achronic inflammatory disease that is linked to childhood under- nutrition, is directly linked to mouthing of soil that is contami- nated by chicken droppings [ 145,146], proximity to animals [147], and contaminated water [ 147]; thus, it is favoring the spread of enteric pathogens and either symptomatic or subclini- cal infections [ 148-152]. However, evidence also shows that chil- dren living in a farm environment experience less asthma and allergy risk compared with children growing up in an urbanizedenvironment (\"hygiene hypothesis\")\u2014a phenomenon that is likely mediated through early-life microbiota and changes in- duced to immune-system maturation is by Inactive user on 05 December 2022 evidence for the sharing of non-pathogenic microbial strains in a One Health context. However, research on the microbiome within a One Health context remains scarce. More studies are urgently needed utilizing a longitudinal design on integratedmicrobiota studies exploring the source, strains, direction, and magnitude of bacterial sharing. Microbiota as reservoirs for antimicrobial resistance A primordial example of One Health's relationship with themicrobiota is antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [ 156]. AMR is con- ferred by specific resistance genes that are carried by bacteria.AMR is currently one of the most pressing global health prob- lems; it is expected that multidrug resistant strains will indefi- nitely increase globally. Misuse and overuse of antibiotics inhumans and animals are believed to be the main drivers of the emergence of resistance [ 156]. AMR genes are found for as long as bacteria co-exist with each other. They have spread rapidlyafter the broad introduction of antibiotics in medicine and agronomy. New AMR strains can be generated through gene mutations and AMR genes can be transferred from environmen-tal strains to pathogenic/human-related strains through several mechanisms, including genetic recombination by horizontal gene transfer, conjugation, phage transduction, or transforma-tion [ 157]. The human intestinal microbiota is a hotspot for AMR gene exchange due to the densely populated bacteria that are in close proximity to each other. Inter-species and intra- species competition leads to higher mutation rates, favoring thespontaneous generation of new resistance mechanisms. Further, the high cell density provides ideal conditions for ex- change between transient and resident bacteria of the gastroin-testinal tract. Several other factors have also been shown to boost horizon- tal gene transfer between commensals and/or enteropathogens. For example, intestinal inflammation allows Enterobacteriaceae to lead to veritable \"blooms\" hence favoring gene transfer be-tween members of this family [ 158]. Artificial sweeteners have also been shown to increase conjugative plasmid transfer be- tween phylogenetically related and/or unrelated strainsthrough activation of the SOS response and increased cell mem- brane permeability in the bacteria exposed to non-nutritious ar- tificial sweeteners [ 159]. In line with these findings, horizontal gene transfer for intestinal bacteria was increased among peo- ple living in industrialized and urban communities compared with those living in less industrialized settings [ 160]. It remains to be proven if these factors thus also favor the occurence and spread of AMR genes. AMR is found not only in humans, but in any environment where different bacteria co-exist and compete for nutrients and other resources (including animals and the broader environ-ment). Antimicrobial carrying strains can be shared within this triangle, as can genetic material. As resistance is often con- ferred by mobile elements, resistance can pass between differ-ent compartments and different pathogenic and non- pathogenic strains. The widespread use of antibiotics in farm animals to increase growth results in alternative reservoirs thatcan harbor resistances that are then passed on to humans, po-tentially impacting pathogenic bacterial strains [ 161]. As surveillance tools for bacterial diseases, drug use, and AMR-car- rying strains in livestock is still poor and undeveloped, animalspresent a real danger to the emergence and spread of AMR. It is plausible that the global resistome found in human fecal samples is significantly impacted by antibiotics approved for animal use and by antibiotics used in human medicine [ 162].However, there is an ongoing debate on how much resistance is shared within a given habitat (i.e. from human to human) and how much is shared between habitats (i.e. human-animal, ani- mal-environment, or environment-human). A study in Peru showed that resistomes across different habitats are generally structured according to bacterial phylogeny and ecological gra-dients, yet there are given AMR genes that can cross these bar- riers [ 163]. This observation is in line with a previous study assessing >2,000 full bacterial genomes, which found that hori- zontal AMR and non-AMR gene transfer is mostly shaped by ecology [ 164]. A recent study assessing AMR transfer between farmers and their animals showed that microbial strains and AMR genes are shared more easily between farmers and pigs than farmers and other domestic animals [ 165]. Since the gas- trointestinal tract of pigs closely resembles the gut ecosystem of humans, it is plausible that the horizontal gene transfer and AMR exchange are most likely between strains sharing the same ecology. More detailed research is needed to assess AMR exchange in the lens of One Health in order to design the bestinterventions to combat this global threat. Nowadays, there is growing interconnectedness of the hu- man, animal, and environmental habitat, exaggerated throughglobalization, travel, and the increasing number of persons suf- fering from intestinal dysbiosis. AMR and especially AMR strains in the intestinal microbiome are thus of tremendous concern for public health and could well be the next emerging pandemic we are facing. Microbiota-targeted interventions are promising tools to improve global health As evidence of the importance of microbiota on health and dis- ease accumulates, there is increased interest in intervening in the microbiota and rehabilitating dysbiotic states. These so-called \"microbiota-targeted interventions/therapeutics\" com- probiotics health-promoting bacteria, often isolated from fermented food), prebiotics (i.e. fibers favoring the growth of health-promoting bacteria), synbiotics (i.e. combina- tions of probiotics in [ 166-168]). Fecal microbiota transfers (FMT) have also been used especially for refractory Clostridium difficile infections [ 169,170]. More recent interventions aim ei- ther replacing microbial-produced metabolites (postbiotics [ 171, 172]) or introducing specific foods modulate the microbiota [137,173,174]. Effectiveness of microbiota-targeted interven- tions is highly dependent on the starting microbiota of the re- cipient. Interventions using prebiotics require an initialpresence of the bacterial group in order for it to grow (permis- sive microbiota). Further, microbial responses to dietary fiber are highly individualized [ 174]. It is unclear why interventions are highly dependent on the baseline microbiota, yet strains ca- pable of enzymatically digesting given carbohydrates seem toplay a major role [ 175]. For FMT, the presence or absence of given bacterial species in the donor and pre-FMT recipient microbiota can hinder orpromote the succession of specific microbial groups leading from a disturbed microbial ecosystem back to a state of homeo- stasis. The first wave of bacteria including members of Desulfovibrio ,Odoribacter ,Oscillibacter , and Clostridioides genera seems to prepare the ecosystem through secretion of metabo-lites that helps reshape the overall ecosystem, while the second succession (including especially bacteria with bile-acid metabo- lizing activities) seems to lead to a restoration of \"lostMicrobiota and global health |7Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gastro/article/doi/10.1093/gastro/goac010/6566221 by Inactive user on 05 December 2022 functions\" [ 176]. This succession is thus favored when first- wave bacteria are present or hindered if they are absent. Microbiota-targeted interventions are rapidly gaining in pop- ularity. Current interventions aim to either (i) induce generalcommunity changes or punctual changes in health-promotingbacteria or (ii) lead to functional rather than taxonomic changes(Figure 2 ). In the following section, we will discuss different interven- tions and their potential to curb important public healththreats. Interventions leading to community changes Community changes can be completed by (i) replenishing miss-ing taxa by reintroducing complex com-munities of next-generation probiotics, (ii) introducing specificdietary components favoring the growth of given groups/gildsof bacteria, such as microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) [177], or (iii) use of specific diets that are empirically tested for promoting the growth of given bacterial groups/gilds [ 178]. Community changes can also be mediated through broad- spectrum antibiotics and drugs suppressing a large group ofbacteria (reviewed in [ 168]). A first trial using an empirically pre-tested microbiota-di- rected food intervention has shown promising results inchanging microbiota composition and ameliorating growth ofmoderately malnourished children in Bangladesh [ 137]. Clinical trials using MACs to ameliorate ill health are ongoing; however, preliminary data from mouse models indicate thatMACs could have an important role in shaping the microbiota,preventing infection [ 179], and improving the gut-brain axis in obese mice [ 180]. As food is easily accessible and transportable, microbiota-directed food interventions show a high potential for improving microbiota-related detrimental health effects on a global scale. Figure 2. Microbiota-targeted interventions8| J.T. Wallenborn and P. on 05 December 2022 Interventions leading to punctual changes Several other microbiota-targeted therapies provide punctual microbiota changes, such as pre-synbiotics and pro-synbiotics,phages, bacteriocins, and antibiotics and drugs. Probiotics are among the longest-used microbiota-targeted inter- ventions. More than 100 years ago, the French-Russian scientistElie Metchnikoff hypothesized that lactic acid bacteria were able to promote longevity and have beneficial health effects by replac- ing \"bad\" bacteria such as the toxin-producing Clostridium .D u r i n g the First World War, the German scientist Alfred Nissle further isolated an Escherichia coli strain from a soldier who did not de- velop enterocolitis in response to shigellosis ( E. coli strain Nissle 1917) and bacteria were used to treat gastrointestinal disease. The term \"probiotic\" was then coined in the 1960s by Lilly and Stillwell, who defined them as microbial-derived factors that stim- ulate the growth of other organisms. In the late 1980s, Roy Fulleremphasized that probiotics need to be viable and confer a positive effect on the host (reviewed in [ 181]). Today, most commonly used probiotic bacteria belong to the group of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium . Others include the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , some E. coli and Bacillus species, and less commonly used strains from other genera. Most ofthese initial probiotics were isolated from fermented food, espe- cially milk products. However, in the last year, there has been growing interest in next-generation probiotics\u2014a bacterial strain isolated from healthy humans. Due to the promising ben- efits for reducing the risk of metabolic disease, next-generationprobiotics include less commonly used species (i.e. A. mucini- phila ) of live or dead bacteria. Indeed, some of these next- generation probiotics specific proteins such as isolated extractof the protein [ disease [184]. Butyrate-producing bacteria are a new area of interest since they are less prevalent in industrialized countries and es- pecially in many patients with the most important public healththreats including undernutrition [ 185], ulcerative colitis [ 186], and type 2 diabetes [ 187]. Several other bacterial strains are cur- rently being explored as potential next-generation probiotics (reviewed in [ 188]). However, use of next-generation probiotics for general medical application is still a legal gray area. Several other means of regulating the microbiota have been used or are currently being developed. The term \"bacteriophages,\" introduced by Felix D'Herelle in 1917, designated a hypothetical vi-rus responsible for rapid bacterial death. Phages rapidly adopted as a means of treatment in the pre-antibiotic era have been exten- sively used in the Soviet medicine and have regained popularitydue to the rise of AMR (reviewed in [ 189]). While phages are tradi- tionally used to treat infectious diseases, their use as microbiota- modulating agents is increasingly discussed. Last, bacteriocins may also help grow specific members of the microbiota. Bacteriocins are antimicrobial peptides that hamper growth of competing strains and are produced by spe- cific strains of bacteria. In comparison to antibiotics, their mode of action rarely induces resistance. Further, different bacterio-cins exist with either narrow or broad-spectrum killing capaci- ties, making them attractive for biotechnological use (reviewed in [190]). More research on their mode of action as well as the spectrum of activity is needed in order to use them efficiently as microbiota-modulating drugs. Although punctual change interventions show great poten- tial for combating dysbiosis-related diseases in the future, their use is currently slowed down by safety issues, legal and regula-tory challenges in classifying, and medical approval [ 185].Interventions leading to functional changes Functional changes can be induced in the bacterial community either through dietary changes, specific metabolites that are ec-topically administered (i.e. postbiotics), or engineered probiotics expressing given metabolites (i.e. microbiome engineering). In previous years, microbiome engineering has been ham- pered due to limited availability of genetic tools to work with the gut microbiota. However, recent advances in the field of synthetic biology may help accelerate the development of strains and \"smart\" bacteria to help express given metabolites, thus helping to combat pathogens, diagnose early stages of can-cer, regulate mood, and reduce the prevalence of metabolism or gastrointestinal disorders [ 191]. With the CRISPR-Cas9 technol- ogy, formerly non-engineerable bacteria such as classical or next-generation probiotic strains [ 192,193] or whole microbial communities can now be genetically modified [ 194]. Combining the CRISPR-Cas9 methodology with phages allows single bacte- rial species to be genetically modified in a whole microbiome [185]. While several studies have highlighted the potential of engineered microbes, to our knowledge, no human trials have been conducted [ 195]. In recent years, modulating dysbiosis-associated pathophys- pathophysiological changes are in- duced not by the bacteria per se, but by the overproduction or lack of given metabolites. Examples include the short-chain acids acetate, butyrate, propionate, and lactate that are pro- duced by the human microbiota and have important signalingfunctions in the human host. Another example is tryptophan- derived metabolites (i.e. 3-indolepropionic acid), which are thought to limit intestinal inflammation by direct binding to the host receptor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (reviewed in [ 196]). Ectopic supplementation might provide the needed regulatoryfunctions; however, as there are no changes to the microbiota, these metabolites have to be constantly supplied from external sources to maintain a proper signaling function. Postbiotics are now used in clinical trials to treat a variety of dysbiotic diseases. Overall, microbiota-targeted interventions are promising tools to ameliorate and reverse dysbiosis-associated pathophys- iological changes. More research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and evaluate the safety of these treat- ments for large-scale human trials. Conserving the microbiota for future generations The concepts of \"missing microbes,\" VANISH and BloSSUM taxa The concept of so-called \"missing microbes\" [ 197,198] proposes the disappearance of bacterial species, which have co-evolvedwith us as a human host over millions of years (so-called \"indigenous microbes\"). The authors speculate that this is due to our industrialized lifestyle and that their disappearance is closely linked with the rise in post-modern diseases such as asthma and obesity. The underlying reasoning is that optimalhost-microbial interactions maximize the allocation and use of limited resources to benefit the host and its symbiotic microbial community. Thus, changes in the microbial ecology are having direct effects on human health, including height, weight, meta- bolic health, and immune development. This concept ofMicrobiota and global health |9Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/gastro/article/doi/10.1093/gastro/goac010/6566221 by Inactive user on 05 December 2022 \"missing microbes\" is in contrast with the earlier \"hygiene the- ory,\" which postulated a missing exposure to microbes throughexaggerated hygiene [ 199] rather than the disappearance of given microbial taxa. As there is a vertical transmission of the microbiota from a mother to her child, the authors postulatethat there is a step-wise decrease in particular bacterial species upon exposure to a more industrialized context, favoring the gradual increase in non-communicable diseases. Due to exag-gerated hygiene, there is also less horizontal transfer of micro-bial species, accentuating the microbial decrease and leading to a complete loss of given bacterial taxa. The concept of \"missing microbes\" has later been extended to the concept of \"industrialization\" or \"Westernization\" of the microbiome. Research has shown a step-wise decrease in alphadiversity (i.e. number of co-existing taxa) in the fecal microbiotafrom traditional hunter-gatherer communities compared with traditional but sedentary populations and industrialized coun- tries such as the USA or countries in Europe [ 106]. There seems to be a consistent loss of certain taxa, termed \"volatile or associ-ated negatively with industrialized societies of humans\" (VANISH) taxa. Concomitantly, we observed an increase in other taxa, termed \"bloom or selected in societies of urbanization/modernization\" (BloSSUM) taxa [ 200]. There is increasing evi- dence that this shift in bacterial taxa is directly associated with the rise in non-communicable diseases. Decrease in the VANISH taxa, including species from the families Prevotellaceae ,Spirochaetaceae , and Succinivibrionaceae ,i s primarily associated with a decrease in the consumption ofMACs in Westernized communities [ 177,201]. VANISH taxa are capable of degrading complex plant-derived carbohydrates as they encode different carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZyme),such as glycoside hydrolase. Research shows that this micro-biota transition is recapitulated by immigration of people from a country with a traditional lifestyle, such as Thailand, to a very industrialized country, such as the USA; however, this is aggra-vated over generations of living in the new host country [ 111]. Similarly, a recent experiment found that the microbiota of wild mice and domesticated mice started to resemble each other af- ter their diets were switched (e.g. wild mice eating a domesticmice diet); it reiterates the important role of diet in globalmicrobiome differences [ 90]. On the other hand, more of the BloSSUM taxa, including mem- bers of the Bacteroidaceae ,Enterobacteriaceae ,a n d Verrucomicrobiaceae families, were found in industrialized countries; these members are known to lead to low-grade inflammation and are favored by thehighly refined, high-fat, low-fiber diet consumed in many industri-alized countries [ 200]. Thus, a recent shift in the overall microbiota and especially a loss in health-promoting taxa seems to be associated with the rise in non-communicable diseases. Initiatives to conserve the world's human microbiota There is a rapid decline in microbial species in Westernized so-cieties compared with traditional communities [ 200]. Further, non-communicable diseases are on a constant rise inWesternized societies and are likely linked to the human micro- biota. This suggests that we are losing \"health-promoting\" bac- teria and that we should conserve these taxa before theybecome extinct [ 202]. Two global initiatives have started collecting and preserving the human microbiota around the world. The Global Microbiota Conservancy focuses on isolating and conserving bacterial strains from the human fecal microbiota. The Microbiota Vaultaims to conserve and characterize whole microbial communi- ties in an international storage facility similar to the GlobalSeed Vault [ 203,204]. While the two approaches differ in the samples they store (i.e. isolated strains vs whole microbial com-munities), the general idea, and the legal and ethical issues theyface are similar. Further, both initiatives give the property rightsof the collected strains to the local communities that providedthe samples. Besides storing microbiota for future generations, we also need to preserve our own microbiota by reducing exposure to factors that impair our microbiota. The global overuse of antibi-otics, consumption of processed food and food additives, a gen-eral loss of nutritional diversity, increases in infants born by C-section, low levels of breastfeeding, and exaggerated hygiene allhave their toll on the diversity of our microbiota [ 201]. However, this could be easily avoided. To not only maintain our microbialdiversity but also sustain public health on a global scale, weshould increase awareness on the important role our micro-biota has in maintaining proper health and well-being. In conclusion, the intestinal microbiota is at the cornerstone of human health and predicts the life-course trajectory forhumans. Influenced by individual, environmental, and geo-graphic factors, research on the intestinal microbiota should ap-proach scientific hypotheses utilizing knowledge of its interplaywith the larger ecosystem. Applying this approach will furtherour understanding on how perturbations of the intestinalmicrobiota impacts human health. In order to successfullychange the intestinal microbiota long-term, we must have abetter understanding of factors governing microbial composi-tion and conserve the microbial diversity for future generations.
