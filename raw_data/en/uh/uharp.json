Everyone around me had been doing the Detox and had good results. Caring family urged me to do it! This was obviously my first Detox and it kick started me to be very mindful of my eating habits and overall-health and wellness. I learned it's never too late and boy did I learn a lot! It was just what I needed, and I am extremely grateful. All you have to do is say Yes! If I can do the Detox, anyone can! Before the Detox I was feeling very sluggish, putting on more weight during Covid lockdown. I was achy, tired and experiencing lots of inflammation, swelling and overall feeling blah. My current bloodwork results were not going in a good direction and it caused some concern. On the detox I did have to really adjust what I ate, but I learned through the program with a lot of support and guidance to make those changes. I had HELP along the way from HHA and lots of team support and food ideas and recipes. I am happy to say I have made some life long changes and am soooo happy! I have dropped 15 pounds since starting the Detox and have continued those healthy foods in my everyday diet. I sleep better (no more snoring or wheezing) my mind is sharper and I feel empowered. As a result of doing the detox I learned what foods don't work well for me and it's really nice not to have inflammation and swelling! My hair is shinier, skin clearer and my nails started growing! It's like since the Detox everything in my body started working better! I go for bloodwork in 2 weeks and am excited to see the changes for the better. I am truly a work in progress! I am looking forward to the Spring Detox to reinforce and learn more! I cannot Thank-you guys enough for your caring, kind guidance, knowledge and support! 5 out of 5 C.
