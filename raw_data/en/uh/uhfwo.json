And the effectiveness? It's guaranteed. It's mean and it's greenEcoControl provides the guaranteed protection from pests you expect from Terminix Commercial, but utilizes environmentally considerate methods. It's a pest solution that reduces your footprint and effectively protects your business from pests. We're detrimental to pests, not to the environment We start with the premise that preventing pests is greener than simply reacting to them. That means we put an emphasis on proactive inspection and elimination of conducive conditions. Wherever possible, we replace synthetic chemical treatments with natural substances, like plant essential oils, and alternate methods, like trapping. We also incorporate our Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, including educating your employees to maintain those non-conducive conditions instead of relying solely on chemical treatments. Best of all, our EcoControl program meets the standards set forth by QualityPro Green and the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED\u00ae) program. How our Ecocontrol pest control works - We start by working to prevent pests versus reacting to them. We perform a proactive inspection and work to eliminate pest-conducive conditions. - We will utilize low-impact products and methods, including targeted insect baiting. - We may apply insect growth regulators for long-term control.We'll use natural substances, such as plant essential oils, and alternate methods, like vacuuming and trapping. - We will also partner with you and train your staff to help ensure that pests cannot enter the building. Our Business First\u00ae PromiseWe provide pest control but we stand for business.
