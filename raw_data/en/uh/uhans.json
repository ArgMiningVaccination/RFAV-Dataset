As a result, the Huffington Post's Senior Health Editor, Alana B. Elias Kornfeld, called Whelan to say that her health articles are vetted by a Medical Review Board. She said: \"This has been true since HuffPost Health launched in Fall 2010 as a vertical separate from HuffPost Living where wellness coverage appeared in the past. As such, the acupuncturist referenced in Mr. Parikh's 2009 Salon article is not the Health editor. Myself and Associate Health Editor, Meghan Neal, are both trained journalists.\" Today, the Huffington Post published [ this piece](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-kirby/autism-vaccine-_b_817879.html) by author David Kirby, entitled \"The Autism-Vaccine Debate: Why It Won't Go Away.\" In it, he argues that people are still convinced of a vaccine autism debate for a reason, and that \"science and the media,\" those monolithic institutions, should stop declaring the link debunked. Kirby writes: Why do so many educated, successful parents still believe that the current vaccine schedule can hurt a small percentage of susceptible kids, and that some of those injuries might result in an autism spectrum disorder (ASD)? Despite all of the population studies showing no link, high-profile court cases that went against parents, insistence of omniscience by health officials and the public mauling of Andrew Wakefield, I don't think that many people around here have changed their minds.That's because evidence of a vaccine-autism link did not come to them via a 12-year-old study published in a British medical journal, nor from Hollywood celebrities: Not very many had heard of Wakefield until recently. Over at Scientific American, Seth Mnookin [ably points out the problems](http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/post.cfm?id=the-huffington-post-and-the-ongoing-2011-02-11) with Kirby's argument, which uses the very reason the vaccine-autism connection can seem convincing even if it is not true -- signs of autism often occur during a period when kids also get lots of shots -- into a reason to believe the idea is true, despite data to the contrary. Mnookin writes: Again and again and again, Kirby has changed the \"proof\" he says is needed to demonstrate that vaccines are safe. In the epilogue to his book, Kirby quoted a parent saying that if the thimerosal theory was correct, autism rates should start to go down by 2005, which was four years after thimerosal had been removed from childhood vaccines. Then in 2005, he told Imus, \"It's going to take another two years before we know whether [thimerosal] has been causing the rise.\" In 2007, autism diagnoses were still going up; since then, he's advanced an array of new theories. In his piece today, Kirby says that \"the ranks of the devastated but convinced\" who believe vaccines are to blame for their children's autism will continue to grow because \"there is nothing that anyone can do or say \u2014 not you, not me, not any scientist on earth \u2014 until definitive proof of all the true causes of autism is found.\" That, of course, is completely nonsensical: We don't need to know what does cause each and every case of autism to feel confident saying that certain things are not the cause. (By that logic, the long-discredited \"refrigerator mother\" theory \u2014 that autism was the result of emotionally frigid mothers \u2014 would still be in play.) ... To state as fact that the children of these \"friends, family and business associates\" had \"an adverse vaccine reaction\" is irresponsible and untrue. What is true is that there are many parents who believe that their children had an adverse reaction. What is also true is that in many cases in which there is actual evidence \u2014 contemporaneous medical records, videotapes, etc. \u2014 as opposed to the anecdotes that Kirby is referring to, what parents remember occurring and what actually occurred are two different things. via [Guest Blog: The Huffington Post and the ongoing fear that vaccines might cause autism]. I would just add that there's no reason to believe that Kirby's solution -- changing the schedule on which shots are given -- would have any effect at all. Most likely it would result in fewer kids getting all their vaccinations, just because it's harder to make sure every child gets their shots if they are all on different schedules. Kirby is proposing a treatment that could cause harm without any evidence of benefit. I've asked Kornfeld for a response, and will post it here should she reply. Update: Here is Kornfeld's response: \"Kirby's piece doesn't say that there is an autism link for sure, but rather that the jury's still out. His opinion on the matter is clear: 'I know that many people will say the vaccine issue has been thoroughly investigated and debunked. I honestly wish that were the case, but it simply is not true.'\" Update two: Kornfeld confirms this piece went through Huffington Post's vetting process for medical articles. "}
