II.2 ACTIVE SUBSTANCE rINN: COVID -19 Vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted) Structure The active substance (company code NVX -CoV2373) is the protein product of a recombinant SARS -CoV -2 S-gene encoding the 1260 amino acid spike protein (the full length 1273 amino acid protein minus the signal peptide). The SARS -CoV -2 viral envelope consists of multimers of the spike (S) glycoprotein which mediate receptor binding and membrane fusion with the host cell. The S gene was codon optimised for expression in Spodoptera full -length, prefusion, stabilised SARS -CoV -2 S genetic sequence. A total of five amino acid changes were introduced, including thr ee in the S1/S2 furin cleavage site (RRAR to QQAQ) and HR1 domain where 2 proline substitutions (2P) were inserted at residues K986P and V987P, respectively. It is stated that these mutations were introduced to stabilise the protein. The virus s train name is Wuhan -Hu-1 and was collected from the Wuhan seafood market in December 2019. Purified recombinant spike (rS) glycoprotein forms trimers which bind with high affinity to the human angiotensin -converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The 13 amino acid signal peptide is not present on SARS -CoV -2 rS and thus the rS is 1260 amino acids. The SARS CoV -2 rS protein has 22 known glycosylation sites which results in a heterogenous glycoprotein with a theoretical molecular weight of 163,997 Da. COVID -19 V accine (recombinant, adjuvanted) is not the subject of a European Pharmacopoeia monograph.

Controls of critical steps and intermediates Critical process parameters (CPPs), in -process controls (IPCs) and critical quality attributes (CQAs) are defined. Appropriate in -process controls and intermediate specifications are applied. The controls (in -process bioburden and endotoxin m easurements) used to demonstrate microbial control of the manufacturing process for drug substance are described and found acceptable. Process validation and/or evaluation Process characterisation of active substance was performed in parallel with the PPQ campaign at SIIPL as part of a non -traditional approach to enable rapid deployment of a manufacturing process of commercial production, in response to the current global pa ndemic. The process validation campaign was performed with the equipment intended for the commercial active substance manufacturing process. Additional supportive studies were performed prior to or concurrent to the PPQ campaign to support process validati on. These comprised studies on stability of the Sf9 End of Production Cells, WVS hold time studies, buffer biochemical stability studies, process intermediate biochemical stability studies, resin lifetime and re -use studies, residual impurities (including for process -related impurities and residual DNA), viral clearance studies, extractables and leachable risk assessments and filter validation studies. Summaries of these studies are provided. Collectively, the PPQ data overall provides scientific evidence t hat each stage of the active substance manufacturing process, when executed according to the production batch records, consistently produces an active substance that meets its product specification. However, to further address the assurance of the impurity profile, the applicant has committed to explore possibilities to further optimise the manufacturing process with regard to removal of impurities. Manufacturing process development A summary of Novavax's manufacturing lots used in clinical studies is prov ided. Lots were manufactured in the US at Emergent BioSolutions, Inc (EBSI) and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies (FDBU). Lots manufactured and their respective use to date are described. Multiple changes were introduced during active substance process dev elopment. Several changes have been introduced which increased product purity. Extensive comparability testing results were provided and discussed in detail. In view of the complexity of the active substance, some variability between batches produced at th e different sites may be expected. It is noted that some of the differences are indeed intended (increased purity, different protein and PS80 content). The SIIPL commercial process lots are not considered fully comparable from a quality perspective for pot ency and binding kinetics when compared with the EBSI/FDBU materials used in the clinical studies. SIIPL active substance batches have higher purity when compared to active substance batches used in preparation of finished product batches applied in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies and hence comparability is not demonstrated for this quality attribute. However, these differences can be justified as they are not expected to have an adverse impact on safety or efficacy profiles. This is further supported by the results from clinical study 2019nCoV -101 (two -part phase 1/2 randomised observer blinded study designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NVX - CoV2373). Although higher frequencies of local and systemic reactogenicity occurred in participa nts receiving the higher antigen dose (25 g) compared to the lower antigen dose (5 PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 14 g), the safety profile was overall considered acceptable. The proposed upper limit for protein content is significantly lower than the 25 g/0.5 mL dose used in the phase 1/2 studies. The particle size distribution ranges overall are comparable . Characterisation Structural characteristics of the rS protein and particle characteristics have been investigated using a variety of orthogonal methods. The active substance part icles consist of rS trimers and PS80 micelles that form a complex. The ACE2 -receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein faces outward from a core of PS80 molecules with the rS C -terminal hydrophobic transmembrane region facing toward the micelle int erior. This arrangement of multiple rS trimers around a PS80 core is referred to as a rosette. Inter -trimer interactions between rS proteins were also observed resulting in higher order spike multimers. Product - related and process -related impurities have b een identified and characterised. Some residual host cell (Sf9) and baculovirus proteins were found to be present in the clinical and commercial batches. Overall, sufficient information on the characterisation of the molecule has been provided. A number of post-authorisation commitments have been agreed with the applicant (recommendations) to provide data to further substantiate this conclusion. Considering the purity levels of the batches used in clinical studies, and the purity levels of commercial proces s batches, the specification for purity of rS content is acceptable for the conditional marketing authorisation. Control of drug substance The active substance specifications include general tests (appearance, pH, PS -80), protein concentration, identity , purity, potency, residual DNA and safety tests (endotoxin, bioburden, mycoplasma/spiroplasma, harvest contamination). The manufacturer has provided adequate justification for these limits, based on efficacy and safety considerations. Validation of analyt ical procedure Validation of the analytical methods used for the control of the drug substance are satisfactory for ensuring compliance with the relevant specifications. Batch analyses Batch release results for all batches used in the clinical trials, along with site of manufacture, have been provided and show that all batches conformed to the specifications in force at time of manufacture. Batch analysis data of active substance batches manufactured as SIIPL have been provided. The results are within specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process. Reference standard The Reference Standard which is currently used for the potency assay is an intermediate reference standard. This standard was prepared from representative activ e substance and was calibrated against active substance used in the Phase 3 clinical studies. This provides a link between the reference standard and clinical study material. A protocol has been provided for the calibration of the new primary and working r eference standard. After calibration, the new primary reference standard will be bridged against the intermediate reference standard and previous Reference Standard. Container closure system The choice of container/closure is adequately described and just ified. Stability testing has shown the primary container to be compatible with the drug substance.

All excipients comply with either their respective European/national monographs , or a suitable in -house specification . Satisfactory Certificates of Analysis have been provided for all excipients. The finished product composition is described in Table 2 below: Table 2: Finished product composition The finished product is formulated on the basis of the total protein concentration of the active substance and a 5% overage is used to compensate for any potential loss during finished product manufacturing. The vials are filled with a minimum of 6.0 mL to ensure that 10 doses of 0.5 mL can be withdrawn. Novel excipient - adjuvant The Matrix -A and Matrix -C adjuvant components contain purified, chromatographic fractions (A and C) of enri ched purified bark extract from the tree Quillaja saponaria Molina (saponins) as well as cholesterol from botanical origin, and phosphatidylcholine, from hen's egg yolk. Matrix -A and Matrix -C are regularly shaped, uniform and stable complexes (nanoparticle s) suspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine are present as excipients in the Matrix formulation. Characterisation has been conducted with several orthogonal methods for chromatographic profile, identity, monosacchar ide analysis, haemolytic activity, particle size and structure. The impurities related to the manufacture of Matrix -A and C have been adequately discussed. The control specification comprises tests for appearance, identification, concentrations of saponin (SA), PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 16 cholesterol (CH) and phosphatidylcholine (PC), saponin purity, residual detergent N - Decanoyl -N-methylglucamine, pH, average particle size, ratio CH/SA, rati o PC/SA, bioburden and endotoxins. The specifications and shelf -life will be further reviewed post- approval based on updated characterisation and stability data. Based on batch release results, results of characterisation tests and the preliminary results of the comparative accelerated stability studies, it is concluded that clinical finished prod uct batches are sufficiently comparable to commercial finished product produced at SIIPL. This product does not contain or consist of genetically modified organisms (GMO). Manufacture of the product A description and flow -chart of the manufacturing method has been provided. The manufacturing process is described in sufficient detail, including the equipment and materials used, formulation calculations, critical and non -critical process parameters with operating ranges/set points and in -process controls. The process principall y involves the preparation of the formulation buffer and active substance, preparation of Matrix -M adjuvant by mixing Matrix -A and Matrix -C, preparation of the co -formulated final bulk, sterile filtration of the co -formulated bulk to the filling machine (i solator), filling into sterilised vials and finishing. All critical steps are adequately controlled. A number of in -process controls are proposed for the manufacturing process and these are considered satisfactory. The PPQ studies confirm that the commerci al process performs effectively and is able to produce a finished product meeting its predetermined controls and acceptance criteria. Finished product specification The finished product specifications include general tests (appearance, pH, osmolality), protein concentration, identity , potency, content of Matri x-A and -C, safety tests (endotoxin, bioburden), extractable volume and container closure integrity (CCIT). The test methods have been described and adequately validated. Batch data have been provid ed that comply with the release specifications. Independent batch testing Independent batch testing is required for vaccines and provides additional assurance of quality before a batch is made available to the market. Independent batch testing is a function that is undertaken by an Official Medicines Control Laboratory (OMCL). T he UKs National Institute for Biological Standards and Control (NIBSC) is responsible for this function. Independent batch testing is product -specific and highly technical: it requires specific materials and documentation from the manufacturer and compris es laboratory -based testing and review of the manufacturer's test data. If all tests meet the product specifications a certificate of compliance is issued by the OMCL. Characterisation of impurities There are no new process related drug product impuriti es in addition to those described for the drug substance. Container closure system The container closure system has been well described and complies with the relevant quality standards of the Ph. Eur. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 17 Stability Finished product stability studies includ e batches of the finished product stored in the packaging proposed for marketing . A shelf -life of 9 months at 2 -8 \u00b0C is accepted based on the supporting data. However, the applicant is required to provide monthly updates for the PPQ lots manufactured at S IIPL using the specified manufacturing process and three PPQ lots manufactured at SIIPL using the commercial scale manufacturing process. This data is required to achieve a comprehensive data package and ensure consistent product quality during shelf -life and is therefore requested as a Specific Obligation . Suitable post approval stability commitments have been provided to continue stability testing on batches of finished product. Based on the stability information currently available, a shelf -life of 9 months can be accepted, with the following storage conditions: Store in a refrigerator (2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C). Do not freeze. Keep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light. Shelf-life Unopened vial 9 months at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C, protected from light. Unopened Nuvaxovid vaccine has been shown to be stable up to 12 hours at 25\u00b0C. Storage at 25\u00b0C is not the recommended storage or shipping condition but may guide decisions for use in case of temporary temperature excursions during the 9 -month storage at 2\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C. Punctured vial Chemical and physical in -use stability has been demonstrated for 6 hours at 2\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C from the time of first needle puncture to administration. From a microbiological point of view, after first opening (first needle puncture), the vaccine should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in -use storage times and conditions are the responsib ility of the user.

III NON -CLINICAL ASPECTS III.1 Introduction The following non -clinical studies were submitted with this application: Table 3: Summary of nonclinical pharmacology studies evaluating SARS -CoV -2 rS with Matrix -M adjuvant * * (also described as Matrix -M1 in study documents) Study Animals (n) Study design (treatment groups/ administration/endpoints ) Key conclusion Immunogenicity of various SARS - CoV -2 vaccine candidates (complete) BALB/c mice (n = 4 - 8/group) 1 and 10 g SARS -CoV -2 3Q BV2365 \u00b1 5 g Matrix -M1 1 and 10 SARS -CoV -2 3Q -FP806 - 815 BV2369 \u00b1 5 g Matrix -M1 1 and 10 g Scripps RBD \u00b1 5 g Matrix -M1 Placebo Administered IM on Days 0 and 14 Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG and hACE2 binding inhibition) on Days -1 (pre -dose), 13, 21, and 28 The full -length S protein construct bearing the 3Q substitution (BV2365) was modestly immunogenic in the absence of adjuvant but was highly immunogenic with the addition of Matrix -M1 adjuvant and induced functional antibodies. The BV2369 construct with the 3Q - FP806 -815 substitutions and deletions in the hydrophobic fusion peptide was immunogenic by the anti - S IgG mea sure; however, hACE2 binding inhibiting functional antibodies were not detected. For the RBD construct, anti -S IgG and hACE2 binding inhibiting titres were at the assay limit of detection for the 1 g dose and very low levels were detected on Day 28 at the 10 g dose. Cellular and humoral immune responses (complete) BALB/c mice (n = 3 - 6/group) 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS \u00b1 5 g Matrix - M1 Placebo Administered IM on Days 0 and 21 Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG, hACE2 binding inhibition) on Days -1 (pre -dose), and 28 CMI evaluations to assess Th1/Th2 response (ELISpot, flow cytometry) on Day 28 (spleen) High titre, functional immune responses (i .e, anti -S IgG antibodies, hACE2 binding inhibiting antibodies, and anti gen-specific T -cell responses) were observed; the addition of Matrix - M1 adjuvant provided higher immune responses compared with antigen alone. SARS -CoV -2 rS induced high levels of Th1 -type CD4+ T -cell responses to SARS -CoV -2 protein, which included po lyfunctional effector phenotypes. -M1 adjuvant -associated enhancement of and GC B - cell populations suggests favourable conditions for establishment of a diverse, high -affinity, and durable antibody response. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 19 Cellular and humoral immune responses (complete) BALB/c mice (n = 10/group) 1 or 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS unadjuvanted 1 or 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 5 g Matrix -M1 1 or 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 200 g aluminum hydroxide Administered IM on Days 0 and 21 Immunogenicity evaluations (hACE2 binding inhibition) on Days 20 and 35 CMI and Th1/Th2 evaluations: ELISA for IgG1/2a on Days 20 and 35 (serum); cytokine fluorospot on Day 35 (spleen and draining lymph nodes) Immune response induced by Matrix - M1-adjuvanted SARS -CoV -2 rS vaccine was balanced in its Th1/Th2 cellular immune response, with a supportive IgG1/IgG2a ratio; whereas Alum -adjuvanted SARS -CoV -2 rS vaccine primarily induced a Th2 - skewed humoral and cellular immune response. Cellular and humoral immune responses (ongoing; data through 6 months provided) Olive baboons (n = 2 - 3/group) 25 g SARS -CoV -2 rS unadjuvanted 1, 5, or 25 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 50 g Matrix -M1 Administered IM on Days 0 and 21 Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG, hACE2 binding inhibit ion, neutralization) on Days 0 (pre -dose), 21, 28, 35, 49, 120, and 182 CMI evaluations to assess Th1/Th2 response (flow cytometry, ELISpot) using PBMCs on Days 28, 49, and 182 SARS -CoV -2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant was strongly immunogenic in baboons, most notably at the 5 and 25 g doses. Matrix -M1 adjuvant provided antigen -sparing and enabled the induction of strong functional antibody responses compared with the unadjuvanted group. Strong antigen -specific, Th1 -skewed CD4+ Tcell responses were observed in all animals immunized with SARS - CoV -2 rS in the presence of Matrix - M1 adjuvant. Long -term evaluation of the immune responses showed that SARS -CoV -2 rS specific antibody and cell -mediated responses were measurable in baboons for at least six months post vaccination. Notably, Th1 (IFN -) cytokine producing cells were detected indicating the maintenance of antigen - specific T -cell population. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy challenge study to evaluate SARS -CoV -2 vaccine candidates (complete) Balb/c mice (n = 4 - 8/group) 1 and 10 g SARS -CoV -2 3Q BV2365 \u00b1 5 g Matrix -M1 1 and 10 SARS -CoV -2 3Q -FP806 - 815 BV2369 \u00b1 5 g Matrix -M1 1 and 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS (BV2373) \u00b1 5 g Matrix - M1 Placebo Administered IM on Days 0 and 14 Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG, hACE2 binding inhibition, neutralization) on Days -1 (pre -dose), 13, 21, 28, and 42 Challenge (selected groups) on Day 69 with necropsy on Day 73 Immunization wi th all three constructs resulted in anti-S IgG titres that were enhanced by the addition of Matrix - M1 adjuvant; however, only BV2365 and BV2373 elicited functional antibodies. Administration with 10 g of unadjuvanted BV2365 or BV2373 resulted in reduced lung viral load after SARS -CoV -2 live virus challenge, while the addition of Matrix -M1 adjuvant resulted in undetectable viral levels in lungs after challenge. This study demonstrated that the BV2365 (3Q) and BV2373 (3Q -2P) constructs were simila rly immunogenic and protective in mice, supporting the continued development of the more stable 3Q-2P BV2373 construct. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy challenge study to evaluate SARS CoV -2 rS (complete) Balb/c mice (n = 10/group) 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS unadjuvanted 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 g SARS -CoV-2 rS + 5 g Matrix -M1 Placebo Administered IM on Day 0 and 14 (or Day 1 4 only) Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG, hACE2 binding inhibition, neutralization) on Days -1 (pre -dose), 13, 21, and 28 Challenge on Day 56 with necropsy (histopathology) on Days 60 or 63 SARS -CoV -2 rS adjuvanted with Matrix -M1 elicited high levels of anti - S IgG titres and functional antibodies, which were significantly enhanced by Matrix -M1 adjuvant and dependent on antigen dose and regimen; doses of 1 and 10 g SARS -CoV -2 with Matrix - M1 adjuvant administered in the two - dose regimen induced the bes t immune responses. SARS -CoV -2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant provided protection against SARS -CoV -2 challenge in a dose -PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 20 dependent manner as evidenced by reduction in weight loss and viral titres. Low, suboptimal doses of SARS - CoV -2 rS vaccine did not show evidence of vaccine enhanced disease in challenged mice. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy challenge study to evaluate SARS -CoV -2 rS (complete) Golden Syrian hamster (n = 8/group) 1 and 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 15 g Matrix -M1 Placebo Administered IM on Days 0 and 14 (or Day 0 only) Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG, hACE2 binding inhibition, neutralizing) on Days -1 (pre -dose), 14, 21, and 29 Challenge on Day 35 with necropsy (histopathology) on Days 39 or 49/50 Immunization with one dose of 10 g SARS -CoV - 2 rS with 15 g Matrix - M1 or two doses of 1 g or 10 g SARS -CoV -2 rS with 15 g Matrix - M1 resulted in robust immune responses that were enhanced with the higher antigen dose and with a second vaccination. All SARS -CoV -2 rS vaccination doses and regimens evaluated resulted in protection from body weight loss, changes in activity level, viral replication, and lung pathology after SARS -CoV - 2 live virus challenge compared with placebo; there was no evidence of vaccine -enhanced disease following exposure to SARS -CoV-2. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy challenge study to evaluate SARS -CoV -2 rS (complete) Cynomolgus macaque (n = 4/group) 2.5 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 25 g Matrix -M1 5 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 25 or 50 g Matrix -M1 25 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 50 g Matrix - M1 Placebo Adm inistered IM on Days 0 and 21 (or Day 0 only) Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG, hACE2 binding inhibition, neutralizing) on Days 0 (pre -dose), 21, and 33 Challenge on Day 35 with necropsy (histopathology) on Day 42 Strong anti -S IgG titres , as well as functional antibody responses, were observed across all dose levels. The responses observed with the human dose of 5 g SARS -CoV -2 rS adjuvanted with 50 g Matrix -M1 were comparable to those observed with the higher antigen dose level (25 g). The 2.5 g SARS -CoV -2 rS adjuvanted with 25 g Matrix -M1 yielded strong antibody and functional immune responses that were approximately 2 - to 3-fold lower when compared to full human doses. All vaccinated animals, including those administered with low antig en/adjuvant doses and single -dose regimens, were protected against SARS -CoV -2 live virus as evidenced by the absence of sgRNA, an assay that measures newly replicating virus, in BAL and nasal swabs. SARS -CoV -2 rS was well tolerated and safe from any obvi ous vaccine - induced disease exacerbation response following exposure to SARS -CoV-2. Immunogenicity and protective efficacy challenge study to evaluate SARS CoV -2 rS (complete) Rhesus macaque (n = 2 5/group) 5 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 50 g Matrix - M1 25 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 50 g Matrix - M1 Placebo Administered IM on Days 0 and 21 (or Day 0 only) Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S IgG, hACE2 binding inhibition, neutralizing) on Days 0 (pre -dose), 21, and 31/32 Challenge on Day 38 with necropsy (histopathology) on Day 45/46 Immunization with one dose of 5 or 25 g SARSCoV - 2 rS with 50 g Matrix - M1 adjuvant resulted in robust antibody responses that increased with a second vaccination; comparable immune responses were generated across the antigen dose range evaluated. Compared with placebo, immunization with one dose of SARS - CoV -2 rS resulted in partial protection against viral replication in upper and lower airways, and immunization with two doses of SARS -CoV -2 rS resulted in near total protection against viral replication in upper and lower airways. Clinical observations, radiographic analysis, and histopathological PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 21 analysis did not identify clear differences between immunized and placebo animals; no evidence of vaccine -enhanced disease was observed. Long -term immunogenicity and protective efficacy (ongoing; data through Day 57 provided) Rhesus macaque (n = 6/group) 5 g SARS -CoV -2 rS + 50 g Matrix - M1 Administered IM on Days 0 and 28 Immunogenicity evaluations (anti -S and anti-RBD IgG) on D ays -7, 14, 28, 32, 42, and 57 CMI and Th1/Th2 evaluations: immunophenotyping and ICCS by flow cytometry; ELISpot Additional samples to be collected for evaluation through Day 365 with challenge planned on Day 365 Immunization elicited high levels of S- specific and RBD -specific antibodies and immune cells that were further increased by the second immunization. Changes in circulating immune cell abundance post -vaccination were consistent with typical responses to a potent adjuvant, as well as recruitment of lymphocytes to lymphoid organs. B-cell responses post -boost were consistent with a rapid recall of memory B cells.

Effects on clinical pathology parameters (fibrinogen, CRP, and/or globulin), which resolved during the recovery interval, and histopathology (subacute inflammation at injection sites and adjacent tissue), which were decreased at the re covery interval, were consistent with immune stimulation following administration of a vaccine. Anti-S IgG results confirmed vaccine delivery and demonstrated 100% seroconversion.

In the uterine cohort, there was no difference between fetal body weights, survival, or external, visceral, or skeletal exams. In the developmental cohort, there were no differences in number of male and female pups, pup body weights, survival, li tter size and sex, developmental markers, or gross pathology findings. SARS -CoV -2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant elicited robust anti -S IgG titres with a 100% seroconversion rate. Maternal anti -S IgG antibodies were detected in both fetal and pup samples confirming transfer of antibodies during gestational and postnatal stages of development; albeit pups exhibited significantly higher levels of maternal antibodies than fetuses. Abbreviations: anti -S 2 recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine. III.2 Pharmacology Data on immunogenicity and protection from challenge with SARS CoV -2 virus was presented from studies in mice, in hamsters and in monkey s. These studies were performed in order to characterise the humoral and cellular responses to vaccination and to also demonstrate the additio nal effect of the adjuvant, Matrix M1 . PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 23 In these species, vaccination resulted in IgG responses to the spike protein of SARS CoV -2 virus which resulted in blockade of engagement of virus with human ACE2. These IgG responses were boosted by the adjuvant. The adjuvant has been shown to be necessary for optimal immunogenicity and its mode of action has been demonstrated to a sufficient degree . CD4+ T cell responses were biased towards a Th1 response, eliciting IFN - and IL -2 compared to IL -4. Circulating Tfh cells were also observed after boosting, suggesting ongoing germinal centre reactions. Vaccination protected all species from adverse effe cts in the respiratory system after SARS CoV -2 challenge. One dose of unadjuvanted vaccine had limited immunogenicity, two doses, 21 days apart, was notably more immunogenic, with additional immunogenicity demonstrated with addition of the adjuvant. The principle that two doses of adjuvanted vaccine given some time apart was established by these data. After vaccination, there was no indication that SARS -CoV -2 live virus challenge resulted in worsening of the inflammatory response, or of a worse in -life course of disease ( e.g. body weight, general activity). Similarly, viral loads in lungs and lung histopathology were all indicative of only a reduction in disease. Cellular immune responses induced by SARS CoV - 2 rS with Matrix -M1 adjuvant were generally Th1-dominant. Thus, no risk of vaccine - associated enhanced respiratory disease was seen across all these studies. To summarise, vaccination produced antibodies to the SARS -CoV -2 S protein which act to block the engagement of the virus with ACE 2 so preventing infection of cells, resulting in reduced viral loads with reduced pathology, on encountering the virus. Sufficient data was presented to support clinical use of the vaccine with its adjuvant. III.3 Pharmaco kinetics No new pharmacokinetic data were provided and none were required for this application. III.4 Toxicology The general toxicities were studied in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice in rabbits given the intended human dose. Rabbits were dosed with SARS -CoV -2 rS on 4 occasions which is ample to support an initial clinical posology of two doses of the vaccine (5 g per dose in humans) with Matrix -M1 adjuvant (50 g per dose), 21 days apart. The same route, intramuscular, as is intended in humans was used in rabbits. Male and female animals were used. SARS -CoV -2 rS vaccine with or without Matrix -M1 adjuvant w as shown to be immunogenic in all rabbits tested, supporting this choice of species for toxicological evaluation. In the toxicity study, there were transient acute phase reactions, but no toxicity was identified that would be a concern for human use. There were local immunoinflammatory reactions at injection sites. There were also findings of reversible enlargement of the lymph nodes draining the injection sites which are attributed to an expected response to a vaccine and not to reflect toxicity. Rabb its tolerated a dose of 50 g of antigen, compared to a proposed clinical dose of 5 g. The adjuvant dose is the same between rabbit and human (50 g); other toxicity studies used double this dose without eliciting notable toxicity. These data are suffic ient to support a conclusion that the vaccine does not affect male fertility in rabbits: no effects indicating such were seen in the reproductive organs. Local tolerance was assessed in the general toxicity studies and separate evaluations are not needed. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 24 Genotoxicity studies were not done with the vaccine: these were done with the Matrix -1 M1 adjuvant. N o specific concerns was identified in studies in compliance with GLP. Carcinogenicity studies are not needed given the short exposure to the product. Data from a developmental and reproductive toxicity study in compliance with GLP in pregnant rats has shown no adverse findings . Rats were confirmed as showing an immune response to SARS -CoV -2 rS adjuvanted with Matrix -M1. The vaccine in intended for use in adults aged 18 and over. No juvenile animal studies are needed, including as there is no cause for such based on the general t oxicity studies presented. In summary, the vaccine induced local injection site reactions with transient systemic inflammation, all considered well tolerated and transient. The conclusion to date is that the data are adequate to support the clinical use of this vaccine. III.5 Ecotoxicity/Environmental Risk Assessment In accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447100), due to their nature vaccines and lipids are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Therefore, environmental risk assessment studies are not provided in this application for Marketing Authorisation, which is considered acceptable. III.6 Discussion on the non -clinical aspects These data support the claim that the vaccine is active to protect against exposure to SARS CoV -2 virus and there is no safety concern identified concerning human use, based on the toxicity studies presented. The grant of a marketing authorisation is reco mmended.

IV. 2 Pharmacokinetics No pharmacokinetic data have been submitted for this application and none were required. IV.3 Clinical immunogenicity The immunogenicity data available so far were generated from study 2019nCoV -101 part 1 and 2 (dose finding assessed primarily b ased on circulating neutralising and spike antigen binding antibodies. A limited amount of T cell immunity data was also included in the interim report of Study 2019nCoV -101. Bioanalytical assays The qualification or validation reports for each bioanalyt ical assay have been provided. Overall, the methods were considered acceptable and fit for purpose. Dose finding study 2019nCoV -101 Study 2019nCoV -101 is a two -part Phase I/II randomised, observer blinded, placebo - controlled study, designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of NVX -CoV2373 . Part one is the first -in-human trial evaluating the safety and immunogenicity of SARSCoV2 rS with or without Matrix -M adjuvant in healthy adult subjects 18 to 59 years of age at 2 sites in Australia. Part two commenced after positive results were observed following a formal analysis of the primary endpoints in Part one of the study and was des igned to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of SARS -CoV -2 rS with Matrix -M adjuvant in healthy adult subjects 18 to 84 years of age at two sites in Australia. Both Part one and two evaluated two dose levels of SARS -CoV -2 rS (5 \u00b5g and 25 \u00b5g), which were based on the results of non -clinical studies with SARS -CoV -2 rS and on the results of clinical studies with other Novavax based nanoparticle vaccines. Both parts also evaluated a single dose level of Matrix -M adjuvant (50 \u00b5g), based on previous clinical experience with Matrix -M adjuvant. Part 1 Subjects in Part 1 received either 1 or 2 doses of either 5 or 25 g rS with or without 50 g Matrix -M1 adjuvant . PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 27 Table 6: Trial design for study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 1) The adjuvant has a dramatic boosting effect on the antibody IgG response, which it increases by a factor 10 after a first dose and 100 at the peak of the response, 2 weeks after a second dose. It also shows a significant antigen dose sparing effect since there is no notable differenc e in the response to 5 and 25g of antigen after 2 doses, hence justifying the pursuit of the development with the lower dose. A strong correlation is observed between IgG and neutralising antibodies determined with a live virus assay. The second dose of vaccine increases the IgG and neutralising antibody response by a factor of around 20, which appears necessary to achieve a magnitude that is within the range of a control panel of human convalescent serum from symptomatic and hospitalised COVID -19 patient s. After the peak, IgG levels tend to decrease slowly up to 6 months, but more rapidly so for neutralising antibodies; nevertheless, the GMTs of neutralising antibodies at 6 months are still above 100 with seroconversion rates (SCRs) around 70%. Figure 2: Part 1 - GMT* (95% CI) for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 28 Figure 3: Part 1 - Reverse Cumulative Distribution Function of Neutralising Antibodies (PP Analysis Set) Part 2 Part 2 of the study was conducted in healthy males or non -pregnant females 18 to 84 years of age, inclusive, to further identify the optimal dose across age strata based on immune response at Day 35 and whether baseline immune status has an impact. The following treatment groups were included: Table 7: Trial design for study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 2) PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 29 Overall, the interim results from the larger study population in part 2 support the findings in Part 1 and provide further support for the inclusion of the adjuvant and administration of a second dose, with again no apparent advantage for 25 vs. 5 g antigen doses in the adjuvanted formulations. Of the 1,198 participants in the PP-Immunogenicity Analysis set, 30 (2.5%) were seropositive at baseline. IgG levels for the two -dose regimens in seropositive participants were more than double those reported for all participants regardless of baseline serostatus. The antibody response i n the 60-year olds is about half th at in younger adults, but the seroconversion rate after 2 doses is > 96% regardless of age. A similar pattern is seen with the neutralising antibody responses. Cellular response (Part 1 and 2) Consistent with the anti body response, adjuvant is crucial for induction of an antigen specific T cell response and a second dose of vaccine is needed to achieve a robust response. Elispot and Intracellular cytokine staining assays show an increase from in Th1 cytokine - producing T cells (IFN, TNF, IL -2) as well as Th2 cytokine -producing T cells (IL -5, IL - 13). Overall, a mixed Th1/Th2 profile is observed, which can be considered skewed toward a Th1 response. Main studies 2019nCoV -301, 302 and 501 The clinical phase 3 d ata confirm that the vaccine produces a robust immune response , and the studied two dose schedule resulted in seroconversion in almost all participants. As expected, immune responses were somewhat lower in adults 65 years of age compared with younger adu lts. In subjects that were seropositive at baseline , the 2 -dose regimen resulted in a markedly increased humoral immune response. An exploratory authorised seasonal influenza co -administration substudy was conducted as part of study 302 in the first approximately 400 participants who met the additional inclusion criteria for this study (i.e., participant had not received a current season influenza vaccine, had no contraindication to the specific vaccine to be administered in the study, a nd had no prior history of allergy or severe reaction to seasonal influenza vaccines). Licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were co -administered to participants on the same day as Dose 1 of NVX -CoV2373 (n = 217) or placebo (n = 214) in the oppo site deltoid muscle of the arm. An unadjuvanted quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Flucelvax, Seqirus) was given to those 18 to 64 years of age, and an adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluad, Seqirus) was given to those 65 years of age, in compliance with UK recommendations. Co-administration resulted in no change to influenza vaccine immune responses as measured by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) assay. A 30% reduction in antibody responses to NVX - CoV2373 was noted as assessed by an anti -spike Ig G assay with seroconversion rates similar to participants who did not receive concomitant influenza vaccine. SARS -CoV -2 neutralising antibody responses for the influenza substudy participants were not investigated by the applicant. Whilst a few cases of PC R-confirmed symptomatic COVID -19 occurred in the immunogenicity subset (n=10 in total, 2 in the active arm and 8 in the placebo arm) the number is considered too small to make any clear conclusions on any clinical impact of the reduced immune response and the impact of this is therefore considered unknown. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 30 In the supportive study 501 a limited amount of immunogenicity data is available in the interim report in participants with medically stable HIV. In HIV seropositive participants that were seropositive f or SARS -CoV -2 at baseline, the neutralising antibody GMTs for HIV were comparable to those seen for HIV -negative participants. In HIV positive participants that were seronegative for SARS -CoV -2 at baseline , neutralising antibody responses were somewhat low er than those seen in HIV negative participants, but the seroconversion rate remained high (98%). IV.4 Clinical efficacy Clinical efficacy data are available from two pivotal phase 3 trials, 2019nCoV -301 and 2019nCoV -302, and a supportive phase 2 trial, 2019nCoV -501. Pivotal study 2019nCoV -301 Methods Study 1 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer -blinded, placebo -controlled study in participants 18 years of age and older in United States and Mexico. Upon enrolment, participant s were stratified by age (18 to 64 years and 65 years) and assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive NVX -CoV2373 or placebo. Enrolment of adults completed in February 2021. Participants will be followed for up to 24 months after the second dose for assessments of safety, and efficacy against COVID -19. The trial also includes a blinded crossover period in which subjects were re -vaccinated with 2 injections of alternative study product 21 days apart following accrual of sufficient efficacy and safety data to supp ort application for Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The blinded crossover period commenced on 20 April 2021. All participants were offered the opportunity to continue to be followed in the study. Study parti cipants The trial included healthy male or female participants aged 18 years and older, who did not have a history of laboratory -confirmed (by PCR or serology to SARS -CoV -2) COVID -19 infection at any time prior to randomisation. The trial focussed on enro lment of participants at high risk of complications due to COVID -19 due to underlying coming comorbidities or living/working conditions. Participants with stable chronic medical conditions were not excluded unless participants were immunocompromised (iatro genic or pathogenic), had an autoimmune disease/condition or a current diagnosis of or treatment for cancer. Further, pregnant and breastfeeding women were also excluded from participation. Additionally, normal inclusion and exclusion criteria appropriate for a vaccine trial were in place. Statistical analysis The primary efficacy analysis set was defined as the per protocol efficacy population ( PP- EFF), consisting of all randomised participants without major protocol deviations that occurred before the first COVID -19 positive episode , who are seronegative (for SARS -CoV - 2) at baseline and do not have a laboratory confirmed current SARS -CoV -2 infection with symptom onset up to 6 days after the second dose, and who have received bo th doses less than 45 days apart. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 31 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint Vaccine Efficacy of PCR -Confirmed SARS -CoV -2 Positivity with Symptomatic Mild, Moderate, or Severe COVID -19 from 7 days after Second Vaccination in the initial vaccination period in in participants serologically negative (to SARS -CoV -2) at baseline. The same analysis method was used as was used for the primary analysis in trial 302 (a Poisson regression model with robust variance). The primary efficacy analysis was conducted with da ta collected up to the blinded crossover. The participants' follow -up time ended after reaching the first occurrence of any of the following events: a positive endpoint definition, the participant terminated from the study early, the participant died, the participant completed the study as scheduled, the study was stopped early, start of any PCR -confirmed illness episode, any positive PCR result after screening, participant entered the blinded crossover, occurrence of major protocol deviation, the participa nt was unblinded to treatment assignment, or database extract date. The analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint included all data prior to the blinded crossover which was initiated following the accumulation of the median 2 -month (60 days) safety follow -up. The result of the primary analysis was considered positive if the lower bound of the 2 -sided 95% confidence interval for VE was greater than 30%. Based upon the number of primary efficacy endpoints planned for analysis, a lower bound of more than 30% corresponds with a vaccine efficacy point estimate of at least 50%. Results An interim study report has been provided that describes the efficacy and safety results in adults following the initial set of vaccinations until each participant's fir st blinded crossover vaccination or as of the data cut -off date of 31 May 2021. The interim report excludes data from the blinded adult crossover period . Study population PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 32 Figure 4: Study participant flow A higher percentage of subjects discontinued the study in the placebo group (8.1% ) compared with the NVX -CoV2373 group (3.9%). The most frequent reasons for study discontinuation were 'withdrawal by participant' and 'Lost to follow -up'. The percentage of subjects that discontinued due to an adverse event was very low and balanced between the two treatment groups. Approximately 18% of participants were unblinded to study treatment assignment during the course of the study. In almost all cases, the reason was to receive an authorised vacci ne. There was an imbalance between treatment groups with a higher proportion of placebo recipients (23.4%) requesting unblinding than vaccine recipients (15.2%), observed for most clinical sites. No obvious association between reactogenicity profile and re quest for unblinding has been observed. Overall, the demographics and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the 2 treatment groups. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 33 Table 8: Demographics and baseline characteristics (PP -EFF analysis set) PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 34 The age range of participants was 18 -95 years with a median age of 47 years. Approximately 11.8% of participants were 65 years of age. Approximately half the participants were male, while the majority (75.9%) were White (78.2%) and located in the United States (94.0%). The majority of participants were overweight or obese (69.9%), with more than a third being obese (37.2%). Most participants (95.2%) were categorized as high -risk adults for acquiring or experiencing complications of COVID -19. Baseline characteristics were similar between the PP -EFF and safety analysis sets. In the safety analysis set, baseline serostatus was balanced between the 2 treatments groups with most participants seronegative at baseline (NVX -CoV2373: 93.7%, placebo: 93.1%). Overall, data analysis sets were generally well balanced between the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 35 Table 9: Analysis sets (All randomised participants) Primary efficacy endpoint Results are presented for the primary efficacy analysis which was triggered when 60 -day median safety follow -up was achieved. The data cut -off for this analysis was 19 April 2021, at which point there were 77 cases eligible for the primary endpoint. The study has successfully achieved its primary objective . The vaccine efficacy point estimate was 90.4% (95% CI: 82.9, 94.6) with a lower bound of the 95% confidence interva l >30%. As the point estimate was above 50% and the confidence interval lower bound ab ove 30%, efficacy was also shown in line with the target profile outlined by WHO for COVID -19 vaccines.

Efficacy resul ts reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when strains classified as Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest were predominantly circulating in the two countries where the study was conducted. Sequencing data were available for 61 of the 77 endpoint cases (79%). Of these, 48 out of 61 (79%) were identified as Variants of Concern or Variants of Interest. The most common Variants of Concern identified were: Alpha with 31/61 cases (51%), Beta (2/61, 4%) (2/61, 4%), while the most c ommon Variants of Interest Iota with injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 36 Severe cases and hospitalisations No cases of severe COVID -19 were reported in the 17,312 NVX -CoV2373 participants compared with 4 cases of severe COVID -19 reported in the 8,140 placebo recipients in the PP-EFF analysis set. No cases in either treatment group required hospitalisation. Protection after first dose The figure below displays cumulative incidence for the first COVID -19 occurrence after Dose 1 a mong all vaccinated participants. Disease incidence is similar for the vaccine and placebo groups until around day 14 -21 after dose 1, at which point the curves diverge, suggesting onset of protection from this point. Figure 5: Cumulative Incidence Curve of PCR -Confirmed Symptomatic Mild, Moderate, or Severe COVID -19 with Onset from First Vaccination in Adult Participants Regardless of Baseline Serostatus (Full Analysis Set) Pivotal study 2019nCoV -302 Methods Study 2 is an ongoing Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, observer -blinded, placebo -controlled study in participants 18 to 84 years of age in the United Kingdom. Upon enrolment, participants were stratified by age (18 to 64 years; 65 to 84 years) and assigne d in a 1:1 ratio to receive to receive NVX -CoV2373 or placebo. Enrolment was completed in November 2020. Participants are being followed for up to 12 months after the primary vaccination series for assessments of safety and efficacy against PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 37 COVID -19. Following permission by regulatory bodies based on achieving the primary efficacy endpoint and an acceptable safety profile , the study includes a blinded crossover period beginning three months following the second dose . Participant s who initially received NVX -CoV2373 would be revaccinated with two doses of placebo given 21 days apart. Similarly, participant s who initially received placebo would be revaccinated with 2 doses of NVX -CoV2373 . The blinded crossover period commenced on 29 March 2021 . Study particip ants As for study 301, the trial focussed on enrolment of participants at high risk of complications due to COVID -19 due to underlying coming comorbidities or living/working conditions. The main inclusion/exclusion criteria were also generally similar to those for study 302. Statistical analysis As in study 301, the primary analysis was conducted in the PP -EFF population. The analysis was performed based only on the data generated prior to the blinded crossover. Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint First occurrence of virologically confirmed, symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID -19 with onset from at least 7 days after second study vaccination in the initial set of vaccinations in participants serologically negative (to SARS -CoV -2) at baseline . A Poisson regression model with robust variance (Zou 2004) was used as the primary efficacy analysis model to estimate the relative risk (RR) of the incidence of SARS -CoV -2 virologically -confirmed primary symptomatic COVID -19 between the NVX -CoV2373 an d placebo groups. The model contain ed the term s of treatment group, age group (18 to 64 years / 65 to 84 years) and region (pooled sites) . The pooling of sites into regions was determined and documented prior to breaking the blind. The natural log of the surveillance time was used as an offse t variable in the model to adjust for volunteers having different follow up times. Vaccine efficacy (VE), which is the incidence of infection in the vaccine group relative to the incidence of infection in the control group expressed as a percentage, was calculated as VE (%) = (1 - RR) \u00d7 100. The VE, and its corresponding 2 -sided (1 -) % confidence interv al (CI), will be estimated from the model. The one -sided p -value for the test of VE 30% was also calculated from the model. The Clopper -Pearson exact binomial method was used in if there was a low number of events, or if the modified Poisson regression model did not converge (i.e., zero counts in 1 study vaccine group or stratum). An interim analysis and a final analysis were planned. The interim analysis was planned for when approximately 50 COVID -19 cases fulfilling criteria for the primary endpoint as described above had occurred. The final analysis was planned for when approximately 100 cases had occurred. The interim and final analyses for the primary objective in the PP -EFF population were carried out at the overall one -sided Type I error rate o f 0.025. The nominal 1 -sided alpha was planned to be 0.01550 at the interim analysis and 0.01387 at the final analysis. If an unplanned additional interim analysis if the timing of a planned analysis is modified, the Lan -PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 38 DeMets alpha -spending function was to be used to adjust the nominal alphas to maintain the overall one -sided type I error at 0.025. The result of the primary analysis was considered positive at either the interim or final analysis if the lower bound of the alpha adjusted confidence interv al for VE was greater than 30%. Results An interim study report has been provided. The data cut -off date of the interim efficacy analysis was 10 January 2021, the data cut -off date for the final efficacy analysis was 29 January 2021, and the data cut -off date for all other analyses was 23 February 2021. The interim report excludes data from the blinded adult crossover period. Study population Figure 6: Study participant flow The percentage of subjects that discontinued the study is low and balanced between the vaccine (2.3%) and placebo (2.7%) arms with very few subjects discontinuing due to an adverse event. Approximately one -third of participants in both study arms were unblinded to study vaccine assignment during the course of the study. In almost all subjects this was because they PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 39 wished to receive an approved vaccine. The vast majority of unblinded subjects continue to be followed up for safety. Overall, t he demographics and baseline characteristics in the primary analysis population (PP-EFF) are well balanced across the vaccine and placebo arms. Table 11: Demographics and baseline characteristics (PP -EFF analysis set) PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 40 There are similar percentages of males and females. Subjects range from 18 -84 years of age, with a median age of 56 . Approximately 28% of subjects were between 65 and 84 years of age. The vast majority of subjects were white (94.5%). Subjects with a comorbidity are well represented in the population (44.6%) and 26% of subjects are obese (BMI >30). With the expected exception of Day 0 PCR and SARS -CoV -2 serostatus, the demographics and baseline characteristics are similar and well balanced in the ITT analysis set. Approximately 4% of subjects in the vaccine and placebo arms were seropositive at baseline in the ITT population. Overall, data analysis sets were generally well balanced between the NVX -CoV2373and placebo groups. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 41 Table 12: Analysis sets (All randomised subjects analysis set) Primary efficacy endpoint Results are presented for the interim efficacy analysis based on a data cut -off of 10 January 2021 and for the final efficacy analysis based on a data -cut-off of 29 January 2021. There were 62 cases observed at the time of the interim analysis, which is cl ose to the approximately 50 planned. The pre -specified 1 -sided alpha level of 0.01550 was used, meaning inference was based upon 2 -sided 96.9% confidence intervals. As the interim analysis was positive, the final analysis is not formally inferential and th e full 1 -sided 2.5% alpha could be used to present the results at this analysis along with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals. Confirmatory interim analysis The study has successfully achieved its primary objective. The vaccine efficacy point estimate was 89.3% (alpha adjusted 96.9% CI: 73.0, 95.8) with an alpha adjusted lower bound of the confidence interval >30%. As the point estimate was above 50% and the confidence interval lower bound above 30%, efficacy was also shown in line with the target profile outlined by WHO for COVID -19 vaccines.

PLWH were medically stable (free of opportunistic infections), receiving highly active and stable antiretroviral therapy, and having an HIV -1 viral load of < 1000 copies/mL. Enrolment was completed in November 2020 . Participants were randomised 1:1 to receive NVX -CoV2373 or placebo. At 6 months after the last vaccination in the initial vaccination period, participants were to be given the option to enter into the crossover vaccin ation period. The duration of the study, excluding screening, was to be approximately 12 months after the last vaccination in the initial vaccination period. The primary endpoint was PCR -confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID - 19 in serologi cally na\u00efve (to SARS -CoV -2) healthy HIV -negative and medically stable HIV - positive adult participants, analysed overall, with a lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for VE above 0 , from 7 days after the second vaccine dose until the endpoint -driven efficacy analysis is triggered by the occurrence of a prespecified number of blinded endpoints across the 2 study vaccine arms and/or at prespecified time points during the initial vaccination period. The pre -specified success criteria would not satisfy the WHO criteria but would demonstrate that the vaccine is better than placebo. Results PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 44 Study population In total, 4,419 subjects were randomised (4,173 HIV -negative and 246 HIV -positive). At the cut-off date, 4,325 (97.9%) were continuing in follow -up and 94 (2.1%) had discontinued the study. Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups, overall and by HIV status. Of participants, 94% were HIV -negative. Median age was 28 years (range: 18 to 1% were Asian; and 2% were Hispanic or Latino. At baseline, 34.1% of participants were seropositive for SARS -CoV -2. For HIV positive participants, the majority (63.9%) had no co -morbidities. Median baseline CD4 level was 738 cells/L (range 80 to 2,076 cells/L) and median baseline HIV viral load was 63.5 copies/mL (range 20 to 735 copies/mL). The PP -EFF was the main population for the efficacy analysi s. The PP -EFF Analysis Set included the NVX -CoV2373 group and 1,362 (61.7%) in the placebo group. The main reasons for exclusion from the PP -EFF analysis set were positive PCR test or PCR -confirmed illness episode before 7 days after second study vaccination (n=1,488, 33.7%) and missed 1 dose of study vaccine (n=148, 3.3%). Primary efficacy endpoint Results are presented for the official event -driven analysis based on a data cut -off of 18 January 2021, at which point there were 44 cases eligible for the primary endpoint , which is in the range of 23 -50 events that was planned . Results are also presented for the complete analysis as of 23 February 2021 when there were 147 cases. Official event -driven analysi s The vaccine efficacy point estimate was 49.4% (95% CI: 6.1, 72.8) . The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for VE from 7 days after dose 2 was > 0% so the study is positive by the pre -specified statistical criteria and has demonstrated better VE than placebo. As the lower bound was not > 30% and the point estimate was not greater than 50% efficacy consistent with WHO criteria was not shown.

The confidence interval lower bound was again > 0%. The greater number of cases lead to the confidence interval lower bound being close to the WHO threshold of 30%, although the point estimate was still below 50%. If HIV negative participants are considered alone, the WHO criteria are satisfied (VE 54.5%, 95% CI: 37.5, 67.0). It is noted that few HIV positive subjects were enrolled in this trial (5.5%) with only a few symptomatic COVID -19 cases accrued in these subjects. These results reflect enrolment that occurred during the time period when t he B.1.351 (Beta) variant was circulating in South Africa . Severe cases and hospitalisations No cases of severe COVID -19 were reported in NVX -CoV2373 participants compared with 5 cases reported in placebo recipients in the PP -EFF complete analysis set. Five cases in the placebo group required hospitalisation. IV.5 Clinical safety Safety populat ion and exposure Across the 4 clinical trials, a total of 49,950 participants aged 18 years and older received at least one dose of NVX -CoV2373 (n=30,058) at the proposed dose for licensure (5-g SARS - CoV -2 rS with 50 g Matrix -M adjuvant ), or placebo (n= 19,892). Over 96% of NVX - CoV2373 and placebo both doses of -CoV2373 /placebo. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection Dossier, Regulation 50 46 Table 16: Number of participants by trial included in the pooled analysis of safety data The median duration of follow -up in the pooled safety database was 70 days post dose 2. This is shorter than the median follow -up in the individual studies due to censoring at unblinding in the pooled analysis. Demographic characteristics of subjects in the pooled analysis were generally well balanced betwee n the NVX -CoV2373 and placebo groups . Table 17: Demographic characteristics of participants in the pooled analysis of safety data PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 47 Local and systemic reactogenicity Solicited local and systemic adverse events were collected for 7 days after each vaccine dose in studies 101, 301, 501 and a subset of participants in study 302. Grading of solicited adverse events was based on FDA Toxicity Grading Scale for Clinical Abnormalities. Table 18: Solicited Local Adverse Events for 7 Days Following Each Vac cination Across the SARS - CoV -2 rS Clinical Development Programme PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 48 Table 19: Solicited Systemic Adverse Events for 7 Days Following Each Vaccination Across the SARS -CoV -2 rS Clinical Development Programme PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 49 Overall, there were higher frequencies of solicited adverse events in vaccine recipients compared with those that received placebo. With the exception of study 501, i n the vaccine arm the frequency and intensity of events increased after the second vaccine compared with the first. The majority of participants reported grade 1 or 2 events following each vaccination. In the vaccine arm in studies 301 and 302, grade 3 solicited local events were reported in 1% of participants after the 1st dose and 5% - 7% after the 2nd dose, for systemic events the incidence was 1% - 2% and 7% - 12%. A small number of participants reported grade 4 events. The most frequent solicited local events following each vaccination were tenderness and pain, and the most frequent solicited system ic events following each vaccination were fatigue, muscle pain, and headache. The frequency and intensity of solicited adverse events was lower in participants 65 years of age compared with those aged 18 -64 years. The majority of grade 3 and 4 events occu rred in the younger age group. All solicited local and systemic adverse events are considered adverse drug reactions (ADRs). T his is reflected in the product information. An apparent different pattern in reactions was observed in study 501 compared to st udies 301 and 302. Lower rates of local and systemic reactions were reported, with no increase after the second dose compared to the first, and reactions were also less often severe. As the reason for this discrepancy between studies is not clear, the rate s of reactions reflected in the product information is based on studies 302 and 301 only. The results from studies 301 and 302 are considered sufficiently large and of adequate methodology to characterise the reactogenicity profile. Unsolicited adverse ev ents Overall, t here were higher frequencies of unsolicited treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) within 49 days after first vaccination among NVX -CoV2373 recipients than among placebo recipients . This difference was largely due to reactogenicity event s extending beyond the 7 -day post -injection window . Unsolicited TEAEs were mostly mild, with severe events occurring in < 1% of participants. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 50 Table 20: Frequencies of unsolicited adverse events reported from after start of first vaccination through 28 days after second vaccination (for example Day 49) in 0.5% of participants in the pooled analysis of safety data Abbreviations: MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; TEAE = treatment emergent adverse event. Note: Frequency of TEAEs in each system organ class represents all TEAEs. Note: Results are presented as n (%) of total number of participants in each treatment group. Whilst overall there was no imbalance seen in reports of hypertension in the pooled safety data (0.49% in the NVX -CoV2373 group vs 0.46% in the placebo group), an increased incidence of hypertension following NVX -CoV2373 (1.0%) as compared to placebo (0.6%) was observed in older adults during the 3 days following vaccination. 'Hypertension' is included as an adverse event in the product information. In study 301 there was an imbalance in reports of adverse events related to inflammation of the eye, dysmenorrhoea and menstruation irregular. However, these imbalances were not seen in the other clinical trials and are based on a small number of reports. Adverse events PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 51 related to inflammation of the eye and menstrual disorders will be closely followed in the Monthly Safety Summary Reports (MSSRs)/Periodic safety update reports (PSURs). No events of anaphylaxis have been reported in the clinical trials. Th ere were 8 reports of allergy to vaccine and 3 reports of hypersensitivity in NVX -CoV2373 recipients . None of the three hypersensitivity events are considered related to NVX -CoV237. Upon review of the narratives of the 8 reports of 'allergy to the vaccine' , these were mostly reactogenicity related events rather than clear hypersensitivity reactions to the vaccine. There was one case which may concern true hypersensitivity, namely an erythematous patch on the hand and itchiness as mild in intensity with onse t 10 minutes after vaccination, which was resolved within 3 hours. Serious adverse events The number of deaths reported across the studies was very low and balanced between the vaccine and placebo group s. None of the deaths were considered related to stu dy vaccine. Overall, the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was low and balanced between the vaccine and placebo groups. Numerical imbalances in SAEs of cholecystitis (9 vs 0) and Cerebrovascular accident (7 vs 1) were seen in study 30 1. Similar imbalances were not seen in the other clinical studies, all participants had at least one underlying risk factor and there was no consistent pattern in the time from last vaccine dose to onset of symptoms. T hese events will be kept under review in MSSRs/PS URs. A numerical imbalance was also seen in SAEs of prostate cancer (5 vs 0) in study 301 only. Considering the short latency between the diagnoses of prostate cancer, the presence of underlying risk factors, the absence of biological plausibility and the number of cases observed being within the expected cases based on background rates, the events of prostate cancer are considered unlikely related to NVX -CoV2373 . There were 3 SAEs of myocarditis reported : 2 in the vaccine group and one in the placebo group . Three additional cases of myocarditis/pericarditis were identified post vaccine cross over. A possible alternative aetiology was identified in all 5 cases reported in the vaccine group . However, as myocarditis and pericarditi s are known adverse events for some of the approved COVID -19 vaccines (mRNA vaccines) and because a possible causal role of vaccination could not be excluded in 3 cases due to the time to onset from last vaccination, 'Myocarditis/Pericarditis' is included in the RMP as an ' Important potential risk'. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 52 Table 21: Serious Adverse Events Reported from After Start of First Vaccination Through the Respective Data Cut -off Dates of the Individual Clinical Trials with an Incidence Rate > 0.05 e/100 PY in the Pooled A nalysis of Safety Data Abbreviations: e/100 PY = events per 100 person -years; MedDRA = Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SAE = serious adverse event; NVX -CoV2373 = 5 g SARS -CoV -2 rS with 50 g Matrix -M adjuvant; SARS -CoV -2 rS = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine. 1. One event of prostate cancer was censored from the pooled analysis of safety data because the event occurred after the unblinding date (this event was included in the 2019nCoV -301 Interim Report). Note: Results are presented as number of events per 100 person -years, with the event rate in parentheses. Adverse events of special interest Adverse events of special interest included potential immune -mediated medical conditions (PIMMCs) as well as adverse events related to COVID -19. No imbalances in AESI were seen in studies 302, 501 or 101. However, in study 301 an apparent higher incidence of PIMMCs was reported in the NVX -CoV2373 group compa red with placebo. The type of events reported are diverse, with no clear patterns emerging aside PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 53 from the overall imbalance. Furthermore, w hilst exploring this signal, the applicant conducted a MedDRA SMQ which identified additional events in both treatmen t groups not reported by investigators and therefore not included in the original analysis . This updated analysis did not suggest an imbalance . Laboratory findings Clinical laboratory findings were only reported for study 2019nCoV -101 (Part 1), where haematology and serum chemistry formed part of the safety assessments. No concerns are raised from this data. Across the clinical studies t here were similar rates of laboratory investigation TEAEs for NVX -CoV2373 compared with placebo. Safety in special p opulations Pregnancy and breastfeeding Women who were pregnant or breastfeeding were excluded from the clinical trials. As such, there is limited experience with NVX -CoV2373 in pregnancy. Up to 26 October 2021, 137 pregnancies have been reported of which 95 received NVX -CoV2373 and 42 received placebo. Of the 95 pregnancies reported in participants in the NVX -CoV2373 group, 8 resulted in live births, 11 underwent voluntary termination, 16 resulted in spontaneous abortion, and 60 were eith er ongoing (55) or the outcome of the pregnancy was unknown (5). There were no foetal deaths or stillbirths reported in the clinical development program. There are no data available on the safety of NVX -CoV2373 administered during breastfeeding. 'Use in pregnancy and whilst breastfeeding' is proposed for inclusion in the RMP as 'Missing information'. Planned additional pharmacovigilance activities include a Pregnancy and Infant Outcomes Safety Study using the \"COVID -19 Vaccines International Pregnancy Exposure Registry (C -VIPER) Paediatric population The proposed indication is in subjects aged 18 years and over. No data was provided in this submission for subjects less than 18 years of age. A national paediatric investigation plan has been agreed and a d eferral granted: MHRA -100149 -PIP01 -21. Immunosuppression Participants with any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient state were excluded from the clinical trials. 'Use in immunocompromised patients' is included as 'Missing information' in the RMP with a number of additional pharmacovigilance activities planned to address this. In study 501 the safety of NVX -CoV2373 was evaluated in 244 HIV positive participants aged 18 to 64 years of age (122 in each treatment group). The se participants were required to be medically stable (including having been completely free of opportunistic infection in PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 54 the 1 year prior to the first study vaccination), receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (and been using the same regimen with in at least 8 weeks before screening), and have a HIV - 1 viral load < 1000 copies/mL within 45 days of randomization. In this small subset of medically stable HIV positive participants, there was no clear pattern of a differential safety profile of NVX -CoV2 373 by HIV status. SARS -CoV-2 serostatus at baseline Available data does not suggest that baseline serostatus impacts the reactogenicity (frequency of solicited AEs) or safety of NVX -CoV2373 with very similar rates of treatment emergent solicited and uns olicited AEs reported in both participants seropositive as well as seronegative at baseline. Safety related to interactions An exploratory licensed seasonal influenza co -administration sub -study was conducted as part of study 302. Licensed inactivated seasonal influenza vaccines were co -administered to participants on the same day as Dose 1 of NVX -CoV2373 (n = 217) or placebo (n = 214) in the opposite deltoid muscle of the arm . The frequency of solicited local and systemic adverse reactions in the influenza sub -study population was higher than that in the main study population following Dose 1 in both NVX -CoV2373 and placebo recipients. However, t he intensity of events was similar with the majority of subjects in the vaccine arm repo rting grade 1 events following their first dose. The incidence of grade 3 events remained low and similar between those included/not included in the influenza substudy . Discontinuations due to adverse events There were few discontinuations (vaccination/s tudy) due to treatment emergent adverse events . Overall, there were slightly more discontinuations in the vaccine group compared with placebo, this was largely due to reactogenicity events e.g. headache, injection -site pain, myalgia. IV.6 Risk Management Plan (RMP) The applicant has submitted a n RMP, in accordance with the requirements of Regulation 182 of The Human Medicines Regulation 2012, as amended. The applicant proposes only routine pharmacovigilance and routine risk minimisation measures for all sa fety concerns. This is acceptable. PAR Nuvaxovid dispersion for injection PLGB 54180/0002 Full Dossier, Regulation 50 55 IV.7 Discussion on the clinical aspects Clinical immunogenicity The immune response data in the interim reports support the choice of a two -dose schedule of Nuvaxovid, with no apparent advantage for 25 over 5 \u00b5g antigen doses in the adjuvanted formulations. The final clinical study reports from studies 2019nCoV -101 part 1 and 2, 2019nCoV -301, 2019nCoV -302 and 2019nCoV -501 should be submitted as soon as these are available . This is captured in the RMP. Three clin ical immunogenicity recommendations are made: the applicant should i) investigate the need of a booster dose, ii) detail their plans to establish an immunologic correlate of protection, and iii) investigate (with regular updates) the ability of the vaccine to neutralise emerging SARS -CoV -2 variants . Clinical efficacy Robust and high protective short -term efficacy against COVID -19 has been demonstrated in individuals aged 18 years and older in two pivotal observer blinded placebo controlled trials. The vac cine is efficacious across different high -risk groups including older adults, as well as subjects considered at increased risk of severe disease due to underlying chronic disease. Whilst lower vaccine efficacy was observed in a supportive trial 2019nCoV -501 in South Africa, this was possibly due to reduced efficacy against the Beta variant circulating at that time. Clinical safety Overall, the short -term safety profile of Nuvaxovid in individuals aged 18 years and older is adequately characterised and app ears acceptable. The safety population, exposure and duration of follow -up are considered acceptable in the context of a conditional marketing authorisation application for a COVID -19 vaccine. Safety data corresponding to longer follow -up will be submitted as laid out in the Risk Management Plan.
