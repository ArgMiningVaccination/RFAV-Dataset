The Integrative Primary Care Practice for a Healthier Asheville The Status Quo Isn't working for Most Patients - We're Different We believe that health care can be done differently. We are an Asheville-based integrative direct primary care practice that emphasizes the relationship between doctor and patient and takes into account the whole person. Our goal is to partner with each patient to help them live their best lives and take charge of their health. We practice evidence-based western medicine and prioritize prevention-focused interventions. Our direct-payment model (also known as Direct Primary Care) works to restore the personal relationship with your physician and removes the insurance obstacles that could prevent us from focusing on our patient's overall health. INTEGRATIVE PRIMARY CARE Personalized medicine with a team-based approach SIMPLY BETTER PAYMENT MODEL Easy membership fee includes wholesale labs, pharmacy, procedures, and more EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE Affordable, quality health care for your business What our Patients are Saying... I am thankful for you all. Liz, Tom, Logan, Brandi, Krystal, Brian, Katey, and all the rest I haven't met or didn't know your name...This is by far the safest place I have to come to for support. ANONYMOUS Verified Patient I appreciated having so much time to tell my story and have Jen listen attentively, to learn more about me so we can find effective ways to address my issues. ANONYMOUS Verified Patient I'm so floored with all the staff here...! However my experience with Katey was beyond any I would get anywhere else. We had to discuss some pretty heavy topics and try to figure out some very intimidating issues, and I'm not sure I have ever felt so heard by a doctor. ANONYMOUS Verified Patient As always, Dr. Krisel is an excellent listener, explains conditions in a clear and understandable manner, and provides solutions adapted to each patient. ANONYMOUS Verified Patient Elizabeth provides the best medical care I've ever received. Moreover, she's a joy to meet with. We actually look forward to our appointments. ANONYMOUS Verified Patient LOVE this group .. everyone is so friendly and concerned and organized. Dr. Brian positively exudes care and concern and an optimistic holistic approach. I believe this may be exactly what I have been looking for in health care. DANA Verified Patient Dr. Cox is knowledgeable, compassionate, and nonjudgmental. Her style of practice removes the typical doctor-patient power hierarchy so that the focus is entirely upon her patients and advancing their health goals together. Highly recommend! ANONYMOUS Verified Patient Tom was very grounded, present and thorough during our time together. I felt like he listened to everything I expressed and painted a clear picture of how we will go about tackling my concerns.
