The therapy developed from investigations carried out in the 18th century by a German physician, Dr Samuel Hahnemann, who discovered the basic principle of Homoeopathy: Like is cured by like, or Similia Similibus Curantur. Hahnemann noted certain similarities between symptoms produced by some diseases and the drugs used to treat them. He experimented on himself with Peruvian Bark, producing all the symptoms of Malaria, but this source of quinine was later used with some success to cure malaria. He followed-up his original observations experimenting on colleagues, friends and himself; forming the theory: A disease can be cured by whatever medicine produces similar symptoms when given to a healthy animal or person. Called the Law of Similars, its beauty is that treatment goes with, rather than against, the body's own efforts to regain health - very much like a vaccination. Specially prepared substances used as remedies in homoeopathy contain minute doses of herbs, minerals, animal products such as bee venom, cuttlefish ink, and other products. These products are diluted so only a minuscule amount ever actually enters the body. Sometimes dilution is so extreme it goes far beyond the point where the substance could act through molecular strength, so there is much debate about how these greatly diluted substances actually work. Many homoeopaths believe the remedies carry information derived from the original material, while others believe magnetic forces come into play. Strange as it may seem, the higher the dilution, the more potent the remedy is. Scientific Quantum Physics shows now that each homeopathic remedy actually carries different crystals and information. We know a bee sting will cause a certain type of reaction e.g. swelling, fluid accumulation, skin redness and pain, and soreness which is accentuated by applying heat or pressure. If a homoeopathetically prepared dilute solution of bee venom is given to an animal or human with these symptoms, even if they are caused by something other than a bee sting, the condition will clear up. The essential feature is that there is close similarity between the remedy and the condition for it to work properly. The medicinal effect is thought to be that when the body is disturbed (diseased), any symptoms are its attempt to heal and restore balance. We know that inflammation with redness, pain and swelling are primary defence tactics so the affected part is particularly sensitive to the action of a matching remedy acting like a catalyst to boost the self-healing process. In comparison, standard drugs are usually used to: take the place of normal body processes (hormonal drugs), inhibit body responses (painkillers, anti-inflammatory drugs, antihistamines) or weaken or kill bacteria or cancer cells (antibiotics, chemotherapy, radiation treatment). Homoeopaths, on the other hand consider that the individual has only one disorder which can create many symptoms and idiosyncratic characteristics. Therefore, only one remedy is administered at a time - the one thought to be the best catalyst for the body's total defense response. Homoeopathic treatment is widely used and recognised all over Europe. Around one in four German Veterinary Surgeons use homoeopathic treatment to compliment Western orthodox medicine.
