The safety of our patients, always of tantamount importance, has taken on new facets. Gary N. Holland, MD, Jack H. Skirball Chair in Ocular Inflammatory Diseases, has a leadership role in fighting against the spread of COVID-19 both here in the United States and beyond. A renowned infectious disease specialist, Dr. Holland and two colleagues were asked by the American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) to create guidelines for ophthalmologists on preventing transmission of this highly contagious virus during eye examinations and surgery. Their authored pages on the AAO website have been viewed over 1.5 million times as of this writing. Many of our educational events this academic year were cancelled or held remotely. During the pandemic's height, our outpatient visits and surgical procedures were down to 25% of normal, and we were only seeing urgent or emergent cases. In the current ramp up, we are now at over 80% of pre-COVID levels for outpatient care and exceeding pre-COVID surgical cases, perhaps due to backlog. Preserving sight and ending avoidable blindness is our mission, and UCLA Department of Ophthalmology faculty, fellows, resi- dents, and staff are committed to this challenge. Demonstrating true collaboration and selflessness, their priority\u2014as it has been since the UCLA Stein Eye Institute opened its doors in 1966\u2014is focused on the health and well-being of our patients. Private funding, especially in these uncertain times, remains critical to our ability to advance vision science and clinical care. I wish you and your family well, and I thank you for your support. Sincerely, Bartly J. Mondino, MD Bradley R. Straatsma, MD, Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology Director, Stein Eye Institute Chairman, UCLA Department of Ophthalmology Affiliation Chairman, Doheny Eye Institute Impacting Eye Care on a Global Scale The UCLA Department of Ophthalmology's renowned International Fellowship Program has trained more than 250 ophthalmologists from countries worldwide\u2014doctors who not only become more accomplished clini - cians and researchers, but also trailblazers for improving vision care around the globe.Canada U.S. United States Mexico BrazilLibya EgyptIran IndiaChina Indonesia AustraliaRussia Chile ArgentinaHonduras El Salvador Colombia EcuadorUnited Kingdom France ItalySwitzerland Romania TurkeyArmenia Syria Jordan Saudi Arabia South AfricaUgandaNigeriaIraq BangladeshNepalPakistan VietnamHong KongTaiwan Philippines Malaysia SingaporeSouth Korea Japan IsraelSpain PeruGreece A Year in Review | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE 1 The International Fellowship Program is offered to ophthalmologists throughout the world and fea - tures a one-year immersion in training under the mentorship of faculty from the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology. The training for each fellow is unique\u2014 customized to meet the interests of the individual participant in subspecialties that include cataract; corneal-external ocu and strabismus; and vitreoretinal diseases. Since the Institute began training an annual cadre of inter - national fellows in the early 1990s, more than 250 fellows from countries worldwide have been certified. The Program is distinctly positioned to train international fellows because of the unique strengths of the UCLA medical enterprise. The broad range of services in premier UCLA-affiliated teaching hospitals and diverse patient populations across Southern California, depth of research programs, access to large-scale clinical trials, and connections to other medical and scien - tific programs on the UCLA campus provide an opportunity for enhanced study that is singular in ophthalmic training. \"We work to inspire a sense of responsibility for leader - ship and innovation that our international fellows can use to train the next generation of ophthalmologists around the world,\" says Bartly J. Mondino, MD , chair of the Department of Ophthalmology and director of the Stein Eye Institute. \"We achieve our greatest success when our fellows become the innovators in their own countries.\" International expertise: a two-way exchange The Program promotes interaction in research and educa - tion with ophthalmology institutions throughout the world, encouraging a two-way opportunity for learning, with the international fellows and Department doctors sharing their expertise and methods for dealing with the unique chal - lenges for vision care and research. \"The knowledge and perspective of our international fellows improves the experience and performance of our faculty, fellows, and residents here in Southern California,\" says Anne L. Coleman, MD, PhD , The Fran and Ray Stark Foundation Chair in Ophthalmology. \"Not only are the international fellows learning from us,\" says Dr. Coleman, \"but we are also learning from them, gaining insight into other cultures and countries in terms of how we can all treat patients with eye diseases, learn oph - thalmology, and conduct research. Their presence at UCLA adds to the vibrant, diverse, and inspiring environment that we have here.\" \"I chose the Fellowship Program because of its international reputation, and also because of my customized fellowship plan that combined exposure to the clinical and research aspects of glaucoma with study of epidemiology and public health issues.\" FOTIS TOPOUZIS, MD Chair, Department of Ophthalmology Aristotle University Thessaloniki, Greece UCLA INTERNATIONAL FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM \"The International Fellowship Program has contributed significantly to shaping the careers of doctors in many countries, and the Program has tirelessly contributed directly to the benefits of patients all over the world.\" RAMESH KEKUNNAYA, MD Director, Child Sight Institute L V Prasad Eye Institute Hyderabad, India 2 UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | A Year in Review\"I chose the Program for the superb faculty, the facilities of the Institute, and the reputation of the Program. The knowledge I acquired, the experience of working at a first-level Institute, and the professional relationships that came from my involvement have helped me to progress in my own career, and also to guide many colleagues in Latin America. Participating in the Fellowship Program is one of the best decisions I have ever made.\" FRANCISCO J. RODRIGUEZ, MD Chair, Department of Ophthalmology Universidad del Rosario School of Medicine Bogota, ColombiaAdvancing the fight against blindness for generations The importance of the Department's International Fellow - ship Program was underscored in October 2019, when the World Health Organization (WHO) released a new report on vision and preventable blindness. \"At present more than 2.2 billion people around the world have a vision impairment, of whom at least 1 billion have a vision impairment that could have been prevented or is yet to be addressed,\" states the WHO's World Report on Vision . \"The world faces considerable challenges in terms of eye care, including a shortage of trained eye care ser - vice providers.\" As such, perhaps the most important results produced by the International Fellowship Program are the ophthalmol - ogists worldwide that the Program never sees. The Program's primary mission is to train and build the expertise of the 10 to 20 international fellows who partici - pate each year. And key to that mission is inspiring a sense of commitment among the fellows to pass along their exper - tise to new generations of ophthalmologists in their own countries and beyond. \"Our international fellows elevate the practice of our spe - cialty in their country,\" says Robert Alan Goldberg, MD , Bert O. Levy Endowed Chair in Orbital and Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery. \"By teaching and practicing at the highest level, they innovate in their fields and become role models in their medical communities.\" The influence of the international fellows touches med - ical care, research, and training throughout the world, as evidenced by the clinics, academic departments, training programs, research teams, and eye care organizations established and nurtured by the Program alumni. \"We work to inspire a sense of responsibility for leadership and innovation that our international fellows can use to train the next generation of ophthalmologists around the world. We achieve our greatest success when our fellows become the innovators in their own countries.\" BARTLY J.

Holland, MD , Jack H. Skirball Chair in Ocular Inflammatory Diseases, is working with two other ocular infectious disease specialists, James Chodosh, MD, MPH , of Harvard University, and Steven Yeh, MD , of Emory University, to formulate guidelines for prevention of COVID-19 transmission during eye exam - inations and ophthalmic procedures in the midst of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and to provide American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) members with updated information relevant to the pan - demic through its website. In addition to reflecting changing statistics about the pandemic and to conform to Centers for Disease Con - trol (CDC) and other guidelines as they evolve, the team is answering ques - tions from AAO members seeking evidence-based clinical guidance on topics including 'how can I protect my staff and patients,' 'what personal protec - tive equipment do I need,' 'how do I dis - infect my office,' and 'do antivirals work.' David W. Parke II, MD , chief executive officer of the AAO, said of this work, \"This trio of incredibly talented ophthalmolo - gist clinician-scientists are the ultimate professional volunteers who, despite heavy clinical, teaching, and research responsibilities, gave up countless hours each week and weekend to ensure that the material on the Academy coronavirus web pages was updated at least daily and reflected careful science.\" As of June 30, 2020, the authored pages at www.aao.org/headline/alert- important-coronavirus-context had been viewed over 1.5 million times. To help reduce the spread of COVID-19, Stein Eye physicians like Dr. Tara McCannel (left) and Dr. Niranjan Manoharan (right) wear protective goggles and gloves during procedures. Rooms and equipment are cleaned and disinfected before every patient examination. New Grants Fund Vital Research Amounts shown are the total for all years of NIH funding.Research funding at UCLA from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is increas- ing, and the Stein Eye Institute is a significant beneficiary of this support, which is provided through the National Eye Institute (NEI). Seven new NIH grants were awarded in 2019 and total nearly $10 million in fund - ing. These grants give an indication of the scope of basic research within Stein Eye on key questions affecting the eye. A Year in Review | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE 5 New Clinic Focused on Treating Dry Eye Persistent and more serious forms of dry eye require focused diagnosis and treatment to maintain the health of your eye, and the new Dry Eye Clinic on the UCLA Stein Eye Institute vision-science campus was developed for this purpose. Dry eye occurs when the glands around the eye cease to produce enough tears to keep the surface of the eye moist. Dry eye can may be associated with aging, diabetes, autoimmune dis - eases, certain medications, and dry climates. \"The UCLA Stein Eye Institute's Dry Eye Clinic implements a full diagnostic workup looking at all the different parts of the ocular surface that can contribute to dry eye, and then we tailor a specialized treatment focused on each patient's indi - vidual needs\" says Vivian Shibayama, OD, ophthalmology, who runs the clinic with Saba Al-Hashimi, MD, health sciences assistant clinical professor of ophthalmology. The clinic also offers in-office proce - dures not typically available at eye cen - ters, such as BlephEx, LipiFlow, intense pulsed light therapy, scleral saline-filled contact lenses, amniotic membrane therapy, and autologous serum tears.

For detailed information about each faculty mem - ber, please refer to the Faculty and Col - leagues section of this Annual Report. Laura Bonelli, MD Health Sciences Assistant Clinical Professor Kaustabh Ghosh, PhD Associate Professor Monica R. Khitri MD, Health Sciences Assistant Clinical Professor Shawn R. Lin, MD Health Sciences Assistant Clinical Professor Yirong Peng, PhD Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology Edmund Tsui, MD Assistant ProfessorStein Eye and Doheny Eye Institutes Celebrate Five Years of Partnership Alumni from the Stein and Doheny Eye Institutes gathered for a reception on October 13, 2019, in San Francisco, California, and marked a five-year milestone. In 2014, the Doheny Eye Institute began its historic partnership with the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology. With that action, UCLA became the only univer - sity in the United States with two eye institutes: the Stein Eye Institute and the Doheny Eye Institute. In his speech to attendees, Bartly J. Mondino, MD , chair of the UCLA Depart - ment of Ophthalmology and affiliation chair for the Doheny Eye Institute, reflected on the brave leap of faith required by the USC faculty who were coming to a new home: \"I told the USC faculty they would be on the ground floor in estab - lishing something great\u2014this unprecedented and perhaps unique affiliation in ophthalmology.\" Trust in that promised outcome was justified. Doheny's partnership with UCLA has proven to be a bona fide success. Over 20 faculty have been recruited as a result of the affiliation, and between the two Institutes, there are 35 endowed chairs and more than 30 fellows. Doheny Eye Centers UCLA in Arcadia, Orange County, and Pasadena are operational, with strong upward trajectories in new visits, return visits, and surgeries. Just as importantly, the three Centers have returned a profit, which is noteworthy for medical centers with senior faculty, broad research, federal grants, and educational activities. Looking forward, the Doheny Eye Institute has purchased a state-of-the-art facility in Pasadena, with generous grounds for parking and future expansion. The building will include research labs, as well as educational and patient care facilities. The Doheny Eye Institute in \"Eastwood\" will be home to the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology's second vision-science campus, complementing the Stein Eye Institute's vision-science campus in Westwood, which was com - pleted in 2017, with the construction of the Edie & Lew Wasserman Building and renovation and seismic upgrade of the Jules Stein Building. \"Aside from the historic and remarkable affiliation,\" said Alfredo A. Sadun, MD, PhD, vice chair of ophthalmology at the Doheny Eye Center UCLA, \"I person - ally feel extremely gratified that the large core of former faculty, who, by voting with their feet demonstrated great courage in leaving USC, can now look back, five years after, knowing that their faith in UCLA, in our leadership, and in each other, was fully justified.\"The Doheny Eye Institute vision-science campus in Pasadena, anticipated opening 2021.

Instruc - tion concentrated on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and management of ophthalmologic disease. Directed by John A. Irvine, MD , and Mitra Nejad, MD , the 2020 course included contributions from guest faculty.Orbital Surgery Master's Symposium and Dissection Workshop Surgical specialists and practicing ophthalmologists from four continents participated in the UCLA Orbital Surgery Master's Symposium and Dissection Workshop on March 3-4, 2020, at the Stein Eye Institute vision-science campus in Westwood. The event focuses on practical techniques and conceptual pearls that participants can immediately apply to their own practice. Educational lectures included presentation of the Jack Rootman Lectureship in Orbital Disease by Gerald Harris, MD, chief of the Orbital and Oculoplastic Surgery Eye Institute at the Medical College of Wisconsin. The biennial program was chaired by Robert Alan Goldberg, MD, Bert O. Levy Endowed Chair in Orbital and Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery and chief of the Orbital and Ophthalmic Plastic Surgery Division, and Daniel B. Rootman, MD, MS , Karen and Frank Dabby Endowed Chair in Ophthalmology. Dr. Daniel Rootman instructs attendees at the Orbital Surgery Master's Symposium and Dissection Workshop. A Year in Review | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE 11 Community Outreach UCLA HEALTH IS DODGER BLUE! As part of the partnership between UCLA Health and the Los Angeles Dodgers, the UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic provides vision care at home games. (L to R): UCLA leadership, Dr. John Mazziotta, Dr. Robert Cherry, and Johnese Spisso (far right) with Dodgers' Manager, Dave Roberts. From July 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020, the UCLA Mobile Eye Clinic (UMEC) collab - orated with influential organizations, including the Los Angeles Dodgers, with whom they attended eight events and served over 170 patients. Based on these successful interactions, UMEC will be returning to Los Angeles Dodgers events in spring and summer 2021 to continue performing eye health screen - ings for underserved and undertreated Angelenos. Continuing to find ways to increase accessibility to vision care, UMEC part - nered in November 2019 with Care Harbor, a mega-clinic that focuses on grassroots health care solutions and has served over 26,000 patients in the last 10 years. At Care Harbor, UMEC's team addressed the needs of patients who had pre-existing eye health condi - tions, including diabetes and high blood pressure, to provide them with further examinations and referrals to special - ists as needed. At the three-day event, UMEC's diverse staff of multilingual oph - thalmologists, ophthalmic technicians, volunteers, and interns provided care for 262 patients with 105 referrals for follow-up care. During the holiday season, doctors, technicians, and staff from the Stein Eye and Doheny Eye Institutes\u2014along with volunteers\u2014provided eye health screen - ings at the Westside Thanksgiving Dinner and Celebration, an event that provides free medical, dental, and vision services. UMEC also participated in the Compre - hensive Community Health Centers Holi - day Health Fair in December, which helps individuals learn about health resources available to them. Ophthalmologists, staff, medical students, and volunteers also provided eye health screenings and reading glasses. In January 2020, UMEC participated in the 6th Annual Skid Row Carnival of Love where approximately 800 individuals experiencing home - lessness received a health screening and referral for follow-up from one of the many medical providers at the event. Eye health screenings and reading glasses were provided.UMEC also continued its preschool vision program during the 2019-2020 school year: 5,897 preschoolers were screened, 433 received eye exams, and 407 eyeglasses were provided to underserved preschool children in low- income communities in Los Angeles. UMEC referred 134 preschoolers to part - ner specialists for further specialized medical or surgical treatments. Since fall 2019, UMEC has had eight medical students from UCLA and other national and international universities assist with research projects. The med - ical students also assisted with provid - ing free vision care and shadowed the ophthalmologists on the UMEC. The UMEC also had 39 UCLA undergradu - ate interns and volunteers that assisted UMEC with several aspects of the orga - nization, including fundraising. Eleven of the undergraduate interns and volun - teers applied for medical school or other professional programs after graduation. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Stein Eye Institute suspended all community outreach operations in March 2020. Following approval from the UCLA COVID-19 Command Center, UMEC resumed community outreach on August 17, 2020. Personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies were secured to keep patients, faculty, and staff safe.

A Year in Review | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE 15 The End of an Era Celebrating the Work of Dr. Dean Bok Colleagues, friends, and family honored Dean Bok, PhD , the Dolly Green Chair of Ophthalmology, professor of ophthalmology emeritus, and distinguished research professor of neurobiology, at a retirement reception on March 11, 2020, at the UCLA Stein Eye Institute vision-science campus. Speaking to the gathered attendees, Bartly J. Mondino, MD , chair of the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology and director of the Stein Eye Institute, said, \"Dr. Bok is revered in vision science. He has been an extremely productive scientist and teacher, stalwart Departmental citizen, and formidable resource for mentoring in the Vision Science Division at UCLA. His scientific standing is matched by his personal characteristics of integrity, fairness, and loyalty.\" The primary focus of Dr. Bok's research has been the study of the interaction of photoreceptor cells with the retinal pigment epithelium in health and disease. His renowned scientific work has advanced our knowledge of the eye and has contrib - uted to the prevention of blindness. After thanking Dr. Mondino for his leadership of the Institute, Dr. Bok reflected on his 51 years as a member of Stein Eye and noted other Department colleagues who greatly influenced his career. \"My mentor in the Department of Anatomy (now Neurobiology) was Dr. Richard Young , whose seminal work on retinal photoreceptor cell biology had an impact that reverberates within the field of vision science to this day. Notable also was the presence of founding members of the Institute on my doc - toral committee, Drs. Michael Hall , Thomas Pettit , and Bradley Straatsma . From that time forward, Dr. Straatsma, founding chair of the Department and founding director of the Institute, has been one of my strongest supporters.\" Dr. Bok also recognized three members of his technical staff\u2014 Marcia Lloyd , Jane Hu , and Alberto Ruiz \u2014who he said, \"made my experience in the laboratory gratifying and productive.\" In addition to his research, Dr. Bok has served on scientific advisory boards of prestigious companies, foundations, and medical institutions. He is on the Board of Directors of the Macular Vision Research Foundation, and he has received substantial funding from the National Eye Institute (NEI) and numerous foundations for the entire Dr. Bartly Mondino (left) is shown with Dr. Dean Bok, whose renowned work has advanced our knowledge of the eye and has contributed to the prevention of blindness. tenure of his career and was instrumental in the NEI program planning for \"Vision Research-A National Plan: 1998-2003.\" Dr. Bok has authored approximately 150 publications and 25 book chapters. His decades of awards and honors include the Paul Kayser International Award in Retina Research from the Retina Research Foundation, the Llura Liggett Gund Lifetime Achievement Award from the Foundation Fighting Blindness, and the Helen Keller Prize for Vision Research from the Helen Keller Foundation. One of Dr. Bok's greatest contribu - tions to scientific discovery has been his mentorship of young investigators. Dr. Bok's ability to inspire future research - ers has been recognized with teaching awards throughout his career, including Professor of the Year, Professor Most Deserving of Commendation, Best Lec - turer, Best Academic Course, and Dis - tinguished Teaching Awards from the UCLA School of Dentistry and the UCLA Alumni Association. Capturing the emotion felt by all who were gathered, Dr. Mondino summed up the impact of Dr. Bok's retirement: \"It is the end of an era here at Stein Eye.\" 16 UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | A Year in ReviewPhilanthropy Congratulations to UCLA Department of Ophthalmology faculty on being honored with prestigious chair appointments.

Sonia Guha, PhD Assistant Project Scientist Unraveling New Therapeutic Targets for Ocular Albinism Dr. Guha studies genes that may be associated with the misrouting of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons at the brain's optic chiasm in X-linked ocular albinism type 1 ( OA1). This disease is also characterized by hypopigmentation and presence of macromelanosomes in the RPE. How the reduced pigmentation of OA1 RPE exerts its effects on the RGCs to influ - ence the misrouting of their axons at the optic chiasm remains unsolved, and Dr. Guha's findings have the potential to unravel new therapeutic targets for OA1.Doug Chung, PhD Assistant Project Scientist Corneal Endothelial Dystrophies Dr. Chung's research focus is eluci - dating the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of inherited corneal endothelial dystrophies in an effort to develop novel gene-based therapeutic approaches.

Although the diseases studied by Alfredo A. Sadun, MD, PhD , and his colleagues are rare, they are increasingly viewed as models for both ophthalmologic and non-oph - thalmologic conditions that affect much larger populations, but are more complex and difficult to study. Dr. Sadun, Flora L. Thornton Endowed Chair in Vision Research at Doheny and vice chair of ophthalmology, Doheny Eye Center UCLA, is part of six formal clinical trials in neuro-ophthalmology, making the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology group by far the most active neuro-oph - thalmology research group in the country. Neuro-ophthalmology is a subspecialty focusing on how the brain works with the eye and processes visual information, as well as how the eye sends messages to the brain. From the beginning of his career, Dr. Sadun has been a leader in the lat - ter, also known as the afferent pathway. In particular, Dr. Sadun and his col - leagues have concentrated on the optic nerve\u2014the cable connecting the eye and the brain, composed of 1.2 million fibers, each representing a different pixel point on the brain's vision map. \"It turns out that there are obvious and not-so- obvious diseases of the optic nerve,\" Dr. Sadun explains. \"The optic nerve can suffer any disease the brain can\u2014such as tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis\u2014but there are also diseases that affect the optic nerve specifically, which is what I find to be the most compelling.\" Intriguingly, these conditions almost all involve injury in one way or another to mitochondria\u2014 the powerhouse of cells. \"In these dis - eases, if the mitochondria become sick, the canary in the coal mine is the optic nerve,\" Dr. Sadun says.Exploring the Optic Nerve Stein/Doheny Research Group Leads the Way in Neuro-Ophthalmology Clinical Trials Dr. Sadun is especially interested in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, a disease that affects only the genes of the mitochondria and can cause sudden and permanent blindness, usually among individuals in their teens or 20s. The genetics for Leber's are simple\u2014when the mother has a genetic defect in her mitochondria, it will always be passed down to her children; Leber's cannot be passed by the father. \"The genetic defect is necessary but not sufficient for blind - ness,\" Dr. Sadun notes. \"Something else triggers the disease and makes carriers go blind, suddenly and dramatically.\" Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is extremely rare\u2014so rare, in fact, that Dr. Sadun sees many of the patients from throughout the United States who are suspected of having the disease. But the central involvement of mitochondria in the disease also makes it of consider - able interest as it becomes increasingly apparent that mitochondria are import - ant in other, more common conditions. These include vision diseases such as macular degeneration and glaucoma, as well as neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. With three decades of experience determining the natural history of a pure mitochondrial disease, Dr. Sadun's group has emerged as a focal point for clinical trials of optic nerve conditions such as Leber's that could also prove effective in treating the more common conditions. Of the six ongoing clinical trials headed by the UCLA Department of Ophthalmol - ogy team, four involve Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy; the other two are for patients who experience a type of stroke of the optic nerve, properly termed acute nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neu - ropathy (NAION), in which a loss of blood flow to the nerve causes sudden vision loss in one eye. Three of the trials for Leber's use gene therapy\u2014injecting a virus that delivers a \"good\" version of Medical visualization showing an overhead view of the human head. The optic nerve, which connects the eyes to the brain, is highlighted in blue. 70 UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | Research and Fundingthe mutated gene into the inner layer of the eye, where the cells that give birth to the optic nerve reside. The fourth Leb - er's-related study is the latest in a series of trials Dr. Sadun has led using small molecules\u2014in this case, in the form of a topical ophthalmic solution\u2014designed to allow the affected cells to compensate for the genetic error. As recently as 15 years ago, there were no neuro-ophthalmology clinical trials in the United States, Dr. Sadun notes, because of the perceived small size of the market for neuro-ophthalmologic drugs. That was before it became apparent that because the optic nerve is part of the brain, clinical trials involving diseases of the optic nerve could serve as testing grounds for more complex neurological diseases that affect far more people. Dr. Sadun made that point early in his career with a study he published in the mid-1980s showing that the optic nerve is also damaged in Alzheimer's disease. \"The reason I chose that approach was that I figured one quick measurement of visual function such as color vision was substantially easier than subjecting peo - ple to a few days of psychometric exam - inations,\" Dr. Sadun explains. \"We have much better ways of measuring signs and symptoms for the eye.\" Ever since, he has consistently made the case that the accessibility of the optic nerve\u2014through both vision testing and the ability to image the eye as a transpar - ent organ\u2014renders it a powerful model for gaining insight into a host of neurolog - ical diseases. \"There is much less 'noise' in studies of the optic nerve than there would be for something like Alzheimer's disease, where there are so many vari - ations that could potential influence the results,\" Dr. Sadun says. \"Any disease of the brain also affects the optic nerve, but whereas the brain is diffuse, compli - cated, and hard to measure, in the optic nerve these diseases are very precise. We know the starting point is 1.2 million fibers, we know their size and location, and any damage can be assessed accu - rately through a variety of tests. In addi - tion, when we have a patient complaining of a black spot or blurred vision, that's much more specific than when an Alz - heimer's patient complains of not being able to think right.\" Using the optic nerve as a model for neurological studies, results in less \"noise,\" which means it takes fewer patients to prove the efficacy of a treat - ment, Dr. Sadun notes. The hope is that once that proof of principle is established for patients with optic nerve conditions, the same therapy could be tested in patients with the more common neuro - logical diseases, using the already estab - lished information about dosing and side effects. That potential to benefit large numbers of patients is what makes the neuro-ophthalmology research at the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology of such great interest to the pharmaceuti - cal industry.\"The optic nerve can suffer any disease the brain can\u2014such as tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis\u2014but there are also diseases that affect the optic nerve specifically, which is what I find to be the most compelling.\" ALFREDO A.

Research and Funding | UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE 99 100 UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | Research and FundingAbout the Institute About the Institute Established in 1966, the UCLA Stein Eye Institute vision-science campus is the fulfillment of a dream\u2014an ambitious plan developed by Jules Stein, MD , to prevent blindness by transforming the quality of vision research, education, patient care, and community outreach. The Institute exists because of Dr. Stein, one of the most influential executives in entertainment who returned to his roots as a medical doctor to become a national advocate for vision science; and Bradley R. Straatsma, MD, JD , founding director of the Stein Eye Institute and founding chair of the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology, who created a bold plan for building the scope of ophthalmology in the UCLA School of Medicine. Together Drs. Stein and Straatsma ensured the Institute would take a central role in transforming vision science as a powerful platform for discovery and patient care to eradicate one of the great scourges of human existence: blindness. Under the leadership of Bartly J. Mondino, MD , director and chair since 1994, the Institute's core pillars have been increasingly developed and a broad agenda of program-building and expansion has been implemented. The original dream for ophthalmology at UCLA has evolved into the Institute's bold transformation to a vision-science campus\u2014an interconnected community of facilities and people that merge research, training for new ophthalmologists, premier patient care, community outreach programs, and ongoing education for doctors worldwide. A historic partnership\u2014a first of its kind\u2014was forged with the Doheny Eye Institute in 2013, creating the nation's preeminent organization for ophthalmic care and vision research under the banner of the UCLA Department of Ophthalmology. And today, patients across the Southland have access to the finest vision care at the Stein Eye Institute in Westwood; the UCLA Stein Eye Centers in Calabasas and Santa Monica; the Doheny Eye Centers UCLA in Arcadia, Orange County, and Pasadena; and UCLA-affiliated hospitals in Sylmar, Torrance, and West Los Angeles/Sepulveda. Since its opening on November 3, 1966, the Institute's original mandate remains paramount: the relentless drive for excellence and the constant search for new pos - sibilities in the treatment of the eye. The Institute's decades of accomplishments may have even exceeded the original soaring expectations of Dr. Stein who at the dedication ceremony defined his own prophecy for the Institute and the medical field he loved: \"The men and women who will occupy this building and use its resources will share in future achievements that will outstrip any that have been seen; for science today is moving ahead with fantastic speed, and we must be sure that eye research moves with it. The history of this Institute begins with this dedication. I am confident that it will be a proud history.\" 102 UCLA STEIN EYE INSTITUTE | About the InstituteDoris and Jules Stein The legacy of Dr. and Mrs. Jules Stein arises from their role in the 20th cen - tury as visionaries. Through brilliance and beneficence, they created a multi - tude of programs aimed specifically at one goal: preserving and restoring eyesight. They approached this task dauntlessly, integrating the worlds of business, medicine, and philanthropy in such a way as to enhance each and leave in trust the promise of limitless accomplishment in the advancement of eye research and treatment. The Stein Eye Institute was established as a result of their philanthropy.\"If I am remembered for anything, it will not be for anything I did in show business, but for what I did to prevent blindness.\" DR.

This noble undertaking has been due in large part to a strong tradition of philanthropy from private sources. Contributions from individuals, foundations, and corporations help underwrite priority needs, which uphold scientific innovation, patient care, training and education, and a strong commitment to community engagement. The Institute offers a variety of giving options to those who wish to promote and participate in this tradition of excellence. Ways to Give Direct Gifts Direct gifts\u2014whether by cash, check, or credit card\u2014are critically important to Stein Eye because the gifts can be put to work immediately, increasing their impact and extending their reach. Endowments A gift of an endowment demonstrates a long-term commitment, since the fund is maintained in perpetuity. A por - tion of the annual investment income is used to support clinical, educa - tional, and scientific initiatives and the remaining investment yield is returned to principal, thus, over the years, the fund can grow and provide continu- ous support. An endowment serves as an endur - ing legacy as it can bear the donor's name or honor a loved one. Giving opportunities exist for endowed chairs, endowed fellowships, and endowed funds for research, education, and patient care. These funds can be made payable for up to five years. Pledges A pledge is a formal statement of intention to make a gift. Donors who seek to defer the bulk of their giving until a future date, or who want to give via installments over time, may use this giving strategy. A pledge may be followed by an immediate gift or may simply confirm your intention to make a gift in the future. Pledges are typically made in concert with a preliminary first installment and provide a source of consistent and dependable funding. This method often allows donors to give more generously than they may have originally considered.Securities Gifts of appreciated securities are tax deductible at their full market value. In most cases, appreciation in the value of the security benefits the University and is not taxable to the donor. Matching Gifts Many corporations have demonstrated their support by matching or multiply - ing their employees' gifts up to a set amount. Before making a gift, you may want to ask whether your employer participates in a matching gift program. Certain restrictions apply to matching gifts. Please consult your company's personnel office. Real Estate Real estate (your primary residence, vacation home, commercial property, or land) is an asset that you can lever - age in a variety of ways to support the Institute while reducing taxes and elim - inating the burden of maintaining or selling your property. You can also use real estate to fund gifts that provide you with an income stream for life.Bequests Making a gift through your will or living trust gives you the immediate satisfac - tion of creating a lasting and personal legacy that ensures Stein Eye's future and costs nothing now. Charitable Gift Annuity In exchange for a gift of cash or appre - ciated securities, you can receive fixed income for life and an immediate char - itable income tax deduction. In addi - tion, a portion of the annuity payments is tax-free. Qualified Retirement Plans Naming The UCLA Foundation as a beneficiary of some or all of your quali - fied retirement plan may help you min - imize taxes and maximize your philan - thropic impact, while leaving to your loved ones, assets that are less taxed. Tribute Gifts Contributions may be made in mem - ory, honor, or celebration of a loved one, or to commemorate a special occasion. Donations can be used for unrestricted program support or be directed to any area of the Institute. Your Gift Can Make a Difference However you choose to support the Institute, you will be embarking on a partnership with one of the world's preeminent eye research centers. Such an investment will greatly expand our understanding of the causes of eye diseases, expose alternative treatment options, and ultimately prevent blindness.
