Chiropractic manipulation (also known as chiropractic adjustment or spinal manipulation, is a common therapeutic treatment for low back pain. The objective of this [chiropractic treatment](https://orlandokissimmeechiropractor.com/treatment-options) is to reduce the subluxation, which results in an increased range of motion, reduced nerve irritability and improved function. Myofascial Release Focuses on trigger points by applying pressure at the proper degree and intervals resulting in relief of strained muscles and eliminating or reducing muscle spasms. A normal muscle has muscle tone. Accidents, injuries and other forms of trauma may cause too many impulses to fire into the spinal cord producing hypertonus or acute muscle spasm. If this situation exists for a sufficient time, it can change the position of bones, producing subluxations, body distortions, low hips, etc. A trigger point may later form in the muscle which sends a barrage of painful impulses into an area producing constriction of the blood vessels with consequent damage to surrounding tissues. Stretching / Exercise Instruction Stretching and Exercise Instruction is the art of identifying your bodies physical limitations, and developing stretching and exercise programs to help address and improve ones general health and range of motion. Improved range of motion and providing your muscles essential stimulation often leads to improving the quality of ones life from a physical perspective. Intersegmental Traction Intersegmental traction gently helps reestablish the normal and natural ranges of the body's [spine](https://orlandokissimmeechiropractor.com/spinal-conditions/). Intersegmental traction tables also help facilitate muscle relaxation and reduce muscle spasms. It has been shown that professional intersegmental traction treatments greatly accelerates recovery progress from certain types of [back injuries](https://orlandokissimmeechiropractor.com/personal-injury-chiropractic-care/).

Electric Muscle Stimulation Also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) or electromyostimulation, is the elicitation of muscle contraction using electric impulses. The impulses are generated by a device and delivered through electrodes on the skin in direct proximity to the muscles to be stimulated. The impulses mimic the action potential coming from the central nervous system, causing the muscles to contract. The electrodes are generally pads that adhere to the skin. EMS is both a form of electrotherapy and of muscle training. Hot/Cold Therapy Heat and ice are the two most common types of passive, non-invasive, and non-addictive therapies. Heat and cold can be used alternatively and are often used as a prelude to exercise therapy. Heat therapy induces vasodilation: drawing blood into the target tissues. Increased blood flow delivers needed oxygen and nutrients, and removes cell wastes. The warmth decreases muscle spasm, relaxes tense muscles, relieves pain, and can increase range of motion. Cold therapy produces vasoconstriction, which slows circulation reducing inflammation, muscle spasm, and pain. "}
