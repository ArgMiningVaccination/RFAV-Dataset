Mr. Speak- er, I ask unanimous consent that dur- ing the consideration of H.R. 2099 pur- suant to the provisions of House Reso- lution 201, the Chairman of the Com- mittee of the Whole may postpone until a time during further consider- ation in the Committee of the Whole a request for a recorded vote on any amendment, and that the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole may re- duce to not less than 5 minutes the time for voting by electronic device on any postponed question that imme- diately follows another vote by elec- tronic device without intervening busi- ness, provided that the time for voting by electronic device on the first in any series of questions shall not be less than 15 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I would mention that we have a gap in time today of 2 hours between 2 and 4 when Members want to go to the Korean Memorial ceremonies. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen- tleman from California? Mr. STOKES. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I would like to get further clarification with respect to rolling the amendments. If we can agree that not more than three or four would be rolled at a time, I do not think there would be any problem at all from our side. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speak- er, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STOKES. Further reserving the right to object, I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speak- er, there is no problem with that on this side at all. I expect that we may have a series of amendments, five or six or seven, some of which will not re- quest votes, and if there are three or four, I think that is very workable. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Speaker, I with- draw my reservation of objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen- tleman from California? Mr. MINETA. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Speaker, I would like to in- quire of the gentleman from California. A number of us who are Korean war veterans would like to be going down to the dedication of the Korean War Veterans Memorial dedication. There was some thought that maybe between the hours of 2 and 4 that there may be some opportunity so that some of us may be able to get away for the dedication of the Korean War Veterans Memorial. I would hope that we would be able to cluster some of those votes outside that 2 to 4. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speak- er, will the gentleman yield? Mr. MINETA. I yield to the gen- tleman from California.Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Speak- er, I thank the gentleman for raising the question. We mentioned it earlier. It is very important that Members know that we will be trying to struc- ture votes so that there will be free time between 2 and 4 for the Korean Memorial ceremony. Mr. MINETA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reserva- tion of objection. The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gen- tleman from California? There was no objection. /fdash GENERAL LEAVE Mr. LEWIS of California.

Pursu- ant to House Resolution 201 and rule XXIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the consider- ation of the bill, H.R. 2099. /ballot1211 IN THE COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE Accordingly the House resolved itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for the con- sideration of the bill (H.R. 2099) mak- ing appropriations for the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, commis- sions, corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes, with Mr. C OM- BEST in the chair. The Clerk read the title of the bill. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered as having been read the first time. Under the rule, the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] and the gen- tleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] will each be recognized for 30 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS]. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, colleagues, I am pleased to present H.R. 2099\u00d0the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appro- priations bill for fiscal 1996. Let me get right to the bottom line. This bill, as it now stands, provides $60.045 in discre- tionary budget authority and $19.361billion for mandatory accounts. This represents an overall reduction of $10.006 billion\u00d0or minus 14.3 percent\u00d0 in domestic discretionary authority from last year's levels. It is $10.482 bil- lion less than President Clinton re- quested for the 22 agencies, boards, and commissions that fall within the sub- committee's jurisdiction. Following directly from our recent success in the rescissions package, this bill represents the urgent need to put Uncle Sam on a diet. We are doing what many said could never be done. We are making the tough decisions re- quired to balance the Federal budget in 7 years. The bill reflects real cuts in each and every agency, except the VA's medical care account. These cuts, in this bill, at this time, are absolutely required if we are to keep our commit- ment to the American people regarding changing the way their Government in Washington operates with their hard earned tax dollars. We do not have the luxury of postponing these decisions to the outyears. We have tightened Uncle Sam's belt a notch or two, but this is the beginning, not the end, of identify- ing real savings. At this point, I want to move away from the numbers for just a moment in order to share a few observations about the many people who have made it pos- sible for the subcommittee to bring this bill to the floor today. I know that you will understand when I say this\u00d0 the chairmanship of the VA\u00b1HUD sub- committee is not a lonely job. The Members should know how fortunate I feel to be working so directly with Mr. STOKES of Ohio who chaired the sub- committee in the 103d Congress. Mr. S TOKES is much more than a friend. Time and again, he has been someone on whom I can absolutely count when it comes to understanding the impact of the fundamental changes which we are making. The gentleman from Ohio never stops listening or working with me regardless of how much he may disagree with the sub- stance of any matter under negotia- tion. And we appreciate the help we get from his able staff\u00d0particularly Leslie Atkinson and Del Davis. Throughout our hearings this year as the subcommittee developed the bill, I encountered reactions ranging from amazement to amusement among our subcommittee's 11 other members. But I have always known that I could count on each and every one of those mem- bers to work with me to improve the direction, substance, and purpose of this bill. Indeed, it is a very special privilege to work on such a close basis with all who serve on the VA\u00b1HUD sub- committee. To a person, they are men and women of uncommon intelligence and conviction. This bill reflects their bipartisan participation and coopera- tion. Last, I want to say how much I value and appreciate the work of the staff. With the exception of Paul Thomson who has long worked with us on appro- priations matters, ours is a brand newCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7821 July 27, 1995 partnership. The work of the staff\u00d0be- ginning with our staff director Frank Cushing and including Jon Gauthier, Tim Peterson, and Todd Weber has been first rate. Their attention to de- tail has been nothing short of essential and I just want each and every one of them to know of our appreciation. In keeping with the Speaker's guid- ance, the subcommittee has made every effort to work with all of the committees of jurisdiction that author- ize the various programs affected by this bill. Though there will be continu- ing controversy over the numerous housing and environmental administra- tive provisions contained in this bill, the membership should know that we have worked diligently at both the member and staff level to develop the language with the knowledge and ex- pertise of the various chairs in the Commerce, Transportation and Infra- structure, Veterans, Banking, Judici- ary, Science, and Agriculture Commit- tees. When we have completed general de- bate, I will offer an amendment that increases the total dollars already pro- vided for VA medical care, VA health professional scholarships, special needs housing, homeless assistance, and FHA multifamily credit subsidies. This amendment culminates the prolonged negotiations which we have had with our leadership and many of our author- izing partners. I share their desire to see much less legislation in this bill next year and I hope the coalitions which we have formed in working to- gether this year will be lasting ones. Let me move now to summarizing just a few of the many difficult choices and positive highlights that make up this complex piece of legislation. DIFFICULT CHOICES Four agencies are terminated for a savings of $703 million in discretionary authority from 1995 enacted levels: The Corporation for National and Commu- nity Service, Community Development Financial Institutions, the Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board, and the Council on Environ- mental Quality. It's possible that we may get an amendment contemplating the elimination of yet another\u00d0the Se- lective Service System. The bill does not provide requested funding for the construction of two ad- ditional VA hospitals in Florida and California which would have resulted in major construction costs of $343.2 million this year. We hope to continue working with Members from the af- fected regions to provide state of the art outpatient facilities that are con- sistent with the direction that Veter- ans Secretary Jesse Brown suggested last year when the VA was participat- ing in the national health care reform debate. NASA, too, will make a major con- tribution to deficit reduction. Their budget has been reduced by $705 million from last year's level. And we have gone much farther than I think Admin- istrator Goldin would be comfortablewith. This bill begins the process of re- ducing the size of NASA's plate. It makes real and painful program changes which will reduce fiscal year 1996 and outyear pressures. Two major NASA programs, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility and EOS will be substantially altered in order to help reduce the pressures on the overall bill. This bill provides $4.88 billion for the EPA\u00d0a reduction of $2.4 billion or 33 percent from the fiscal year 1995 level. Frankly, our bill is an urgent plea to Administrator Browner. If you believe that Superfund is broken, help us fix it. If you believe that command and con- trol is the wrong approach, act now to make EPA a facilitator of progressive environmental policy rather than an enforcer of excessive and inflexible Federal mandates. If you believe that EPA should base decisions on proven sound science, risk assessment, and thorough cost-benefit analysis, by all means join with us in perfecting this bill. The EPA is a regulatory agency com- pletely out of control, an agency that until now has delighted in routinely re- defining its mission without proper congressonal oversight. The legislative provisions in this bill reflect the need and desire to restore some common sense and flexibility to the challenges of environmental protection in our country. The EPA should be a facilitator of progressive environ- mental policy rather than an enforcer of excessive and inflexible Federal mandates. With regard to Superfund, I under- stand that my colleague from Ohio, Mr. OXLEY , the chairman of the authorizing Commerce Subcommittee, is set to move a reauthorization bill this fall. It is my hope that Administrator Browner will work with the authoriz- ing committee in addressing the dif- ficulties of this task. The issuance and funding of new records of decision [RODS] by potentially responsible par- ties is one area that should be analyzed during the reauthorization process. EMPHASIZING THE POSITIVES The subcommittee has provided a funding level of $38.1 billion for the De- partment of Veterans Affairs. The VA stands alone among the agencies in our jurisdiction. It's funding is not signifi- cantly reduced. Every requested dollar for mandatory spending is provided. If my conforming amendment is adopted in a few moments, an increase of $562 million will be provided for medical care\u00d0over and above last year's fund- ing level of $16.2 billion. We have also taken great care to pro- vide every available dollar for the basic research mission of the National Science Foundation. NSF would re- ceive $3.1 billion in this bill\u00d0a reduc- tion of 6.5 percent or $200 million from last year's level. The subcommittee's overall funding level for HUD, if my manager's amend- ment is adopted, would be $19.4 billion. The mark recognizes that two of HUD's largest and most cost effective pro-grams\u00d0community development block grants\u00d0$4.6 billion\u00d0and the home in- vestments partnership program\u00d0$1.4 billion\u00d0are working largely as in- tended. Neither program will absorb re- duction's from last year's level. The subcommittee has been mindful of the guidance from those who receive HUD dollars\u00d0nonprofits, local public housing authorities, and resident groups\u00d0that reductions in their fund- ing should not proceed this year absent substantial legislative reform that maximizes flexibility in how they ad- minister Federal housing dollars. And, even though HUD's comprehensive re- form bill is far from final action in the authorizing process, we have provided $862 million for a section 8 replacement assistance fund. In all of these matters, I have had the privilege of working with Mr. LAZIO\u00d0the chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Housing. He has re- minded me more than once that there is great need for thoughtfulness when one wields the machete. Numbers drive policy. Policy drives perception. And before we know it, we can have real change in the broken delivery mecha- nism that we all know as HUD. The section 8 replacement assistance funds will provide for nearly 77,000 units of tenant based housing, thus al- lowing the Secretary to proceed with two of his most important initiatives\u00d0 tearing down the worst of the low va- cancy high rises in public housing and targeting assistance to individuals rather than properties. These vouchers will be available to anyone who loses their unit if these long overdue changes are undertaken by the Sec- retary. No one will be thrown out on the street and many of the individuals who could receive assistance under this fund will be in decent housing for the first time in years. Mr. Speaker, these are the challenges and highlights presented with the fis- cal year 1996 VA, HUD, and independ- ent agencies appropriations bill. I hope that the members will see fit to accept the difficult tradeoffs reflected here. I urge you to support the bill when we get to final passage. /ballot1215 Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposi- tion to H.R. 2099, the fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill for Veterans Af- fairs, Housing and Urban Development, and independent agencies. As a member of this subcommittee for more than 20 years, it is a difficult position for me today to stand here in opposition to this measure. Let me first acknowledge and recog- nize the work and leadership of our chairman and colleague from Califor- nia, J ERRY LEWIS. No one knows better than I, having previously served as chairman of this subcommittee, the complexities of this bill. As it stands, we must provide funding for criticalCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7822 July 27, 1995 veterans, housing, environmental, science, and research and development programs. The increasing Federal defi- cit and call for Government reform has heightened the problems of meeting these essential needs. So Chairman LEWIS' task has not been an easy one. Nonetheless, within the allocation that this subcommittee received, we have considerable opportunity to try and meet the basic and pressing prior- ities upon which veterans, the elderly, and low-income and working Ameri- cans depend. Unfortunately, instead, the subcommittee launches a wholesale assault on these individuals and those critical programs that provide safety net and human service programs, not to mention programs that are designed to ensure a safer and cleaner environ- ment for our children and our commu- nities. Now we have heard our colleagues on the other side represent this bill as fair, given the adverse allocation of the subcommittee. But I don't think that our veterans, our elderly, our children, and our poor would agree. In fact, the President does not agree and has al- ready indicated that he will veto this bill if it is presented to him in its present form. In his statement on H.R. 2099, the President says and I quote: The fiscal year 1996 VA/HUD appropria- tions bill passed by the House Appropria- tions Committee is unacceptable. I call on the Congress to correct the appropriations bills now under consideration before they reach my desk, not after. Let me take a moment to explain to you why this bill is so unacceptable to the President and those of us who care about people. For our veterans, this bill reduces by nearly $1 billion the level of spending that the President has requested for veterans including medical care, gen- eral expenses, and construction projects. These cuts seem especially callous. Certainly, individuals who have given the ultimate sacrifice and risked their lives for our collective safety and well being deserve to have the full level of security for themselves and their families to live out the rest of their lives. In a letter circulated yesterday to all Members of the House James J. Kenney, executive director of AMVETS stated: The designated appropriations still falls well short of the funding necessary to even maintain the current level of earned entitle- ments for our veterans. Further he says: The proposed budget will require painful decisions on the elimination of critical serv- ices. The bill falls short in the areas of medical care\u00d0almost $200 million below the President's budget request, in construction\u00d0where critical facili- ties are needed for a growing and aging veterans population, in benefits servic- ing\u00d0where a cut to the VA Benefits Administration would impact the first line of support veterans receive when they approach the VA through the vo-cational rehabilitation counselling and the veterans services divisions. This bill, once again, targets housing programs as we saw earlier this year in the rescissions bill. On top of the $7 bil- lion taken from HUD in the 1995 rescis- sions, this measure cuts $5.3 billion from the President's request. The se- verity of the reductions are appalling enough seeing that $4.2 billion of the cuts to HUD came from housing pro- grams alone. Hardest hit are those pro- grams that provide affordable and de- cent housing for the elderly and poor, like section 8 incremental rental as- sistance and public housing operating and modernization funds. But our colleagues on the other side did not stop here. Added to these crushing reductions are pages of exten- sive legislation that is tantamount to repealing the statutory goal of decent, safe, and sanitary housing for all Americans. Minimum rents are set and residents who only average $8,000 a year in income are forced to pay more in terms of their rent contributions. At a time when affordable housing is at a record short supply, this bill would not only gut affordable and low-income housing but cut homeless assistance grants by $400 million. Secretary Henry Cisneros has stated that while the com- mittee sees savings in these actions, he sees a terrible pain for the most eco- nomically vulnerable working people. Several colleagues and I will be offer- ing amendments to try and correct these harmful actions. When they finished with destroying our investment in public and low-in- come housing, our colleagues decided to set back this Nation's efforts to en- sure that each American breathe clean air, drink clean water, and be safe from hazardous waste dangers. This devasta- tion is accomplished through a cut in funding to programs like the Superfund Program, the Safe Drinking Water Re- volving Fund, the Clean Water State Revolving Fund, and EPA operating programs. The public health is further jeopardized by the nearly 20 limita- tions and riders that further these per- nicious acts. I will be offering, with my colleague on the other side, Congress- man S HERRY BOEHLERT , an amendment to strike these riders from the bill. The list of egregious actions in H.R. 2099 unfortunately continues. The Cor- poration for National and Community Service [AmeriCorps] and the Commu- nity Development Financial Institu- tions Program are terminated. The bill also calls for the close out of the Coun- cil on Environmental Quality within the Executive Office of the President. Our Nation's critical investment in science and technology has also been reduced through the 5-percent cut in NASA and the 6-percent cut in the Na- tional Science Foundation. The reductions in this bill are severe and reason enough for not supporting this legislation. What is even worse is that the cuts are being made in part to finance a tax break for the most wealthy. These actions are penny wiseand pound foolish and I therefore strongly oppose this bill. /ballot1230 Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from Michigan [Mr. KNOLLENBERG ], a member of the com- mittee. Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the bill. I would like to begin by commending the gentleman from California, Chair- man L EWIS, for all of his hard work. Shepherding an appropriations bill through the legislative process is no easy task, yet he has done it with skill and flair. I would also like to thank the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. And finally, we all owe a debt of grat- itude to the subcommittee staff\u00d0 Frank Cushing, Paul Thomson, Tim Peterson, John Gauthier and Todd Weber. We truly would not be here today if it weren't for their tireless ef- forts. Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill. It does not simply spread the pain throughout all of the programs in its jurisdiction, it makes the tough choices necessary to move up toward a balanced budget. Overall, it cuts about $10 billion in spending from last year's level. But it also preserves funding for programs which work well and are im- portant to the Nation's future. Now, we are going to hear a lot of heated rhetoric about disproportionate cuts in housing programs. But do not let that get in the way of the facts. Yes, next year housing programs will have to absorb some spending reduc- tions\u00d0there is no doubt about it. But when compared to the other agencies in this bill, HUD's funding ac- tually will take up a larger share of the outlays than they did this year. In short, HUD will enjoy a slightly larger piece of a smaller pie. And in the present budgetary environment, that is nothing to complain about. Mr. Chairman, there is a lot of good in this bill. VA medical care has been protected, as has funding for univer- sity-based scientific research. We pre- serve funding for NASA's core mis- sions; and we send EPA a strong mes- sage that they must move away from their current Soviet-style, command and control system of regulation. I am sure that every Member of this body, given the chance, would draft a VA\u00b1HUD bill that is different from the legislation before us. But, to use an often-heard quote, we can't let the per- fect be the enemy of the good. Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from Texas [Mr. G ONZALEZ ], the ranking minority member of the Com- mittee on Banking and Financial Serv- ices.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7823 July 27, 1995 (Mr. GONZALEZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, I join my colleagues in expressing my strong opposition to the mean spirited and draconian HUD\u00b1VA appropriations bill for fiscal year 1996. If this bill is enacted, we are signaling almost a full retreat by the Federal Government as a critical partner in affordable housing and community revitalization. H.R. 2099 slashes one-quarter of the budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. It neither ex- pands, nor preserves, nor rehabilitates public and assisted housing and then requires poor families to pay more for deteriorating housing, or go homeless. I find it ironic that on Monday the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities released its new study, ``In Short Sup- ply: The Growing Affordable Housing Gap,'' which determined that the num- ber of low-income renters exceeded the number of affordable rental units by 4.7 million low-income renters. This Na- tion has lost 43 percent of its affordable housing supply, some 2.2 million hous- ing units, over the last two decades, ac- cording to the study. If we pass this appropriations bill, we virtually ensure that affordable hous- ing will continue to decrease and dete- riorate; we will lose our $90 billion in- vestment in public housing; and hun- dreds of thousands more families will become or remain homeless. Despite what our colleagues on the majority and on the Appropriations Committee contend, these are not hard decisions, they are heartless. Public housing residents in the more than 3,400 local housing authorities throughout the Nation are at risk of seeing their everyday maintenance re- quests go unanswered for lack of oper- ating subsidies. This appropriations bill funds operating subsidies at only $2.5 billion, some $400 million below this year's funding and only 85 percent of what housing authorities need to op- erate their housing authorities. And the eyesores of deteriorated and dilapidated housing in many of our urban centers will remain vacant and crumbling, further destroying neigh- borhoods because nearly one-third of the modernization funds and all of the urban revitalization grants for severely distressed public housing projects will be lost if this bill passes. There will be no new public housing funded and no new section 8 certifi- cates available for the first time in 20 years even though there are more than 5.6 million families today who pay more than 50 percent of their incomes for rent, or who live in substandard housing. There are more than 1.5 mil- lion families on public housing and sec- tion 8 waiting lists throughout this country. The number of families who are homeless or who pay exorbitant rents or who live in terrible housing conditions grows each year by more than 10 times the number of new fami- lies that would be assisted under theappropriation bills for 1996. During this fiscal year 88,400 units of affordable housing were financed through the var- ious Federal housing programs\u00d0next year fewer than 15,000 units. Frail elderly residents of public and assisted housing will not receive criti- cal supportive services like personal care, transportation, and congregate dining, hastening the entry into expen- sive nursing homes and destroying the elderly's dignity and independence. Why? Because this bill provides no funding for the Congregate Housing Services Program. The bill also elimi- nates funding for the drug elimination grant program which has been so help- ful to so many in fighting crime and providing residents a sense of safety and security. The bill leaves two of the core pro- grams untouched\u00d0HOME and CDBG. That is good; however, do not be sur- prised if a year from now or sooner, the mayors and the Governors are here begging for more money. Because, the deep, deep cuts in public housing and section 8, and the increases in the cost of that housing inevitably will mean trouble for our cities and States\u00d0more deteriorated housing and more home- lessness\u00d0more people with nowhere safe and sound to live. While it may seem that there are a myriad of dis- crete programs, in truth Federal hous- ing programs are interrelated, serving different needs and segments of our low- and moderate-income families. When one program is underfunded, it places pressure on all the other pro- grams. What this bill does, make no mistake, is place the burden on cities and States, while the Federal Govern- ment takes a walk and abrogates its responsibilities. I know it has become fashionable to bash the Department of Housing and Urban Development and to blame the poor, the victims, for their troubles. But slashing funding for the very pro- grams that provide for one of the most basic needs\u00d0housing\u00d0is simply inex- cusable. HUD has taken a budget hit dis- proportionate to any other agency, ex- cept perhaps the EPA. And through the appropriations bill, housing policy\u00d0 which I might add, should be under the purview of the Banking Committee\u00d0 has shifted and changed course dra- matically, without the benefit of hear- ings or analysis\u00d0all to get to the bot- tom line. So the Republicans will make the fundamental problems of a lack of affordable and decent housing and via- ble communities worse. I have watched these programs work for poor and working families, for the elderly and for the disabled throughout my public career. One of my jobs in my home city of San Antonio before I came to Congress was with the San An- tonio Housing Authority. Then public housing worked as it continues to in many communities today. And now with one simple action, the Republican majority will devastate the lives of families currently residing in publicand assisted housing and those who wait, sometimes for years, for such housing. The Republicans talk about their his- toric budget resolution, their vaunted balanced budget. But their bold insist- ence and desire to provide foolhardy tax breaks for the wealthy at the ex- pense of America's poor and working families drives this process. That is the thrust of this massive and mean as- sault on our most vulnerable citizens. Mr. Chairman, I include the execu- tive summary of the study referred to in my remarks for the R ECORD , as fol- lows: INSHORT SUPPLY : THEGROWING AFFORDABLE HOUSING GAP I. SUMMARY New national housing data show that the shortage of affordable housing for low-in- come renters is now wider than at any point on record. This gap\u00d04.7 million units\u00d0has grown consistently in recent decades because the number of low-rent units has fallen while the number of low-income families has grown. As a result of these trends, four of five poor renter households with incomes below the federal poverty line face housing costs that exceed 30 percent of their income, the federal housing affordability standard set in 1981. More than three of five poor rent- ers spend at least half their income on rent and utilities. The Affordable Housing Shortage Data from the 1993 American Housing Sur- vey, which is sponsored by the U.S. Depart- ment of Housing and Urban Development and conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census, indicate that a substantial shortage of af- fordable housing has developed in recent dec- ades. In 1970, the first year for which comparable data are available, there were 7.4 million low-cost rental units. That was roughly 900,000 greater than the number of low-in- come renters, which stood at 6.5 million. (Low-income renters are defined here as those with incomes of $12,000 or less in 1993 dollars, or roughly equal to the poverty line for a family of three. Low-cost units are those with rent and utility costs totaling less than 30 percent of a $12,000 annual in- come, or less than $300 a month.) By 1993 this situation had reversed. The number of low-rent units fell to 6.5 million while the number of low-income renters rose to 11.2 million\u00d0resulting in a shortage of 4.7 million affordable units. This is the largest shortage on record. There are nearly two low-income renters for every low-rent unit. The affordable housing squeeze means that many poor renters spend very large propor- tions of their income on housing. The new AHS data show that: Some 82 percent of poor renter house- holds\u00d05.7 million households\u00d0spent more than 30 percent of their income on rent and utilities in 1993. Some 4.1 million poor renter households\u00d0 or three of every five poor renters\u00d0spent at least half of their income on housing. These households are considered by HUD to have ``worst case'' housing needs and are given priority for housing assistance under federal law. The typical or median poor renter spent 60 percent of income on housing in 1993. These housing affordability problems are nationwide, affecting poor households in every region of the country and both urban and rural areas. They are not limited to ra- cial or ethnic minorities, and poor families with one or more workers are nearly as like- ly as those relying on public assistance to have very high housing cost burdens.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7824 July 27, 1995 1Due to data limitations, the regional gap figures refer to occupied low-cost units only, while the na- tional gap figure accounts for all low-cost units, in- cluding those that are vacant.The shortage of affordable housing is one million or more rental units in every Census region\u00d0Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The widest affordable housing gaps, when measured as the number of low-income renters competing for each occupied low-rent unit, are in the West and Northeast.1 Some 83 percent of poor renter households in central cities spent at least 30 percent of income on housing in 1993, as did 87 percent of poor renters in suburban areas and 74 per- cent of poor renters in nonmetro areas. The problems of high housing cost burdens affect poor white, black, and Hispanic house- holds alike, with more than four of five poor renters in each group spending at least 30 percent of income on housing. Similar pro- portions of both elderly and non-elderly poor renters had housing cost burdens this high, as did both working poor families with chil- dren and poor families without a worker. The Role of Housing Assistance The growing affordability problem reflects both an increase in poverty\u00d0and thus in the number of low-income renters\u00d0and a sharp decline in the supply of low-cost housing in the private market. In 1973, the first year for which such data are available, there were 5.1 million unsubsidized units with costs of $300 a month or less, as measured in 1993 dollars. By 1993, this number had fallen to 2.9 million units, a decline of 43 percent. To help offset these trends, a significant portion of funds appropriated for housing programs since the early 1970s has been used to expand the supply of subsidized housing. While this has led to an increase in the num- ber of low-income families receiving housing assistance, the number of new housing com- mitments dropped markedly in the 1980s, even as the affordable housing gap was wid- ening. Between fiscal years 1977 and 1980, HUD made commitments to expand rental assist- ance to an average of 290,000 additional low- income households each year. From fiscal year 1981 through fiscal year 1995, new rental housing commitments fell nearly three-fourths to an average of 74,000 per year. In addition, two other federal hous- ing programs\u00d0the HOME program created in 1990 and the Low Income Housing Tax Credit created in 1986\u00d0provide funds that allow state and local governments and private or- ganizations to produce housing. Neverthe- less, these programs are likely to add only modestly to the supply of housing affordable to the poorest renters since the programs generally are not targeted to very low-in- come households with severe housing prob- lems. If the number of additional commitments made since 1981 had remained at the level of the late-1970s, over three million more low- income renters would be receiving housing assistance today and the affordable housing gap would not be so wide. Altogether, the relatively large expansion of federal housing assistance in the 1970s and more modest expansion in the 1980s resulted in an increase of 2.3 million in the number of families receiving housing assistance. This expansion was roughly equal to the decline in the number of low-cost units in the pri- vate market but failed to match the large in- crease in the number of low-income renters over this period. The overall result was a net loss in the proportion of low-income renters able to find affordable units and a substan- tial widening of the affordable housing gap. Most poor renters remain without housing aid. In 1993, some 37 percent of poor renterhouseholds received a housing subsidy from the federal, state, or local government. The limited level of housing assistance means that most poor families seeking housing as- sistance are placed on waiting lists and usu- ally wait several years before receiving aid. In 1993, some 1.4 million households were on waiting lists for housing subsidies for pri- vately owned housing, and 900,000 households were on waiting lists for public housing. The Impact of Congressional Proposals To Cut Housing Programs The trends highlighted in this analysis\u00d0a declining supply of low-cost rental housing in the private market and a growing number of low-income renters\u00d0indicate that unless the number of families receiving government housing assistance increases each year, the affordable housing gap will grow wider. Con- gress, however, is considering large cuts in funding for federal low-income housing pro- grams. These reductions are likely to end the longstanding practice of modestly adding to the supply of subsidized housing each year and would likely lead to a reduction in the number of low-income families receiving as- sistance. The cuts being considered would have an adverse effect on the supply of low-cost hous- ing. Reductions in operating and moderniza- tion assistance for public housing included in the House appropriations bill for HUD would likely lead to an increase in the number of vacant public housing units, since public housing authorities would face difficulty maintaining current units and repairing di- lapidated units. The bill also would reduce funding for homeless assistance by nearly half, while suspending the requirement that available subsidies be targeted on households with severe housing problems that are most at risk of becoming homeless. In addition, the bill's elimination of efforts to expand the subsidized housing stock while the number of low-rent unsubsidized units continues to fall would widen the affordable housing gap. This can be seen by calculating what would have happened had such policies been in effect in the recent past. If no additional families had received housing assistance between 1973 and 1993, the shortage of affordable housing would have reached nearly 6.9 million units in 1993, rather than 4.7 million. The proposed reductions in low-income housing programs also would tighten the fi- nancial squeeze on many households with very low incomes. Some of the federal sav- ings would come from raising rents on nearly all tenants of subsidized housing, with the greatest increases falling on the poorest ten- ants. Poor renters not receiving housing as- sistance also could experience rent increases; if the number of unsubsidized low-cost units continues to fall while the subsidized hous- ing stock is stagnant or begins to shrink, there will be more low-income renters com- peting for fewer low-rent units. The laws of supply and demand suggest this could push rents upward for many unsubsidized low-rent units. Furthermore, both poor renters who receive housing assistance and those who do not are likely to face greater difficulty in meeting higher rental costs as a result of re- ductions in other federal programs that as- sist low-income families and individuals. Ex- pected reductions in AFDC, SSI, food stamps, Medicaid, and the Earned Income Tax Credit will limit the ability of many families to pay rent and meet other neces- sities. The combined effect of these develop- ments is likely to be pressure for more poor families to ``double up'' and an increase in the number of families at risk of becoming homeless. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from New Jersey [Mr.FRELINGHUYSEN ], a member of the com- mittee. (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN asked and was given permission to revise and ex- tend his remarks.) Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair- man, I thank the gentleman for yield- ing me the time. I rise in support of this bill. Mr. Chairman, as a new member of this subcommittee I want to thank Chairman L EWIS, Congressman S TOKES , and the subcommittee staff for their leadership and guidance during this long process. Our bill contains funding for many vital programs for our Nation's veter- ans, to protect and preserve our envi- ronment, to help house the needy and disabled, and for scientific research and discovery. It has been a difficult task balancing these needs and funding all of the pro- grams. I believe that we have achieved this. In total, our bill provides $79.4 bil- lion for these programs. Mr. Chairman, this is $10.5 billion less than last year and $10.5 billion below the President's budget request. Like the other appropriations bills that have passed the House this year, this bill moves the country closer to- ward the goal of a balanced budget. While I do not agree with all the reduc- tions in this bill, I do believe it is time to stop throwing good money after bad and start refocusing our limited re- sources toward programs that work. Since subcommittee markup, I have been contacted by many people who merely look at the bottom line or the appropriated level for each agencies that are contained in this bill. I would suggest to these people that they begin to look at the programs contained in this bill and ask the question are these programs working? In many cases they are not. For example, both Secretary Cisneros and the President agree that the De- partment of Housing and Urban Devel- opment [HUD] needs to be reformed. In fact, it is the Secretary's own sugges- tion that many programs should be eliminated and the entire department should be reduced down to three um- brella programs. I am hopeful that the authorization committee on housing will soon adopt a housing bill that will reform HUD and put it back on track. This message is also targeted toward the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA]. Simply sitting back and extend- ing current law, like Superfund, is an abdication of their leadership. Its time to come to the table and be a full part- ner toward reform. EPA's Adminis- trator has said the program is broken and this bill recognizes that fact. The bill provides adequate funding to keep the program moving, however, it stops the expansion of the program until the law is reauthorized. The last reauthor- ization was done in 1986. In reviewing EPA's budget, I have found that the Superfund situation is not an isolated case, but a rule of thumb for many of EPA's programs.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7825 July 27, 1995 Yes, environmental laws have worked, however, laws need to be updated and reformed and the status quo is not ac- ceptable. In many cases the bureau- crats have decided arbitrarily to overstep their legal authority and push policies that are clearly beyond statu- tory intent. Distracted by regulation and litigation, EPA has lost their focus on the bottom line\u00d0protecting our re- sources and addressing critical envi- ronmental needs. In my State of New Jersey, both housing and environmental programs are extremely important. That is why I am pleased to have worked with the chairman to provide additional re- sources for section 202 and 811\u00d0two housing programs that do work to help our older Americans and people with disabilities. This issue will be ad- dressed in the chairman's amendment and I thank him for his support of these programs. This bill also funds the Department of Veterans Affairs. Nearly half of the bill's funding supports these activities and I am pleased that the committee was able to increase medical care above this year's level by nearly $500 million. In addition we have been able to fully fund the compensations and pensions programs, veterans' insur- ance, and the Loan Guarantee Pro- gram. This bill is not the perfect answer to all the problems that we face, however, it is the first step in a process that will bring us toward a compromise. Mr. Chairman, I support this bill and I urge my colleagues to adopt this measure. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle- woman from Washington [Ms. D UNN]. Ms. DUNN of Washington. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise as a strong sup- porter of the space station and urge my colleagues to continue funding for this valuable space and science mission. When I first came to Congress in 1993, I became a member of the Science Committee and the Space Subcommit- tee. During the 103d Congress, we lived through the highs and the lows of this program. There was a call for the project to be redesigned, and space sta- tion funding passed on the House floor by one single vote. In early 1994, NASA made significant changes in the way it conducted busi- ness. They streamlined the program. For the first time, they named a single overall prime contractor for the space station, and they brought proven pri- vate sector know-how, decision-mak- ing, and competitiveness into the pro- gram. Russia joined our international part- nership, a partnership that already in- cluded Japan, Canada, and member countries of the European Space Agen- cy. This provided us the opportunity to use selected Russian hardware, to learn from their experience in extended space flight, and to use the MIR space station for testing and training pur-poses. We all witnessed the successful results of this partnership earlier this month with the MIR docking. The new, redesigned station, with Boeing as the prime contractor, forced NASA to trim costs and develop a pro- gram that was both fiscally and sci- entifically sound. The space station budget has been capped at $2.1 billion annually. This is not an open-ended ob- ligation, Mr. Chairman. We will reach completion in 2002. In 1994, continued funding for the sta- tion passed overwhelmingly, highlight- ing the success and bipartisan support for this program. Mr. Chairman, with the station, we will promote international cooperation and the peaceful exploration of space. We will spawn new industries, new products and new jobs. We will give rise to unprecedented research capa- bilities, and we will provide incentives to our students to pursue scientific professions if America remains dedi- cated to preserving its scientific cut- ting edge. Since we began the race for space in the 1950's, this Nation has taken upon itself the role of leader, not only in space exploration but also in space- based research. For my colleagues who are looking for a down-to-earth, practical reason to support this station, here is one for you: your mother, your daughter, your sister, or your wife. Because of the unique microgravity environment the station provides for research, new and exciting approaches to diagnosing and treating breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and osteoporosis are being investigated in space labs in ways that simply are not possible on Earth. In fact, Mr. Chairman, as a result of an amendment that I worked on that set aside funding specifically for wom- en's health care research, for the first time on the recent MIR mission female rats were used to study the relation- ship of long-term space existence on the development of osteoporosis. Bio- medical research on Earth, working hand-in-hand with space-based re- search, will help eradicate this terrible disease that affects our mothers. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. O BEY], the ranking minority member of the Com- mittee on Appropriations. Mr. OBEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding the time. Mr. Chairman, I simply want to say that some of the cuts in this bill are obviously acceptable in the interest of deficit reduction. But the problem with this bill is that it simply goes too far. It makes what I consider to be savage cuts in housing. It contains a wholesale assault on our ability to protect public health and to protect clean water and clean air and our natural resources, and it contains unnecessary reductions in veterans' health care, all to free up more money in this grand scheme toprovide significant tax reduction for people who make $200,000 a year or more. I do not believe that is right. I would urge at the end of the day after we have had at it on the amendments that unless this bill is improved markedly, and I do not think it can be\u00d0I think it is beyond help almost\u00d0I would urge you to vote against it. I have great respect for the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], he is a good friend of mine, but I do not see any reason why we ought to use this vehicle to really crunch in a seri- ous way our ability to protect public health from toxic chemicals. If you take a look at this bill, fully one-third of this bill, which is supposed to be simply a budget bill, contains il- legitimate legislative language that prevents the Government from enforc- ing the law to protect the health of workers, to protect the right of neigh- borhoods to know what kind of toxic chemicals are being infused into the atmosphere, to protect the public's right to drink safe clean water, and it engages in all kinds of Rube Goldberg operations in the veterans' health care area in order to squeeze out yet more money for tax cuts for the rich. This is not a fair bill. It is not a de- cent bill. It ought to be defeated. /ballot1245 Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ], ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Oppor- tunity. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gen- tleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], my good friend who has done yeoman's work on trying to protect the poor and the vulnerable and the working people and our senior citizens in this bill. Mr. Chairman, the trouble is we just do not have the votes to protect the people that the Republican majority wants to cut in order to provide a tre- mendous tax break to the richest and most powerful interests in this coun- try, and at the same time, pump more and more funds into the defense bill. It would be one thing if all of these bills were looked at with any kind of sensibility, but what we have seen is a $7.6 billion increase in the defense bill alone as it pertains to equipment pur- chases. We are buying B\u00b12's that the Navy and Air Force say they do not need. We are buying F\u00b122's that they say they do not need. The Navy says it really does not need this new sub- marine, but we are buying that any- way. But, Mr. Chairman, when it comes to housing, we are going to go out and get public housing, raise rents on our sen- ior citizens, and turn around and say that we are going to try to protect the homeless by cutting the homeless pro- gram in this country by 50 percent. When all sorts of Cain was raised about that, the Republicans are goingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7826 July 27, 1995 to come back in and say they are going to put another $1 million back into the homeless program after 7 years, but they are going to take the money out of assisted housing in order to fund the homeless program. We are going to create more home- lessness and put the money back into homelessness. This is one of the most half-cocked, hair-brained schemes I have ever seen. The authorizing com- mittee ought to have had hearings; made decisions about whether or not we ought to put funds into the section 8 program, versus public housing, ver- sus assisted housing. There are good decisions that could be made and we do not have one of them that is located in this bill. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York [Mr. F LAKE ], the ranking minor- ity member on the Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy. (Mr. FLAKE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to H.R. 2099. Mr. Chairman, I think all of us real- ize that these cuts are targeted to the most vulnerable people in our popu- lation, those persons who are in the greatest need, those persons who can- not stand the lethal blow that this par- ticular bill makes available for them. Mr. Chairman, it is the highlight of arrogance, in my opinion, that we dev- astate possibilities for community re- vitalization, that we take those per- sons who are in need of government support as it relates to section 8 rental assistance and that we reduce the amount available to them, while at the same time raising the amount of rent that they will have to pay. Mr. Chairman, the height of hypoc- risy is reflected in the fact that on this day we unveil a memorial for the Ko- rean War veterans, while at the same time are cutting millions of dollars from the veterans' programs. As a nation, we cannot afford to con- tinue to allow people to live in sub- standard housing, allow people to live at a standard that is not qualitative, so that all of our people understand that they have a place in this great democ- racy of ours. Mr. Chairman, where is our compas- sion? If we are compassionate, we will vote this bill down. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle- woman from Nevada [Mrs. V UCANO - VICH] , a member of the subcommittee. Mrs. VUCANOVICH. Mr. Chairman, when I refer to H.R. 2099 in one word that word is ``commitment.'' Congress has made a commitment to the people of our Nation to balance the budget and this bill takes a large step in that direction\u00d0providing more than $10 bil- lion in deficit reduction. Yes, Uncle Sam can be put on a diet and the Ap- propriations Committee is his personal trainer.But Congress also committed itself to end duplication of programs and eliminate the never-ending source of redtape. This bill eliminates outlived bureaucracies and consolidates several programs, with the President's bless- ing, in an effort to improve services such as better housing for those who need assistance. Last, the bill fulfills our Nation's commitment to veterans. Our veteran's health is of utmost importance. That is why the VA medical care account was the only account in the bill not to re- ceive a reduction. Assuming that the chairman's upcoming amendment is approved\u00d0and I urge my colleagues to support it\u00d0the VA medical care ac- count will increase by $562 million more than last year's funding level. But that is not all. The bill provides in- creases over fiscal year 1995 funding for compensation and pensions, readjust- ment benefits for education and train- ing, and veterans insurance. The bill also provides funding for medical re- search, the National Cemetery System, and State veterans' cemeteries, among other essential programs for veterans. As a member of the VA\u00b1HUD Appro- priations Subcommittee, I can tell you that this was not an easy bill to draft\u00d0 and I thank and applaud the chairman and his staff for their dedication to this task. But it is a bill that makes priorities and fulfills our commitment to the people of this Nation to spend their money wisely. That is a promise made and a promise kept by this bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Cali- fornia [Ms. W ATERS ], a member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Commu- nity Opportunity. Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill. It is fundamen- tally flawed. It would ravage commu- nities, uproot families, and disrupt the lives of thousands of Americans. We must reform public housing, but Re- publicans have gone about it entirely wrong. This bill would increase rents paid by residents recieving section 8 vouchers from 30 to 32 percent of adjusted in- come. The average voucher family has a yearly income just under $8,000. This increase would have the affect of tak- ing away $140 per year from these fami- lies. It would also decresae the work in- centive for able-bodied adults. It would zero out community devel- opment banks, a bi-partisan programs which generates private-sector eco- nomic development. This bill reduces housing for seniors, for the sick, and for the needy. It legis- lates a series of changes which would greatly inhibit our ability to house Americans, expand opoprtunities, and develop economically. It is extreme and it should be defeated. I urge defeat of this bill. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Cali-fornia [Ms. R OYBAL -ALLARD ], a member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity. Ms. ROYBAL-ALLARD. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in opposition to this bill. Mr. Chairman, the cuts contained in the Republican VA\u00b1HUD appropria- tions bill are devastating for working American families. For example, the community development financial in- stitution fund, which helps commu- nities and individuals empower them- selves, will be defunded. The CDFI fund was created because residents and entrepreneurs from low and moderate income communities un- fairly experience barriers in obtaining credit. Many do not qualify for loans to pur- chase a home or start a business be- cause they lack conventional credit histories. As a result, individuals and communities cannot achieve economic prosperity and self-reliance. CDFI fund resources leverage private sector funds and provide assistance and training to community development fi- nancial institutions. The CDFI fund is a powerful tool that creates jobs, restores hope, and pro- vides a better way of life for those de- siring a piece of the American dream. Only last year the CDFI received the near unanimous support of Democrats and Republicans. Vote ``no'' on the VA\u00b1 HUD appropriations bill. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mary- land [Mr. H OYER ]. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I want to talk specifically about cuts in this bill which concern me greatly; cuts to the Mission to Planet Earth, a critical NASA program. The President re- quested $1.34 billion. This bill, unfortu- nately, includes only $1 billion. That is a lot of money, but it is a very signifi- cant reduction from the request and from the level adopted by the Commit- tee on Science this week. The committee, on Tuesday, reported a bill that authorizes $1.27 billion for Mission to Planet Earth. This is $272 million above the reported appropria- tion amount. Mr. Chairman, we should restore that money, if the allocation to this appro- priation measure was not so con- strained. I understand the problem of the gentleman from California [Mr. LEWIS] and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] with respect to the funds available, but this program is a critical program for the future, not only of the space program, but for the future of the ability of those of us on Earth to understand better our environment and our weather. Mr. Chairman, I would hope that the committee would see fit to increasing this sum as this bill moves through. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Mary- land [Mr. W YNN]. Mr. WYNN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.R. 2099. It represents a political meat ax, rather than a responsibleCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7827 July 27, 1995 carving knife, as we approach the budg- et process. Mr. Chairman, there is a 23-percent cut in housing programs, representing more than $5 billion; representing the elimination of personal programs such as section 8, which helps disadvantaged people get housing, and HOPE home- ownership grants that allow people to pursue the American dream. This bill represents a 46-percent cut in housing for the elderly. How some Members could say we are helping the elderly is beyond me. The elderly will pay between an average of 400 and 600 additional dollars per year for senior housing. Mr. Chairman, this bill represents a 54-percent cut for low-income assisted housing programs, the working poor of our country, and a 49-percent cut in homeless programs, which means that more Americans will be living in card- board boxes and laying out along the street side. Critically, it represents a 48-percent cut in construction and improvement in veterans' facilities, which means our Nation's veterans will continue to see inadequate treatment and work in in- adequate facilities. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from New York [Ms. V ELA\u00c2ZQUEZ] . (Ms. VEL A\u00c2ZQUEZ asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Ms. VEL A\u00c2ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today out of a sense of deep sad- ness and outrage. Yet again, the major- ity brings before this body an attack on children, the elderly, and the poor. The cuts in this bill are criminal. Funding for low-income housing is slashed by $7 billion. Homeless assist- ance; public and assisted housing; housing for the elderly, the disabled, and AIDS victims; and the FHA multi- family insurance program all suffer steep rollbacks. Many others, such as the Drug Elimination Program, are eliminated altogether. These cuts, Mr. Chairman, aren't about numbers\u00d0 they're about human beings. There's a human tragedy behind every dollar of these reductions. On any given night last winter, there were 600,000 men, women, and some- times children living on the streets. This bill's $540 million cut in the McKinney program would mean that hundreds of thousands more will join them this winter. I urge my colleagues to vote no on H.R. 2099. There is too much pain behind this bill. A $700 million cut in public housing operating subsidies, and a $2.3 billion reduction in the public housing capital budget isn't an abstraction. These cuts mean delays in both basic maintenance and major repairs; less security serv- ices; and the elimination of essential social services. For 3 million public housing residents, the reductions translate into deteriorating buildings, greater insecurity, and fewer opportu- nities for economic advancement. Ending the Drug Elimination Pro- gram isn't about cutting wastefulpork-barrel projects. In New York City, the program funds 435 housing police officers who patrol the grounds and hallways of New York's public housing developments. These beat cops would be lost. This is only a partial list of the many tragedies that would result from this bill. At some point in this appropria- tions process, reasonable minds and compassionate hearts must prevail. I urge my colleagues to reach that point in this bill. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Min- nesota [Mr. V ENTO ], a member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Commu- nity Opportunity. (Mr. VENTO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I cer- tainly rise in opposition to this bill, be- cause it affects the people we rep- resent. Mr. Chairman, what do they want from us? What do they expect from this bill? They expect decent, affordable, sanitary shelter. They expect environ- mental justice. They expect us to try and respond to what their needs are. We obviously have a budget problem, that is dug deeper by the tax breaks that our Republican colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to want to advance and dig the hole deeper with our Federal budget deficit. We have to pull in the belt, but we do not have to do it on the basis of the poorest of the poor, the working people, or families. /ballot1300 They want shelter; they want a green environment. They want the same small good things of life. People want us to take the knowledge we have and use it to provide for their need and pro- tection. There are a lot of people walking around who have got their heads up in the stars. They want to look too and fund the space station. The votes are here for that. Frankly, to me, it is the alchemists project of the 20th century trying to do something of questionable value at the very same time we have got real seri- ous problems right here in our commu- nities. We have got to advance not just on defeating the budget deficit, the fis- cal deficit, but we have got to deal with the human deficit, what is hap- pening to people in our communities. Those that do not have the skills, that do not have the education, do not have the shelter, to give them the where- withal, those working people, so they can pull themselves up. We have got to be partners in this process, the Federal Government with the non-profits and others. We cannot walk away from the State and local governments that are depending on these housing and environmental pro- grams. They work. Let us not kill them. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this, appropriations legislation that devalues com-munities and families with slash-and-burn cuts in important programs at HUD and the EPA. While the VA, HUD, and independent agen- cies bill has essentially insulated important Veterans programs, and saved NASA's space station yet again, this bill has set in its sights the undermining of environmental law and policies and the gutting of basic housing and shelter needs of poor American citizens. These housing cuts measuring roughly 25 per- cent of the total and budget for 1995 and are all the more dangerous in light of the recently approved rescission bill for fiscal year 1995 that took over $6 billion from HUD. The underlying bill basically halves the funds available for HUD's homeless programs: assuring that approximately 130,000 fewer homeless Americans will be served this com- ing fiscal year. These are not just numbers, they affect real people families. They are the lives that won't recover from homelessness by moving into transitional or permanent housing, to jobs and self-sufficiency. Talk about a fiscal deficit must also consider the human deficit. The Minnesota communities of St. Paul, Min- neapolis, Hennepin County, and St. Louis County, that could receive over $13 million in fiscal year 1996 for homeless assistance, would likely see $6.5 million less for providing key services and intervention to do just that. Furthermore, the Federal Emergency Man- agement Agency's Emergency Food and Shel- ter Program for the homeless is reduced 23 percent by this bill. This highly successful pro- gram that partners with the major national charities will find that it will be able to serve almost 24 million fewer meals, provide close to 1 million fewer nights of shelter for individ- uals and families, and give homeless preven- tion assistance through emergency mortgage- rent-utilities payments in close to 200,000 in- stances in the next fiscal year because of this bill. To add salt to the budget cut wounds, this appropriations bill will cut public housing mod- ernization funds and operating subsidies funds, forcing an increase in vacant unit, a re- duction in maintenance and less spending on necessary security and social services. These cuts will mean almost $19 million less for housing authorities in Minnesota alone. The underlying bill then ironically asks low-income families, who do not have income to spare, to kick in more of their meager funds through minimum rents, a repeal of the decades old Brooke amendment that limits the percentage of their income spent on rent, and through the inclusion of utilities payments which of course is a significant cost in extreme climate areas such as Minnesota. All of this, without one hearing on the implications of these policy changes in our Housing and Community Op- portunities Subcommittee at the Banking Com- mittee. This bill eliminates the Congregate Housing Services Program. It combines elderly, dis- abled and HIV/AIDS housing programs into one program and then cuts their funds 46 per- cent. It wipes out the successful Public Hous- ing Drug Elimination Program. This program, which I tried to expand last year, often pro- vides the extra support necessary for public housing authorities [PHA's] and their residents to make a difference in their lives. For exam- ple, in St. Paul Public Housing, this program is being used to offer a STEP Program: Sup- port for Training and Employment Program. STEP provides job training with individualizedCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7828 July 27, 1995 case management. This particular program partners with the Minnesota Department of Education, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, and St. Paul Public Schools. This appropriation bill further reneges on de- cent, safe, affordable housing for all Ameri- cans by eliminating funding for new incremen- tal section 8 rental assistance. This move will resign the millions on waiting lists today to an certain terminal wait in substandard housing or our Nation's streets. The VA, HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill continues the assault on un- derserved communities by killing AmeriCorps, the FDIC Affordable Housing Fund, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund. The CDFI fund that was created in late 1994 to provide a national network of financial institutions dedicated to community develop- ment. It was bipartisanly supported at that time\u00d0and, even in the recent 1995 rescis- sions bill assured that the CDFI would have $50 million as it streamlined and reduced the administrative costs of the program. This program is unique providing capital support for CDFI's to use to leverage or to provide incentives for more traditional thrifts and banks to increase community investment and lending. This Clinton initiative is about de- veloping private markets in distressed commu- nities in order to create jobs, provide housing loans, construct affordable housing, and pro- vide other opportunities to help communities and individuals to help themselves through ac- cess to capital. The CDFI program should be funded. It has broad support from community groups and lending institutions alike. It is petty politics that sees it defunded today and I would hope that this Congress could rise above that and seek good policy instead. In a year of relentless attacks on decades of environmental policies and laws, the Appro- priations Committee budget plan for the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency [EPA] sets a new standard for outrageousness. The VA, HUD and Independent Agencies Appropria- tions bill for fiscal year 1996 cuts EPA's oper- ating budget by one third and enforcement budget by 50 percent. The legislation prevents EPA from enforcing central parts of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and other major environmental programs. Because of these proposed radical cuts, the bill would reduce the ability of the EPA to re- spond to threats to the environment and human health. In the long run, this approach will mean more water pollution, more smog, more food poisoning, more toxic waste spills, and eventually, more taxpayer dollars spent to solve these problems. It is particularly egregious to use the budget process to eliminate critical programs that pro- tect public health and the environment\u00d0the Appropriations Committee should not be pro- hibiting any agencies from enforcing Federal law. If Congress intends to repeal or roll back environmental protection statutes, these changes should be debated out in the open. The American people will not stand for this give away to polluters behind closed doors. Mr. Chairman, as I have stated, I have so very many concerns regarding this bill that I must certainly and will oppose it. This bill is full of authorizing language that reflect policy changes that have not been reviewed by the Committees of jurisdiction much less the pub- lic. This Congress has its priorities all wrong: Tax breaks for the rich, $2 billion in pie-in-the-sky funds for space stations our modern day alchemy, and giveaways for corporations who plunder our natural resources, while at the same time, eviscerating affordable housing, gutting environmental safeguards, and cutting funds for our most vulnerable citizens, the homeless. I do wish to be associated with supporting these ill-conceived attacks on our future and I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. W ALK- ER], chairman of the Committee on Science. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman, once again, I am pleased to rise in support of an appro- priations bill both because of its sub- stance and the process that molded it. Chairman L EWIS fully consulted with the Science Committee on programs under our jurisdiction. The result is a bill that closely tracks the NASA and NSF authorizations reported by the Science Committee over the past 2 months. H.R. 2099 starts the transition of NASA from an operational service agency to a premier research agency. Space science and human exploration are the priority as evidenced by full funding of such programs as the Cassini Saturn mission, Gravity Probe B, and the paramount space-based basic research laboratory known as Space Station Alpha. Revolutionary new efforts such as fundamental re- search in support of private sector de- velopment of fully reusable launch ve- hicles and small satellite and space- craft technology is also promoted. NASA programs that continue the Government as a service provider are transitional to the private sector. These include the space shuttle and Mission to Planet Earth. American commercial interests can provide both space transportation services and envi- ronmental and planetary data much more efficiently and effectively than huge, inflexible Federal bureaucratic armies that too often lack creativity and incentive. The other shining jewel for science in the VA\u00b1HUD bill is NSF. Its basic uni- versity research grant funding is held virtually harmless at its current level. Not too many Federal missions can claim that fact. This appropriation fol- lows the Science Committee's lead in promoting the priority of basic re- search in the physical science direc- torates. So, all in all, Mr. Chairman, this is a very good bill. It makes significant progress on deficit reduction while also setting wise priorities for the future knowledge base of the Nation. I thank and commend Chairman L EWIS for ac- commodating the Science Committee's policy goals. I strongly support the bill. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ], a member of the Sub-committee on VA, HUD and Independ- ent Agencies of the Committee on Ap- propriations. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Sadly, I rise in opposition to this bill, which we have worked so very hard on. Let me say for the record that I voted for almost every balanced budget amendment that passed this House and maintain a voting record that proves that. This bill is truly too severe. It cuts housing in our country by over 23 per- cent. It means seniors living in build- ings across this country will be paying $1,000 more a year even though they make $8,000 a year. It means our may- ors will have to choose between home- less, where funds are being cut by half, and drug elimination programs, and I think that EPA's cut of 33 percent, when we have got dumps and leaking dumps all over this country and toxic waste that we have to clean up is real- ly wrong. I think the President had a 2-percent cut in this budget. I think that was reasonable. This budget is too extreme, too sever, and in addition to that, if you read the provisions in the report, it even tries to undermine EPA's abil- ity to enforce environmental standards along our border as a result of NAFTA. It is even undermining environ- mental enforcement. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this meas- ure. Mr. Chairman, sadly, I rise in opposition to this bill. It is too extreme, at the same time too severe. I want to commend the distinguished chairman of our committee, the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], for his cordial han- dling of this very complicated bill and to ex- press my sincere appreciation for his efforts in restoring $10 million of funding to the Depart- ment of Veterans Affairs' Health Professional Scholarship Program by transferring funds from other accounts. I also want to acknowl- edge the diligence an wise counsel of the ranking minority member, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES], on this bill. Let me point out, I voted for the budget amendments that passed this House and maintain a voting record that proves it. But this bill is not even-handed\u00d0it cuts environmental protection by one-third; it cuts housing and senior housing by 25 percent, and it cuts med- ical care by $250 million at times when our World War II veterans are using the system in greater numbers. INTRODUCTION The programs under our committee's juris- diction provide assistance and benefits that help millions of Americans achieve a better life. Included are programs for medical care and benefits for our Nation's veterans, afford- able and decent housing for families and indi- viduals of all incomes and circumstances, a safe and clean environment, and investments in technology and science. Rather than cutting these budgets by a rea- sonable amount\u00d0say 2 to 5 percent\u00d0it axes support for key national commitments. The overall effect of the bill before this body is to seriously erode our efforts for veterans, hous- ing, and the environment. This bill provides in- adequate support for our Nation's veterans,CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7829 July 27, 1995 and it will impair our ability to provide them quality medical care. It also makes deep cuts in the funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u00d025 percent\u00d0and the Environmental Protection Agency\u00d032 per- cent. In addition, this bill continues to fund one very big-ticket item, the space station, at the expense of other programs under the commit- tee's jurisdiction, including ones designed to assist the poorest, the neediest, and the most vulnerable among us. I disagree with the se- verity of the reductions. And what makes it more egregious is that all the savings will not be used to balance the budget. Rather, the money is being controlled to give tax breaks to the Fortune 500 ``big daddies'' later this year. This is simply wrong. HEALTH PROFESSIONAL SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM Let me say, I am grateful to the chairman for his willingness to work with me to fund the Health Professional Scholarship Program. This educational and training program assists in as- suring an adequate supply of trained health professionals, not only for the VA but also the Nation. To date, these scholarship awards have provided more than 4,000 scholarships to students in nursing, occupational therapy, physical therapy, respiratory therapy, and nurse anesthesia. I thank the chairman for his strong willingness to cooperate and provide leadership on this health scholarship program which helps advance professionals during a time when tuition costs are skyrocketing. Upon graduation, students are required to complete 2 years of service in the VA health system, and the retention rate of the scholar- ship recipients in VA medical centers is great- er than 50 percent. The flexibility to provide scholarships for the education of a variety of health professionals has made this program particularly useful as changes have occurred in the delivery of health care services. As the program has identified shortages in particular categories of health professionals, the numbers and types of scholarship awards have been shifted ac- cordingly. For example, in fiscal year 1994, more awards were made for advanced prac- tice nurses, in contrast to entry-level nurses, and for physical therapists and occupational therapists. These are the health professionals currently in shortest supply in the VA, and they are anticipated to be needed nationwide in the future. This academic year, the program will be adding physician assistant awards to meet the needs of a health care system that is increasingly focusing on primary care. The funding of this program is vital to the recruitment and retention of scarce health pro- fessionals in the VA, and it is necessary to be responsive to the health care needs of veter- ans who have courageously defended this Na- tion. I thank the chairman for his strong lead- ership on this program. EAP/NAFTA REPORT LANGUAGE I also oppose this bill because it contains too much free rein with legislation on an ap- propriation bill. In addition, the report to this bill contains language which undermines our ability to en- force NAFTA. The report to the bill questions EPA's use of subpoenas to collect United States-Mexico border environmental data it in- fers EPA's issuing subpoenas to American companies with subsidiaries located in the vi- cinity of the New River and Imperial Valley in southern California, has somehow con- travened NAFTA. This language is just onemore example of the influence of big business lobbyists, and the extent to which the majority has subordinated the health and safety of our continent to pure greed. Everyone knows that the EPA is well within its authority in issuing these subpoenas. They were issued to U.S. companies, which are re- quired to comply with existing U.S. standards. The NAFTA contains provisions that protect our rights to determine and apply our own lev- els of environmental protection, and the Toxic Substances Control Act specifically authorizes the EPA to issue subpoenas as it did in this case. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle would be better served by listening to the Member of their own party who represents the district in question rather than the special in- terests and big business lobbyists who would use report language such as this in an attempt to intimidate the EPA into backing off of an in- vestigation which would have major health im- plications for our citizens. CONCLUSION As I outlined earlier during the debate on the rule, I also oppose this bill because it ze- roes out the effective drug elimination pro- gram. That has stemmed the drug tide across this Nation. Because of its elimination as well as the reductions in other vital programs that help veterans, the elderly, and children, I must oppose this bill and urge my colleagues to do the same. The bill is not balanced, and its savings will not help reduce deficit, but rather be transferred to billions in tax breaks to the privileged few. How sad. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. F AZIO]. Mr. FAZIO of California. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in opposition to the 1996 ap- propriations bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and independent agencies. The Republicans have once again adopted a paint-by-numbers strategy to reach their arbitrary deficit reduc- tion target and finance a tax break for wealthy special interests. How simple is their strategy? Re- markably simple. And remarkably cruel. Draw a line through those programs that help the poor, the needy, and the less fortunate. Slash your way across the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Veterans' Affairs, until you reach the Environmental Protection Agency. Once again, the Republican's have enacted wholesale change that will sig- nificantly decrease the quality of life for millions of Americans. The Republicans profess to have our long-term interests at stake, but their actions\u00d0in this case\u00d0speak loudly and clearly. This bill not only risks the health of our veterans, but the health and safety of all Americans. Unable to eliminate the EPA, my Re- publican colleagues have done their level best to cripple this agency and eviscerate programs that ensure every American has access to safe drinking water, clean air, and a toxic-free envi- ronment. Mr. Chairman, along the way, strike a crip- pling blow against housing programs that pro-vide affordable, safe, and decent housing for the elderly, the poor, and the sick. When you are painting by numbers, when your goal is driven by numbers, not by people, it is easy to pursue your goal with abandon. I would like to take this opportunity to re- mind my Republican colleagues that behind those numbers are real human beings, living real lives, and struggling to get by in tough times. A great number of the public housing units in this country are occupied by elderly women. And over a million of our children\u00d0of Ameri- ca's children\u00d0live in public housing units. For many of these kids, just about the only thing they can depend on, from day-to-day, is a place to go home to at night. This bill slashes public housing operating subsidies and modernization funds. The bill eliminates\u00d0obliterates\u00d0funding for severely distressed public housing and development, in addition to new housing vouchers and certifi- cates for the poor. If you are homeless, forget it. The Repub- licans have decided to paint you out of the picture, cutting homeless assistance grants by 50 percent. The Republican approach is really very sim- ple. They shake your hand and direct your at- tention to the magnificent prize behind curtain No. 3. When you turn your head, they reach around and pick your pocket. Hundreds of thousands of families who de- pend on section 8 assisted housing will get their pockets picked if this bill passes. At least 600,000 families in public and section 8 as- sisted housing will pay more every month in rent unless we reject this bill. While we debate these cuts, I urge my col- leagues to remember that this week marks particularly poignant moment. Today, we will dedicate a monument to the veterans of the Korean war. There are few Americans more deserving of our support than these veterans, and the vet- erans of our wars of the last half-century. Yet, the Republican bill cuts $250 million from veterans medical care and zeroes-out funding for a replacement VA hospital in north- ern California that was to service a veterans population of over 400,000 men and women. These cuts are unwise and break a promise that Congress made to northern California vet- erans 4 years ago. Without adequate support, the VA will sim- ply be unable to meet the increasing demand for health services as our veterans population ages. This bill cuts the EPA budget by one-third, hazardous waste cleanup programs by 30 per- cent, and funds for wastewater treatment fa- cilities by 25 percent. Perhaps most devastating is the legislative language in this bill that would prohibit the EPA from taking action to clean our environ- ment. These include restrictions on the EPA's ability to regulate sewer systems, wetlands, refineries, oil and gas manufacturing, radon in water, pesticides in processed food, lead paint, and water pollution. Some very important programs\u00d0such as the Sacramento River Pollutant Control Pro- gram\u00d0have been funded in this bill. With this funding, Sacramento County will be able to complete the process of identifying which pol- lutants exceed water quality standards.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7830 July 27, 1995 Once this is accomplished, the county can develop a feasible, cost-effective plan to ad- dress the problem of pollution in the Sac- ramento River. While this critical program has been funded, hundreds of others around the country have not. The Sacramento River Pollutant Control Program is a step in the right direction. But it does not begin to make up for the hundreds of steps back in this bill. All of us have been asked to make sac- rifices to help balance the Federal budget. We are prepared to make those sacrifices. But no one\u00d0not one American\u00d0should have to sac- rifice decent living conditions or a clean envi- ronment to finance a tax-break for Republican special interests. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Flor- ida [Mrs. M EEK]. (Mrs. MEEK of Florida asked and was given permission to revise and extend her remarks.) Mrs. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I have the utmost respect for the chairman of the subcommittee and the ranking member, but I do want to say to this House and to this country that to cut VA, HUD, and independent agen- cies as they have been cut in this bill is obscene, and it is not credible, and it does not show responsibility on the side of the Republicans' part of our House. I have served with them for 2 years, but I cannot believe that our good chairman on the Republican side would cut these housing programs and gut them for poor people. I want you to go with me for a mo- ment or two and realize that there are poor people who live in public housing whose water has sewage in it, whose housing is really, really depreciated to the point that they can not live in the housing. It makes just a mockery of poor people who need public housing. If government is any good to any- body, it should be good to poor people. You zero out funding to seriously dis- tressed public housing. I appeal to you to, please, redo some of the things in this bill. First of all, you need to kill this bill, because it deserves a respectable death. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. R OEMER ]. (Mr. ROEMER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. ROEMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] for yielding this time to me. Mr. Chairman, this bill is very big on the deficit and tiny on fairness. Certainly, we have to contribute and share the sacrifice in moving to a bal- anced budget by the year 2002. But we should be as concerned about the mil- lions of senior citizens in this country as we seem to be about housing for as- tronauts in space. Our priorities should not be just about four astronauts being housed in comfortable quarters but about being fair to millions of seniors and low-income people and not slash their budget by 23 percent.Let us make some of the tough choices around here and cut a B\u00b12 bomber or two that the Defense De- partment does not even want. Let us cut back on the CIA and the tobacco subsidies. Let us not decimate NASA and the space station. Other people have said the NASA budget is good. That is not true. Mis- sion to Planet Earth is cut by $338 mil- lion. Science, aeronautics, and tech- nology is cut by $313 million. Let us be fair in our efforts to move together in a bipartisan way to balance this budget. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. M INETA ], the ranking member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. (Mr. MINETA asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. MINETA. Mr. Chairman, this is a bad bill. Through targeted spending cuts, restrictive language, and legisla- tive riders, this bill is designed to as- sure less environmental protection and increased risk to the health and safety of our constituents. Without substan- tial changes, the House should reject this bill and allow the Appropriations Committee to develop a bill which is worthy of support. Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2099 reduces funding for the Environmental Protec- tion Agency by over one-third. This is unconscionable. While all agencies can use trimming of their budgets, we should be reviewing unsuccessful pro- grams for cuts. Instead, this bill inad- equately funds many of the programs which have proved to be highly suc- cessful\u00d0programs such as the Clean Water Act State revolving loan fund program. This is not cutting the fat, this is cutting the lean. It also inadequately funds the Superfund Program with the excuse that this is a transition year for that program. If this bill is part of a transi- tion, it is a transition to disaster. This bill makes the funding of assist- ance to States and local governments subject to reauthorization of the Clean Water Act. It creates a hostage of every constituent who is concerned about clean water. It would also cut off funding for the Superfund Program on December 31 of this year. It creates a hostage out of every constituent who cares about cleaning up toxic waste sites. Why does the bill contain these re- strictions? Unlike past years, this is not about the prerogatives of the au- thorizing committees under the rules of the House. No, the restrictions of H.R. 2099 are designed to put pressure on the Senate to adopt the House posi- tion on waivers, loopholes, and rollbacks for industrial polluters which were included in H.R. 961. That's right, the needs of State offi- cials for money to operate State pro- grams, the needs of cities to construct improvements in wastewater treat- ment, and the needs of the people forimproved water quality are all being put on hold so that industrial discharg- ers might have more leverage in con- vincing the Senate to accept waivers, loopholes, and rollbacks of the Clean Water Act. Throughout the clean water debate on this floor, proponents of the legisla- tion repeatedly argued that the States know best, and that the States must be allowed the maximum ability to con- trol water pollution decisions. But now, when it is time to actually indi- cate your support for cities and States, to literally put your money where your mouth is, the interests of State and local governments are being swept aside so that industrial polluters can have increased leverage in the Senate. Under H.R. 2099, States and local gov- ernments are held hostage in receiving $1.4 billion in grants to implement the Clean Water Act programs, even as cities and States continue to bear the burden of State and Federal require- ments to improve water quality. This bill is the mother of all unfunded man- dates. This is not what the cities and States want, and it is not what the citizens who we represent deserve. H.R. 2099 is an abuse of the legisla- tive process, and an abuse of the inter- ests of State and local governments. In Clean Water alone, the funding in H.R. 2099 is far below what is required, and far below the levels which the House approved just 2 months ago. The most recent estimate of needs generated by the States indicates that there are documented needs of over $130 billion over the next 20 years. At the funding levels of this bill, it will be impossible to ever fully capitalize the State revolving loan funds so as to meet these needs. Additionally, the House budget reso- lution assumed a funding level of $2.3 billion annually for the water infra- structure account. During consider- ation of the clean water amendments of 1995 in May, it was the opinion of the majority of the House that the funding authorization level should be reduced to match the budget resolution. I op- posed that amendment, and many of you joined with me. Now, even that re- duced funding level is cut in half. What we see is just one broken com- mitment after another to the cities and States. Promise the cities and States $3 billion to get support for gutting the Clean Water Act. When critics raise concerns about the bill, proponents ar- gued that H.R. 961 was a strong bill be- cause it provided $3 billion annually to the States. But then the House Budget Commit- tee developed a budget resolution which assumed spending of $2.3 billion annually. So the Republican leadership supports an amendment on the floor to reduce the authorization level to $2.3 billion to conform to the budget resolu- tion. Now, we are being asked to ap- prove a funding level one-half of the promise made just 2 short months ago. This sounds again like promises made, and promises broken.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7831 July 27, 1995 However, as objectionable as these funding levels are, this bill is totally unacceptable for the way in which it seeks to radically alter the implemen- tation of the Nation's environmental laws. In all my years in the House, I have never seen a more outrageous at- tempt to dismantle environmental pro- tection through the appropriations process. Changes to the Nation's environ- mental programs should be debated within the context of the proper com- mittees of jurisdiction. Instead what we have here is an attempt to gut the major environmental statutes by tuck- ing legislation in the back of an appro- priation bill at the last minute\u00d0legis- lation which would never survive pub- lic opinion if done in the open and through the normal process. Let's look at some of the more egre- gious provisions. Under this bill, EPA is prohibited from using any funds for the implemen- tation of the Great Lakes water qual- ity guidance, notwithstanding the enormous amount of work which States, local governments, private citi- zens, and EPA have put into the devel- opment of that guidance. This guidance was the subject of two separate amendments during markup of the clean water amendments of 1995 by the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Over the course of 2 days, a compromise was developed which was adopted by the committee. While the compromise clearly did not please all parties, it allowed the au- thorizing committee the opportunity to fully debate and consider the issue. In the end, the Transportation Com- mittee specifically approved the use of the guidance. This thoughtful and de- liberate process would be overturned should the provision in this bill re- stricting the use of funds remain. Another of the restrictions prohibits EPA from taking steps to stop raw sewage overflows regardless of the en- vironmental consequences of these overflows. These are the same over- flows which cause beach closures and prevent the consumption of shellfish. This is not an imaginary concern, and it is not without its economic con- sequences. In 1994 alone, polluted water caused at least 2,279 swimming advisories and beach closings. This re- sults in the loss of millions of dollars in tourist and recreational dollars, and thousands of lost jobs. This bill says that EPA cannot ad- dress the serious issue of stormwater pollution, even though it often rep- resents the major pollution problem in urban areas. This restriction would bar enforcement not only of municipal stormwater violations, but also of all industrial stormwater violations as well. While I have long supported changes to the municipal stormwater program to make it more responsive to environ- mental needs and the economic reali- ties of the cities, it is not the role of the Appropriations Committee to stopall efforts to address this serious prob- lem. Not even H.R. 961 did that. Yet, that is what we have here before us. EPA is prohibited from taking any action to implement or enforce the wetlands program. Clearly the Nation's wetlands program is in need of reform, but it is not in need of wholesale aban- donment. H.R. 2099 will allow illegal activities to proceed unabated, regard- less of the impacts on adjoining prop- erty owners since EPA will be power- less to assist in any enforcement ac- tivities. If this bill is enacted, up- stream property owners will be able to fill wetlands with no risk of EPA inter- ference. Upstream property owners will be able to contribute to flooding and water quality degradation downstream with no fear of enforcement of the law by EPA. This is not wetlands reform, this is an abandonment of the protec- tion which we all expect our Govern- ment to provide. The bill prohibits EPA from revising or issuing effluent limitations guide- lines and standards, pretreatment standards, or new source performance standards notwithstanding the need of industry, States and localities for up- dates of existing standards. Yet, it is these standards which the States use for the dramatic improvements in water quality which we will enjoy. If this language is enacted, there are two likely results\u00d0either all progress in improving water quality will stop, or States will have to go this route alone. I do not believe that American people want improvements to stop, and telling the States that they must develop standards and guidelines on their own is a very expensive proposition for the States. H.R. 2099 creates a new right to pol- lute the environment with no fear of repercussion. First, it reduces the en- forcement budget of EPA by nearly $130 million. Second, it creates an en- tirely unfounded and new defense to any enforcement action. No penalties may be sought against a polluter if the matter is subject to a State law provid- ing for a privilege for voluntary envi- ronmental audit reports. This may be the biggest ``Get Out of Jail Free'' card which ever existed. Under this language, a polluter would be able to escape any penalty for envi- ronmental violations, no matter how severe, if the polluter merely turns himself in. In addition, this language is written so broadly, that the admission need not be related to the pollution which is the subject of the enforcement action. If this language is taken to its extreme, it appears as though it is not even necessary that the State law pro- viding for immunity and the pollution need to have taken place in the same State. Imagine if you would, the ability for a polluter to escape responsibility merely by reporting the polluter's own wrongdoing, and even if the reported wrongdoing is unrelated to the envi- ronmental harm caused by the pollu- tion.H.R. 2099 also would permanently waive categorical pretreatment stand- ards for a single wastewater treatment plant in Kalamazoo, MI. Why this par- ticular plant, and why right now? There has been no public discourse over the merits of such a broad exemption. Yet, the appropriations process seems to be the place where all your concerns with environmental laws can be ad- dressed, and all environmental protec- tion abandoned. Mr. Chairman, the concerns I have just outlined are more than enough reason to oppose this bill. Unfortu- nately for the interests of our constitu- ents and the environment, I have bare- ly touched the surface. H.R. 2099 in- cludes many more riders and restric- tions on the ability of EPA to perform its responsibilities under the law and to fulfill the expectations of the gen- eral public. Many of these riders and restrictions favor specific industries or specific locations\u00d0industries such as oil, cement kiln, and pulp and paper, and locations such as Kalamazoo, MI, and the Kammer power generating sta- tion in West Virginia. Each of these special riders or re- strictions must be removed from the bill prior to House approval. That is why I intend to support the Stokes- Boehlert amendment to delete the rid- ers and restrictions. The waivers, loop- holes, and rollbacks which H.R. 2099 contains clearly make this an unac- ceptable bill. I urge defeat of H.R. 2099. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. W ELDON ]. No Member has been more diligent in representing his district and more cooperative with the committee than the gentleman from Florida [Mr. W ELDON ]. Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I thank the gentleman for yield- ing me this time. I commend the chair- man for the hard work that he has been doing. It must be made very clear to all Members that if we do not balance our budget, there will be no resources for important programs like that NASA, like VA, and like HUD. I support the chairman in the out- standing efforts in making sure that our manned space flight program is funded in this budget, particularly the space station. I do have some concerns about the provisions in this budget for VA medi- cal care in my district as well as some concerns about senior housing. I be- lieve that we will be able to address some of these issues in an upcoming amendment on this bill. However, I cannot overstate the im- portance that if we do not move toward a balanced budget, all of these crucial programs will no longer exist. I commend the chairman. I commend all the Republican Members as well as the Democrat Members on the other side of the aisle for working very hard to getting us toward that goal, that goal that has been so elusive for soCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7832 July 27, 1995 many years and years and years, up until this new Congress, of balancing our budget and moving our Nation to- ward a future of prosperity not only for the people alive today but as well for future generations that will not be in- heriting bankruptcy. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. J ACKSON -LEE]. Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today recognizing what we have to do regarding a sound fiscal policy. But I also rise to say that we must give hope to the homeless. We have some 600,000 individuals who are home- less at any given night, and these cuts specifically in Homeless Assistance would fall heaviest on the poorest Americans. A national sample found the average monthly household income among homeless persons was less than $200, regardless of household composi- tion. Mr. Chairman, I am asking we give hope to the homeless. I would like to see more money added. I hope I will be able to offer an amendment that adds an additional $25 million to the home- less so they will not be hopeless. I think the key issue is investment. Are we investing in people so that they can make a difference in their lives? I think the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act supportive housing [SHP] funds for the homeless have been utilized successfully and pro- ductively. It provides the homeless with an opportunity to be housed, but at the same time it provides the home- less families with support services. In addition to this program, housing for those living with AIDS is vital. My local government and community in Houston found that those individuals suffering with AIDS can live in dignity if we provide them with support serv- ices and good housing. We are here today to give hope, Mr. Chairman, and I hope we will give hope to the homeless by providing them the opportunities to make a difference in their lives. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. B ISHOP ]. Mr. BISHOP. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this appropriations bill, VA, HUD. Cuts go too deeply. They have cut housing, veterans, space, envi- ronmental programs, HUD cut 23 per- cent, deepest cuts against the homeless people, funds for the elderly and dis- abled cut in half, operating expenses for improving public housing cut, el- derly and low-income people soon to become homeless, EPA cut 33 percent, the Superfund toxic waste sites clean- up cut a third, the State revolving loan funds for sewage treatment plants cut in half, no funds for safe drinking water loan fund, veterans cut $1 bil- lion, almost, veterans medical care cut $250 million under request, VA admin- istrative costs and construction costs $500 million below requests, no new veterans hospitals, services to veterans who are now receiving it, 916,000 ofthem will be cut, the President's Na- tional Service Program cut. /ballot1315 Cuts, cuts, cuts, cuts. We need to do something better than this. We need to send this bill back. This appropriation is insufficient, and I urge my col- leagues to oppose it. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. O LVER ]. Mr. OLVER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] for yielding this time to me. I rise to oppose H.R. 2099. The Republican ma- jority finally has to reveal how they pay for $245 billion in tax cuts mostly for the wealthiest handful of Ameri- cans and who will get hurt. The hour of reckoning is here. Who gets hurt? Well, yesterday it was our neighborhoods which lost the certainty of security that more cops on the streets have given them. Today the victims of the Republican assault are the homeless and low-income families who lose billions in housing assistance. Today it is middle-class students who lose the opportunity to serve their country while paying for college. Today it is our cities and rural areas which lose millions in community de- velopment block grants. At a time when the majority is block-granting everything in sight, they choose to slash this effective, flexible block grant that was established 20 years ago by President Nixon. Today it is our en- vironment that takes a hit. Clean water, clean air, safe drinking water, the cleanup of hazardous waste; all are hurt by this bill. Mr. Chairman, these are just a few examples of the harm done in a bill that at the same time preserves fund- ing for the archaic Selective Service and gives billions to the space station. This bill typifies the Republicans' agenda: Slash funding for housing, edu- cation, training, and job creation for average Americans to finance tax cuts for the handful making over $100,000 a year. Vote against this bill. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ari- zona [Mr. S TUMP ]. (Mr. STUMP asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. STUMP. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. LEWIS] for the tremendous job he has done in crafting this bill. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the bill and want to compliment subcommittee Chair- man LEWISand Chairman L IVINGSTON of the full Appropriations Committee for their work on this measure. They have made some of the most difficult decisions to implement the budget resolution mandate to balance the Federal budget by the year 2002. The bill reduces virtually every agency under its jurisdiction below last year's spend- ing level except the VA.Compared to fiscal year 1995 spending lev- els, HUD is decreased 25 percent, EPA 32 percent, NASA 5 percent. On the other hand, the bill puts VA's total spending levels slightly above 1995 rather than cutting it substantially. The bill fully funds the President's request in several areas, with spending over and above the fiscal year 1995 level. These include compensations for veterans with service-connected injuries, pensions for war-time veterans, education and training re- adjustment benefits, insurance programs, and the VA Home Loan Program. Major construction is not as much as last year because the bill does not fully fund the two new inpatient hospital construction projects in the administration's request. Medical research, which is very important to VA's ability to attract high-quality health care professionals, is funded at last year's level. The national cemetery system is funded at last year's level to maintain this important ac- tivity. I believe the cemetery system is in particu- lar need of long-term attention because of de- mographic trends facing the veteran popu- lation. Between 1990 and the year 2010, the VA projects that the veterans population will de- crease by about 7 million veterans, or 26 per- cent. Many of these veterans will desire to be buried in a national cemetery and the VA should be ready. The annual operating budget for the ceme- tery system, as well as grave site develop- ment in existing cemeteries, and establish- ment of new cemeteries should receive high priority than they are currently getting. I will continue to work closely with the Ap- propriations Committee and the VA to expand and improve our national cemeteries so that veterans may be accorded the last measure of dignity a grateful Nation can provide in rec- ognition of service to country. H.R. 2099 increases VA medical care by $563 million. This is 75 percent of the admin- istration's requested increase, and puts VA medical care spending at $16.8 billion for fis- cal year 1996. This increase has been accomplished through a combination of additional appro- priated dollars and legislative savings which will probably not be possible again next year. The VA should use this year to prepare for tougher fiscal constraints through manage- ment initiatives such as the New Visions Net- works and the North Chicago hospital exam- ple. Integrating VA medical centers and other health care facilities on a regional basis can eliminate or reduce duplication of capacity and administration. Recent testimony in the Committee on Vet- erans' Affairs by the Disabled American Veter- ans indicates that the North Chicago VA Medi- cal Center has implemented an HMO-based model of health care delivery. Their experience apparently shows that since October of 1993, the number of veterans enrolled in their managed care plan increased fivefold. In less than 10 months, the number of acute days of hospital care per $1,000 enrollees fell by 85 percent. This was due to a reduction in the con- sumption of acute hospital resources due toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7833 July 27, 1995 50 percent reduction in hospital stays; 90 per- cent reduction in the need for acute hos- pitalization for nursing home care unit patients; and 98 percent reduction in acute hospitaliza- tion for detoxification resulting from a shift from inpatient medical evaluation of these pa- tients to an outpatient medical evaluation. The facility was able to reduce from five to only two the number of acute hospital wards, representing a 63 percent reduction in beds. The medical center estimates that they have tripled their efficiency. Quality of care was maintained while their operating costs were re- duced dramatically. It is projected that annual potential savings could exceed $15 million. Also, the realignment of services allowed for a reduction of 170 full-time positions. If such projected savings and increased effi- ciencies prove out, this example should be du- plicated as much as possible throughout the VA system. The VA should aggressively pursue initia- tives which can help reduce fixed costs and overhead, so that funds can be shifted to de- livery of health care and other services. The VA should eliminate or merge duplica- tive positions within the Veterans Health Ad- ministration and Veterans Benefits Administra- tion bureaucracy in areas of procurement, per- sonnel, logistics, EEO, administrative services, and finance. Such duplication is acutely apparent in the departments of Veterans Affairs organizations that are collocated or within networking proximities. The VA should also actively pursue privatizing service areas such as third party in- surance collections, laundry services, food service, and computer software development and fire protection services. The department currently has a tremendous opportunity to reap savings by more proactively implementing the Energy Policy Act of 1992. The DOE recently published final rules for accelerating installation of energy conservation measures in existing federally owned buildings through energy saving performance contracts with the private sector. These contracts allow Federal agencies to contract for energy conservation equipment and services with performance guarantees, and pay for them in the future from resulting energy cost savings. This program could boost energy efficiency investment significantly beyond what can be purchased with appropriate funds. The VA can use those savings to help main- tain services during tighter fiscal times. The Veterans' Affairs Committee will con- tinue to explore proposals to increase VA's flexibility to provide health care at the most appropriate level and in the most cost effective way. Working within current budget constraints, we will pursue eligibility and health care deliv- ery reform. We will also look for additional rev- enue sources for the VA health care system. I hope the VA will more aggressively pursue areas where it can save money to use for di- rect care rather than continuing to threaten closure of significant parts of the system. The VA should close its 22 golf courses and sell off all its excess land before closing any hospitals. The amount of money the VA receives each year is obviously critical to the amount of care which can be provided.But just as important is what the VA does with those dollars. Given a rapidly declining veterans popu- lation, the VA must improve strategic planning for its health care system, reevaluate infra- structure needs, enhance contracting and sharing agreements, and continue the shift away from expensive hospital inpatient care. Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to support the bill. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle- woman from New Jersey [Mrs. R OU- KEMA ]. Mrs. ROUKEMA. Mr. Chairman, I would tell my colleagues that I have shared some of the serious reservations that others have expressed on this floor today with the bill as it was reported from the committee. But may I say to the chairman of the committee that, as a former ranking member of the HUD subcommittee, I was very concerned about the HUD budget and the housing for the poor and the homeless. Let me be clear there is no question that HUD was certainly primed and ready for sig- nificant reductions. It is badly in need of reform, and in fact I would like to say it is in need of reinvention. That having been said, may I say that I understand the problems that the committee had in reaching our budget targets, and they were enor- mous. But I, along with the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO], quickly went to our committee members to state our concerns, particularly the concerns for the senior citizens, and the disabled, and those AIDS sufferers that have been talked about. Certainly these are needy and vulnerable popu- lations, and, more than that, for those of us who worked with HUD over the years and on these programs, we also know that these programs are not only among the most popular programs, but from my perspective among the most scandal-free and well-run programs in HUD, and so I was very pleased when Mr. L EWIS, the subcommittee chairman and others on the committee were re- sponsive to our concerns. We will talk a little bit more later about the manager's amendment, but I do want to say that many things have been corrected in this legislation. We have targeted with humaneness and sensitivity the problems that are most in need of reform and at the same time protected the concerns of the vulner- able populations. Compared to current funding levels, the bill deeply cuts appropriations for virtually every department and agency funded by the measure. Most signifi- cantly, the measure cuts funding for HUD by 25 percent and EPA by 32 per- cent. While at the same time, the NASA budget is cut by a mere 5 percent\u00d0as- suming full funding of Congress' new sacred cow, the space station. This is despite the fact that continuous redefi- nition of the goals and designs have in- flated the cost of this project more than $63 billion over budget before its completion. And despite the fact thatafter 11 years, not one piece of hard- ware has been put into space for this project. As the former ranking minority member on the Housing Subcommittee, I was very concerned about the effects of the cuts in the HUD budget. Let me be clear, HUD was primed for significant reductions. It is badly in need of reform\u00d0significant reform. In- deed, reinvention. But as the bill was reported out of committee, the combined cut to the programs affecting seniors, disabled persons, and people with AIDS\u00d0those people with special needs was 47 per- cent, from $1,852 billion in fiscal year 1995\u00d0prerecission\u00d0to $1 billion in fis- cal year 1996. These seniors, disabled and AIDS suffers, are among the most needy and vulnerable. And, I must stress these 202 and 206 programs are among the most popular and well run scandal free of all the programs under HUD jurisdiction. With that said, let me say that I rec- ognize the difficult task that our mem- bers on the Appropriations Committee have before them. If we are to meet the goal of a balanced budget by 2002, we must make difficult decisions and sig- nificant changes in Federal spending. We must work to fund the programs that work well and perform essential service while beginning the process of reducing or eliminating programs that are repetitive or ineffective. For this reason, I will be supporting Chairman Lewis's amendment to H.R. 2099. This amendment addresses many of the concerns raised by both Chair- man L AZIO and me. Including, retain- ing the ceiling of 30 percent on the re- tail levels for public housing tenants. I share the concerns of some of my col- leagues across the aisle about rent increases for residents of public housing. That's why I worked with Chairman L AZIOof Housing Sub- committee to remove the suspension of the Brooke amendment and minimum rents for public housing. These changes will be adopt- ed in the manager's amendment, and I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to support the manager's amendment. In particular, the floor manager's amend- ment increases the total aggregate budget au- thority for HUD from $19.1 to $19.4 billion. This brings HUD to the post rescission fiscal year 1995 funding level. Special needs housing for the elderly, dis- abled, and persons with AIDS is increased from the 1995 post-rescission amount of $1 billion to $1.4 billion, and HUD homeless as- sistance programs are increased by $100 mil- lion. In addition, this amendment restores $70 million in budget authority for FHA multifamily credit subsidy. This $70 million is sufficient to meet current multifamily credit needs and pro- vide funding authority for HUD and the author- izing committee to transition FHA's multifamily to a self-sustaining program. This amendment deserves the support of this House. The provisions included in this amendment make H.R. 2099 a better bill\u00d0one that I can support.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7834 July 27, 1995 Nevertheless, I must also note my reserva- tions and deep concerns over the funding lev- els and the legislative language and prohibi- tions on the enforcement abilities of the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency [EPA]. I welcome the full and open debate we will engage in during the amendments offered by S HERWOOD BOEHLERTand others. The CHAIRMAN. There are 31\u00a42min- utes remaining on each side. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Indiana [Mr. V ISCLOSKY ]. (Mr. VISCLOSKY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to the fiscal year 1996 VA\u00b1HUD appropriations bill. This bill is a polluters' bonanza. Our environment is cleaner today not because individual businesses decided to put themselves at a competitive dis- advantage and stop polluting. The air we breath and the water we drink is cleaner today because Congress passed Federal laws, which leveled the playing field for businesses and mandated a cleaner environment. Instead of building on this success and fine tuning our environmental laws, the Republican majority is bent on taking us back to the good old days of little or no environmental regula- tion. Let me tell you about the good old days. The good old days resulted in six declared superfund sites in my tiny northwest Indiana district. In the Black Oak section of Gary the water was so toxic that the residents couldn't drink it or even water their plants without killing them. In the good old days, a northwest Indiana river stopped flowing because it was clogged with animal carcasses. Why does the Repub- lican majority want to take us back to the good old days? If a regulation is silly we should end it. It a law is wrong we should change it. But we must not roll back years of environmental progress. Consider the drastic cuts to the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. This agency, whose sole purpose is to pro- tect public health and improve the liv- ing conditions of American citizens, will take a cut of 34 percent\u00d0the big- gest reduction by far for any major agency! But this Republican bill does not stop there\u00d0it also contains 17 leg- islative riders all aimed at curtailing or eliminating the EPA's ability to set environmental standards or enforce regulations that are aimed at protect- ing public health. What's the point of giving the EPA two-thirds of its fund- ing when you prohibit its enforcement of our laws in the same bill? Upon closer examination of the vicious as- saults upon the EPA, Mr. Chairman, I urge the House to oppose this bill. The VA\u00b1HUD bill cuts funding of hazardous waste site cleanup by 33 percent, or $560 mil- lion. Does the Republican Party believe this waste is just going to disappear? If we slow the cleanup by cutting funding, it will cost us more later. Furthermore, one in four Ameri- cans lives near a toxic waste dump. Are wehelping the citizens of this Nation by allowing the perpetuation of hazardous filth? Absolutely not. The VA\u00b1HUD bill slashes enforcement of all environmental programs by almost 50 percent. By cutting $245 million of the funds that en- force those laws, the Republican majority's proposal severely limits enforcement of the protections Americans demand and deserve\u00d0 and encourages polluters to continue breaking the law. Moreover, the cutback unfairly penal- izes the thousands of companies that have in- vested in pollution controls and played by the rules to protect our health and our environ- ment. It gets worse, ladies and gentlemen. For, the VA\u00b1HUD bill sharply limits citizens' right to know about toxics released in their own com- munity. By slashing funds used to provide American communities with information about toxic chemicals being emitted in local areas, citizens will be left in the dark. Toxic emis- sions don't understand property lines. People should have access to information about the toxics that are being emitted into their air, and harmful substances are polluting their streams. Thinking along practical lines, emergency workers need this information as well. If an environmental catastrophe were to occur in your community, would you feel safe with any less than the full information? And what about the housing provisions in this bill. It targets its deepest cuts at vulner- able populations: the poorest residents in pub- lic and assisted housing, the homeless, poor and working families and the elderly. The Department of Housing and Urban De- velopment has been slashed by 25 percent. HUD assists 4.7 million households living in public housing and receiving section 8 rental assistance. Of these households, 36 percent are elderly. Encompassing housing assistance for the elderly, HUD's Special Needs Housing program took an $852 million cut! Is this the Republican's moral mandate\u00d0to abandon our senior citizens and their need for decent, af- fordable housing? In my district, Merrillville, IN is lucky to be the home of the AHEPA House, a section 8 apartment complex that serves senior citizens. More than 100 elderly people are on AHEPA's waiting list. Recently, the AHEPA House was able to af- ford an expansion. There will be 50 new units opening up in September. Calls requesting ap- plications for those 50 units have been coming in from Indiana, Illinois and Michigan. So far, almost 150 people have applied for these 50 units. One hundred senior citizens are going to have to be turned away. When I recently spoke with AHEPA staff about the crisis, I was told they were ex- tremely concerned. One staff member spoke of those on the waiting list, ``I don't know how some of these people even eat,'' she said. Calls come in to AHEPA house every day ask- ing for help. If this bill passes, Congress will be sending a clear response to those calls for help. It comes in the form of a $852 million cut to the section 8 Special Needs Housing program. I urge a return to decency. Are we to turn our backs on senior citizens who are barely able to get a roof above their heads while ma- jority in this House finances a tax cut for the wealthiest in society? Of course not. This legislation is a travesty and a danger to the American people. Public health is threat-ened. Pollution is encouraged. Housing is de- nied. The elderly are abandoned. Let's stop these irresponsible and indecent proposals that hurt American citizens. Join me in opposition to this Republican bill and join me in a vote for the American people. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself the balance of our time. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from California is recognized for 31\u00a42 minutes. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, first I want to express my appre- ciation for the cooperation of the Mem- bers dealing with this very, very dif- ficult bill. We have had within our allo- cation great difficulty in dividing up these accounts in a way that is equi- table to all. There is little question that everyone who is used to govern- ment continuing to grow is most dis- concerted by the effort to reduce those historical levels of growth. Nonetheless, let me address two basic subject areas of this bill. I want to make sure that it is clear in the RECORD that, while we have been through some very difficult times with housing, we have had great cooperation from the key members from the au- thorizing committee in connection with the way we have distributed these funds. It is a fact that housing ac- counts have increased by 50 percent in the last 4 years, so there is some room for flexibility as we address those prob- lems. In terms of actual spending in the 1996 year, the outlays for housing will actually increase over 1995. Those pro- grams will have both time and a good deal of flexibility in terms of respond- ing to the future pattern that we hope to see in these accounts. Beyond that, I want to mention to my colleagues that the one account within this bill that has been treated differently than all others has to do with Veterans Administration medical services. There is an increase of some $553 million over the 1995 outlay ac- count for medical services. The House has indicated its concern about making sure that we do not have cuts in medi- cal services available to our veterans. As my colleagues look throughout the bill, while there is very, very tough decisions that have been made, there is little doubt that the membership has helped the committee a great deal to make sure that we have treated each of these responsibilities as fairly as pos- sible. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. P ALLONE ]. Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], and also the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], and my colleagues the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. F RELINGHUYSEN ] for their help in correcting a FEMA problem in my district as part of this legislation. I also appreciate the need for belt-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7835 July 27, 1995 tightening as identified by the chair- man, but I must point out that the En- vironmental Protection Agency, I be- lieve, is treated too harshly in this bill. Mr. Chairman, the bill contains about eight pages of provisos limiting the EPA's ability to improve, imple- ment, and enforce regulations related to the environment and particularly with regard to the Clean Water Act that passed this House, which I op- posed. If it does become law, this legis- lation would attempt to accomplish much of its negative impact through the appropriation process. Just as examples: If the Clean Water Act was not reauthorized by October 1 of 1996, funds are not available or are limited under this bill for implementa- tion or enforcement of the stormwater permitting process, enforcement of per- mit limits or compliance schedules for combined sewer overflows or sanitary sewer overflows. There is also cutback in implementation in enforcement of the wetlands programs and pretreatment standards. For these reasons, unless some of the amendments are passed by the ranking member, I would oppose. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog- nizes the gentleman from Ohio for 11\u00a42 minutes. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, let me in closing say once again how dis- appointing it is for me to have to vote against this particular bill. It is a bill that, as I said earlier, in the last Con- gress I took a great deal of pride in bringing to the floor, and it was a bill which I felt was responsive to the Na- tion's priorities at that time. Unfortu- nately I do not feel that this bill is cur- rently responsive to our needs, and, therefore, I must oppose the bill. But also in closing, a lot of com- ments have been made with reference to what has been done for veterans, and I just want to cite some of the state- ments that have come to us by way of letters. ``We strongly oppose any action by the Committee on Appropriations to make substantive changes to laws au- thorizing veterans benefits''\u00d0the Blinded Veterans Association. The Vietnam Veterans of America say ``We like to see an appropriation bill that provides for medical research, and running the Veterans' Administra- tion at the levels recommended by the President. There is room for change, but we cannot accept substantive changes in the veterans benefits laws being made by the appropriations com- mittees.'' I can go on and cite the American Le- gion's response, the Paralyzed Veter- ans of America response, all of whom are not satisfied with this bill as it ap- pears now. As I said earlier, the President has indicated that unless this bill is changed substantively from its current form, that he intends to veto the bill. I think the best thing Members of this House can do is vote down the bill.Mr. FILNER: Mr. Chairman, I rise today to alert you to a matter of utmost importance. Many of you know of the large number of vet- erans residing in California, and especially in my congressional district. I am committed to seeing that we do not abandon our veterans, especially those who are in need of care\u00d0ranging from moderate care in assisted-living situations to full nursing home care. These veterans, who have sac- rificed so much for our Nation, deserve to have their country come through for them when they need help. Last October, the California Governor's Task Force selected a site in Chula Vista, CA as their top choice for a proposed home for military veterans. This is an excellent site, given the large number of veterans in Chula Vista and the nearby community of National City. This site is near Sharp Chula Vista Medi- cal Center and within a 20 minute drive to the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in La Jolla, CA. Close to the waterfront and lo- cated in a stable community, this home will provide southern California veterans with the care they need and deserve. It will also create 250 to 300 permanent jobs for this region. The construction of this home depends in part upon funding from the Federal Govern- ment. The State of California will fund 35 per- cent of the cost\u00d0the State assembly has passed the appropriations for this project and the bill is now pending in the State senate. The State will soon be applying to the Federal Government for the remainder of the fund- ing\u00d0and I intend to fight to insure that this funding is available. This money will come from the line item, grants for construction of State extended care facilities, in the Federal Veterans' Health Ad- ministration construction budget. I am here today to advocate for our veter- ans. We must never forget their service to our country. We must remain steadfast in our sup- port as they grow older. I am as committed as anyone to balancing our Federal budget, but not on the backs of our veterans. I urge my colleagues to keep the promise to our veterans during these budget deliberations and vote to retain the State home construction program funding. Our vet- erans deserve no less. Mr. TOWNS. Mr. Chairman, I want to com- pliment the gentleman from California, the chairman of the subcommittee for his willing- ness to increase the funding for the special needs account. If the HOPWA Program funds remained at the level reported by the Appro- priations Committee, it would have resulted in significant program cuts for New York City. Homelessness would have surely increased for people living with HIV infection. This limita- tion on funding would have delayed the re- lease of homeless inpatients and prevented in- dividuals and families from moving out of housing that is no longer adequate to the health status of a person with AIDS. Fortu- nately, because of the compromise that you reached with my good friend from Long Island, Mr. LAZIO, New York City has been spared these serious program reductions. I want to complement you Mr. Chairman and all of my colleagues, Mr. S HAYS, Mr. SCHUMER, and Ms. LOWEY, who have been worked so hard to de- velop a positive solution for restoring the HOPWA funds. Mr. CLEMENT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in op- position to the amendment.The bill before us places many vital services such as housing, veterans benefits, and envi- ronmental protection on life support. The amendment seeks to sustain some of these important programs through a transfusion. Un- fortunately, the transfusion is inadequate and is not sufficient to bring about a full recovery. In the process, a program no less meritorious than those the amendment seeks to protect will perish. This is the 19th vote on the space station program. The station has been studied and re- designed to death. We are less than 30 months away from deployment\u00d0enough is enough. As if terminating the space station was not enough, the amendment reduces funding for NASA an additional 20 percent below the level the President requested and severely threat- ens the viability of the space shuttle program. The loss of these two programs will result in the loss of more than 50,000 jobs and count- less dreams. Over the last 2 years, NASA has managed to keep the birds flying while absorbing a 30- percent cut. Frankly, I consider that a phe- nomenal feat. Dan Goldin and the men and women at NASA deserve our gratitude and appreciation for their hard work. But, the truth is Dan Goldin has run out of miracles. NASA simply cannot handle any more major pro- grammatic cuts. There is no more water in the well. So, although I am sympathetic to the gentle- man's efforts to correct the deficiencies in the bill, I do not agree with his method. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2099, the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropria- tions bill. As vice chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am especially pleased that, under this bill, the VA will experience a $159 million increase over fiscal year 1995's levels. The Appropriations Committee is to be com- mended for asserting that, even in these times of fiscal restraint, our Nation's veterans de- serve quality health care and equitable com- pensation for their service to our country. The VA's medical care account will be in- creased by over half a billion dollars from last year. The compensation and pension program will see a $23 million increase from fiscal year 1995. Funding for readjustment benefits, which assists former service members in get- ting acclimated to civilian life, will increase over $50 million. Mr. Speaker, New Jersey's veterans will be greatly assisted by this appropriations bill. In- cluded in the funding for minor construction projects are two programs\u00d0a geriatric patient care program at the Lyons VAMC and a low vision center at the East Orange VAMC\u00d0 which will bring immediate relief to thousands of New Jersey veterans who previously were forced to travel out of State for these types of care. I will be working with Veteran's Affairs Chairman S TUMPto ensure that report lan- guage endorsing these initiatives\u00d0along with an outpatient cancer chemotherapy center at the East Orange VAMC\u00d0is included in our construction authorization bill to be marked up later this year. I have also been working with the New Jer- sey Department of Military and Veterans Af- fairs in an attempt to secure funding for a re- placement State nursing home located inCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7836 July 27, 1995 Menlo Park, NJ. We have gone through a grueling application process and are encour- aged that Menlo Park will be at or near the top of a priority list of deserving applicants. Be- cause the Appropriations Committee funded the Grants for Construction of State Extended Care Facilities Program at last year's equitable level, we can be assured that sufficient funds will be available to fully fund those projects deemed most worthy. I would like to thank Chairman L EWISfor all his hard work on this spending bill. It is fair to veterans, while still being mindful of the Na- tion's fiscal realities. I urge my colleagues to support the bill. Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to cuts in the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program which are part of the Ap- propriations bill for Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. The bill reduces funding for the Department of Housing and Urban Development by $5.6 billion, or 23 percent below the 1995 level. It cuts funding for important programs which have important and beneficial impacts on the lives of many elderly and low-income Ameri- cans. I cannot turn my back on these people, so I want to bring some facts about these pro- grams to the attention of the House. While all Members of the House would claim to be opposed to the sale and use of il- legal drugs, funding for the Public Housing Drug Elimination Program is zeroed-out in this bill. This program funds effective locally-run ef- forts to eliminate drugs. It is a key tool to help local housing authorities combat crime in pub- lic housing communities in Massachusetts and through-out the country. The Drug Elimination Program received $290 million in fiscal year 1995. This money is used to fight drug distribution and abuse by reimbursing local law enforcement agencies, by employing security personnel and inves- tigators, by providing physical improvements designed to enhance security, and by support- ing tenant patrol groups. Along with making communities safer, it also funds the creation of innovative youth programs, offering young people and adults positive alternatives to drug use. This money is a very cost-effective expendi- ture. The costs of drug use include higher se- curity and law enforcement costs, a lower quality of life, lower educational attainment, and higher healthcare costs. Compared to the terrible costs which drug use imposes upon in- dividuals and communities, this program is a bargain, and it is essential. In my district, several housing authorities were recipients of drug elimination funds in 1995, including Medford ($240,000), Chelsea ($175,000), Woburn ($50,000), and Malden ($250,000). The end of funding for these pro- grams would significantly hamper efforts to lessen drug use and improve the quality of life in these communities. Mr. Chairman, I call upon the House to put taxpayers' money where their commitments are, and to continue funding for the Drug Elimination Program. The House recently funded $553 million as the down payment to build two additional B\u00b12 bombers that the Pentagon didn't ask for or want. Let's stop wasting money on unwanted planes and start saving wasted lives. Mr. FAZIO of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill.The Republicans have once again adopted a paint-by-numbers strategy to reach their ar- bitrary deficit reduction target and finance a tax break for wealthy special interests. How simple is their strategy? Remarkably simple. And remarkably cruel. Draw a line through those programs that help the poor, the needy, and the less fortu- nate. Slash your way across the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Department of Veterans Affairs, until you reach the Environmental Protection Agency. Along the way, strike a crippling blow against housing programs that provide afford- able, safe, and decent housing for the elderly, the poor, and the sick. When you're painting by numbers, when your goal is driven by numbers, not by people, it's easy to pursue your goal with abandon. I would like to take this opportunity to re- mind my Republican colleagues that behind those numbers are real human beings, living real lives, and struggling to get by in tough times. A great number of the public housing units in this country are occupied by elderly women. And over a million of our children\u00d0of Ameri- ca's children\u00d0live in public housing units. For many of these kids, just about the only thing they can depend on, from day to day, is a place to go home to at night. This bill slashes public housing operating subsidies and modernization funds. The bill eliminates\u00d0obliterates\u00d0funding for severely distressed public housing and development, in addition to new housing vouchers and certifi- cates for the poor. If you're homeless, forget it. The Repub- licans have decided to paint you out of the picture, cutting homeless assistance grants by 50 percent. The Republican approach is really very sim- ple. They shake your hand and direct your at- tention to the magnificent prize behind curtain No. 3. When you turn your head, they reach around and pick your pocket. Hundreds of thousands of families who de- pend on section 8 assisted housing will get their pockets picked if this bill passes. At least 600,000 families in public and section 8 as- sisted housing will pay more every month in rent unless we reject this bill. While we debate these cuts, I urge my col- leagues to remember that this week marks a particularly poignant moment. Today, we will dedicate a monument to the veterans of the Korean war. There are few Americans more deserving of our support than these veterans, and the vet- erans of our wars of the last half-century. Yet, the Republican bill cuts $250 million from veterans medical care and zeroes-out funding for a replacement VA hospital in Northern California that was to service a veter- ans population of over 400,000 men and women. These cuts are unwise and break a promise that Congress made to Northern Cali- fornia veterans 4 years ago. Without adequate support, the VA will sim- ply be unable to meet the increasing demand for health services as our veterans population ages. Once again, the Republican's have enacted wholesale change that will significantly de- crease the quality of life for millions of Ameri- cans. The Republicans profess to have our long- term interests at stake, but their actions\u00d0in this case\u00d0speak loudly and clearly.This bill not only risks the health of our vet- erans, but the health and safety of all Ameri- cans. Unable to eliminate the EPA, my Republican colleagues have done their level best to crip- ple this agency and eviscerate programs that ensure every American has access to safe drinking water, clean air, and a toxic-free envi- ronment. This bill cuts the EPA budget by one-third, hazardous waste cleanup programs by 30 per- cent, and funds for wastewater treatment fa- cilities by 25 percent. Perhaps most devastating is the legislative language in this bill that would prohibit the EPA from taking action to clean our environ- ment. These include restrictions on the EPA's ability to regulate sewer systems, wetlands, refineries, oil and gas manufacturing, radon in water, pesticides in processed food, lead paint and water pollution. Some very important programs\u00d0such as the Sacramento River Pollutant Control Pro- gram\u00d0have been funded in this bill. With this funding, Sacramento County will be able to complete the process of identifying which pol- lutants exceed water quality standards. Once this is accomplished, the county can develop a feasible, cost-effective plan to address the problem of pollution in the Sacramento River. While this critical program has been funded, hundreds of others around the country have not. The Sacramento River Pollutant Control Program is a step in the right direction. But it does not begin to make up for the hundreds of steps back in this bill. All of us have been asked to make sac- rifices to help balance the Federal budget. We are prepared to make those sacrifices. But no one\u00d0not one American\u00d0should have to sac- rifice decent living conditions or a clean envi- ronment to finance a tax-break for Republican special interests. Mr. GEJDENSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my strong opposition to H.R. 2099, the Department of Veterans' Affairs [VA], Housing and Urban Development [HUD] and Independent Agencies appropriations bill. This short-sighted legislation is a devastating attack on low-income Americans, seniors, vet- erans and disabled individuals. It drastically cuts worthwhile housing programs, does not provide adequate funding for veterans' pro- grams, completely eliminates AmeriCorps, and is one of the most blatant attacks I have ever seen on our most comprehensive environ- mental laws. I strongly urge my colleagues to reject this bill. First, with respect to HUD programs, fund- ing levels for the current fiscal year do not meet the current demand and will force people to live in substandard housing or worse yet get thrown out on the street. That's not only bad policy but it's mean. Further, I am disappointed that the bill con- solidates accounts for special needs housing such as assistance for low-income seniors, disabled individuals and people with AIDS [HOPWA]. This consolidation would have been more tolerable had the funding level been set at the FY 95 aggregate amount. But it doesn't. In fact, H.R. 2099 reduces this funding by 46% compared to FY 95. The measure also eliminates the important congregate services program. Simply put this is mean. But the Republicans did not stop there. H.R. 2099 reduces funding from the current fiscalCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7837 July 27, 1995 year for the modernization of existing public housing projects, seriously affecting capital im- provement projects at many public housing authorities, in my district and across the coun- try. Many of these facilities were built nearly 40 years ago and are beginning to fall into dis- repair. This is mean and bad economics. Second, it saddens me to think that AmeriCorps is being abolished. This program accomplishes what many in Congress have been calling for: federal money directed to local communities without interference from Washington. It taps into the desire of many young people to have a positive impact on their community by encouraging them to vol- unteer in education, environment, poverty and public safety programs. Detractors say that the government shouldn't be in the business of supporting charities. AmeriCorps is far from a charity: the participants earn scholarship money to further their education. Others say that paid volun- teers will undermine the spirit of volunteerism in the United States. The truth is, these young adults are paid only a small stipend. It is fool- ish to think that the AmeriCorps participants are doing this for monetary gain. In addition, many charities have fallen on hard times and are only too glad to have the help of these ``paid'' volunteers. All this, however, disregards the basic idea of AmeriCorps: Encouraging national service at the grassroots level. Killing AmeriCorps will have a minuscule impact on the effort to bal- ance the budget, but it will also kill the enthu- siasm the program was designed to inspire in young Americans. Third, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has long been the target of polluters and their allies in Congress. I'll be the first to admit that the Agency has often been inflexi- ble in its approach and too ready to restore to heavy-handed tactics. At the same time, I be- lieve Administrator Carol Browner has insti- tuted many internal reforms which have made the Agency more ``user-friendly'' while effec- tively carrying out its obligations to protect our environment and public health. I strongly be- lieve that the Administrator has been respon- sive to Congressional mandates and requests. In spite of these actions, the bill before us is a vicious attack on the Agency, its mission and its personnel. And make no mistake about it, this measure is a threat to every American because it will compromise water and air qual- ity, prevent hazardous waste cleanups and allow polluters to violate the law as long as they let states know they are doing it. The cuts in EPA are devastating. The bill provides $2.35 billion less than the current fis- cal year and $2.5 billion less than requested. Compliance and enforcement programs are slashed by nearly $460 million below FY 1995 and by $884 million below the request. These cuts will prevent the Agency from effectively enforcing the Clean Air and Water Acts, Safe Drinking Water Act, Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), the Community Right-to-Know Act and many other environ- mental statutes. The report accompanying the bill makes it clear to this member that these massive cuts are designed to punish the Agency for carrying out its duties in a manner which is at odds with the vision of some of my colleagues. If members have problems with the direction of the Agency or wish to attempt to amend our environmental laws, they should utilize the authorization process to effect thesechanges. H.R. 2099 is an inappropriate vehi- cle to attempt to make major policy changes. The bill makes deep cuts in the Superfund program. I do not believe a single member of this body, including this member, would argue that Superfund is flawless. I agree with many of my colleagues that we must reform this im- portant program to reduce litigation, to direct more resources to cleanup and to set some parameters which link cleanup standards to fu- ture land uses. However, slashing funding by more than $400 million below the current level and prohibiting actions at new sites is not the best way to accomplish reform. This action is more akin to cutting off your nose to spite your face. This action also poses a real threat to human health because it prohibits the Agency or a contractor at a site to move beyond the stage of work in which the entity is engaged at the beginning of the fiscal year. Under these restrictions, the Agency or contractor would be prohibited from beginning to remedi- ate a site if it was not in that phase of the process when the fiscal year begins. This limi- tation makes no sense. The most important goal of Superfund is to physically clean up sites and we should do everything we can to ensure that remediation moves forward as quickly as possible. If sites are on the cusp of being cleaned up but aren't, the American people have no one to blame but the Repub- licans on the Committee who wrote this bill. In addition, the bill provides all funding for the program from the Treasury rather than from the Superfund which is largely capitalized by fees assessed on chemical manufacturers and on petroleum products as well as by reve- nue from settlements with polluters. The Com- mittee has done this because some members of this body want to transform Superfund from a polluter-pays statute to a taxpayer-pays stat- ute. This transformation will take place by doing away with retroactive liability and requir- ing every American to pay to clean up sites contaminated by a small number of companies or parties. While it might be appropriate to re- peal retroactive liability under certain cir- cumstances, this policy change must be care- fully evaluated through the authorization proc- ess. The funding arrangement required by this bill effectively makes Superfund a public works project in fiscal year 1996. This change is de- signed to let polluters off the hook and will shift the costs of cleaning up every Superfund site from those responsible for the contamina- tion to the taxpayers. Nothing is more important to our survival than clean water. The American people in poll after poll have expressed their overwhelming support for the Clean Water Act (CWA) and for directing their tax dollars to ensuring our nation's waters are clean and safe. Unfortu- nately, this bill falls far short of the expecta- tions of the American people. The bill provides $761 million less for water infrastructure projects than the current level. As a result, communities across the country will not be able to upgrade or build new sewage treat- ment plants. Modern sewage treatment can be credited with improving water quality in more communities than virtually any other measure. While we have made tremendous progress since the enactment of the CWA, the states have estimated that they have in excess of $130 billion in sewage treatment projects out- standing. Investing in these projects makes good environmental, public health and eco- nomic sense. However, the Committee billfails to provide adequate federal investment in this vital area. My state of Connecticut esti- mates that it will lose $9 million in assistance from the CWA State Revolving Fund. As a re- sult, the state will be forced to abandon sev- eral major sewage treatment plant upgrades or many smaller ones. This is a lose-lose proposition for my constituents and one with which they shouldn't be faced with. In addition, the Committee eliminates all funding to support drinking water treatment grants. Millions of Americans continue to drink, and continue to get sick and die from drinking contaminated water. We don't know exactly how many Americans become sick each year because many people believe they have the stomach flu rather than attribute their illness to tainted water. Many of the problems with drinking water contamination can be traced to thousands for small water systems which serve millions of Americans largely in rural areas. These systems do not have the rate base to purchase modern treatment tech- nology or to adequately protect source waters. In fiscal year 1995, the Congress provided $700 million to capitalize the Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, similar to the ex- isting State Revolving Fund, to provide assist- ance to communities to improve and develop water treatment systems. This revolving funds would be most beneficial to the small systems I mentioned above. Instead of investing in im- proving the health of millions of rural Ameri- cans, the committee eliminated all funding for this important initiative. This is action that adds insult to injury coming on the heals of the Republican rescission package which took back more than $1 billion provided for this pur- pose. These accounts support activities which have direct impacts on public health and envi- ronmental protection. The American people want their resources to be spent to improve sewage treatment or to ensure that drinking water is free from harmful contaminants such as cryptosporidium. Moreover, these accounts provide assistance to communities and sys- tems which have great needs, but lack the tax or rate base to pay the full costs associated with these needs. Finally, this is not a Federal giveaway. States must contribute their own dollars and many States, including my State of Connecticut, contribute far more than required by law. Federal support helps to ensure that every community can have safe water. More- over, it guarantees that communities which in- vest their own resources do not have those in- vestments compromised by communities up- stream which cannot, or do not, invest in these areas. This is yet another example of the counterproductive cuts contained in nu- merous appropriations bills being brought to the floor this year. Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill is loaded down with 17 ``riders'' which prohibit the EPA from enforcing some of the most important sections of the Clean Air, Water, Safe Drinking Water and Community Right-to-Know Acts. By including these far-reaching provisions, the committee wins the award for legislating in an appropriations bill. Make no mistake about it, these riders are legislative provisions and are not simply spending restrictions. In fact, Chair- man LEWISreferred to these riders as ``legisla- tive provisions'' in a story about this bill in to- day's Congress Daily. Every American is threatened by the restrictions imposed in the provisions in question. Under the committeeCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7838 July 27, 1995 bill, the EPA will not be able to enforce stand- ards to curb nonpoint source pollution, to stem the discharge of raw sewage, to limit arsenic and radon in drinking water, or to ensure that communities are fully informed about the toxic chemicals which are released in the air. I believe these provisions are detrimental to the interests of the American people and have been included at the behest of narrow special interests. In spite of overwhelming evidence that runoff from city streets, parking lots, and feed lots is the largest remaining water pollu- tion problem, the bill prohibits EPA from en- forcing standards to reduce contamination from these sources. Regardless of the fact that raw sewage is routinely discharged from storm drains nationwide following heavy rains, the Agency is barred from enforcing standards which will substantially reduce this public health threat. In a major blow to States like mine, which have taken aggressive steps to improve air quality, the bill allows questionable vehicle inspection programs to be given equal weight with centralized inspection programs. Moreover, it prevents the enforcement of cer- tain rules which limit toxic chemical emissions into our air. These Clean-Air-Act-related provi- sions are especially egregious for Connecticut which is a dumping ground for air pollution generated in Western States. While certain States and their Representatives in Congress are decrying the alleged burdens imposed by the act and inserting provisions into this bill to delay their enforcement, these provisions will force residents in my State to endure very real burdens from western polluters. I could go on and on about the harmful ef- fects of these riders. I could go on to talk about how the bill prohibits the EPA from issu- ing standards designed to limit the amount of arsenic in drinking water. That's right Mr. Chairman, arsenic. Suffice it to say, these pro- visions are extremely damaging and represent a calculated attack on environmental protec- tion. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment of the gentleman from Ohio, Mr. STOKES, and the gentleman from New York, Mr. BOEHLERT, to strike each and every rider from the bill. Policy changes of this magnitude should be addressed in the authorizing com- mittees and in clear view of the American peo- ple. Mr. Chairman, members should defeat this legislation. While I understand the need to bal- ance the budget and reduce the deficit, this bill is no answer. This bill would hurt veterans, seniors, disabled individuals, and low-income families. Further, it is bad for the environment, public health, and the economy. It makes sweeping changes in our most fundamental environmental protection laws completely out- side of the authorization process. If the House passes this bill as reported by the committee, we might as well do away with authorizing committees and turn everything over to the Appropriations Committee. Passing this bill will set a terrible procedent. Simply stated, this bill is mean, Mr. Chair- man. Mr. GEKAS. Mr. Chairman, during the course of the debate on this bill, I have heard several of my colleagues imply that as far as this Nation's investment in biomedical re- search is concerned, we should cancel the space station and just dump the money into similar research activities at the National Insti- tutes of Health [NIH]. What this kind of sug- gestion tells me is that the nature of NASA'sprogram of biomedical research and its col- laboration with the NIH is woefully misunder- stood. I'd like to take this opportunity, there- fore, to highlight briefly the intellectual under- pinning of NASA's program of biomedical re- search and the nature of the collaboration be- tween NASA and the NIH. On Earth, we are prisoners of gravity. Grav- ity influences all life on Earth. Gravity influ- ences the behavior of everything\u00d0from single- celled organisms to rocks, plants, and ships at sea\u00d0on the surface of this small blue planet. When we fall, we fall down. We stay attached to the chairs in our offices because of the con- stant pull of gravity. In the plant world, roots grown down. Even in our own bodies, our hearts have to work harder when we stand than when we're lying down. Try as hard as I might, I can't even begin to imagine what life would be like on Earth without gravity. So, too, gravity has influenced and shaped the development of all life on Earth for millions of years, ever since life on Earth began some 31\u00a42billion years ago. In space, there is very little gravity. This radically different environment is sometimes referred to as ``zero-g,'' or, more accurately, microgravity. For researchers in the field of biomedicine, this is an essential distinction, for the microgravity environment of space allows them to unmask gravity and to see, in many cases, for the first time, deeply into the phys- ical, chemical, and biological processes which were previously obscured by gravity. Thus, thanks to our space program, for the first time in the history of humankind, scientists can ma- nipulate gravity by decreasing its force as well as increasing it. This allows us to manipulate a primary force in nature in a way that prom- ises to lead to radical new scientific discov- eries about life on Earth. This new capacity provides the intellectual underpinning of the relationship between NIH and NASA, and is the reason that thousands of life and biomedical scientists across the Na- tion want to conduct a portion of their research in space. Over the past 2 years, many researchers at the National Institutes of Health [NIH] have ex- pressed excitement over discoveries in the field of biomedicine. NIH scientists and NASA scientists have worked together on these problems since the days of the Mercury, Gem- ini, and Apollo space flight programs. Nearly 3 years ago, this partnership was formalized be- tween NASA and the NIH for space bio- medical research scientists. Today, this partnership is thriving. NASA and the NIH have executed 18 cooperative agreements since 1992 and joint activities have included: scientific workshops; ground- based and flight investigations; and cialized activities, such as a spaceline ref- erence system developed with the National Li- brary of Medicine [NLM]. As the world's premier organization in life and biomedical sciences, the NIH has access to the world's best biomedical scientists, who need a variety of laboratory resources. NASA's biomedical research program main- tains and develops a rich supply of unique and specialized resources, including laboratories and access to the weightless environment of space. Thus, cooperation between the two agencies strengthens the performance of each and helps to ensure the highest possible re- turn on America's investment in biomedical re- search.Cooperation between NASA and the Na- tional Institutes of Health has expanded rap- idly as the research community's understand- ing of the value of orbital research has grown. This cooperation expands access to NASA fa- cilities and resources to a broader community of the world's finest research scientists. Co- operation between these two premier Federal science agencies leverages NASA's unique fa- cilities, including orbital facilities, to produce the maximum return on America's investment in biomedical research. Collaborative partners in space research, NASA and the NIH look forward to an expand- ing level of cooperation as orbital research en- ters the space station era. NIH researchers are expected to use the Space Station's next generation life sciences facilities, including the human research facility, the gravitational biol- ogy facility, and the centrifuge facility, in pur- suit of national biomedical research goals. Let me take this opportunity to share some specific examples of this thriving partnership with you. Neurolab, NASA's next dedicated life sciences space shuttle mission, will carry in- vestigations funded by five different institutes of NIH. NIH's Division of Research Grants managed the scientific peer review for all neurolab proposals. Neurolab will be launched on the space shuttle in March, 1998 and will support research in the brain and behavioral sciences. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders [NIDCD] and NASA are co-funding a Center on Vestibular Research and Training at the Northwestern University Medical School with research sites in Chicago, Il, and Portland, Or. Each agency is funding this center at $500,000 a year. Dr. Josh Zimmerberg of the NIH National In- stitute for Child Health and Human Develop- ment is using NASA-developed bioreactors and NASA-funded resident technical staff to pursue AIDS research goals under a 1994\u00b1 1998 NASA\u00b1NIH joint venture. NASA and the National Cancer Institute have developed a joint program to apply NASA developed digital imaging technology to improve early diagnosis for breast cancer. Dig- ital mammography will be more sensitive than the current procedures. The National Institute of Arthritis and Mus- culoskeletal and Skin Diseases has released a program announcement for supplements to its Osteoporosis Centers for research related to space flight. The point I'm trying to make, Mr. Chairman, is that the NASA\u00b1NIH relationship is not one of competition\u00d0it's one of collaboration. Shut- ting down NASA space research, canceling the international space station and handing the money over to the NIH wouldn't solve the problem, for the NIH would have no way of getting into space, or of using the international space station. NASA needs the NIH, Mr. Chairman and part of the NIH certainly needs NASA. It is precisely this kind of collaboration which en- sures the highest return possible on America's investment in biomedical research. Mr. POMBO. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to address the section of H.R. 2099, the fiscal year 1996 VA\u00b1HUD Appropriations Bill, that will prevent the Federal Emergency Manage- ment Agency [FEMA] from spending any fur- ther taxpayer dollars for work on Flood Insur-CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7839 July 27, 1995 ance Rate Maps [FIRM] for the City of Stock- ton and San Joaquin County, CA. I have worked with this appropriations subcommittee to see that language is included in this bill that would ensure that these inaccurate and defi- cient maps are not prematurely imposed on the Stockton metropolitan area. This Congress must ensure that FEMA is a partner with the city and county in providing accurate and com- plete information on the risk of flooding and to assist in coordinating the completion of im- provements to the existing levee system. Such a coordinated effort will more rapidly restore an adequate level of flood protection and en- hance, rather than threaten, the regional and state economies. Unlike most FEMA floodplain maps for ur- banized areas, the proposed FIRMs for Stock- ton do not indicate flood depths. Such infor- mation is critical to determine insurance pre- mium rates and building code requirements. Because FEMA did not provide this informa- tion during its most recent flood insurance study, the city and county can only estimate flood depths, thereby assuming liability for in- accurate estimates, in addition to its individual property owners incurring the costs of deter- mining the appropriate flood depths. In order to minimize this cost to property owners, the city and county have stepped forward to fully finance the necessary flood depth study. This necessary study is expected to be completed in two years. The legislation we are adopting today will suspend FEMA's maps and ensuing process, at least for one year, while the study is conducted. FEMA's draft maps also contain significant errors. Processing has already been delayed by FEMA because of omissions and inclusions that were not part of the initial draft. The city and county have already hired an engineering firm to review the maps, and numerous other errors have been found. Despite the fact that the city and county are moving rapidly to re- view the proposed FIRMs, the 90-day appeal period allowed by FEMA is insufficient time considering the vast area that has been remapped. My provision contained in the ap- propriations bill is intended to prevent the ap- peal period from expiring while more accurate data is collected and eventually provided to FEMA. Mr. Chairman, FEMA has praised the city and county for the initiative they have exer- cised to respond to these maps and the po- tential for future flooding. Since being notified last November, that nearly the entire metro- politan area was being redesignated as a floodplain, the local governments have already established a joint powers authority [JPA], re- tained engineering and public finance consult- ants, and appropriated more than $2 million. The city and county JPA plans to construct the needed flood protection improvements without federal financial assistance in order to expe- dite completion of the project. The JPA has al- ready established a fast-track schedule that begins construction in May 1996 and expects completion before the end of 1998. We must now ensure that FEMA's administrative ac- tions assist rather than impede this effort. Mr. SKAGGS. Mr. Chairman, as it comes to the floor of the House today this bill is not only an abuse of the legislative process but a threat to the quality of America's air and water, the safety of America's food supply, and the health of all Americans.This bill is striking evidence that the new Republican majority in the House is intent on carrying out a sneak attack on public health, on environmental protection, and on our public lands. Following the unfortunate example of James Watt, they are distorting the normal legislative process around here, acting against House rules by using the appropriations proc- ess to rewrite law and reshape policy, so that they can achieve, by stealth, objectives that lack real public support. We saw the start of this pattern with the first rescissions bill, with its pages of legislative language waiving environmental and forest management laws, language that under the normal rules of the House should not have been in any bill of that kind. We saw it again in the Interior appropria- tions bill, with its provisions to dissolve the Na- tional Biological Service, transfer its functions to the U.S. Geological Service and its provi- sions to essentially eliminate the Mojave Na- tional Preserve in California as a unit of the National Park Service, by a back-door attack instead of a straightforward proposal to repeal or amend the California Desert Protection Act. Now, here it is again, and even worse, in this bill's provisions dealing with the Environ- mental Protection Agency. That part of this bill has more riders than the Long Island Railroad. Most of them are intended to prevent the gov- ernment from doing its job in protecting our water, our air, our wetlands, our health. Just take a look at the passenger count, Mr. Chairman, the number of riders on just that one part of this bill. In just seven pages, there are 21 anti-environment riders, including the following provisions: blocking enforcement of air pollution permits; limiting enforcement of stormwater and sanitary sewer provisions in the Water Pollution Control Act; handicapping the EPA's ability under the Clean Air Act to regulate toxic emissions from certain refiner- ies; putting other limits on enforcing environ- mental laws affecting other parts of the oil and gas industry; stopping EPA from taking steps to keep arsenic, radon, or other radionuclei out of our drinking water; limiting the EPA's ef- forts to control toxic releases from cement kilns and other incinerators; restricting the gathering and publishing of information about the use of chemicals; restricting the protection of the country's wetlands; blocking efforts to encourage car-pooling; restricting efforts to im- prove water quality in the Great Lakes; and, undermining the regulation of pesticides in food. Mr. Chairman, the pattern could not be clearer. Just take a look at it, page after page of regressive, antienvironmental and under- handed provisions aimed at handcuffing efforts to protect our food supply, keep our air and water clean, protect vital wetlands, all things vital to our natural systems all over the coun- try. It's no wonder, Mr. Chairman, that Carol Browner, the EPA Administrator, has con- cluded that we are seeing ``an organized, con- cerned effort to undermine public health and safety and the environment.'' If anything, Carol Browner understates the situation. The American people need to know what is going on. They need to know that this new Republican majority is determined to under- mine the progress we have made in the last several decades in protecting our environ- ment, progress that the American people are proud of and want to see continued. Theyneed to know that we are in the midst of a full- fledged attack on the safeguards of the water we drink and the air we breathe. They need to know, because when they do know, they will reject this assault on public health, public safety, and the public lands. Mr. Chairman, the American people know that we need to do more, not less, in this area. For instance, two new studies this year tell us that 53 million Americans are drinking tap water that is below standards. What is the response of the new majority in this Congress to this? To do more to clean up the Nation's water? No. The Republican response is to come up with eight different legislative riders to undermine the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act! Hard to imagine. This Republican sneak attack on the envi- ronment should not and will not go unop- posed. The American people did not vote last November to roll back 25 years of environ- mental progress. They did not vote for more pollution, or for backhanded legislative she- nanigans to undercut environmental standards just to satisfy the greed and the access paid for by many industrial polluters' campaign con- tributions. So, Mr. Chairman, during the Committee's consideration of this bill, I joined in an effort to remove the numerous provisions intended to cripple the ability of the Environmental Protec- tion Agency to perform its duties. Unfortu- nately, that effort was unsuccessful, as was my own effort to amend the bill by removing language that prohibits protection of wetlands. Later, Mr. Chairman, there will be a re- newed effort to remove these and other offen- sive and improper provisions from the bill. Un- less they are removed, and the bill is other- wise improved, this bill will not deserve the ap- proval of the House. Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Chairman, this Mem- ber rises to express his thanks to the distin- guished subcommittee chairman, Mr. L EWIS, and the distinguished ranking member, Mr. STOKES, for their efforts in bringing this bill be- fore us today. In particular, this Member wishes to express his thanks to the chairman for accommodating the concerns of this Member and many others in the manager's amendment, by increasing the bill's funding levels for several housing programs for the Department of Housing and Urban Development by approximately $300 million with appropriate offsets to meet the es- tablished budget restraints set for the sub- committee. This Congress faces serious fiscal restraints and this measure, with the adoption of the manager's amendment, faces those re- straints in an admirable way. This Member is also particularly pleased that H.R. 2099 includes $3 million in funding for the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee pro- gram at HUD. This very modest sum will guar- antee the private financing of nearly $37 mil- lion in housing loans for Indian families. As you know, Mr. Chairman, there is a severe lack of decent, affordable housing in Indian country, due in large part to the lack of private financing in Indian country. This program pro- vides a substantial means of bringing much needed private financing to Indian country. This very limited Federal funding is money well spent, and this Member commends the appropriators for including it in this measure. This Member would also like to express his appreciation for the inclusion in the bill of $8.5CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7840 July 27, 1995 million for the National Rural Water Associa- tion's training and technical assistance pro- gram which the Members had specifically re- quested of the subcommittee. In every State, on-site technical assistance is the backbone of small system compliance. Small systems have limited funds to operate and to comply with the Safe Drinking Water Act [SDWA]. Providing on-site technical assist- ance has been the most cost-effective way to improve drinking water quality in rural areas and to assist small towns with SDWA require- ments. Through technical assistance, small commu- nities work together to conduct a statewide, peer-oriented, grassroots assistance program. Small towns do not have the engineers, the labs, and the resources of large cities to meet Federal requirements. Technical assistance al- lows small communities to help each other outside of the regulatory bureaucracy, results in a growing number of small systems moving into SDWA compliance, and assures steady improvement and a long term solution to small water system public health problems. Mr. Chairman, this bill does not provide the funding levels many, including this Member, might like to see for many programs. How- ever, at a time when difficult choices are nec- essary, the crafters of this measure have at- tempted to make those choices in a respon- sible way. For that they are to be commended. Mr. KLECZKA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the VA\u00b1HUD appropria- tions legislation before this House. Mr. Chairman, many other Members have made the point that this bill goes after HUD funding with a machete instead of a scalpel. I understand the need for spending cuts, and I support eliminating programs that are wasteful or do not work. However, I would like to bring to your attention one HUD program that is effi- cient, cost-effective, and extremely nec- essary\u00d0and yet was eliminated by the Appro- priations Committee. Service coordinators were established in 1992 in response to a crisis in our Nation's public housing projects. It was at this time that financially strapped public housing managers began placing senior citizens and non-elderly disabled residents in the same housing facili- ties. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel recently reviewed the situation of the early 1990's, and I quote: Only a few years ago, frightened seniors couldn't move out fast enough from the city's 14 public housing towers and their muggings, noisy tenants, and other troubles. The conflict between the needs and life- styles of the elderly and disabled non-elderly populations in these projects was leading to mutual fear and distrust. Some of the younger residents were engaging in drug and alcohol abuse. In a few cases, violence even broke out. In 1992, Congress passed corrective legisla- tion that authorized and appropriated annual funding for service coordinators to bring the el- derly and disabled residents together and to ensure that the needs of all were met. These needs included critical transportation, nutrition, psychological counseling, and similar services. The change in the projects was dramatic. To quote the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Within months, [service coordinators] * * * had made major inroads in easing tensions, helping residents get to know one another and linking those who were sick or abusing alcohol or drugs to the help they needed.Mr. Chairman, I am deeply disturbed by the committee's decision not to fund these service coordinators. In cities like Milwaukee across the nation, service coordinators play a crucial role in maintaining a safe and healthy environ- ment for our elderly and disabled public hous- ing residents. I strongly urge my colleagues to support reinstatement of these funds in the Senate and conference committee. The CHAIRMAN. All time for general debate has expired.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] will each be recog- nized for 15 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS]. /ballot1330 Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, the manager's amendment is an attempt, working with Members of both sides of the aisle, to deal with some very specific problems while re- turning some funding to several ac- counts. Mr. Chairman, my amendment re- stores $10 million for VA health profes- sional scholarships, $64 million for VA medical care, $440.7 million for HUD's special needs housing account, $100 million for homeless assistance, and $69.6 million for credit subsidies associ- ated with two FHA multifamily loan programs. All of the costs associated with in- creasing these amounts are fully offset within the bill. To accomplish this, we have reduced FEMA's disaster relief by $85 million, and transferred moneys within salaries and expenses associated with the Federal Housing Administra- tion. Additionally, we have offset the costs associated with unobligated re- serves in the section 8 contract renewal account. The amendment also strikes two HUD administrative provisions whichhave no immediate budgetary effect in terms of our 1996 bill. We have removed provisions relating to minimum rents in public housing as well as a suspen- sion of the Brooke amendment which deals with limiting the amount of ten- ant's income which must go for rent. These changes were carefully nego- tiated with the chairs of the appro- priate authorizing committees and the leadership and leave the bill within its 602(b) allocation. I urge an affirmative vote. The prior- ities addressed by these changes should meet with your strong and bipartisan support. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the amendment of- fered by the chairman of the sub- committee [Mr. L EWIS] takes a positive step in beginning to move this bill in the right direction. In fact, the areas which he has elected to modify, and thus included in this amendment, are the very ones that I have advocated in support of since the subcommittee markup several weeks ago. Unfortu- nately, this amendment does not go far enough. While we can be pleased that an addi- tional $74 million has been added to veterans medical care\u00d0$64 million to medical care and $10 million to the Health Professions Scholarship Pro- gram\u00d0we still are nearly $200 million below the President's request in this area. We also still leave the general op- erating expenses and construction ac- counts deficient. The additional moneys in housing programs\u00d0as negligible as they are\u00d0 and also the striking of the rent in- crease provisions for public housing residents are a welcome change in this committee's actions toward HUD. Once again, the actions by the chairman mirror my recommendations to this committee for some of the areas where we could do better and an amendment that I was going to offer. It is unfortunate, however, that the amount provided in the chairman's cor- recting amendment is insignificant in terms of the overall cut to HUD. In fact, HUD still assumes nearly $5 bil- lion in cuts, after this amendment. This amendment also does not remove the very damaging rent increases to section 8 tenants or any other of the harmful legislation. I must also note a glaring omission in this amendment. That is the com- plete disregard for the devastation to EPA funding and the pages and pages of limitations and riders in this bill. I had hoped that the chairman would be more receptive to some consideration of changes in these areas. Clearly, the letters from chairmen and ranking members of numerous authorizing com- mittees and subcommittees in opposi- tion to the EPA riders tells us there needs to be a remedy for these actions. This exclusion of EPA from the amend- ment is a serious signal of the lack ofregard for environmental concerns. It also reflects a total disregard for the functions of the authorizing commit- tees having jurisdiction over environ- mental legislation in the House. I hope that as we deliberate this bill today the chairman will be more open to other amendments and recommenda- tions that are certain to be offered. I know that, if given the opportunity, we could attain both savings and provide essential quality of life programs for all Americans, as well as protect the health and welfare of our citizens. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I very much appreciate the co- operation of my ranking member. Even though this is not all that both of us may want, at least we are moving in the right direction. Mr. Chairman, it is my privilege to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO], the chairman of the subcommittee of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services that deals with housing, and a very effective and cooperative Member in establish- ing the provisions of this bill. Mr. LAZIO of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in strong support of this amendment because it is a responsible reply to the concerns of many Mem- bers. As a member of the Committee on the Budget, I supported our efforts to balance the budget. I supported the re- scission package that this body passed and will hopefully be signed by the President today. Though I support reducing the Fed- eral budget deficit, I do not support wholesale cuts to programs helping this Nation's most vulnerable popu- lations. I testified on Tuesday before the Committee on Rules on behalf of my amendment to this bill. I am pleased that my concerns and the concerns of several of my Republican colleagues have been addressed by the manager's amendment to this bill. Through this amendment, HUD's budget is returned to the postrescission funding level it had for fiscal 1995. The reason I have been so adamant over re- cent weeks to increase the funding for particular HUD programs that directly help the most vulnerable populations in our communities is that I believe cuts should be appropriate to the pro- gram. The Special Needs Account, which represents section 202 housing for the elderly, section 811 housing for the dis- abled and Housing Opportunities for Persons With AIDS, and the homeless is an account that we should not cut thoughtlessly. By restoring more than $440 million to the Special Needs Housing account in this amendment, we support our sen- ior citizens and disabled. I think it is tremendously important that we view this in the context of what is going on in another part of Washington today, the dedication of the Korean Veterans'CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7842 July 27, 1995 Memorial. The generation of Ameri- cans who brought this great Nation through the Korean war, the Second World War, and the Great Depression deserve our support. This issue is what we as a Congress are all about. The current housing stock is clearly insufficient to address the needs of America's seniors. The average senior trying to get housing through this pro- gram waits for 25 months and 15 per- cent of these seniors wait more than 4 years for housing. If we fail to help our seniors\u00d0our parents and our grand- parents\u00d0we fail all of America. If we cannot own up to our responsibility to protect them, what have we come to Congress for? This is the role for gov- ernment, helping those who cannot provide for themselves. In its original form, this bill would have cut funding for the HOPWA pro- gram, which provides decent housing for people who are debilitated by dis- ease and cannot operate in the market- place. This community needs our help. The result of a 47-percent cut in this program would be to increase home- lessness and increase the cost of care, requiring in-patient care and hospital support. This amendment returns funding for FHA's multifamily insurance pro- grams, which provide jobs and much- needed low- to moderate-income hous- ing without long-term Government subsidies. While I can appreciate the difficult funding environment that Washington is currently facing, I firmly believe that these restored funds are a wise and necessary investment of limited resources. These critically needed Fed- eral dollars will help many vulnerable low-income seniors and disabled per- sons obtain affordable housing. This amendment is about compas- sion. It is about the proper role of Gov- ernment in protecting the helpless in our society. This is an important amendment and one I think makes this bill fair to America's defenseless popu- lations. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massa- chusetts [Mr. F RANK ], a member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Commu- nity Opportunity of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I will support this amend- ment. We know the old saying that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Well, this bill is a couple of thousand miles short, and this is the single step. It is not the fault of the chairman, I believe, of the subcommittee. I think left to his own, he would have done bet- ter. But given the priorities that he had to work with, he has had to bring forward a bill that is savage in the neg- ative effect it will have on elderly poor people and others. They correct the rent increase that they wanted to give to people in public housing, but elderly people in assisted housing, elderly people in section 8,will get a significant rent increase in this. At the same time their Medicare costs will go up, and that is unworthy of us. One thing I wanted to address: We are going to be told one part of the problem here, one of the reasons HUD has to take such savage deep cuts, is that HUD has been badly run. That is true. From 1981 to 1989, under the ad- ministration of Ronald Reagan, and specifically Secretary of HUD Samuel Pierce, HUD was one of the worst run departments in the history of the Fed- eral Government. When we are at the appropriate point in the full House, I will insert into the RECORD the statement of the Independ- ent Counsel and the statement of Sam- uel Pierce which he issued when he was not indicted, and that was part, I think, of the deal, in which he said, ``I fully accept responsibility for my role in what occurred at HUD and deeply re- gret the loss of public confidence in HUD that these events may have en- tailed.'' HUD suffered grievously from the maladministration, the corrupt and in- efficient administration from 1981 to 1989 under President Reagan. Now the poor people are paying the price. It is a classic case of blaming the victim, first for the Republican Party to have trashed HUD the way it did for 8 years, and now when Secretary Cisneros is building on the efforts of Secretary Kemp, Secretary Kemp did the damage control, and Secretary Cisneros is try- ing to move ahead and be positive, and we are being told HUD will be cut enor- mously, elderly people's rents will go up, people in need will not be helped, and it is partly because of the legacy of absolute corrupt inefficiency that we inherited from the Reagan administra- tion. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from Delaware [Mr. C ASTLE ]. Mr. CASTLE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup- port of the housing provisions in the manager's amendment. I made no se- cret of the fact I am concerned about the environmental cuts and the hous- ing cuts in this particular piece of leg- islation, but I recognize, Mr. Chairman, that we must balance our budget. I supported the budget resolution and I fully understand that difficult choices have to be made to achieve our goal of balancing the budget by 2002. However, as we made the spending re- ductions needed to move to a balanced budget, these cuts must be allocated fairly. Unfortunately, I believe that housing programs have taken a dis- proportionate share of the cuts in the VA, HUD, and independent agencies ap- propriations bill. Here are the facts: The overall fund- ing for this bill is about 14 percent less than fiscal year 1995. However, HUD is receiving a 25-per- cent cut in its funding. Only EPA receives a larger cut in this bill.By contrast: The VA receives a 1-per- cent increase over 1995. NASA receives a 4-percent cut from 1995. I am not critical of these agencies at all. In fact, I support them, but the numbers speak for themselves: HUD is being cut 25 percent from the current level. Except for EPA, no other ac- count is receiving more than a 6-per- cent cut from fiscal year 1995. Having said that, I support the im- provements made in the manager's amendment. I want to thank Chairman LEWIS for working with Congressman LAZIO and those of us who believe that the original bill did not provide ade- quate funding for housing for the elder- ly, disabled, and others with special needs; as well as assistance for the homeless. I think the manager's amendment is an honest compromise. While special needs housing and homeless assistance are still receiving large reductions, this amendment does restore over $400 million for special needs housing and $100 million for homeless assistance. Mr. Chairman, the section 202 pro- gram for the construction of housing for the elderly is one of the most suc- cessful programs operated by HUD. It provides affordable housing and sup- port services for our low- and mod- erate-income seniors. There is clearly a shortage of affordable housing for the elderly and the disabled. I am pleased that the manager's amendment re- stores half of the original cut. I can tell you from personal experi- ence that the section 202 program for the elderly works and works well. These developments are boon to our low-income elderly and there are wait- ing lists for these developments when- ever they can be built. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage us all, regardless of where we stand on final passage, to support this amend- ment. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. S TUDDS ]. (Mr. STUDDS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. STUDDS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the chairman's amendment, which would restore $441 million in funding for special needs housing pro- grams. These programs include section 202 housing for the elderly and section 811 housing for disabled persons, as well as housing opportunities for peo- ple with AIDS, or HOPWA. I would like to say a few words, Mr. Chairman, about the importance of the HOPWA program. A few months ago I joined with Members on both sides of the aisle in an effort to prevent the elimination of this vital program, which provides grants to State and local governments for housing and sup- portive services for low-income individ- uals living with HIV/AIDS. In my State of Massachusetts alone, HOPWA provides over $2.5 million in formula grants for affordable housingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7843 July 27, 1995 units, supportive services, and short- term rental assistance for people living with AIDS who are in imminent danger of losing their homes. Without the funds provided by this amendment, many individuals who are fatally ill will be forced to choose be- tween essential medical care and pay- ing the rent. Some will wind up in emergency rooms; others will literally die in the streets this winter. No civilized society can allow that to happen. I commend the chairman for offering the amendment and urge its adoption. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentle- woman from Ohio [Ms. P RYCE ]. /ballot1345 Ms. PRYCE. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of the manager's amendment and commend Chairman LEWIS for his outstanding leadership, and Mr. L AZIO and his Housing Sub- committee staff for their tireless work in bringing about this compromise. This amendment includes funding to provide greatly needed housing for low- income senior citizens, the homeless, and the disabled. Also, included is budget authority to meet current mul- tifamily credit needs to transition FHA's multifamily to a self-sustaining program. Over the past 60 years, FHA multi- family insurance has provided rental homes for more than 10 million hard working families, individuals, and the elderly. In Ohio alone, the FHA multi- family program has helped renovate or build more than 26,000 affordable rental units. Mr. Chairman, the need for affordable rental housing is tremendous, and in setting our priorities with our limited resources, we must not forget our el- derly, our vulnerable, our homeless, our disabled, the ill, and those most in need. This is responsible legislation, it's the proper role of government, and I urge my colleagues to support this important perfecting amendment. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York [Mr. S CHUMER ]. Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman for yield- ing time to me. I want to commend the chairman, the ranking member, as well as the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO], the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. SHAYS ], the gentlewoman from Califor- nia [Ms. P ELOSI ], and the other Mem- bers who were instrumental in adding money for AIDS housing and housing for the elderly. We in New York have a staggering number of people with AIDS who face one of three choices. They can live on the streets. That is not very accept- able, to die of AIDS on the street. They can live in acute care hospitals. That treats them well, but it is extremely expensive, $1,085 a day, according to the Massachusetts Insurance Rate Set- ting Commission.Or they can live in a HOPWA group home at the cost of about $40 to $100 a day. It is the humane way to go, and it is also the cheaper way to go. That is why I am very grateful. I was one of the original authors of HOPWA on the housing committee. I am very grateful that the committee has made room for HOPWA, but my gratefulness is meaningless compared to those who will need this housing and use it. It has been a big success in New York. I also want to say we are desperately short of 202 housing, and the fact that this will increase 202 is another benefit. I urge support of the en bloc amend- ment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. F RELINGHUYSEN ]. (Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN asked and was given permission to revise and ex- tend his remarks.) Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in support of the amend- ment. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Chairman LEWIS' amendment to reprioritize some of the housing programs and to add more funding for the special needs housing programs which consolidates the housing construction pro- grams for people with disabilities, the elderly, and AIDS housing. In addition the amendment adds more funding for the homeless housing program and the Multifamily Credit Subsidy Program. I am pleased to be a part of this com- promise agreement reached between Chair- man LEWISand the chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, Mr. L AZIO. While I agree that the Department of Housing and Urban Devel- opment is in drastic need of downsizing and consolidation, I was concerned about the re- duction in the special needs program. By adopting the Lewis amendment we will be sending a clear message to the bureau- crats at HUD that Congress is willing to sup- port programs that work like the section 202 and section 811 programs. Both of these pro- grams have a proven track record and I am pleased that this amendment addresses the successes of these two programs. This amendment will also address the multi- family credit subsidy program. Here again, I believe that we need to find ways to revise the operation of the current multifamily programs, so that it can become self-sustaining without a federally appropriated subsidy. However, in the interim and lacking a new authorization, Congress needs to continue this program be- cause if targets the people who are most in need. Again, I urge my colleagues to adopt the Lewis amendment and make these construc- tive changes to the VA, HUD, and independ- ent agencies appropriations bill. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle- woman from New Jersey [Mrs. R OU- KEMA ]. Mrs. ROUKEMA. Mr. Chairman, I do want to rise in support of this man- ager's amendment. As has been stated, we are attending to the seniors, the disabled, and the AIDS sufferers.I also wanted to point out that there is clarification necessary here because all too often there has been reference made to the fact that we are increasing the rental costs and suspending the Brooks amendment. That is not true. In this manager's amendment, we are restoring the ceiling on the rental lev- els, not only for public housing ten- ants, which is extremely important, but I would hope that my colleague from California, [Ms. W ATERS ] would understand also that the ceiling of 30 percent is retained not only on public housing but also on the senior citizens and the disabled. So we are not ravaging the poorest, in terms of their rental costs. I think there has been a widespread misunder- standing bout this. I also would want to say that as one who worked on the rental housing re- forms of last year with the gentle- woman from California [Ms. W ATERS ], we are not abandoning that. They are maintained, those reforms are main- tained in this legislation. Mr. Chairman, I want to say that as the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. PRYCE ] has said, a very important part of this manager's amendment, which has thus far been ignored, is the FHA multifamily credit subsidy. We are im- proving that. We are working toward reform. This is an essential component of a private-public partnership that is essential to meet our multifamily needs. Further I would like to clarify for Ms. W A- TERS: I share your concern with the increase from 30 to 32 percent for the section 8 Ten- ant-Based Program. However, this does not apply to the Public Housing Program. Nor does it apply to 202 elderly or disabled. More- over, I am pleased that the bill does include the public housing rent reforms we worked on last year along with Representative KNOLLENBERG . Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. V ENTO ]. (Mr. VENTO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I must say that on balance I think it does more good than harm. It is basi- cally a pea and shell game, what is played here, in terms of what is funded. I think it deals with the short term types of needs, so I guess we have to take care of some of that, but only some of them. It restores, instead of underfunding, McKinney and FEMA by 50 percent. We now only underfund it by 40 percent in this amendment. So those are the types of priorities that, in other words, we are going to do less in 1996 than we are doing in 1995. While that problem persists, it still maintains rent increases for those in some of the assisted housing programs. It is really trying to buy votes to se- cure support in terms of those that want to show that they are makingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7844 July 27, 1995 some move improving a bad bill. I com- mend them for the pressure they ex- erted, but frankly it falls far short of where we have to go. It is, I think, an indication of where the priorities are in this new Congress that have to be addressed in terms of where the dollars are going to end up. The amendment with the underline bill simply provides a little more legislate a little bit less than otherwise would be the case. It tries to basically buy off on the cheap in terms of this bill some reluc- tant supporters. It just does not go far enough, as my colleague from Massa- chusetts said. The journey begins with the first step, but we have got many miles to go before we get back to where we belong. We have a responsibility, I think a moral responsibility, Mr. Chairman, to stand up for those that are vulnerable, those working families in our commu- nities that are trying to make it. That is why we are here on the floor today, we Democrats, we want to stand up for those folks that in fact need our rep- resentation. They are not represented by the PAC's and the others, but they need our help and that of the House. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York [Mr. N ADLER ]. (Mr. NADLER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the manager's amendment that would increase the Special Needs Housing block grant by $441 million, providing for the restoration of crucial funding to the Housing Opportunities for People with AIDS [HOPWA], sec- tion 202, and section 811. Mr. Chairman, at a time when home- lessness has reached crisis proportions and when so many very crucial pro- grams that provide desperately needed services are being chipped away, one by one, we must work to preserve ade- quate funding for these important housing programs which are key to the basic existence of so many Americans. The HOPWA program provides com- munity-based, cost-effective housing for people living with AIDS and their families. AIDS is now the leading killer of Americans between the ages of 25 and 44. At any given time, one-third to one- half of all Americans with AIDS are ei- ther homeless or in imminent danger of losing their homes. We have a respon- sibility, not only to respond to this very devastating public health crisis, but to provide assistance to those who are suffering from AIDS. This amendment is cost-efficient and will save funds that would, in the ab- sence of the housing and services pro- vided in a HOPWA-funded residential facility, result in higher expenditures for hospital or emergency room costs. The costs of HOPWA facilities are be- tween one-tenth and one-twentieth of the costs of hospital or emergency rooms. In fact, it is estimated thatHOPWA dollars reduce the use of emer- gency health care services by an esti- mated $47,000 per person, per year. Sections 202 and 811 have also proven to be enormously valuable programs, which have provided thousands from our growing senior population and peo- ple with disabilities with affordable housing, independence, and security. Without these valuable programs so many risk homelessness, and, quite possibly, premature death due to expo- sure to poor nutrition, stress, and lack of medical care. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is so- cially, morally, and fiscally respon- sible. I urge my colleagues to support it. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Q UINN]. Mr. QUINN. Mr. Chairman, I, too, want to rise in support of the man- ager's amendment today and to thank the gentleman from California [Mr. LEWIS] and the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO] and so many others across the aisle that have worked so hard to come up with this compromise. I think it takes a great step in the right direction. Mr. Chairman, we are talking about some big numbers, 19.1 to 19.4 billion. We talk later on in the bill about $600 and $300 million. The key though is back in our districts where we know it works. I recently visited a facility run by People, Inc., a not-for-profit. It takes these funds and makes sure that disabled and handicapped citizens are used properly in the right direction. I think that when we look back at our directions in our home States and towns and districts, we can see that this money works. Seniors, homeless vets, and others, it works. While there are some criticisms, we know that these big, big number we talk about here on the floor and in and out of committees, back in our dis- tricts where we have a chance to see it right away in action, we know that this money is put to its best use. I con- gratulate all the Members who worked for the manager's amendment and urge its support later on this afternoon. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massa- chusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ]. (Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to re- vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I think that if Jesus Christ were watching this particular amend- ment on the House floor, he would look down at us and think that this was a poor attempt to imitate his miracle of the loaves and fishes. The fact of the matter is that we are trying to play a shell game here. We are trying to pretend that we are cut- ting off an arm and sewing back a fin- ger and saying that everybody should be thankful for the efforts that have been put into it. The reality is that we are cutting this budget, we are cutting the housingbudget by billions and billions of dol- lars without a single hearing. We go about this by cutting $400 million out of the homeless budget. We put $100 million back, bringing it to a $400 mil- lion cut, and everybody is supposed to kneel down and say, thank you very much. The fact of the matter is that, if we are interested in ending homelessness in America, we have to invest in build- ing housing for folks. This country did not have homeless people in it in the 1960's and the 1970's and the like be- cause we built affordable housing. Since Ronald Reagan's time, we have cut affordable housing and we have seen the rise of homelessness. If we are serious about ending these issues, if we are serious about doing something about the plight of so many millions of Americans that live in pub- lic housing, we want to take a snapshot of some politician in front of a public housing project, that is great. And we condemn the whole thing. Or we are dealing with the fact that the vast ma- jority of public housing is very good housing, and we need to continue to in- vest in it. But by coming along and chopping it off, what we are going to do is go about creating the very public housing disas- ters that Members so adroitly con- demn. So let us deal with the problems. Let us support this amendment, be- cause it does a little bit more, and we cannot carry the votes to kill this whole bill. But let us recognize that what we need to do is kill this bill, put the funds into affordable housing. Cut the B\u00b12, cut the taxes, not for the rich but for ordinary citizens. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from Connecticut [Mr. S HAYS ]. Mr. SHAYS. Mr. Chairman, I have been wrestling with this bill for a long time and wrestling with what we are about as Members of Congress. I know that we have bankrupted this nation because of the kind of rhetoric of my colleague from Massachusetts who somehow thinks that if we spend more money we help people. I think that in a hearing that my subcommittee is going to have in Chi- cago, we are going to have a hearing in Chicago because the Federal Govern- ment had to take over public housing because it has totally failed. A 4-mile stretch, one side a throughway and the other side 4 miles of public housing, and the poverty rate is 15 percent of the official poverty rate. So I have come to the general conclu- sion that 12-year-old girls having ba- bies and 14-year-olds selling drugs and 15-year-olds killing each other, 18-year- olds who cannot read their diplomas, 24-year-olds who have never had a job, 30-year-old grandparents is the legacy of this welfare state that must change. We are going to change it. But this amendment, the fine work of the gentleman from New York [Mr. LAZIO], the fine work of the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], the fineCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7845 July 27, 1995 work of some Members on this side who weighed in and have helped rescue a certain part of this bill to restore some funding for senior housing that works, for HOPWA that I know works, housing opportunities for people with AIDS and for helping those who are disabled to restore some money in the homeless is to me a gigantic step in the right direc- tion. /ballot1400 I do not have all the answers, Mr. Chairman. I just know we have failed miserably, and I know it is not going to be solved by a lot more money. Hopefully we will get beyond the kind of rhetoric that we just heard and start to interact with people to make sure the money we do appropriate actually means something and does some good. Mr. Chairman, I salute the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] again, and the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO], and Members on both sides of the aisle who recognize that we have failed miserably, and we need to put a new and complete face on hous- ing. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO ]. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I appre- ciate the gentleman yielding time to me. My friend, the gentleman from Con- necticut [Mr. S HAYS ], who was talking about assisted and public housing, has left the floor. I just wanted to point out that I think that most of us recog- nize that there are problems with some assisted and public housing, as the gen- tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K EN- NEDY ] said on the floor, and that there are troubled housing authorities. These constantly are held up as the basis for not continuing housing program. Mr. Chairman, the fact of the matter is that in my community, I would wel- come the Congress to focus on the pro- grams that are working very well. We have public housing that is 40 and 50 years old, that is being renewed in terms of contracts that represent some of the best quality housing for our low- income members of the community and working families, and it is serving its purpose. To be sure, any time we have that kind of concentration in terms of public housing\u00d0in some areas miles of low-income high rises\u00d0most of us rec- ognize those political decisions that concentrate these tremendous numbers of low-income individuals in housing projects in large urban centers, and across the country. Such planning, such architecture causes a big prob- lem\u00d0a very big problem. However, Mr. Chairman, I think that this particular bill is denying mod- ernization and operating funds for all public housing across the board. These policies are going to affect the good, the bad, and the indifferent, and I think we need to focus. We do not want to see more public housing have the type of plight that has happened in theexample that has been given by my col- league, the gentleman from Connecti- cut [Mr. S HAYS ]. However, that is ex- actly what is going to happen. What is really I think the problem in this bill, Mr. Chairman, is that it fails to help us preserve the existing re- sources of 4.7 million public and as- sisted housing units that we have. We are going to see a further deterioration of such housing. The money in the pipeline is necessary and useful for maintenance and operating in a fair way, and maintaining that housing. Mr. STOKES. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the comments made by the gentleman from Minnesota, and they echo my own views in terms of that subject. I would just say in closing, Mr. Chairman, that while I commend the chairman for his effort to improve the bill in this direction, and he certainly has improved it to some degree, it cer- tainly has not gone as far as is really necessary to try and correct this legis- lation and make it palatable. It is un- fortunate that we are in that position; and my position, of course, would have to be that until we can clear up these other matters in this bill, this is a bill which I would have to oppose. Mrs. MORELLA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in sup- port of the chairman's en bloc amendment. The program funding that is restored in this amendment affects individuals who do not have alternative resources. It is critical that we approve this amendment to restore at least a minimal level of funding for our most vulner- able communities. Perhaps we have difficulty imagining our- selves in our seventies, eighties, or older. Do we think that because we have reasonable re- sources now, that a major illness, accident, or just a very long life could not wipe out our seeming financial security? How can we refuse to assume responsibility for minimum care, in this case just providing shelter for the elderly, for those living with HIV/AIDS, for the disabled, and for the homeless. I don't think any of us can, in good faith. This amendment restores $441 million for HUD special needs housing and in addition, it strikes the provision requiring section 8 rental assistance recipients to pay additional utility costs. I have great concern with the bill's pro- vision which pegs assistance to the market- place. In Montgomery County, MD, this poten- tially could result in more than 3,500 section 8 recipients being forced to live in areas of con- centrated poverty. Mr. Chairman, I do not believe that this Congress really could accept a 49-percent re- duction in the McKinney Homeless Assistance Program which has been a tremendous bene- fit to all communities. We still know little about how to meet our Nation's increase in the num- ber of homeless, but it is a tragedy that must be addressed and we have a program that has proved itself over the years. Nor can we turn our backs on our seniors and the disabled who must depend on a fixed income and many of whom have no where else to turn. My county's housing opportunity commis- sion was recently lauded by Secretary Cisneros when he said: ``Montgomery County, MD, may have the Nation's most comprehen- sive and balanced local housing program.'' Itis important to remember that this success is dependent on, and in cooperation with, Fed- eral support for ``special need'' housing pro- grams. Assistance for such housing is needed in all areas of the country and every jurisdic- tion. No community can carry it alone. Another program addressed by the amend- ment is the Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS [HOPWA] Program, the only Fed- eral housing program that specifically address- es the housing needs of people with HIV/ AIDS. It is estimated that one-third to one-half of all people with AIDS are either homeless or on the verge of losing their homes. Many peo- ple with AIDS are still faced with eviction be- cause of discrimination, despite Federal and State antidiscrimination laws. Many others lose their homes when they are no longer able to pay their mortgage or rent because of ill- ness and lost wages. Still others are already homeless when they become ill. Despite these problems, people living with HIV/AIDS histori- cally have encountered great obstacles in re- ceiving assistance through Federal housing programs. HOPWA was created to address this des- perate need, giving communities the flexibility to develop a broad range of housing options and support services to meet their specific needs, consistent with this Congress' efforts to provide greater local control. Without adequate resources for HOPWA, people with HIV/AIDS will die early and with- out dignity\u00d0in emergency rooms, shelters, or worse\u00d0in the streets alone. This amendment ensures that at least a minimal amount of funding is available to provide housing for people with HIV/AIDS to ensure that they can live out the remainder of their lives with some level of decency and comfort. Mr. Chairman, the cuts that have been cho- sen for H.R. 2099 are inhumane. We can do better than to take from the most vulnerable among us. This amendment is a fair and rea- sonable effort to restore basic housing needs, and I urge its adoption. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STOKES. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I appreciate the gentleman yield- ing to me. I have no further speakers on this side. It is not my intention to ask for any more time. Indeed, I would hope that we could go to a voice vote on this, because buses are going to the Korean war memorial service. I cer- tainly appreciate the cooperation of the ranking member in this matter. Mr. STOKES. We are pleased to co- operate with the chairman in that re- gard. We do not see a need for a record vote on this particular amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield back the balance of my time.

PERMISSION FOR MEMBER TO OFFER AMENDMENT OUT OF ORDER Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 34 offered by the gen- tleman from Oregon [Mr. D EFAZIO] to title I be in order at a later point in the reading of the bill, notwithstanding that title I may have been closed. This has been agreed upon by both sides of the issue in terms of the Mem- bers debating it.The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the chairman of the sub- committee, the gentleman from Cali- fornia [Mr. L EWIS]. Mr. Chairman, the report of the Sub- committee on VA, HUD, and Independ- ent Agencies of the Committee on Ap- propriations contains language that highlights the excellent work con- ducted by the EPA in the use of a heli- copter for water quality testing along the New York-New Jersey coasts. The EPA established a water quality test- ing program due to the pollution prob- lems experienced that year by New Jer- sey and New York in the beaches which they experienced in 1988. As Members may recall, this was front page news which caused people to stay away from our beaches. This problem could have done irreparable harm to the economy, but with the cooperation of the Fed- eral, State, and local governments, a comprehensive plan was implemented to ensure that the ocean water quality would never be in the sad shape that we found it in 1988. Since 1988, we have made steady progress in making our coastal waters clean. There are two critical elements to the EPA's water quality testing pro- gram. First is the spotting of floatables in the coastal waters, and the second is the actual monitoring and surveying of water quality. In both situations, the EPA utilizes a helicopter to conduct its work. I want to clarify the committee re- port language. The committee lan- guage discusses the spotting and imme- diate cleanup of floatables, but does not specify or mention monitoring and surveying of water quality. I ask the subcommittee chairman if the intent of the committee language includes the monitoring and surveying of water quality, in addition to the spotting of floatables? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SAXTON. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, yes, the committee realizes that the water quality testing program which has been instrumental in solving the coastal water problems which New Jersey experienced in 1987 and 1988 should continue. As the gentleman stated, this program includes spotting of floatables and monitoring and sur- veying of water quality. Mr. SAXTON. Reclaiming my time, would the chairman of the subcommit- tee explain what funds are available to continue this program? Mr. LEWIS of California. It is the committee's intention that the funds come for this program from EPA's en- vironmental program and compliance account. Mr. SAXTON. Mr. Chairman, I appre- ciate the willingness of the chairmanof the subcommittee to include this language in the committee report. This program is vital to New Jersey and I want to commend the gentleman for his excellent work as chairman of the subcommittee. AMENDMENT NO . 50 OFFERED BY MR . OBEY Mr. OBEY.

The gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. O BEY] will be rec- ognized for 30 minutes, and the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] will be recognized for 30 minutes in op- position to the amendment. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. O BEY]. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, this amendment sim- ply cuts out the money for the space station, cuts the deficit by almost half a billion in the process, and transfers the rest of the unused money from the station into veterans' health care, into housing for the elderly and low-income and disabled, and to other science, es- pecially other nonstation NASA science. Mr. Chairman, like anybody else, I am thrilled by the history of the space program. I was at the launch when Neal Armstrong went to the Moon. It was one of the most thrilling experi- ences of my life and, I suspect, that ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7849 July 27, 1995 every other American who witnessed it. However, these times require very tough choices. Some of those choices in this bill and a variety of other bills, are being avoided, rather than made. The result, I am afraid, is going to be severe constriction of our scientific ca- pability, as well as a warping of our na- tional priorities. Mr. Chairman, the space station is sold as science, and I suppose, in some ways, it is, but there are two kinds of science which are funded by Govern- ment. One is investigator-initiated science in which a scientist gets an idea, he applies for a grant, other sci- entists review that proposal, and, be- cause we have limited funding, only the science which is judged to be the very best is actually approved for Fed- eral financing. This is, I think, quite different science. Much of it, though certainly not all of it, Mr. Chairman, is what I would call politically generated science. It is, in many ways, a political project which has been redesigned countless times. And I do not mean to use the word ``po- litical'' in a denigrating way. I happen to have great respect for the terms ``politician'' and ``public servant.'' Without politics, societies have wars, so I have great respect for political de- cisions. However, I think there comes a point when we have to ask by which process we will learn the most and gain the most to advance this country scientif- ically. I think in many ways this project, desireable though it might be if we had additional resources, I think it is in many ways a public works dem- onstration project. Its supporters will talk about it in terms of the scientific payoff it can have. I think the question is: What knowledge will we gain through the expenditure of money for the station versus what kind of knowl- edge we will gain if we put that money to use in other scientific endeavors. Mr. Chairman, the cost of this sta- tion is supposed to be, when we count up what has been spent and what will be spent, about $94 billion, $75 billion yet to be spent. To put that in perspec- tive, that is about $4 billion a year; on average, that represents about twice as much as we spend annually on cancer research. It is more than we spend in the entire NASA or NSF budget, and it will not buy, in my view, 94 billion dol- lars' worth of new information. It will finance, to a very large extent, repeated performances of functions that we already know how to do. It will finance 73 additional shuttle flights, at least, to carry into space very large amounts of material and equipment which will be assembled by workers floating around the globe. I would de- scribe that as being, say, 90 percent a large-scale construction project and 10 percent a science project. My percent- ages may be off, but I think Members get my general drift. Mr. Chairman, my concern at the sci- entific level, and because I have re- sponsibility wearing my other hat as amember of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education, where we fund all NIH research, for instance, I have great concern that, because of the budget squeeze, this station is going to squeeze out other science in our Fed- eral budget. We are going to have addi- tional budget cuts next year. Everybody knows that, no matter what decisions we make this year. I think if we keep the station, that over time, because of the declining level of Federal spending vis-a-vis previous plans, we will in essence obliterate our ability to support a lot of other needed science. /ballot1415 If I can keep just for the moment on the scientific issue, by passing this amendment, I think you help us to save other NASA science, you help us to fully fund Mission to Planet Earth, or virtually fully fund it at its re- quested level, and in addition to, I think, improving the balance of science that these dollars would produce, you allow us to restore $400 million to help the elderly and the disabled get decent housing here on Earth and, frankly, those of you who know me, know that I would, any time, put decent habitat for people on the face of the Earth ahead of habitat for astronauts. In addition this amendment would allow us to restore $400 million to vet- erans' health, including correcting the problem which we have in the bill which will if not corrected squeeze the benefits of about 12,000 veterans, many of whom suffer from illness who will have their disability payments reduced because of the legislative provisions in this bill. This will allow us to try to correct that. It will also, in addition, give us a bonus of an additional almost $500 million savings on the Federal def- icit. It seems to me that this is the ra- tional thing to do given our budget squeeze. One the veterans' side, for instance. The bill before us delays funding for $750 million in medical equipment in our veterans' medical centers around the country. This would enable us to meet some of the shortfall in the veter- ans' funding area. I really believe it represents a far better balance in ex- penditures. I want to say this to those who have had a strong commitment to the sta- tion in the past. I understand that and I respect it. If this were the world that existed back in the 1960's when Presi- dent Kennedy first began the space pro- gram, if we had an economy that was expanding at that rate, if we had re- sources which were expected to expand, if we did not have a poverty situation which was increasing, if we did not have a degenerating housing situation, if we did not have desperate needs in the environmental area, I would not be here offering this. But we have in the 1980's seen a huge run up in public debt because of policies which I largely op- posed but nonetheless they were adopt-ed and rammed through here over our objection, and those things have con- sequences. The consequence of those decisions in the early 1980's is that we have such a huge overhang of public debt, we are now being forced to make choices which squeeze out a good many valuable programs. The choices we face here is whether or not we will squeeze this one out or whether we will pretend for a while that we can continue it, meanwhile watching it every day gob- ble up other essential pieces of the budget, including other pieces of the science budget. I respect people who differ with me on this issue, and I know that this of- fers people tough choices, but we are paid to make those tough choices. I think we ought to begin on this one today. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, first I want to express my appreciation to the gentleman from Wisconsin for cooperating relative to the time difficulties that we have. While we have much agreement, there is some disagreement regarding this amendment. It is suggested by way of the author's recommendation that there is some cost to go in terms of our space station completion and operation, somewhere around $94 million. According to NASA's evaluation, the dollar figures really should be $26.2 bil- lion including $13.2 billion for final de- velopment and construction and $13 billion for 10 years of operation. Setting that aside, it really is no small bit of irony that we are consider- ing an amendment here today that would eliminate space station funding. It was just last evening that I had the privilege of being at the White House where the President was giving a medal to Comdr. Jim Lovell, one of our best known and most talented and success- ful astronauts. The effect of this amendment in the final analysis would do two things that I would suggest are very, very impor- tant for all Members to consider: First, the amendment would eliminate space station and thereby all those flight op- erations that relate to space station. It would undermine the President's effort to further develop an international co- operative effort between friends in Eastern Europe as well as with Russia. There are those suggesting that if you eliminate space station, then in some way that money is suddenly going to become available for any num- ber of other priorities. I would suggest the latter is a total misconception of what would likely occur. It is my view that NASA's support flows around the public's interest in man's space flight, the public's interest in station. Indeed, if we eliminate those programs, it is my view that NASA would all but be eliminated it- self. To presume that with the other priorities that we see in this bill, suchCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7850 July 27, 1995 as housing, such as veterans, such as EPA, that suddenly a huge flow of dol- lars would be available for scientific research and other science programs, some would suggest is at least a bit naive. This amendment would kill space station. In my judgment it would kill NASA's total program. Indeed it would terminate our American mission in space. I urge a ``no'' vote on the amend- ment. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. F OGLI- ETTA ]. Mr. FOGLIETTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise to speak in favor of the Obey amendment. This is a summer when all of us are thrilled by recalling the ad- venture of Apollo 13. It was one of the milestones in the challenge John Ken- nedy put to America. We needed the challenge and we could afford that challenge. But that was then and this is now. Now is a time when we need to make our public housing programs better\u00d0 and this administration is trying. But we need to continue a Federal commit- ment to housing for the most vulner- able people in our society. Now is not a time when we can re- nege on our commitment to the men and women who fought our wars. Now is a time when we have to make genuine efforts to control our deficit. We have to be credible and fair in this effort. Now is not a time when we can afford the space station. The challenges that face us today are very different than the ones that confronted us in the 1960's of John Kennedy and Apollo 13. There are so many things that trou- ble me about this bill. It is so mean- spirited in so many ways. As chairman of the Congressional Urban Caucus, I am distressed at the harshly anticity, antipoor, antiveteran, antienvironment aspects of this bill. How can we make it better? Throw it out and start over again. But Mr. OBEY'Samendment does a good job in pointing out the inequities of the bill, as well as its departure from genuine and fair deficit reduction. I urge my colleagues to support the Obey amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gentle- woman from California [Mrs. SEASTRAND ]. Mrs. SEASTRAND. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the amend- ment and give my support for full fund- ing of the international space station Alpha. On the one hand we will hear from opponents that budget cutters have cut far too deeply into the NASA budget and that those cuts severely imperil the U.S. space program. On the other hand we hear opponents cite a flawedGAO study that says the space station is going to cost $94 billion and we should just do away with it. Well, I believe both arguments are in- correct and wrong. The space station represents Ameri- ca's future in the development of space. In the Science Committee, under the leadership of B OBWALKER and J IMSEN- SENBRENNER , we have gone to great lengths to make certain that the space station will progress in a responsible, fiscally competent, efficient, and on- schedule fashion for the next 7 years. If that were not the case I would not support the program. In a time when we are scaling back, tightening, and eliminating, some ask how we can allocate full funding for the station. The answer, quite simply, is that the station is an investment in America's future. Are we going to lead the way in space or are we going to watch others from the sidelines? Are we going to lead the way in space-based research or will our citizens have to wait for medical progress? Are we going to lead the way in sending products into space or will we be forced to buy services from the other nations who stayed involved with the station? The space station is very much about America's future. In fact, it is a path- way into the future. In the Science Committee, we recognize this reality and embrace it. We can see the com- mercial possibilities sand the necessity for America to be competitive. We can do this and keep our commit- ment to balance the budget. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from California [Mr. B ROWN ], the ranking member of the Committee on Science. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from California [Mr. B ROWN ]. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from California [Mr. B ROWN ] is recog- nized for 7 minutes. (Mr. BROWN of California asked and was given permission to revise and ex- tend his remarks.) Mr. BROWN of California. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY] and the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. L EWIS] for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I think beyond ques- tion the remarks I make here today and the vote that I cast on this amend- ment will rank amongst the most dif- ficult that I have ever had to make. I have come to the conclusion that we can no longer sustain a space pro- gram of the type that I would like to see and which has been recommended by all of the experts in this field, at the budget level which we are now con- fronted with, and that as a con- sequence I will have to oppose the space station. I have this chart here which will en- able me to explain the budgetary situa- tion. I have had this chart for a num- ber of years. I used it for the last cou-ple of years to try and tell the Presi- dent that we could not continue the space program and the space station at the level of his budget. I have now re- vised it to include the Republican budget as well, which I find makes the President's budget look good. When I came to Congress, NASA's budget was here. I came in the early 1960's. The Republican budget at the end of a 5-year period will bring us back to less than it was in the early 1960's. The President's budget would allow us to do slightly better but not too much. Five years ago, President Bush com- missioned a report on the future of the space program. This was at this point right here on the chart. The commis- sion was chaired by the present chair- man of Martin Marietta and composed of distinguished citizens and scientists. At that point the commission rec- ommended that to maintain all of the programs NASA was supporting, in- cluding the space station, it would be necessary to continue this upward curve, up to about here. At this point, it would equal about half in terms of GNP what it was over here. Instead of following the rec- ommendations of that report, what ac- tually happened was just the opposite. We have tried to maintain all of those programs in NASA's portfolio with a budget which is less than half of what was recommended by that report. Here is when the present adminis- trator, Mr. Goldin, came in. /ballot1430 He was appointed by Mr. Bush, told to streamline NASA, to cut the budget, to use all of the necessary techniques, including reductions of the bureauc- racy, and redesign of programs to achieve the NASA Program goals, but at considerably less money. Here we are today, and Mr. Goldin has done one of the most magnificent jobs that I have ever seen a Govern- ment employee do and he has main- tained the level of the programs and cut the overall budget by 15 percent. Here is where we are. Where do we go from here? In my opinion, we can con- tinue to make modest cuts and con- tinue all of these programs, but we cannot go as far as the President rec- ommends, which amounts to a 30-per- cent cut from where Mr. Goldin start- ed, nor can we do what the Republican budget includes, which is a 40-percent cut. Mr. Chairman, in other words we are proposing to cut the budget for NASA almost in half over a period of years, and to still finish what we have done. The gentleman from California [Mr. LEWIS], the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee, a very astute gen- tleman, recognized in his original sub- committee report that they could not do that, so the gentleman proposed cutting out a number of major science programs and three major installa- tions. The gentleman will have to do that again next year, and it will carryCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7851 July 27, 1995 next year, because there is no way to continue with NASA. So I am suggesting to all of my col- leagues that we need to take a fun- damental look of where we want to be in space. We are about to see the col- lapse of all of our cooperative efforts, including the space station, because we do not now have adequate reserves to guarantee us against the unexpected in the remaining 5 years of that program. Our allies in Europe, with whom I keep in fairly close touch, including this morning, our allies in Japan, our allies in Canada, are questioning whether we can continue these pro- grams on this kind of a budget trajec- tory, and they are correct, and they are likely to leave the ship in the very near future. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. BROWN of California. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I certainly appreciate both the interest of the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. B ROWN ] in the work of NASA and also the gentleman's chart, be- cause it reflects many of the frustra- tions that I share with the gentleman. One of our problems has been that NASA's financing begins in our Sub- committee on Appropriations. There is no question that funding competing with housing and veterans' programs has competed with NASA. On the other hand I have argued that the only hope that NASA really has to get continued support within the House is the mission in space. That is how we developed the broadly based bipartisan support that NASA has had so far. Frankly, without space station, I think all of that disappears. Mr. BROWN of California. Mr. Chair- man, I happen to agree with the gen- tleman. I think NASA's programs will begin to unravel if we end the space station. On the other hand, we are now headed on a trajectory which will leave us at a level of expenditure of two- tenths of 1 percent of the Gross Na- tional Product at that point. Up here we were eight-tenths of national GNP. Now, we all say we give NASA a high priority. Wonderful program, great science, great adventure, very stimu- lating. And then we give it less re- sources than any other part of the do- mestic discretionary programs; less than any other science; less certainly than nonscience aspects of the budget. Of course, you can compare it with defense which continues to go up, even though we do not have any realistic wars in the near term. We are not giv- ing NASA the priority which we all say that it ought to have, and it will col- lapse. Mr. Chairman, I told the President this last year. I said, ``Your budget this year will survive. The programs could continue, but the 5-year outlook, it cannot.'' I said, ``I will vote for the space station this year, if you will work hard to keep it a half a billion dollars. Last year they gave the Presi-dent more than he asked for; a good sign. This year the President did not reex- amine the 5-year outlook. I am not going to support it under these condi- tions and I continue to point out that we are lying in our teeth if we say space is important and then give it this kind of a budget. Mr.Chairman, Irisetoday to statemy overall dismay over the events that have led us to consider this amendment today. In 1990, then-President Bush brought together the Na- tion's wisest and most knowledgeable experts on the space program to review the future di- rection we should take. At that time the con- cern centered around NASA's ability to sustain major efforts such as the space station and the space shuttle program and still carry out its basic missions in science and space explo- ration. This panel, called the Augustine Commis- sion, produced a report remarkable for its in- sight and vision. One of the most notable rec- ommendations was that the scope and direc- tion of our Nation's space program must be accompanied by a stable budget\u00d0a budget that at least keeps pace with inflation. If we truly have as our objective the expansion of human presence in space, the budget must some day reach a level approaching about half what it was during the Apollo years ac- cording to the Augustine report. Scarcely had the Augustine report been re- leased than Congress and the administration embarked on a fierce competition to cut the NASA budget. Over the past 5 years, there seems to be no cut large enough to satisfy the budget cutting frenzy in both the Congress and the executive branch. The most recent re- duction by the White House\u00d0a $5 billion cut over 5 years\u00d0was doubled by the Republican budget resolution. This mimics some kind of high stakes poker game in which the losers will be not only NASA, but our future genera- tions. Over the past 5 years, as this scenario has unfolded, I have agonized over how best to call attention to this fantasy that NASA funding is a bottomless pit\u00d0that we can cut indefi- nitely and still expect to keep major NASA centers open, still keep major programs afloat, and still keep the public confidence in our stewardship of NASA. Today, I have reluctantly reached the con- clusion that this fantasy is no longer plausible. I see no juncture this year, nor in the future at which leaders in Congress and the White House will reverse this trend or reach a con- sensus on the need for a stable long-term NASA budget. Thus I plan today to vote to ter- minate the space station. This is a very painful decision for me\u00d0but I have no other morally acceptable choice. In saying this I want to give my highest ac- colades to NASA and to Administrator Goldin who has struggled to meet the demands of OMB to cut back, and his strong voice against the further reductions proposed by the Repub- licans. NASA has made Congress's job vastly easier by forging ahead on reforms, by pro- posing rational ways to reduce spending and absorb the cuts levied by OMB and by return- ing the space program to the American peo- ple. It is profoundly unfair to ignore the solid work already done and replace it with the vague, misguided policy directives that mas- querade these days for budget cuts\u00d0policy di-rectives to go forth and privatize, commer- cialize and so on. These are no more than buzz words, indeed buzz words that nobody can even agree on. I have been and will remain a strong sup- porter of the space station. But the Republican budget plan and the lack of leadership in the White House on space issues leaves me no choice but to point out that NASA cannot re- main a viable agency and cannot sustain a viable space station program within the budg- etary envelope that has been put forward by the Republicans. I tried to make this point last year that the President's own 5-year budget plan would not sustain a balanced NASA program as well as the space station, but I was obviously unsuc- cessful in convincing them. I fully recognize that the amendment which I will vote for will, if passed, put NASA overall in worse shape. The amendment that should be considered today is one that will restore the cuts that have been made to NASA in this bill and to bring it back to at least the level in the President's request in fiscal year 1996 and to maintain stability thereafter by keeping pace with inflation. There is no doubt that that amendment will fail miserably. I will close by restating that my vote today represents my personal position and I do not necessarily ask that my colleagues join me. I hope, however, that my colleagues in this and future Congresses will join me in focussing on this important problem and lending their genu- ine support to the space program. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 3 minutes to the gen- tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. S ENSEN - BRENNER ]. Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chair- man, I rise in opposition to the Obey amendment and in opposition to the misguided priorities represented in it. Mr. Chairman, the money that we spend on NASA can never be justified in the abstract. But where it can be justified is in the spinoffs that our in- vestment in the future, which is rep- resented in the NASA budget, brings. Throughout the civilian space pro- gram since 1957, we have seen revolu- tions in telecommunications, revolu- tions in materials development, revolu- tions in medical techniques, revolu- tions in the development of new types of medications that do a better job in treating what ails human beings with fewer side effects. Mr. Chairman, those types of spinoffs will end if NASA collapses. And make no bones about it, the space station is the linchpin of NASA's efforts. We take away the space station, we take away a lot of the scientific research that will end up providing a huge improvement in the standard of living for every human being on this earth, and not just in the United States, but else- where as well. So let us not eat our seed corn. Let us not turn our back on research. Let us continue to support the space sta- tion by voting down the Obey amend- ment. Mr. Chairman, this amendment calls into question the American commit- ment to space. We should not be ques- tioning that. If it is adopted, it willCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7852 July 27, 1995 mean that the Congress will have, in effect, thrown away the $17 billion al- ready spent on the development of the space station, and the 50,000 pounds of material that have been already pro- duced that will go up into orbit. It will welch on our international partners: the Russians, the European space agency, the Germans, the French, the Canadians, the Japanese, and will tell those international part- ners that America is an unreliable partner in any big-ticket expensive sci- entific investment and tell them that the $6 billion that they have spent will be thrown away, just as the $17 billion that we have spent. Mr. Chairman, I do not think that that is the example that we should be setting in the Congress of the United States. The $400 million that is trans- ferred into HUD does not buy very much housing, but it is done at the ex- pense of wrecking a major program that this Congress has committed itself to for over 10 years. The space station should be kept in the budget. This amendment should be defeated. We should not wreck Ameri- ca's future in the development of the things that are spun off from what NASA has done. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 21\u00a42 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from Vermont [Mr. S ANDERS ]. (Mr. SANDERS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Obey amend- ment. Mr. Chairman, is it really appro- priate to be talking about another $74 billion investment for a space station when we have 5 million children in America who are hungry and this Con- gress is cutting back on nutrition pro- grams and food stamps? I do not think that that is a proper or moral tradeoff. We should not be doing that. Mr. Chairman, the budget that we are dealing with now devastates pro- grams for affordable housing. How can low-income people bring up a family when they make $6 an hour and are forced to pay 50 or 60 percent of their limited incomes for housing? How many more families, how many more children, will be made homeless as a result of this budget? That is not right. Mr. Chairman, the wealthy in our country have the resources to send their kids to the finest private schools and the finest colleges, colleges which often cost $25,000 a year or more. The working class and the middle class of this country do not have that luxury. In fact, it is harder and harder for the average American family to af- ford college for their kids. Mr. Chairman, how do we tell the working families of this country that we are prepared to spend tens of bil- lions more on the space station, but we are cutting back drastically on student loans, on Pell grants, on upward bound, on the National Service Program; con-gressional decisions which will make it impossible for millions of American kids to afford college. Billions more for hardware in space; major cuts in edu- cation. That does not make sense. The Republican budget that we are operating under eliminates LIHEAP. Elderly people in Vermont, throughout this country, will go cold when the weather becomes 20 below zero. Mr. Chairman, $74 billion more for the space station; elderly people in Amer- ica going cold. Those are wrong prior- ities. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 5 minutes to the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. W ALK- ER], the chairman of the Committee on Science. Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Obey amendment that would kill 40,000 high-technology American jobs and the support of that amendment by the gentleman from California [Mr. B ROWN ] that would somehow make NASA better by taking $2 billion out of its budget this year. Mr. Chairman, today's decision is about the future. Today's decision is about doing something that will be re- membered as a step into human kind's destiny. Today's decision is about con- tributing to the never-ending quest of human exploration. Today's decision is looking beyond our present problems and building something toward tomor- row. The space station, like all the other vehicles that have carried us toward the future, is surrounded by con- troversy. It is easy to dispute, even mock, the unknown. Because what we will learn by going to the frontier is more about imagination and hope than it is about hard, cold fact, the poten- tial of the space station often defies de- scription; and that is a problem in leg- islative debate. But history, rather than science, is instructive. The easy argument against exploration always has been not here, not now, because there are too many other needs that must be met first with our limited resources. Invariably, throughout history that easy argument has been wrong. Men and women who have bought the easy argument have become the defenders of the status quo and their dreams have been lost. Na- tions who have bought the easy argu- ment have lost their sense of destiny and declined in both power and pres- tige. Mr. Chairman, between now and the year 2002, we will spend something less than two-tenths of 1 percent of our pro- jected national outlays to build, orbit, and man a space station. In that same period we will spend at least 12 percent of our total national outlays, or more than 70 times than what we spend on space station, paying interest on the national debt. Massive commitment to debt without some small investments in exploration and imagination is not the foundation on which great nations are built or sus- tained. Still, putting men and womenin space to live and work takes real money. We owe the American people no less than an assurance that the money will be well spent. We will do completely unique sci- entific work aboard the space station that holds the promise of new discov- eries. The payoff could be enormous. We will develop new technologies in order to build the space station that will allow us to build world class prod- ucts here on Earth. The payoffs will be immediate and real. We will forge a partnership with the international community which will build mutual trust and respect. The payoff is a promise of peace. We will cooperate in an international venture that may prove to be a model for other scientific endeavors. The pay- off will be a triumph of American lead- ership. Are the payoffs worth the price? For some here, the answer is obviously ``no.'' They want to spend the money in other ways. But they would have us give up a lot. When we abandon space station, we stop 30 years of progress in human space flight. When we abandon space station, we leave the space shuttle as a magnificent flying machine without its original mission. When we abandon space station, we kill off the last major science project being done with international partners and jeopardize the future of coopera- tive efforts. When we abandon space station, we abandon American leadership in the arena of the future and leave the po- tential of space to others. When we abandon space station, the dream is no longer alive. Mr. Chairman, if my colleagues came to Congress to, in some small way, touch the future, here is their chance. Somewhere out there, on the endless frontier, is the destiny of humankind. We can step toward that destiny, or can we step back, away from it. I hope most of us will choose to step forward. Mr. Chairman, my colleagues' sup- port for the space station will allow Americans to know a new and unique frontier for the first time. And in knowing that frontier, America will de- fine the future. I yield back the bal- ance of my time. /ballot1445 Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 3 minutes to the gen- tleman from Texas [Mr. D ELAY]. Mr. D ELAY. Mr. Chairman, I am, in- deed, honored to follow the distin- guished chairman of the Committee on Science and his remarks. He is right on. He is right on the issue, and I ap- preciate the work that the chairman of the subcommittee on VA, HUD, and independent agencies has done on this issue. He has been very fair in allocat- ing these funds. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposi- tion to this very misguided amend- ment. For the most part, the accounts the gentleman from Wisconsin seeks toCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7853 July 27, 1995 increase have already been accommo- dated in the managers amendment. In regard to the VA medical account, this is the only account in the bill that has already received an increase over the fiscal year 1995 level. The Obey amendment attempts to re- direct the priorities set out in this bill and I submit to my colleagues that the priorities of the gentleman from Wis- consin are far different from those of the majority of this House. While this amendment makes rather small add backs to several accounts, it terminates the international space sta- tion program. This is a program that represents one of the few areas of this bill where Federal tax dollars actually contribute to an investment in this Na- tion's future. I am a vigorous supporter of the space station for many reasons. For me, and I think for most Americans, America's space program is one of the activities undertaken by our Govern- ment which is unquestionably legiti- mate. And the objectives are far too impor- tant to compromise. Forget the unparalled knowledge about space it- self, forget even the new heights of international cooperation and the building of inhabitable structures in space. The long-duration microgravity ca- pabilities of the space station will di- rectly affect research in cell and devel- opmental biology, human physiology, biotechnology, fluid physics, combus- tion science, materials science, bench- mark physics and the large-scale com- mercial development of space. We can- not afford to forgo the tremendous im- pact these scientific efforts will produce. Moreover, the reaching of these ob- jectives through space research is ex- actly the type of activity that Ameri- cans expect their Government to un- dertake. This expectation is what sepa- rates space station funding from Fed- eral spending on paintings and poetry, on museums, publishing, broadcasting, farm subsidies, loan guarantees, real estate development, and bank bailouts. And let me be clear: To those who be- lieve that we can maintain a human space program without the space sta- tion, don't fool yourselves, without the space station there is no shuttle pro- gram and without that, there is no NASA. I submit to my colleagues that the space station is a program we can- not afford not to fund. I urge my colleagues to reject this misguided amendment. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from New Jersey [Mr. Z IMMER ]. Mr. ZIMMER. Mr. Chairman, later in the debate on this legislation, the gen- tleman from Indiana [Mr. R OEMER ] and I will be proposing an amendment that will apply the entire savings from the elimination of the space station pro- gram to deficit reduction. But I rise in support of the amend- ment offered by the gentleman fromWisconsin [Mr. O BEY] because I do be- lieve that it is a worthwhile amend- ment to support as well. Although I would prefer that all the money go to deficit reduction, I believe that the $400 million of deficit reduction which is in- cluded in the Obey amendment is cer- tainly not chopped liver and in future years the elimination of the space sta- tion will free up tens of billions of dol- lars for deficit reduction and for more cost-effective programs in space and on Earth. Let me say right off the bat, I think ``Apollo 13'' is a wonderful movie, and I do believe that it is the destiny of hu- mankind to explore space, to boldly go where no one has gone before, but I do believe, with this expenditure, as with every other expenditure that we con- sider, we have got to look at the num- bers and we have got to be hard-eyed in our justification for it. I marvel at how some of the flintiest, hard-core fiscal conservatives in this House get all wobbly and emotional when the subject comes to the space station. I just urge you to look at the space station with the same hard-eyed ana- lytical approach that you do with other spending programs. I believe that a critical reason why we have to kill the space station is the reason that my friend from California, the former chairman of the Committee on Science has laid out. There is no one, I believe, who feels more strongly about science and believes more deeply in space ex- ploration than the gentleman from California [Mr. B ROWN ], the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Science. He has come to the realization that we cannot afford both to continue good science in space and to build the space station. I concur. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. S TOCKMAN ]. Mr. STOCKMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time to speak today on space sta- tion. My friend from New Jersey said we get wobbly and tear up when we talk about the space station. That is be- cause I think of the starving children around the world who are hungry. We say, how can we feed these kids? Well, we are going to feed them one time by transferring the money. Ladies and gentlemen, the answers to the problems may be by going to space. When we go to space, we have a totally new environment in which we can solve many problems. We are denying our scientists that access to that research if we vote to cut the space station. It is wrong. It is misguided, and it is shortsighted. I am embarrassed to say we cannot even cut the National Endowment for the Arts 10 percent, but we are willing to cut our Nation's future. Queen Isabella had problems. She had potholes. She had problems. She still sought out new worlds.We will always have problems, but we will always not have the space station. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gen- tleman from Illinois [Mr. E VANS ]. Mr. EVANS. Mr. Chairman, I find it ironic that on this day of the dedica- tion of the Korean war veterans memo- rial on The Mall, we will shortly be working here with the new Republican majority on the Hill to vote to deeply cut veterans' benefits. This bill fails to meet the promise we made to our Nation's veterans in the areas of medical benefits, education, vocational rehabilitation and many other areas. If you do not believe what we Democrats are saying about this bill, I believe you should at least listen to the major veterans' organizations that strongly oppose it. The American Legion believes that the dramatic VA funding reductions called for will clear- ly undermine the commitment of our Nation to its veterans. This Nation's contract with its veterans is irrev- ocable and must never be abrogated. The Veterans of Foreign Wars says, ``The designated appropriations still fall well short of the funding necessary to maintain even the current level of earned entitlements for our veterans,'' and it says, ``The cuts cross the line and fall well short.'' The Paralyzed Veterans of America is upset gains in VA medical care account were achieved only at the expense of other major vet- erans' programs. Vietnam Veterans of America say the cuts ``far exceed what is fair and equitable and that it will force the VA to decide between equally worthy groups of patients.'' The Dis- abled Veterans are incensed because this bill cuts benefits to some service- connected veterans saying, ``The pro- posal is ill-advised and strikes at the very heart of our Nation's obligation to provide compensation to all citizen sol- diers disabled in the defense of the freedoms we all enjoy.'' That is a provision that would deny mentally incompetent veterans any benefits if their estates are valued at less than $25,000. The Obey amendment is important for the veterans of our country. It rein- states the cuts made in those mentally incompetent veterans' benefits, for ex- ample. I urge my colleagues to stand up and support the Obey amendment, and that will be their effort to stand up for our veterans as well. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gen- tleman from Texas [Mr. H ALL]. Mr. HALL of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the gentleman from Wiscon- sin [Mr. O BEY] that we have to make every effort to ensure that our tax- payers are getting the most for their tax dollars. I certainly agree with the gentleman from Wisconsin that we need to eliminate wasteful and unnec- essary programs. I even go so far as to agree we need to cut back wherever we can, and I am willing to have a side-by-side review ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7854 July 27, 1995 my record of having cutbacks and try- ing to be frugal with the people's money. But Americans are not going to be getting the most for their tax dollars if they abandon the project that is going to help us have a better future. My basic support is for the biomedical thrust in space. We are still searching for cures for cancer, diabetes and other diseases. Micro-gravity research in space already has had encouraging re- sults and has raised our hopes for fu- ture medical breakthroughs. Of course, there are no guarantees. Jonas Salk had no guarantee. Louis Pasteur had no guarantee. Dr. Fleming had no guarantee. There are no guaran- tees. But we have not found these cures here in this environment, and we might just find them in the weightless envi- ronment of space. Those Americans whose lives are threatened by disease would argue that finding a cure for their illness would be well worth this financial investment in the space station. Little children who have lost their hair to chemotherapy, tubes in them, veterans of the wars of the world wasting away, these are peo- ple who have hope in research. Who would not be willing to pay 2.2 cents a day in return for this invest- ment? Even if we do not eventually find these cures, the technological and scientific benefits that will result will justify this expenditure. Mr. Chairman, I urge you to vote against the Obey amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. C RAMER ]. Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the termination of the international space station. Mr. Chairman, there have been seven votes in the House to terminate space sta- tion since 1991. The space station has survived every vote. We have had a firefight every year. I urge the Members to oppose this amendment. You cannot be responsible and build a house and get to the point of putting the roof on it and say now is the time to turn our back on this pro- gram. We have gone too far to do that. If we give up on space station, we give up on human space exploration. Do not let the 104th Congress be the Congress depicted in another movie much like ``Apollo 13,'' as the Congress that turned its back on this very criti- cal program. Support the space station. Vote against this amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentle- woman from California [Ms. H ARMAN ]. (Ms. HARMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend her re- marks.) Ms. HARMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in bipartisan support of a strong, bal- anced space program, and therefore must join the bipartisan opposition to the Obey amendment to terminate the international space station.Our space program must balance human space flight with key science, aeronautics and technology initiatives like the Mission to Planet Earth. By killing the space station, we will great- ly disrupt this balance by effectively ending NASA's human space flight ef- forts. When I came to Congress 21\u00a42years ago, I was a space station skeptic. I was concerned about the program's cost and how it was being managed. I was not sure that the program's bene- fits justified continued investment by American taxpayers. But NASA's Administrator Dan Goldin has brought the station pro- gram under control. NASA has stream- lined management by selecting a single prime contractor, and cut program costs by adding incentives for cost per- formance and penalties for delays. Mr. Chairman, I am now persuaded that the program's benefits are enor- mous. Station's unique zero-gravity re- search environment will allow new in- sights into human health and disease prevention and treatment. Station's international nature, especially its Russian involvement, will demonstrate that former adversaries can move be- yond the cold war and into new era of peaceful cooperation. Station is an investment in our fu- ture. Twenty-six years ago, Neil Arm- strong took his first step on the Moon\u00d0thereby inspiring a whole gen- eration of Americans. Now, the space station will finally give us a permanent presence in space, and will give the next generation a springboard to future human exploration of our universe. Mr. Chairman, our country needs a strong and balanced space program. The international space station must continue. /ballot1500 Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gen- tleman from Florida [Mr. W ELDON ]. Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I stand in opposition to this amendment and rise to speak out in support of our international space sta- tion. NASA has cut its budget 35 percent since fiscal year 1993, saving the tax- payers $40 billion. NASA's fiscal 1996 budget is below their fiscal year 1992 budget in real dollars. Aerospace is the single strongest ex- port sector in the U.S. economy; 1993 exports topped $40 billion. Station is less than 15 percent of the NASA budg- et, one-seventh of 1 percent of the Fed- eral budget, and costs each American taxpayer $9 a year. In essence, Mr. Chairman, we have a great program here. It is on budget, it is on time, and we have an agency that has been leading the charge in doing it smarter, faster, quicker, with less money, and what we are trying to do here is congratulate and encourage that Agency by kicking them when they are doing a good job. This space station, I am convinced, is vital and important for our Nation toremain the world's leader in science, technology, as well as education, and I speak out very, very strongly in oppo- sition to this amendment. I believe our space station is part of our future, it is important for our children, and I en- courage all our colleagues to vote against this amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Houston, TX, Mr. G ENEGREEN . (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the fu- ture of our manned space program. This space station is not, as some peo- ple call it, a pork-barrel program. It is the excitement of our era, the inter- national space station. Mr. Chairman, I serve on the Com- mittee on Economic and Educational Opportunities, and every school I go into and I talk about space and space exploration, the children light up whether they are in the poorest neigh- borhoods or the richest neighborhoods. That is the future of our country. The opponents of the space station have ar- gued that this program costs too much. The truth is that every dollar spent on space programs returns at least $2 in direct and indirect benefits. Our com- mitment to America's future today will accelerate breakthroughs in tech- nology and engineering that will have immediate, practical applications for life on Earth. It will inspire our chil- dren, foster the next generation of sci- entists, engineers, and satisfy human- ity's ancient need to explore and achieve. A robust space station program assures our students that they are crit- ical to the Nation\u00d0that they are the next generation\u00d0and that the thrill of just beginning starts with them wheth- er they are in kindergarten or in the 12th grade. By voting in favor of this space station, again the Obey amend- ment, my colleagues can confirm their equipment to the science of learning. I ask my colleagues that they base their decision on the art of science and not the art of politics of the moment. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Massa- chusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ]. (Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts asked and was given permission to re- vise and extend his remarks.) Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, in just a few minutes we are going to see a lot of Members leave this floor and go down the street to the war memorial for the Korean war veterans, and, while that is a commendable pro- gram that is far overdue for our Na- tion's veterans, I think it would do us some good to concentrate a little bit on what is going on in our Committee on Veterans' Affairs. The veterans of this country for the large measure are getting older. When they get older, they need more health care, and yet we no longer approach veterans' issues as to whether or not they served thisCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7855 July 27, 1995 country when the country put the call out, but we say whether or not their budget is going to fit into the needs of our country right at the moment for the people paying the taxes. Well, I think it is important that we have a balance in terms of taxes in this country, but I do not think we ought to be taking it out of the hide of those veterans that served this country and defended this Nation when the call went out, and that is exactly what this bill does. We say all the Nation's veter- ans are held harmless because they get the same amount of money this year as they did last year. First of all, that is not true; and sec- ond, they need more money. Anybody that would choose to go into a veter- an's hospital versus a private hospital in this country today has not visited a veterans' hospital. Mr. Chairman, we need to recognize that it is only the republicans that could come up with this bizarre con- cept that we need to take money out of the space program in order to cut our Nation's veterans' programs so that we can turn around and cut our housing programs by $6 billion. As my colleagues know, at some point there has got to be some ration- ale of what it is we are trying to ac- complish around here. Certainly I would very much like to see out coun- try invest in the Advanced Technology Program. The Republicans killed that last night on the House floor. To sug- gest that what we want to do is have a space program to increase technologies is a bizarre twist on what the purpose of the space program was to begin with. For those of my colleagues who may have forgotten we built the space pro- gram not to create new technologies, we built the space program because we were threatened by the Russians that could control space and perhaps gain control over this country's security. If we are interested in fighting back on the technology front, let us invest in technology. Let us not rob the home- less the way this bill does. I support the Obey amendment. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. W ARD]. Mr. WARD. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the Obey amend- ment. Mr. Chairman, I serve on the Com- mittee on Science. I serve on the Sub- committee on Space and Aeronautics. I have heard the arguments. I have vis- ited a NASA center in Huntsville, AL, and was treated very nicely and gener- ously and kindly. But even after that, even after that, I feel that we cannot afford to fund the space station. I do not feel there will be the payoffs; I do not feel that it is the correct decision at this time to make. I fully support the shuttle program, and I am afraid when I hear the argu- ment that the shuttle program will have to be cut down or eliminated if there is no space station. I think thereis plenty of value in the shuttle pro- gram and in the entire space program without the space station. It does not require a space station to be a produc- tive contributor. Mr. Chairman, I support the obey amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr Chair- man, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gen- tleman from Texas [Mr. C HAPMAN ]. Mr. CHAIRMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS for yielding this time to me, and I want to speak for my allot- ted time on an issue I think that is im- portant. In my decade now, in the House of Representatives, I think the total votes on station in this House of Rep- resentatives now number 19. We have voted over and over and over again about this issue, and during the process of the years of those votes we now have invested over $12 billion in this project, done so in a way with international co- operative agreements from 13 nations who themselves have invested over $4 billion so far in this project. We are halfway home. We have this project under construction. Station is bending metal. We will be launching its first components in just a couple of years. The program of space station is the program that NASA has given us for decades, and that is a program of a future, of less pain and suffering, of greater science, of advancements of technology, of a stronger economy, and leadership in a global environment. We ought not back off our agreements, our investment, our future. Mr. Chairman, what we can do today is once more say, and hopefully finally, that we are going to keep our agree- ments, we are going to build space sta- tion, and we are going to know the process of doing so, that like all other investments historically in NASA, this one is going to return to the people of our country vastly more than we will spend in this appropriations bill. Defeat the Obey amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from Florida [Mr. S TEARNS ]. (Mr. STEARNS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. STEARNS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this shortsighted amendment. All of us have seen in re- cent months what has happened in the space program, the recent docking be- tween America's space shuttle and the Russian space station. It brings new hope for greater cooperation in our ef- forts to understand our planet, our solar system, and even our galaxy, but, as nations from around the world are working together to establish a space station where we can work together to- ward a better future for our children, this amendment would end, end our manned space station program. All of us remember what President Ronald Reagan said about the space program: ``The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted, it belongs to the brave.''He was also talking about our space program when he said: ``We'll continue our quest in space. There will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civil- ians, more teachers in space. Nothing ends here. Our hopes and our journeys continue.'' And I remember President Kennedy talking about the space program when he said, ``. .. not because it is easy, be- cause it is hard.'' Mr. Chairman, if this amendment passes, mankind's dreams of reaching out from our world will end. A hope for greater understanding of our world and even for new developments in areas such as medicine and metallurgy, will end also all because we were unwilling to look ahead, invest in the future. Let me quote a poem as I close from Alfred Tennyson: For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see. Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be. Saw the heav- ens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails. Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales. My colleagues, today we have the op- portunity to make this dream a re- ality. Vote no on the Obey amendment. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield my- self the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. O BEY] is recog- nized for 41\u00a42minutes. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, one of the previous speakers in opposition to this amendment said that my priorities were wrong. Well, I think I have the same priorities as the people who I run into when I visit with them in Wausau, or Stevens Point, or Chippewa Falls, or Wisconsin Rapids, or Superior, or any other place in my district. My prior- ities are the 80,000 displaced American workers who will be cut out of worker training programs in the next appro- priation bill to come before this House. My priorities are the 50,000 kids who are going to get tossed out of Head Start programs they would otherwise be able to be taken into in the next ap- propriation bill that is going to come before this House. My priority would be the young people who are going to lose their college loans in the next appro- priation bill to come before this House. My priority would be the 600,000 Ameri- cans who will lose any help whatsoever from their Government to help heat their houses in winter and cool them in the summer so you don't have 800 more deaths like we had 2 weeks ago. The Clinton administration just released emergency fuel assistance money. There will be no emergency fuel assist- ance money next year if the Repub- lican majority has their way on the ap- propriation bill coming before this House next. My priorities would be the disabled veterans who are being chis- eled on their disability benefits, 12,000 of whom will wind up being squeezed so that we can make more room in this budget for other priorities. I make no apology for putting those folks first. My priorities would also be science right here on Earth, at NIH, NSF, justCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7856 July 27, 1995 name it: Cancer research, Alzheimer's, heart disease; we have plenty of science that we need to support right here on Earth. /ballot1515 I would also just close by reading one paragraph from the letter I received from the Disabled American Veterans. It simply says this: America's service- connected disabled veterans and their families are deeply disturbed by recent actions taken by the House Committee on Appropriations which would termi- nate compensation payments to cer- tain service-connected veterans in order tional funding for Department of Vet- erans Affairs [VA] health care. DAV certainly understands the need to put our Nation's financial house in order; however, this proposal is ill-advised and strikes at the very heart of our Na- tion's sacred obligation to provide compensation to all citizen-soldiers disabled in defense of the freedoms all of us enjoy.'' I agree with that statement. So I would simply urge you to support the Obey amendment. It saves almost half a million dollars on the deficit. It helps meet our commitment to veterans, a commitment which this bill welches on. This amendment corrects that. It also helps us to provide some decent housing for additional Americans who are elderly and disabled. Mr. Chairman, I make absolutely no apology for those priorities at all. Those ought to be the priorities of this entire Congress. I urge Members sup- port the Obey amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, as we close this debate on the Obey amendment, I think it is very im- portant for all of those who are inter- ested and are listening to know that the amount of money that is available for NASA is a very small fraction of the total dollars available in this bill. We do not begin to put into station, let alone NASA, nearly the money we put into veterans programs or housing. NASA's programs should probably be in another bill so you would not have these kinds of comparisons that really make no sense at all. America's greatness has been largely achieved by way of America's dreams. It was our willingness to think about a new world, a new future for mankind, that led to America in the first place. It was Americans seeking out their dreams that allowed us to build the West, the pioneer spirit that made the difference not only then, but makes the difference today, not just in our minds, but in our hearts as well. One great dream for the future lies in space. There is absolutely no question there is broadly based support from the public for man's exploration in space. What remains is a partnership with friends around the world. We are, to- gether, attempting to make break- through in space that will impact tech- nology and that will create a new op- portunity, not only for ourselves, but for mankind.Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, which would destroy space station, and I believe destroy all of NASA's programs. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. O BEY]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote, and pending that, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY] will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. Are there other amendments to title I? If not, the Clerk will designate title II.

The CHAIRMAN. Are there amend- ments to title II? AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . STOKES Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment, numbered 63. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. S TOKES : Page 22, after ``Secretary:'' on line 14, insert ``Pro- vided further, That if authorizing legislation is not enacted into law by December 31, 1995, the amount provided for voucher assistance may be reallocated by the Secretary to pub- lic housing modernization, drug elimination grants, and section 8 incremental rental as- sistance:'' Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, the bill provides $862 million for new and unau- thorized vouchering out activities under the section 8 program. The funds provided are contingent upon authoriz- ing language being enacted. I have a perfecting amendment that is quite simple. It would insert lan- guage stating that: If authorizing legislation is not enacted into law by December 31, 1995, the amount provided for voucher assistance may be re- allocated by the Secretary to public housing, modernization, drug elimination grants, and section 8 incremental rental assistance. You have to remember that this is a new program totaling $862 million being created through an appropria- tions bill. At the rate we are going with our legislative calendar this year, I think my colleagues would agree that giving further direction as to how this money should be spent in the event that no authorizing legislation is en- acted is certainly reasonable. The sum $862 million is a lot of money to be unobligated by an agency that is being reduced by $5 billion. There are millions of persons, pri- marily our elderly, the children, and the poor, who could benefit from HUD utilizing this money. Modernization funds are reduced by over $1 billion in this bill, and new incremental rental assistance is eliminated. Certainly re- storing funds to these critical areas is warranted. Furthermore, our communities and law enforcement officials desperatelyCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7860 July 27, 1995 need all the assistance they can get to help eradicating the drug problem in our communities. Mr. Chairman, this is a good and sen- sible amendment. I think Members on both sides of the aisle would like the committee to address these issues on behalf of millions of Americans. I would ask that this amendment be con- sidered at this time as perfecting the $862 million provision for vouchering out. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. The question was taken; and on a di- vision, demanded by Mr. S TOKES , there were\u00d0ayes 5, noes 5. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I de- mand a recorded vote, and pending that, I make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House today, further pro- ceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. The CHAIRMAN. Are there other amendments to title II? AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . KENNEDY OF MASSACHUSETTS Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment, No. 47. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. K ENNEDY of Massachusetts: Page 20, line 25, strike ``$10,041,599,000'' and insert ``$10,361,589,000''. Page ?4, line 16, strike ``$320,000,000'' and insert ``$0''. Page 39, after line 17, insert the following new subsection: (c) E XEMPTION OF ELDERLY AND DISABLED FAMILIES FROM RENT INCREASES .\u00d0Sub- sections (a) and (b) of this section shall not apply with respect to any elderly family or disabled family (as such terms are defined in section 3(b) of such Act) who, on October 1, 1995, is receiving rental assistance under sec- tion 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 or is occupying a dwelling unit assisted under such action. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, this amendment protects our Nation's senior citizens from rent increases that are ordered under the bill. This bill would raise the rents on 2.7 million assisted housing tenants. The Kennedy-Frank-Stokes amend- ment simply asks that our senior citi- zens who live in assisted housing today are protected against these rent in- creases. About 1 million elderly households will have to pay between $150 and $400 more a year in rent, and they simply cannot afford it. These new rent in- creases will affect only the poorest sen- iors and seniors that have no place else to go. The only seniors that are af- fected by this rent increase are by defi- nition seniors on fixed income. The fact is that they have no corresponding increase in their fixed income to keepup with the rent increases that have been ordered by the bill as it has been filed. Therefore, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], the gentleman from Mas- sachusetts [Mr. F RANK ], and I have drafted this amendment to provide some small relief to this group of vul- nerable Americans, whose rent in- creases will mean them having to choose between food and medicine or heat and shelter. The cost is small, it is only $77 mil- lion. It will provide a little bit more se- curity to our seniors, and I hope that the Members on both sides of the aisle would vote for its passage. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, this amendment real- ly goes to the heart of the kind of pol- icy differences that the Nation is being presented with at this time. This amendment deals with the rents that are charged to some of the poorest peo- ple in this country. We have programs, subsidized housing programs, for older people. We are being asked in this bill to raise the percentage of their income from 30 percent to 32 percent of their income. Understand that that is not a 2 percent rent increase, that is a 62\u00a43 percent increase. Two percent of 30 per- cent is 62\u00a43percent. Under current law, if Social Security pays people a 3-percent cost of living increase in December, elderly people's rents would go up by 3 percent. Some of them are angry at this. They say you are giving with one hand and tak- ing with another. Many of us have talked to older people, who felt that this policy of their rent going up by the same percentage of the cost of liv- ing was a serious problem. Well, the Republican Party is going to change that. No longer, under this bill, if you are an elderly person living in subsidized housing, will your rent go up by the same amount as your Social Security. If this bill passes, your rent will go up by three times as much in percentage as Social Security, because if we get a 3 percent cost of living in- crease, under this bill the rent will then go up in that 1 year 92\u00a43percent. Now, this is a habit that the Repub- licans have. The last time they were able to control the budget of this House, in 1981, in the Gramm-Latta bill, the rents that people in subsidized housing, and we are talking about el- derly people, older people, including some who only live on Social Security or Social Security and a small pension, and they are living in subsidized hous- ing, and they were in 1981 paying 25 percent of their rent. Under an amend- ment named for a Republican Senator, Ed Brooke, it was the Brooke amend- ment, the Republican Party, when they had control in 1981, changed that and went from 25 percent to 30 percent. Now they want to do it again. So it is very clear. We now have a pattern. Every time the Republican Party is in a position to control thebudget of this House, poor, elderly peo- ple see their rent go up by a significant amount more than their income goes up. It will make them two for two. Of course, the House budget resolution called for an increase to 35 percent. So one assumes that is not their last ef- fort to increase it. As I have said before, older people who are familiar with the literary his- tory of this country will recognize this, because they are familiar with Dick Tracy. There was a character in Dick Tracy known as Evil-Eye Fleegle who specialized in whammies. His worse ef- fect on you was the triple whammy. Now, under the Republican budget, the cost of living increase to be paid for Social Security recipients is going to go down. The Republican Party's budget says old people get too much money when inflation occurs, and their budget resolution, enacted by them, adopted by them, calls for a reduction in the cost of living increase later in this century. /ballot1530 So the cost-of-living increase for an order older person living on $10,000 a year will go down. That is whammy one. Whammy two will be what they do to you on Medicare, when your copayments go up and your part B pay- ments go up. If you are so poor and you are in such circumstances that you live in public housing, you get the triple whammy, because your rent will go up. And what the gentleman from Massachusetts is saying is that should not happen, that the 30-percent income should stay the same. It does not mean the rent, their rents will never go up. The current law says their rents will go up with their income. The Republican bill says rents will go up more than income. Originally it was going to do that to people in public housing, too. The man- agers' amendment fixed that so people who live in public housing will now stay at 30 percent, and I am glad. But their friends, relatives, their peers who live in a section 8 unit, who live in an assisted housing unit, subsidized hous- ing go, who live in 202, their rents will go up by three times as much as Social Security. Their rent will go up from 30 percent to 32 percent of their income. We are not talking about people with substantial amounts of discretionary income. We are talking about the el- derly poor. Raising the rents, raising the percentage of the meager incomes that the elderly poor have to pay to fi- nance a tax cut, to finance a B\u00b12 bomb- er, to finance a manned space station, to finance all these other things, is, in my judgment, quite wrong. I do not think anything more starkly illus- trates the different approaches of the two parties. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I rise very briefly to oppose this amendment. Within this account, weCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7861 July 27, 1995 were very, very sensitive about the question of considering raising rents? Should you? When should you? Indeed, this program has been in effect for a number of years now. There has been one adjustment to that, almost a decade ago. This raises the percentage for rental expenses from 30 to 32 percent. The recommendation of the House-passed Committee on the Budget was 35 percent. The committee chose to back off because of some of the questions that were raised by other Members who are opposing the amend- ment. The real effect is somewhere in the neighborhood of perhaps $12 a month. This account is growing so rapidly that if it continues on its present pattern, it will push out any number of other very important housing programs that af- fect the very same people that we are talking about. It is very important to recognize that there is no free lunch in this process. Everybody has to partici- pate. The offset that the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] provides in his amendment would essentially zero emergency assistance accounts. We do not have as much money in FEMA in this bill as he suggests he uses as an offset. That alone would have easily allowed me to ask you to call this amendment out of order, but frankly I thought we ought to have the discussion. In fact, the Kennedy amendment would eliminate a com- promise between what the Committee on the Budget recommended and what is necessary to see that this program remains whole and viable. He cannot effectively offset it against emergency accounts. Indeed, if he did, he would dramatically affect many of the same people that he is trying to help by way of his amendment. I urge a ``no'' vote on this unwork- able amendment. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, first, I would have to respond to my distinguished chair- man's comment with reference to the offset that the gentleman from Massa- chusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] uses. In the chairman's earlier amendment this afternoon, he used the same source of funds. He used about $85 million out of the same funding. So I think what the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. KENNEDY ] is doing here is proper in the sense that he is utilizing the same funding. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STOKES. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, we did use an offset of $50 million to help housing accounts. That leaves $20 million approximately. We are talk- ing about some $300 million under the recommendation of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ]. We were attempting to help some of these same people by that former offset butalso trying to deal with the real world in terms of what is actually available in the account. Mr. STOKES. Let me just say, Mr. Chairman, over 700,000 households could experience rent increases that would average over $1,000 annually. You must remember that millions of elderly who are often single disabled women depend on section 8 in order to find decent and affordable housing. Rent increases would cause great hardship for our elderly who are often the least able to bear such expenses. These increases also come at a time when our Republican colleagues want to force the elderly to pay more for their health care through massive cuts to Medicare. Our seniors are being assailed on all fronts. Elderly Americans could be forced to move into lower cost housing, much of which is likely to be sub- standard. For those who may fall be- hind in their rent payments, they may find themselves evicted. Many could also become homeless. Moreover, Mr. Chairman, these in- creases come at a time when a new study finds that there is a disturbing and growing affordable housing short- age in the United States. This shortage has resulted in most poor renters hav- ing to pay rents that consume a very high percentage of their incomes, over 30 percent. In fact, three out of very five poor renters, 4.1 million people, paid at least half their incomes for housing in 1993. How do we expect our seniors, who are on limited and fixed incomes, to not only pay more rent but also find decent, affordable housing when the supply is diminishing? Mr. Chairman, I would urge our col- leagues to support the Kennedy-Frank- Stokes amendment. Ms. D ELAURO. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup- port today for the Kennedy-Frank- Stokes amendment which restores vital funding for HUD low-income housing assistance programs for the el- derly and disabled. The amendment will protect seniors from an unfair and unaffordable rent increase. The rent hikes included in this ex- treme bill could cost seniors in my dis- trict hundreds of more dollars per year. I don't know about everybody's dis- tricts, but I know that's a lot of money for seniors in my district. In my district, the residents of Bella Vista Apartments in New Haven, CT, know all too well about rent increases. Last year, Bella Vista tenants were asked to pay an additional $35 per month in rent, and now, just last week, they were slapped with another rent in- crease of $45 per month. Mr. Chairman, they simply cannot afford another rent increase. The tenants of Bella Vista are like seniors all over this country. They live on fixed incomes and struggle to make ends meet. They are often faced withdifficult financial choices\u00d0they must choose between paying for vital medi- cal services, like prescription drugs, or paying for the heating bill in the win- ter. They do their best, but sometimes they need our help. Rent assistance is one way to help. This country has a proud tradition of assisting our seniors in their retire- ment. This Government has made a deal with our seniors. We say to them: If you work hard all your life and con- tribute, then we will help you when you can work no longer. Seniors have kept up their end of the bargain. They worked, they saved, and even fought wars to preserve our free- dom. But, now Republicans in this Con- gress want to walk away from the deal. They want to walk away from Medi- care; walk away from Social Security; walk away from rent assistance. It's a disgrace. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Kennedy-Frank-Stokes amend- ment, and restore decent, and afford- able housing to our seniors. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. D ELAURO. I yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, this will literally result in nearly a 7 percent rent increase for those living in as- sisted housing. And for someone living, earning maybe $1,000 a month, $12,000 a year income, which is so often what might be the case in terms of these low income, fixed income elderly, that lit- erally results in a $20 increase a month in terms of their rent, $20 a month over the course of the year. As you can begin to understand, we are talking about $240 a year in terms of the rent increase. Plus, if they get an increase in their Social Security or their pensions or the interest income goes up, that also will be subject not to 30 percent but to 32 percent. Yet we are saying, if you are in public housing, you end up facing about a 30-percent increase. This is just the camel's nose under the tent. This is the direction that we are going to in fact increase these amounts from these fixed incomes. These are the working poor very often, Mr. Chairman, those that do have a lit- tle income. They need assistance in terms of public housing, and what we are doing is pushing them into a level where they no longer will be able to meet their own needs with this assist- ance and this public housing. This is after not being subjected to any hearings, no review of this in any of the committees, no discussion by the public, just come out here, put it on the floor. This meets the bottom line in terms of budget. But my question is, What happens to the real people in the district that I represent, the elderly on fixed incomes that need that $5 a week to meet their basic needs? They are going to be hurt, and they are going to be hurt badly by this kind of amendment and by this process. They deserve better, and we can do bet- ter in terms of this process and inCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7862 July 27, 1995 terms of what is going on here. These individuals deserve our support. This amendment deserves our support. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, Members, I rise in strong opposition to the gentleman's amendment to eliminate funding for disaster relief programs administered by the Federal Emergency Manage- ment Agency. As the Member of this body who represents the congressional district that has been rocked by the most horrendous of disasters this coun- try has faced, I could not sit in my of- fice and watch this assault on the Agency that stood as the foundation for the relief efforts following the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Build- ing on April 19 of this year. The response of FEMA to the Okla- homa City bombing is best described in this excerpt from the committee report accompanying the underlying legisla- tion. I quote: On April 19, 1995, at 9:04 a.m., an explosive device contained within a rented truck was detonated outside the Alfred P. Murrah Fed- eral Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, thereby killing 168 individuals and injuring another 467. Within minutes of this disaster, FEMA personnel were actively engaged in structuring the Federal response which, cou- pled with the response of the State and local governmental entities, business and charity groups throughout the area and the country, and thousands of Oklahomans and others from throughout the United States, rep- resents perhaps the finest example of public and private cooperation, during a time of cri- sis as has been observed in many decades. Despite having no specific experience with this type of disaster, well trained personnel dealing with virtually every aspect of disas- ter response were quickly and efficiently in place and beginning the difficult job of re- sponding to this devastating event. Starting with FEMA's Director and on down the chain of command in FEMA and numerous other departments and agencies, every individual involved with the response to this disaster deserves the sincere appreciation and grati- tude of this Committee for a job well done. From personal experience, I can say without a doubt that the FEMA re- sponse to this disaster was virtually flawless. Their treatment of the good people of Oklahoma City must be com- mended by all in this body. I ask my colleagues: Can we be as- sured that without the funds targeted by this amendment, would FEMA have the ability to react in the manner de- scribed in the committee report or that the Nation witnessed in regards to Oklahoma City. I would think not. Please oppose this ill-advised amend- ment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LUCAS. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I would like to commend the gen- tleman for his work. Immediately after, and during the process since, we have been trying to find the funds to respond to Oklahoma City and that dis- aster. To say the least, one had to ac- tually see what occurred there to beginto appreciate the devastating effect it had upon your community. Above and beyond that, there are similar problems across the country that involve disaster relief. To have an amendment that looks good on paper but in reality is suggesting that none of the other accounts are helping peo- ple who are in dire straits is a disserv- ice to the process. So the gentleman's support is very much appreciated. I ap- preciate the work the gentleman has been doing for Oklahoma City as well. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LUCAS. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, under the original filing of this amendment, we took the funds out of FEMA which would have affected the accounts that the gentleman is suggesting. After the Lazio amendment passed, there were no funds left in FEMA for us to grab, so we shifted into the Manned Spaced Flight Program and shifted a small amount of money out of that into this program. So the gentlemen are talking a lot, but that is not the account that the money comes from. I just wanted to straighten it out. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LUCAS. I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I would just point out that under the FEMA programs that it seemed to me that there was a special appropriation that was necessary this year that was passed. So often that happens with dis- aster relief assistance, that notwith- standing the fact that there are inten- tions here to meet other needs, that the Oklahoma issue was dealt with through the special rescission bill. Of course it is being signed today. I would point out that in that in- stance, over $6 billion was taken out of housing programs last year to in fact fulfill the goals that were that particu- lar bill, not goals I shared, I might say. But I want to be understood that it cer- tainly is not and should not be consid- ered as a slight to Oklahoma and other types of disaster assistance programs. Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, the gen- tleman's point is very appreciated. That is a very valid point. But we must, as I observe the process in Okla- homa City, the effective quick way in which the FEMA people responded, it is necessary that they be funded so that they have the contingency capacity to do in the other parts of the country\u00d0 heaven forbid that something should occur that requires that kind of re- sponse\u00d0the incredible job that they did in Oklahoma City. It was amazing to watch the effi- ciency of FEMA and the State and local government. It made me proud to be an Oklahoman and an American. /ballot1545 Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup- port of the amendment offered by my colleague. The adoption of this amend- ment means that the elderly residents with section 8 assistance will not face rent increases that may mean the dif- ference between staying in their homes or searching for something less expen- sive. It may also mean the difference between buying nutritious meals for a week or paying for medication pre- scribed by their doctor. To those of us that are accustomed to having an assured three meals a day, warm clothes in time of cold, com- fortable clothes in time of heat, safe roofs over our heads, we cannot visual- ize, sometimes, that in America we still have not just individuals, children or adults, but families that do not have that kind of a comfort. We still have them among us. In this case here, Mr. Chairman, it may, as I said and repeat, mean the dif- ference between a meal, and a choice between having a meal or paying for medicines or medications that have been prescribed. The dollar amount may not sound like a lot to us. Our range is in the upper 7- to 11-percent per person field in our society, so that a rental increase in terms of medical costs and Medicare premiums does have an impact. It could be a lot of cash, and it is, in- deed, a lot of cash to senior citizens. I have visited with them, some are those that grew up in the old neighborhood in what we called in San Antonio the West Side, and with whom I shared neighborhoods and living conditions. Many of the elderly with section 8 as- sistance waited for years for assisted housing. We just do not have that vol- ume of housing. They believed that this move was their last. Now what our colleagues, the Repub- licans, are requiring of them is to pay more for shelter, unless this amend- ment pending is adopted. This amend- ment means that we will not be over- turning longstanding Federal policy of 25 years, which limited a tenant's rent to 25 percent and then 30 percent, and I fought bitterly when that increase of 5 percent went in, of income for people of limited income. Let me assure my colleagues who really do not know what it is to have a very limited in- come, limited income is a very serious and an awesome terror, day in and day out, for many of our fellow Americans. Mr. Chairman, I must ask my col- leagues if this is this year's rent or in- crease to 32 percent for section 8, what is going to happen next year? When are they looking for more dollars for tax cuts? Will it once again come out of the elderly's pockets? The manager's amendment deleted the rent increase for public housing residents, but not section 8 tenants, who are not wealthier. In fairness, Mr. Chairman, I urge the adoption of this amendment. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GONZALEZ. I yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7863 July 27, 1995 Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to commend the gentleman for his advocacy of this amendment. I would point out for those who think it is not a lot of money, this is $184 million being taken from these low-income el- derly, as best we can calculate. It is $184 million being taken from them and added to their costs. Mr. Chairman, these are low-income people, many who qualified as being below the 50 percent of the median in- come that we are taking this from. They are taking this from very low-in- come, hardworking seniors on fixed in- comes who have no ability to make an adjustment to deal with this, and it is a percentage of their income, so it is absolutely against any other increase they might get, whatever it might be. I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. Mr. GONZALEZ. I thank my col- league, who is very active and has dis- tinguished himself in his field, since his arrival to this Congress. I want to thank him for adding to this. Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I want to take this op- portunity to yield to the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], the chair- man of the subcommittee. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I very much appreciate my col- league yielding. I rise only to try to clarify a portion of the earlier discus- sion on the part of the author of this amendment. He referred to an earlier Lazio amendment, and at least implied in that discussion that he really in- tended that the offset here be from NASA accounts by one way or another. The reality is that his amendment that is on file, would take it from FEMA accounts. It is a budget-buster in that connection. Literally, those FEMA accounts cannot function when they are reduced to zero. I wanted to make sure that the membership under- stood that. I presume that the author understood it, but the membership might very well have been confused. Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. I rise in support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, one of the things that I think we need to put out here is this goes directly at the elderly. When we look at the elderly, very many of them are women. When we look at women over 65 that have a pension, there is less than 13 percent of women over 65 who have a pension. That is because women who worked in those days worked in jobs that were very low in- come, did not have those kinds of bene- fits, and really are the poorest of the poor. Mr. Chairman, we see us coming after them on Medicare, we see us coming after them on this. I almost feel like we ought to blow the whistle here. We need a piling-on offense. We need black-and-white-striped referees here, or something. I feel like we are pilingon the poor, and we are piling on those that can fight back the least. There is nothing like taking on little old ladies. This is really taking on little old la- dies, if Members are going to vote for this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I think I understood from the gentleman from Massachu- setts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] that the way this would work if we do not pass this amendment, if an elderly person is in section 8 and they get a 3-percent in- crease, just to take a thing out of the air, for their Social Security, it is pos- sible for their rent to go up 9 percent. I would ask the gentleman, is that cor- rect? Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. SCHROEDER. I yield to the gen- tleman from Massachusetts. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. First, Mr. Chairman, understand that under the Republican budget they would only get a 3-percent increase in Social Secu- rity if the cost of living increase by current standards was 3.8 percent, be- cause they want to reduce that. How- ever, yes, the gentlewoman is correct. The first year this is implemented the increase in rent that an elderly resi- dent of subsidized housing will pay will be the percentage of Social Security increase plus 62\u00a43percent of their in- come; so on a 3 percent figure, that would be a 92\u00a43-percent rent increase when they only got a 3-percent in- crease in income. Mrs. SCHROEDER. I thank the gen- tleman for making that point again, because I think that is a very, very es- sential point. As I say, we are talking about a very high percentage of these people being elderly women who were discriminated against when they were in the work force, who do not have pen- sions. Maybe they should have had pen- sions, but they worked in jobs that did not give them pensions, or they had spouses that did not have pensions that they could inherit. They do not want to go home and live with their kids. They are very, very proud people. All we have to do is look right now at grocery stores where there are con- centrations of elderly, and seeing al- ready the very, very high sales of pet food among people who do not have pets. There is something going on there. If we decide to do this so that their rent could be increased, I think this is just really piling on, so I salute the gentleman from Massachusetts for his amendment. I think all of us ought to think very seriously about, yes, we have to do something about the budget; but is it fair, at a time when this House hires for the first time a ``Miss Man- ners'' who is going to tell us how to write toasts, that we turn around and say to elderly women and elderly citi- zens that they can have their rent in- creased as much as 9 percent? I do not think that people outside the Beltway will appreciate that, that we are getting a protocol official for all of us. Maybe they are going to tell us inprotocol how we tell these elderly peo- ple that we just had them bear the brunt of the budget, that it was not B\u00b1 2 bombers or other things, it was them who caused it, so ``Have a nice day, we are going to raise your rent.'' I hope others will vote for this amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K EN- NEDY ]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] will be postponed. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . FRANK OF MASSACHUSETTS Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. F RANK of Mas- sachusetts: Page 20, line 25, insert after the figure ``$10,182,359,000,'' (increase by an addi- tional $331,160,000)''. Page 37, strike ``(a)'' in line 23 and all that follows through page 38, line 19. Page 71, line 5, strike ``$5,588,000,000'' and insert ``$5,100,000,000''. Page 72, line 1, strike ``$2,618,200,000'' and insert ``$2,533,200,000''. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the amend- ment be considered as read and printed in the R ECORD . The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Massachusetts? There was no objection. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, although this was not in the RECORD , I did share a copy with the majority. Mr. Chairman, this is the companion to the amendment offered by my col- league, the gentleman from Massachu- setts [Mr. K ENNEDY ]. What he did ad- dresses this 30- to 32-percent increase for the elderly. This one addresses it for other residents of this kind of hous- ing: families and disabled individuals. It is a similar argument. The argument is that when we have decided that people are on limited in- come, and certainly the disabled would be, some of the families would be, when we are talking about people at the lower end of the spectrum, and I want to agree, the majority, and I congratu- late the gentleman from California, be- cause I think this reflected what he would like to do in the manager's amendment, he did relieve this for the poorest of the poor, and I acknowledge that. The amendment of the gentleman from California, working with the gen- tleman from New York, the chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, did undo this for the poorest of the poor, the people who live in pub- lic housing. We now have a situation where people who live in public housingCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7864 July 27, 1995 will pay only 30 percent, which is fair, but people who are in certificated hous- ing, people who may be a notch or two above, will have to go to 32 percent. This will include families, this will in- clude the working poor. These are the families who are here, working poor people. To tell them once again that they will get an increase in their rents of 62\u00a43percent, if they are making $20,000 a year, then the 2-per- cent increase is a $400-a-year increase. I have had my colleagues on the other side say that some of us were not ap- preciative of how important a $500 tax cut would be to a middle-income fam- ily. If you are making $40,000 or $50,000 a year it is very serious. If $500 is a very serious amount of money to a family making $50,000, is $400 a year then for a family making less than half that not even more serious? That is what we are saying to people. We are saying to precisely those people on whom we were trying to focus pub- lic policy attention, people who are above the welfare roles, people we are telling, ``Get off the welfare roles and get into a work situation,'' because very few will go off of welfare into a $100,000 a year job. Many will be in the low-wage jobs. Some will be eligible for this sort of housing. What we are telling them is getting $18,000, $20,000 a year and trying to sup- port a family, we will now, if you are making $20,000 a year, raise your rent by $400 a year. Think what the dispos- able income is for a family in that cat- egory. We are not talking, now, as I said, about welfare cases on the whole. The people who are on welfare have prob- ably been protected by the manager's amendment, the manager's amendment which protected the people on public housing, where we were likely to have a higher welfare percentage. We are likelier here to be talking about the working poor, because the average in- comes of the people in the assisted housing projects will be higher on the whole than the public housing. We are talking about people who get section 8's. What we are saying is, ``You have done nothing wrong, you have worked very hard, we know times are tough, and by the way, your rent just went up $400, without any increase in income.'' If their income goes up, then the rent goes up $400 plus the increase in their income. Why? So we can make sure the tax cut extends to people who make $200,000 a year. My guess is, I have not done the arithmetic, but my guess is if we lim- ited the tax cut to the people who are making only $50,000 a year, we could af- ford this amendment. This amendment cannot reach the taxes, so I do reduce funds for NASA. /ballot1600 I would have preferred to take a piece of the B\u00b12 bomber, to take a piece of some of the other unnecessary military spending projects to deal with the tax cut.If and when we get this to conference if people then want to make these kind of adjustments, I would be supportive. But we again come to a fundamental difference, I think, in approach: Tell working people who are making $20,000 a year that as we increase military spending beyond what the President has asked, beyond what anybody needs, as we subsidize the defense of others. I have to say, because these things are relevant, you may have noticed that the French were very frustrated. They wanted to send some reinforce- ments into Bosnia but they could not do it without American helicopters. How come France does not have enough helicopters to transport its own troops? Because the American defense budget has been subsidizing it. Members who want to continue the American defense budget subsidy of the French economy, a very generous act of international cooperation\u00d0``Merci,'' I say, on behalf of the people of France\u00d0are going to make up for that by telling Americans who make $20,000 a year and live in subsidized housing and who work very hard\u00d0we are talk- ing now about hard-working people\u00d0 who make $20,000 a year with a couple of kids and that are in this kind of housing, they have got a section 8 cer- tificate, and their rent goes up by 2 percent. There is no reason to do that other than, I think, a distorted set of priorities, and I hope the amendment is adopted. Mrs. SCHROEDER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman from Massachusetts is presenting a very important amendment. Just this week, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities came out with a very serious report on ``Unraveling a Consensus.'' That is what we are doing here as we proceed through these bills, unraveling a consensus that we have had across the aisle, a bipartisan con- sensus that full-time workers should not live in poverty, that that is how we wanted people to get off welfare, that we really wanted to encourage people to work, that we did not want people on welfare, and that full-time workers should not be pushed down into pov- erty. So this body proceeded to do certain things, like put in the earned income tax credit, which this points out is greatly under attack, that helped fami- lies working at that level. It also linked Medicare to low-income fami- lies. You did not have to be on welfare to get Medicare. Now we are going to block-grant it so they are all going to be at the whim of whatever State they are in if there is any at all. We are pulling away that chance of getting some medical care. There was the issue of child care, try- ing to help people get out there for child care. Well, we are pulling away that pillar from under them. Now if we do not pass the gentleman's amend- ment, we will be raising their rent at this level.These are working families. Of course one of the other things that we piled on these families if you voted for the Re- publican budget, which I did not do, is we are now going to charge single moms 15 percent to collect their child support\u00d0child support that they are owed. So the Government will withhold 15 percent to help pay off the debt. When you add each of these pieces to- gether and you look at the level of these families that we are talking about here, it all comes crumbling down. At a time I thought we had some kind of a consensus where we really wanted to reform welfare and say work is not a 4-letter word, you are what you do in this country and if you say noth- ing you are nothing, so we want to help everybody be empowered, we want to help them go to work, we are now pull- ing all the stops out from programs that were started by President Nixon, carried on by Presidents Reagan and Bush and by the Democratic Congress as kind of a consensus as to how we get there. We were just getting real close to starting to being on that path. If you go back and look at the his- tory, it was in 1986, 1990, 1993, each of those times, we raised the earned in- come tax credit. Each of those times we talked about how we should in- crease the subsidy for people who were in housing but above the welfare level trying to work their way out so there would not be that tremendous line. This was really the hand up that, yes, you have a chance. Well, we are really cutting the lifeline. You may say, ``Well, this is just one little lifeline,'' but if you voted for the Republican budget, you cut off that other little lifeline, you are going to take a 15-per- cent chunk out of every single child support payment, that is a lot of money. You are going to cut back their EITC and you are going to cut probably their child care subsidies they were getting in title XX that helped them be able to work. I put this all on top of the fact that we all know the purchas- ing power for the minimum wage is at the lowest it has been since World War II. If a person has a minimum wage job and they are trying very hard, here is what kind of support they are getting from us. These are not the people that caused the budget deficit. Why are we unloading on them? Why are we caus- ing them to pay for the budget deficit? I think those are questions we have to ask ourselves. When people get angry on that side of the aisle and yell we are talking about this class warfare and everything, you have got to really won- der. It looks like class warfare. It be- gins to look like socialism for the rich as we punish everybody who is not rich. I just think this is one more area where we are pulling the pins out from people who are struggling desperately to get out from poverty, to get out from the stigma of being called a wel- fare recipient. They want out. There are people out there working two and three jobs. They feel like a squirrel inCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7865 July 27, 1995 the wheel. They run faster and faster and faster, they are exhausted, their tongue is hanging out and they do not get out of the bottom of the wheel, un- less they can have a little help, with some medical care for their kids, or maybe some help collecting their child support without the Federal Govern- ment pulling a chunk out of it, blam- ing them for the deficit or increasing their rents or going after any number of other things, the EITC program and other things that were out there. I think American people want to help people move in this direction. I think they are tired of abuse, but they really want to help people that try. If you try, we should help them. That is what this amendment is about. I support the gentleman's amendment. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, sometimes I wonder what has happened in this country. You look back over the last few years and you see these endless attacks on the poor of America, a suggestion that somehow the poor are responsible for the problems that we face. At one point in our country's history we had a war on poverty. Today we have somehow evolved to a point where we have a war on the poor. That is what this bill at- tempts to do. It attempts to raise the rents on the most vulnerable families in this country. I offered an amendment different than the one from the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. F RANK ] to try to isolate the senior citizens out of the generalized cuts that are affecting all poor people. I offered that not because I think senior citizens are in some elite crowd that ought to be protected ver- sus other poor people, but I just think that they have a better chance of gain- ing some support from the Repub- licans. The truth of the matter is that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. F RANK ] is a more appropriate amendment, because it does not single out senior citizens that happen to vote. One of the first lessons you learn in politics is that people over the age of 90 vote 90 per- cent of the time and people under the age of 25 vote 25 percent of the time. The fact of the matter is that what we have is a situation where people, rather than pursuing policies that will end up providing this country with an educated work force into the future, rather than providing an investment in the real technologies that people are so concerned about, the technological breakthroughs of biotechnology, vote for that, but do not pretend you are voting for a space station for those purposes. What we are doing in this bill is vot- ing for a space station at the expense and on the backs of the poorest people in this country. At the same time we are providing an enormous tax break to the wealthiest people in the country. We sit and cut education programs, we cut back on health care programsfor our seniors, we cut back on the job training programs that will allow us to have the ability to compete with the Germans and the Japanese for the high-wage and the high-paying jobs that are going to be available to some- body in the future. There are going to be millions of jobs created in this world in the next 10 years, in biotechnology, in tele- communications, in all sorts of fields that are going to require an education and an educated work force. Certainly there are going to be a few Americans that can go out and pay for it. But since when do we come from a country that only the elite are allowed to do well? That is why America was started, be- cause people were sick and tired of that kind of system, so they came to Amer- ica. They established a new kind of na- tion, where people were allowed to grow to their full human potential, not because of what they were born with but because of what they made of their own lives. That is what this bill undercuts. It sends a message to the poor and the vulnerable of America, that they are the problem and we are going to cut their benefits, we are going to cut their housing, we are going to go in and strip them of the capability of getting pro- tections from the problems that exist in industry in this country, and we are going to hang them out to dry so the rest of us can walk down the street and feel good about where America is head- ed. It is not the kind of compassionate Nation that looks out for the poor, looks out for our seniors, recognizes that a group of senior citizens provided this country with the capability of being called the richest and most pow- erful Nation on Earth, because they went through World War II, the Great Depression, World War I, the Korean conflict, and at the same time created an enormous amount of wealth. Many of them did not get rich in the process. They gave their blood and their sweat and their tears for Amer- ica. They gave their lives for this coun- try. Now they have a little bit of in- come. They are living on fixed in- comes. They are not in public housing, they are in some kind of assisted hous- ing. The way that hundreds of us go around and visit elderly housing when we need a vote at election time, those are the people whose increased rents are going to be used to balance the budget of this country. It is a shame that we should be taking what the gen- tleman from New York [Mr. S OLOMON ] earlier today claimed was a $500 tax cut. This is a $500 tax increase to the poorest of the poor. I ask you to please recognize that we need to invest in those people. We need to thank those people, and not con- demn them the way that this bill does. Vote for the Frank amendment. Have some compassion and some caring for the vulnerable people of this country.The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. FRANK ]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the ayes ap- peared to have it. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I demand a recorded vote, and pending that I make the point of order that a quorum is not present. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. F RANK ] will be postponed. The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the last word, and I yield to the gentlewoman from California [Mrs. S EASTRAND ] for pur- poses of a colloquy. Mrs. SEASTRAND. Mr. Chairman, earlier this week, the Committee on Science voted out a NASA authoriza- tion bill which included a $10 million line item for spaceports. Science, aeronautics, and technology is clearly an area where NASA has con- sistently performed well and thus in- cluded an allocation for spaceports. Spaceports, of course, are the wave of the future. In America we have a healthy booster and satellite market, plenty of launch bases, but not enough launch facilities. The development of launch facilities represents the missing piece of the commercial space puzzle, and America must go forward in sup- porting spaceports. /ballot1615 In America there are many States, including California, Florida, Alaska, New Mexico, Hawaii, Virginia, Colo- rado, that are involved or seek to be in- volved in the development of space- ports. It is my understanding that the Committee on Appropriations has re- placed the $10 million authorization with a $3 million appropriation going exclusively to Florida. Mr. Chairman, am I correct to as- sume replenishing this line item will now be done through the conference committee? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, the gentlewoman is generally cor- rect. There was an authorization of $10 million. That does not automatically lead to an appropriation of that total amount, as you know. The pressure that was involved in this bill with the tradeoffs between veterans and other accounts was that we had to limit some accounts; there was only $3 mil- lion made available. But indeed it is our intention to re- view these questions, and we look for- ward to the conference committee, and indeed, I have in mind the fact that the gentlewoman, and a couple of others, have several programs in mind that have locations that would be appro- priate.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7866 July 27, 1995 Mr. HAYWORTH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I commend the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] for the excellent work he has done in this appropriations bill. As indicated in de- bate this afternoon, it is a very, very difficult task the gentleman was con- fronted with. Obviously, there are difficult choices when we have these tight budgetary times. However, I do have serious con- cerns about funding for native Amer- ican housing programs. Mr. Chairman, I think it comes as no surprise that many other Members of this body share those concerns, includ- ing two of my colleagues on this side of the aisle, first, the distinguished gen- tleman from Nebraska [Mr. B EREUTER ]. Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HAYWORTH. I yield to the gen- tleman from Nebraska. (Mr. BEREUTER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.) Mr. BEREUTER. Mr. Chairman, I as- sociate myself with the comments of the gentleman from Arizona about In- dian housing and the comments I ex- pect to be made by the gentleman from Oklahoma [Mr. W ATTS ] expressing con- cerns over the funding level for Indian housing new construction in this meas- ure. Mr. Chairman, housing in Indian country is among the worst and most scarce in the Nation. There exists a great need for new construction, as there is a very limited stock of existing housing in Indian country. Still, this Member recognizes that we are facing severe fiscal constraints and that there is a need to scale back even on needed programs like this one. I am concerned about the degree of the cutback or the scale-back. Funding for the program the last sev- eral years has been at $280 million. The measure before us today provides for only $100 million. That is a nearly two- thirds reduction, and I believe it is too severe a cut. Mr. Chairman, I would encourage the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], the distinguished chairman of the sub- committee, and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], the ranking mem- ber, to seek to increase this funding level at conference. Having said that, I also want to say to the chairman and ranking member, as well as the members of the sub- committee, that I am appreciative of the $3 million in funding for the Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Program at HUD. I think this modest sum will le- verage up substantially and guarantee the private financing of nearly $37 mil- lion in housing loans for Indian fami- lies. One of the problems on Indian res- ervations has been, I think, potentially resolved by a change approved by this House in recent times; and this money will give us a chance to see if, in fact,we can solve this deficiency of loan funds being available to Indian families who live on Indian reservations. I believe this very limited amount of Federal funding is well spent, and it will be seen as well spent. I commend the appropriators for including it in this measure. Mr. WATTS of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. HAYWORTH. I yield to the gen- tleman from Oklahoma. Mr. WATTS of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair- man, while it is true that everyone must tighten their belts in order to balance the budget, Native Americans, the people who had the first Contract With America, have taken a hit which is more than we believe is their fair share. We are focused on special needs hous- ing, which is important, but no more important than living up to our treaty obligations and honoring our special trust relationship with the sovereign Indian Nations of this country. The need for additional and improved Indian housing is well documented. Considerable difficulties impede pri- vate financing of Indian housing. In- dian capital is scarce and frequently there is no security for financing. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. HAYWORTH ] has expired. (On request of Mr. L EWIS of Califor- nia, and by unanimous consent, Mr. HAYWORTH was allowed to proceed for 2 additional minutes.) Mr. HAYWORTH. I yield to the gen- tleman from Oklahoma. Mr. WATTS of Oklahoma. Mr. Chair- man, Indian capital is scarce, because frequently there is no security for mortgage loans or similar financing be- cause titles to most Indian land are held in trust by the United States. As a member of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, I can tell you that there are few commercial lenders in Indian country, and most lenders are reluctant to extend credit for housing on Indian lands. For these reasons, Indians have turned to various Federal housing programs for assist- ance, including those administered by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, HUD, and the Farmers Home Administration. Mr. Chairman, as we proceed in these fiscally lean times, we need to do so with careful contemplation and with- out acting too hastily to cut the means which will help the sovereign nations of this country to become truly self- sufficient and self-governing. Mr. HAYWORTH. Mr. Chairman, re- claiming my time, I would ask the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] if the funding level for Native American assisted housing in this bill represents the final number? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I appreciate the gentleman's question. I appreciate the gentleman from Arizona [Mr. H AYWORTH ] even more for his leadership on this issue and for expressing his concerns about this important matter.Mr. Chairman, I expect to work with the gentleman from Arizona as we go to conference. Where we can find money between accounts, we would certainly hope to improve upon this one and I appreciate the gentleman's assistance. Mr. CALLAHAN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I wish to engage the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] in a colloquy. I would like to address the EPA's Gulf of Mexico Program and the concern expressed about it in the committee report. Mr. Chairman, the committee report recommends that no funding be pro- vided for this program. As you know, I am a strong supporter, in fact, the fa- ther of the resolution that created the Gulf of Mexico Program, along with the gentleman from Texas [Mr. LAUGHLIN ]. I recognize and share the gentleman's concerns and the committee's concern that the EPA may overstep its bounds in implementing the program and that the individual States should maintain a stronger primary role in it. Since the bill itself does not address the Gulf Program, however, it is my under- standing that it can receive appropria- tions under this bill. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. CALLAHAN. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, the gentleman's understanding is correct. The committee is deeply con- cerned by the EPA's increasing role in management of the Gulf of Mexico Pro- gram and the potential encroachment of its management to the entire gulf watershed. It is the committee's intention to put the EPA on notice that it should con- duct a less intrusive program or face stronger budgetary scrutiny in the fu- ture. The committee recognizes the values of the Gulf of Mexico and be- lieves the program can be meaningful with proper management controls. Mr. Chairman, I assure the gen- tleman that we expect the Gulf of Mex- ico Program to be fully funded and I can personally attest that we will ad- dress this subject in the conference to ensure that our intent is clear. Mr. BARCIA. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I have a concern with the subcommittee's actions within NASA on an ongoing project, the Con- sortium for International Earth Science Information Network or CIESIN. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I am very familiar with the gen- tleman's concerns about NASA's con- tinuing role in the project known as CIESIN. The VA\u00b1HUD & Independent Agencies Appropriations Subcommit- tee has been very supportive of CIESIN in years past. The committee has rec- ognized the project's potential for theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7867 July 27, 1995 first-rate science of a type that had not previously been adequately explored. As the gentleman knows, we are hav- ing difficulty with this bill in terms of enough money to go around and so that is why we face the problem that we do at this moment. Mr. BARCIA. Mr. Chairman, my con- cern is that the action taken in this bill may unduly restrict NASA's abil- ity to provide continuing support for CIESIN. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, this bill does not provide $6 mil- lion directly for CIESIN as a part of Mission to Plant Earth. The project, in its current form, lacks current author- ization. Mr. BARCIA. Mr. Chairman, am I correct then that the gentleman's bill does not interfere with CIESIN's exist- ing contract which would expire in 1998? I known that the Committee on Science has just completed committee action that includes a provision allow- ing CIESIN to compete for NASA funds in fiscal year 1996 and would the appro- priations bill preclude that possibility? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the NASA authorization bill were to be enacted into law later this year, there is nothing in the appropria- tions bill that prejudices competitive success by CIESIN for NASA funding in future requests or for bids of proposal. It is not our intention to close the door, but indeed it is an authorization matter that is ahead of us. Mr. BARCIA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman for the committee's explanation. Also, I thank him for his gracious handling of our concerns and his kindness in the past. AMENDMENT NO. 1 OFFERED BY MR . KLUG Mr. KLUG. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. KLUG: Page 48, after line 25, insert the following new sec- tion: SEC. 211. DEMONSTRATION PROJECT FOR ELIMI- NATION OF TAKE-ONE-TAKE-ALL RE- QUIREMENT. In order to demonstrate the effects of eliminating the requirement under section 8(t) of the United States Housing Act of 1937, notwithstanding any assistance provided under any program under section 8 of such Act for the multifamily housing project con- sisting of the dwelling units located at 2401\u00b1 2479 Sommerset Circle, in Madison, Wiscon- sin, or on behalf of residents in such project, section 8(t) of such Act shall not apply with respect to such project. Mr. KLUG. Mr. Chairman, this amendment attempts to solve a prob- lem involving a section 8 housing project in my home community of Madison, WI. Let me say to my col- leagues in the room, this does not in- volve any money. And for those who you were not paying attention, let me say one more time, this does not in- volve any money. Mr. Chairman, this is a demonstra- tion project for elimination and excep-tion for what is essentially known as a current HUD regulation called take one, take all. This involves a housing project, a section 8/Mod Rehab project which in recent years has experienced financial problems, a high crime rate and corresponding drug problems. The project is going to be foreclosed on in the next several weeks and with- out this waiver, my hometown faces the severe and difficult choice of decid- ing either to make it entirely a for- profit housing project, cutting out low- income residents, or to essentially stay with the current policy of only allow- ing section 8 participants, in which case we may find ourselves back in the exact same cycle that we are trying to get out of. Under this policy, take one, take all requires a landlord who takes one, who accepts one section 8 tenant to accept all the section 8 renters. This amendment enjoys bipartisan support back in my home State of Wis- consin, including Governor Tommy Thompson, Senators H ERB KOHL and RUSS FEINGOLD , who are Democrats, Democrat Dane County Executive Rick Phelps, town of Madison Chairman Mike Theisen. H.R. 3838, last year's housing bill, contained the repeal of take one, take all, but unfortunately though it passed in this body in July of last year, al- most to the date, it never made it through the Senate. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO] and the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. L EACH ], and also the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], for their understanding of the situation back in Wisconsin and for being sup- portive of this effort. And also for the gentlewoman from Ohio Ms. P RYCE ], who in the past has tried to fix similar problems in legislation. Mr. Chairman, in order, again, for this project to go forward and to avoid a situation where we may see many poor families thrown out in the street, my home State of Wisconsin will need this waiver. It is my understanding that the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO] will fix this problem later in the fall, but unfortunately the finan- cial and judicial timelines facing this project will not allow us to take advan- tage of those opportunities under the leadership of the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO] unless we are able to accept this amendment today in the House. Mr. Chairman, one more time for all of my colleagues who may not have been paying attention when we started this discussion, this does not involve any money. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I listened with care to the presentation of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG] and the special manner in which his request has been treated in this appropriations bill./ballot1630 Now, what I find very unusual about it is that this really is not a matter for the Committee on Appropriations. In fact, as I listened to the gentleman concerning how you wished to handle the section 8 certificates, and I believe you are from Madison, WI, this is real- ly a matter for the authorizers. In fact, you could bring a separate bill to the floor, and what I find really amazing is that the Committee on Rules allowed you to do this and you have been given a special waiver to be included in the appropriations bill for a given project when, in fact, we cannot even get in- cluded in the rule governing the debate on this bill major programs, not just a project here or there, but major pro- grams that we are being denied the ability to debate, such as the drug elimination program which I brought up this morning during the debate on the rule. So I would like to ask the gentleman how is it that you were given this real- ly quite unique opportunity? I think you were one of only two such special inclusions in the appropriations bill. What presentation did you make to the Committee on Rules and how were you able to get this included? I am very curious. Mr. KLUG. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gen- tleman from Wisconsin. Mr. KLUG. You would have to ask the Committee on Rules why they de- cided to allow the merits of this pro- gram to prevail in their deliberations. But I testified in front of the Commit- tee on Rules yesterday, and they though it was an appropriate discus- sion to have on the floor, because what we are really interested in, if the gen- tlewoman will continue to yield for a few more seconds, what I think the committee is interested in, as is the Committee on Appropriations ulti- mately, the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO], is to make sure we have an opportunity to change the way we have handled section 8 projects across the country, and I think, given what the gentleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO] is attempting to do later this fall, it is absolutely appropriate to try one dem- onstration project to see if it works to build more momentum to change the authorizing legislation. Ms. KAPTUR. Reclaiming my time, I find it interesting your project is de- fined as a demonstration program. We made a special policy in the Committee on Appropriations we were not going to allow any demonstration programs in the bill. You must feel you really have a lot of pull over there at the Commit- tee on Rules because, in fact, your pro- posal here is totally out of step with every other Member of this institution but for one other. I find it quite interesting. Let me ask you, in the demonstration program that you are proposing be included in this appropriation bill, is your programCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7868 July 27, 1995 authorized? You mentioned the gen- tleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO] wants to do it later in the year. Is your program authorized that you are ask- ing for? Mr. KLUG. No. It is not authorized. Ms. KAPTUR. Let me further ask the gentleman then, what gives you special privilege on this floor over any other Member? Mr. KLUG. I went to the Committee on Rules, if the gentlewoman will yield further, and the Committee on Rules voted to allow my amendment to get to the floor. It is no special privilege. It is only the vote of the Committee on Rules which, as you know, determines any amendments which may be brought to the floor, and earlier today, this House supported the rule that came out of the Committee on Rules. So the House essentially has already signed off on the opportunity to bring this to the floor to be debated. Ms. KAPTUR. I think the gentleman should think long and hard about what he is doing because you are taking a personal privilege, in a sense, going to the Committee on Rules, and obviously your party controls that committee, but for a special project in one place in this country that is unauthorized. You are being given a special privilege when Members here on this floor are being denied the opportunity to debate major portions of this bill which apply to everyone. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gen- tleman from Massachusetts. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. The next time you want to fight drugs, you are going to have to ask a Republican to do it for you. Then maybe you will get permission to get your amendment up here. Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman for that advice. The amazing thing is I am not fight- ing for my district. I am fighting for 435 congressional districts. I asked for the opportunity to be heard. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentlewoman will yield further, you may need three or four Republicans. Ms. KAPTUR. Maybe I need a few more. I thank the gentleman for that good advice. I would just say to the gentleman this is the type of insertion in a bill that breaks down camaraderie, and the proposal that I want to debate on this floor had bipartisan support in the committee. It is a program that has been operating since 1988. We are being denied that oppor- tunity, and you are being given special privilege. I really think it is wrong of the Committee on Rules. Mr. HAYWORTH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant op- position to the amendment offered by my friend, the gentleman from Wiscon- sin. I do this without venom or vitriol. This is simply not the right place orthe right time to be dealing with this issue. As the gentleman himself pointed out, this subcommittee, ultimately in full committee and in other legislation in that jurisdiction, is the place to deal with this. Certainly, the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. P RYCE ] made that clear in the previous Congress. I listened with interest to my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin, chron- icle the difficulties in the other body, but I believe a full and open debate as to the merits or demerits of this policy is required under the jurisdiction rath- er than in this appropriations process. So I simply rise in reluctant opposi- tion. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Mr. Chair- man, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Mr. Chair- man, I listened to the gentleman's dis- sertation of the amendment that he has on the floor, and it is my apprecia- tion this amendment is all legislation and no appropriation. Can the gentleman legislate on an appropriation bill? The CHAIRMAN. All points of order are waived against this amendment. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Who waived? Because the gentlewoman from Ohio has a great amendment, and her amendment is certainly an appropria- tion and not a legislation and not deal- ing with legislation but appropriation. The CHAIRMAN. The House waived all points of order against this amend- ment by adopting the resolution gov- erning consideration of this bill. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Are there any other amendments that the House waived all points of order other than the gentleman's amendment? The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, there were two amendments protected. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Can the gentleman inquire in terms of which amendments they are? I mean, because the gentlewoman and I am having some confusion. The CHAIRMAN. If the gentleman will let the Chair answer the question, the gentleman can look in the report of the Committee on Rules accompanying House Resolution 201. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. I am try- ing to understand the rules. I am new here. I do not recall the House, is that rule from the Committee on Rules be- cause you said the House waived the rules? I do not recall voting on waiving these rules other than through the rules that we adopted that I voted against. So you are talking about this rule came from the Committee on Rules? The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will suspend. When the House adopted the resolu- tion reported by the Committee on Rules, the House waived the points of order against the gentleman's amend- ment. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Which other amendments did we waive?The CHAIRMAN. As the Chair has in- dicated to the gentleman, he can find that information in the report. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. You are not privy to that information? The CHAIRMAN. Yes, and so is the gentleman from Louisiana. Is there further discussion on the amendment? Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the req- uisite number of words. I wonder if, given the situation which has been acknowledged, and I appre- ciate the forthrightness of the gen- tleman from Arizona [Mr. H AYWORTH ] with regard to this amendment, I do not disagree with the purposes that the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG] has filed this amendment; in fact, I would support the underlying purposes for which the gentleman from Wiscon- sin [Mr. K LUG] has attempted to change some of the housing authoriza- tion language that is necessary to get his amendment in proper order. The fact of the matter is the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] was trying to get an amendment, which I also sup- port, to continue a program that has been funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development for 5 years. Because the authorizing committee never held a hearing and never wrote a bill, that program is no longer author- ized. As a result, when we tried to just continue funding for a program that al- ready has funding, it was denied be- cause a point of order could be raised against the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ]. So I wonder whether or not we might, if I sought or if the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ], I say to the gen- tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG], if I could just get your attention for a mo- ment and perhaps that of the gen- tleman from New York [Mr. L AZIO] as well, and it is hard to get the attention of the gentleman from New York [Mr. LAZIO] on some of these housing issues. But in any event, I wonder if the gen- tlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] were to ask unanimous consent to be able to bring her amendment forward, given the kind of situation we are in at the moment, whether or not we might be able to get her amendment brought up under UC and have an opportunity to debate the drug elimination program as well. I would hope that maybe we could find some support by the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG] for those who perhaps would oppose his amend- ment because of the way it was brought forward who might be inclined to support his amendment if the amendment offered by the gentle- woman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] could be debated as well. I wonder if the gen- tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG] might have a comment on that. Mr. KLUG. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7869 July 27, 1995 Mr. KLUG. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, with whom I have worked closely over the last several weeks. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. I appreciate it very much. I support his underlying amendment. I understand that. Mr. KLUG. That is a discussion I had with the Committee on Rules. I have absolutely no control over what the Committee on Rules did except to make my case like other Members. Imagine that, when a member of the majority party asks the Committee on Rules for an amendment, it is actually approved. Obviously, it never happened any time in the last 4 years. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. I appreciate what the gentleman is sug- gesting. I am not going back to the Committee on Rules. I am suggesting if the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. KLUG] were to use the influence that he demonstrated so capably to be able to get this amendment included in the bill to begin with, if he could use that same kind of influence to allow for a unanimous consent to be made in order so that the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] could bring her bill for- ward, her amendment forward, there might be a great deal of inclination for people on our side of the asile to sup- port the amendment if the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] could be made in order and he could use his influence to con- vince people on the other side to not oppose her amendment for the purposes of this debate. Mr. KLUG. I will be happy to have the discussion with a member of the Committee on Rules, but I do not see any on the floor right now. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. I do not think we need the Committee on Rules to bring it up under unanimous consent. We can ask for unanimous consent. I am just asking you to go to work. If somebody opposes it, that will answer the question as to whether or not we are going to oppose you. Mr. KLUG. I have no objections. That is not my not decision. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that we be allowed to bring up the Kap- tur amendment with regard to the drug elimination program. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I am not even sure that is appro- priate. It certainly does not fit the dis- cussion. For now, I have to object. The CHAIRMAN. Objection is heard. Mr. FRANK of Massachusetts. If the gentleman will yield, I just wanted to make the point there was some ques- tion as to when the authorization lapsed. Someone had suggested that authorization for the drug elimination program had lapsed a long time earlier. The information I received from the very able staff of the minority on the housing subcommittee is that, in fact, this was authorized through 1994. The question was whether this had been some previous problem. It is thefailure of the Congress this year to au- thorize the drug elimination grants that caused the dilemma the gentle- woman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] has been caught in. That is, through the end of last year it was authorized. So we were not previously appropriating for an unauthorized program, and it was the failure of the housing sub- committee to do anything this year that resulted in that problem. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. That is correct. I would look forward to working with the gentleman from California [Mr. LEWIS] to see whether we might work out a unanimous consent that would comply with the rules of the House to allow the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. KAPTUR ] to offer her amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. KLUG.

Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the last word. I would like to have a colloquy with my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. I know that the gen- tleman and I are very anxious to make a contribution to getting our Members out of here as early as possible, either tonight, or maybe even early tonight, but also early tomorrow, if we need to go over to tomorrow. In connection with that, I understand that there has been some effort made to work out time limitations on a number of the amendments; is that correct? And if it is, I will outline those that I under- stand. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LEWIS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that we have made some offer with reference to having some agreement relative to time. Mr. LEWIS of California. It is my un- derstanding, Mr. Chairman, that there are a series of six amendments where there are tentatively agreed time limi- tations. They would be amendment No. 64 by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. STOKES ]. The time limit would be 10 minutes, divided equally. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, that is correct. Mr. LEWIS of California. And amend- ment No. 65, offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] which strikesCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7873 July 27, 1995 delays, a 10-minute limitation divided equally. Mr. STOKES. That is correct. Mr. LEWIS of California. Item No. 69 by the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO ] dealing with the homeless, a limitation of 40 minutes. Mr. STOKES. The gentleman is cor- rect. Mr. LEWIS of California. And item No. 12, Mr. Chairman, the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massa- chusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ], 20 minutes, 10 minutes on each side. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LEWIS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. This is the first I have heard of this limitation, just in this last 30 seconds. I will have to check with the gentle- woman from California [Ms. W ATERS ] who cosponsored the amendment with me. If we could have a minute or two to consult, we will get back to the gen- tleman. Mr. LEWIS of California. In the meantime, Mr. Chairman, let me com- plete my list. Item No. 44, by the gen- tleman from Colorado [Mr. H EFLEY ], a 10-minute limitation, 5 minutes on each side. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, that is my understanding. Mr. LEWIS of California. And Ms. KAPTUR of Ohio, drug elimination, a limitation of 20 minutes. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, that is correct. Mr. LEWIS of California. I should mention that there has been an indica- tion on item 64, the first item of Mr. STOKES , and item 2, there has been some indication that there could be points of order on those two items. I think that is a part of the understand- ing as well. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I am sorry, if the gentleman could repeat that. Mr. LEWIS of California. When the amendments are called up. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, I un- derstand with reference to the Kennedy amendment, the gentleman would agree upon 20 minutes on each side. That would be acceptable to our side. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, how about 40 minutes? Twenty minutes on each side? Mr. STOKES. Twenty on each side, Mr. Chairman. Mr. LEWIS of California. I will try not to use my time. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, with reference to item 64, do I understand that the gentleman is waiving a point of order so we might discuss that mat- ter for 10 minutes; is that it? Mr. LEWIS of California. Which mat- ter is the gentleman referring to? Mr. STOKES. Amendment No. 64. Mr. LEWIS of California. It is my un- derstanding, Mr. Chairman, that thereis a request to reserve the right to a point of order on two of the two items, No. 64 and No. 2. Mr. STOKES. That is correct. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I know the gentleman wants to discuss it, and I will do everything I can to see that that occurs. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I ask unanimous consent that the House accept these time limitations as they have just been outlined. The CHAIRMAN. Would the gen- tleman please restate his unanimous- consent request? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I ask unanimous consent that all debate on the following amendments and all amendments thereto be given specific time limitations as outlined in each of these items: On item No. 64, 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side; 65, 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side; 69, 40 minutes, 20 minutes on each side; 12, 40 minutes, 20 minutes on each side; 44, 10 minutes, 5 minutes on each side; and No. 2, 20 minutes, 10 minutes on each side. I would state with that that Members have requested the reservation of points of order possible on item 64 and item 2. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I ask unanimous consent that, if there are rollcalls on these amend- ments, as we proceed, that they would all be rolled over and taken at the end of the discussion. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has that authority. Unanimous consent would not be needed for that. The CHAIRMAN. Are there other amendments to title II? AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MS . KAPTUR Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment, No. 2. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Ms. K APTUR : Page 26, after line 13, insert the following new item: DRUG ELIMINATION GRANTS FOR LOW -INCOME HOUSING For grants to public housing agencies for use in eliminating drug-related crime in pub- lic housing projects authorized by the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 11901\u00b111908), and for drug in- formation clearinghouse services authorized by the Drug-Free Public Housing Act of 1988 (42 U.S.C. 11921\u00b111925), $290,000,000, to remain available until expended. Page 64, line 16, before the last comma in- sert ``(reduced by $34,500,000)''. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve a point of order against the amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from California reserves a point of order. /ballot1745 The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] will be recog-nized for 10 minutes, and the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] will be recognized for 10 minutes in op- position. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ]. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, first let me say to the chairman of the subcommittee, no one could be more cordial or helpful than the gentleman has been in committee and in subcommittee as we develop these extremely complex bills, with lots of pressure from many outside in- terests, as we saw in that last vote. My problem is not with the commit- tee, Mr. Chairman, my problem is with the Committee on Rules in our at- tempts to get a freestanding vote on this exceedingly important question of the continuation of the drug elimi- nation program in and around our pub- lic housing projects, which affects al- most every single metropolitan area and many smaller towns and commu- nities in this country. Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong opposition to the rule, because my amendment is one of its victims. We all know that there is no greater scourge affecting our communities than the drug scourge. It has been this way for a while. However, this bill, for the first time since 1988, completely strikes out all of the money for our drug elimi- nation efforts in nearby neighborhoods around public housing. The Committee on Rules refused to make in order my amendment, which would maintain last year's level of sup- port, which is about $290 million for drug elimination in 1996, and we did so in a budget-neutral way. We trans- ferred money in the amendment from FEMA, the Federal Emergency Man- agement Agency, so it is budget neu- tral. Let me say again, this program has existed and has been functioning since 1988. It has an excellent track record. It has helped every community in this country deal with the kind of cancer that is spreading throughout our neighborhoods because of these gang leaders and drug lords associated with drugs. Mr. Chairman, in a few moments the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], our distinguished chairman, will insist on his point of order against my amendment. I have a hunch that the Chair will rule that I cannot bring up my amendment for a full debate before this body. It is my intention to then appeal the Chair's ruling, and a motion will be made to table my appeal. I ask my colleagues to please vote no on the motion to table the appeal, because in effect, that will be the only vote that we have on saving this very worthy ini- tiative. I guess my basic question, Mr. Chair- man, is why should we pull the rug out from under the citizens of our country by taking away the only program that exists to fight drugs and crime in some of the most fragile neighborhoods inCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7874 July 27, 1995 this Nation? To make matters worse, if my amendment does not prevail, what ultimately happens is as this fiscal year winds down and the next fiscal year begins, the money that is so- called being saved, and I put that word in quotes, the money that would be taken from these very worthy initia- tives from coast-to-coast, will be frittered away on tax breaks that will be given to the privileged few. That will not be done in our commit- tee, that will be done over in the Com- mittee on Ways and Means. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, there is really no sav- ings as a result of what is being done here. We are eliminating an exceed- ingly effective program. Mr. Chairman, let me point out that this program, and I said to the major- ity leader just now, it is amazing what happens in politics, I am defending a program that was pioneered by Jack Kemp when he was HUD Secretary. This has had broad bipartisan support over the years, and has really helped our community stem the drug tide, be- cause, as we all know, it is not re- stricted to one neighborhood. The drug lords and those that they hire, they move across communities. They move into the suburbs, into the city. Since 1989 HUD was given a helping hand to hundreds and hundred of our mayors in towns and police forces across this country. In my own town of Toledo, OH, a medium-size city, our Toledo Police Department saw a 20 per- cent decrease in just 1 year in drug ac- tivity in those areas that received help from this program. Yet, the appropria- tions bill recommended zero funding, zero funding in this program that is doing so much to effectively combat what drug lords and gang violence is doing all over this country. I literally walked through the streets of Chicago when Congressman Charlie Hayes served in this body at a time when there were snipers on the roofs of some of the public housing projects in Chicago, projects being controlled by drug lords. As a result of this very wor- thy effort, that does not happen, that does not happen to the extent that it used to. Mr. Chairman, what is really amaz- ing is how we could be abandoning a program that has been as universally successful as this one, in giving our mayors, our police departments, our citizens the necessary tools to fight crime. It seems to me we cannot afford to continue them. Let me remind my colleagues, my amendment would pay for itself through an offset of $34 million from FEMA's disaster assistance account, because this particular program only spends out at the rate of 7 percent a year, and it seems we have found money for everything from the space station to disasters everywhere in the Nation. There could be no greater dis- aster than what is happening in our communities as a result of the drug trade.One of the reasons I really beg spe- cial consideration here, I offered an amendment in the full committee on this very subject. We got bipartisan support, we came within 5 votes of car- rying the amendment, there were 16 Members who were not in the commit- tee when we took the vote. Any objec- tion that could have existed to the amendment as originally offered was worked out. We went to the Committee on Rules, we made our presentation, and I thought we would be granted the op- portunity to offer this amendment. The FEMA account has been dipped into for other purposes since we held that vote in committee. Thus, it seems to me that for $34 million in the next cycle, we have a very worthy proposal that deserves the consideration of our col- leagues. Mr. Chairman, I also have a list here that includes communities across the country. Before Members vote on the motion to table the appeal, I want them to come up to me and take a look at this list. Columbus, OH, gets over $1 million a year. Every community of the leadership of this Congress receives help. The community of chairman of the Committee on Rules, Albany, NY, receives help in his program. We can go coast to coast. Every single district in this country benefits from this pro- gram. I would remind my colleagues from the other side of the aisle that this is not a partisan issue. Let me quote what Jack Kemp said in 1991 when he was visiting a project in one of our Na- tion's major cities. He said, ``Our drug elimination funding represents a sub- stantial commitment'' by the then Bush administration, ``to rid public housing of the scourge of drugs and drug-related crime. Two years ago the bush administration announced a sub- stantial moral and financial commit- ment to return public housing neigh- borhoods to the families for whom they were intended. Today this effort is showing significant results.'' I agree with Mr. Kemp, Mr. Chair- man. We, as Members of this House, should do everything possible to help our local communities combat the scourge of drugs. I find it the height of lunacy to eliminate an effort that has proven itself in city after city just in order to bankroll through tax breaks largely the Fortune 500 big daddies that will get plenty of good treatment here, come the end of the year. My colleagues should know that if my amendment is ruled out of order, I will appeal the ruling of the Chair. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote no on any subsequent motions to table my appeal of the ruling of the Chair. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. F IELDS ]. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me, and for all of her efforts she has put into this amendment. Mr. Chairman, this is a very impor- tant amendment. If we look at theproblems we have in our public housing system across the country, we will find there still exists today, though I think there are Members of Congress, based upon the way we are moving in this legislation, who do not believe that; but I can tell the Members, coming from a district that has a sizeable amount of public housing, there are still problems within the public hous- ing system. For us to sit here or stand here today and not consider this amendment to me would be absolutely unbelievable. We have already cut out drug free schools and communities out of our schools. We have taken drug education funding out of the school system. Now we are coming to the public housing and taking drug prevention programs and elimination programs out of it. I just do not understand how that makes sense. Mr. Chairman, in Louisiana, for ex- ample, this amendment, if it is not passed, will cost Louisiana somewhere in the neighborhood of about $600,000. We have big housing facilities like the one in New Orleans, LA, for example, DESIRE projects. They are working hard every day to try to eliminate the drug problem that they have. The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], insist on his point of order? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve my point of order. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] is recog- nized for 10 minutes on the amend- ment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, let me say to my colleague, the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ], if I though we were eliminating pro- grams that are attempting to control the drug problem in public housing, I would agree with her. But I do not be- lieve that is the case. I know that the gentlewoman will recall that during the rescission process, we put sizeable numbers of dollars in the public hous- ing modernization accounts. There is $2.5 billion in this bill, another $6 bil- lion in the pipeline, and are providing the kind of flexibility that suggests that these drug elimination efforts should take place through public hous- ing modernization. The President just signed the rescis- sion bill today. Within that bill there is the authorization to carry forward that sort of activity, so I feel very, very strongly that while there may be this understanding between us, there is certainly no disagreement regarding the importance and the priority of drug elimination efforts. It is my own view that the Depart- ment of Housing has not always effec- tively carried forward efforts that the Congress outlined for them to carry forward. We are giving them some new direction in this process. We hope to put a different kind of pressure on, and see if it works better. These programs work well in some locations and in other locations they do not work very well.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7875 July 27, 1995 Further, Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentlewoman, she and I do have a very fine working relationship. As she knows, she made a personal appeal regarding $10 million that involves a health professionals scholarship pro- gram, and frankly, I thought the argu- ment was logical, and in my amend- ment earlier today, put that money back in. In this case, there is a very specific authorization for an appropriations bill here in the rescission package that al- lows another approach in terms of drug elimination within housing moderniza- tion. I really believe that there is a need to shake this agency, and take those agency subheads over there and rattle them a bit. In no way, shape, or form would the gentlewoman or I take a position that was in opposition to drug elimination grants. POINT OF ORDER Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I make a point of order against the amendment, because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriations bill, and therefore violates clause 2 of rule XXI. The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentle- woman desire to be heard on the point of order? Ms. KAPTUR. Yes, I do, Mr. Chair- man. I respectfully ask for the Chair's ruling on that. The CHAIRMAN. Does any Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. I would like to be heard on the point of order, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I support the provi- sion of the gentlewoman in this bill, and I think the point of order is not ap- propriate, given all of the other consid- erations that have been contained in this rule that is before the House of Representatives. I would further point out that the gentleman from California suggests that the funds for this program could be contained in the HUD modernization program. I would just point out to the gentleman that that program has been cut fully by 30 percent. To suggest that we are going to be able to take money from the drug elimination program and take it out of the modernization fund is complete folly, so I would object to the point of order based on the fact that this whole thing is complete folly on the part of the gentleman from Cali- fornia. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I would suggest there is $2.5 bil- lion for public housing modernization in this bill and there is $6 billion in the pipeline of unexpended, unobligated funds. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. I would just point out that HUD mod- ernization funds are much like an air- craft carrier. The fact of the matter is there are billions and billions of dollars in the Armed Services budget that go for programs that are going to be re- quiring these funds over a period of time. You cannot build bricks and mor-tar overnight. It takes a while. There- fore, the funds end up in the pipeline. That is no excuse for taking a short- sighted approach. Once again, it demonstrates the fact that the Committee on Appropriations is no place to authorize funds, because the Committee on Appropriations does not understand how HUD moderniza- tion works. HUD modernization draws dollars over a long period of time. They see the money in the pipeline, they say ``Let's go cut it,'' but the fact of the matter is those dollars go to specific projects that need to be modernized, and should not be in competition with drug elimination funding. /ballot1800 The CHAIRMAN. Are there other Members who wish to be heard on the point of order? Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I would like to be heard. The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman may proceed on the point of order. Ms. KAPTUR. Yes, Mr. Chairman, that is what I would like to do. I want to say, first of all, that I think that the work that the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. L EWIS] did in helping us to re- store the health education scholarships for nurses, for occupational therapists, and so forth, a $10 million program that has existed since the early 1980's, was right for America and it was the proper thing to do with some of the dollars that were given to our commit- tee when other committees worked out their bottom line numbers. On this particular one, as I men- tioned, I am not blaming the gen- tleman personally for this. I am ex- ceedingly disappointed in the Rules Committee based on what happened. Mr. M CINNIS. Regular order. The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman must confine her remarks to the point of order. Regular order has been de- manded. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, what does that mean? The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman's remarks should be relative to the point of order rather than the other subject matter being discussed. Regular order has been demanded. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I am talking about the point of order; am I not? The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman must speak to whether or not this is an authorized appropriation. Ms. KAPUTR. Mr. Chairman, let me say that this program has existed since 1988, and when the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG] was on the floor a little earlier, the gentleman was ask- ing for a demonstration project that did not even get in the bill. It was not even in the appropriations bill. To me, I am talking about a program that has been on the books since 1988, with a track record, and all of the other pro- grams in the bill are not authorized ei- ther, and yet we are appropriating dol- lars for them. Mr. Chairman, I would like to know by what criteria the Rules Committeedecided when things were not author- ized what would they put in the bill and why I am classified as unauthor- ized The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is not in a position to state the motivations of the Rules Committee. The gentle- woman should confine her remarks to the point of order which is before the body. Does the gentlewoman wish to fur- ther comment on the point of order? Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I am a bit befuddled here in trying to under- stand by what criteria in this point of order we are ruled out of order, saying we are unauthorized when, in fact, ev- erything else in the bill is not author- ized either. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has yet to rule. Ms. KAPTUR. I have a hunch what the Chair is going to do, Mr. Chairman. I have kind of been forewarned, and I am trying to get a definition of why we would be excluded. I hope when the Chair rules he will so state that reason, especially in relation to other pro- grams in the bill that are included but are not authorized. The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order. Mr. LEWIS. By way of clarification, Mr. Chairman, I want to make sure the House understands that the rule states in pertinent part that no amendment to a general appropriations bill shall be in order if changing existing law. The amendment goes to a program whose authorization expired in fiscal year 1994. The program is not author- ized and, therefore, the point of order, and that is what I am asking the Chair to rule upon. The CHAIRMAN. Are there other Members who wish to be heard on the point of order? Mrs. CLAYTON. Yes, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will hear arguments from Members on the point of order. The gentlewoman from North Carolina may proceed. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask the Chair again to further explain the point of order here. The distinction for the clause that is written into the language said all of these appropriations are subject to au- thorization, so all of them technically expired. What date did they expire? The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman wish to be heard further? Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to respond to the gentle- woman's question. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, let me make the point. He made the point that the reason for the point of order was that bills were expired in 1994. I am raising the question, then, all of these bills in the language, according to the drafting of the legislation are subject to authorization. All bills have expired. The question is raised why not a point of order, if that is the reason on all of the bills that we have here? The CHAIRMAN. Is the gentlewoman making a parliamentary inquiry?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7876 July 27, 1995 Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, if I need to, I will have it as a parliamen- tary inquiry. I though I was asking the gentleman from California. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will re- spond to the gentlewoman's question when the Chair rules on the point of order. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, I was asking the chairman of the subcommit- tee, sir, in all deference. The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from California wish to be heard fur- ther on the point of order? Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Chairman, those items within this bill that have been protected by the Rules Committee can go appropriately forward. This is an item that has not been protected by the Rules Committee and, therefore, is subject to a point of order. I might say, Mr. Chairman, that we learned this process during the past several sessions that I have been in the Congress. The CHAIRMAN. Are there other Members who wish to be heard on the point of order? Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I desire to be heard on the point of order. Some people are sitting here wonder- ing what is going on. Let me tell you what is going on. The gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. K LUG] came to the floor and attempted to have an amendment passed that would allow apartment owners to have some section 8 but not all section 8. That was not authorized by anybody. He legislated on the appro- priation. Mr. M CINNIS. Mr. Chairman, regular order. The CHAIRMAN. Regular order is de- manded. Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, this speaks to the point of order. He went to the Committee on Rules. The CHAIRMAN. Regular order is de- manded. The gentlewoman should con- fine her remarks specifically to the point of order, as to whether this amendment is authorized. Whatever ac- tivity on any other amendment is not relevant. Ms. WATERS. I think it is relevant. The CHAIRMAN. Not in the eyes of the Chair. Ms. WATERS. I will try. The fact of the matter is it is not au- thorized because we have had no legis- lation in committee to do any author- izations and so no one else has been au- thorized. But a cute little trick took place and the Committee on Rules waived for those they wanted to waive for and they are denying an oppor- tunity. Whether you say I am speaking to the point of order or not, I am, and it is unfair, and I do not expect that from this chairman because he usually is fair. I would ask him to withdraw his point of order and let the gentlewoman take up this most important measure because she has not had an opportunity to have it authorized. The CHAIRMAN. Are there other Members who wish to be heard on the point of order?Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Mr. Chair- man, very briefly, I would like to make one or two points as relates to the point of order. First of all, I think the gentle- woman's amendment is in order, one, because it is not legislating according to the rules of the House on an appro- priation bill. It is simply providing for an appropriation. It is taking money out of title III of this appropriations bill and it is putting it in title II of this appropriations bill. Title III of this appropriation bill deals with FEMA, so she is simply taking money out of FEMA and putting it into the drug elimination portion. The last point I would like to make, Mr. Chairman, is that in doing that it makes this amendment budget neutral, it does not add any additional dollars to the bill, so therefore I think the gen- tlewoman's amendment should be made in order. Mr. M CINNIS. Mr. Chairman, regular order. The CHAIRMAN (Mr. C OMBEST ). The gentleman's statement was pertinent to the point of order. Are there other Members who wish to be heard on the point of order? If not, the Chair is prepared to rule. The statutory authority cited in the amendment extends only through fiscal 1994. Absent citation to law extending the authorization through fiscal 1996, the Chair must sustain the point of order. The fact that other waivers have been granted to other amendments is not relevant. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary inquiry. The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman will state it. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, am I correct in understanding that the rul- ing of the Chair would create a situa- tion where we would thus be denied an opportunity to have a vote on the di- rect question of should we sustain this program for fiscal year 1996? Is that the net effect? The CHAIRMAN. The Chair's ruling indicates that the amendment is no longer before the Committee of the Whole. Ms. KAPTUR. So if the Chair recalls earlier today when the chairman of the Committee on Rules was on the floor and told me that this was an open rule and thus I would have the opportunity to offer my amendment and said I would be able to do that, now, it is proven, what he said has not happened. I have not been offered the opportunity to have a full debate on my amendment here on the floor and be given an up-or- down vote on it. Is that not correct? The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has in- terpreted the amendment consistent with the rules of the House and the special order. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, tell me would this be in order: We had some conversations here with the leadership on the other side of the aisle and some of the folks here. What if I were towithdraw my amendment at this point perhaps for an hour or two as we are proceeding through the remainder of title II, reserving the right to bring it up at the end of title II? That would give us more time to dis- cuss this with the full committee chair. It would give us time to discuss with the majority leader since he came over here and talked to us about it. Would that be in order at this point? The CHAIRMAN. At this point, the amendment is not before the commit- tee for withdrawal. If the gentlewoman wants to re-offer an amendment at some point, the Chair would have to rule at that time. Are there other amendments to title II? Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished gentleman from our neighboring State of New York, the chairman of the Banking Subcommit- tee on Housing and Community Oppor- tunity. I would like to direct this to the gen- tleman. As the gentleman is aware, I considered offering an amendment to the fiscal year 1996 VA\u00b1HUD appropria- tions bill to give local officials the flexibility they need to select those programs or services most deserving of community development block grants. As the gentleman knows, current law burdens the CDBG program with ar- chaic rules and regulations, tying the hands of local officials and subverting the true intention of block grants. In many cases these regulations preclude the award of grants to those programs most deserving of support. Especially in an era of limited budgets, this Con- gress should not severely limit the ability of local officials to direct these limited funds to the areas of greatest need. My amendment was designed to re- place section 105(a) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974. This portion of the act lists 25 eligible activities, and imposes a bewildering, Byzantine array of restrictions and limitations that I believe as a former elected official confuses and constricts the use of Federal funds by local elect- ed officials most familiar with their urban challenges. Mr. Chairman, I fully understand that my proposed amendment would have placed legislative language in an appropriations bill. Nevertheless I be- lieve it is absolutely essential to cut the bureaucratic red tape strangling our communities' ability to respond to local problems. However, before I of- fered the amendment, I had an enlight- ened conversation with the gentleman form New York that I believe should be shared with other Members of this House. May I ask the same questions of the representative from the Empire State? Mr. LAZIO of New York. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will yield, I would be happy to answer his ques- tions.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7877 July 27, 1995 Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. To the gentleman, is the Banking Sub- committee on Housing and Community Opportunity presently reviewing pro- posals to streamline the CDBG process? Mr. LAZIO of New York. Yes, I would say to the gentleman from Pennsylva- nia, whom I respect and admire, that I am currently preparing a chairman's mark that among other things will at- tempt to simplify the eligible activi- ties under the community development program into 5 broad program param- eters that will include some of the ac- tivities noted in your withdrawn amendment. We recognize that the Federal Government in forming part- nerships with the State and local gov- ernments must develop user-friendly programs that provide as much flexi- bility as possible to coordinate and im- plement successful community devel- opment programs that actually meet the real needs of the community. This new approach will help communities target funds to help more low and mod- erate income families. Mr. ENGLISH of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I would ask when the gen- tleman expects to complete this bill? Mr. LAZIO of New York. The mark should be completed soon. I will be happy to discuss details of the commu- nity development aspect with the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania and work with him to help satisfy his concerns. I expect the subcommittee markup and passage to occur sometime during this session. /ballot1815 I would like to thank the gentleman for taking the time to share this valu- able information, and I commend him for taking these important steps to strengthen and improve the CDBG pro- gram. Mr. Chairman, I would also like to thank the distinguished gentleman from California, Mr. L EWIS, chairman of this subcommittee on appropria- tions, for allowing me to enter this at this time, and I commend the chairman and the committee for providing full funding in this bill for the Community Development Block Grant Program at last year's level. AMENDMENT NO . 64 OFFERED BY MR . STOKES Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. S TOKES : On page 30, after ``1988,'' on line 6, insert: ``and for the fair housing initiatives program as authorized by the Housing and Commu- nity Development Act of 1987,''. Mr. LAZIO of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve a point of order. The CHAIRMAN. A point of order is reserved. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. The point of order raised against my amendment raises the precise question that has been raised here by the gentle-woman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] all day long. In my case, it is more egregious. I am the ranking minority member of this subcommittee. I have sat in hearings for 4 months, day in and day out. I have never missed a meeting. I have at- tended every meeting. I bring to the floor today an amend- ment that I asked the Committee on Rules to protect; it was not protected. I was here this morning when the chairman of the Committee on Rules said the same thing in my presence that he said in the presence of the gen- tlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ]. That was that the rule did not prohibit any of us from being able to offer amendments to this bill. Yet, I find here I am now restricted not only from being able to present the amendment, but being limited to 5 minutes. Mr. Chairman, before proceeding fur- ther, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York [Ms. V ELA\u00c2ZQUEZ ]. Ms. VEL A\u00c2ZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. I rise today in strong support of this amendment. It would preserve the Fair Housing Initiatives Program [FHIP], an important and cost-effective tool for fighting housing discrimination in our cities, our suburbs, and our rural communities. We'd like to think that discrimina- tion in the real estate market is a thing of the past, or at least a declin- ing problem. The facts show otherwise. For instance, the Federal Reserve has reported that Latino and African- American mortgage applicants in Bos- ton were 60 percent more likely to be turned down for a loan than similar white applicants. In Chicago, 69 percent of white appli- cants with marginal credit histories got a mortgage. Only 16 percent of mi- nority applicants got the loan. HUD reports that Latinos and Afri- can-Americans have at least a 50 per- cent chance of encountering discrimi- nation in housing sales and rentals. The Fair Housing Initiatives Pro- gram is essential for fighting against this persistent discrimination. It re- cruits nonprofit community groups to provide education, outreach, enforce- ment, and counseling regarding our Na- tion's fair housing requirements. Under this program, community groups medi- ate and resolve fair housing disputes; educate and train landlords, real estate agents, and mortgage lenders; and work with families. These are critical activities that the Federal Government simply can not pursue on its own. There's too little staff, and too few resources. Mr. Chairman, I am very well ac- quainted with the good work that's being done under the Fair Housing Ini- tiatives Program. Through this pro- gram, a nonprofit group in my district has discovered and helped combat a persistent pattern of housing discrimi- nation in south Brooklyn. Over the years, hundreds of Latino housing residents had been forced outof their apartment so that they could be made available for white families. Some were harassed, while others were offered cash payments to move. Where these inducements were inad- equate, landlords simply refused to make repairs. Complaints of collapsed ceilings, broken windows, rotted kitch- en cabinets, and leaky pipes were sim- ply ignored. One landlord had compiled up to 84 housing code violations in his effort to displace minority tenants. I am happy to report that after just 6 months, this one grant is having dra- matic results. The inspector general of the city's housing authority has initi- ated a vigorous investigation of dis- criminatory housing practices. Long- overdue repairs are going forward in apartments occupied by non-white ten- ants. This success story is unfolding through one relatively small FHIP grant in New York City. Other suc- cesses are being replayed all across this country. Local advocates and commu- nity groups are being empowered to stamp out discrimination in their local housing markets. FHIP is the kind of initiative that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have always praised. I urge every mem- ber of this body to support this amend- ment. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. The bill would seriously undermine fair housing efforts by virtually aban- doning support for community-based, nonprofit fair housing activities by ze- roing out funding for the Fair Housing Initiatives Program [FHIP]. FHIP is an essential element of a Federal-State- private partnership to combat the seri- ous problem of housing discrimination. Instead, all funds in H.R. 2099 are allo- cated to the Fair Housing Assistance Program [FHAP], also in the Office of Fair Housing. My amendment would di- vide the $30 million allocated in the bill between both programs. FHIP is a competitive grant program that funds nonprofit organizations to enable them to provide education, out- reach, enforcement, and counseling concerning fair housing matters. The activities of FHIP grantees re- duce the caseloads of fair housing cases at HUD, the Department of Justice, and State fair housing agencies by pro- moting voluntary compliance through work with real estate associations, community groups, and advocacy orga- nizations. Through the FHIP program, commu- nity-oriented local fair housing organi- zations supplement the law enforce- ment efforts of the Federal, State, and local governments in an inexpensive and effective manner. Fair housing organizations often work within their communities to me- diate and resolve fair housing disputes informally. In these cases, the dispute is resolved to the satisfaction of the parties, and there is no need to file a formal complaint of discrimination. FHIP agencies provide training and information to landlords, real estateCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7878 July 27, 1995 agents, mortgage lenders, and other members of the real estate industry. These efforts reduce discrimination and help avoid fair housing violations. Fair housing agencies also work with housing consumers to inform them of their rights and to help them resolve fair housing disputes. Through enforce- ment efforts, the agencies weed out nonmeritorious cases and develop the evidence for strong Federal civil rights challenges. FHIP funds testing programs, a criti- cal function in identifying and resolv- ing discrimination practices in housing markets. Testing pinpoints discrimina- tion and gives proof that discrimina- tion occurs. You cannot prosecute if you cannot find discrimination. Test- ing is a precision tool for ferreting out real discrimination. The Fair Housing Assistance Pro- gram [FHAP] has a different mission, and different mode of operation from the FHIP Program. FHAP provides re- imbursement, on a per-case basis, to State and local government agencies that handle legal complaints filed by victims of housing discrimination. Under the Fair Housing Act, HUD has an obligation to accept complaints from people who believe their right to fair housing has been violated. Through the FHAP program, Congress has provided a mechanism for HUD to delegate many of its responsibilities outlined above to State or local gov- ernment agency. Only eight States and five local- fully cer- tified fair housing enforcement agen- cies. These governmental enforcement agencies are generally less than 2 years old. The President requested $15 mil- lion for FHAP in fiscal year 1996, up from $7.4 million as a reflection of con- certed efforts to increase the number of fully certified agencies and to provide technology and training to improve the effectiveness of the agencies. The subcommittee bill provides $30 million\u00d0a four-fold increase over cur- rent year funding. It is unclear how these funds can be spent given the small number of States and localities with certified agencies. FHAP funds cannot be seen as sub- stitutes for FHIP grants. Eliminating FHIP makes the FHAP program far less effective. Not only do the FHIP grants to nonprofits serve a different function, they specifically target areas where the State or local government has not established a fair housing en- forcement agency which would qualify for FHAP funding. Nineteen States do not have substan- tially equivalent certification, and therefore, are not eligible to partici- pate in the FHAP program. The loss of FHIP funding would disproportionately affect the ability of victims of housing discrimination to seek redress in these 19 States. If FHIP were defunded, most fair housing organizations would go out of the fair housing business. Some would go under altogether.There is very little charitable or other financing available for this type of work. Governmental agencies generally do not have the authority to do many of the activities FHIP entities perform. Even where they have the authority, governmental agencies generally have higher operating costs. My amendment would allow both programs of this important office to continue to perform distinct and much- needed functions. I urge you to support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I really had thought that perhaps the chairman of our com- mittee would support this amendment. It does not in any way affect the scor- ing, it does not change the money, ex- cept that it moves half of the $30 mil- lion already appropriated from the FHAP program over to the FHIP pro- gram. This permits these community organizations to continue to do such an excellent job in terms of being able to help negotiate and mediate fair hous- ing discrimination complaints, to the degree that oftentimes lawsuits and time in the courts is avoided by simply being able to mediate these programs in the community. My amendment would allow both programs of this important office to continue to perform distinct, much- needed functions. I would urge my col- leagues to support this amendment. POINT OFORDER The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from New York persist in his point of order? Mr. LAZIO of New York. Mr. Chair- man, I am constrained to make a point of order against the amendment be- cause it proposes to change existing law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, vio- lates clause 2 of rule XXI. The rule states in pertinent part: No amendment to a general appropriation bill shall be in order if changing existing law. This amendment goes to a program whose authorization expired in fiscal year 1994, as was the case of the last amendment. The program is not au- thorized. I ask for a ruling from the Chair. The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. STOKES. Yes, Mr. Chairman. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Ohio is recognized on the point or order. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, the ra- tionale given was that this was not au- thorized. I submit to my colleagues that nothing in HUD was authorized. Everything that is before us today has been protected by way of a special order from the Committee on Rules, but nothing in HUD was authorized. And so, Mr. Chairman, I really do not see any difference in terms of what I am proposing here and that which is contained in the legislation now before this body.The CHAIRMAN. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of order? Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I would like to be heard on the point of order. I think all of us have had a sense that there is supposed to be a new commitment by this House of Representatives to an open process, an open process of an open rule. We had a long debate this morning with the gentleman from New York [Mr. S OLOMON ], chairman of the Com- mittee on Rules, about the fact that this was not an open rule. This amend- ment which the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] offers is an important demonstration of this House's commit- ment to fair lending. There is an enor- mous body of evidence, supported by bank lending, supported by insurance, jobs, and other major indicators, that discrimination is alive and well in America. This amendment goes toward the cures to that, which has been author- ized year in and year out by the au- thorizing committee. What we have seen is an abandonment of the basic re- sponsibilities of the committee. The CHAIRMAN. Would the gen- tleman suspend. The gentleman must speak to the point of order. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I am speaking to the point of order. The CHAIRMAN. The point of order is whether this amendment is author- ized at this time. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I am speaking directly to that. Mr. Chairman, my colleagues might not want to hear the words that I am putting out, but the fact of the matter is, I am dealing directly with this point of order. I am dealing with the Committee on Rules, I am dealing with the Republican attempts to muz- zle. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman is not addressing the point of order. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. To muzzle this rule so that we are dis- allowed from being able to speak on basic discrimination issues, simply be- cause there is no attempt to authorize bills that provide protections against discrimination. This House ought to be ashamed of what is going on before the American people. Shame on this House. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is pre- pared to rule. Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to speak to the point of order. The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman will confine her remarks to the point of order. Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, the point has been made that nothing was authorized. Nothing has been author- ized. We have not had a piece of legisla- tion proposed by the chairman of the subcommittee, by the Republicans, to authorize anything for HUD. If that is the case, Mr. Chairman, if nothing has been authorized, how then is it that we have Members from theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7879 July 27, 1995 other side legislating on the appropria- tion, when, in fact, this side offers amendments and we are told we are not authorized? Would someone please ex- plain this little move, this little trick, this little manipulation that is being used by which they, somehow, let oth- ers have amendments? As I understand it, we have another unauthorized amendment that is going to be put before this committee to- night. Will someone explain please how they get to do it and we do not get to do it? That is really what this discus- sion is all about. Mr. Chairman, people do not mind losing fairly; do not mind being voted down. But to simply have a rule that says some can and some cannot, it is hard for us to accept. So, what I would like to say, somebody needs to explain how it is that the other side can move forward with unauthorized amend- ments and this side cannot. Please ex- plain that. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is pre- pared to rule. For the reasons stated in the Chair's previous ruling, the Chair sustains the point of order. Mr. STOKES. Point of order. The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman from Ohio wish to be heard further on the point of order? Mr. STOKES. Yes, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, there has been a great deal of discussion about the fact that the point of order rules me out of order, be- cause my amendment is not author- ized. I would just like to cite page 103 of the VA\u00b1HUD report and I want to cite the language that appears on that page. It says: Appropriations Not Authorized by law. Pursuant to clause 3 of rule XXI of the House of Representatives, the following lists the appropriations in the accompanying bill which are not authorized by law: Department of Veterans Affairs: Construc- tion; Major Projects; Transitional Housing Loan Program. Department of Housing and Urban Development: All programs. That is the language that appears there. So, Mr. Chairman, it is very dif- ficult to understand how this amend- ment, this important amendment, is ruled out of order by virtue of not being authorized. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair is pre- pared to rule. For the reasons stated in the Chair's prior ruling, the Chair sustains the point of order. The statutory authority cited in the amendment extends only through fiscal year 1994. Absent cita- tion to law extending the authorization through fiscal year 1996, the Chair must sustain the point of order. The fact that other waivers have been granted to other unauthorized appro- priations is not relevant. /ballot1830 AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . HEFLEY Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows:Amendment offered by Mr. H EFLEY : On page 30, line 15 strike ``951,988,000'' and insert ``839,183,000''. The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. EWING ). The gentleman from Colorado [Mr. H EFLEY ] is recognized for 5 min- utes. Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, HUD's fiscal year 1996 budget is being cut by over 25 percent, and we are eliminating 36 individual programs, which I commend, but, amazingly, the appropriation for HUD's administration and management is re- ceiving only a 1 percent cut. We are cutting the substance, but we are keep- ing the bureaucracy, and to me this makes no sense. How can we justify this to the American taxpayer? My amendment simply asks that HUD's administrative portion of its budget take the same cuts as every- thing else in the budget, 25 percent. The Secretary has suggested a plan to reduce HUD's administrative staff from 11,000 to 7,500 employees by the year 2000. But, Mr. Chairman, that is 2 years and 7,500 employees too late. HUD's budget has grown by 400 percent over the last 15 years. Its bureaucracy is in lockstep with that figure. We finally are in a position to elimi- nate the cornerstone of the welfare state. Throughout the year's appro- priation process, amendments to cut further funding from such things as the NEA, CPB, and ICC have been defeated. Members have argued they should not be crippled further. The argument does not hold in this case, because there is no definite plan to abolish this department. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Hefley amendment. The VA\u00b1HUD appropriations bill con- tains $952 million in funding for HUD's management and administration. Now, that is $6 million below the 1995 en- acted level. The Hefley amendment would further reduce funding for HUD's management and administration by $113 million down to $839 million. This additional cut is totally reckless. HUD has prepared an ambitious but prudent plan to downsize the staff by fiscal year 2000 to 7,500 FTE's. Substan- tial progress has already been made to set the agency on a responsible glide path toward this target. HUD is al- ready below the 1995 budget level of 11,918 FTE's\u00d01995 FTE's will be below 11,400, and onboard staff will likely be below 11,000 by September 30. HUD will enter 1996 at a rate over 700 below the 1996 request. Its policies will continue to have reductions through- out the year. The subcommittee mark itself will force a reduction in FTE's to about10,500. The amendment, Mr. Chairman, will require an additional reduction of staff of over 1,800 FTE's. This exces- sive, unwarranted cut would certainly be costly. It would require, without a doubt, a reduction in force of current employees, and the cost of a RIF is substantial. It includes severance pay, unemployment compensation, contin- ued health benefits, and accrued leave payment. It would also lead to tremendous in- stability and inefficiency in the re- maining work force. I would hope the Members would vote against the Hefley amendment. I object to it. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. R OYCE ]. Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to reduce spending for administrative functions in the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and let me share with you that it is only logical that a smaller department with fewer pro- grams needs less money to keep going. We are shortly to vote on a bill which will reduce HUD's overall budget. We are terminating 36 individual HUD pro- grams. Yet as written, this bill cuts the HUD's administrative and manage- ment budget by only a paltry 1 percent, and that makes no sense. If HUD has less to do, as it will, it can do it with less of the American tax- payers' hard-earned resources. The amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. H EFLEY ] calls for a streamlined HUD bureaucracy to man- age its remaining programs. It reduces spending for administrative functions by 25 percent. This amendment does nothing to cripple FHA or GNMA or other con- tinuing HUD programs. But fewer, trimmed-down programs can be run by fewer bureaucrats and should be run by fewer bureaucrats, and I think that is simple arithmetic. Mr. Chairman we cannot implement this year's budget resolution which put us on a glide path toward a balanced budget in 2002 if we do not cut spend- ing. We cannot cut spending significantly unless we recognize that a government that does less needs fewer people to do it. Bloated bureaucracy is not the only reason for bloated government, but it is certainly part of the problem. We are cutting HUD program spending, so let us cut administrative and management budget to match those cuts. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Min- nesota [Mr. V ENTO ]. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. I think the attraction for streamlin- ing and reducing bureaucracy obvi- ously has a certain ring to it that all of us be tempted to join in the chorus. But I would caution the Members thatCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7880 July 27, 1995 simply reviewing the budget in terms of reduced dollars, in terms of pro- grams, does not necessarily translate into reduced responsibilities for a de- partment like HUD. I would remind my colleagues they are completely responsible, for in- stance, for administration of the FHA program, for programs like my col- league on the Committee on Banking and Financial Services should be aware of, of the Real Estate Sales Practices Act. They are responsible for a signifi- cant amount of oversight responsibil- ities that deal with important pro- grams that serve the private sector in terms of housing as well as the second- ary regulatory role and in many other areas. So, simply cutting out the expertise here, the administrative capacity is wrong if there is anything that has been demonstrated, incidentally, it is that where we do have failed public housing authorities, as have recently been taken over in Chicago, they are relying upon HUD today to fill that gap. Fortunately, most housing au- thorities function pretty well, but when they don't the role falls to the Federal HUD. But the oversight responsibilities for 4.7 million units of public housing is substantial for HUD and must not re- duce there capacity without a change in responsibilities. Vote no on the amendment Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Min- nesota [Mr. G UTKNECHT ]. Mr. GUTKNECHT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, with a minute I can- not say much. I do want to share a few facts about how much this department has grown over the last number of years. Since 1980, we have gone from 54 pro- grams to over 200 programs. HUD fund- ing has increased from $12.7 billion in 1980 to $31 billion last year. It is one of the fastest growing departments in the Federal Government. I think the time has come to begin to downsize this department. Jack Kemp, the former Secretary of HUD, has agreed that maybe it is time to get rid of the Department of Housing and Urban Development altogether. Mr. Chairman, I think that eliminat- ing some of these programs is a good first step. But I think if we are going to eliminate administrative overhead here in the House, and the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. L UTHER ] and I re- cently introduced a bill to reduce some of the overhead at the White House, I think it is reasonable to eliminate some of the overhead at the Depart- ment of Housing and Urban Develop- ment. I think it is a good amendment. I hope Members will join me in support- ing it. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I can say categori- cally that this is a matter upon whichwe have not had any hearings whatso- ever in terms of the VA\u00b1HUD Sub- committee. The gentleman from Colo- rado [Mr. H EFLEY ] is not a member of that subcommittee, and we have not had the benefit of anything other than the plan which we know is in effect where the Secretary is attempting to downsize the program in a reasonable, logical way. The plan, to us, makes a lot of sense. We think that this meat ax approach, being taken through this amendment, is wrong to Federal employees, the per- sons who are loyal to this country and to the Government and to the agency they work for. This is abuse of the worst kind. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STOKES. I yield to the gen- tleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I just would like to point out to the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. H EFLEY ] that there was already been a reduc- tion of over 2,000 employees at HUD over the course of the last 2 years. There is a commitment and plan filed to reduce the number of employees down to 7,500, a reduction in force of 6,500 people. I think that, again, this is the prob- lem with the appropriators getting in- volved in dealing with authorization is- sues. We have got to have somebody who has some understanding of what is going on at HUD before people come in here willy-nilly throwing amendments around when they do not know what the heck is actually going on at the agency. There are vast reductions tak- ing place. We are getting this depart- ment under control from the kinds of abuse that took place when the Repub- licans ran HUD and ran the thing into the ground. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, reclaim- ing my time, I yield to the distin- guished chairman of the VA\u00b1HUD Sub- committee. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I appreciate my colleague yield- ing this time to me. I frankly would just like to say, as an aside to my colleague from Massachu- setts, I have learned a lot from the gen- tleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] over the years. I would suggest there is an appropriator who knows a lot about HUD. I am just trying to learn the process. But I think he is pretty good. As a matter of fact, I agree with him on this amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] has expired. Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. B ROWNBACK ]. Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. I rise in strong support of the Hefley amendment. I would just like to make a couple of comments in closing of this debate.Jack Kemp, the former Secretary of HUD, who I do not think anybody would say is any sort of slackard on trying to take care of people in these particular situations and empower peo- ple rather than using bureaucracy, has called for elimination of HUD not be- cause good people do not work at HUD. Good people do work at HUD. It is a fairly centralized planning model. Secretary Cisneros, a very talented gentleman running HUD currently, is making the fourth attempt to reinvent HUD's bureaucracy. This is the fourth time since 1965 that they are trying to reinvent the HUD bureaucracy. I think it is just time to say we have been there, done that, tried that. We need to send a clear message to the bu- reaucracy. The centralized manage- ment system does not work. We need to give power to the people. Send this message through by cutting back on the funding to HUD, the bureaucracy, not the programs, and that is why I think the Hefley amendment is an im- portant step in sending that important signal of change forward. Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds, the remainder of my time. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that is endorsed by the Council on Citi- zens Against Government Waste. What we are talking about is just cutting approximately $113 million from the administrative accounts of HUD to correspond with the 25 percent we cut on the program side of HUD. Now, what I would like to see us do is put HUD on a glide path to extinction. I would like this to be one of the de- partments that we do away with down the line. I think by cutting it 25 percent on both sides this time, in 4 years, if we follow that path, we will be out of busi- ness. I urge support of the amendment. The CHAIRMAN. All time has ex- pired. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I realize my time has expired, but at the time that my time expired, I was in the process of attempting to yield 1 minute to the distinguished chairman of the VA\u00b1HUD Subcommittee. I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], the chairman of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Independent Agencies, be given 1 minute to speak on this issue. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Ohio? There was no objection. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I appreciate the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], but also the gen- tleman from Colorado [Mr. H EFLEY ] for not objecting. I think the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. H EFLEY ] knows that I must unfortunately rise to op- pose this amendment largely because we have made a very, very significant cut in HUD, almost 25 percent. We have pushed them to the wall.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7881 July 27, 1995 This probably takes us to RIF's, and the data before us would indicate that the RIF cost may run as high as $47,000 a year per person. We are not sure we would raise any money. Our objective is to try to be as sen- sitive as we can from this point for- ward. I understand where the gentleman is coming from. I would hope he would continue to support the rest of our ef- forts to cut back government. We have gone a long way with HUD already. I would resist and urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Colorado [Mr. H EFLEY ]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. HEFLEY. Mr. Chairman, I de- mand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. HEFLEY ] will be postponed. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I am doing this for a very brief colloquy with my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. SMITH], whom I promised we would have this an hour ago. He has been very patient. I appreciate it. Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LEWIS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. SMITH of Michigan. Mr. Chair- man, in 1993, my amendment was passed on the floor of this House that encouraged greater cooperation be- tween NASA and USDA. The amendment directed NASA and the Department of Agriculture to work together to make better use of NASA's remote-sensing data for agriculture. Our space program has resulted in de- velopment of remote technology that could greatly improve agriculture. Using remote sensing, we will be better able to, one, anticipate potential food, feed, and fiber shortages or gluts; two, predict impending famines and forest infestations and try to prevent or miti- gate them; three, provide information on condition of crops and croplands; four, assist farmers in the application of pesticides, nutrients, water to maxi- mize crop yields and protect the envi- ronment; and, five, to provide farmers with better information to decide what kind of crops to plant to meet market demands. /ballot1845 The amendment supporting that ef- fort was part of the NASA authorizing bill in both 1993 and 1994 and had the support of the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. B ROWN ] and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. W ALKER ] of the Committee on Science, as well as the gentleman from Texas [Mr. DE LA GARZA ] and the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. R OBERTS ] of the Committee on Ag- riculture.As we reduce funding for agricultural programs by $13 billion and move to- wards a free market, it makes sense to use all available information and tech- nologies for farmers and ranchers. Mr. Chairman, I applaud the effort of the Committee on Appropriations in the report language on commercial technology programs. This program makes available dollars for allowing NASA-developed technologies for com- mercial use. I hope in some small way that we can also allow American agri- culture to expand exports to world markets by assuring that American farmers and ranchers have the informa- tion available through NASA tech- nology to predict supply and demand more accurately, and we are more able to do that, and I compliment the tech- nology we have achieved, and I am hop- ing that the chair of the subcommittee supports that effort. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I certainly do, and I appreciate my colleague bringing for- ward this because it is my intention to see that we make extra effort to tap every resource that is available through the work of NASA. This in- cludes the research that is taking place both in areas like the space station, but also work in other NASA programs. I appreciate the gentleman from Michi- gan [Mr. S MITH] working on this par- ticular issue to assure greater utiliza- tion of available remote-sensing infor- mation to be used by the agricultural industry of this country and to insure an adequate and wholesome supply of food and fiber for our citizens. I and others are interested in making NASA- based technologies available to farmers and ranchers to provide timely infor- mation on crop conditions, projected food, feed, and fiber production, and on any other available information. I would like to tell my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. S MITH], that I agree and encourage the admin- istration of NASA to increase its ef- fort, and will bring this issue up in a conference committee to include in the report language specifically addressing the issue that the gentleman brought up today. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . STOKES Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. S TOKES : Amendment No. 65: Page 41, strike line 1 through ``(2)'' on line 5. Page 45, strike line 22 through page 46, line 7. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] will be recog- nized for 5 minutes, and the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] will be rec- ognized for 5 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.Mr. Chairman, this amendment will strike legislation that delays public housing development funds and the is- suance of incremental rental assist- ance. This bill includes two different proposals that delay programs of criti- cal importance to low-income individ- uals and families, and to the public housing authorities and landlords that serve them. These programs are public housing development funds and incre- mental rental assistance. As it relates to public housing development funds, H.R. 2099 includes a provision that would slow the rate at which a housing authority develops a project in order to slow the overall rate at which develop- ment funds are outlaid. This burden- some provision is an inept attempt to assist HUD in staying within a newly imposed cap included in this bill for the annual contributions to assisted- housing account. Mr. Chairman, what the committee has done is to include language in the bill which imposes a spending limita- tion on assisted housing. This language was added, according to the sub- committee, in order to check the growth in this account. The Department is going to have a hard-enough time trying to adjust to and live within this limitation. It does not need the Congress telling it how best to do this. Year after year, HUD has battled to meet the development needs that accrue at a rate of about $2 billion annually. An estimated $20 bil- lion is needed presently to eliminate this backlog. This certainly is not an area where a delay in obligation is needed. All this delay would do is to skyrocket the backlog even further. The 1-year delay on the issuance of vouchers and certifi- cates effectively eliminates assistance for 1 year, causing great harm just as worst-case housing needs are growing and supplies of decent, affordable hous- ing is shrinking. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I regret to say that I rise to oppose the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. STOKES ]. He and I discussed our own frustration with what has been going on with HUD accounts across the board. We have spent a lot more money year in, year out, over the years, and yet it seems in many instances the money that we are spending has not really gotten to those people that we want to serve the most. I am particularly concerned about the accounts that the amendment of- fered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. STOKES ] addresses in this case, for we are talking about assisted housing. In this bill assisted housing has $19,939,000,000. We have put a cap on that spending amount and are saying to HUD, ``You'll stay within that limi- tation because this is the account thatCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7882 July 27, 1995 has grown way beyond inflation over the years.'' As we have discussed many times today, HUD spending has increased by 50 percent over the last 4 years. In as- sisted housing, at its current rate and pattern of growth, by roughly the year 2000, this account will have grown to roughly $30 billion. If that is the case, it will eliminate other programs that have worked very well. It literally will sequeeze out CDBG, homeless assist- ance, grant programs like public hous- ing operating subsidies, and the HOME program. We have to get HUD to do more than talk about getting control over their own agency. This cap is designed to force them to have very tough account- ing, make sure they know what is going on in this program during the next year. If we do not do that, then all these programs are going to suffer. It is for that reason, Mr. Chairman, in an attempt to get some control over excessive spending and unacceptable growth rates, that we want to have the caps remain. So I oppose the amend- ment offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. G ONZALEZ ]. Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, of course I rise in strong support of my colleague's amendment. These two pro- visions would strike, make no policy sense. They have no budgetary impact, too, that he addresses. At their worst they represent an effort to thwart any kind of expansion, even the most mini- mal, in public or section 8 housing in fiscal year 1996 when those of us that get around, not only in our district but throughout the State and the country and meet in those areas of the greatest need in our country, know what the pressing need continues to be. It gives us a devastating feeling. In other words, I want to again com- mend my colleague's leadership as he has through the years given us on the level of the Committee on Appropria- tions. Even when we had more suitable and propitious environments as far as what we thought the votes would be, our problems were perennial and con- tinue to be as far as appropriations are concerned, and despite his preeminent position as chairman, and even going against an overwhelming majority of his colleagues on the committee, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] has always been in favor of what we have diligently had hearings and concluded from those hearings throughout the country and in Washington are the cry- ing desperate needs of a large segment of our population. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would like to go back for a moment to address just the latter part of my previous argument. Before doing so, however, the chairman of the committee did state that he andI have on occasions discussed HUD and some of its problems, and indeed we have, and I think that we have both discussed those problems from a van- tage point of wanting to help HUD be able to solve the various problems that confront this very important agency. It is just that on this particular issue, again, philosophically we disagree on the approach. I am concerned, very much concerned, about the micromanagement from Congress in terms of this cap. But in terms of the 1-year delay, Mr. Chairman, let me also say that this delay, even for 1 year, would mean no new incremental assistance would be made available to address national needs including demolition, relocation, litigation, and demixing of elderly and disabled populations. Both of these pro- visions are budget-neutral and have been added only as another attempt to micromanage HUD. By striking these provisions, we would remove two very cumbersome provisions and be able to keep in place all of the committee's funding recommendations. Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield to me briefly? Mr. STOKES. I yield to the gen- tleman from Texas. Mr. GONZALEZ. In connection with that what he was just saying: In other words, if this amendment fails, there will be no new public hous- ing, nor section 8 housing, and the more than 11\u00a42million families on the waiting lists now will continue to wait and wait and wait, and perhaps into many years in the foreseeable future because remember, distinguished com- rade, affordable housing is decreasing, it is not increasing. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gen- tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. R OTH]. Mr. ROTH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California [Mr. LEWIS] for yielding this time to me. I think caps in this case are appropriate. Let me tell my colleagues why I say that: Last year there was a big article in the Wall Street Journal, many of the other newspapers around the country, about Federal investigators from HUD who were going around the country il- legally frightening people, saying that if someone demonstrates, they do not want a certain project in their commu- nity, why there is a $50,000-a-day fine, 1 year in prison. I remember all kinds of stories circulating in the national press. Now, the critics of these intimidating investigations point out that such Gov- ernment action is encroaching on the constitutional guarantees of free speech, assembly, right to protection against Government policies, decisions, and actions, and the critics say all neighborhood political activity, includ- ing filing lawsuits, should be declared safe from Government penalty. In oth- ers words, there were 34 cases of thesewhere HUD was going around intimi- dating people, groups, and even the Civil Liberties Union came on and said to protest at the HUD and to Secretary Cisneros because of the HUD free- speech abuses surfacing in all the na- tional press. This is an outrageous example of an agency run amok when they are so egregious in their violations that even the Civil Liberties Union is saying that this action cannot be tolerated of an agency. I think it is going too far, and I think that is why the caps are impor- tant. /ballot1900 Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I probably will not use those 2 minutes. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the point that the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. R OTH] has made. There have been serious problems raised about the man- agement of HUD and the funds that flow from HUD in local communities; Washington, DC, is one, Baltimore is another. There are a number of others. We do need to carefully review what we have done in the past so that we can correct some of the difficulties in the future. I appreciate my colleague from Wisconsin raising the point, for it is an important consideration. Mr. Chairman, I would like to men- tion in closing that 2 weeks ago an As- sistant Secretary at HUD was quoted in a Washington Post editorial as say- ing that funding in the account that we are dealing with here could consume the Department entirely if nothing is done to curb spending there. That editorial and quotation essen- tially made my point here. Assisted housing is important, but it has been growing. It is at $19 billion, almost $20 billion now; it will be at least $30 bil- lion by the end of this century. This cap is designed to assist and help HUD, and perhaps, to put their house in order. Mr. Chairman, I urge a no vote on this amendment. The CHAIRMAN. All time has ex- pired. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. The question was taken; and the chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I de- mand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. STOKES ] will be postponed. Are there other amendments to title II? AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . VENTO Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. V ENTO :CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7883 July 27, 1995 AMENDMENT NO. 69: Page 28, line 3, after the dollar amount insert the following ``(in- creased by $184,000,000)''. Page 64, line 16, before the last comma in- sert ``(reduced by $235,000,000)''. Page 66, line 15, after the dollar amount in- sert the following ``(increased by $30,000,000)''. The CHAIRMAN. Under previous agreement, the gentleman from Min- nesota [Mr. V ENTO ] will be recognized for 20 minutes and the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] will be recog- nized for 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. V ENTO ]. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. Chairman, this amendment re- stores full funding to the Federal Emergency Management Agency's emergency food and shelter program, a program for the homeless. This is an amendment to try and restore the moneys to at least the 1995 level as far as we can within the authorization of the limits of this bill. It further re- stores $184 million to fully fund as near as we can, again, to the HUD McKinney Homeless Assistance programs. Mr. Chairman, these programs and dollars are desperately needed, and I am pleased to have the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], the ranking mem- ber of the committee, and the gen- tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K EN- NEDY ] join me in offering this amend- ment. I know I have the strong support too of the gentleman from Texas [Mr. GONZALEZ ], the ranking member of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services. Mr. Chairman, these are important programs that deal with the poorest of the poor. The fact is that we are taking these dollars out of the FEMA ac- counts. We have just put $6.5 billion into the FEMA accounts. They have significant amounts of dollars that are unobligated in those accounts. This bill restores or adds an extra $320 million. What we are concerned about, Mr. Chairman, is dealing with the disaster that is occurring right now, today, on the streets of this Nation, rather than those that might occur in the future. As the Chairman knows, we have seri- ous problems, serious types of issues that occur, whether it has been the west coast or the Midwest or in other parts of this Nation, and in Florida. We have responded with significant amounts of help in terms of disaster as- sistance. Those accounts have signifi- cant amounts of unobligated balances. We know, Mr. Chairman, that if we reduce the funds for these McKinny programs, for these FEMA homeless programs, and I might say work with the nonprofits, work with the private sector, work with our State and local governments we will be dealing with serious problems that we have with re- gards to people without shelter. In fact, the population of this number of people is excess of 600,000 persons. Mr. Chairman, I do not know per- fectly what the problem is with regard to this, why we have this problem, butI do know that our nonprofits, for in- stance, that work with the board of charities, the United Way of America, the Salvation Army, the National Council of Churches of Christ, the American Red Cross, these nonprofits are working on overload. This should be a program that I think all of us should reach out to embrace to try and help the nonprofits, to help these local communities that are striving to meet the needs of the homeless; those fami- lies that find themselves, for whatever reason, out on the street. Mr. Chairman, these programs are working. The program has stood true to its original mandate. It has grown because the nature of our society and the problems of the affordability of housing and the social disruption that has occurred in this Nation for a vari- ety of reasons have persisted. Mr. Chairman, over the years, several millions of people have been provided assistance. It is not a stable popu- lation, it is a population that we are addressing, but they continue to grow. We have almost 2,500 local boards, Mr. Chairman, that need this money. We should not cut them off. They will not have the resources if we do not provide it and we should vote for the Vento- Kennedy-Stokes amendment. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk. This amendment will restore $30 million in funding to the Federal Emergency Manage- ment Agency's Emergency Food and Shelter program to the level of fiscal year 1995 and would provide an additional $184 million to the HUD McKinney Homeless Assistance pro- grams. Under my amendment, offered with Mr. STOKESand Mr. K ENNEDYof Massachusetts, these funds would be transferred from the FEMA disaster assistance program. In many respects, I am advocating transfer- ring funds from a natural disaster fund for the future to provide funds for two man-made dis- aster funds that have a dire need for dollars today. At the very least, some 600,000 Ameri- cans, individuals, adults and children, are homeless every day. Millions have experi- enced homelessness and unfortunately, mil- lions more teeter on the verge of homeless- ness. The FEMA Emergency Food and Shelter program has been a program for over a dec- ade. It is a unique program within the Federal Government that in fact is partnered at the na- tional and local levels with boards comprised of the major charities: the United Way of America, the Salvation Army, the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, Catholic Charities USA, the Council of Jewish Federations, Inc., and the American Red Cross. These partners are the non-profits that, prior to Federal recognition in the late 1980's of the homeless problems faced by this coun- try, were there responding to homelessness in our cities and towns. They are still there and they are on overload. The program has stood true to its original mandate: to supplement and expand efforts to provide shelter, food and supportive services to homeless, individuals, and to strengthen ef- forts to create more effective and innovative local programs. Over the years, it has served millions of people by providing or linking themto appropriate services and by preventing fam- ilies or individuals from becoming homeless. Last year, $128.4 million was allocated to 2,489 local boards through 11,010 local recipi- ent organizations. That funding represents over 100 million meals; over 4 million nights in shelter; over 663,000 instances of rent or mortgage assistance to keep someone in their home; and over 214,000 instances of utilities assistance. That phenomenal assistance would be cut by 23 percent in the next fiscal year without this Vento amendment to restore the funds. That 23 percent cut would result in almost 24 million less meals, close to one million fewer nights of shelter for individuals or fami- lies with children, over 150,000 less instances of homelessness prevention through rent or mortgage assistance, and almost 50,000 fewer similar prevention opportunities through utili- ties payments assistance. In my own district, Ramsey County would receive $35,156 fewer dollars. Dollars that could help provide over 12,000 meals, 564 nights in shelter, 37 rent or mortgage assist- ance payments, and 23 utilities payments in this upcoming year. In restoring the $184 million to the HUD homeless programs, we will reverse the course taken by the Appropriations Committee that could result in approximately 130,000 few Americans being served by the HUD home- less assistance programs in the next fiscal year. That could literally mean an additional 130,000 more Americans abandoned to life on our streets, under our bridges or in our parks instead of being brought back into their com- munities as productive citizens. During the Clinton administration, the home- less programs at HUD have begun to work to- gether in a comprehensive fashion at the na- tional and community levels. They have recog- nized that the problems of homelessness are not just associated with a lack of housing and have appropriately sought our support serv- ices to pair with transitional programs. HUD has also recognized that prevention is the key\u00d0and that can mean jobs and job skills, education opportunities, temporary mortgage assistance or substance abuse treatment. HUD has asked our Nation's communities to responsibly identify the needs of their home- less or near homeless communities and to craft comprehensive plans to address those needs. These $184 million in funds I would re- store today are critical to continuing that effort. The numbers of people served by these programs whose funds I would restore cannot be ignored by this Congress. In fact, they rep- resent the fortunate folks who receive assist- ance and that are given the opportunity to turn their lives around\u00d0either before or after a homeless experience. The many bills being considered by this Congress now, including the appropriations bills and other so-called re- form efforts, will without question increase the number of homeless Americans. The appro- priations bill alone slashes our housing budget that assists so many of the poorest of the poor\u00d0practically a formula for increasing homelessness across the country. Mr. Chairman, I urge the Members to sup- port this amendment. Put in context, restoring these funds will put one small piece of the puzzle back for those organizations that serve individuals and families in need. These pro- grams and the organizations in community after community are facing reduced funds thatCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7884 July 27, 1995 will result in reduced quality and quantity of services. Unfortunately, they are not facing re- duced demand. I ask my colleagues to sup- port this amendment and reserve the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise to oppose the Vento amendment. The amendment of the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. V ENTO ] is de- signed to provide assistance where we are currently providing assistance. He would add $184 million to homeless as- sistance grants and $30 million to FEMA's emergency food and shelter grants. The latter was only a $130 mil- lion account in the first place. We cut $30 million out of it. We believe it is a good program. Mr. Chairman, in terms of the home- less assistance grants, I think it should be said that there was a $297 million deferral that came through the rescis- sion process. It would be applied to the amount that is appropriated in this bill. So we have attempted to use that, combined with the appropriated amount, to make this account whole, relative to the 1995 year. Mr. Chairman, the fact is that while these are difficult times, we are con- cerned about the homeless assistance grants. We wanted to make sure that there was funding to allow them to go forward with the programs in place, still hoping that those programs would be much more effective for the home- less than they had been thus far. Mr. Chairman, having said that, the amendment of the gentleman from Minnesota takes the money from all of FEMA's emergency assistance. I mean literally, he zeroes those accounts. The import that that will have on people who are homeless for other reasons is very real. That is not the account to take it from. Mr. Chairman, I would urge the gen- tleman to recognize that we have at- tempted very seriously to balance these accounts carefully. To zero the FEMA accounts in the face of some of those problems that we know exist would be a very big mistake for the House. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment of the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO ]. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve the balance of my time. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. G ONZALEZ ]. Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to ask the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] a question. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will yield, I will be glad to respond. Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to confirm, are not $297 million that you were speaking of, are not they already obligated? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, no, they are not.Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, they are not? Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GONZALEZ. I yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. If the gentleman will yield to me, I would suggest that that is correct, that those dollars have al- ready been appropriated. The chairman suggests that somehow releasing and not obligating them and counting them for next year would in fact make these programs whole, that this program will be substantially below what it was last year, even with the dollars I am restor- ing. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will yield, the $297 million was a part of the rescission package which was not signed into law until today. We have awarded most of this money. They had not been obli- gated because obviously most of the money had not been available prior to the signing of the rescission bill. This funding does flow into next year, it supplements the program, and I think it makes it whole. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, it is not all that we would like to do, but we are operating with a limited pool of re- sources. The gentleman and I know very well, if the gentleman looks at Oklahoma City and other places, what zeroing FEMA might mean. So this is taking money from the wrong place when we have tried in very difficult circumstances to make adjustments that at least cause us to get through this year in a reasonable way in these accounts. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. GONZALEZ. I yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. I thank the gentleman for yielding. Mr. Chairman, I would just point out, we cannot count it twice. It will be ob- ligated in this fiscal year. It takes time with the grant and application process to, in fact, process this. The gentleman says it is a disaster only if it is big enough. But if some- body is out of their home, it is a disas- ter for that individual. The point is that the FEMA money we are putting in here and the homeless money can be directly used in that way. We are sug- gesting that we avoid not just the nat- ural disasters, but some of the man- made disasters that occur with regard to people being homeless. Mr. STOKES. I thank the distin- guished gentleman for yielding time to me, and I rise in support of the Vento- Kennedy-Stokes amendment. Mr. Chairman, all of us are privileged to live in the greatest country in the world. I think all of us are proud to live here. But I think one thing that must hurt or pain any American is to walk through the streets, as I have walked through my city in Cleveland and other cities throughout the coun- try, and see people on grates, lying in doorways.I recall just a few years ago when the homeless problem began to gain great- er attention, we used to see a single in- dividual in a doorway, a single individ- ual on a grate, lying on a lawn. Now we see whole families. We see mothers, fa- thers, and children. Many of them were hard-working people. Many of them are dislocated workers and others who, by one reason or another, have come upon some very hard luck. In many cases, there are mental problems involved. At any rate, it is something that certainly ought to pain every American, and in America, the richest country in the world, there ought not be any homeless people. Mr. Chairman, this bill devastates our Nation's efforts to prevent home- lessness. It guts the McKinney Home- less Assistance Grants Program through a massive 40-percent reduc- tion. Homelessness is a devastating ex- perience to families, to parents, and children alike. Homelessness disrupts virtually every aspect of life, damaging the physical and emotional health of family members, interfering with the education of children and the develop- ment of children, resulting in the dev- astating separation of family members. Mr. Chairman, the cuts to HUD over- all jeopardize an already fragile afford- able housing situation in this Nation. Just this week reports about the dis- turbing growing affordable housing shortage in the United States has been released. Now we want to add further instability to poor people's lives by slashing homeless assistance grants. Mr. Chairman, I would strongly urge my colleagues to support the Vento amendment. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. G ON- ZALEZ ]. Mr. GONZALEZ. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. V ENTO ] for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I served as a chairman of this Subcommittee on Housing for a few years and took advantage of that to travel from one end of the country to the other, from California to New York, and from the Canadian border to the Mexican border. We visited the slums and we visited the better neigh- borhoods in our country. Mr. Chairman, I will never forget, not only here in the District where I witnessed a man frozen to death on the streets downtown, a homeless man one cold night, and in New York we had several occurrences of that kind. So we went out and had hearings and a result of those hearings, we forged the present constellation, so to speak, of laws that target this kind of problem. Those were the first hearings we had on that matter, and as I said, they were comprehensive, and we tried to go from the rural and the remote to the most urban and dense.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7885 July 27, 1995 Mr. Chairman, homelessness is not just about housing, but about support- ive services as well. HUD once called it a continuum of care, which I thought was, as fancy as it seems, a very appro- priate phrase. They recently an- nounced $900 million in grants for this year, more than 800 projects across the country. Unless this amendment passes, these funds will be cut by more than one-third. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support re- storing funds to the FEMA emergency food and shelter program. In my home State, this program has been invalu- able. If the funds are not restored in Texas, nearly 1.5 million fewer meals would be served, nearly 66,000 nights in shelters would be lost, nearly 3,400 fam- ilies would not receive assistance. /ballot1915 Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I Yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. W ATT], a member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Commu- nity Opportunity of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services. Mr. WATT of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I have been sitting here and listening to this debate on the housing part of this bill for the last 2 to 3 hours, and getting more and more distressed, and, to be honest, very sad- dened by what we are engaged in. There is not a person in this body who does not own a home. Most of us own two homes. We have a home here in Washington and a home in our home districts. I am told that some of us have three, and four homes. In addition to our Washington home and our dis- trict home, we have a mountain home and a beach home, and all of us get a tax subsidy for the interest that we pay on those homes. Notwithstanding that, we are here depriving people, the most vulnerable people, of a place to live. Well, I cannot understand what we are doing. I do not understand what it is we are trying to achieve. How can we expect to improve our Nation and the things that our Nation stands for when a significant number of our citizens do not have access to any housing, much less one, two, three or four homes? How can we expect to achieve our destiny as a nation when many of our people are living on the streets? We have got Members of Congress who are sleeping in the buildings here, even though they can afford homes. We do not let homeless people come into our buildings and sleep here, but our Mem- bers can get that tax free. And we take advantage of it. So what are we doing here? We are passing a bill that cuts $400 million from public housing operations. That means that the housing authorities in my district, which are barely function- ing now, cannot do an adequate job of maintaining and preventing deteriora- tion of the housing stock that we own as the American people. We are cutting $1.2 billion in mod- ernization funds so that people con-tinue to live in these rotting, terrible housing conditions, in a nation that is prospering. We are cutting the drug elimination program, wiping it completely off the books, at the time when drugs are spreading, and they are particularly spreading in public housing and around lower income neighborhoods. These are the funds that our housing authorities, those in my congressional district, have used to try to beef up se- curity and do some drug training with the young people in the neighborhood to keep them out of drugs and get the police to come in and do joint efforts with them, to try to attack this dev- astating problem. And we are cutting out the money for the homeless people, the most vulnerable people in America. I want to urge my colleagues, please consider what we are doing and vote against this bill and in favor of the Vento amendment. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from North Carolina [Mrs. C LAYTON ]. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of re- storing funds to the McKinney home- less programs. We are facing such ex- treme cuts in housing programs in this bill. This is really a mean-hearted bill. It is a callous disregard for the pain that people are suffering. Further, we are cutting out approxi- mately 40 percent from the homeless program itself, a program that effec- tively serves rural communities such as mine, the poorest of the poor, and those Americans who are most depend- ent on these to help them. In fact, given the discussion we have had on the point of order, this whole bill may not ever be spent, not one dol- lar may be spent on housing because of the clauses in the appropriation. It says all of these housing expenditures are subject to the authorization. In any event, we should know that we are doing wrong. On any given night, at any given time, at any back alley of any city in this country, or on any crowded street, or on any gutter, we can find more than 700,000 Americans who sleep there and make that their home. There is no shame in being homeless. Those people you see have no shame. The shame is with us, with us as a soci- ety, in allowing homelessness to exist in America, an America where we are very prosperous. But there is greater shame in having a solution to home- lessness and failing to respond. We know what we must do, and we are fail- ing to do it. Homeless programs are working well. They are working well in North Caro- lina, they are working well in Green- ville, Charlotte, Wilmington, and in Cumberland County, all across this country and other parts of this United States. But we if we fail to pass this amendment, we will fail more than 150,000 to have a place to call their own.Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Mrs. CLAYTON. I yield to the gen- tleman from Minnesota. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I would say they are working so well, and I would remind my colleagues, all of these homeless funds are matching funds. When you cut $100 million, you are cutting $200 million. We are cutting back on the local participation at the same time. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, re- claiming my time, let me just close by stating some have reminded us a care- ful reading of our Bibles will reveal that Mary and Joseph both were home- less. They were faced with a situation that was not their choice, but their fate. So there are those who indeed are down on their luck. It is not by choice, but it is their fate. We should surely be more responsive and responsible. We should never let that happen in Amer- ica. Surely there is money, we can find the money. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I urge us to be responsible and support the Vento amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would like to share with the gentlewoman my own concern about the subject area, because I think she expresses very well what should be the concern of all of us. We have, since I have been in the House, truly seen an explosion in the spending for housing, in programs that proliferate in many forms. Some have worked very well, and some have not worked so well. My concern is this: While housing has increased by 50 percent over the last 4 years, since 1990 homeless fund- ing has tripled. There are some home- less programs that have worked very well; there are many that have not worked at all. You clearly can see across the country, in urban center after urban center, growing numbers of people on grates in the wintertime sleeping in the cold. All of us have to be concerned about that. My consternation is the fact that we have spent so much on housing in gen- eral over the last decade. Yet this prob- lem has come upon us, and we have not found a solution. We are helping some individuals, but the problem seems to grow. That is another reason I feel we need to shake this agency, to rethink the way they are using dollars. I am very concerned about this. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LEWIS of California. I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina. Mrs. CLAYTON. Mr. Chairman, I would inquire of the gentleman if he thought that the problem is with the agency, or there is a problem really with society as well we are facing? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, reclaiming my time, I take theCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7886 July 27, 1995 problem back to those of us who have served in state legislatures who may have made some bad judgments about this whole subject area. People of very good heart years ago in California were concerned about people being institu- tionalized in mental institutions, and we closed those down and suggested that people could go back to their com- munities and receive clinical service. We never kept the promise of clinical service. A high percentage of the people who are in the streets are people who have mental difficulties, people who suffer from various kinds of addiction. We need to rethink those past policies to help HUD do a better job. I, frankly, think that HUD has failed to think the problem through carefully. I empathize with the gentlewoman's concern, and because she was express- ing that concern so well, I wanted to share this exchange. Mrs. CLAYTON. If the gentleman will yield further, I want to thank the gentleman for acknowledging my posi- tion. I would hope my expression of concern would penetrate sufficiently that he indeed would support the amendment that the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. V ENTO ] is presenting. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself one minute. Mr. Chairman, on the point that my friend and colleague from California was making, last term the Speaker ap- pointed me and I chaired a task force. As the gentleman may know, I have been working very long and hard on this particular problem, and have been associated with it since it has been considered by Congress. I would just tell the gentleman that the questions he raised are in that report. They are in the report that Andrew Cuomo led last year. These are good programs. We passed a reauthorization bill to consolidate many of the homeless programs. They are working. They are programs that are dealing with the problem. And it is not something we lay at the feet of any particular administration, it is a social problem. I would say with regards to the men- tal illness issue, a question posed to me by a sociologist in Arizona I think an- swers that question. The question is how long can a person be on the street and maintain their mental well-being and balance? It is a good question. I agree with the gentleman, because I worked in the legislature when we did the programs in terms of deinstitu- tionalization. Minnesota is proud of having had many institutions for those with disabilities. Unfortunately, it has led to a more severe problem in many respects with the SLIC programs. The gentleman is exactly correct about the lack of funding for those programs. Mr.Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas [Ms. JACKSON -LEE], who has been a strong advocate, and, although new to the Congress, has worked hard on this project.Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his outstanding leadership on this issue, and, as well sharing the time for an issue that I think, as I have heard the chairman mention, has to be a bi- partisan issue. I thank the ranking member [Mr. STOKES ] for being persistent on the question of homelessness. I would say to the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO ], that as we are suffering under the heat of the summer, many citizens are about to take their vacation or they have been on their vacation, and they have had the opportunity to enjoy cool weather and warm weather. However, I would say, that homeless Americans face the condition of home- lessness, no matter whether it is cool or hot. They do not have an oppor- tunity to take a vacation. They suffer under whatever the conditions are all year long. Many times they suffer from the intensity of the heat or the vicious- ness of the cold weather. I do not know how many people who are housed will be taking a vacation to homeless encampments, but I have seen those encampments in my city of Houston. I have seen the families, the elderly, the individuals in fact who have worked all their life, and, because of conditions that they find themselves in, they are now homeless. In fact, I would simply say, that I came upon a gentleman who was a vet- eran, who had worked in a steel mill, and he was yet living in a homeless condition because he was not able to access his pension or his benefits, and he remained there for a long period of time. /ballot1930 However, he was able to be helped. But the next person living under torn sheets in the same encampment could not access any benefits, was not suffer- ing from mental illness, in fact had family but had fallen upon hard times because there was no employment. What you find in the community is that people have come together like United Way, like the Coalition for the Homeless and other community groups to fight homelessness. They have, in fact, brought people together and in using the McKinney Act funds have provided housing for the homeless. Why cut these homeless funds by 50 percent, I support the Vento amend- ment, therefore I am withdrawing the Jackson-Lee amendment to join in cre- ating an additional $184 million for homeless assistance and an additional $30 million for FEMA emergency food and shelter program. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gen- tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K EN- NEDY ] who has been a leading advocate of the homeless veterans. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] is recognized for 1 minute. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, homelessness has been cre-ated more by government policy than by any fault of the individuals that find themselves in that condition. We, through the stroke of the pen that will be done by the House of Representa- tives this evening, will create more and more homelessness. The notion that we in this committee today will end up striking 40 percent of the Nation's homeless funds is a fact that every single Member should recog- nize when they vote on the Vento amendment. Cutting the money that sustains homeless shelters, that takes families and our Nation's veterans and gives them a little hope that maybe somebody cares, that maybe their country cares about them enough to bring them off of a cold grate in the middle of winter and put them into a shelter and give them a hot meal, and we are going to be saying, no, we do not care. We are going to be turning away peo- ple at homeless shelters because we do not have the courage to stand up to a tax cut, to stand up against these abu- sive cuts that have taken place to our Nation's homeless and housing pro- grams. Please vote for the Vento amend- ment. Vote against homelessness in America. The CHAIRMAN. The time of the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. V ENTO ] has expired. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield back the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Minnesota [Mr. V ENTO ]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. VENTO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO ] will be postponed. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . KENNEDY OF MASSACHUSETTS Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. K ENNEDY of Massachusetts: Amendment No. 12: Page 46, strike ``(a)'' in line 17 and all that follows through line 23. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement of today, the gentleman from Massachu- setts, [Mr. K ENNEDY ] will be recognized for 20 minutes, and the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] will be recog- nized for 20 minutes. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7887 July 27, 1995 I first of all want to thank and recog- nize the tremendous work that the gen- tlewoman from California, [Ms. W A- TERS ], in particular, has done on this issue. She has been a leader in fighting discrimination in this country throughout her entire political career, and she continues it in the most distin- guished fashion in her work on the Committee on Banking and Financial Services and dealing with our Nation's housing ills. I also want to thank the chairman; well, I wish he was still chairman, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], for the efforts that he has made through- out his career but most particularly on this housing bill. It has not been a very encouraging series of amendments that we have voted on so far today. Never- theless, he continues to persist and we appreciate his efforts. This amendment tries to deal with the harmful and damaging provisions that are contained in this legislation that sabotages the access of minority Americans to ownership of homes in our country by preventing HUD from fighting insurance redlining. This amendment has no cost associated with it. Mr. Chairman, the Speaker of this body often talks about creating an ``open society'' here in America. I wholeheartedly agree with the Speaker in his efforts to achieve this goal, and I share his vision of an America of truly equal opportunity where a person achieves according to merit. But, unfortunately, we do not live in that society. Today we live in a society where you, if you happen to be a person of color, you are 60 percent more likely to be turned down for a home mortgage than a white person coming from the same income, the same neighborhood, and with the same credit history. If you are a person of color, if your home or business is located in a pre- dominantly minority area, you are more likely to be denied insurance or you will be forced to pay more for the insurance without regard to the actual risk associated with the insurance pol- icy. I want to repeat that statement be- cause it is very important. If you live in an area with a high con- centration of minorities, you will pay significantly more for insurance even though losses you suffer are no dif- ferent than losses from similar white neighborhoods. This, my colleagues, is called dis- crimination. And in the area of housing and property insurance, it is HUD's job to investigate to try to resolve and where necessary begin legal action to prevent such discrimination. But if we do not support this amend- ment that is before us now, this dis- crimination will go on unchallenged, uncorrected, and unpunished. Almost everyone in this body has heard of the American Family Insur- ance case. Management literally pun- ished agents for writing too many poli- cies to blacks. But the sad fact isAmerican Family was only the most obvious about doing what most insur- ance companies do. Again, the evidence is clear. The Na- tional Association of Insurance Com- missioners did a study of the availabil- ity and the price of homeowners insur- ance in 25 metropolitan areas in the 13 largest States. The findings were clear: Average premiums are higher, and availability more limited, even when loss costs are taken into the account, in areas of minority concentration. An extensive study put out by the Missouri Insurance Commissioner in May of this year shows: ``low income minority neighborhoods in both Kansas City and St. Louis pay higher pre- miums but incur lower claims than similar white urban areas for all home- owners insurance policies sold.'' Among the 20 largest Missouri home- owner insurers, 5 firms have minority market shares of less than one-twenti- eth of their share of white markets. The impact of this discrimination is clear. Without access to homeowners insurance, people do not have access to homes. Let me quote a recent court de- cision: ``no insurance, no loan; no loan, no house.'' The fact is that the Republican Party has a tremendous tradition of standing up against racial discrimination. It was the Republican Party that gave us Abraham Lincoln. It was the Lincoln Republicans that led the charge to fight against discrimination in Amer- ica. The Republican tradition needs to come back to life. Instead of fighting the ability of HUD to go out and get rid of this cancer of racial discrimination, please support the Kennedy-Waters- Stokes amendment. Fight any attempt for whatever reasons and rationale the Republicans will come up with to end up opposing this amendment, and rec- ognize that discrimination in this country needs to be ferreted out. That is what this amendment will do. It will allow HUD to do its job and allow people to gain stature because of their own individual merit, not because of the color of their skin. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from California [Ms. W ATERS ]. Ms. WATERS. Mr. chairman, I, too, would like to thank the ranking mem- ber of our Subcommittee on Housing and Community Opportunity of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services, the gentleman from Massa- chusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ], for his leader- ship and work that he has done in this area. I would like to thank the ranking member of this subcommittee, of the Committee on Appropriations, for all that he has done over the years in the area of fair housing. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup- port of the Kennedy-Stokes-Waters amendment. This amendment would strike legislation contained in this ap- propriations bill which would have a devastating impact on our effort to fight discrimination.The Fair Housing Act is the law. The courts have ruled that part of HUD's responsibility under the Fair Housing Act involves property insurance. The language in this bill would strictly pro- hibit HUD from implementing this part of its mission. Let's be clear. Legally, HUD's re- sponsibility to enforce fair lending supercedes the Federal Government's general noninvolvement in insurance matters under the McCarren-Ferguson Act. Since the Fair Housing Act was updated in 1988, HUD has investigated, negotiated settlements, and rep- resented complianants in cases of prop- erty insurance discrimination. This amendment would stop HUD in its tracks on this whole range of activi- ties. Without this amendment: Individuals who have been victims of discrimination would be denied their basic rights under the Fair Housing Act. HUD would have to cease its ongoing investigations at the end of the fiscal year. If ongoing settlement negotia- tions stopped, many of their statutes of limitations would expire before new authority for HUD could be reinstated. Administrative hearings for cases un- derway would cease. Recent cases of discrimination could not be investigated by HUD. HUD could not engage in any re- search or educational activities that would clarify solutions to discrimina- tion problems for insurers, consumer and community groups, and State reg- ulators. HUD would be required to stop any voluntary programs, like those they are currently engaged in with the mortgage banking industry. Why would this Congress want to pre- vent one of our primary antidiscrimi- nation agencies from enforcing a civil rights law? Insurance redlining is a problem, Mr. Chairman. HUD has years of experience enforcing the Fair Hous- ing Act. Property insurance compli- ance is part of that law. I am deeply offended that this Appro- priations Committee would, without hearings, without consulting the au- thorizing committee, without any pub- lic discussion\u00d0place a strightjacket on HUD's ability to enforce an important antidiscrimination law. A few weeks ago, the Banking Com- mittee debated a similar rollback of the Fair Housing Act. That discussion was heated, it was emotional, and it was intense. At the end of that discus- sion, after several hours, the Banking Committee resoundingly voted to up- hold the Fair Housing Act. I think it was wrong then to try to take away people's rights without a proper airing of the view; without a proper forum. I think it would be wrong now. I would ask this House to use reason. I would ask that we act with fairness. Do not vote to curtail basic civil rights. Support this amendment. Mr. Chairman, I am surprised that a flier is going around signed by two ofCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7888 July 27, 1995 the Members of this House, the gen- tleman from Michigan [Mr. KNOLLENBERG ] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. E WING ], and they say things such as: Everyone agrees that proper insurance underwriting is based solely on factors of economic risk, not on race, not on sex, not on ethnicity. They deny that there is any redlining. I live in a redlined area. I live in what is known as south central Los An- geles. It is not fiction. It is not imagi- nary. I know that there is redlining and there is discrimination. Before we completed our debate in the committee on fair housing, at one point I asked the chairman of that committee to please provide some lead- ership. I asked the chairman if indeed we were going to sit there at 11 at night and undo fair housing laws in this country without any airing, with- out any hearings, without any author- ization. Let me tell my colleagues something. It was a proud moment because the chairman took over and gave some di- rection. And do my colleagues want to know what? Republican Members of that committee said no, this is not right. /ballot1945 We are not going to do it. It is not fair to sit here and dismantle fair hous- ing and civil rights laws. Guess what? Because of a bipartisan effort, we stopped the madness and we got a grip. We got a handle, and it did not happen. I am going to say this evening, I hope reason will prevail. I am going to ask that some leadership be provided; not let us move into this kind of dis- mantlement of civil laws in this coun- try. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I wanted to mention that there is not any way in this legis- lation that we are undoing the fair housing law. Indeed, the States and the country have to be responsive to that law. This item that is before us does not relate to that body of law. I under- stand the gentlewoman's point, and the gentlewoman and I sometimes know that both of us make our point in ex- cess. Nonetheless, this bill does not re- late to undermining the fair housing law. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. KNOLLENBERG ]. Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, obviously, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment. I know that the gentlewoman from Cali- fornia [Ms. W ATERS ] and the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] favor another idea, but I would ask them to listen to some of the things I want to say. The gentlewoman from California has already mentioned some of the things, but I think they bear re- peating, and I will add some things.Mr. Chairman, let me start out by saying that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has absolutely no business regulating property insur- ance. This is just another example of the Department's tendency to stray into other jurisdictions while failing to address the glaring problems in its own core missions. To begin with, and first of all, Mr. Chairman, 50 States and the District of Columbia already have laws or regula- tions which prohibit unfair insurance discrimination. Let me repeat that, be- cause I think it needs to be repeated. All 50 States and the District of Colum- bia already have laws or regulations which prohibit unfair insurance dis- crimination. I think we can all agree that proper insurance underwriting should be based solely, and I will re- peat this and some may not agree, but it should be based on factors of eco- nomic risk; I will repeat, not on race, not on sex, and not on ethnicity. However, the plain fact is that Con- gress never, never intended for HUD to regulate property insurance. The Fed- eral Government, through the Fair Housing Act, expressly governs the practices of home sellers, landlords, mortgage lenders, and real estate bro- kers as they relate to housing discrimi- nation. It makes no mention of prop- erty insurance. Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, the McCarran-Ferguson Act, which is the linchpin of our current system of insur- ance regulation, says that unless a law, and I am quoting. ``* ** specifically relates to the business of insurance, that law shall not be deemed applicable to insurance practices.'' On a more practical level, HUD cannot handle even the responsibilities it now has, let alone assuming new ones. It cannot seem to keep its own house in order. Now it is taking on new responsibil- ities. The Department currently has over 150 programs on the books, and the en- tire Department has been listed by the GAO as being, and I am quoting, ``at risk'' of waste, fraud, and abuse. This is not a question of discrimination. I know that is a very sensitive point, but this is not a question of discrimina- tion. It is a question of jurisdiction. Unless we think HUD would make a great insurance regulator, Members should vote against the amendment. Congress never intended for HUD to have the authority to get into the in- surance business. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. KNOLLENBERG. I yield to the gentleman from Massachusetts. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to make the point to the gentleman that the reason this enforcement is contained in HUD is because the Fair Housing Act is contained in HUD. The reality is that when we were looking last year at where the best organization was, the Justice Department, the Department of Commerce, every single Federal agencylooks to the HUD testing program for direction. It has been singled out time and time again as having by far and away the greatest capabilities of any group or organization in enforcing fair housing throughout the entire Federal and State government. I would suggest to the gentleman that of course there are anti-discrimination laws filed in 50 States. That does not mean that there is not discrimination. What we have to recognize is simply because we pass a law here, and I appreciate the gen- tleman allowing me to continue to speak, but simply because we pass a law here in the Congress of the United States does not mean that that law gets implemented at the State level. Mr. KNOLLENBERG. Reclaiming my time briefly, the gentleman said let HUD do its job. That is not HUD's job. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield 3 minutes to the gen- tleman from Illinois [Mr. E WING ]. Mr. EWING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the Kennedy-Wa- ters amendment to strike section 209. I would like to thank the chairman, the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], for including this important language in the bill at the request of nine mem- bers of the Illinois delegation. Mr. Chairman, there are not too many industries left in our economy which are not heavily regulated by the Federal Government, but property in- surance is one of them. Under the McCarran-Ferguson Act, regulation of the insurance industry has been left to the States. This is greatly responsible for the stable, reliable insurance sys- tem we have today, which every Amer- ican counts on in difficult times. Unfortunately, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, an agency laden with waste and fraud, has recently decided to go beyond its au- thority by getting the Federal Govern- ment involved in regulating property insurance. HUD is currently writing regulations aimed at addressed the so- called practice of redlining, despite the fact that the States are already ad- dressing this issue where needed. HUD has no authority to write these regula- tions, and I strongly support section 209 of this bill, which will prohibit HUD from writing or implementing redline regulations. Mr. Chairman, I would remind the body that in the last Congress, con- trolled by the other party, they tried to pass a bill that would have allowed HUD to take on this responsibility and could not get the job done, and came back with a bill which allowed HUD to collect statistics on redlining, and that bill failed in the Senate. As if that were not enough, HUD has also awarded hundreds of dollars in taxpayers' money to liberal special in- terest groups to prepare studies on so- called redlining practices. HUD is using the questionable studies these groups write as a premise for starting inves- tigations against the insurance indus- try, which will probably lead, for all of us, to expensive litigation.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7889 July 27, 1995 Again, all this activity is taking place, despite the fact that HUD has no authority in this area. The insurance industry, which every American counts on every day of their lives, is a success story in part because the Federal Gov- ernment has kept its hands off. The amendment of the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. K ENNEDY ] and the gentlewoman from California [Ms. W ATERS ], would reverse this his- toric situation by allowing HUD to start regulating property insurance, and would open the door to government management of insurance. This Con- gress will be defined by our efforts to reduce the role and influence of the Federal Government. I strongly urge my colleagues to vote against bigger government by voting against this amendment. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I would like to briefly make the point that when the gen- tleman says that the Federal Govern- ment does not have the authority or HUD does not have the authority, the fact is that the courts have upheld the Fair Housing Act and HUD's role in the Fair Housing Act time and time again. The only correction that I can see in the department of HUD occurred under Sam Pierce, a Republican, and that has been cleaned up since. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina [Mr. W ATT]. Mr. WATT of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I definitely want to get this straight. We are talking about enforcement of the Fair Housing Act. That is the act that talks about provid- ing housing on an equal, nonracial basis. If people cannot get insurance on the property, they cannot get the loan, and so I am not quite sure how the gen- tlemen who keep professing that this has nothing to do with equal rights and civil rights, and that HUD has nothing to do with insurance because it deals with housing, how they think HUD could adequately deal with fair housing when insurers are discriminating, and people cannot get housing without in- surance, so how are they supposed to deal with their job under the Fair Housing Act? Mr. Chairman, I do not get it. I can- not understand what this argument is all about. If that were the case, why would it even be necessary to put this provision in the bill? We are striking a provision, this amendment would strike a provision in the bill which pre- vents HUD from using any money to enforce the insurance laws having to do with fair housing. Therefore, if it did not have anything to do with housing, what is it doing in the housing bill? I do not understand this argument. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Cali- fornia [Mr. R OYCE ].(Mr. ROYCE asked and was given per- mission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. ROYCE. I rise in opposition to the amendment, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment and in the interest of time, I'll put my statement in the R ECORDat this time. Section 209 is important in preventing HUD from pursuing duplicative regulations regarding property insurance. Property insurance regula- tions and authorities are already handled quite extensively in every State by State insurance regulators. These State regulators recognize that redlin- ing is an intolerable practice and they work to insure that all consumers regardless of eth- nicity have equal access to property insur- ance. So there is no need to have HUD add this unnecessary layer of Federal bureauc- racy. Section 209 will also send a message that Federal agencies should not be promulgating rules or programs beyond the purview they have been granted by Congress. Mr. Chairman, section 209 goes to the heart of what so many of us have come to Con- gress to do: Cut duplicative Federal programs, maintain the authority of our States and most importantly section 209 will keep a Federal agency from encroaching on the operations of our small businesses. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support section 209 and I would urge my colleagues to vote against the Kennedy-Waters amendment. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen- tleman from Louisiana [Mr. F IELDS ]. Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Mr. Chair- man, let me thank the gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding time to me, and let me thank him for all the hard work he has done in the past and is presently doing as it relates to fair housing, as well as the other coauthors of this amendment, the gentlewoman from California [Ms. W ATERS ] and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to mag- nify the point that this amendment is right on target, because this bill pro- hibits HUD from issuing any enforce- ment or rules that would apply to fair housing. I think that is simply unbe- lievable and unconscionable. Let me tell the Members why. First of all, this whole Fair Housing Act was passed, this portion of the Fair Housing Act that deals with tracking insurance, redlining, was passed under the Bush administration in 1989. I think the gentleman from North Caro- lina [Mr. W ATT] makes a very good point. How can one buy a home in America if they do not have mortgage insurance? I do not know the last time Members have mortgaged their homes or the last time we bought a home in America, but the last time I bought a home in Amer- ica I had to go to the bank. When I walked into the bank, before they loaned me the money I had to show that I had insurance on the property. Banks do not loan money to people who do not have insurance on homes, so it just makes practical sense to talk about insurance, protecting individualsso they can get insurance on homes, because in a real sense, what this de- bate is all about is actually giving them an opportunity to buy the home in the first place. /ballot2000 Mr. Chairman, if you cannot buy a home, if you do not have insurance, it makes practical sense that we put this kind of mechanism in the bill. It is al- ready in the Fair Housing Act. For us to have the audacity to come here on this floor and take it out and be upset with my friends, the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ], the gen- tlewoman from California [Ms. W A- TERS ], and the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], because they are trying to provide some equity to this legisla- tion, to me it is unbelievable. Mr. Chairman, how do we look con- stituents in the eyes in America? We know that redlining exists even in the insurance industry. I have people who are in my district, and I have had an insurance agency who called me and said, ``I cannot issue insurance in cer- tain ZIP Codes.'' What can you do about that? Last year we introduced legislation to deal with that issue. Everybody knows about American families. Insur- ance redlining still exists today in America and the only way to correct that is by having Federal agencies in- volved in making sure that everybody is treated fairly in the insurance busi- ness. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the dis- tinguished gentleman from Ohio [Mr. STOKES ], the former chairman. Mr. STOKES. I thank the distin- guished gentleman from Massachusetts for yielding me the time, and let me say that I am proud to be associated with the gentleman and with the gen- tlewoman from California [Ms. W A- TERS ] on this very important amend- ment. I rise in strong support of this amendment and congratulate both of them for the excellent and outstanding leadership they have given, not only in the area of fair housing but against any and all forms of discrimination wherever they have found it. Mr. Chairman, I have a letter that was written to me by Secretary Cisneros. It was written to me in my capacity as the ranking member of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and Inde- pendent Agencies. It was also written to our friend and colleague, the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], as chairman of the subcommittee. I want to refer to what he says about this amendment. He said: The fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD-Independent Agencies appropriations bill contains a pro- vision that would bar enforcement by HUD of the Fair Housing Act's prohibition on dis- crimination for an entire industry. The measure preempts a major civil rights law which has been on the books since 1968. I un- derstand Congressman Kennedy intends to offer an amendment that would strike thisCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7890 July 27, 1995 provision, and I wish to express my support for that amendment. He also says that: Section 209(a) of the bill would bar HUD from fulfilling its obligations under the Fair Housing Act to persons who have been treat- ed unfairly based on race or other prohibited factor in connection with property insur- ance. The provision would halt HUD inves- tigations, settlement negotiations and legal proceedings already under way in response to previously filed complaints of insurance dis- crimination. He ends his letter by saying: Barring enforcement of the Fair Housing Act's prohibition on discrimination in the property insurance business, even for a sin- gle year, is a serious retreat from notions of fairness and nondiscrimination that I believe we all share. He said: I ask you to take swift action to strike from the bill this affront to civil rights. I do not think, Mr. Chairman, that anyone here wants to be associated with action that is an affront to the civil rights laws of this country. I re- cently saw in the Wall Street Journal an article that says home loans to blacks and Hispanics soared last year, though they were still turned down more often than whites, according to Federal regulators. Mr. Chairman, I think we all under- stand this provision. I hope we will support the Kennedy-Waters-Stokes motion to strike. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentlewoman from Florida [Mrs. MEEK]. Mrs. MEEK of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I thank the gentleman for yield- ing me the time. Mr. Chairman, I have listened in- tently to the debate tonight regarding housing and I commend the strong work that the gentleman from Massa- chusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] and gentlewoman from California [Ms. W ATERS ], have done over the years, and to the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] and others, but it is ap- palling to see how those of us on the other side of the aisle want to turn back the clock of time on people who have struggled so hard all of these years. When we strike at housing laws, we strike at the very heart of discrimina- tion. If we want to put the B word, which is bigotry, into the record, you go to someone's housing. We work at something that keeps them from im- proving the quality of life, where they live. Not being able to get enforcement in housing is a crime. We can have as many laws on the book as we want to have, but if we do not have an enforce- ment vehicle, which they have talked about, there is no enforcement. Mr. Chairman, I worked for 12 years in the Florida legislature in trying to be sure that fair housing laws were en- forced. They were never enforced. They never would have been there if these two people had not worked on the Fed- eral level to give us something from the Federal level. The States are notgoing to enforce this and we know it. That is why we are passing on this ability to the States. What we are really doing is saying we do not want fair housing enforcement. We do not care about redlining because we are not redlined. We can hold our ears as if we are not hearing what is happening out there, but it is out there. I am saying to the Members, please, please, support this amend- ment. Please strike down any falling back into the old death throes of seg- regation and discrimination. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the distinguished gentlewoman from California [Ms. W ATERS ]. Ms. WATERS. Mr. Chairman, I will not try to deal with this business about HUD has no business. HUD did not just take over this area of responsibility. It is in law, and it was supported by Reagan and Bush. Let me just say this to my friends on the other side of the aisle: You do not know what it is like to be a person of color, to walk into a bank and not be able to get a loan. Even though you look at whites with the same income level, the same credit profile who can get loans. You do not know what it is like to live in a red- lined community and not be able to get insurance. I cannot tell you here to- night and make you understand that. I would simply ask you to get out into America, go into these cities, hold some hearings. Do not do this in the dark of night. Do not undo and disman- tle civil rights laws and fair housing laws that a lot of people sacrificed for. Do not take this kind of action simply because you have the power to do it. At least be fair about it. Give us a level playing field. Let us fight in the open. Let us fight in the hearings. Let us bring people out to tell you about rac- ism and discrimination. You give us an opportunity to do that, and we will fight you and we will win. I ask my col- leagues to support this amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself the balance of my time. I know full well the intent of the Kennedy amendment and I have not just empathy for but great concern about fair housing laws and their im- plementation across the country. As they operate presently, the legis- lation regarding fair housing requires that States be responsive to those re- quirements in place. The subject we are dealing with here, though, that relates to insurance involves the promulgation of regulations by the Department that exceeds their authority and it exceeds the parameters of the fair housing law itself. Historically insurance laws in this country have been controlled by the in- dividual States because of the great va- riety of circumstances within the States. The gentlewoman who just spoke and I served in the State legisla- ture together and we worked together to see how best we could get our State to deal with these problems in Califor-nia. I remember very specific conversa- tions when I was on the finance and in- surance committee with the gentle- woman about this problem, and I was concerned about this problem. In many other States there has been responsive- ness. I do not now what has happened in Massachusetts, but I would guess that legislature has been sensitive to this problem. Insurance laws controlled by the States have existed because of the great variety of needs across the coun- try. I personally feel very strongly that we should continue to put pressure on the States where we see difficulties. But to presume a cookie cutter from the Department of Housing in Washing- ton can serve the needs of the entire country, I must say, is a mistaken pre- sumption. In this case, I strongly support the concern expressed by my colleagues here. At the same time I strongly op- pose the amendment by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ]. I would urge a ``no'' vote. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K EN- NEDY ]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ] will be postponed. PARLIAMENTARY INQUIRY Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I have a parliamentary in- quiry. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will state it. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, just trying to understand where we are, I thought we had an agreement we were going to roll three or four votes. I wonder if the Chair could tell me how many votes we are at at the moment. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair would state to the gentleman that it is my understanding there are three short colloquies and the House will then vote on four ordered rollcall votes. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. I thank the Chair. Mr. HUNTER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], chairman of the subcommittee. I want to first start by thanking the gentleman for his commitment to solv- ing our international wastewater prob- lems\u00d0the gentleman is familiar with those, with the district that I have just south of his district that borders Mex- ico\u00d0particularly the cleanup of the New River, which is the river that flows north in Mexico, throughCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7891 July 27, 1995 Mexicali and ultimately into the Unit- ed States and travels about 50 miles north into the Salton Sea. As the gentleman knows, it is one of the most polluted waterways in North America and the New River carriers millions of gallons of water per day of municipal and industrial waste into my district. The gentleman has recognized that problem, and has been helping us a lot. We thank the gentleman for that. On page 54 of the subcommittee re- port, there is concern expressed over EPA's use of subpoenas to collect data from U.S. companies operating in Mex- ico. Those companies are companies that are in the Mexicali area. They op- erate and some of them discharge their waste into the New River which flows north into the United States and then into the Salton Sea. The report ques- tions the authority of the EPA to serve these subpoenas and whether this ac- tion may be a violation of NAFTA. After following this issue closely, I just wanted to clarify that in this instance the EPA was in contact with both the International Boundary and Water Commission and the Mexican Environ- mental Agency throughout the oper- ation. Understanding that any toxics dumped in the New River in Mexico ul- timately ends up in the United States, I am supportive and have been support- ive of EPA's attempt to solicit vol- untary submissions by U.S. companies in Mexico. It was following an inad- equate response to this request that the EPA issued the subpoenas in co- operation and consultation with Mexi- can authorities and the IBWC. I would also note at that time the new agencies established under NAFTA to assist with the cleanup of the border environ- ment were not yet organized. As a re- sult, the EPA worked with the existing international agencies to gather gen- eral information on chemical dis- charges as they are allowed to do under the Toxic Substances Control Act. I agreed with their position in terms of trying to identify who was putting this toxic discharge into the New River, but I want to let the chairman know that I am in full agreement with his overall conclusion that our agen- cies, especially the EPA, should not overstep their bounds in the enforce- ment of our laws. I want to thank him for this opportunity to comment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will yield, I ap- preciate very much the clarification of the gentleman from California [Mr. HUNTER ] of the facts involved in this circumstance. I understand the com- plexities involved with international wastewater cleanups. I agree with the gentleman that the EPA's action in this instance was in the best interests of the residents not only of his district but of our State. I look forward to find- ing a long-term solution to the New River problem. I expect any future ac- tions by the EPA to continue to be in consultation with the appropriate international agencies.Mr. HUNTER. I thank the gentleman. Congratulations on a long and success- ful day on this floor. Mr. LEWIS of California. It is a pleasure doing business with the gen- tleman. Mr. HEINEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word, and if I may, I would like to enter into a col- loquy with the distinguished gen- tleman from California, the chairman. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will yield, I would be happy to enter into a col- loquy with the gentleman. Mr. HEINEMAN. I thank the chair- man. I have been working with him and his staff on the need for EPA to con- struct a new consolidated research fa- cility in Research Triangle Park, NC. Currently the EPA is scattered in 11 separate buildings which are privately owned and in bad shape. I personally toured these facilities earlier this year. Studies have shown that renovating the existing buildings and signing new leases will cost upwards of $400 million. /ballot2015 We can build a new facility for $232 million, and I have been working with the committee in support of this project. Mr. LEWIS of California. I am more than slightly aware of my colleague's support for this project. He has been very persuasive in making his point to our committee. Today's discussion has indicated the difficulty we are having with money between accounts and because of that, the pressure is very, very great. The gentleman has, indeed, caused all of us to scratch our heads and try to figure out how we can readjust some of these accounts. We are going to look further between now and conference, but I commit to the gentleman that over the years we are going to make sure that we have carefully analyzed the alternatives to see how we can help. Mr. HEINEMAN. Why not this year? Mr. LEWIS of California. EPA has two other major infrastructure projects ongoing, including a new head- quarters in D.C. The budget will not sustain 3 projects at one time. There is also a problem with authorization. The building is only authorized for $159 mil- lion. To my knowledge, no attempts have been made in past Congresses to address this authorization problem. As the gentleman knows, it is against the rules of the House to appropriate funds for a project of this kind which is not authorized. Mr. HEINEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have been made aware of this and I have discussed this with key members of the authorizing committee, includ- ing the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. S HUSTER ] and the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. G ILCHREST ], the ranking member. I am working with them to update and increase the authorization for this project. If I may address the authorization problem, can the gentleman assumethat he will work to address the appro- priations for the facility in fiscal year 1997? Mr. LEWIS. I can tell you that the gentleman has had a very significant effect in the committee of the gen- tleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. S HU- STER ] as well as with the chairman himself. I also know that my colleague, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. L IGHTFOOT ], is very sensitive to this problem; and we are doing everything we can to find a substantial base of funds to see if we cannot overcome the difficulty that you are involved with. I recognize the need for the facility. I think we should find some way to address it. GSA could be another option, and I understand that they would like to build this facility. EPA has made this a very high prior- ity, and the gentleman is commended for his thorough work on this project. I just wish I could say, yes, now, but in- deed the point is, when an individual Member is concentrating like this to solve a problem in his district, he in- deed gets the Congress' attention. Mr. HEINEMAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his under- standing and agreement. Mr. NEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I thank the sub- committee chairman, my colleague from California, Mr. L EWIS and stand to give strong support to the bill, H.R. 2099. In particular, I want to support the good reductions in the United States EPA's overall operating budget. As the gentleman from California knows, we have discussed the concerns of the people of Ohio's 18th Congres- sional District, people in the State of Ohio and the people in the Midwest who have suffered tremendously under the Clean Air Act and the EPA provi- sions that directly pertained to our area in Ohio. The Clean Air Act was a liberal, over- zealous, too-far-reaching measure when it spoke, in part, to the concerns deal- ing with acid rain. There were some merits to the bill, and there is a need to make sure our environment is safe. I want to make that very clear. There was a study by NAPA which was a 10-year study at a half a billion dollar cost to the taxpayers, stated specifically that, in fact, the changes in the Clean Air Act as pertains to acid rain were not going to make a dif- ference in cleaning up the environ- ment. This was not the problem. Still, the full thrust of trying to put our people in the Ohio Valley out of work was accomplished in that bill, and I just want to speak a little bit about the truth and what that has done to the Ohio Valley to the tens of thou- sands of jobs that have been lost for no reason. I want to let the people in the EPA know, Mr. Chairman, that when we talk about reducing their overall budg- et of $2.5 billion and the enforcement budget by $129 million, that is a goodCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7892 July 27, 1995 start. It is a fine start in my humble opinion, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I also want to remind the people in the EPA that, in fact, we are going to be watching for any fur- ther problems they want to create as a result of reductions, and we are going to be watching how they treat people in this country. It is fine to have clean air; we want to have that for our chil- dren. But we want to point out that one should not retaliate against the people of the United States for no rea- son. We want them to know that there are consequences for their actions and that people in the Ohio Valley, in the 18th Congressional District, have un- dergone tremendous suffering amongst their families. I want to thank the gentleman for his willingness to work with us as this process goes on. It is the first time that I can recall, from my time in gov- ernment when I was in Ohio, that somebody has been willing to listen and someone is willing to say we have got to use some good sense and not just take actions that in the end do not count for anything. I want to thank the gentleman for that on behalf of my constituents. Mr. LEWIS. Well, I must say, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. N EY] has been a very, very effective voice in re- gard to the problems we face with EPA. Literally, across the country we have heard voices that were expressing con- cern about unnecessary regulation, but indeed, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. NEY] has been one of the leading advo- cates. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman should know that my district is probably the most smog-impacted district in the country. I have chaired a committee in connection with clean air questions in California. I authored the law that cre- ated the toughest air quality manage- ment district in all of the country. Having said that, I too find this agen- cy in excess, regulation upon regula- tion, not just duplication, but useless procedures that get in the way, often, of solving problems. And they cost jobs in the meantime. I very much appre- ciate the gentleman's voice in this re- gard and his help and advice has been very, very important in the bill we are considering tonight. Mr. NEY. Mr. Chairman, some of my family moved from Ohio to California, so I was out there quite a lot, and my grandmother and aunts and uncles. My grandmother moved out there, any my aunts and uncles are out there cur- rently. I am concerned about them. We do have to solve our problem out there and we do have to make it clean in the urban centers across this coun- try, but I appreciate the fact that you have listened to a segment that did not cause the problem and was so unfairly targeted by overzealous bureaucrats. I thank the gentleman for that. Mr. RIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I seek recognition to engage the distinguished gentlemanfrom California [Mr. L EWIS], the sub- committee chairman, in a colloquy, but I first want to thank him as chair- man of the subcommittee producing this appropriations bill for his work on the bill under what I know are very dif- ficult circumstances. As a military veteran myself, I am particularly sensitive to the impor- tance of keeping our promises to our veterans, and I support the fiscal year 1996 VA\u00b1HUD and Independent Agen- cies appropriations bill. I believe, however, with the gentle- man's indulgence, Mr. Chairman, there is one aspect of the legislation that should be clarified. As the gentleman well knows, I have strongly and consistently advocated for the construction of the replacement Veterans Administration medical cen- ter planned for Travis Air Force Base in Solano County in my congressional District. Therefore, I was deeply dis- appointed that budget restrictions, budget realities, forced the committee to forgo this and other construction projects. As the gentleman well knows, there is a great need for an additional medi- cal facility in northern California as a result of the closure of the medical center in Martinez, CA, in the after- math of the 1989 earthquake that we experienced in northern California. Our veterans in northern California should receive medical care within their designated catchment area and currently some veterans have to drive up to 8 hours to the nearest medical fa- cility. Mr. Chairman, the subcommittee, on page 19 of its report, has directed the Veterans Administration to develop a cost estimate for an outpatient clinic, in lieu of a medical center, in time for the funds to be included in this bill at a later stage of consideration. The Travis Medical Center would have been constructed adjacent to the David Grant Medical Center, a state-of- the-art Air Force hospital. This would have permitted a unique joint venture between the VA and the Air Force. Services would have been provided for both active duty personnel and veter- ans through a cost-effective medical sharing arrangement. In fact, in anticipation of construc- tion of the replacement hospital, Fed- eral funds, pursuant to previous con- gressional appropriations, have already been expended at the Travis site for both a parking lot and a warehouse. Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I am seek- ing assurances that the committee is committed to including full funding in this bill to build the outpatient clinic; that funds previously appropriated for the Veterans Administration medical center but not spent can be used for the outpatient clinic; that it will be built, in fact, at Travis Air Force Base; and that it will be able to share medi- cal technology and other essential services in a joint venture with the Air Force hospital. Given the number of unserved veter- ans since the closure of Martinez, weneed to build, equip, and make oper- ational the proposed outpatient clinic as swiftly as possible. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS]. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I want to commend my colleague for his tenacity on this issue. Not a day has gone by when he did not push me and other members of the committee on this matter. Adequate care for the veterans in northern California is clearly a priority for him and for the many members of Operation VA. I truly regret that budget realities forced us to omit funds for a full medi- cal center; however, in response to the gentleman's specific questions, I can assure the gentleman that he is going in the right direction in the assump- tions that he has presented. The committee will appropriate all the necessary funds in fiscal year 1996 for the clinic with the VA's help in identifying the amounts needed. Any previously appropriated but unspent funds may be used for that clinic. Fur- ther, it is the committee's intent that the outpatient clinic will be built at Travis Air Force Base and will be able to share facilities with David Grant Medical Center. Mr. Chairman, I must say that my colleague has been more than persist- ent. The gentleman has developed a base of knowledge and understanding of the needs of the people in all those counties in that huge territory of Cali- fornia. The gentleman has commu- nicated that well to me, and also to people in the Veterans' Administra- tion, as well as our committee, and I appreciate it. Mr. RIGGS. Mr. Chairman, I appre- ciate the subcommittee Chairman's un- derstanding and support in this matter. As the gentleman well knows, we are talking about a veteran population that is the equivalent of something like 28 or 29 States, so I am glad that we are able to provide for them in this bill by construction funding for a mod- ern outpatient clinic that will, again, enhance our ability to serve the vet- eran population of northern California.

Mr. Chairman, I take this time to in- quire of the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on VA, HUD and Independent Agencies as to what the plans are for the remaining part of this evening. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. STOKES. I yield to the gen- tleman from California.Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I appreciate the gentleman in- quiring. I, frankly, did not intend to discuss it before he and I could sit down and chat about it, because there is not a deal until the gentleman and I have signed off on the deal. In the meantime, I have, as the gen- tleman knows, wanted to get through this evening, if at all possible. It is very apparent that we are going to have difficulty doing that before 2:00 in the morning. So we are attempting to take a series of items and have time limitations on them that could involve the rolling of a couple of votes and then could in- volve a couple of, three or four items that would be voted on tomorrow, if the authors of the amendments agreed to roll them over. Having said that, I do want the gen- tleman and I to talk about the specifics before we go further. That could get us out of here somewhere close to 10:00 to- night, but the unanimous consent re- quest would also include a provision that we could debate on items like the space station item, like the gentle- man's amendment that would elimi- nate language and so on tomorrow and have the debate limited to those amendments that are in the R ECORD now so we could start at 9:00 in the morning and be through for certain by 3:00 in the afternoon. That is the pattern that we are going in. We are looking at time limits, but I want to discuss it with the gentleman personally before we finally agree to that. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, did the gentleman want additional time for he and I to discuss the matter before we bring something of substance to the other Members? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will continue to yield, if we could proceed on the next amendment and the gentleman and I discuss it, I think that would be help- ful. I find the gentleman to be very in- structive when I have those discus- sions. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his response. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, the next amendment would be the Kaptur amendment and a time limit of 10 minutes on each side, and the gen- tleman and I could have this conversa- tion, as we go forward. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his response. /ballot2115 Mr. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I would like to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS]. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. TORRES. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I would tell the gentleman, I would hope to be able to proceed withCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7896 July 27, 1995 the amendment offered by the gentle- woman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ], for 10 minutes on each side, if we can get that approved, get this agreed to, and then proceed with the gentleman's col- loquy, subsequent to the Kaptur vote. Mr. TORRES. I would be in agree- ment with that, Mr. Chairman. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I will be asking for a broader unanimous consent request in a few moments, but initially I ask unanimous consent to proceed with the Kaptur amendment, with a limitation of time of 20 minutes, 10 minutes on each side. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. LEWIS of California. The vote would roll until tomorrow. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair would tell the gentleman, that authority on rolling the vote already exists. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MS . KAPTUR Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Ms. K APTUR : Page 20, line 25, after the dollar amount insert the following: ``(increased by $234,000,000)''. Page 21, line 15, after the dollar amount in- sert the following: ``(increased by $234,000,000)''. Page 64, line 16, after the dollar amount in- sert the following: ``(reduced by $234,000,000)''. Ms. KAPTUR (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con- sent that the amendment be considered as read and printed in the R ECORD . The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentlewoman from Ohio? There was no objection. The CHAIRMAN. Under the unani- mous consent agreement, the gentle- woman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] will be recognized for 10 minutes, and the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] will be recognized for 10 minutes in op- position. The Chair recognizes the gentle- woman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ]. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the amendment we are offering has been redrafted from this afternoon, and I doubt that there will be any points of order that will be able to be raised against the amend- ment. Essentially what this amend- ment does is to maintain the successful anti-drug program that has existed since 1988 when Jack Kemp, in the Bush administration, began this pro- gram. In the Case bill, Mr. Chairman, this program was completely zeroed out. During the deliberations of the full committee, I attempted to restore these funds, and we came within five votes of doing so on a bipartisan basis. Sixteen members of the committee were absent for that vote. We went to the Committee on Rules attempting toget a rule that would permit us to offer an amendment concerning this pro- gram on the floor. This is what we are attempting to do this evening. Our amendment will shift $234 million from the Federal Emer- gency Management Agency's disaster relief account and shift it to the public housing modernization account, where it is earmarked for anti-drug activi- ties. This is a budget-neutral amend- ment, and in fact, even with our amendment passing, this program will have $54 million less in it than in the prior years during which it has been funded. I do not think any person in this Chamber could agree with me more when I say that there is no greater scourge affecting our country in every city, town, and neighborhood, than the scourge of illicit drugs and drug traf- ficking. No Member here wants to be in the position of turning back the progress that has been made in this ex- tremely successful program. Every Member, before they vote, should call their mayor, they should call the direc- tor of their local housing authority, and ask them how successful this pro- gram has been. I stood in Chicago when Charlie Hayes served in this Chamber and watched snipers on the roofs of those housing projects in Chicago controlling the activities of thousands of people who lived in those buildings and in the surrounding neighborhoods. Mr. Chair- man, this program cleans up those streets and projects that were out of control. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Massachusetts, J OE KENNEDY , the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Commu- nity Opportunity of the Committee on Banking and Financial Services. Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentle- woman from Ohio. This is a program that has done an enormous amount of good to housing authorities and ten- ants in those housing authorities throughout the country. Just this week I visited two separate housing authorities where the tenants have finally gotten control of the drug dealers and the drug pushers that live in those housing authorities, and been able to move them out. This is the kind of self-determination that we want to see take place in tenant ownership and in tenant determination in these local housing authorities that for the first time gives people a sense that they can take control over their neighborhoods. Why would we go about trying to cut the program that does the most amount of good, of ridding these pro- grams and projects of the worst tenant occupants, of those who are abusing their neighbors, and give the power to those tenants who want to put some order in their lives, who want to take control over their destinies? That is what these drug enforcement grants do. I think the gentlewoman is to becommended for her persistence in try- ing to get this taken up today. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I proudly yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. S HAW]. Mr. SHAW. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time. Mr. Chairman, I would like to con- gratulate the gentlewoman on a very well-purposed and very good program for which she is trying to get some money, but I would say, having lived through Hurricane Andrew down in south Florida, my kids having gone through hurricane Hugo in South Caro- lina, having looked at what has hap- pened in California with the disastrous earthquakes, FEMA, leave it alone. FEMA is so important. It is an insur- ance policy. We in the Congress say we know that there are going to be disas- ters, we know we have to be ready, we know we have to sharpen our ability to be able to react to these national disas- ters. It is absolutely nothing less than good planning, and it is absolutely im- perative that we hold this program to- gether. The problem of drugs is absolutely out of sight. We need to talk more about it. We need to do more about it, but FEMA has absolutely nothing to do with it. It is absolutely nongermane to the subject matter which the gentle- woman and I are both concerned about. Let us leave FEMA alone. FEMA needs to be left intact. It is nothing less than good planning. I would hope that we would soundly defeat this amendment. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SHAW. I yield to the gentle- woman from Ohio. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I re- spect the gentleman's opinion. There are sufficient funds in FEMA to cover natural disasters that have occurred. Would the gentleman agree that there are human disasters occurring every day where drug lords control the neigh- borhoods in which we live? Mr. SHAW. The gentlewoman is abso- lutely correct, and as a matter of fact, tomorrow I am introducing a bill that is going to absolutely cut the underpinnings out of Most Favored Na- tion status for countries that do not cooperate with us in the war against drugs. I know the gentlewoman would want to take a close look at this par- ticular bill, but FEMA must be left in- tact. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 21\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from New York, Mr. C HARLES RANGEL , the distin- guished ranking member of the Com- mittee on Ways and Means, who knows more about this terrible, terrible prob- lem than anyone I know. Mr. RANGEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to support the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio. It is really educational to see how the good, de- cent people from the other side of the aisle seem to believe in everything that we are trying to do here, but not in this bill.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7897 July 27, 1995 There is no one more dedicated in fighting drugs than my friend, the gen- tleman from Florida [Mr. S HAW]. He is going to try to make certain that the countries producing the drugs do not enjoy a friendly relationship with us. However, talking about national disas- ters, as an American, what is more of a disaster than seeing a child born in public housing, and just because it is a male, a boy, that we can say that that kid is either going to die or end up in jail before he is 15? What is more of a disaster than to see a human being that has the same dreams that you and I have, to one day move to decent housing, to get an edu- cation and be productive, and all the statistics would say ``Because of color, because of background, and because they are in that public housing, they will never be able to break out.'' What a great national disaster. Secretary Kemp saw it, and he did not see it from the high towers in some building, he went into this public housing, he talked with the parents, and he felt their dreams and tried to do some- thing. For a lousy $238 million, we are going to say that these kids do not deserve it. What are we talking about? No, it is not jails. That would get the Members excited. It is not mandatory sentences. It is not more cops. That gets the vital juices flowing. It is education, it is mentoring, it is giving someone an op- portunity to say that it is not just two strikes against you; that in this coun- try, everyone can make it. For God's sakes, it is Veteran's Day for Korean war veterans. Can we not do something decent? That side already struck out hope for the homeless, they struck out those that just want to get a house and a picket fence, because the house is located someplace that they cannot get insurance. Do not be dic- tated to and just say what you cannot do, just break out of it sometime to- night and let the conscience that you have say that you are able to do some- thing. Do not wait for some hope or dreams tomorrow. It may be too late. This money merely says ``Just be- cause of who you are, just because you were born in the projects, the United States of America will not give up to you.'' Members did not give up on these kids when they went in the Army. Do not do it tonight. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, would the Chair advise me how much time I have remaining? The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] has 31\u00a42min- utes remaining. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gen- tleman from Louisiana [Mr. F IELDS ]. /ballot2130 Mr. FIELDS of Louisiana. Mr. Chair- man, I thank the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] for yielding me the time, and I wanted to commend her for an excellent job in fighting for the drug elimination program in this country. Ifwe were sitting here tonight talking about building jails and prisons and housing facilities, or turning public housing into jails and prisons, there would be little debate on the other side of the aisle, but we are only trying to provide kids with hope and oppor- tunity. Mr. Chairman, I was at the Ordonwood Apartment Complex this past weekend in my own district, and I had an opportunity to meet with kids and their parents and also had an op- portunity to meet with the manage- ment of that facility. They looked me dead in the eyes and said, ``Congress- man F IELDS , it is because of programs like the drug elimination program that we are able to run the drug dealers and drug pushers out of our community.'' Now we are here tonight talking about the very program that is benefit- ing this housing facility and we are talking about cutting it out. I said ear- lier on the House floor tonight that we are already cutting out drug-free schools and communities. We are tell- ing kids in public school that we are not going to teach you to say no to drugs; we are just going to say, ``Just say no to drugs,'' but we will not teach about drug education. We are telling kids in public housing that they can use drugs by eliminating the drug elimination program. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The gentlewoman from Ohio is recognized for 21\u00a42min- utes. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, let me just say, in response to the gentleman from Florida who spoke about will the FEMA account be whole, I served on the Committee on Appropriations for three terms now. There are funds in the FEMA account. In fact, we have moved other funds from the FEMA ac- count, because they were unexpended, to other purposes within the bill. In addition to that, these dollars for the drug elimination program do not spend out at a 100 percent rate, they spend out at a 7 percent rate, which means that the drawdown would be very slow and measured. I think it would be very unwise of us, however, to zero out an account that has been in existence and working since 1988 and having success throughout this coun- try in every State in the Union, in towns and cities whose names you will recognize on this list of beneficiary communities. In my own community of Toledo, Ohio, I can tell you that in one year the presence of this program resulted in a 20 percent reduction in crime asso- ciated with drugs in the neighborhoods that benefited from the program. Secu- rity cars, police monitoring, work with the sheriff, all of the various patrols that were necessary have made an in- credible difference. Mr. Chairman, I think that for those of our colleagues who may not be fa- miliar with this program, please think carefully before you vote on this. It islikely your community is on this list. If you are not sure, come and see me, but, in any case, over 2,000 commu- nities across this country are benefit- ing today. The other dollars in the ac- counts that exist in this bill have been cut substantially by almost 25 percent. The dollars are not there for your mayors to choose between will they take care of the homeless when those funds are cut by half or will they deal with drug dealers in these neighbor- hoods. We must earmark these dollars. The money is there in FEMA. We are not asking for a whole lot. This will make a tremendous amount of dif- ference. Let us put these people in jail and clean up our streets. Please vote ``yes'' on the Kaptur amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself the balance of my time. Mr. Chairman, we have discussed this earlier, but the intriguing thing about the amendment of the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ], which is dif- ferent than the amendment she had earlier, is that she is recommending that one take $234 million and transfer it from FEMA to the public housing modernization account. That is a re- flection of my earlier commentary that we are hopeful that that modernization account will become a vehicle for a new war on drugs in these very same facilities that we are worried about. We are all in the same ballpark in that connection. Mr. Chairman, the problem lies in that if you take all that money from FEMA, suddenly you have no disaster assistance. If we were actually talking about budget authority instead of out- lay, we would be busting the budget and it would not be in order at all. Having said that, we do not want to zero FEMA, and let me suggest why we do not need to. As we said earlier, within the current public housing modernization ac- counts, in this year's proposal there is $2.5 billion. Left over in former ac- counts from former years there is an- other $6 billion. To say the least, those accounts do not just spend out slowly; the agency has not been very good at using those moneys. Now, I think be- tween the gentlewoman and myself and my ranking member we can encourage them to tap some of that money and make sure it is used for this purpose without having to strip FEMA. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to less- en the commitment any more than the gentlewoman does, but we do not want to find ourselves in a position where we zero out FEMA, and, only because of that, I have to ask for a ``no'' vote on the gentlewoman's amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment of the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the ayes ap- peared to have it.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7898 July 27, 1995 Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I demand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. KAPTUR ] will be postponed. Are there other amendments to title II? Mr. TORRES. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I rise to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Cali- fornia, the chairman of the subcommit- tee, if he will please engage me. As the chairman and I have discussed along with the ranking minority mem- ber, there is a contentious provision in the VA\u00b1HUD appropriations bill which prohibits funding for HUD in certain instances. HUD would no longer have the ability to investigate under the Fair Housing Act any State or local unit of government that has adopted a law or a regulation requiring the spo- ken or written word of the English lan- guage or declaring English as the offi- cial language. This comes as a result of a case in the town of Allentown, PA, which has passed a nonbinding English- only resolution. After HUD reviewed the case, it de- termined that there was not any dis- crimination because the resolution was nonbinding and not an ordinance of fact. Therefore, it was not enforced. The Office of Fair and Equal Housing did its job and the system worked. Mr. Chairman, this provision in the bill seeks to respond really to a nonissue. I am asking the chairman in this instance whether he could provide some assurances of rather than be- laboring this issue here late into the night tonight that we might have some resolution in conference. Mr. LEWIS of California. If the gen- tleman will yield, first I very much ap- preciate the gentleman asking me to enter into this colloquy, for I feel very strongly that the gentleman is on the right track. I think he has described the circumstances accurately. There is not an ordinance, or a local law in place. It is not necessary to have this language. It seems to me as we go to conference in view of that, that we ought to be working to eliminate this language. I feel very strongly that the voice of the gentleman ought to be heard in these matters and I am going to do all that I can to see that it is heard. Mr. TORRES. I thank the gentleman for his assurances to work on this. Mr. LEWIS of California. If the gen- tleman would yield further, you were describing to me earlier some very spe- cific circumstances relative to a dan- ger sign and otherwise. I think it would be helpful to have some of that concern on the record. Mr. TORRES. The issue here is at the whole question of English-only provi- sions, where we have instances, as I am talking about now in public housing, where there may be elderly persons, American citizens, who because oftheir age have not learned exact Eng- lish, cannot read difficult, intricate in- structions; notice of eviction, notices of an impending tornado coming or a hurricane, or perhaps even a sign. The fact that a sign is written in a non- English language really would give rise to this kind of onerous provision. My point is that we cannot begin to impose these kind of English-only provisions where we have lives at stake, where we have the security and the safety of peo- ple in effect. This is the basis for this kind of provision which I do not feel has any place at this time. Mr. BONILLA. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word to engage with the subcommittee chairman in a col- loquy about an often forgotten group of Americans, that is, specifically fami- lies that live in colonias along the United States-Mexico border. Today as we consider this VA-HUD appropriations bill on the floor, I ask my colleagues to seek justice, fairness and equity for the poor American fami- lies living in these colonias. I along with other border area rep- resentatives have worked hard to edu- cate our colleagues in Congress about how desperately these colonias need basic infrastructure and sanitation, a lot of things that we that live in neigh- borhoods throughout this country often take for granted. The colonias are substandard residen- tial subdivisions located along the United States side of the border with Mexico. Most colonias are unincor- porated, low income, primarily His- panic neighborhoods with substandard housing, unpaved roads and inadequate drainage. Even though we are now in the mid 1990s, these American citizens do not have running water in their homes and are forced to use outhouses or substandard septic tanks in their homes. The human cost is staggering. The Texas Water Development Board esti- mates that in Texas alone, there are 300,000 residents living in 1,200 colonias. Last year, with the help of the gen- tleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], we were fortunate to get congressional funding for the first time for colonia water projects and we appreciated the efforts of my friend the gentleman from Ohio very much. This year as we work to set priorities and reduce the Federal deficit, I want to thank the gentleman from Califor- nia [Mr. L EWIS], the chairman, for de- manding a meaningful commitment to improving the health and environ- mental conditions along the 2,000-mile Texas-Mexico border. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will yield, first I want my colleagues to know that the gentleman from Texas has been very, very effective in advocating his case regarding this problem, communicat- ing to each of us just how serious it is. The committee's action provides a major step in making sure Americans who live in the colonias are truly part of America. I very much appreciate notjust your work but the courtesy and in- telligence with which you have shared your problems with me. We look for- ward to continuing to work with you and help in every way we can. Mr. BONILLA. I thank the chairman. The committee has allocated $100 mil- lion for projects that will address many of these water problems along the bor- der. I would also like to thank the chairman for his work for the concerns of many other Hispanic issues along the border from Texas all the way to California, the gentleman's home State. He has been more than under- standing and compassionate as we have dealt with these tough appropriations matters in the last year. Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS]. Mr. Chairman, on June 24, a commu- nity called Pleasantville in Houston, Texas, some 40 years old, 3,000 families, experienced a warehouse fire just be- hind their pecan trees, a major ware- house fire of some 500,000 square feet, a warehouse filled with drums holding various chemicals including corrosives, flammables, combustibles, plastics and other hazardous items. These people had been living in their community for quite a long time and were concerned that they were now neighbors to what might be called a hazardous site. As the gentleman might be aware, I have an amendment proposed. However, I would like to make sure that in discussing this issue with you, and I can share with you the anecdotes or the stories about ``Meet- ing on Fire Does Little to Douse Resi- dents' Worries'' and ``Residents Fear Rebuilding of Burned Warehouses,'' and, of course, ``More Soil Samples Necessary to be Taken to Check for Contamination.'' But the real issue, Mr. Chairman, is the utilization of Superfund dollars to do emergency cleanups near residential areas. When I say ``near,'' I am talking about your backyard looking at the warehouse. This is a very close community. Be- fore offering this amendment, I would like to see whether or not we can en- gage in an agreement to emphasize be- fore the Environmental Protection Agency the importance of emergency cleanups near residential areas and the fastness, if you will, of that cleanup. I might add, Mr. Chairman, in inquir- ing of the Environmental Protection Agency to assist us, though they have worked with our State agencies and our local government has worked tire- lessly, there was a question of re- sources and a question of speed. But yet I have these 3,000 families, some of them senior citizens, and I was out there on the day of the fire. Imme- diately upon hearing of this incident, out to the shelter, out into the neigh- borhood, I could not breathe. /ballot2145 And there is still an air quality prob- lem and there is still a need for soilCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7899 July 27, 1995 samples and wipe samples. So, Mr. Chairman, I would like to see whether we can provide some guidance to the EPA but as well work on this issue with reference to conference. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I very much appreciate the gen- tlewoman bringing this matter to my attention. It is obviously a very serious circumstance. I think the gentlewoman heard me say that one of my difficul- ties with EPA is sometimes they are not nearly so responsive as I might like. But in Superfund, especially, we have had, to say the least, some major problems with the way that program is implemented. To suggest that Superfund might be able to be used effectively as an advi- sor as well as a source of revenue and otherwise to deal with a human cir- cumstance like this tells a different story that is a very important story. I would be more than pleased to work with the gentlewoman and commu- nicate with EPA, but to push them also to be responsive to this serious emer- gency circumstance. I might further suggest that FEMA, indeed, could be a source as well and I would like to talk with the gentle- woman carefully about various avenues that we could pursue. My ranking member, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. STOKES ] is more than responsive to me in these kinds of circumstances and it is my guess that working with the gen- tlewoman, we together could have an effect and I know that we both would be willing to. Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for that. The gen- tleman from Ohio, Mr. S TOKES , has been stellar in terms of issues dealing with communities, but particularly in mentioning this issue to the gen- tleman, I was very gratified of his con- cern. This has disturbed this community now for a number of weeks in the very hot summer. In fact, they are now on their third blaze on this site. Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gen- tleman from California and to the ranking member, Mr. S TOKES , I would hope that maybe we could also confer before conference to have this possibly referred there and utilized there. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I must say, that the gentlewoman is demonstrating a good deal of under- standing of the process by raising the question in this fashion, for should we wait for some preliminary action at least all the way through conference, that could take us to September or Oc- tober, and Lord knows what happens beyond that. In the meantime, we ought to be act- ing on this and I intend to do every- thing I can, along with the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], and indeed if we have not come close to helping the gentlewoman solve the problem by then, conference is very appropriate. Ms. JACKSON-LEE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to join the gentleman in that and work as we speak, and thatmeans immediately, in order to solve this problem for this community. I thank the chairman of the sub- committee for his willingness to work with me, and I thank the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ], the ranking member, for his leadership. I think we can get this problem solved and get these folks in Pleasantville, in the City of Houston, the service they need with respect to this hazardous fire and the warehouse situation and cleanup as well. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, to my knowledge, there are no additional amendments to title II. I would hope that what we might do is proceed to title III and then move to the DeFazio amendment, as per our earlier agreement. The CHAIRMAN. Are there any fur- ther amendments to title II? If not, the Clerk will designate title III. The text of title III is as follows: TITLE III INDEPENDENT AGENCIES AMERICAN BATTLE MONUMENTS COMMISSION SALARIES AND EXPENSES For necessary expenses, not otherwise pro- vided for, of the American Battle Monu- ments Commission, including the acquisition of land or interest in land in foreign coun- tries; purchases and repair of uniforms for caretakers of national cemeteries and monu- ments outside of the United States and its territories and possessions; rent of office and garage space in foreign countries; purchase (one for replacement only) and hire of pas- senger motor vehicles; and insurance of offi- cial motor vehicles in foreign countries, when required by law of such countries; $20,265,000, to remain available until ex- pended: Provided, That where station allow- ance has been authorized by the Department of the Army for officers of the Army serving the Army at certain foreign stations, the same allowance shall be authorized for offi- cers of the Armed Forces assigned to the Commission while serving at the same for- eign stations, and this appropriation is here- by made available for the payment of such allowance: Provided further, That when trav- eling on business of the Commission, officers of the Armed Forces serving as members or as Secretary of the Commission may be re- imbursed for expenses as provided for civil- ian members of the Commission: Provided further, That the Commission shall reim- burse other Government agencies, including the Armed Forces, for salary, pay, and allow- ances of personnel assigned to it.

Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr. MONTGOMERY ], and that he be per- mitted to control that time. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 21\u00a42minutes. Mr. Chairman, the issue before us is the issue of Selective Service, a ves- tigial bureaucracy of the cold war. The subcommittee in its wisdom eliminated funding for the Selective Service, re- duced it by $17 million, with the idea that the agency itself would be elimi- nated. My amendment would reduce the funding by $17 million, but put the agency into deep standby; that is, give it an opportunity to enter into the late 20th century and develop off-the-shelf technology in case of the remote hap- penstance of a conscription in a na- tional emergency, that they could go forward, but not continue the postcard registration that is in effect today. Mr. Chairman, from the beginning there has been no military necessity for Selective Service and the registra- tion, the roster report. Jimmy Carter's 1979 Director of Selective Service found that 8 to 10 days could be saved by reg- istration, but that because of the bot- tleneck at the training facilities, not one troop would be delivered one day sooner to the battlefield, and of coursethat day would not cutback very much on training. In the Department of Defense a 1993 report found that there was no mili- tary necessity for continuing draft reg- istration. This is an opportunity to save $17 million over the outyears, that is $102 million in our 7-year objective to balance the budget, which I support. For this year, we would move $17 mil- lion into the underfunded VA medical account. We would also eliminate an unfunded mandate. It is an unfunded mandate, because every university in every jurisdiction that administers a college or student loan program is re- quired to determine whether or not those students have registered for the draft and are currently registered for the draft and whether their address is current. So we have an opportunity to elimi- nate a bureaucracy which has no na- tional security purpose and to save funds. This is a great opportunity for this House to go on record, as the House did 2 years ago for 1 month, until we ceded to the Senate, that this is a bureaucracy whose time has passed. We can save money and remove the burden of draft registration from our young people. Mr. Chairman, patriotism does not come in a postcard, unless you have some bizarre Publisher's Clearing House view of what constitutes patriot- ism and Selective Service. This is the postcard every young man between 18 and 25 must fill out every time they move. It is time to do away with this bu- reaucracy and cede to the economic re- alities. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I do not stand on this floor and protect Federal spending very often. As a matter of fact, in the last several weeks, I have voted to cut projects in my own district because it is so serious that we get this budget balanced. This is an important issue. This is national defense. The Joint Chiefs of Staff oppose this amendment. The Committee on National Security, the committee of jurisdiction, opposes it. The National Security Advisor opposes it. President Clinton opposes it. But let me read a letter, just in case my colleagues do not see through the subterfuge of abolishing this depart- ment and putting the money into vet- erans affairs. The American Legion and the veterans organizations do not want that money put over there. They want the program protected. Mr. Chairman, The American Legion strongly opposes the amendment proposed by P ETER DEFAZIO. The American Legion supports the retention and full funding of the Selective Service registra- tion program as being in the best interests of all Americans. The Selective Service System is a proven, cost-effective, essential and rapid means of reconstituting the required forces to protect our national service. Let me read you the most important part:CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7904 July 27, 1995 Removing this rite of passage for a young man would reduce each man's level of con- sciousness about military service and obliga- tion to defend our country. I want my colleagues to go home this August break. I want them to go into their offices where the recruitment of- fices are right next door and I want my colleagues to ask the recruiters. They are having trouble today getting young men and women to voluntarily serve in our all-voluntary military. Mr. Chairman, these lists are very important tools. We have high schools that will not let recruiters on campus; we have colleges that will not let re- cruiters on campus. These lists are where we get the names to tell these young men and women what an honor- able career it is to serve in the U.S. military in service to their country. Mr. Chairman, that is why we need to preserve this measly $16 million. It is money well spent for the national secu- rity of this country. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SOLOMON. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. DORNAN. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from New York [Mr. S OLO- MON] and I were at the dedication today on the 42d anniversary of the Ko- rean war where Mr. Clinton delivered a beautifully written speech about how important it was to preserve liberty in South Korea. I thought it was equally important to preserve it in South Vietnam, but at the end of the debate, when we are out of the Committee of the Whole, I will put in the whole text of Bill Clinton's letter to the Commander of the ROTC on December 3, 1969. Here is what he says about the draft. He says, The draft was justified in World War II, be- cause the life of the people, collectively, was at stake. Individuals had to fight, if the Na- tion was to survive, for the lives of their countrymen and their way of life. Vietnam is no such case, nor was Korea an example. Clinton had exceptions with Korea in spite of his remarks today, and he cer- tainly had exceptions with Vietnam. But remember, Clinton did register for the draft. His problems came much later. Mr. Chairman, I submit the following article for the R ECORD . TEXT OF BILLCLINTON 'SDECEMBER 3, 1969 LETTER TO ROTC C OLONEL I am sorry to be so long in writing. I know I promised to let you hear from me at least once a month, and from now on you will, but I have had to have some time to think about this first letter. Almost daily since my re- turn to England I have thought about writ- ing, about what I want to and ought to say. First, I want to thank you, not just for saving me from the draft, but for being so kind and decent to me last summer, when I was as low as I have ever been. One thing which made the bond we struck in good faith somewhat palatable to me was my high re- gard for you personally. In retrospect, it seems that the admiration might not have been mutual had you known a little more about me, about my political beliefs and ac- tivities. At least you might have thought me more fit for the draft than for ROTC.Let me try to explain. As you know, I worked for two years in a very minor posi- tion on the Senate Foreign Relations Com- mittee. I did it for the experience and the salary but also for the opportunity, however small, of working every day against a war I opposed and despised with a depth of feeling I had reserved solely for racism in America before Vietnam. I did not take the matter lightly but studied it carefully, and there was a time when not many people had more information about Vietnam at hand than I did. I have written and spoken and marched against the war. One of the national organiz- ers of the Vietnam Moratorium is a close friend of mine. After I left Arkansas last summer, I went to Washington to work in the national headquarters of the Morato- rium, then to England to organize the Amer- icans here for demonstrations Oct. 15 and Nov. 16. Interlocked with the war is the draft issue, which I did not begin to consider separately until early 1968. For a law seminar at Georgetown I wrote a paper on the legal ar- guments for and against allowing, within the Selective Service System, the classification of selective conscientious objection for those opposed to participation in a particular war, not simply to ``participation in war in any form.'' From my work I came to believe that the draft system itself is illegitimate. No gov- ernment really rooted in limited, parliamen- tary democracy should have the power to make its citizens fight and kill and die in a war they may oppose, a war which even pos- sibly may be wrong, a war which, in any case, does not involve immediately the peace and freedom of the nation. The draft was justified in World War II be- cause the life of the people collectively was at stake. Individuals had to fight, if the na- tion was to survive, for the lives of their countrymen and their way of life. Vietnam is no such case. Nor was Korea an example where, in my opinion, certain military ac- tion was justified but the draft was not, for the reasons stated above. Because of my opposition to the draft and the war. I am in great sympathy with those who are not willing to fight, kill and maybe die for their country (i.e. the particular pol- icy of a particular government) right or wrong. Two of my friends at Oxford are con- scientious objectors. I wrote a letter of rec- ommendation for one of them to his Mis- sissippi draft board, a letter which I am more proud of than anything else I wrote at Oxford last year. One of my roommates is a draft re- sister who is possibly under indictment and may never be able to go home again. He is one of the bravest, best men I know. His country needs men like him more than they know. That he is considered a criminal is an obscenity. The decision not to be a resister and the related subsequent decisions were the most difficult of my life. I decided to accept the draft in spite of my beliefs for one reason: to maintain my political viability within the system. For years I have worked to prepare myself for a political life characterized by both practical political ability and concern for rapid social progress. It is a life I still feel compelled to try to lead. I do not think our system of government is by definition corrupt, however dangerous and inadequate it has been in recent years. (The society may be corrupt, but that is not the same thing, and if that is true, we are all finished any- way.) When the draft came, despite political con- victions, I was having a hard time facing the prospect of fighting a war I had been fighting against, and that is why I contacted you. ROTC was the one way left in which I couldpossibly, but not positively, avoid both Viet- nam and resistance. Going on with my edu- cation, even coming back to England, played no part in my decision to join ROTC. I am back here, and would have been at Arkansas Law School because there is nothing else I can do. In fact, I would like to have been able to take a year out perhaps to teach in a small college or work on some community action project and in the process to decide whether to attend law school or graduate school and how to begin putting what I have learned to use. But the particulars of my personal life are not nearly as important to me as the prin- ciples involved. After I signed the ROTC let- ter of intent, I began to wonder whether the compromise I had made with myself was not more objectionable than the draft would have been, because I had no interest in the ROTC program in itself and all I seemed to have done was to protect myself from phys- ical harm. Also, I began to think I had de- ceived you, not by lies\u00d0there were none\u00d0 but by failing to tell you all the things I'm writing now. I doubt that I had the mental coherence to articulate them then. At that time, after we had made our agree- ment and you had sent my 1\u00b1D deferment to my draft board, the anguish and loss of my self-regard and self-confidence really set in. I hardly slept for weeks and kept going by eat- ing compulsively and reading until exhaus- tion brought sleep. Finally, on Sept. 12 I stayed up all night writing a letter to the chairman of my draft board, saying basically what is in the preceding paragraph, thanking him for trying to help in a case where he really couldn't, and stating that I couldn't do the ROTC after all and would he please draft me as soon as possible. I never mailed the letter, but I did carry it on me every day until I got on the plane to return to England. I didn't mail the letter because I didn't see, in the end, how my going in the Army and maybe going to Viet- nam would achieve anything except a feeling that I had punished myself and gotten what I deserved. So I came back to England to try to make something of this second year of my Rhodes scholarship. And that is where I am now, writing to you because you have been good to me and have a right to know what I think and feel. I am writing too in the hope that my telling this one story will help you to understand more clearly how so many fine people have come to find themselves still loving their country but loathing the military, to which you and other good men have devoted years, life- times, of the best service you could give. To many of us, it is no longer clear what is serv- ice and what is disservice, or if it is clear, the conclusion is likely to be illegal. Forgive the length of this letter. There was much to say. There is still a lot to be said, but it can wait. Please say hello to Col. Jones for me. Merry Christmas. Sincerely, BILLCLINTON . Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, I re- serve the balance of my time. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Cali- fornia [Mr. R OHRABACHER ]. Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, practically speaking, the draft and draft registration is a waste of scarce tax dollars, a waste of $17 million this year alone. The draft itself will likely never serve our national security needs, especially in an era of high-tech weapons and computerized weapons systems.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7905 July 27, 1995 That is speaking practically. Speak- ing philosophically, unless war is de- clared, indicating an overwhelming support by the American people, a peacetime draft is totally inconsistent with our national tradition. Many of those who arrived on our shores and built this great land of lib- erty were escaping despotism, the des- potism of their native lands, which more than anything else was signified by the tyranny of conscription. Only during the cold war was a peacetime conscription tolerated in the United States, and even then, after two dec- ades, it was abandoned with the sup- port of Richard Nixon, Barry Gold- water and Ronald Reagan. Mr. Chairman, it is long overdue that we quit wasting money on this anach- ronism which has nothing to do with the security of our country and every- thing to do with egos that are trying to prove a point in an argument that should have ended over 20 years ago. Finally, the American military is a fine example, a shining example, of vol- unteerism. The strength of our country is in its love of liberty and freedom. Our military today represents that love of liberty because they are volun- teers. Liberty will be safe as long as our people who serve this country, the brave men and women who volunteer, are willing to do so. We should honor them by trusting our people, and we will be free as long as they stand strong and we stand behind them. We stand for the principles of liberty and justice and democracy that brought people to these shores 200 years ago at the founding of our coun- try. /ballot2200 Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposi- tion to the amendment of the gen- tleman from Oregon [Mr. D EFAZIO]. The Selective Service System is work- ing well; it is not broke, it does not need fixing. I would say that the sys- tem is an insurance policy against the unknown. We did not know what would happen in the Persian Gulf war. We almost had to go back to the draft because when you have a war, young men and women do not come in and volunteer. We need this system; it is in place. It does not cost a lot of money; it costs less than one Apache helicopter. We have 11,000 volunteers around the coun- try working for the Selective Service. They believe in it. Mr. Chairman, the young men of this country, 98 percent of them, have signed up when their time came. When they have reached 18, they have gone right to the Post Office, they have signed up with the Selective Service System. They like to carry the card; it is a patriotic duty and they appreciate it. So let us vote down the DeFazio amendment and move ahead with other important issues.Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the DeFazio amendment. I support the actions of the full Appropriations Committee to provide $23 million for the Selective Service System for fiscal year 1996. This funding is an inexpensive insurance policy against the unknown. We ought to keep that policy in force. It has the bipartisan support of the House Republican and Democratic leadership, Presi- dent Clinton, and the Department of Defense. It is also backed by all the Nation's military and veterans organizations, as well as the more than 11,000 Selective Service volunteers across America who will make the process work if it is activated. And while this is a relatively small amount of money, decisions regarding the future of this agency should not be budget-driven at all. They should really be considered on national security grounds. Since early in this century, we have always had an organized capability to plan for, and to conduct, a draft in a crisis. It has served us well. Now is not the time to terminate that ca- pability. Registration is a quick and easy process that has always been accepted among our 18 year olds. The compliance rate has been steady at 98 or 99 percent over the years. I believe the young people look upon this as a patriotic duty, and that they would be ready to answer the call, if we faced a national cri- sis. Funding the Selective Service System does not promote a military draft. I don't support a draft. The all-volunteer force has worked, and continues to work in our Nation's defense. But no one can predict when we might have an- other war. If this country were forced into a full-scale crisis, we would need more people than our scaled-down all-volunteer force could provide. We simply would be unable to quickly mobi- lize large numbers of people without the Se- lective Service System. We all hope our country never again faces an national emergency, but we ought to be prepared for such an action. Selective Service provides us that ability. It is efficiently run and its computerized data base can mobilize large numbers of people in a short period of time. If we cut this funding for Selective Service today, it could take a year or more to start up again in a crisis. That might be too late in a national emergency. Can we afford to gamble that our country will never again face a national crisis? I think the answer is no. We have an inexpensive hedge against such a crisis with the Selective Service System. Let's keep it. Oppose the DeFazio amendment. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York [Mr. G ILMAN ]. Mr. GILMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the DeFazio Selective Service amendment. You know, the world is a dangerous place today. We see hot spots all over the world, in a mode of uncertainty for all of us. It is important that we have a ready defense. Mr. Chairman, let me read from the President's May 18, 1994, letter to the Speaker of the House in which he says, I have decided that it is essential to our national security to continue draft registra-tion of the Selective Service system. While tangible military requirements alone do not currently make a mass call-up of American young men likely, there are three reasons I believe we should maintain the Selective Service and the draft registration require- ment. Maintaining that system provides a hedge against unforeseen threats. Terminating this system now can send the wrong signal to our potential enemies. As fewer and fewer members of our society have direct military experience, it is increas- ingly important to maintain the link be- tween the all-volunteer force and our society at large. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in opposition to the DeFazio amendment. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. F OLEY ]. Mr. FOLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to join the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO] and the gentleman from Cali- fornia [Mr. R OHRABACHER ] in offering this amendment to end peacetime draft registration. Mr. Chairman, it pains me to oppose my good friend, the gentleman from New York [Mr. S OLOMON ] on this issue as I consider the gentleman one of the most patriotic Members of this Con- gress. Mr. Chairman, the VA\u00b1HUD appro- priations bill includes $23 million for Selective Service. The Selective Serv- ice, as we know it today, was created by President Carter to respond to fears that regional conflicts of the Soviet Union would grow and lead to a super- power showdown. The national defense structure at that time had been gutted and allowed the volunteer Armed Forces to fall to dangerously low lev- els. No wonder we created a peacetime draft. We could not get Americans to volunteer for service. Mr. Chairman, that is not the case today. This Congress has made a com- mitment to a strong national defense. We intend to keep military personnel equipped and ready to fight. We have over 1 million active duty troops. We have over 1 million trained Select Reservists, and we have almost 800,000 Standby Reservists. We have 3 million volunteers, young men and women ready to give their lives in de- fense of America's freedom. In almost 10 years of the Vietnam war, just under 2.5 million Americans were sent to the combat area; one of every four of those young Americans were drafted. In 10 years we did not send the number of volunteers that can be deployed from our shores today. Mr. Chairman, I use this example to show that the amendment will not leave the U.S. defense vulnerable. We have 3 million volunteers ready to fight. By cutting $17 million, this amendment leaves $6 million to keep an on-the-shelf system that would in a short period of time be able to augment the volunteer Armed Forces. The $17 million will be transferred to add to the veterans' medical care. Mr. Chairman, let me sum this up. This amendment is prodefense becauseCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7906 July 27, 1995 instead of feeding a useless bureauc- racy, it adds funding to care for the men and women who have defended our liberty. I ask, which is better, to create a strong fighting force or a bloated Federal bureaucracy? Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for the Nation's veterans, vote yes on this amendment. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. DE LA GARZA ], a World War II veteran, and both of his sons served in the Persian Gulf war. I am pleased to yield to him. Mr. DE LA GARZA. I thank the gen- tleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I want to bring an- other perspective to this debate. One is that I served in the Navy at the end of World War II and then I served during the Korean war. I was in the Reserves in between. One of the regrets of my life is that I never got to register for the draft. Mr. Chairman, the perspective in my area, though, is we have high schools waiting for ROTC, we have colleges waiting for ROTC. Registering raises the consciousness of our youth, and I think that it is a pride. Mr. Chairman, I know that there is a technical aspect to it to have to enlist and to be prepared, but it adds to our young people's consciousness that we have a country, that we have fought wars, and that there may be the possi- bility of other wars. I think that the money is very little for the effort that is done mostly by volunteers, but I think the young peo- ple deserve the opportunity to show that they want to serve their country. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 11\u00a42minutes to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. M ETCALF ]. Mr. METCALF. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong sup- port of the DeFazio amendment. It transfers $17 million from the Selective Service account to the VA medical care account. The opposition to this amendment argues that the Selective Service is a visible symbol of national security, a symbol that we need to protect. Well, $23 million is an awfully expensive symbol. The Department of Defense has stated, and I quote, ``Peacetime draft registration could be suspended with no effect on military mobilization requirements.'' I will repeat that. The Department of Defense: ``Peacetime draft registration could be suspended with no effect on military mobilization requirements.'' Mr. Chairman, the Pentagon goes on the say that with over 1 million trained members in Select Reserve units, plus another 750,000 individual Ready Reserve personnel, we already have the ability to augment active forces through the early days of a major conflict. If we want a real symbol of patriot- ism, let us honor those veterans whohave made the sacrifice for our Nation. Let us show veterans who have made the ultimate offering that this country has not forgotten them. Mr. Chairman, we just dedicated a memorial to our veterans of the Ko- rean war, showing our praise and thanks to American servicemen. We must not let them think that in just a matter of hours, we have forgotten the sacrifices they made. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment to help VA medical and vote for those veterans to whom we owe so much. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York [Mr. N ADLER ]. (Mr. NADLER asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, we have lost sight of first principles. This coun- try was founded on the spirit of liberty, that what we give to our country, we give voluntarily. The Peace Corps voluntary service is voluntary. The draft is not in the spirit of American liberty. It was a conces- sion, a concession to danger and to re- ality. For most of American history, we did not have it, and then we blessed ourselves as different from the tyr- annies of Europe that had it. Mr. Chairman, for the last 50 years of war, hot and cold, we had to have it, of necessity. But now we do not. We have 2 million men and women under arms, as much as the rest of the planet com- bined. We would have plenty of time to prepare and to reinstitute a draft if some other nation began arming to match us with supposed danger. There is no danger that justifies this depar- ture from our traditions of liberty. Mr. Chairman, let us remember what this country is about. A draft, a Selec- tive Service System is obnoxious to the spirit of liberty and ought not to be maintained except as a concession of danger which does not now exist. So I support the amendment. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I am going to reserve the balance of my time to close. I believe I have 1 minute. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Chairman, I would like to yield 1 minute to the gen- tleman from Tennessee [Mr. T ANNER ], a Vietnam hero veteran. Mr. TANNER. I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I spoke yesterday on the floor on what I thought was a short-sighted amendment. But may I say to my friends, and I understand the arguments on the other side, but I would say in this new world order, this is probably one of the most short-sight- ed amendments we could adopt, and I say that for this reason: None of us can see the future. All of us know, realize, and understand that one of our roles as the United States of America today is as the leader of the free world. The least we can ask of our citizens, our young people in this country is to register. Most of our NATO allies have compulsory service. We ask only forregistration. Mr. Chairman, I say to my friends, that is not too great a price to pay for our liberty. I would hope that we would reject this amendment out of hand. I used to serve in the Selective Service; we would have a ready pool if something untoward happens in this world. None of us can see the future, and I hope we reject this ill-timed amendment. Mr. MONTGOMERY. Mr. Chairman, I yield my last minute to the gentleman from Washington [Mr. D ICKS], a great patriot and a great American. (Mr. DICKS asked and was given per- mission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. DICKS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the position of the gen- tleman from Mississippi [Mr. M ONT- GOMERY ] on this issue, because I believe that having a Selective Service System in place maintains American readiness, and that is the crucial issue. If we do not have a Selective Service System in place, we would have to reconstitute it, if we had to go to a draft, and it would take a long period of time to do that, at least 2 years. So I would tell the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. D EFAZIO] that all those veterans that we all support in terms of health care would much prefer the country being prepared, keeping this tool in place. What is the compliance rate? Ninety- nine percent of our young people have been willing to register without any objection. So this is a good tool, a good mechanism, and I think it keeps our country prepared. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the outstanding gentleman from New York City [Mr. F LAKE ], a longstanding member of this body. (Mr. FLAKE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. FLAKE. Mr. Chairman, I realize that some would consider this to be a peculiar time and a peculiar moment for me to be standing on the Floor. One of the things I have done is, I have ana- lyzed the problems that have developed in this Nation. For the African-Amer- ican community in particular, I would suggest that one of the worst calami- ties ever to happen was the elimination of the draft. Mr. Chairman, I am a civil libertar- ian. But I also understand one thing, that when African-American young men can be taken off street corners, put into a disciplined environment, be able to leave their corner and under- stand there is a bigger world for them; when they come back they have a sense of discipline, they have an understand- ing of what it means to be able to make a contribution not only to their own lives, but to the lives of others. /ballot2215 They learned discipline. They learned what it meant to be able to take care of their responsibilities, and they got two major benefits: They had an edu- cational benefit so that they could getCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7907 July 27, 1995 an education; and they had an oppor- tunity to purchase their first asset, which was a home. Mr. Chairman, I believe tonight when we talk about eliminating the Selec- tive Service System, one of the prob- lems I have is when we spend so much money building jails, we ought to con- sider that we ought to do more to put these young people in a situation where they could do something posi- tive. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 30 sec- onds. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, let me just say to my good friend, the gen- tleman from New York, Mr. F LOYD FLAKE , amen, amen, amen. Yes, they do. They learn a little pride, they learn a little patriotism, they learn how not to use drugs, they even get a little reli- gion. Is that not wonderful for this country? Please vote against the DeFazio amendment. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 11\u00a44min- utes. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, we are getting a little afield here. This is not about reinstating the draft. We are not about that. The military does not want it. In fact, the Department of Defense has said peacetime draft registration, not conscription, could be suspended with no effect on military mobilization requirements. Ronald Reagan said, ``I believe this proposal, draft registration, is an ill- conceived one and should be rejected. Advance registration will do little to enhance our military preparedness.'' That was from Ronald Reagan and the Department of Defense. If this is what we think brings patri- otism and citizenship to our kids, not good schools, not decent housing, and all the other things we are eliminating here on the floor, this is an oppor- tunity to eliminate an obsolete Federal bureaucracy and put in place a standby system which uses modern computer technology, if indeed a calamity ever comes, and if indeed we ever have to go back to conscription, which I do not believe we will, but we will have that as a standby system. This is 1940's technology. This is not citizenship, except in some bizarre Publisher's Clearinghouse view of the world where you send in a postcard every time you move. That is not teaching our young people the values that we need to instill. Mrs. VUCANOVICH. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment to eliminate the Selective Service System. The sponsor says that his amendment does not terminate the program, but puts it on standby. To me, this effectively terminates the program. How do you put an organization which has a standby function for our armed forces on standby? You don't and you can't\u00d0because itdestroys the very concept of readiness. If we should require a draft, how would you select people to serve? Would you choose those who are tall? Would you choose those with red hair? No, you would have a fair and equi- table system to determine who would volun- teer, and that system takes a great deal of time to develop and maintain. Unfortunately, we have not achieved the goal of world peace. Chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons have created a dangerous atmosphere of conflict and potential for cas- ualties for which DOD may not be prepared. As such, DOD officials recommend the draft as a way to meet such challenges by ensuring a high quality and quantity volunteer force. Simply put, the DeFazio amendment puts our Nation and our freedom at risk. I urge a no vote on the amendment. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . WELDON OF FLOR - IDA TO THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . DE FAZIO Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I offer an amendment to the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. W ELDON of Florida to the amendment offered by Mr. DEFAZIO: Strike the first paragraph and in- sert the following: Page 12, line 2, strike ``$183,435,000,'' and in- sert ``$195,455,000,''. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I reserve a point of order on the amendment. The CHAIRMAN. All time has ex- pired for debate. Does the gentleman from California insist on his point of order? Mr. LEWIS of California. Is the chairman telling me the gentleman has no time on his amendment to the amendment? The CHAIRMAN. The time was lim- ited under the unanimous consent agreement to the amendment and all amendments thereto. All time for de- bate has expired. Mr. SOLOMON. Mr. Chairman, we do not know what the gentleman's amend- ment does. I think the membership ought to know, in case we want to argue for or against the point of order. The gentleman ought to have a chance to explain. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con- sent that the gentleman from Florida, Mr. W ELDON , be given two minutes to explain his amendment. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York? There was no objection. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, reserv- ing the right to object, I simply would inquire if the gentleman gets unani- mous consent for 2 minutes to offer his amendment, does anybody get a minute or two in case they want to comment or oppose it? The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from New York [Mr. S OLOMON ] pro- pounded a unanimous consent request. Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I with- draw my reservation of objection. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from New York?There was no objection. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Florida [Mr. W ELDON ] is recog- nized for 2 minutes. Mr. WELDON of Florida. Mr. Chair- man, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, the intent of my amendment was very simple. Although many areas of the country have ade- quate medical facilities for veterans, some areas do not. My amendment sim- ply would shift the money to the VA construction account instead of the general medical account as the gen- tleman from Oregon [Mr. D EFAZIO] has proposed. Simply put, my amendment would direct these funds to the most needy veterans, the veterans who cur- rently have no medical facilities. As a veteran and as a physician who has provided medical care to many of these veterans, I understand the acute need for the underserved communities. Today there are 250,000 veterans living in east-central Florida that are in great need of a veterans medical facil- ity. Without the adoption of my amendment to the amendment, these 250,000 veterans, who gave of them- selves for our freedom, and other veter- ans in underserved areas, will see little improvement in their veteran-scare. The veterans in these areas are the most underserved in the Nation, and we have a responsibility to fulfill our commitments to them. If we are going to transfer money from the Selective Service to meet the needs of veterans, we should transfer it to serve the most needy veterans. Voting for the Weldon amendment will do this. Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, there is a point of order for lack of ger- maneness against my amendment, so I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment at this time. I appre- ciate the chairman's recognition. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Florida? There was no objection. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Oregon [Mr. D EFAZIO]. The question was taken; and the Chairman announced that the noes ap- peared to have it. Mr. D EFAZIO. Mr. Chairman, I de- mand a recorded vote. The CHAIRMAN. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, further proceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO] will be postponed. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I had intended to offer an amendment, but pending a colloquy with the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS], I will withhold on that amendment. Mr. Chairman, what the amendment was about was adding $429,000 to the Court of Veterans Appeals. The $429,000 was cut by the committee from the 1995 appropriation level. According to the Chief Justice of the Court of VeteransCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7908 July 27, 1995 Appeals, this cut will kill the pro bono legal program for low income veterans, as well as further delay hearings and timely decisions on all claims appealed to the court. I would like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] about his intentions re- garding the sum of money. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. SANDERS. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I very much appreciate my col- league cooperating, with the time dif- ficulties we have as well as the problem the gentleman is attempting to draw our attention to. Frankly, the amount of money the gentleman is talking about is a very small amount of money in this entire picture. I am personally willing to commit to the gentleman that I will work very hard in conference to try to restore that money, and bring it to the attention of the appropriate members of the Senate side as well. Mr. SANDERS. Mr. Chairman, re- claiming my time, does the gentleman think we have a good chance to capture this money? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will continue to yield, out of all the money we are talk- ing about here, that is almost a drop in the pond. I would be surprised if we could not satisfy the gentleman. Mr. MINGE. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. (Mr. MINGE asked and was given per- mission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. MINGE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in opposition to language appearing at page 56 of the report for this appropriations bill. The language in question attempts to influence the Environmental Protection Agency's [EPA] im- plementation of the Reformulated Gasoline Program [RFG]. This language tells the EPA that it should refrain from spending any funds on the pursuit of creating a market share for specific oxygenates. This is unfortunate; it is vital that the EPA has the flexibility to deal with renewable fuels in reformulated gasoline in the manner which the EPA feels is most productive. The tragedy of the situation is that the pe- troleum industry and this report disregard the importance of renewable fuels and attempt to dissuade the EPA from acting responsibly. In fact, recent technological developments and a range of economic, environmental, and na- tional security externalities have an important bearing on the value of using oxygenates which are derived from a domestically pro- duced source. Every school child knows that there is a very limited supply of easily obtain- able fossil fuel. Therefore, developing renew- able fuels is vital. Corn-based ethanol has be- come more abundant; the engineering needed for cost-effective development is emerging. It is a win-win situation when the balance of payments, the environment, the agricultural economy, rural economic development, and reduced dependence on energy from distant, politically volatile sources of petroleum supply can all be promoted at one time.Unfortunately, most of these factors are not valued in today's market. Nonetheless, there are vast costs which we are absorbing in the form of tax dollars and societal costs. Report language from an appropriations subcommittee is not the appropriate place to make critical decisions about renewable fuels. Such decisions deserve public input and the attention of the entire House of Representa- tives. Certainly, the EPA should have the abil- ity to pursue a fair role for renewable fuels in the reformulated gasoline program. This can- not be influenced by obscure, staff-prepared language in a report accompanying an appro- priations bill. The CHAIRMAN. Are there other amendments to title III? AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . DAVIS Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment, No. 1. The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will des- ignate the amendment. The text of the amendment is as fol- lows: Amendment offered by Mr. D AVIS: Page 87, after line 25, insert the following new sec- tion: SEC. 519. (a) C ONTRACTOR CONVERSION .\u00d0The Administrator of the Environmental Protec- tion Agency shall cease any further hiring in the Agency's Office of Research and Develop- ment, and shall maintain the funding of all existing scientific and technical support con- tracts at not less than the current level. (b) R EPORT .\u00d0Not later than January 1, 1996, the head of the Office of Research and Development of the Environmental Protec- tion Agency shall submit to the Congress a report on all staffing plans including the use of Federal and contract employees. Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires that the adminis- trator of EPA cease all further hiring in the agency's Office of Research and Development [ORD] for the purposes of the contractor conversion initiative as laid out in last year's VA/HUD Appro- priations bill. This amendment is necessary to pre- vent EPA from further eroding the em- ployment base of four well respected private sector companies who have been providing contract support to EPA's office of research and develop- ment. Last year, Congress provided EPA with resources and direction in the fis- cal year 1995 VA/HUD appropriations bill to improve the agency's contracts management. Unfortunately, the Office of Research and Development has mis- handled the resources provided to it and ignored the direction of Congress. My amendment serves to soften the blow to those private sector companies providing contract support. In fiscal year 1995 EPA received an increase in its authorized personnel ceilings by 900 positions. Of that num- ber, 265 positions were provided to the Office of Research and Development. This increase runs contrary to the ad- ministration effort as well as this Con- gress' efforts to reduce the size of Gov- ernment and has not addressed the weaknesses in EPA contracts manage- ment as it was intended to do. These weaknesses were identified by the Con- gress and the EPA inspector general.Of the 265 positions allotted to ORD, only 32 were directed to address the identified contracts management prob- lems. The remaining 233 positions have been used to augment the ORD workforce in four Government labs. During this time, ORD has undergone an internal reorganization by merging these labs into four ``mega-labs''. The 233 positions were directed to the mega labs under the leadership of an EPA employee. This individual had the sole responsibility for coordinating the con- tractor conversion activities at EPA and they have used their authority to raid EPA's private contractors. The situation as it stands now is that four well respected private professional service contractors have lost signifi- cant business and stand to lose even more if we do not halt ORD's actions. The result has not been improved con- tacts management or reduced costs for the Government, it has been bigger bu- reaucracy. This amendment stops this grievous action. Of the companies raided by EPA, one is a small business and another is mi- nority owned. In the case of the minor- ity owned firm, after 10 years of hard work building a successful business, the firm saw 75 percent of its total workforce hired away by EPA. In the case of the small business, it lost 22 of its 33 employees to the agency's ac- tions. This is a prime example of the big Government that so many of us were elected to stop. This amendments puts a hold on any further hiring in EPA's Office of Re- search and Development for the pur- poses of carrying out the contractor conversion efforts required under the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act of 1994. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and support America's small and minority businesses by put- ting an end to EPA's actions. Mr. MORAN. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. DAVIS. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia. Mr. MORAN. Mr. Chairman, does the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. D AVIS] want to amend his language? Mr. DAVIS. I believe the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] has an amendment. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the bal- ance of my time. AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . LEWIS OF CALI - FORNIA TO THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MR . DAVIS Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I offer an amendment to the amendment. The Clerk read as follows: Amendment offered by Mr. L EWIS of Cali- fornia to the amendment offered by Mr. DAVIS: In subsection (a) of the amendment strike the words ``and shall maintain the funding of all existing scientific and technical support contracts at not less than the current level''.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7909 July 27, 1995 Mr. LEWIS of California (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unani- mous consent that the amendment to the amendment be considered as read and printed in the R ECORD . The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. /ballot2330 Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, reserv- ing the right to object, I do not know what the second amendment is. Continuing my reservation of objec- tion, I yield to the gentleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] to find out what this amendment is. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, my amendment strikes the sec- ond part of the first paragraph, the words ``and shall maintain the funding of all existing scientific and technical support contracts at not less than the current level.'' I do not think the chairman would have any problem with that. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, as I understand what the gentleman is doing, he is leaving only the first part of the amendment and striking the sec- ond part of the amendment and, in striking the second part, he is striking the part which freezes existing con- tracts; is that correct? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, if the gentleman will continue to yield, the gentleman is correct. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I with- draw my reservation of objection. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. D AVIS]. Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Chairman, I would be pleased to accept the perfecting amendment. I think this amendment clarifies the original intent of my amendment which is to put a stop to EPA's practice of hiring away employ- ees from their contractors. The language the gentleman strikes from my amendment was intended to ensure that EPA does not take retribu- tion against these same contractors who have been harmed by EPA's inap- propriate actions. I would, therefore, like to get the gentleman's assurances, that if EPA does take punitive action against three contractors, the gen- tleman would be willing to revisit this issue. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I assure the gentleman that I would be greatly disturbed if EPA takes any action that could be con- strued as retribution against these con- tractors. Mr. DAVIS. Mr. Chairman, if the gen- tleman will continue to yield, I will happy to accept the amendment. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. C LINGER ].Mr. CLINGER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the Davis-Moran amend- ment to the VA, HUD and independent agencies appropriations bill. The amendment would freeze internal hir- ing in EPA's Office of Research and De- velopment in the hope that current contracting levels would be main- tained. It might be useful to provide a bit of background because this amendment is in direct response to actions taken by the agency regarding the implementa- tion of its contractor conversion initia- tive. In fiscal year 1995 EPA requested an additional 900 FTE's and $44.6 mil- lion for its contractor conversion ini- tiative and received appropriations to start the initiative. This budget re- quest was initially prompted by criti- cism about EPA's use of contractors, especially with regard to some contrac- tor abuses. I have listened to endless testimony concerning contractor reim- bursement of Rolex watches and rein- deer suits. No one here believes that taxpayers should be footing the bill for these items. However, it has never been clear to me that the way to ameliorate the problem is to hire more EPA em- ployees. In a time when we are looking to downside the government, we have EPA hiring up. In a time when we are looking to rely more on the private sector, we have EPA relying less on the private sector. This doesn't make a whole lot of sense just because we have accountability problems with a few bad apple contractors. Now we are not hearing from private contractors that EPA is offering their employees full time government jobs and shutting down their companies. Many of the positions being filled by EPA don't even fit the definition of in- herently governmental positions which were the positions of most concern. In a letter from EPA, the agency indi- cated that contractor size and perform- ance were not factors in the decision- making process, and in addition admit- ted that the initiative has indeed nega- tively impacted some small and minor- ity-owned businesses and that only 26 of the 265 positions being filled by ORD were inherently governmental. Given this information, it leads one to ask\u00d0what are we doing? Is this just a quick fix to address some contracting abuses and get Congress off our backs? I urge my colleagues to support the Davis-Moran amendment and provide EPA a time out to re-examine this con- version initiative. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I compliment the gentleman. If this bill goes forward in a reasonable fashion and becomes law, I would guess it would be time out for awhile. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I would like to sug- gest that we inform the Members on what is happening here, because I am concerned that some Members mayhave gotten the impression that there will not be votes yet tonight and unless something else happens there will be. So we need to get this tied down. I wonder if we can do that before we have lots of Members on both sides of the aisle in massive confusion. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield? Mr. OBEY. I yield to the gentleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I hate to do this in the middle of somebody's vote on an amendment. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I would be happy to stop if we can get an under- standing that as soon as the discussion on this amendment is completed, we will immediately inform all Members about what is going to happen for the rest of the evening. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I will attempt to do so. At this moment I would urge Members not to presume there are no more votes to- night. We are attempting to get to that point, however. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. (Mr. DINGELL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his re- marks.) Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to the author of the amendment, I want this committee to know what is going on here. EPA has a long history of having used contractors. Very frankly, the contractors are a sorry lot. The Sub- committee on Oversight and Investiga- tions last year investigated them. I want you to hear what the contractors did with the taxpayers money, the money that we are charged with pro- tecting. Frankly, this amendment should be called the Corrupt Contractor Protec- tion Act of 1995. It tells EPA that it cannot save money. In fact, it tells in its original form that EPA must spend money on contractors in the office of research and development. First of all, we found that the con- tractors were cooking the research. We found that they were playing games po- litically in support of the Clean Air Act and Clean Air Act in its strongest and, I think, particularly unacceptable form to my colleagues on this side of the aisle. Now, the contractors, it should be known, enjoyed a very good living at the expense of the taxpayers. They charged the taxpayers with reindeer suits, with clown suits, with Santa Claus costumes. These were all charged to the taxpayers. They charged the taxpayers for golf outings and golf balls. They charged the taxpayers for chocolate bars with the contractor's logo on them. They bought lots and lots of alcohol. They had lots and lots of parties. They had entertainment of all sorts. They spent money on tickets for Johnnie Limbo and the Lug Nuts. They used the taxpayers' money to finance trips by an assortment of persons to Alaska on fishing junkets.CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7910 July 27, 1995 The money which was spent by the contractors was spent under not only improper circumstances but most curi- ous circumstances, because in many in- stances they were charged by the former EPA with the responsibility of opening the mail, of negotiating con- tracts, which they negotiated with themselves. In many instances they paid themselves for work which was not done. They kept records which were in- capable of being audited. They threw Christmas parties. They did work under contracts which never existed and paid themselves lavishly for the privilege. Now, this amendment in its original form would sanctify that kind of be- havior. It would permit those scoun- drels who had been doing those things that we are supposed to be cleaning out of the public purse to do the same thing which they had done before under the same conditions. I do not believe that this House wants to have that kind of situation. I commend the gentleman from Vir- ginia for striking the language which would keep these scoundrels hooked up to the public teat. But I do want you to understand one thing, that to foreclose EPA from the privilege of firing them is bad, but to now not allow EPA to retain enough people on its own payroll to see to it that the public work is properly done is enormously unwise. Let me remind you that the work which is involved here is work which involves research on important ques- tions like air pollution, like whether or not your constituents are violating the air pollution laws or whether what the consequences of a particular Superfund dump might happen to be. I think those are important ques- tions. And we are entitled to have the utmost integrity, truthfulness and ability brought to bear on those kinds of questions. To allow contractors who can come in here and impose upon Members of this body who know noth- ing about the history of contractor misbehavior is wrong. To permit them to continue to prosper at the taxpayers expense on the kind of sorry, shoddy record of serious misbehavior which should have sent the whole lot of them to jail is, I think, extremely unwise and improper on the part of this body in which we are a part. PREFERENTIAL MOTION OFFERED BY MR . DINGELL Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I offer a preferential motion. The Clerk read as follows: Mr. D INGELL moves the Committee do now rise and report the bill back with the enact- ing clause stricken. The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Michigan [Mr. D INGELL ] is recog- nized for 5 minutes. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I want my colleagues to understand. At issue here is not whether we like contractors or whether we have got them in our districts. It is not whether or not welike government or do not like govern- ment. The question is really whether we are going to write law which is in the broad public interest. The question is also whether or not we are going to see to it that corrupt practices in gov- ernment contracting, investigated by congressional committees and docu- ment under oath before those congres- sional committees, are properly re- spected by this body and that the rec- ommendations are properly carried out. By driving the money changers from the temple and by seeing to it that EPA can properly administer its affairs. Those are the questions. Frankly, the amendment, as originally drawn, should be rejected. Very frankly, the amendment as it was amended, and I fought to oppose it, because it is better than what was there. And I am sure my colleagues on this side are going to vote for it in spite of the fact that it is unwise to do so. It is a hard and unfor- tunate fact, my colleagues, that what is at foot here is just that a bunch of contractors do not like getting shoved away from the public trough. They wanted to stay there and keep on doing the same things which they have done in times past, paying themselves for work not done, doing work without contracts, claiming that there were contracts where in fact none exist, showering upon themselves and their friends the joys of being unsupervised in the expenditure of public moneys, hiring Johnnie Limbo and the Lug Nuts, buying lots of alcohol, dressing in reindeer suits, and pretending to do something of value. Now, just one little story. When we were working one night late trying to come together between the House and the Senate with my Republican col- leagues and my Democratic colleagues alike, we tried to get some of these contractors to provide the information that we needed on a very important question; namely, the question affect- ing the implementation of the clean air sections of the law. Members should know that we could not find any of them, and we could not get any co- operation. We finally got information which was carefully cooked, carefully cooked to suit the environmentalists an to write legislation which made it much harder for American industry and American workmen, American business and the American economy. I want Members to understand what happens when these sly, slick, sneaky contractors come in here and they want the Congress to give them special relief. Congress ought not give them special relief. They do not deserve it. As a matter of fact, what they deserve is a comfortable period of time in an appro- priate Federal institution during which they might think of the wrongs which they have done to the taxpaying public of the United States. The amendment is a bad one, even as amended. I urge Members to support the amendment as amended. And ifthey really want to do some good, I urge them to vote against the whole darn thing. /ballot2245 The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the preferential motion offered by the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. D IN- GELL ]. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the motion be withdrawn. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Michigan? There was no objection. Mr. HOYER. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word. Mr. Chairman, I unfortunately did not know this debate was going to occur, but I rise in support of the gen- tleman from Virginia and his amend- ment, as amended or not. I have a great respect for and am a very close friend and ally of the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. D INGELL ]. The gen- tleman from Michigan has done a great deal of good in ensuring that people who do business with the Federal Gov- ernment do not in fact defraud the tax- payers of our country, or in fact do not do jobs for which they contract, or do not in any way abuse their responsibil- ities. Having said that, Mr. Chairman, the situation to which the gentleman's amendment refers is perverse in the ex- treme, in my opinion. That is that we ask people to contract with the Federal Government, put together their cap- ital, place that capital at risk, hire em- ployees, and undertake an objective that the Federal Government wants ac- complished, and contracts towards that end. Then it has turned around in one of the most perverse ways that I have seen and in fact said, ``We are going to cancel your contract for the conven- ience of the Government, and guess what? We are going to take all the em- ployees that you recruited, that you paid money to train, that you put on your payroll, and accrue them to our- selves, and you are out of business.'' Mr. Chairman, I do not take a back seat to anybody on this floor, not one, in the defense of Federal employees. On the other hand, I do not take a back seat to anybody in saying that we ought to side with Federal employees against private sector employees. This is a partnership, not a competition, not where we want to choose one side over the other. What we want to do is en- sure a compatible, fair, and just envi- ronment for both of those groups to ef- fectively perform their duties. Mr. Chairman, I believe this amend- ment speaks to a very serious problem, and it is not the problem that the gen- tleman from Michigan [Mr. D INGELL ] speaks to. The gentleman from Michi- gan has been, as I said earlier, one of the great champions of ensuring against fraud of the taxpayer and of our Government. Are there those out there who would do that? There are. Does the AmericanCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7911 July 27, 1995 taxpayer in this country need a vigor- ous and tough and hard-as-nail watch- dog? It does, and the gentleman from Michigan, J OHNDINGELL , fills that bill. One the other hand, Mr. Chairman, in pursuing that objective to undermine businesspeople who are doing a fair and honest job is wrong. That is what the gentleman from Virginia seeks to ad- dress. I applaud his efforts and support them. Mr. MORAN. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words. Mr. Chairman, I have been working for 9 months to correct an injustice that was done as a result of this appro- priations bill that was passed last year. I have been trying to find out what the source of the problem was, and it be- came apparent tonight who is respon- sible for it, but I am glad I had an op- portunity to hear from my very distin- guished chairman and colleague, the gentleman from Michigan, on what mo- tivated him to do this, because I do not disagree with any of the points that the gentleman from Michigan made. I had an amendment that I offered before the Committee on Rules, it was not made in order, that went much fur- ther than this particular amendment. I suspect that the gentleman from Michigan would have gotten much more excited had it been made in order. However, it is the gentleman from Michigan who should be making this amendment. Let me explain why. Last year this appropriations bill provided 265 positions to correct just the very contract management prob- lems that my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan, identified through his oversight Committee on Energy and Commerce. That was the purpose of those positions, hard-fought-for posi- tions; unprecedented to give an agency in a time of reinventing government 265 more positions. Do Members know what the Environ- mental Protection Agency did once they got those 265 positions? Obvi- ously, they had the same big smile that is on the face of my colleague, the gen- tleman from Michigan, tonight, be- cause they sent out a guidance memo internally within EPA that said, ``These positions are not to be used to correct contract management perform- ance problems.'' Had they been used for the purpose for which they were appropriated, this amendment would not be necessary and there would not have been any injus- tice done, but they were not. What hap- pened is that EPA went out after four small contractors and they raided them. Listen to this, now. One of those was a minority contrac- tor for 10 years. They had put their company together. They went in and bought out 75 percent of his employees. Another one that served EPA for 20 years had gotten a top quality award just last year. In September they had their contract renewed for another year. The appropriations bill passed in October. EPA went immediately tothose employees, after the contract had been renewed, took their private pay stub, and converted it to a Federal paycheck. They hired all but 12 of this contractor's people. They had received a quality award. They were not guilty of any of these problems, but they went in and hired them. This company had been worth $50 million, and it is vir- tually worthless today. Imagine if you were that small business employer, and the Federal Government had come in and raided your employees? There is one individual in EPA, and I think this probably best explains why EPA went about this the way they did. He had a small office. He was respon- sible for monitoring these contracts. He now has 160 people reporting to him, and they are people that were working in the private sector who had been con- verted: scientists, engineers; not man- agement people, not the people that the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. D IN- GELL ] was after. They were scientists and engineers that had been gathered to perform a specific function, and EPA went in and bought them out, telling them that they had no choice. Mr. Chairman, he told them they had no choice, they would lose their jobs if they did not become Federal employ- ees. At a time when we are trying to reinvent government, we have the Fed- eral Government going in, raiding four firms, four small contractors, all of them with top performance ratings, and that is how they used the 265 peo- ple. There was a gross injustice, it was a perversion of what was intended, and it should be overturned by supporting this amendment. The CHAIRMAN. The question is on the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from California [Mr. L EWIS] to the amendment offered by the gen- tleman from Virginia [Mr. D AVIS]. The amendment to the amendment was agreed to. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. D AVIS], as amended. The amendment, as amended, was agreed to. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I move to strike the last word, and to enter into a discussion, a col- loquy, some people say, but a personal conversation with my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ]. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Ohio, and I have been endeavoring to try to put on some reasonable debate on a variety and mix of amendments in order that we could accomplish a cou- ple of things; originally to get us out of here by 10 o'clock tonight, and that was very successful; but also to have the Members help us realize that the more we can restrain ourselves tomor- row, the more likely it is, even if we should come in at 9 o'clock tomorrow, that we will be able to get out of here by 3 o'clock in the afternoon. I thought that we were going toward limiting a certain number of amendments that would give us an assurance of beingout. I think instead now we are going to ask for some time limitations. I know full well we will be coming back in with a full plate in the morning and encouraging the Members to restrain themselves then. Otherwise, while I will be urging that the Speaker and others limit 1-minutes in the morning very severely, I would further be suggesting that we might have to work late into the evening, for we do intend to finish this bill tomor- row. It is not necessary that we go be- yond 3 o'clock, but there is a tendency for us to multiply amendments when we take 12 hours to think about them. With that, Mr. Chairman, the gen- tleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] and I have discussed this between ourselves and with friends. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous con- sent that each of the following amend- ments and any amendments thereto be debatable for the time specified, equal- ly divided and controlled by the pro- ponent and opponent of an individual amendment: The first is amendment No. 48 offered by the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. K ENNEDY ], for 20 minutes, 10 minutes on each side; the second is the amendment No. 26 offered by the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. VENTO ], for 20 minutes; and in all these cases, it is divided equally on each side; third, amendment No. 57 offered by the gentleman form Indiana [Mr. R OEMER ], for 50 minutes; fourth, amendment No. 66 offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. S TOKES ] or the gentleman from New York [Mr. B OEHLERT ], for 90 min- utes; fifth, amendment No. 55 or 56 of- fered by the gentleman from Rhode Is- land [Mr. R EED] or the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. P ALLONE ], for 20 min- utes; sixth, amendment No. 7 offered by the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. D UR- BIN] or the gentleman from Texas [Mr. WILSON ], for 40 minutes. There is no particular order, but nonetheless, those would be the amendments being consid- ered, and it does not limit other possi- bilities of amendments. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman yield? Mr. LEWIS of California. I yield to the gentleman from Ohio. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, that is right. So we have a complete under- standing, these are the amendments upon which we have a time limit, is that correct? Mr. LEWIS of California. I would say to the gentleman, that is right. Mr. STOKES. We do not go further than that. The gentleman has already stated that the manner in which he read the agreed-to amendments will be in no prescribed order? Mr. LEWIS of California. That is cor- rect, Mr. Chairman. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, that meets our agreement. Mr. DINGELL. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Chairman, and I do not think I will, I did not hear some of the other amendments raised. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentleman yield?CONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7912 July 27, 1995 Mr. DINGELL. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I would say to the gentleman, that is because we are doing nothing with the other amendments. They are printed in the R ECORD , they are subject to discussion, and we will be talking about those with the gentleman in the morning. It is an open rule. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, will the gentleman forgive me about being sensitive? Mr. LEWIS of California. I have learned very much from the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. DINGELL. Mr. Chairman, I feel my amendment might just get lost in the shuffle, but I am sure the gen- tleman will want to assure me that the amendment I want to offer on the Superfund will not be foreclosed. Mr. LEWIS of California. It will not be foreclosed, and certainly the last person I want to get lost in the woods or the shuffle is the gentleman from Michigan. Mr. DINGELL. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman, and I withdraw my reserva- tion of objection. Ms. KAPTUR. Reserving the right to object, Mr. Chairman, I doubt that I will object, but I did want to ask the chairman, at what point will our amendment No. 2, the one that was rolled until tomorrow morning con- cerning drug elimination, at what time in the proceedings might that come up tomorrow, please, in view of these re- cently announced time limits? Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. KAPTUR. I yield to the gen- tleman from California. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, we have actually not talked that through, but I can tell the gentle- woman that it would be my intention to have us in a circumstance where there are no more than four amend- ments, that were being packaged to- gether, and the gentlewoman's would be among the early package, so some- time shortly after we get moving in the morning. I am informed it is up the dis- cretion of the Chair, but if the gentle- woman would be some indication as to what she would prefer, I certainly would work toward that end. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. KAPTUR. Further reserving the right to object, I yield to the gen- tleman from Wisconsin. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I think it should also be pointed out in this con- versation that because it is apparently the understanding that there will be no votes before 10, that that may affect in some way the number of votes that do occur at one time. Mr. LEWIS of California. I could. Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, will the gentlewoman yield? Ms. KAPTUR. Further reserving the right to object, I yield to the gen- tleman from Ohio./ballot2300 Mr. STOKES. Mr. Chairman, just one additional question. In our early discussions, I had men- tioned to you the amendment proposed by the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. FIELDS ], which he wants to propose. That is not one of the agreed-upon amendments, but have you been ad- vised of his intention to propose that amendment? Mr. LEWIS of California. That is cor- rect. Mr. STOKES. I thank the gentleman. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, further reserving the right to object, I thank the gentleman for responding. I would hope that, as you discussed, that our amendment concerning drug elimi- nation would be one of the first votes in the morning, since we discussed that at length today and I think the Mem- bers are waiting for it. The CHAIRMAN. Since the Chair would determine the order of the votes, the gentlewoman's amendment would be the first amendment voted on. Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the Chairman. Further reserving the right to object, I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. S ABO]. Mr. SABO. Mr. Chairman, just so Members can understand, my under- standing is that if this unanimous-con- sent is agreed to, there are no addi- tional votes tonight. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I need to include in this unani- mous consent request the rolling over of those amendments, those votes out- standing, but that would be my inten- tion. The CHAIRMAN. The Chair has that authority and, obviously, would be very compassionate in that regard. Mr. SABO. Is that the intent of the Chair? The CHAIRMAN. Yes; it would be the intent of the Chair. There are two votes pending at this time that had rollcall votes requested, the amend- ment of the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. K APTUR ] and the amendment of the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DEFAZIO]. Ms. KAPTUR. To further clarify, Mr. Chairman, in no case would either of those votes occur before 10 o'clock to- morrow morning; is that my under- standing? The CHAIRMAN. At this point that is the Chair's understanding. The Chair was not a party to any decision on that, but at this point that is the Chair's understanding. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, as far as I am concerned, it would be a part of the request, but, Mr. Chair- man, further, I want the Members to know that presuming this is approved and there would be no further votes to- night, there would be a colloquy be- tween the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. OXLEY ] and the gentleman from Indi- ana [Mr. M CINTOSH ], and that would be the end of the business this evening. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, further reserving the right to object, I yield tothe gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. OBEY]. Mr. OBEY. Mr. Chairman, I think it needs to be understood by Members that the understanding was that the majority party wished to come in at 9 o'clock tomorrow, and that in return for that happening, there would be an agreement that while there might be discussion of the amendments cited by the gentleman from California, that, in fact, there would be no votes occurring before 10 a.m. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, that is correct. The CHAIRMAN. The unanimous- consent request is amended to reflect that no votes will occur before 10 a.m. Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Chairman, I with- draw my reservation of objection. The CHAIRMAN. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from California? There was no objection. The CHAIRMAN. Are there further amendments to title III? Mr. M CINTOSH. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy with my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. O XLEY ]. Mr. Chairman, in the current budget climate, all federal agencies need to re- evaluate their priorities, the efficiency of their regulations, and their relation- ships with States. We cannot afford to expend limited resources without achieving commensurate environ- mental or public health gains. One area of concern, that I believe re- quires congressional action involves EPA's development of new ``Phase III and Phase IV land disposal restric- tions'' requirements under the Re- source Conservation and Recovery Act. On March 2, 1996, when the Agency pro- posed the Phase III requirements, EPA itself pointed out that: [T]he risks addressed by this rule, espe- cially [underground injection control] wells, are very small relative to the risks presented by other environmental conditions or situa- tions. In a time of limited resources, com- mon sense dictates that we deal with higher risk activities first, a principle on which EPA, members of the regulated community, and the public can all agree. Nevertheless, the Agency is required [by a court decision] to set treatment standards for these rel- atively low risk wastes and disposal prac- tices during the next two years, although there are other actions and projects with which the Agency could provide greater pro- tection of human health and the environ- ment. I understand that my esteemed col- league from Ohio, Congressman O XLEY , has introduced a corrections bill, H.R. 2036, that would overturn the Chemical Waste Management court decision, which required EPA to undertake this rulemaking. Mr. OXLEY. If the gentleman will yield, Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is correct in his understanding. Section 2 of H.R. 2036 is designed to prevent the imposition of burdensome require- ments on wastewater treatment sys- tems and deep injection wells that al- ready are thoroughly regulated andCONGRESSIONAL RECORD \u00d0HOUSE H7913 July 27, 1995 permitted by the States and EPA under the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Essentially, my bill would authorize EPA to take the course of action that it originally chose. When the Agency first issued its LDR regulations, the Agency con- cluded that imposing treatment re- quirements on these types of nonhazardous waste management sys- tems ``would not provide further pro- tection to human health and the envi- ronment,'' and would cause ``consider- able disruption at facilities that EPA generally considers safe.'' Mr. M CINTOSH. How much does EPA estimate that it would cost to impose the rule required by the court's deci- sion, which would provide little or no environmental or public health gains? Mr. OXLEY. If the gentleman will yield further, EPA's regulatory impact analysis places the cost of this rule at somewhere between one-half billion dollars and three-quarters of a billion dollars each year. That is too steep a price to pay for wasteful and duplica- tive regulation when those resources could do so much more to protect human health and the environment if used elsewhere. Frankly, if the supermandate in H.R. 1022, the Risk Assessment and Cost-Benefit Act, were law, we would not be facing a rule which EPA, itself, believes is so ex- traordinarily wasteful. Mr. M CINTOSH. Again, Mr. Oxley, I commend you for introducing H.R. 2036. Hazardous waste land disposal re- strictions should not be imposed on wastes being managed in units that are permitted under the Clean Water or Safe Drinking Water Acts; nor should land disposal restrictions intended for hazardous wastes be imposed on non- hazardous wastes. Your bill would allow EPA to redirect its scarce re- sources to actions and projects that would achieve the greatest overall ben- efit for the costs incurred. I commend the gentleman for that legislation. Mr. LEWIS of California. Mr. Chair- man, I move that the Committee do now rise. The motion was agreed to. Accordingly the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. F OXof Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. C OMBEST , Chairman of the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union, reported that that Committee, having had under consider- ation the bill (H.R. 2099) making appro- priations for the Departments of Veter- ans Affairs and Housing and Urban De- velopment, and for sundry independent agencies, boards, commissions, cor- porations, and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1996, and for other purposes, had come to no resolu- tion thereon.REPORT ON H.R. 2126, DEPART- MENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIA- TIONS ACT, 1996 Mr. YOUNG of Florida, from the Committee on Appropriations, submit- ted a privileged report (Rept.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of May 12, 1995, and under a previous order of the House, the following Members will be recog- nized for 5 minutes each. /fdash CONGRATULATIONS TO SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD OF WEST VIR- GINIA ON CASTING HIS 14,000 VOTE The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under a previous order of the House, the gen-tleman from West Virginia [Mr. R A- HALL ] is recognized for 5 minutes. Mr. RAHALL. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride and privilege that I rise to announce that U.S. Senator R OBERT C. BYRD, senior senator from West Vir- ginia, earlier today became the first U.S. Senator in history to cast 14,000 votes in the Senate. This 14,000th vote gives Senator B YRDa 98.7 percent vot- ing average over his 37 years of service in the Senate. This voting record covers only Sen- ator B YRD's Senate service, not the years he also served in the U.S. House of Representatives. Senator B YRD's first vote in the Sen- ate, cast on January 8, 1959, was very fitting: It was a vote on Senate proce- dures. Since then, Senator B YRD has become a national celebrity, is recog- nized as the Senate's ``historian in resi- dence,'' and he is recognized as the uncontested expert in the country on the Senate as an institution, about which he has published four volumes, and as a nationally known expert on parliamentary procedure in that body. During the 37-year period in which the 14,000 votes were cast, Senator BYRD has served as: Secretary of the Senate Democratic Conference. Senate Majority Whip, Senator Majority Lead- ers, Senate Minority Leader, and Presi- dent Pro Tempore. Senator B YRD is not only a giant among men in the Senate, he is a giant among men in the Nation. He has been an integral part of the high drama and history of the second half of the 20th century, including the cold war, Viet- nam, Watergate, Iran-Contra, and the collapse of the Soviet Union. He has served in the Senate under nine Presi- dents\u00d0through assassinations and res- ignations. Today, the Senate paused to recog- nize and honor Senator B YRD for his extraordinary leadership and for hav- ing attained the milestones in his leg- islative career that brought him to his 14,000th vote. Those milestones are: Being only one of three U.S. Senators in American his- tory to have been elected to seven 6- year terms; being the first sitting Member of either House of Congress to begin and complete the study of the law and obtain a law degree while serv- ing in the Congress; being the first per- son to carry every county in the State of West Virginia (55 of them) in a con- tested statewide general election; being the only person in the history of West Virginia to ever serve in both chambers of his State legislature and both Houses of the U.S. Congress; ob- taining the greatest number, the great- est percentage, and the greatest mar- gin of votes cast in statewide, con- tested elections in his State; being the first U.S. Senator in West Virginia to win a Senate seat without opposition in a general election; and serving longer in the U.S. Senate than anyone else in West Virginia history. Mr. Speaker, all these milestones of achievement are remarkable in and of "}
