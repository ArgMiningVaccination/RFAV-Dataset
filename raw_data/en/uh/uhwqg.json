ABSTRACT Drug interaction is any modification of response of one drug by simultaneous administration of another drug. The interactions may be either synerg istic or antagonistic. Use of Ayurvedic drugs and allopathic medications concomitantly has led to potential chances for interactions between the drugs of two systems. This paper deals with the drug interactions of some commonly used Ayurvedic and Allopathi c drugs. Guggulu is known to interact with hypolipidaemics, anticoagulants, antihypertensives and thyroid medications. Garlic interacts with anticoagulants, NSAIDs by anti platelet activity. Aswagandha may potentiate the effects of barbiturates. Concomitan t use of castor oil reduces the efficacy of antiarrythmic drugs, diuretics, fat soluble vitamins and antihistamines. Yashtimadhu increases potassium loss and so prolonged use with thiazide and loop diuretics may be harmful . Other examples include the inte ractions of herbs like Tulsi with paracetamol, with hypolipidaemic drugs and Vasa with theophylline. Proper knowledge of drug interaction can be use ful. For example Risorine, an anti -tuberculosis drug has been developed on the basis of synergistic interactions of piperine from Pippali with rifampicin. Important mechanisms involved in ayurvedic - allopathic drug interactions are alteration of absorption and induction or inhibition of cytochrome systems. The methods to avoid these interactions include taking a detailed drug history before prescribing, correct timing of medications , identifying risky patients and risky drugs and proper regulation in the sa le of medications .

KEYWORDS : Drug interaction, Ayurvedic, Allopathic . INTRODUCTION Use of alternative systems of medicine is at rise globally. Ayurveda, the oldest herbal system of medicine is the most commonly practiced alternative system in India fulfilling the medical needs of 80% of the population.[1] Many a times people tend to use more than one system medicine simultaneously. In a study conducted in Australia, 50 % of people reported that they used alternative therapy along with conventional medicine.[2] For example , in Kerala , people prefer allopathic medicines for emergency conditions and Ayurvedic medications for chronic ailments like arthritis. Regardless of the system of medicine, its an acknowledged fact that every drug, Ayurvedic or a llopathic , has constituents in them that has th e potency to affect metabolism. These chemical constituents may interact with each other . These drug interactions can affect the end result of either drug countering the effects or enhancing of the other drug , and at the end producing a better or worse, but certainly different outcome of the singular parts in their action. Some of the interactions may not be clinically relevant and some others may be beneficial for betterment of pharmaceuticals . So all the possible drug interactions should be listed out and important ones should be established . But there is a severe deficiency in st udies reporting these types of interactions. This paper attempts to review major Ayurvedic - allopathic drug interactions . METHODOLOGY The study was a literary review study and a general Google search was done. The keywords used were interaction, herb -drug interaction and interactions of individual drug. RESULT Drug interactions -Definition Drug interactions result from the use of two or more drugs simultaneously. It is the modification of response to one drug by another when they are administered simult aneously or in quick succession .[3] This may lead to enhanced or diminished effect that may be useful or harmful. The action of one drug is affected by the other drug either quantitatively i.e. increased or decreased intensity of action or qualitatively, i .e. an abnormal or a different type of response is produced. Dhanya et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research www.wjpr.net Vol 6, Issue 3, 2017. 480 If any new symptom arise during treatment in a person receiving multiple medications and if more than one drug in this medication list is capable of causing the same new symptom, then the physici an should always consider the scope of drug interactions. All drug treatment should be reviewed, if the clinical condition of a severely ill or elderly patient changes . A physician who is giving medicines to a patient already receiving treatment from anoth er doctor or another system of medicine should be constantly alert to the possibility of drug interactions. The physician should be aware of drugs prone to interaction and patients in whom interaction may occur. He should be cautious while administering t wo drugs with same pharmacological property, while combining drugs that affect the vital process in the body, drugs showing dose dependent toxicity, drugs whose loss of effect leads to breakthrough of disease. The patients more prone for drug interactions are elderly patients receiving many drugs, patients with unstable disease like epilepsy, patients with liver or kidney damage, patients receiving treatment for very serious condition and patients receiving medicine whose variation in dose or properties of drug can lead to death.[4] When two or more drugs are given simultaneously or in quick succession, they may exhibit either synergism or antagonism. Drug interactions can be either synergistic or antagonistic. Synergism is when the action of one drug is fa cilitated or increased by the other. In a synergistic pair, both the drugs can have action in the same direction or given alone one may be inactive but still enhance the action of the other when given together. When one drug decreases or abolishes the acti on of another, they are said to be antagonistic. Usually in an antagonistic pair one drug is inactive as such but decreases the effect of the other. Of clinical significance is the unintended concurrent administration of synergistic or antagonistic pair of drugs with adverse consequences. Mechanism of drug interaction The mechanism of drug interaction is very complex and not completely understood. But it is generally considered that drug interactions occur due to pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic reasons. A pharmacokinetic interaction means one drug altering the absorption, distribution, metabolism or elimina tion of other drug. The concentration of the drug at its site of action is altered by these types of interactions and as a result the intensity of re sponse of the drug is Dhanya et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research www.wjpr.net Vol 6, Issue 3, 2017. 481 affected. For example Aloe vera a mild laxative reduces the intestinal transit time of orally administered drugs. This hinders the absorption of concurrently orally administered drugs. Drugs alter the absorption of other drug s by form ing complexes with them in gut or by altering the gastric pH and thus decreasing the solubility of the other drug or by accelerating the absorption of other drug. Many drugs share the same transport system or protein binding sites and can interfere with th e distribution of other drugs. Microsomal enzyme system especially cytochrome P450 have a major role in the metabolism of drugs. Synthesis of cytochrome P450 can lead to reduced efficacy of the drug. Agents like ethanol stimulate the synthesis of this enzy me system and can interact with drug metabolism. Drugs facilitate the excretion of concurrently administered drugs by increasing urine flow or by altering the pH of urine. A pharmacodynamic interaction occurs in between drugs which act on the same target site. These interactions occur due to modification of the action of one drug at the target site by another drug, independent of a change in its concentration. It mostly happens between drugs with same pharmacological activities on one system. For example Sarpagandha has synergistic effects when concomitantly used with other anti -hypertensive . These types of drug interactions mainly occur between drugs acting on the same receptor site or at different active receptors and thereby increasing or decreasing the response of one another. Of all the mechanisms, the most important mechanisms involved in ayurvedic - allopathic drug interactions are alteration of absorption, for example laxatives and induction or inhibition of cytochrome systems, for example grape frui t juice, garlic, berberine of Daruharidra . Drug interaction between Ayurvedic and allopathic drugs The increasing popularity of alternative medicine has created a new situation -simultaneous use of medicines of more than one system of medicine. Ayurveda be ing the most popular alternative medicine in India, more and more Ayurvedic drugs are used by people simultaneously with allopathic medicines to treat the same symptom or any other symptom. Allopathic drugs for lifestyle diseases like diabetes, hypertensio n, thyroid medications are taken on daily basis and are lifelong. Simultaneously , patients take Ayurvedic medicines for arthritis, neurological complaints or skin diseases. And what is worse is that many Ayurvedic medicines are having over the counter prof ile than prescription medicine status. This creates an increasing chance for interactions between these drugs. Chances of interactions are more Dhanya et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research www.wjpr.net Vol 6, Issue 3, 2017. 482 with daily medication, medicines that affect vital functions and medicine with narrow therapeutic margin. Major herbs that are to be looked for interactions and the drugs with which they interact are given below. Drug interactions involving Guggulu (Commiphora mukul )[5] Guggulu is studied for interactions with hypolipidaemics, anticoagulants, antihypertensives and thyroid medications. Guggulu is well known for its hypolipidaemic property. Guggulusterone present in Guggulu lowers cholesterol by the following methods. It increases the rate of removal of cholesterol from the body, decreases the hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis and the ion exchange resin in the crude drug traps the bile acid containing cholesterol and thereby trapping it out of intrahepatic circulation. So Guggulu has synergistic effect when combined with hypolipidaemics. It potentiates the cholesterol and triglyceride lowering effects of hypolipidaemics . Thus it lowers the dose of the hypolipidaemic or eliminates the need of the drug. It should be used with caution when combined with warfarin and other anticoagulan ts, as it has antiplatelet activity and can increase the clotting time . It stimulates the thyroid gland and is especially useful where tri iodo thyronine (T3) levels are low. So it may alter the dosing requirements of thyro id medications . Guggululipid an active of when propanolol, an antihypertensive or diltiazem the bioavailability of these drugs . And also guggullipids is known to have anti -inflammatory activity and can reduce the dose of NSAIDs when used simultaneously. Drug interactio n involving Rasona Rasona by decreasing platelet aggregation activity and may lead to bleeding tendencies. It may also interact along with high doses of alpha tocopherol that is vitami n E. It is reported to change pharmacokinetic variables of paracetamol, decreases blood concentrations of warfarin and produces hypoglycaemia when taken with chlorpropamide.[6] Rasona reduces the plasma level concentration of saquinavir, antiretroviral dru g used in HIV therapy and can also interact with other protease inhibitors.[7] Drug interactions involving Aswagandha (Withania somnifera) and mild sedative property may potentiate the effects of barbiturates and sedatives wh en used simultaneously. The drug has additive effect when used in combination with diazepam. The combination when used in status epilepticus was able to Dhanya et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research www.wjpr.net Vol 6, Issue 3, 2017. 483 reduce significantly the effective dose of diazepam and offer complete protection with no subsequent mo rtality. Drug interaction involving Sunti (Zingiber officinale) Sunti can interact with anti -inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen. It can also interact with aspirin, warfarin, heparin and other drugs that effect bleeding tendencies or platelet count . The anti -inflammatory action of Sunti is thought to be due to the inhibition of prostaglandin release and may act in the similar way as NSAIDs, which interfere with prostaglandin biosynthesis. Sunti inhibit platelet aggregation and reduces platelet throm boxane synthesis and so can interfere with medications like anticoagulants. Drug interaction involving Jatamamsi (Nardostachys jatamamsi) Jatamamsi is to be given cautiously in patients on benzodiazepine or any other sedative medicine. It is also to be gi ven with caution with anti hypertensive medicine as it may have additive effect. Drug interaction involving Yashtimadhu (Glycyrrhiza glabra) Glycyrrhizin in Yashtimadhu decreases plasma clearance , and increases plasma concentration of prednisolone and thu s its action is enhanced. It also causes hypertension, oedema and hypokalemia when simultaneously used with oral contraceptives. It is reported that oral contraceptive use may increase sensitivity to glycyrrhizin. Women are reportedly more sensitive than m en to adverse effects of Yashtimadhu. It should not be administered for prolonged time with thiazide and loop diuretics because it increases potassium loss. Drug interaction involving alcohol Arishtas and asavas are major dosage forms used in Ayurveda. Th ey contain varying range of alcohol content. Alcohol is known to interact with aspirin and NSAIDs and cause increased risk of gastric mucosal damage and gastric bleeding. Many medications cause an unpleasant hypersensitivity to alcohol called \"disulfiram e ffect\". Examples of such medications are antibiotics like metronidazole and tinidazole , sulfonylureas like tolbutamide etc. Other examples of Ayurvedic - allopathic drug interactions Concomitant use of castor oil (Ricinus communis ) reduces the efficacy of antiarrythmic drugs, diuretics, fat soluble vitamins and antihistamines.[8] As it contains L -dopa, Kapikachu (Mucuna pruriens) medicine. Bhanga (Cannabis Dhanya et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research www.wjpr.net Vol 6, Issue 3, 2017. 484 sativa ) have additive effects with barbiturates potentia ting its depressant action. It should be used cautiously with antihistamines, phenothiazines and benzodiazepines. Tulsi (Ocimum sanctum) has been reported as hepatotoxic in rats with glutathione depleted liver. So concurrent use with paracetamol which depl etes glutathione may be harmful. the concentration of phenytoin, propanolol and theophylline.[9] Other examples include the Methika vulgare) )with theophylline, a bronchodilator. Benefits of drug interactions Proper knowledge of drug interaction can have r adical effects in future pharmaceuticals. For example Risorine, an anti -tuberculosis drug manufactured by Cadila combines rifampicin and piperine. This has been developed on the basis of synergistic interactions of piperine from pippali with rifampicin. It contains almost sixty percent less dose of rifampicin than usual.[10] Women being treated for polycystic ovary syndrome with spironolactone has side effects of diuresis, low blood pressure, volume depletion. Studies shows that these side effects can be reduced by combining spironolactone with Yashtimadhu. In patients of PCOS the mineralocorticoid properties of Yashtimadhu can reduce the prevalence of side effects related to the diuretic activity of spironolactone. Studies also showed that the combination of Yashtimadhu and spironolactone reduced the prevalence of metrorrhagia in studied population.[11] Methods to avoid drug interaction Today when more and more people are using one or more systems of medicine for same or different diseases, drug interactio ns can happen. There are no fool -proof methods to avoid these interactions as there mechanisms are ill -understood and complex. But based upon the present knowledge we can devise some basic necessary steps towards preventing this issue. They include Taking a detailed history of all the drugs used by an individual before prescribing Correct timing of medications. Administer drugs with caution in elderly patients and patients with kidney and liver damage Dhanya et al. World Journal of Pharmaceutical Research www.wjpr.net Vol 6, Issue 3, 2017. 485 Be careful while combining drugs with same pharmacolog ical property and drugs that affect vital process in body and drugs having narrow therapeutic index. Strict regulation on the sales of Ayurvedic medications as many of it are taken without prescription of a registered practitioner. Identify drugs that are possible candidates for interaction. Create database about clinically relevant drug interactions . CONCLUSION The increasing popularity of Ayurveda has led to the concurrent use of the medicines in the system with allopathic medicines. The free availabilit y of even single drug choornas as over the counter medicine and its irrational use at any time concurrently with any medicine has increased the chance of drug interactions . A detailed study on the possible candidates of Ayurvedic and allopathic drugs which may interact with each other is needed and it should be established by experimental studies. Also the beneficial combinations can be found out and used for removing the side effects of or decreasing the dose of important drugs . To conclude what becomes im portant is creating a detailed database about clinically relevant interactions of Ayurvedic and Allopathic drugs and making awareness about these types of interactions so that the patients life will never be at risk.
