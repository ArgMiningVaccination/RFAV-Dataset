We offer a true cleanse and detoxification process, that will leave you feeling healthier and happier. We live in a world full of toxic food and stress. As such, we absorb what is in our environment despite our best attempts to stay healthy. A whole body cleanse will start you on the path toward health. Cleansing diets are designed to release toxins from storage in the body's cells and tissues. Toxins are created as byproducts of our metabolism, and as we interact with our environment through the food, air and water we take into our bodies. When toxins are released from cells they enter the bloodstream and can cause a variety of symptoms, such as fatigue, nausea, weakness, poor recovery, lack of motivation, muscle and joint pain and others. You can think of toxins as 'pollution' from our bodily factories. They have the tendency to build up in the body, inhibiting various functions of the body - and keep us out of balance and moving away from health. Most often the storage site is the adipose, or fat tissue. More adipose tissue allows for more storage of toxins; toxins can even block the removal of adipose tissue. This is why cleansing, leading into a weight loss reduction cycle can help to 'kickstart' this metabolic process. Ever wish you could 'push the reset button' and start your health anew? Well here is your opportunity! You will experience the best of natural medicine to create a powerful, transformative health renewal undergoing our doctor-supervised whole body cleanse and natural detox. During this experience, you will gain practical insights into your health and how to renew it while undergoing a medically supervised detoxification and cleanse. Regardless of your health, a whole body cleanse will set you on a path of greater health, vitality and fitness. If you're looking to take your health to the next level, whether you're looking to get healthier or recover from a serious illness, our whole body cleanse and natural detox will get you started on the right path. There are plenty of rip-off/gimmicky procedures out there claiming miraculous outcomes that seem to bend the laws of nature and human physiology. These are typically nothing more than expensive laxatives - just going to the bathroom a bunch, or soaking your feet in a tub, IS NOT a detox. There's a lot more to it - undergoing a whole body detox supervised by a doctor experienced in natural medicine is the way to go, if you're going to invest the time and energy - not to mention your health!
