So why not teach school kids some of the activities they'd go on to enjoy later in life? Do you often forget where you put the keys or what you were looking for in the fridge? It's not necessarily a sign of cognitive decline - it might just come down to being tired, stressed or worried. Is grunting a sign that we're ageing fast? Or is it just one of those things that come with the middle years, like reading glasses, greying hair and 'dad jokes'? Many chronic diseases increase our risk of Alzheimer's disease. This link between our bodies and our brains means certain healthy choices could protect our cognitive function. An enzyme called TOR could hold the secret to a longer, healthier life. The focus on the ageing of women is by no means a modern phenomenon. A muscle-wasting condition called sarcopenia affects up to one-third of older adults. The good news is that people with sarcopenia can rebuild their muscle mass. It may look like a whiskered cocktail sausage, but the naked mole rat's incredible biology may one day improve countless lives. A new study reveals that older adults - even those chronically ill - feel at least 20 years younger than their chronological age. What are the implications for those who run seniors centres? Rates of elective surgery are rising most among those aged over 85, due to advances in anaesthesia and techniques such as keyhole surgery. But it's also much riskier. Older people may be vulnerable to the physiological effects of anger, but not sadness. Creative arts therapies allow people with dementia to express joy and sadness through painting, dance, music and drama. The aged care royal commission begins hearing evidence today about the quality of care in nursing homes. These 10 charts show how the current system works and the challenges it faces. Why some individuals age faster than others is a mystery, but new research suggests help with childcare is significant. The adjuvanted flu vaccine is free for over-65s and offers better protection than the standard vaccine. Here's what the research says. This week the aged care royal commission heard evidence of long waits for home care, poorly trained staff and high fees. These 10 charts explain how the system works and why it's under such pressure. If you don't plan for your aged care and make your wishes known, you may be admitted to a hospital or aged care facility when something goes wrong. That's where most Australians end up dying. There's good evidence to suggest a midlife crisis exists, though it's hard to define what the midlife is. And perhaps crises that occur during midlife might equally have occurred before or after. As you age, your body deteriorates and your risk of disease and injury increases. Here's a decade by decade guide to what you're up against - and what you can do about it. Research shows that feeling younger than you are could be good for you. "}
