The high prevalence of upper respiratory tract infection necessitates a safe and effective anti - inflammatory agent fo r pharyngitis. Chinese herbal medicine, which has been clin i- cally prescribed for thousands of years, may offer a basis for the treatment of co m- mon cold as well as the amelioration of pharyngitis. In the present study, we invest i- gated the in vitro and in vi vo anti-inflammatory activities of a Chinese herbal fo r- mula, namely GPC, which 100 and 300 g/mL) suppress ed the releases of tumor necrosis factor (TNF -), interleukin 6 (IL -6) and nitric oxide in lipopolysaccharide/peptidoglycan - activated RAW264.7 macrophages. In addition to the cell -based study, long -term treatment with GPC (0.35, 1.05 and 2.10 mL/kg/day \u00d7 30 doses) was found to reduce the extent of inflammation in animal models of carrageenan -induced paw edema (acute inflammation) as well as cotton pellet -induced granuloma formation (chronic inflammation) in mice. The ability of GPC to enhance the tracheo bronchial expect o- rant action suggested its immunomodulatory activity in the respiratory tract.

The ensemble of results suggests that GPC may offer a promising prospect for alleviating the extent of pharyngitis by virtue of anti - inflammatory Inflammatory response, which is an essential component of innate immunity, enables the removal of pathogens and facilitates antigen presentation via a series of complex interplays among immune cells [1] . Upper respiratory tract infection, which triggers in- flammatory responses in buccal cavity, nose, pharynx and trachea, is commonly found in patients suffering from common cold [2] . In this regard, group A Streptococcus , which causes 700 million infections each year [3] , has been found to be the most prev a- lent cause of acute bacterial pharyngitis ( i.e. an inflammation in the pharynx) in chil d- ren, adolescents, and young adults [4] . Therapeutic intervention using anti -inflamma- tory agents on group A streptococcal pharyngitis is therefore widely needed. Chinese herbal medicine, which has long been prescribed for the treatment of upper respiratory tract infection, may offer an important resource for the search of such anti -inflamma - tory agents from naturally -occurring herbs. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo anti-inflammatory ac- tivities of a Chinese herbal formula, namely Herba. The component herbs are traditionally used for the treatment of common cold as well as the amelioration of pharyngitis. We first examined the effect of GPC on the releases of tumor necrosis factor (TNF -) and interleukin 6 (IL -6), as well as the production of nitric oxide (NO) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)/ peptidoglycan (PGN) - activated RAW264.7 macrophages. Subsequently, the effects of long -term treatment with GPC in carrageenan- induced paw edema in mice (an animal model of acute i n- flammation) as well as cotton pellet -induced granuloma formation in mice (an animal model of chronic inflammation) were investigated. Furthermore, we examined the e f- fect of long -term treatment with GPC on tracheobronchial expectorant action in mice. The effect of long -term treatment with GPC in capsaicin -induced pharyngitis and the associated releases of cytokines (TNF - and IL -6) were also investigated in rats. To e x- plore whether long -term treatment with AS1505 can cause hepatotoxicity, plasma al a- nine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities, which are biochemical parameters of hepatic damage, were measured in animals receiving long -term treatment with GPC.

RPMI 1640 medium, dexamethasone, LPS, PGN, capsaicin, Evans Blue, ind o- methacin and phenol red (sodium salt) were purchased fr om Sigma -Aldrich Co (St. Louis, MO, USA). Carrageenan ( -form) was bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA, USA). TNF - and IL -6 ELISA kits were purchased from Shanghai ExCell Biology Inc. (Shanghai, China). The herbal formula GPC was pro vided by Infi- nitus (Guangzhou, Guangdong, China). ratio o f 2:1:1:1:2 (w/w, dried herb). ALT and AST assay kit s were purchased from Stanbio Laboratory (Boerne, TX, USA). All other chemicals were of analytical grade. 2.2. Cell Culture A murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA). RAW264.7 cells were cultured in a monolayer using DMEM 1mM sodium pyruvate. RAW 264.7 cells were kept at 37 C in a humidified atmo s- phere of air and 5% CO 2. RAW264.7 cells used for the experiments were seeded at a density of 1.25 \u00d7 105 cell/mL on a 48 -well culture plate and were allowed to grow to 60% - 80% confluence within 24 h prior to incubation with GPC. 2.3. Lipopolysaccharide/ Peptidoglycan Induced 300 g/mL, 1% PBS -A] for 24 h. The GPC -incubated cells were exposed to LPS (1 g/mL) or PGN (30 g/mL) for 24 h. Then, the concentration of nitrite (which is an indir ect measure of nitric oxide production) in the culture medium was measured using the method of Griess [5] . The LPS/PGN -induced IL -6 were meas ured using ELISA kits a c- cording to manufacturer's instruction. 2.4. Animal Care Male Balb/c mice (8 - 10 weeks old, 25 - 30 g) and male Sprague Dawley rats (8 - 10 weeks old, 450 - 500 g) were maintained under a 12 -h dark/light cycle at about 22 C, and allowed food and water ad libitum in the Animal and Plant Care Facilities at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST). All experimental prot o- cols were approved by the University Committee on Research Practice at the HKUST. 2.5. Long -Term Treatment with GPC Male Balb/c mice (8 - 10 weeks old, 25 - 30 g) were orally administered with GPC (0.35, P. K. Leong et al. 156 1.05 and 2.10 mL/kg/day \u00d7 30 doses). Male Sprague Dawley rats with GPC (0.18, 0.53 and 1.05 mL/kg/day \u00d7 30 doses). The doses of 1 .05 mL/kg/day in mice and 0.53 mL/kg/day in rats are equivalent to the daily recommended dose for h u- man. Twenty -four hours after the last dosing with GPC, mice/rats were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection with a mixture of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylzine in sterile saline. were dr awn from ketamine/xylzine -anes- thetized mice/rats by cardiac puncture. Rodents were then sacrificed by cardiac excision under anesthesia. Plasma samples were obtained by centrifugation at 4 00 \u00d7g at 4 C for 10 min. The potential hepatotoxicity of long -term GPC treatment in mice/rats was as- sessed by measuring plasma activities of ALT and AST using assay kits. 2.6. Effect of GPC Treatment on Carrageenan -Induced Paw Edema in Mice Male Balb/c mi ce were randomly divided into 6 groups of 4 - 8 animals: 1) vehicle co n- trol; 2) carrageenan control ; 3) carrageenan + dexamethansone (positive control) ; 4) carrageenan + GPC (0.35 mL/kg) ; 5) carrageenan + GPC (1.05 mL/ and 6) carr a- geenan + GPC (2.10 mL/kg). Mice were orally administered with GPC for 30 doses, as previously described. For the positive control group, mice were intraperitoneally i n- jected with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg) 30 minutes before the carrageenan challenge. Thirty minutes after the l ast dosing with GPC, mice were anesthetized by intraperit o- neal injection with a mixture of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 10 mg/kg xylzine in sterile sa- line. The thickness of left hind limb in ketamine/xyline -anesthetized mice was mea s- ured (as initial thickness), followed by an injection with carrageenan (50 L, 1% (w/v) in sterile saline). The changes in paw thickness were measured using a digital caliper (Mitutoyo, Japan) and monitored for 4 h. Mice were then sacrificed by cardiac excision under ketamine chloride -induced anesthesia and paw tissue was obtained. Paw tissue was homogenized with 2.5 mL homogenizing buffer [10 mM 4 -(2-hydroxyethyl) -1- piperazineethanesulfonic acid, 100 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic using a tissue homogenizer ULTR A-TURRAX T25 (IKA laboratory technology, Wi l- mington, NC, USA) at 95,000 rpm, and the cytosolic fraction was obtained by centrifu- gation at 10,000 \u00d7g for 20 min at 4 C [6]. 2.7. Effect of GPC Treatment on Cotton Pellet -Induced Granuloma Formation in Mice Male Balb/c mice (~8 weeks of age) were randomly divided into 5 groups of 6 - 8 ani- mals in each group: 1) control, 2) indomethacin (positive control), 3) GPC (0.35 mL/ kg), 05 mL/kg) and 5) GPC (2.10 mL/ kg). Mice were orally administered with GPC for 30 doses, as described earlier. For the positive control group, the mice were orally administered with indomethacin (10 mg/kg/day \u00d7 7 doses). At the 24th dose o f GPC (or the 1st dose of indomethacin), mice were anesthetized by a mixture of ketamine/xylzine in sterile saline. Dorsal hairs were shaved and the skin was wiped with 70% [(v/v) in H 2O] ethanol in preparation for cotton pellet implantation. The sterilized P. K. Leong et al. 157 and pre -weighed cotton pellet was aseptically implanted into a subcutaneous pouch. A cotton pellet was implanted on the left dorsal and right dorsal sides, respectively, in each mouse [7]. Twenty -four hours after the last dosing with GPC or indomethacin, the implanted cotton pellets were removed from ketamine/xylzine -anesthetized mice and they w ere weighed (showing wet weight) [7] . The wet cotton pellets were dried in an oven at 60 C for 24 h and then weighed (showing dry weight). The net increase in wet weight (as compared with the initial weight) of the cotton pellet is indicative of the d e- gree of inflammatory response in transudative phase, whereas the extent of proliferative phase is indicated by the net increase in dry weight. The weights of two pellet s from each individual animal were averaged. Data were expressed as net wet weight ( i.e. wet weight initial weight) and net dry weight ( i.e. dry weight initial weight). Percentage inhibitio n was Expectorant Action in Mice The tracheobronchial expectorant action was assessed by phenol red secretion test. In brief, male Balb/c mice were rand omly divided into 5 groups of 6 animals: 1) control, 2) ammonium chloride (1 g/kg, positive control), 3) GPC (0.35 (1.05 mL/kg) and 5) GPC (2.10 mL/kg). Mice were orally administered with GPC for 30 do s- es, as previously described. For the p ositive control, mice were orally administered with a single bolus dose of ammonium chloride (1g/ kg) at 30 min prior to the phenol red injection. After the last dosing with GPC/ positive control, mice were intraperitoneally injected with phenol red (500 mg/ kg in saline). At thirty -minutes post -injection, the mice were sacrificed and the tracheas (0.3 cm) were excised and incubated with an i n- cubation buffer (0.9% saline with 0.2 M NaOH) at room temperature for 30 min under vortex mixing. An aliquot of 200 L of the supernatant from each incubated sample was measured spectrophotometrically at 550 nm, using Victor3 Multi -Label Counter (Pe r- kin-Elmer, USA). The amount of phenol red eliminated in the tracheobronchial secr e- tion was estimated using a phenol red stand ard calibration curve [8] . 2.9. Effect of GPC -Induced Pharyngitis in Rats Male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 6 groups of 6 animals: 1) co n- trol; 2) capsaicin control ; 3) capsaicin + dexamethasone (1 positive control) ; 4) mL/kg) 5) 6) capsaicin + GPC (1.05 mL/kg). Rats were orally administered with GPC for 30 doses, as previously described. For the positive control group, mice were orally administered with dexam e- thasone (1 mg/kg/day \u00d7 10 doses). Twenty -four last with GPC/ dexamethasone, the ketamine/xylzine- anaesthetized rats were intravenously injected (via lateral tail vein) with Evans B lue dye (60 mg/kg in saline). At 10 min post -injection with Evan Blue dye, capsaicin (0.3 mM, dissolved in a mixture of 10% ethanol - 10% P. K. Leong et al. 158 Tween 20 % - 80% distilled water) was applied to the pharyngeal mucosa us ing cotton swab, while control animals received the vehicle. In brief, capsaicin solution was gently applied with the aid of a cotton swab for 5 seconds at each time point for three times consecutively. At 60 min following capsaicin application, all rats w ere sacrificed by ex- sanguination. Fifty microliters of 5% Na2EDTA in saline was injected into the rat via the inferior vena cava and then perfused with pre -warmed Krebs- Henseleit buffer (120 mM NaCl, 25.4 mM NaHCO 4.8 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH2PO4, 0.86 mM MgSO47H2O, 1.25 mM CaCl22H2O and 11 mM glucose, pH 7.4) for 20 min at a rate of approximately 28 mL/ min to expel the intravascular Evan Blue dye. The bilateral musculus masseter of the rat was incised and the lower jaw was removed to enable the extirpation of the ph a- rynx. The portion of pharynx spanning from the caudal end of the soft palate to the e p- iglottis was isolated and weighed (approximately 40 - 50 mg). The Evan Blue dye trapped in the tissue was extracted in formamide at 55 C for 24 h and the amount o f Evan blue dye was measured spectrophotometrically at 600 nm. The content of dye in tissue was expressed as microgram of dye per gram of tissue wet weight. The extravas a- tion of Evan Blue dye into the pharyngeal tissue is a quantitative evaluation of the c ap- saicin -induced plasma exudation in rat pharyngeal mucosa [9]. In parallel with the above experiment, another set of experiments was conducted u s- ing the same protocol except for the administration of Evan Blue dye. The plasma sam- ples of GPC/dexamethasone- treated, capsaicin -challenged rats were collected and su b- jected to the measurement of TNF - and IL -6 using ELISA kits. 2.10. Statistical Analysis Data were analyzed by one- way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Post -hoc multiple comparisons were performed using TUKEY test. P values < 0.05 were regarded as st atis- tically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 6.0 and SPSS 17.0. 3. Res ults GPC Incubation (LPS) RAW264.7 Macrophages with GPC tended to decrease the production of TNF - (by 31% at 300 g/mL) in LPS -activated RAW264.7 macrophages ( Figure 1 (a)). GPC incubation (at 10, 30 and 300 g/mL) also suppressed the production of IL -6 (43, 58 and 76%, respectively) and NO (13, 29 and 73%) in LPS -activated RAW264.7 cells. Dexamethasone incubation (5 M) drastically suppressed the releases of TNF - (74%), IL -6 (73%) and NO (87%) in LPS -activated RAW264.7 cells. GPC incubation suppressed the production of IL -6 (35, 48 and 74%) and NO (53, 64 and 83%) in PGN -activated RAW264.7 cells ( Figure 1 (b)). However, GPC incubation did not inhibit the releases of TNF - in PGN -activated RAW264.7 cells. Dexameth a- sone - (61%), IL -6 (81%) and NO (82%) P. K. Leong et al. 159 Figure 1.

Effects of Long -Term Treatment with GPC on Carrageenan -Induced Paw Edema in Mice Carrageenan injection caused a significant increase (104%) in paw thickness in mice. Long -term treatment with GPC suppressed the carrageenan -induced increase in paw thickness ( Figure 2 ), with the extent of inhibition being 36% (at 2.1 mL/kg), when compared with the un -treated control. Dexamethasone treatment significantly inh i- bited the car rageenan -induced increase in paw thickness (by 45%). 3.3. Effect of Long -Term GPC Treatment on Cotton Pellet -Induced Granuloma Formation in Mice Long -term treatment with GPC (at 2.1 mL/kg) suppressed the increases in both net wet weight (12.7%) and net dr y weight (18.1%) of cotton pellets in mice induced with gr a- nuloma formation ( Table 1 ). Indomethacin treatment also inhibited the increases in wet weight (14.1%) and dry weight (24.7%) of cotton pellets. 3.4. Effects of Long -Term Treatme nt with GPC on Phenol Red Expectorant in Mice Long -term treatment with GPC increased the amount of expectorant in mice, with the degree of stimulation being 30% (at 2.1 mL/kg) ( Figure 3 ).

Effects of Long -Term Treatment with GPC on Evans Blue Extravasation of Pharyngeal Tissue and Plasma Cytokine Levels in Capsaicin -Challenged Rats Capsaicin challenge caused a drastic increase (208%) in the extent of Evan Blue extr a- vasation in pharyngeal tissue of rats ( Figure 4 (a)). Long -term treatment with GPC suppressed (37 and 55% at 0.53 and 1.05 mL/kg, respectively) the Evan Blue extravas a- tion. Dexamethasone treatment inhibited the extent of Evan Blue extravasation to a larger extent (by 87%) than those of GPC. Capsaicin challenge also caused an increase in plasma level of IL -6 (31%) in rats (Figure 4 (b)), but plasma level of TNF - was decreased (by 59%) ( Figure 4 (c)). The P. K.

Tw enty-four hours after the last dosing with GPC/dexamethasone, the ketamine/xylzine- anaesthetized rats were intravenousl y injected with Evans Blue dye (60 mg/ kg in saline) via the lateral tail vein.

Discussion Pathogen -associated molecular patterns are highly conserved molecular moieties that can be recognized by the innate immune system. As such, LPS (a commonly found molecule on gram- negative bacterial surface) as well as PGN (a commonly found mo- lecule on gram- positive bacterial surface) can be recognized by toll -like receptor 4 and 6, respectively, in monocytes, with a subsequent activation into pro -inflammatory m a- crophages [10]. In this regard, a cell model of LPS/PGN- activated macrophages is commonly used for screening anti -inflammatory agents. In the present study, the find- ing that GPC incubation reduced the extent of inflammatory response in LPS/PGN - activated RAW264.7 macrophages, as evidenced by decreases in the releases of TNF -, IL-6 and NO, is corroborated by the anti -inflammatory effects produced by long -term GPC treatment in rodent models of acute inflammation (carrageenan- induced paw edema) as well as chronic inflammation (cotton pellet -induced granuloma formation) in mice. In addition, the ability of GPC to enhance the tracheobronchial expectorant action may suggest its immunomodulatory activity in the respiratory tract. This pos t- ulation was supported by the observation that GPC reduced the degree of capsaicin - induced pharyngitis in rats. While the biochemical mechanism underlying the differe n- tial action of capsaicin challenge in modulating plasma levels of TN F- and IL -6 in rats is yet to be investigated, the suppression afforded by GPC treatment on capsaicin - induced pharyngitis was associated with the reversal changes in plasma TNF - and IL -6 levels in capsaicin -irritated rats. The result indicates the abil ity of GPC to protect against capsaicin- induced pharyngitis. Given the high prevalence of upper respiratory tract infection, the ability of GPC to ameliorate capsaicin -induced pharyngitis may be used for alleviating the respiratory tract inflammation cause d by infections. The anti -inflammatory response induced by GPC is likely attributed to the pharm a- cological activity of each component herb. Recently, Fu et al. have made a survey on component herbs used in classical Chinese herbal prescriptions for treatin g respiratory diseases. It was found that Glycyrrhizae Radix was the most frequently used herb among the selected prescriptions [11] . This observation suggests that Glycyrrhizae R a- dix may play a pivotal role in the anti -inflammatory action of GPC. In support of this, various compounds isolated from Glycyrrhizae Radix were found to elicit anti -in- flammatory response in vitro and in vivo . As such, diammonium glycyrrhi zinate was found to attenuate the extent of hepatitis in concanavalin A -injected mice, presumably via the suppression on the release of pro -inflammatory cytokines [12] . Glycyrol was shown to suppress the levels of pro -inflammatory cytokines as well as inflammatory e f- fector molecules in LPS -activated RAW264.7 macrophages [13] . Licochalcone A w , which serves as a screening study, as found to attenuate the allergic airway inflamma- tion in ovalbumin- induced asthma mice [14] . The aqueous extract of Platycodonis R a- dix, which is also a component herb in GPC, was found to inhibit the nuclear factor - B-mediated expression of pro -inflammatory effectors in LPS -activat ed human cu l-P. K. Leong et al. 164 tured airway epithelial cells [15] as well as suppress the airway inflammation in oval- bumin -induced asthma mice [16]. Despite the fact that -inflammatory effect of Citri Reticulatae Pericarpium and Phyllanthi Fructus on respiratory tract has not been reported, they were found to produce anti -inflammatory effect in LPS -activated vasc u- lar epithelial cells [17] and LPS Behcet's disease -like symptoms in herpes simplex virus -infected mice, possibly through modulating the profile of cytokines [19]. The finding suggests that Taraxaci Herba may serve as a complementary herb in potentiating the anti -inflammatory action of other component herbs in GPC. Further investigation is required to investigate whether the component herbs of GPC can act additively or synergistically in eliciting an anti - inflammatory response. 5. Conclusion In conclusion, the ensemble of results suggests that GPC may offer a promising pro s- pect for producing an anti -inflammatory action, particularly for alleviating the extent of pharyngitis. F urther studies are required to investigate the role of individual herb component in GPC in producing anti -inflammatory response as well as the biochemical mechanism underlying t he anti -inflammatory action of GPC.
