STATEMENTS No statement will void the insurance under this Policy, or be used in defense of a claim hereunder unless: a. in the case of this Policyholder, it is contained in the application signed by the Policyholder; or b. in the case of a Covered Person, it is contained in a written instrument signed by the Covered Person, and a copy of which is furnished to the Covered Person. All statements will be deemed representations and not warranties. INCONTESTABILITY OF THIS POLICY There will be no contest of the validity of this Policy, except for not paying premiums, after it has been in force for two years from the Effective Date. No statement in any application, except a fraudulent statement, made by the Policyholder or by a person insured under this Policy shall be used in contesting the validity of his or her insurance or in denying a claim for a loss incurred after such insurance has been in force for two years during the person's lifetime. Note: There is no time limit with respect to a contest in connection with fraudulent statements. AMENDMENT This Policy may be amended, at any time, without the consent of the Covered Persons or of anyone else with a beneficial interest in it. This can be done through written request made by the Policyholder SEH 1/14 Page 14 and agreed to by Horizon BCBSNJ. Horizon BCBSNJ may also make amendments to this Policy, as provided in b. and c. below. Horizon BCBSNJ will give the Policyholder 30 days advance written notice. An amendment will not affect benefits for a service or supply furnished before the date of change. Only an officer of Horizon BCBSNJ has authority: to waive any conditions or restrictions of this Policy; or to extend the time in which a premium may be paid; or to make or change a Policy; or to bind Horizon BCBSNJ by a promise or representation or by information given or received. No change in this Policy is valid unless the change is shown in one of the following ways: a. It is shown in an endorsement on it signed by an officer of Horizon BCBSNJ. b.

Horizon BCBSNJ's written approval will include the starting date of the company's coverage under this Policy. But each eligible Employee of that company must still meet all the terms and conditions of this Policy before becoming covered. An Employee of the Policyholder and one or more Affiliated Companies will be considered an Employee of only one of those Employers for the purpose of this Policy. That Employee's service with multiple Employers will be treated as service with that one. The Policyholder must notify Horizon BCBSNJ in writing when a company stops being an Affiliated Company. As of this date, this Policy will be considered to end for Employees of that Employer. This applies to all of those Employees except those who, on the next day, are employed by the Policyholder or another Affiliated Company as eligible Employees. PREMIUM AMOUNTS The premium due on each premium due date is the sum of the premium charges for the coverage then provided. Those charges are determined from the premium rates then in effect and the Employees and Dependents then covered. Premium Refunds If one or more of the premiums paid include charges for an Employee and/or Dependent whose coverage has ended before the due date of that premium, any refund of premium will depend on whether the Employee contributed toward the premium payment or whether it was paid in full by the Policyholder. If the Employee contributed toward the premium payment, Horizon BCBSNJ will not refund the premium and coverage will continue in force through the end of the period for which premium has been contributed by the Employee. SEH 1/14 Page 15 If the premium was paid in full by the Policyholder, any refund of premium will depend on whether claims were incurred during the period of no more than two months for which refund is requested. If no claims have been incurred Horizon BCBSNJ will refund premiums paid for a maximum of two months prior to the date Horizon BCBSNJ receives written notice from the Policyholder that the Employee's and/ or Dependent's coverage has ended. If claims have been incurred during the period prior to Horizon BCBSNJ's receipt of written notice that the Employee and Dependent's coverage has ended, Horizon BCBSNJ shall not be required to refund premium to the Policyholder. PAYMENT OF PREMIUMS -GRACE PERIOD Premiums are to be paid by the Policyholder to Horizon BCBSNJ. Each may be paid at a Horizon BCBSNJ's office or to one of its authorized agents.

The Policyholder is liable to pay premiums to Horizon BCBSNJ for the time this Policy is in force. REINSTATEMENT If the premium has not been paid before the end of the grace period, this Policy automatically terminates as of the last day of the grace period. The Policyholder may make written request to the Horizon BCBSNJ that this Policy be reinstated. If the Horizon BCBSNJ accepts the request for reinstatement, the Policyholder must pay all unpaid premiums back to the date premium was last paid. Such payment is subject to the premium rate then in effect and to the payment of the reinstatement fee as established by the Horizon BCBSNJ.

PARTICIP ATION REQUIREMENTS At least 75% of the Employees eligible for insurance must be enrolled for coverage. If an eligible Employee is not covered by this Policy because: a) the Employee is covered as a Dependent under a spouse's coverage, other than individual coverage; SEH 1/14 Page 16 b) the Employee is covered under any fully -insured Health Benefits Plan issued by the same carrier offered by the Policyholder; c) the Employee is covered under Medicaid or NJ FamilyCare; d) the Employee is covered under Tricare; or e) the Employee is covered under another group health benefits plan. Horizon BCBSNJ will count this person as being covered by this Policy for the purposes of satisfying participation requirements. CLERICAL ERROR - MISSTATEMENTS Except as stated below, neither clerical error nor programming or systems error by the Policyholder, nor Horizon BCBSNJ in keeping any records pertaining to coverage under this Policy, nor delays in making entries thereon, will invalidate coverage which would otherwise be in force, or continue coverage which would otherwise be validly terminated. Upon discovery of such error or delay, an appropriate adjustment of premiums will be made, as permitted by law. Exception: If an Employee contributed toward the premium payment and coverage continued in force beyond the date it should have been validly terminated as a result of such error or delay, the continued coverage will remain in effect through the end of the period for which the Employee contributed toward the premium payment and no premium adjustment will be made. Premium adjustments involving return of unearned premium to the Policyholder for such errors or delays will be made only if the Employee did not contribute toward the premium payment. Except as stated in the Premium Refunds section of the Premium Amounts provision, such return of premium will be limited to the period of 12 months preceding the date of Horizon BCBSNJ's receipt of satisfactory evidence that such adjustments should be made. If the age or gender of an Employee is found to have been misstated, and the premiums are thereby affected, an equitable adjustment of premiums will be made.

The American Hospital Formulary Service Drug Information; or 2. The United States Pharmacopeia Drug Information recognize the usage as appropriate medical treatment. As an alternative to such recognition in one or more of the compendia, the usage of the drug will be recognized as appropriate if it is recommended by a clinical study or recommended by a review article in a major peer reviewed professional journal.

In any event, any drug which the Food and Drug Administration has determined to be contraindicated for the specific treatment for which the drug has been prescribed will be considered Experimental or Investigational. b. Conclusive evidence from the published peer-reviewed medical literature must exist that the technology has a definite positive effect on health outcomes; such evidence must include well designed investigations that have been reproduced by non affiliated authoritative sources, with measurable results, backed up by the positive endorsements of national medical bodies or panels regarding scientific efficacy and rationale; c. Demonstrated evidence as reflected in the published peer-reviewed medical literature must exist that over time the technology leads to improvement in health outcomes, i.e., the beneficial effects outweigh any harmful effects; d. Proof as reflected in the published peer-reviewed medical literature must exist that the technology is at least as effective in improving health outcomes as established technology, or is usable in appropriate clinical contexts in which established technology is not employable; and e. Proof as reflected in the published peer reviewed medical literature must exist that improvements in health outcomes; as defined item c. above, is possible in standard conditions of medical practice, outside clinical investigatory settings.

SEH 1/14 Page 38 EMPLOYEE COVERAGE Eligible Employees Subject to the Conditions of Eligibility set forth below, and to all of the other conditions of this Policy, all of the Policyholder's Employees who are in an eligible class will be eligible if the Employees are Actively at Work Full -Time Employees. In certain situations, the Actively at Work requirement will not apply. If an Employee is not Actively at Work due to a Health Status -Related Factor, the Employee will nevertheless be considered an Eligible Employee. In addition, refer to the Exception below. For purposes of this Policy, Horizon BCBSNJ will treat partners, proprietors and independent contractors like Employees if they meet this Policy's Conditions of Eligibility. Conditions of Eligibility Full-Time Requirement Except where an Employee is not Actively at Work due to a Health Status -Related Factor, and except as stated below, Horizon BCBSNJ will not insure an Employee unless the Employee is an Actively at Work a Full-Time Employee. Enrollment Requirement Horizon BCBSNJ will not insure the Employee until the Employee enrolls and agrees to make the required payments, if any. If the Employee does this within 30 days of the Employee's Eligibility Date, coverage is scheduled to start on the Employee's Eligibility Date. If the Employee enrolls and agrees to make the required payments, if any: a) more than 30 days after the Employee's Eligibility Date; or b) after the Employee previously had coverage which ended because the Employee failed to make a required payment. Horizon BCBSNJ will consider the Employee to be a Late Enrollee. Late enrollees may request enrollment during the Employee Open Enrollment Period. Coverage will take effect on the Policyholder's Policy Anniversary date following enrollment. Special Enrollment Rules When an Employee initially waives coverage under this Policy, the Plan Sponsor or Horizon BCBSNJ should notify the Employee of the requirement for the Employee to make a statement that waiver was because he or she was covered under another group plan, if such other coverage was in fact the reason for the waiver, and the consequences of that requirement. If an Employee initially waived coverage under this Policy and the Employee stated at that time that such waiver was because he or she was covered under another group plan, and Employee now elects to enroll under this Policy, Horizon BCBSNJ will not consider the Employee and his or her Dependents to be Late Enrollees, and will assign an effective date consistent with the provisions that follow provided the coverage under the other plan ends due to one of the following events: a) termination of employment or eligibility; b) reduction in the number of hours of employment; c) involuntary termination; d) divorce or legal separation or dissolution of the civil union; e) death of the Employee's spouse; SEH 1/14 Page 39 f) termination of the Employer's contribution toward coverage; or g) termination of the other plan's coverage. But, the Employee must enroll under this Policy within 90 days of the date that any of the events described above occur. Coverage will take effect as of the date the applicable event occurs. If an Employee initially waived coverage under this Policy because he or she had coverage under a Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation provision and the Employee requests coverage under this Policy within 30 days of the date the COBRA continuation ended, Horizon BCBSNJ will not consider the Employee to be a Late Enrollee. Coverage will take effect as of the date the COBRA continuation ended. In addition, an Employee and any Dependents will not be considered Late Enrollees if the Employee is employed by an employer which offers multiple Health Benefits Plans and the Employee elects a different plan during the open enrollment period. Further, an Employee and his or her Dependent spouse, if any, will not be considered Late Enrollees because the Employee initially waived coverage under this Policy for himself or herself and any then existing Dependents provided the Employee enrolls to cover himself or herself and his or her existing Dependent spouse, if any, under this Policy within 30 days of the marriage, birth, adoption or placement for adoption of a Newly Acquired Dependent. If an Employee or any Dependent experiences a Triggering Event the Employee and Dependents may elect to enroll during the Special Enrollment Period that follows the Triggering Event. The election period is generally the 30 day period following the Triggering Event. If the Triggering Event is losing or gaining eligibility for Medicaid or NJ Family Care, the election period is 60 days. If the Triggering Event is marriage, birth, adoption, placement for adoption, or placement in foster care, coverage will take effect as of the date of the marriage, birth, adoption, placement for adoption, or placement in foster care. For all other Triggering Events, coverage will take effect as of the first of the month following receipt of the enrollment form. The Waiting Period This Policy has the following Waiting Periods: Employees in an Eligible Class on the Effective Date, who have completed at least 1 month of continuous Full-Time service with the Policyholder by that date, are covered under this Policy from the Effective Date. Employees in an Eligible Class on the Effective Date, who have not completed at least 1 month of continuous Full-Time service with the Policyholder by that date, are eligible for coverage under this Policy from the day after Employees complete 1 month of continuous Full-Time service. Employees who enter an Eligible Class after the Effective Date are eligible for coverage under this Policy from the day after Employees complete 2 month of continuous Full-Time service with the Policyholder. Any lapse in continuous service due to an absence which results from a Health Status -Related factor will reduce the days of Full-Time service by the number of days of absence. Such lapse in continuous Full-Time service will not require that the period of continuous Full-Time service begin anew. SEH 1/14 Page 40 Multiple Employment If an Employee works for both the Policyholder and a covered Affiliated Company, or for more than one covered Affiliated Company, Horizon BCBSNJ will treat the Employee as if only one entity employs the Employee. And such an Employee will not have multiple coverage under this Policy. But, if this Policy uses the amount of an Employee's earnings or number of work hours to determine class, or for any other reason, such Employee's earnings or number of work hours will be figured as the sum of his or her earnings or work hours from all Affiliated Companies. When Employee Coverage Starts Except where an Employee is not Actively at Work due to a Health Status -Related Factor, and except as stated below, an Employee must be Actively at Work, and working his or her regular number of hours, on the date his or her coverage is scheduled to start. And he or she must have met all the conditions of eligibility which apply to him or her. If an Employee is not Actively at Work on the scheduled Effective Date, and does not qualify for the exception to the Actively at Work requirement, Horizon BCBSNJ will postpone the start of his or her coverage until he or she returns to Active Work. Sometimes, a scheduled Effective Date is not a regularly scheduled work day. But an Employee's coverage will start on that date if he or she was Actively at Work, and working his or her regular number of hours, on his or her last regularly scheduled work day. The Employee must elect to enroll and agree to make the required payments, if any, within 30 days of the Employee's Eligibility Date. If he or she does this within 30 days of the Employee's Eligibility Date, his or her coverage is scheduled to start on the Employee's Eligibility Date. Such Employee's Eligibility Date is the Effective Date of an Employee's coverage. If the Employee does this more than 30 days after the Employee's Eligibility Date, Horizon BCBSNJ will consider the Employee a Late Enrollee. The Employee may request enrollment during the Employee Open Enrollment period. Coverage will take effect on the Policyholder's Anniversary date following enrollment. EXCEPTION to the Actively at Work Requirement The Exception applies if the Policyholder who purchased this Policy purchased it to replace a plan the Policyholder had with some other carrier. An Employee who is not Actively at Work due to Total Disability on the date this Policy takes effect will initially be eligible for limited coverage under this Policy if: a) the Employee was validly covered under the Policyholder's old plan on the date the Policyholder's old plan ended; and b) this Policy takes effect immediately upon termination of the prior plan. Except as stated below, the coverage under this Policy will be limited to coverage for services or supplies for conditions other than the disabling condition. Such limited coverage under this Policy will end one year from the date the person's coverage under this Policy begins. Coverage for services or supplies for the disabling condition will be provided as stated in an extended health benefits, or like provision, contained in the Policyholder's old plan. Thereafter, coverage will not be limited as described in this provision, but will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy. Exception: If the coverage under this Policy is richer than the coverage under the Policyholder's old plan, this Policy will provide coverage for services and supplies related to the disabling condition. This Policy will coordinate with the Policyholder's old plan, with this Policy providing secondary coverage, as described in the Coordination of Benefits and Services provision SEH 1/14 Page 41 When Employee Coverage Ends An Employee's insurance under this Policy will end on the first of the following dates: a) the date an Employee ceases to be an Actively at Work a Full-Time Employee for any reason. Such reasons include death, retirement, lay-off, leave of absence, and the end of employment. b) the date an Employee stops being an eligible Employee under this Policy. c) the date this Policy ends, or is discontinued for a class of Employees to which the Employee belongs. d) the last day of the period for which required payments are made for the Employee, subject to the Payment of Premiums - Grace Period section. SEH 1/14 Page 42 DEPENDENT COVERAGE Policyholder Election A Policyholder that elects to make Dependent coverage available under this Policy may choose to make coverage available for all eligible Dependents, as defined below or may choose to make coverage available only for Dependent Children. If the Policyholder limits Dependent coverage to Dependent Children, the term \"Dependent\" as used in this Policy is limited to Dependent Children. Eligible Dependents for Dependent Health Benefits An Employee's eligible Dependents are the Employee's: a) legal spouse which shall include a civil union partner pursuant to P.L. 2006, c. 103 as well as same sex relationships legally recognized in other jurisdictions when such relationships provide substantially all of the rights and benefits of marriage; except that legal spouse shall be limited to spouses of a marriage as marriage is defined in Federal law with respect to: the provisions of this Policy regarding continuation rights required by the Federal Consolidated Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA), Pub. L. 99-272, as subsequently amended) the provisions of this Policy regarding Medicare Eligibility by reason of Age and Medicare Eligibility by Reason of Disability. b) Dependent children who are under age 26. Note : If the Policyholder elects to limit coverage to Dependent Children, the term Dependent excludes a legal spouse. Under certain circumstances, an incapacitated child is also a Dependent. See the Incapacitated Children section of this Policy. An Employee's \"Dependent child\" includes: a) his or her legally adopted children, b) his or her step-child, c) his or her foster child, d) the child of his or her civil union partner, and e) children under a court appointed guardianship. Horizon BCBSNJ treats a child as legally adopted from the time the child is placed in the home for purpose of adoption. Horizon BCBSNJ treats such a child this way whether or not a final adoption order is ever issued. Incapacitated Children An Employee may have an unmarried child with a mental or physical incapacity, or Developmental Disability, who is incapable of earning a living. Subject to all of the terms of this section andthis Policy, such a child may stay eligible for Dependent health benefits past this Policy's age limit for eligible Dependents. The child will stay eligible as long as the child stays unmarried and incapable of earning a living, if: a) the child's condition started before he or she reached this Policy's age limit; b) the child became insured by this Policy or any other policy before the child reached the age limit and stayed continuously insured after reaching such limit; and c) the child depends on the Employee for most of his or her support and maintenance. SEH 1/14 Page 43 But, for the child to stay eligible, the Employee must send Horizon BCBSNJ written proof that the child is incapacitated or Developmentally Disabled and depends on the Employee for most of his or her support and maintenance. The Employee has 31 days from the date the child reaches the age limit to do this. Horizon BCBSNJ can ask for periodic proof that the child's condition continues. But, after two years, Horizon BCBSNJ cannot ask for this more than once a year. The child's coverage ends when the Employee's coverage ends. Enrollment Requirement An Employee must enroll his or her eligible Dependents in order for them to be covered under this Policy. Horizon BCBSNJ considers an eligible Dependent to be a Late Enrollee, if the Employee: a) enrolls a Dependent and agrees to make the required payments more than 30 days after the Dependent's Eligibility Date; b) in the case of a Newly Acquired Dependent, has other eligible Dependents whose coverage previously ended because the Employee failed to make the required contributions, or otherwise chose to end such coverage. If the Employee's dependent coverage ends for any reason, including failure to make the required payments, his or her Dependents will be considered Late Enrollees when their coverage begins again. When an Employee initially waives coverage for a spouse and/or eligible Dependent children under this Policy, the Plan Sponsor or Horizon BCBSNJ should notify the Employee of the requirement for the Employee to make a statement that waiver was because the spouse and/or eligible Dependent children were covered under another group plan, if such other coverage was in fact the reason for the waiver, and the consequences of that requirement. If the Employee previously waived coverage for the Employee's spouse or eligible Dependent children under this Policy and stated at that time that, such waiver was because they were covered under another group plan and the Employee now elects to enroll them in this Policy, the Dependent will not be considered a Late Enrollee, provided the Dependent's coverage under the other plan ends due to one of the following events: a) termination of employment or eligibility; b) reduction in the number of hours of employment; c) involuntary termination; d) divorce or legal separation or dissolution of the civil union; e) death of the Employee's spouse; f) termination of the contribution toward coverage that was being made by the employer that offered the group plan under which the Dependent was covered; or g) termination of the other plan's coverage. But, the Employee's spouse or eligible Dependent children must be enrolled by the Employee within 90 days of the date that any of the events described above occur. Coverage will take effect as of the date the applicable event occurs. And, Horizon BCBSNJ will not consider an Employee's spouse or eligible Dependent children for which the Employee initially waived coverage under this Policy, to be a Late Enrollee, if: a) the Employee is under legal obligation to provide coverage due to a court order; and b) the Employee's spouse or eligible Dependent children are enrolled by the Employee within 30 days of the issuance of the court order. Coverage will take effect as of the date required pursuant to a court order. SEH 1/14 Page 44 In addition, if an Employee initially waived coverage under this Policy for the Employee's spouse or eligible Dependent children because the spouse and/or Dependent children had coverage under a Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) continuation provision and the Employee requests coverage for the spouse and/or Dependent children under this Policy within 30 days of the date the COBRA continuation ended, Horizon BCBSNJ will not consider the spouse and/or Dependent children to be Late Enrollees. Coverage will take effect as of the date the COBRA continuation ended. When Dependent Coverage Starts In order for an Employee's dependent coverage to begin the Employee must already be insured for Employee coverage or enroll for Employee and Dependent coverage at the same time. Subject to all of the terms of this Policy, the date an Employee's dependent coverage starts depends on when the Employee elects to enroll the Employee's Initial Dependents and agrees to make any required payments. If the Employee does this within 30 days of the Dependent's Eligibility Date, the Dependent's Coverage is scheduled to start on the later of: a) the Dependent's Eligibility Date, or b) the date the Employee becomes insured for Employee coverage. If the Employee does this more than 30 days after the Dependent's Eligibility Date, Horizon BCBSNJ will consider the Dependent a Late Enrollee. An Employee may elect to cover a Dependent who is a Late Enrollee during the Employee Open Enrollment Period. Coverage will take effect on the Policyholder's Policy Anniversary date following enrollment. Once an Employee has dependent coverage for Initial Dependents the Employee must notify Horizon BCBSNJ of a Newly Acquired Dependent within 30 days after the Newly Acquired Dependent's Eligibility Date. If the Employee does not, the Newly Acquired Dependent is a Late Enrollee. A Newly Acquired Dependent other than a newborn child or newly adopted child, including a child placed for adoption, will be covered from the later of: a) the date the Employee notifies Horizon BCBSNJ and agrees to make any additional payments, or b) the Dependent's Eligibility Date for the Newly Acquired Dependent. If the Policyholder who purchased this Policy purchased it to replace a plan the Policyholder had with some other carrier, a Dependent who is Totally Disabled on the date this Policy takes effect will initially be eligible for limited coverage under this Policy if: a) the Dependent was validly covered under the Policyholder's old plan on the date the Policyholder's old plan ended; and b) this Policy takes effect immediately upon termination of the prior plan. The coverage under this Policy will be limited to coverage for services or supplies for conditions other than the disabling condition. Such limited coverage under this Policy will end one year from the date the person's coverage under this Policy begins. Coverage for services or supplies for the disabling condition will be provided as stated in an extended health benefits, or like provision, contained in the Policyholder's old plan. Thereafter coverage will not be limited as described in this provision, but will be subject to the terms and conditions of this Policy. Newborn Children Horizon BCBSNJ will cover an Employee's newborn child for 31 days from the date of birth without additional premium. Health benefits may be continued beyond such 31-day period as stated below: a) If the Employee is already covered for Dependent child coverage on the date the child is born, coverage automatically continues beyond the initial 31 days, provided the premium required for SEH 1/14 Page 45 Dependent child coverage continues to be paid..The Employee must notify Horizon BCBSNJ of the birth of the newborn child as soon as possible in order that Horizon BCBSNJ may properly provide benefits under this Policy. b) If the Employee is not covered for Dependent child coverage on the date the child is born, the Employee must: give written notice to enroll the newborn child; and pay the premium required for Dependent child coverage within 31 days after the date of birth. If the notice is not given and the premium is not paid within such 31-day period, the newborn child's coverage will end at the end of such 31-day period. If the notice is given and the premium paid after that 31-day period, the child will be a Late Enrollee. When Dependent Coverage Ends A Dependent's insurance under this Policy will end on the first of the following dates: a) the date Employee coverage ends; b) the date the Employee stops being a member of a class of Employees eligible for such coverage; c) the date this Policy ends; d) the date Dependent coverage is terminated from this Policy for all Employees or for an Employee's class. e) the date an Employee fails to pay any required part of the cost of Dependent coverage. It ends on the last day of the period for which the Employee made the required payments, unless coverage ends earlier for other reasons. f) at 12:01 a.m. on the date the Dependent stops being an eligible Dependent. SEH 1/14 Page 46 EXCLUSIVE PROVIDER ORGANIZATION (EPO) PROVISIONS Definitions a) Primary Care Provider (PCP) means the Practitioner the Covered Person selects to supervise and coordinate his or her health care in the Horizon Managed Care Network Provider Organization. Horizon BCBSNJ will supply the Covered Person with a list of PCPs who are members of the Horizon Managed Care Network Provider Organization. A female Covered Person may visit her OB/GYN without supervision or coordination from the PCP. b) Provider Organization (PO) means a network of health care Providers located in a Covered Person's Service Area. c) Service Area means the geographical area which is served by the Practitioners in the Horizon Managed Care Network Provider Organization. Provider Organization (PO) The Provider Organization for this Policy is the Horizon Managed Care Network (MCN) Provider Organization.

Except in the case of Urgent Care or a medical Emergency, a Covered person must obtain covered services and supplies from Network PO Providers to receive benefits under this Policy. Services and supplies obtained from Providers that are not Network PO Providers will generally not be covered. The Primary Care Provider (PCP) Under this Policy a Covered person does not have to select a PCP, but is encouraged to do so. If selected, the PCP will supervise and coordinate the Covered Person's health care in the Horizon Managed Care Network PO for example, by providing referrals to specialists. Even if a PCP is selected, a Covered person can choose any specialist he or she wants to use. But if a Covered Person goes to a Practitioner other than a selected PCP a higher copayment will generally apply. A Covered Person who has selected a PCP may change his or her PCP to another PCP once per month. He or she may select another PCP from the list of Practitioners, and notify Horizon Managed Care Network PO by phone or in writing. For a discretionary change, the new PCP selection will take effect no more than 14 days following the date of the request. For a change necessitated by termination of the prior PCP from the Network, the new PCP selection will take effect immediately. When a Covered Person uses the services of a PCP, he or she must present his or her ID card and pay the Copayment. When a Covered Person's PCP refers him or her to another Horizon Managed Care Network PO Provider, the Covered Person must pay the Copayment to such Provider. Most Horizon Managed Care Network PO Practitioners will prepare any necessary claim forms and submit them to Horizon BCBSNJ. Emergency Services In the case of Urgent Care or an Emergency, a Covered Person may go to a Horizon Managed Care Network provider or a non-Horizon Managed Care Network provider. If a Covered Person receives Urgent Care or care and treatment for an Emergency from a non-Horizon Managed Care Network provider, and the Covered Person calls Horizon BCBSNJ within 48 hours, or as soon as reasonably possible, Horizon BCBSNJ will provide benefits for the Urgent Care or Emergency care and treatment to the same extent as would have been provided if care and treatment were provided by a Horizon Managed Care Network provider. However, follow -up care or treatment by a non-Horizon Managed Care Network provider will be treated as Network Benefits only to the extent it is Medically Necessary and SEH 1/14 Page 47 Appropriate care or treatment rendered before the Covered Person can return to the Horizon Managed Care Network service area. Service Area The Service Area is the State of New Jersey. Different providers in Horizon BCBSNJ Network have agreed to be paid in different ways by Horizon BCBSNJ. A Provider may be paid each time he or she treats a Covered Person (\"fee for service\", or may be paid a set fee for each month for each Covered Person whether or not the Covered Person actually receives services (\"capitation\"). These payment methods may include financial incentive agreements to pay some providers more (\"bonuses\") or less (\"withholds\") based on many factors: Covered Person satisfaction, quality of care, and control of costs and use of services among them. If a Covered Person desires additional information about how Horizon BCBSNJ's primary care physicians or any other Provider in Horizon BCBSNJ's Network are compensated, please call Horizon BCBSNJ at 1-800-355-2583 or write Horizon BCBSNJ, PO Box 1609, Newark, NJ 07101.

Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination: An Adverse Benefit Determination: (a) that has been upheld by Horizon BCBSNJ at the completion of the internal review process; (b) with respect to which Horizon BCBSNJ has waived its right to conduct an internal review; (c) for which Horizon BCBSNJ did not fully comply with internal appeals process requirements within the regulations promulgated by the State of New Jersey; or (d) for which the Covered Person or his/her Provider has applied for an expedited external review at the same time as applying for an expedited internal review. Post -service Claim: Any Claim for a benefit that is not a Pre- service Claim. Pre-service Claim: Any Claim for a benefit with respect to which the terms of the plan condition receipt of the benefit, in whole or in part, on its approval in advance of obtaining medical care. Rescission: A cancellation or discontinuance of coverage that has a retroactive effect. This does not include a loss of coverage due to a failure to timely pay: (a) required premiums; or (b) contributions to the cost of the coverage. Urgent Care Claim: A Claim for medical care or treatment with respect to which application of the time periods for making a non-urgent determination: (a) could, in the judgment of a prudent layperson possessing an average knowledge of health and medicine, seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Covered Person, or the ability of the Covered Person to regain maximum function; or SEH 1/14 Page 49 (b) would, in the opinion of a physician with knowledge of the Covered Person's medical condition, subject him/her to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the care or treatment that is the subject of the claim. Time Frame for Initial ABDs A Covered Person shall be notified of Horizon BCBSNJ's initial Adverse Benefit Determination as quickly as possible based on the medical circumstances, but in no event later than: (a) 72 hours from receipt of an Urgent Care Claim; (b) 15 days from receipt of a Pre-service Claim; or (c) 30 days from receipt of a Post-service Claim. Horizon BCBSNJ will provide written notice of the decision within two business days and will include an explanation of the applicable appeals process. A Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) may appeal Horizon BCBSNJ's ABD, as described below. No Covered Person or Provider who files an appeal will be subject to disenrollment, discrimination or penalty by Horizon BCBSNJ. Appeals Procedure for ABD- Benefits A Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) may appeal an ABD-Benefits. Such an appeal must be filed within 180 days from the date of the ABD. The appeal process for a ABD-Benefits consists of: (a) an informal internal review by Horizon BCBSNJ; and (b) if the initial decision is upheld, a formal second level internal review by Horizon BCBSNJ. A Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) can appeal an ABD-Benefits by calling or writing Horizon BCBSNJ at the telephone number or address on the Covered Person's ID card. The Covered Person must include the following information: 1) the name(s) and address(es) of the Covered Person(s) or Provider(s) involved; 2) the Covered Person's ID number; 3) the date(s) of service; 4) the details regarding the actions in question; 5) the nature of and reason behind the appeal; 6) the remedy sought; and 7) the documentation to support the appeal. Following the plan's review of the appeal, if the initial ABD-Benefits is upheld, the Covered Person, if still dissatisfied, can file an appeal for a formal second level review that will be decided by Horizon BCBSNJ professionals who were not involved in the prior decisions. All ABD- Benefits denials include a written explanation of the appeals process with instructions on how to proceed to the next level of the appeals process. SEH 1/14 Page 50 The time frames for deciding appeals for ABD-Benefits are as follows: (a) For ABD-Benefits involving: an Urgent Care Claim; an Inpatient admission; the availability of medical care; the continuation of an Inpatient Facility stay; or a Claim for medical services for a Covered Person who has received emergency care, but who has not been discharged from a Facility: 72 hours. (b) For all other ABD-Benefits: 15 calendar days for Pre-service Claims; 30 calendar days for Post- service Claims. The same time frames apply for the formal second level internal review. For each level of appeal, Horizon BCBSNJ will provide the Covered Person and/or the Provider with notice of the outcome, and if the ABD- Benefits is upheld, instructions for filing for the next level of review. If the initial ABD-Benefits is upheld through both levels of the internal review process, no further remedies are available from Horizon BCBSNJ. In this event, Horizon BCBSNJ will provide the Covered Person with information regarding the availability of and contact information for the consumer assistance program of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. The Department's address and phone number appear below in subsection d. of the following section. Appeals Procedure for ABD- Medical A Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) may appeal an ABD- Medical. The appeal process for Adverse Benefit Determinations involving medical judgment (ABD-Medical) consists of: (a) an informal Stage 1 internal review by Horizon BCBSNJ; (b) a formal Stage 2 internal review by Horizon BCBSNJ; and (c) a formal external review by an Independent Utilization Review Organization (IURO). The initial appeal must be filed within 180 days after Horizon BCBSNJ's initial ABD-Medical. Any ABD- Medical will be culturally and linguistically appropriate and will include the following timely information: 1) Information identifying the claim involved, including: the date of service; the health care Provider; the claim amount (if applicable); and a statement about the availability, upon request, of the diagnosis and treatment codes, and their corresponding meaning. 2) The reason(s) for the denial, including: the denial code and its meaning; and a description of the standard used by Horizon BCBSNJ in the denial. 3) Information regarding the availability of, and contact information for, the consumer assistance program of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. (The Department's address and phone number appear below in subsection d.) Also, Horizon BCBSNJ will timely provide to the Covered Person and/or the Provider acting on his/her behalf, free of charge, any new or additional evidence or rationale, however generated, that Horizon BCBSNJ will rely upon, consider or use in connection with an ABD-Medical. Except as otherwise provided below, a Covered Person must follow the steps for filing the three levels of appeal. If these steps are not followed, the Covered Person's appeal review may be delayed or forfeited. SEH 1/14 Page 51 a. First Level Appeal - Stage 1 A Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) can file a First Level Stage 1 Appeal by calling or writing Horizon BCBSNJ at the telephone number and address on the Covered Person's ID card. At the First Level Appeal, a Covered Person may discuss the ABD-Medical directly with the Horizon BCBSNJ physician who made it, or with the medical director designated by Horizon BCBSNJ. To submit a First Level Appeal, the Covered Person must include the following information: 1) the name(s) and address(es) of the Covered Person(s) or Provider(s) involved; 2) the Covered Person's ID number; 3) the date(s) of service; 4) the details regarding the actions in question; 5) the nature of and reason behind the appeal; 6) the remedy sought; and 7) the documentation to support the appeal. Horizon BCBSNJ will decide First Level Appeals within 72 hours in the case of an ABD-Medical involving: a) an Urgent Care Claim or an Emergency, b) an Inpatient admission; c) the availability of medical care; d) the continuation of an Inpatient Facility stay; or e) a Claim for medical services for a Covered Person who has received emergency care, but who has not been discharged from a Facility. Horizon BCBSNJ will decide all other First Level Stage 1 ABD- Medical Appeals within ten calendar days of receipt of the required documentation. Horizon BCBSNJ will provide the Covered Person and/or the Provider with: (a) written notice of the outcome; (b) the reasons for the decision; and (c) if the initial ABD- Medical is upheld, instructions for filing a Second Level Stage 2 Appeal. b. Second Level Appeal - Stage 2 If a Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) is not satisfied with Horizon BCBSNJ's First Level Appeal decision, the Covered Person or Provider can file for, orally or in writing, a Second Level Stage 2 Appeal of the ABD-Medical to be decided by a panel of physicians and/or other health care professionals selected by Horizon BCBSNJ who were not involved in the original and First Level Appeal decisions. The panel shall have access to consultant Practitioners who are trained or who practice in the same specialty that would typically manage the case at issue being appealed. Upon the Covered Person's or Provider's request, such Consultant Practitioners will participate in the Second Level Stage 2 Appeal. SEH 1/14 Page 52 Horizon BCBSNJ will acknowledge the filing of Second Level Appeals in writing within ten business days of receipt and include instructions regarding the scheduling and how to participate in the Second Level Stage 2 Appeal hearing. Following the hearing, Horizon BCBSNJ will then provide written notice of the final decision on the appeal within 72 hours in the case of an ABD- Medical involving: (a) an Urgent Care Claim or an Emergency, (b) an Inpatient admission; (c) the availability of medical care; (d) the continuation of an Inpatient Facility stay; or (e) a Claim for medical services for a Covered Person who has received emergency care, but who has not been discharged from a Facility. Horizon BCBSNJ will decide all other Second Level Stage 2 Appeals of ABD-Medical within 20 business days. If the Second Level Appeal is denied, Horizon BCBSNJ will provide the Covered Person and/or Provider with written notice of the reasons for the denial, together with a written notice of his/her right to proceed to an external appeal. Horizon BCBSNJ will include: (a) specific instructions as to how the Covered Person and/or Provider may arrange for such an external appeal; and (b) any forms needed to start the appeal. c. Right to Waive Horizon BCBSNJ's Internal Appeal Procedure In certain circumstances, a Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) may not have to complete Horizon BCBSNJ's internal appeals process with respect to an ABD-Medical, and may proceed directly to the external appeal process described below, if: (a) Horizon BCBSNJ does not meet a time frame described above for the First and Second Level Appeals; (b) Horizon BCBSNJ waives its right to an internal review; or (c) the Covered Person or his/her Provider has applied for an expedited external review at the same time as applying for an expedited internal review. With respect to (a), above, this right to proceed to the external appeal without completing the internal appeals process will not apply if Horizon BCBSNJ can show that: (a) the violation did not cause, and is not likely to cause, prejudice or harm to the Covered Person and/or Provider; (b) the violation was for a good reason or due to matters beyond Horizon BCBSNJ's control; (c) the violation occurred in the context of an ongoing, good faith exchange of information between Horizon BCBSNJ and the Covered Person and/or Provider; and (d) the violation is not reflective of a pattern or practice of non-compliance by Horizon BCBSNJ. If Horizon BCBSNJ claims this exception, the Covered Person or his/her Provider may ask for a written explanation of the violation from Horizon BCBSNJ. Horizon BCBSNJ must then provide the explanation within ten calendar days. It must include a description of the basis for the assertion that the violation should not cause the internal process to be waived. Questions regarding this exception shall be decided by an external reviewer. If it is determined that Horizon BCBSNJ meets the standard for the exception to part (a), the Covered Person and/or his/her Provider may then resubmit and pursue the internal appeal. Horizon BCBSNJ will then, within ten calendar days after that determination, notify the Covered Person and/or his/her SEH 1/14 Page 53 Provider of that right. The time frame for refiling the Claim will start upon the Covered Person's and/or Provider's receipt of the notice. d. External Appeal A Covered Person (or a Provider acting for the Covered Person, with the Covered Person's consent) who is dissatisfied with the results of Horizon BCBSNJ's internal appeal process with respect to a ABD- Medical can pursue an external appeal with an IURO assigned by the State of New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (the DOBI). Except as otherwise described above under part (c), the Covered Person's right to such an appeal depends on the Covered Person's full compliance with both stages of Horizon BCBSNJ's internal appeal process. To start an external appeal, the Covered Person or Provider must submit a written request within four months from receipt of Horizon BCBSNJ's Final Internal Adverse Benefit Determination (or within four months from the date of an occurrence described in (a), (b) or (c) under \"Right to Waive Horizon BCBSNJ's Internal Appeals Procedure\", above). The Covered Person or Provider must use the required forms and include both: (a) a $25.00 check made payable to \"New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance\"; and (b) an executed release to enable the IURO to obtain all medical records pertinent to the appeal, to: New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance Consumer Protection Services Office of Managed Care P.O. Box 329 Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0329 (888) 393-1062 The $25.00 fee will be refunded to the Covered Person or the Provider if the IURO reverses Horizon BCBSNJ's ABD-Medical decision. If the Covered Person cannot afford to pay the fee, the fee will be waived if the Covered Person can show proof of financial hardship. Proof of financial hardship can be demonstrated through evidence that one or more members of the household are receiving aid or benefits under: Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Aged and Disabled; Medicaid; General Assistance; Social Security Insurance; NJ FamilyCare; or the New Jersey Unemployment Assistance program. Annual filing fees for any one Covered Person shall not exceed $75.00. Upon receipt of the request for the appeal, together with the executed release and the appropriate fee, if any, the DOBI shall immediately assign the appeal to an IURO to conduct a preliminary review and accept it for processing. But this will happen only if the IURO finds that: 1. the person is or was a Covered Person of Horizon BCBSNJ; 2. the service or supply which is the subject of the appeal reasonably appears to be a Covered Service or Supply under the Covered Person's Program; and 3. the Covered Person has furnished all information needed by the IURO and the DOBI to make the preliminary determination. This includes: the appeal form; a copy of any information furnished by Horizon BCBSNJ regarding its Final Adverse Benefit Determination; and the fully executed release. SEH 1/14 Page 54 Upon completion of this review, the IURO will immediately inform the Covered Person or Provider, in writing, as to whether or not the appeal has been accepted for review. If it is not accepted, the IURO will give the reasons. If the appeal is accepted, the IURO will notify the Covered Person and/or his/her Provider of the right to submit in writing, within five business days, any further information to be considered in the review. The IURO will provide Horizon BCBSNJ with any such information within one business day after its receipt. The IURO will complete its review and issue its decision in writing within 45 calendar days from its receipt of the request for the review. But that time frame will be reduced to 48 hours if the appeal involves any of the following: (a) An Urgent Care Claim or an Emergency (b) An Inpatient admission. (c) The availability of medical care. (d) The continuation of an Inpatient Facility stay. (e) A Claim for medical services for a Covered Person who has received emergency care, but who has not been discharged from a Facility. (f) A medical condition for which the standard time frame would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the Covered Person or his/her ability to regain normal function. When the IURO completes its review, it will state its findings in writing and make a determination of whether Horizon BCBSNJ's denial, reduction, or termination of benefits deprived the Covered Person of Medically Necessary and Appropriate treatment. If a decision made within 48 hours was not in writing, the IURO will provide a written confirmation within 48 hours after the verbal decision. If the IURO determines that the denial, reduction, or termination of benefits deprived the Covered Person of Medically Necessary and Appropriate treatment, this will be conveyed to the Covered Person and/or Provider and Horizon BCBSNJ. The IURO will also describe the Medically Necessary and Appropriate services that should be received. This determination is binding upon Horizon BCBSNJ and the Covered Person, except to the extent that other remedies are available to either party under state or federal law. If all or part of the IURO's decision is in favor of the Covered Person, Horizon BCBSNJ will provide coverage for those Covered Services and Supplies that are determined to be Medically Necessary and Appropriate. This will be done without delay even if Horizon BCBSNJ intends to seek a judicial review or other remedies. And within ten business days of its receipt of a decision in favor of the Covered Person, (or sooner, if the medical facts of the case indicate a more rapid response), Horizon BCBSNJ will send a written report to: the IURO; the Covered Person and/or Provider; and the DOBI that describes how Horizon BCBSNJ will implement the IURO's determination. SEH 1/14 Page 55 CONTINUATION OF CARE Horizon BCBSNJ shall provide written notice to each Covered Person at least 30 business days prior to the termination or withdrawal from Horizon BCBSNJ's Provider network of a Covered Person's PCP and any other Provider from which the Covered Person is currently receiving a course of treatment, as reported to Horizon BCBSNJ. The 30-day prior notice may be waived in cases of immediate termination of a health care professional based on a breach of contract by the health care professional, a determination of fraud, or where Horizon BCBSNJ's medical director is of the opinion that the health care professional is an imminent danger to the patient or the public health, safety or welfare. Horizon BCBSNJ shall assure continued coverage of covered services at the contract rate by a terminated health care professional for up to four months in cases where it is Medically Necessary and Appropriate for the Covered Person to continue treatment with the terminated health care professional. In case of pregnancy of a Covered Person, coverage of services for the terminated health care professional shall continue to the postpartum evaluation of the Covered Person, up to six weeks after the delivery. With respect to pregnancy, Medical Necessity and Appropriateness shall be deemed to have been demonstrated. For a Covered Person who is receiving post-operative follow -up care, Horizon BCBSNJ shall continue to cover the services rendered by the health care professional for the duration of the treatment or for up to six months, whichever occurs first. For a Covered Person who is receiving oncological treatment or psychiatric treatment, Horizon BCBSNJ shall continue to cover services rendered by the health care professional for the duration of the treatment or for up to 12 months, whichever occurs first. For a Covered Person receiving the above services in an acute care Facility, Horizon BCBSNJ will continue to provide coverage for services rendered by the health care professional regardless of whether the acute care Facility is under contract or agreement with Horizon BCBSNJ. Services shall be provided to the same extent as provided while the health care professional was employed by or under contact with Horizon BCBSNJ. Reimbursement for services shall be pursuant to the same schedule used to reimburse the health care professional while the health care professional was employed by or under contract with Horizon BCBSNJ. If a Covered Person is admitted to a health care Facility on the date this Policy is terminated, Horizon BCBSNJ shall continue to provide benefits for the Covered Person until the date the Covered Person is discharged from the facility or exhaustion of the Covered Person's benefits under this Policy, whichever occurs first. Horizon BCBSNJ shall not continue services in those instances in which the health care professional has been terminated based upon the opinion of Horizon BCBSNJ's medical director that the health care professional is an imminent danger to a patient or to the public health, safety and welfare, a determination of fraud or a breach of contract by a health care professional. The determination of the Medical Necessity and Appropriateness of a Covered Person's continued treatment with a health care professional shall be subject to the appeal procedures set forth in this Policy. Horizon BCBSNJ shall not be liable for any inappropriate treatment provided to a Covered Person by a health care professional who is no longer employed by or under contract with Horizon BCBSNJ. If Horizon BCBSNJ refers a Covered Person to a Non-Network provider, the service or supply shall be covered as a network service or supply. Horizon BCBSNJ is fully responsible for payment to the SEH 1/14 Page 56 health care professional and the Covered Person's liability shall be limited to any applicable Network Copayment, Coinsurance or Deductible for the service or supply. SEH 1/14 Page 57 HEALTH BENEFITS INSURANCE This health benefits insurance will pay many of the medical expenses incurred by a Covered Person. Note: Horizon BCBSNJ payments will be reduced if a Covered Person does not comply with the Utilization Review and Pre-Approval requirements contained in this Policy. BENEFIT PROVISION The Schedule lists Copayments, Deductible Amounts, and/or Coinsurance as well as Maximum Out of Pocket Amounts. These terms are explained below. The Cash Deductible Each Calendar Year, each Covered Person must have Covered Charges that exceed the Cash Deductible before Horizon BCBSNJ pays any benefits to that person. The Cash Deductible is shown in the Schedule. The Cash Deductible cannot be met with Non -Covered Charges Only Covered Charges incurred by the Covered Person while insured by this Policy can be used to meet this Cash Deductible. Once the Cash Deductible is met, Horizon BCBSNJ pays benefits for other Covered Charges above the Cash Deductible incurred by that Covered Person, less any applicable Coinsurance or Copayments, for the rest of that Calendar Year. But all charges must be incurred while that Covered Person is insured by this Policy. And what Horizon BCBSNJ pays is based on all the terms of this Policy. Family Deductible Limit The Family Deductible is a cumulative Deductible for all family members for each Calendar Year. Network Maximum Out of Pocket Network Maximum Out of Pocket means the annual maximum dollar amount that a Covered Person must pay as Copayment, Deductible and Coinsurance for all Network covered services and supplies in a Calendar Year. All amounts paid as Copayment, Deductible and Coinsurance shall count toward the Network Maximum Out of Pocket. Once the Network Maximum Out of Pocket has been reached, the Covered Person has no further obligation to pay any amounts as Copayment, Deductible and Coinsurance for Network covered services and supplies for the remainder of the Calendar Year. Once any combination of Covered Persons in a family meet an amount equal to two times the individual Maximum Out of Pocket, no Covered Person in that family will be required to pay any amounts as Copayments, Deductible or Coinsurance for covered services and supplies for the remainder of the Calendar Year. Payment Limits Horizon BCBSNJ limits what Horizon BCBSNJ will pay for certain types of charges. See the Schedule for these limits. Benefits From Other Plans The benefits Horizon BCBSNJ will pay may be affected by a Covered Person's being covered by two or more plans or policies. Read the provision Coordination of Benefits to see how this works. The benefits Horizon BCBSNJ will pay may also be affected by Medicare. Read the Medicare as Secondary Payor section for an explanation of how this works. SEH 1/14 Page 58 If This Plan Replaces Another Plan The Policyholder who purchased this Policy may have purchased it to replace a plan the Policyholder had with some other carrier. The Covered Person may have incurred charges for covered expenses under the Policyholder's old plan before it ended. If so, these charges will be used to meet this Policy's Cash Deductible if: a) the charges were incurred during the Calendar Year in which this Policy starts or during the 90 days preceding the effective date, whichever is the greater period; b) this Policy would have paid benefits for the charges if this Policy had been in effect: c) the Covered Person was covered by the old plan when it ended and enrolled in this Policy on its Effective Date; and d) this Policy takes effect immediately upon termination of the prior plan. Please note: Although Deductible credit is given, there is no credit for Coinsurance. The Covered Person may have satisfied part of the eligibility Waiting Period under the Policyholder's old plan before it ended. If so, the time satisfied will be used to satisfy this Policy's eligibility waiting period if: a) the Employee was employed by the Policyholder on the date the Policyholder's old plan ended: and b) This Policy takes effect immediately upon termination of the prior plan. Extended Health Benefits If this Policy ends, and a Covered Person is Totally Disabled on such date, and under a Practitioner's care, Horizon BCBSNJ will extend health benefits for that person under this Policy as explained below. This is done at no cost to the Covered Person. Horizon BCBSNJ will only extend benefits for Covered Charges due to the disabling condition. The charges must be incurred before the extension ends. And what Horizon BCBSNJ will pay is based on all the terms of this Policy. Horizon BCBSNJ does not pay for charges due to other conditions. And Horizon BCBSNJ does not pay for charges incurred by other covered family members. The extension ends on the earliest of: a) the date the Total Disability ends; b) one year from the date the person's insurance under this Policy ends; or c) the date the person has reached the payment limit for his or her disabling condition. The Employee must submit evidence to Horizon BCBSNJ that he or she or his or her Dependent is Totally Disabled, if Horizon BCBSNJ requests it. COVERED CHARGES This section lists the types of charges Horizon BCBSNJ will consider as Covered Charges. But what Horizon BCBSNJ will pay is subject to all the terms of this Policy. Read the entire Policy to find out what Horizon BCBSNJ limits or excludes. Hospital Charges Horizon BCBSNJ covers charges for Hospital room and board and Routine Nursing Care when it is provided to a Covered Person by a Hospital on an Inpatient basis. But Horizon BCBSNJ limits what Horizon BCBSNJ pays each day to the room and board limit shown in the Schedule. And Horizon SEH 1/14 Page 59 BCBSNJ covers other Medically Necessary and Appropriate Hospital services and supplies provided to a Covered Person during the Inpatient confinement. Except as stated below, Horizon BCBSNJ covers charges for Inpatient care for: a) a minimum of 72 hours following a modified radical mastectomy; and b) a minimum of 48 hours following a simple mastectomy. Exception: The minimum 72 or 48 hours, as appropriate, of Inpatient care will not be covered if the Covered Person, in consultation with the Practitioner, determines that a shorter length of stay is medically necessary and appropriate. As an exception to the Medically Necessary and Appropriate requirement of this Policy, Horizon BCBSNJ also provides coverage for the mother and newly born child for: a) a minimum of 48 hours of Inpatient care in a Hospital following a vaginal delivery; and b) a minimum of 96 hours of Inpatient Hospital care following a cesarean section. Horizon BCBSNJ provides childbirth and newborn care coverage subject to the following: a) the attending Practitioner must determine that Inpatient care is medically necessary; or b) the mother must request the in-patient care. As an alternative to the minimum level of Inpatient care described above, the mother may elect to participate in a home care program provided by Horizon BCBSNJ. If a Covered Person incurs charges as an Inpatient in a Special Care Unit, Horizon BCBSNJ covers the charges up to the daily room and board limit for a Special Care Unit shown in the Schedule. Horizon BCBSNJ will also cover Outpatient Hospital services, including services provided by a Hospital Outpatient clinic. And Horizon BCBSNJ covers emergency room treatment, subject to this Policy's Emergency Room Copayment Requirement section. Any charges in excess of the Hospital semi -private daily room and board limit are a Non-Covered Charge. This Policy's utilization review features have penalties for non- compliance that may reduce what Horizon BCBSNJ pays for Hospital charges. Emergency Room Copayment Requirement Each time a Covered Person uses the services of a Hospital emergency room, he or she must pay the Copayment shown in the Schedule, in addition to the Cash Deductible, any other Copayments, and Coinsurance, if he or she is not admitted within 24 hours. Emergency and Urgent Care Services Coverage for Emergency and Urgent Care includes coverage of trauma services at any designated level I or II trauma center as Medically Necessary and Appropriate, which shall be continued at least until, in the judgement of the attending physician, the Covered Person is medically stable, no longer requires critical care, and can be safely transferred to another Facility. Horizon BCBSNJ also provides coverage for a medical screening examination provided upon a Covered Person's arrival in a Hospital, as required to be performed by the Hospital in accordance with Federal law, but only as necessary to determine whether an emergency medical condition exists. Please note that the \"911\" emergency response system may be used whenever a Covered Person has a potentially life-threatening condition. Information on the use of the \"911\" system is included on the identification card. SEH 1/14 Page 60 Pre-Admission Testing Charges Horizon BCBSNJ covers pre-admission x-ray and laboratory tests needed for a planned Hospital admission or Surgery. Horizon BCBSNJ only covers these tests if, the tests are done on an Outpatient basis within seven days of the planned admission or Surgery. However, Horizon BCBSNJ will not cover tests that are repeated after admission or before Surgery, unless the admission or Surgery is deferred solely due to a change in the Covered Person's health. Extended Care or Rehabilitation Charges Subject to Horizon BCBSNJ's Pre-Approval Horizon BCBSNJ covers charges up to the daily room and board limit for room and board and Routine Nursing Care shown in the Schedule, provided to a Covered Person on an Inpatient basis in an Extended Care Center or Rehabilitation Center. Charges above the daily room and board limit are a Non-Covered Charge. And Horizon BCBSNJ covers all other Medically Necessary and Appropriate services and supplies provided to a Covered Person during the confinement. But the confinement must: a) start within 14 days of a Hospital stay; and b) be due to the same or a related condition that necessitated the Hospital stay. Horizon BCBSNJ will reduce benefits by 50% with respect to charges for treatment, services and supplies for Extended Care or Rehabilitation which are not Pre-Approved by Horizon BCBSNJ provided that benefits would otherwise be payable under this Policy. Home Health Care Charges Subject to Horizon BCBSNJ's Pre-Approval, when home health care can take the place of Inpatient care, Horizon BCBSNJ covers such care furnished to a Covered Person under a written home health care plan.

Payment is subject to all of the terms of this Policy and to the following conditions: a. The Covered Person's Practitioner must certify that home health care is needed in place of Inpatient care in a recognized Facility. Home health care is covered only in situations where continuing hospitalization or confinement in a Skilled Nursing Facility or Rehabilitation Center would otherwise have been required if Home Health Care were not provided. b. The services and supplies must be: 1. ordered by the Covered Person's Practitioner; SEH 1/14 Page 61 2. included in the home health care plan: and 3. furnished by, or coordinated by, a Home Health Agency according to the written home health care plan. The services and supplies must be furnished by recognized health care professionals on a part-time or intermittent basis, except when full -time or 24 hour service is needed on a short-term (no more than three-day) basis. c. The home health care plan must be set up in writing by the Covered Person's Practitioner within 14 days after home health care starts. And it must be reviewed by the Covered Person's Practitioner at least once every 60 days. d.

Notice of Hospital Admission Required Horizon BCBSNJ requires notice of all Hospital admissions. The times and manner in which the notice must be given is described below. When a Covered Person does not comply with the requirements of this section Horizon BCBSNJ reduces what it pays for covered Hospital charges as a penalty. Pre-Hospital Review All non-Emergency Hospital admissions must be reviewed by Horizon BCBSNJ before they occur. The Covered Person or the Covered Person's Practitioner must notify Horizon BCBSNJ and request a pre- hospital review. Horizon BCBSNJ must receive the notice and request as soon as possible before the admission is scheduled to occur. For a maternity admission, a Covered Person or his or her Practitioner must notify Horizon BCBSNJ and request a pre-hospital review at least 60 days before the expected date of delivery, or as soon as reasonably possible. When Horizon BCBSNJ receives the notice and request, We evaluate: a) the Medical Necessity and Appropriateness of the Hospital admission b) the anticipated length of stay and c) the appropriateness of health care alternatives, like home health care or other out-patient care. Horizon BCBSNJ notifies the Covered Person's Practitioner by phone, of the outcome of our review. And we confirm the outcome of our review in writing. If Horizon BCBSNJ authorizes a Hospital admission, the authorization is valid for: a) the specified Hospital; b) the named attending Practitioner; and c) the authorized length of stay. The authorization becomes invalid and the Covered Person's admission must be reviewed by Horizon BCBSNJ again if: a) he or she enters a Facility other than the specified Facility b) he or she changes attending Practitioners; or c) more than 60 days elapse between the time he or she obtains authorization and the time he or she enters the Hospital, except in the case of a maternity admission.

Continued Stay Review The Covered Person or his or her Practitioner, must request a continued stay review for any Emergency admission. This must be done at the time Horizon BCBSNJ is notified of such admission. The Covered Person, or his or her Practitioner, must also initiate a continued stay review whenever it is Medically Necessary and Appropriate to change the authorized length of a Hospital stay. This must be done before the end of the previously authorized length of stay. Horizon BCBSNJ also has the right to initiate a continued stay review of any Hospital admission. And Horizon BCBSNJ may contact the Covered Person's Practitioner or Hospital by phone or in writing. In the case of an Emergency admission, the continued stay review evaluates: a) the Medical Necessity and Appropriateness of the Hospital admission; b) the anticipated length of stay; and c) the appropriateness of health care alternatives. In all other cases, the continued stay review evaluates: a) the Medical Necessity and Appropriateness of extending the authorized length of stay; and the b) appropriateness of health care alternatives.

Such written notice must be given to the Qualified Continuee within 44 days of: a) the date a Qualified Continuee's group health benefits would otherwise end due to the Employee's death or the Employee's termination of employment or reduction of work hours; or SEH 1/14 Page 92 b) the date a Qualified Continuee notifies the Employer, in writing, of the Employee's legal divorce or legal separation from his or her spouse, or the loss of dependent eligibility of an insured Dependent child. The Employer's Liability The Employer will be liable for the Qualified Continuee's continued group health benefits to the same extent as, and in place of, Horizon BCBSNJ, if: a) the Employer fails to remit a Qualified Continuee's timely premium payment to Horizon BCBSNJ on time, thereby causing the Qualified Continuee's continued group health benefits to end; or b) the Employer fails to notify the Qualified Continuee of his or her continuation rights, as described above. Election of Continuation To continue his or her group health benefits, the Qualified Continuee must give the Employer written notice that he or she elects to continue. An election by a minor Dependent Child can be made by the Dependent Child's parent or legal guardian. This must be done within 60 days of the date a Qualified Continuee receives notice of his or her continuation rights from the Employer as described above. And the Qualified Continuee must pay the first month's premium in a timely manner. The subsequent premiums must be paid to the Employer, by the Qualified Continuee, in advance, at the times and in the manner specified by the Employer. No further notice of when premiums are due will be given. The monthly premium will be the total rate which would have been charged for the group health benefits had the Qualified Continuee stayed insured under this Policy on a regular basis. It includes any amount that would have been paid by the Employer. Except as explained in the Extra Continuation for Disabled Qualified Continuees section, an additional charge of two percent of the total premium charge may also be required by the Employer. If the Qualified Continuee fails to give the Employer notice of his or her intent to continue, or fails to pay any required premiums in a timely manner, he or she waives his or her continuation rights. Grace in Payment of Premiums A Qualified Continuee's premium payment is timely if, with respect to the first payment after the Qualified Continuee elects to continue, such payment is made no later than 45 days after such election. In all other cases, such premium payment is timely if it is made within 31 days of the specified date. If timely payment is made to the plan in an amount that is not significantly less than the amount the Employer requires to be paid for the period of coverage, then the amount paid is deemed to satisfy the Employer's requirement for the amount that must be paid, unless the plan notifies the Qualified Continuee of the amount of the deficiency and grants an additional 30 days for payment of the deficiency to be made. An amount is not significantly less than the amount the Employer requires to be paid for a period of coverage if and only if the shortfall is no greater than the lesser of the following two amounts: a) Fifty dollars (or such other amount as the Commissioner may provide in a revenue ruling, notice, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Code Bulletin); or b) Ten percent of the amount the plan requires to be paid. Payment is considered as made on the date on which it is sent to the Employer. When Continuation Ends A Qualified Continuee's continued group health benefits end on the first of the following: SEH 1/14 Page 93 a) with respect to continuation upon the Employee's termination of employment or reduction of work hours, the end of the 18 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end; b) with respect to a Qualified Continuee who has elected an additional 11 months of continuation due to his or her own disability or the disability of a family member, the earlier of: the end of the 29 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end; or the first day of the month which coincides with or next follows the date which is 30 days after the date on which a final determination is made that a disabled Qualified Continuee is no longer disabled under Title II or Title XVI of the United States Social Security Act; c) with respect to continuation upon the Employee's death, the Employee's legal divorce or legal separation or the end of an insured Dependent's eligibility, the end of the 36 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end; d) with respect to a Dependent whose continuation is extended due to the Employee's entitlement to Medicare, the end of the 36 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end; e) the date this Policy ends; f) the end of the period for which the last premium payment is made; g) the date he or she becomes covered under any other group health plan which contains no limitation or exclusion with respect to any Pre-Existing Condition of the Qualified Continuee or contains a pre- existing conditions limitation or exclusion that is eliminated through the Qualified Continuee's total period of creditable coverage.; h) the date he or she becomes entitled to Medicare; i) termination of a Qualified Continuee for cause (e.g. submission of a fraudulent claim) on the same basis that the Employer terminates coverage of an active employee for cause. NEW JERSEY GROUP CONTINUATION RIGHTS (NJGCR) Important Notice Except as stated below, under this section, \"Qualified Continuee\" means any person who, on the day before any event which would qualify him or her for continuation under this section, is covered for group health benefits under this Policy as: a) a full-time covered Employee; b) the spouse of a full-time covered Employee; or c) the Dependent child of a full-time covered Employee. Exception : A Newly Acquired Dependent, where birth, adoption, or marriage occurs after the Qualifying Event is also a \"Qualified Continuee\" for purposes of being included under the Employee's continuation coverage. If An Employee's Group Health Benefits Ends If an Employee's group health benefits end due to his or her termination of employment or reduction of work hours to fewer than 25 hours per week, he or she may elect to continue such benefits for up to 18 months, unless he or she was terminated for cause. The Employee's spouse and Dependent children may elect to continue benefits even if the Employee does not elect continuation for himself or herself. A Qualified Continuee may elect to continue coverage under NJGCR even if the Qualified Continuee: a) is covered under another group plan on or before the date of the NJGCR election; or b) is entitled to Medicare on or before the date of the NJGCR election. SEH 1/14 Page 94 The continuation: a) may cover the Employee and/or any other Qualified Continuee; and b) is subject to the When Continuation Ends section. Extra Continuation for Disabled Qualified Continuees If a former Employee who is a Qualified Continuee is determined to be disabled under Title II or Title XVI of the United States Social Security Act on the date his or her group health benefits would otherwise end due to the termination of employment or reduction of work hours to fewer than 25 hours per week or during the first 60 days of continuation coverage, he or she may elect to extend his or her 18- month continuation period for himself or herself and any Dependents who are Qualified Continuees for up to an extra 11 months. To elect the extra 11 months of continuation, the Qualified Continuee must give the Horizon BCBSNJ written proof of Social Security's determination of his or her disability before the earlier of: a) the end of the 18 month continuation period; and b) 60 days after the date the Qualified Continuee is determined to be disabled. If, during this extra 11 month continuation period, the Qualified Continuee is determined to be no longer disabled under the Social Security Act, he or she must notify the Horizon BCBSNJ within 31 days of such determination, and continuation will end, as explained in the When Continuation Ends section. An additional 50% of the total premium charge also may be required from the Qualified Continuee by the Employer during this extra 11 month continuation period. If An Employee Dies While Insured If an Employee dies while insured, any Qualified Continuee whose group health benefits would otherwise end may elect to continue such benefits. The continuation can last for up to 36 months, subject to the When Continuation Ends section. If An Employee's Marriage or Civil Union Ends If an Employee's marriage ends due to legal divorce or legal separation or dissolution of the civil union, any Qualified Continuee whose group health benefits would otherwise end may elect to continue such benefits. The continuation can last for up to 36 months, subject to the When Continuation Ends section. If A Dependent Loses Eligibility If a Dependent child's group health benefits end due to his or her loss of dependent eligibility as defined in this Policy, other than the Employee's coverage ending, he or she may elect to continue such benefits for up to 36 months, subject to When Continuation Ends. The Employer's Responsibilities Upon loss of coverage due to termination of employment or reduction in work hours, the Employer must notify the former employee in writing, of: a) his or her right to continue this Policy's group health benefits; b) the monthly premium he or she must pay to continue such benefits; and c) the times and manner in which such monthly payments must be made. Upon being advised of the death of the Employee, divorce, dissolution of the civil union or Dependent child's loss of eligibility, the Employer should notify the Qualified Continuee in writing, of: a) his or her right to continue this Policy's group health benefits; b) the monthly premium he or she must pay to continue such benefits; and SEH 1/14 Page 95 c) the times and manner in which such monthly payments must be made. Election of Continuation To continue his or her group health benefits, the Qualified Continuee must give the Employer written notice that he or she elects to continue. An election by a minor Dependent Child can be made by the Dependent Child's parent or legal guardian. This must be done within 30 days of the date coverage ends. The first month's premium must be paid within 30 days of the date the Qualified Continuee elects continued coverage. The subsequent premiums must be paid to the Employer, by the Qualified Continuee, in advance, at the times and in the manner specified by the Employer. The monthly premium will be the total rate which would have been charged for the group health benefits had the Qualified Continuee stayed insured under this Policy on a regular basis. It includes any amount that would have been paid by the Employer. Except as explained in the Extra Continuation for Disabled Qualified Continuees section, an additional charge of two percent of the total premium charge may also be required by the Employer. If the Qualified Continuee does not give the Employer notice of his or her intent to continue coverage, or fails to pay any required premiums in a timely manner, he or she waives his or her continuation rights. Grace in Payment of Premiums A Qualified Continuee's premium payment is timely if, with respect to the first payment after the Qualified Continuee elects to continue, such payment is made no later than 30 days after such election. In all other cases, such premium payment is timely if it is made within 31 days of the date it is due. The Continued Coverage The continued coverage shall be identical to the coverage provided to similarly situated active Employees and their Dependents under the Employer's plan. If coverage is modified for any group of similarly situated active Employees and their Dependents, the coverage for Qualified Continuees shall also be modified in the same manner. Evidence of insurability is not required for the continued coverage. When Continuation Ends A Qualified Continuee's continued group health benefits end on the first of the following: a) with respect to continuation upon the Employee's termination of employment or reduction of work hours, the end of the 18 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end; b) with respect to a Qualified Continuee who has elected an additional 11 months of continuation due to his or her own disability, the end of the 29 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end. However, if the Qualified Continuee is no longer disabled, coverage ends on the later of: the end of the 18-month period; or the first day of the month that begins more than 31 days after the date on which a final determination is made that a disabled Qualified Continuee is no longer disabled under Title II or Title XVI of the United States Social Security Act; c) with respect to continuation upon the Employee's death, the Employee's legal divorce or legal separation, dissolution of the civil union or the end of an insured Dependent's eligibility, the end of the 36 month period which starts on the date the group health benefits would otherwise end; d) the date the Employer ceases to provide any health benefits plan to any active Employee or Qualified Continuee; e) the end of the period for which the last premium payment is made; SEH 1/14 Page 96 f) the date he or she first becomes covered under any other group health benefits plan, as an employee or otherwise, which contains no limitation or exclusion with respect to any Pre-Existing Condition of the Qualified Continuee; or g) the date he or she first becomes entitled to Medicare. NEW JERSEY CONTINUATION RIGHTS FOR OVER -AGE DEPENDENTS (Applies to all size groups): As used in this provision, \"Over -Age Dependent\" means an Employee's child by blood or law who: a) has reached the limiting age under the group plan, but is less than 31 years of age; b) is not married or in a civil union partnership; c) has no Dependents of his or her own; d) is either a resident of New Jersey or is enrolled as a full-time student at an Accredited School; and e) is not covered under any other group or individual health benefits plan, group health plan, church plan or health benefits plan, and is not entitled to Medicare on the date the Over -Age Dependent continuation coverage begins. If A Dependent Is Over the Limiting Age for Dependent Coverage If a Dependent Child is over the age 26 limiting age for dependent coverage and: a) the Dependent child's group health benefits are ending or have ended due to his or her attainment of age 26; or b) the Dependent child has proof of prior creditable coverage or receipt of benefits, he or she may elect to be covered under the Employer's plan until his or her 31st birthday, subject to the Conditions for Election, Election of Continuation and When Continuation Ends sections below. Conditions for Election An Over -Age Dependent is only entitled to make an election for continued coverage if all of the following conditions are met. a) The Over -Age Dependent must provide evidence of prior creditable coverage or receipt of benefits under a group or individual health benefits plan, group health plan, church plan or health benefits plan or Medicare. Such prior coverage must have been in effect at some time prior to making an election for this Over -Age Dependent coverage. b) A parent of an Over -Age Dependent must be enrolled as having elected Dependent coverage at the time the Over -Age Dependent elects continued coverage. Except, if the Employee has no other Dependents, or has a Spouse who is covered elsewhere, the Over -Age Dependent may nevertheless select continued coverage. Election of Continuation To maintain continuous group health benefits, the Over -Age Dependent must make written election to Horizon BCBSNJ within 30 days of the date the Over -Age Dependent attains age 26. The effective date of the continued coverage will be the date the Dependent would otherwise lose coverage due to attainment of age 26 provided written notice of the election of coverage is given and the first premium is paid. For a Dependent who was not covered on the date he or she reached the limiting age, the written election may be made within 30 days of the date the Over -Age Dependent attains age 26. The effective date of coverage will be the date the Dependent attains age 26 provided written notice of the election of coverage is given and the first premium is paid within such 30-day period. For a person who did not qualify as an Over -Age Dependent because he or she failed to meet all the requirements of an Over -Age Dependent, but who subsequently meets all of the requirements for an SEH 1/14 Page 97 Over -Age Dependent, written election may be made within 30 days of the date the person meets all of the requirements for an Over -Age Dependent. If the election is not made within the 30-day periods described above an eligible Over -Age Dependent may subsequently enroll during an Employee Open Enrollment Period. Payment of Premium The first month's premium must be paid within the 30-day election period provided above. If the election is made during the Employee Open Enrollment Period the first premium must be paid before coverage takes effect on January 1 following the Employee Open Enrollment Period. The Over -Age Dependent must pay subsequent premiums monthly, in advance, at the times and in the manner specified by Horizon BCBSNJ. Grace in Payment of Premiums An Over -Age Dependent's premium payment is timely if, with respect to all payments other than the first payment such premium payment is made within 30 days of the date it is due. The Continued Coverage The continued coverage shall be identical to the coverage provided to the Over -Age Dependent's parent who is covered as an Employee under this Policy and will be evidenced by a separate Certificate and ID card being issued to the Over -Age Dependent. If coverage is modified for Dependents who are under the limiting age, the coverage for Over -Age Dependents shall also be modified in the same manner. When Continuation Ends An Over -Age Dependent's continued group health benefits end on the first of the following: a) the date the Over -Age Dependent: 1. attains age 31 2. marries or enters into a civil union partnership; 3. acquires a Dependent; 4. is no longer either a resident of New Jersey or enrolled as a full-time student at an Accredited School; or 5. becomes covered under any other group or individual health benefits plan, group health plan, church plan or health benefits plan, or becomes entitled to Medicare. b) the end of the period for which premium has been paid for the Over -Age Dependent, subject to the Grace Period for such payment; c) the date this Policy ceases to provide coverage to the Over -Age Dependent's parent who is the Employee under this Policy. d) The date this Policy under which the Over -Age Dependent elected to continue coverage is amended to delete coverage for Dependents. e) The date the Over -Age Dependent's parent who is covered as an Employee under this Policy waives Dependent coverage. Except, if the Employee has no other Dependents, the Over -Age Dependent's coverage will not end as a result of the Employee waiving Dependent coverage. A TOTALLY DISABLED EMPLOYEE'S RIGHT TO CONTINUE GROUP HEALTH BENEFITS If An Employee is Totally Disabled An Employee who is Totally Disabled and whose group health benefits end because his or her active employment or membership in an eligible class ends due to that disability, can elect to continue his or her group health benefits. But he or she must have been insured by this Policy for at least three SEH 1/14 Page 98 months immediately prior to the date his or her group health benefits ends. The continuation can cover the Employee, and at his or her option, his or her then insured Dependents. How And When To Continue Coverage To continue group health benefits, the Employee must give the Employer written notice that he or she elects to continue such benefits. And he or she must pay the first month's premium. This must be done within 31 days of the date his or her coverage under this Policy would otherwise end. Subsequent premiums must be paid to the Employer monthly, in advance, at the times and in the manner specified by the Employer. The monthly premium the Employee must pay will be the total rate charged for an active Full-Time Employee, insured under this Policy on a regular basis, on the date each payment is due. It includes any amount which would have been paid by the Employer. Horizon BCBSNJ will consider the Employee's failure to give notice or to pay any required premium as a waiver of the Employee's continuation rights. If the Employer fails, after the timely receipt of the Employee's payment, to pay Horizon BCBSNJ on behalf of such Employee, thereby causing the Employee's coverage to end; then such Employer will be liable for the Employee's benefits, to the same extent as, and in place of, Horizon BCBSNJ. When This Continuation Ends These continued group health benefits end on the first of the following: a) the end of the period for which the last payment is made, if the Employee stops paying. b) the date the Covered Person becomes employed and eligible or covered for similar benefits by another group plan, whether it be an insured or uninsured plan; c) the date this Policy ends or is amended to end for the class of Employees to which the Employee belonged; or d) with respect to a Dependent, the date he or she stops being an eligible Dependent as defined in this Policy. AN EMPLOYEE'S RIGHT TO CONTINUE GROUP HEALTH BENEFITS DURING A FAMILY LEAVE OF ABSENCE Important Notice This section may not apply to an Employer's Policy. The Employee must contact his or her Employer to find out if: a) the Employer must allow for a leave of absence under Federal law in which case; b) the section applies to the Employee. If An Employee's Group Health Coverage Ends Group health coverage may end for an Employee because he or she ceases Full-Time work due to an approved leave of absence. Such leave of absence must have been granted to allow the Employee to care for a sick family member or after the birth or adoption of a child. If so, his or her group health benefits insurance will be continued. Dependents' insurance may also be continued. The Employee will be required to pay the same share of premium as before the leave of absence. When Continuation Ends Insurance may continue until the earliest of: a) the date the Employee returns to Full-Time work; b) the end of a total leave period of 12 weeks in any 12 month period; SEH 1/14 Page 99 c) the date on which the Employee's coverage would have ended had the Employee not been on leave; or d) the end of the period for which the premium has been paid. A DEPENDENT'S RIGHT TO CONTINUE GROUP HEALTH BENEFITS If an Employee dies, any of his or her Dependents who were insured under this Policy may elect to continue coverage. Subject to the payment of the required premium, coverage may be continued until the earlier of: a) 180 days following the date of the Employee's death; or b) the date the Dependent is no longer eligible under the terms of this Policy. SEH 1/14 Page 100 CONVERSION RIGHTS FOR DIVORCED SPOUSES IF AN EMPLOYEE'S MARRIAGE OR CIVIL UNION ENDS If an Employee's marriage ends by legal divorce or annulment or the employee's civil union is dissolved, the group health benefits for his or her former spouse ends. The former spouse may convert to an individual major medical policy during the conversion period. The former spouse may insure under his or her individual policy any of his or her Dependent children who were insured under this Policy on the date the group health benefits ends. See exceptions below. Exceptions No former spouse may use this conversion right: a) if he or she is eligible for Medicare; or b) if it would cause him or her to be overinsured. This may happen if the spouse is covered or eligible for coverage providing similar benefits provided by any other plan, insured or not insured. Horizon BCBSNJ will determine if overinsurance exists using its standards for overinsurance. HOW AND WHEN TO CONVERT The conversion period means the 31 days after the date group health benefits ends. The former spouse must apply for the individual policy in writing and pay the first premium for such policy during the conversion period. Evidence of insurability will not be required. THE CONVERTED POLICY The individual policy will provide the medical benefits that Horizon BCBSNJ is required to offer in the state where the Employer is located. The individual policy will take effect on the day after group health benefits under this Policy ends. After group health benefits under this Policy ends, the former spouse and any children covered under the individual policy may still be paid benefits under this Policy. If so, benefits to be paid under the individual policy will be reduced by the amount paid under this Policy. SEH 1/14 Page 101 EFFECT OF INTERACTION WITH A HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION PLAN HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (\"HMO\") means a prepaid alternative health care delivery system. A Policyholder may offer its Employees HMO membership in lieu of the group health benefits insurance provided by this Policy. If the Employer does the following provisions apply. IF AN INSURED EMPLOYEE ELECTS HMO MEMBERSHIP Date Group Health Benefits Insurance Ends Insurance for an Employee and his or her Dependents will end on the date the Employee becomes an HMO member. Benefits After Group Health Benefits Insurance Ends When an Employee becomes an HMO member, the Extended Health Benefits section of this Policy will not apply to him or her and his or her Dependents. Exception: IF, on the date membership takes effect, the HMO does not provide benefits due to: a) an HMO waiting period b) an HMO Pre-Existing Conditions limit, or c) a confinement in a Hospital not affiliated with the HMO AND the HMO provides benefits for Total Disability when membership ends THEN group health benefits will be paid until the first of the following occurs: a) 30 days expire from the date membership takes effect b) the HMO's waiting period ends c) the HMO's Pre-Existing Conditions limit expires, or d) hospitalization ends. IF AN HMO MEMBER ELECTS GROUP HEALTH BENEFITS INSURANCE PROVIDED BY THIS POLICY Date Transfer To Such Insur ance Takes Effect Each Empl oyee who is an HMO member may transfer to such insurance by written request. If he or she elects to do so, any Dependents who are HMO members must also be included in such request. The date such persons are to be insured depends on when and why the transfer request is made. Request made during an open enrollment period Horizon BCBSNJ and the Policyholder will agree when this period will be. If an Employee requests insurance during this period, he or she and his or her Dependents will be insured on the date such period ends. Request Made Because: a) an HMO ends its operations b) the Employee no longer lives, works or resides in the HMO service area SEH 1/14 Page 102 If an Employee requests insurance because membership ends for these reasons, the date he or she and his or her Dependents are to be insured depends on the date the request is made. If it is made: a) on or before the date membership ends, they will be insured on the date such membership ends b) within 31 days after the date membership ends, they will be insured on the date the request is made c) more than 31 days after the date membership ends, the Employee and his or her Dependents will be Late Enrollees. Request made because an HMO becomes insolvent If an Employee requests insurance because membership ends for this reason, the date he- or she and his or her Dependents are to be insured depends on the date the request is made. If it is made: a) within 31 days after the date membership ends, they will be insured on the date the request is made b) more than 31 days after the date membership ends, the Employee and his or her Dependents will be Late Enrollees. Request made at any other time An Employee may request insurance at any time other than that described above. In this case, he or she and his or her Dependents will be Late Enrollees. Other Provisions Affected By A Transfer If a person makes a transfer, the following provisions, if required by this Policy for such insurance, will not apply on the transfer date: a) an Actively at Work requirement b) a waiting period to the extent it has already been satisfied, or c) Pre-Existing Conditions Limitation provisions to the extent it has already been satisfied. Charges not covered Charges incurred before a person becomes insured will be considered Non-Covered Charges. Right to change premium rates Horizon BCBSNJ has the right to change premium rates when, in its opinion, its liability under this Policy is changed by interaction with an HMO plan. SEH 1/14 Page 103 COORDINATION OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES Purpose Of This Provision A Covered Person may be covered for health benefits or services by more than one Plan. For instance, he or she may be covered by this Policy as an Employee and by another plan as a Dependent of his or her spouse. If he or she is covered by more than one Plan, this provision allows Horizon BCBSNJ to coordinate what Horizon BCBSNJ pays or provides with what another Plan pays or provides. This provision sets forth the rules for determining which is the Primary Plan and which is the Secondary Plan. Coordination of benefits is intended to avoid duplication of benefits while at the same time preserving certain rights to coverage under all Plans under which the Covered Person is covered. DEFINITIONS The words shown below have special meanings when used in this provision. Please read these definitions carefully. Throughout this provision, these defined terms appear with their initial letter capitalized. Allowable Expense: The charge for any health care service, supply or other item of expense for which the Covered Person is liable when the health care service, supply or other item of expense is covered at least in part under any of the Plans involved, except where a statute requires another definition, or as otherwise stated below. When this Policy is coordinating benefits with a Plan that provides benefits only for dental care, vision care, prescription drugs or hearing aids, Allowable Expense is limited to like items of expense. Horizon BCBSNJ will not consider the difference between the cost of a private hospital room and that of a semi -private hospital room as an Allowable Expense unless the stay in a private room is Medically Necessary and Appropriate. When this Policy is coordinating benefits with a Plan that restricts coordination of benefits to a specific coverage, Horizon BCBSNJ will only consider corresponding services, supplies or items of expense to which coordination of benefits applies as an Allowable Expense. Allowed Charge : An amount that is not more than the usual or customary charge for the service or supply as determined by Horizon BCBSNJ, based on a standard which is most often charged for a given service by a Provider within the same geographic area . Claim Determination Period: A Calendar Year, or portion of a Calendar Year, during which a Covered Person is covered by this Policy and at least one other Plan and incurs one or more Allowable Expense(s) under such plans. Plan: Coverage with which coordination of benefits is allowed. Plan includes: a) Group insurance and group subscriber contracts, including insurance continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law; b) Self-funded arrangements of group or group-type coverage, including insurance continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law; c) Group or group-type coverage through a health maintenance organization (HMO) or other prepayment, group practice and individual practice plans, including insurance continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law; d) Group hospital indemnity benefit amounts that exceed $150 per day; SEH 1/14 Page 104 e) Medicare or other governmental benefits, except when, pursuant to law, the benefits must be treated as in excess of those of any private insurance plan or non-governmental plan. \"Plan\" does not include: a) Individual or family insurance contracts or subscriber contracts; b) Individual or family coverage through a health maintenance organization or under any other prepayment, group practice and individual practice plans; c) Group or group-type coverage where the cost of coverage is paid solely by the Covered Person except that coverage being continued pursuant to a Federal or State continuation law shall be considered a Plan; d) Group hospital indemnity benefit amounts of $150 per day or less; e) School accident -type coverage; f) A State plan under Medicaid. Primary Plan: A Plan whose benefits for a Covered Person's health care coverage must be determined without taking into consideration the existence of any other Plan. There may be more than one Primary Plan. A Plan will be the Primary Plan if either either \"a\" or \"b\" below exist: The Plan has no order of benefit determination rules, or it has rules that differ from those contained in this Coordination of Benefits and Services provision; or All Plans which cover the Covered Person use order of benefit determination rules consistent with those contained in the Coordination of Benefits and Services provision and under those rules, the plan determines its benefits first. Secondary Plan: A Plan which is not a Primary Plan. If a Covered Person is covered by more than one Secondary Plan, the order of benefit determination rules of this Coordination of Benefits and Services provision shall be used to determine the order in which the benefits payable under the multiple Secondary Plans are paid in relation to each other. The benefits of each Secondary Plan may take into consideration the benefits of the Primary Plan or Plans and the benefits of any other Plan which, under this Coordination of Benefits and Services provision, has its benefits determined before those of that Secondary Plan. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY PLAN Horizon BCBSNJ considers each plan separately when coordinating payments. The Primary Plan pays or provides services or supplies first, without taking into consideration the existence of a Secondary Plan. If a Plan has no coordination of benefits provision, or if the order of benefit determination rules differ from those set forth in these provisions, it is the Primary Plan. A Secondary Plan takes into consideration the benefits provided by a Primary Plan when, according to the rules set forth below, the plan is the Secondary Plan. If there is more than one Secondary Plan, the order of benefit determination rules determine the order among the Secondary Plans. During each Claim Determination Period the Secondary Plan(s) will pay up to the remaining unpaid allowable expenses, but no Secondary Plan will pay more than it would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. The method the Secondary Plan uses to determine the amount to pay is set forth below in the \"Procedures to be Followed by the Secondary Plan to Calculate Benefits\" section of this provision. The Secondary Plan shall not reduce Allowable Expenses for medically necessary and appropriate services or supplies on the basis that precertification, preapproval, notification or second surgical opinion procedures were not followed. SEH 1/14 Page 105 RULES FOR THE ORDER OF BENEFIT DETERMINATION The benefits of the Plan that covers the Covered Person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree shall be determined before those of the Plan that covers the Covered Person as a Dependent. The coverage as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree is the Primary Plan. The benefits of the Plan that covers the Covered Person as an employee who is neither laid off nor retired, or as a dependent of such person, shall be determined before those for the Plan that covers the Covered Person as a laid off or retired employee, or as such a person's Dependent. If the other Plan does not contain this rule, and as a result the Plans do not agree on the order of benefit determination, this portion of this provision shall be ignored. The benefits of the Plan that covers the Covered Person as an employee, member, subscriber or retiree, or Dependent of such person, shall be determined before those of the Plan that covers the Covered Person under a right of continuation pursuant to Federal or State law. If the other Plan does not contain this rule, and as a result the Plans do not agree on the order of benefit determination, this portion of this provision shall be ignored. If a child is covered as a Dependent under Plans through both parents, and the parents are neither separated nor divorced, the following rules apply: a) The benefits of the Plan of the parent whose birthday falls earlier in the Calendar Year shall be determined before those of the parent whose birthday falls later in the Calendar Year. b) If both parents have the same birthday, the benefits of the Plan which covered the parent for a longer period of time shall be determined before those of plan which covered the other parent for a shorter period of time. c) Birthday, as used above, refers only to month and day in a calendar year, not the year in which the parent was born. d) If the other plan contains a provision that determines the order of benefits based on the gender of the parent, the birthday rule in this provision shall be ignored. If a child is covered as a Dependent under Plans through both parents, and the parents are separated or divorced, the following rules apply: a) The benefits of the Plan of the parent with custody of the child shall be determined first. b) The benefits of the Plan of the spouse of the parent with custody shall be determined second. c) The benefits of the Plan of the parent without custody shall be determined last. d) If the terms of a court decree state that one of the parents is responsible for the health care expenses for the child, and if the entity providing coverage under that Plan has actual knowledge of the terms of the court decree, then the benefits of that plan shall be determined first. The benefits of the plan of the other parent shall be considered as secondary. Until the entity providing coverage under the plan has knowledge of the terms of the court decree regarding health care expenses, this portion of this provision shall be ignored. If the above order of benefits does not establish which plan is the Primary Plan, the benefits of the Plan that covers the employee, member or subscriber for a longer period of time shall be determined before the benefits of the Plan(s) that covered the person for a shorter period of time. Procedures to be Followed by the Secondary Plan to Calculate Benefits In order to determine which procedure to follow it is necessary to consider: a) the basis on which the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan pay benefits; and SEH 1/14 Page 106 b) whether the provider who provides or arranges the services and supplies is in the network of either the Primary Plan or the Secondary Plan. Benefits may be based on the Allowed Charge (AC), or some similar term. This means that the provider bills a charge and the Covered Person may be held liable for the full amount of the billed charge. In this section, a Plan that bases benefits on an Allowed Charge is called an \"AC Plan.\" Benefits may be based on a contractual fee schedule, sometimes called a negotiated fee schedule, or some similar term. This means that although a provider, called a network provider, bills a charge, the Covered Person may be held liable only for an amount up to the negotiated fee. In this section, a Plan that bases benefits on a negotiated fee schedule is called a \"Fee Schedule Plan.\" Fee Schedule Plans may require that Covered Person use network providers. Examples of such plans are Health Maintenance Organization plans (HMO) and Exclusive Provider organization plans (EPO). If the Covered Person uses the services of a non-network provider, the plan will be treated as an AC Plan even though the plan under which he or she is covered allows for a fee schedule. Examples of such plans are Preferred provider organization plans (PPO) and Point of Service plans (POS). Payment to the provider may be based on a \"capitation\". This means that then HMO or EPO or other plans pays the provider a fixed amount per Covered Person. The Covered Person is liable only for the applicable deductible, coinsurance or copayment. If the Covered Person uses the services of a non- network provider, the HMO or other plans will only pay benefits in the event of emergency care or urgent care. In this section, a Plan that pays providers based upon capitation is called a \"Capitation Plan.\" In the rules below, \"provider\" refers to the provider who provides or arranges the services or supplies and \"HMO\" refers to a health maintenance organization plan and \"EPO\" refers to Exclusive Provider Organization. Primary Plan is AC Plan and Secondary Plan is AC Plan The Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) The difference between the amount of the billed charges and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or b) The amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. When the benefits of the Secondary Plan are reduced as a result of this calculation, each benefit shall be reduced in proportion, and the amount paid shall be charged against any applicable benefit limit of the plan. Primary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan and Secondary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan If the provider is a network provider in both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan, the Allowable Expense shall be the fee schedule of the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) The amount of any deductible, coinsurance or copayment required by the Primary Plan; or b) The amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. The total amount the provider receives from the Primary plan, the Secondary plan and the Covered Person shall not exceed the fee schedule of the Primary Plan. In no event shall the Covered Person be responsible for any payment in excess of the copayment, coinsurance or deductible of the Secondary Plan. Primary Plan is AC Plan and Secondary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan If the provider is a network provider in the Secondary Plan, the Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) The difference between the amount of the billed charges for the Allowable Expenses and the amount paid by the Primary Plan; or b) The amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. SEH 1/14 Page 107 The Covered Person shall only be liable for the copayment, deductible or coinsurance under the Secondary Plan if the Covered Person has no liability for copayment, deductible or coinsurance under the Primary Plan and the total payments by both the primary and Secondary Plans are less than the provider's billed charges. In no event shall the Covered Person be responsible for any payment in excess of the copayment, coinsurance or deductible of the Secondary Plan. Primary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan and Secondary Plan is AC Plan If the provider is a network provider in the Primary Plan, the Allowable Expense considered by the Secondary Plan shall be the fee schedule of the Primary Plan. The Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) The amount of any deductible, coinsurance or copayment required by the Primary Plan; or b) The amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. Primary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan and Secondary Plan is AC Plan or Fee Schedule Plan If the Primary Plan is an HMO or EPO plan that does not allow for the use of non-network providers except in the event of urgent care or emergency care and the service or supply the Covered Person receives from a non-network provider is not considered as urgent care or emergency care, the Secondary Plan shall pay benefits as if it were the Primary Plan. Primary Plan is Capitation Plan and Secondary Plan is Fee Schedule Plan or AC Plan If the Covered Person receives services or supplies from a provider who is in the network of both the Primary Plan and the Secondary Plan, the Secondary Plan shall pay the lesser of: a) The amount of any deductible, coinsurance or copayment required by the Primary Plan; or b) The amount the Secondary Plan would have paid if it had been the Primary Plan. Primary Plan is Capitation Plan or Fee Schedule Plan or AC Plan and Secondary Plan is Capitation Plan If the Covered Person receives services or supplies from a provider who is in the network of the Secondary Plan, the Secondary Plan shall be liable to pay the capitation to the provider and shall not be liable to pay the deductible, coinsurance or copayment imposed by the Primary Plan. The Covered Person shall not be liable to pay any deductible, coinsurance or copayments of either the Primary Plan or the Secondary Plan. Primary Plan is an HMO or EPO and Secondary Plan is an HMO or EPO If the Primary Plan is an HMO or EPO plan that does not allow for the use of non-network providers except in the event of urgent care or emergency care and the service or supply the Covered Person receives from a non-network provider is not considered as urgent care or emergency care, but the provider is in the network of the Secondary Plan, the Secondary Plan shall pay benefits as if it were the Primary Plan. Except that the Primary Plan shall pay out-of-Network services, if any, authorized by the Primary Plan. SEH 1/14 Page 108 BENEFITS FOR AUTOMOBILE RELATED INJURIES This section will be used to determine a person's benefits under this Policy when expenses are incurred as a result of an automobile related Injury.

This Policy provides secondary coverage to PIP unless health coverage has been elected as primary coverage by or for the Covered Person under this Policy. This election is made by the named insured under a PIP policy. Such election affects that person's family members who are not themselves named insureds under another automobile policy. This Policy may be primary for one Covered Person, but not for another if the person has separate automobile policies and has made different selections regarding primacy of health coverage. This Policy is secondary to OSAIC, unless the OSAIC contains provisions which make it secondary or excess to the policyholder's plan. In that case this Policy will be primary. If there is a dispute as to which policy is primary, this Policy will pay benefits as if it were primary. Benefits this Policy will pay if it is primary to PIP or OSAIC. If this Policy is primary to PIP or OSAlC it will pay benefits for eligible expenses in accordance with its terms. The rules of the COORDINATION OF BENEFITS AND SERVICES section of this Policy will apply if: a) the Covered Person is insured under more than one insurance plan; and b) such insurance plans are primary to automobile insurance coverage.

Medicare If this Policy supplements coverage under Medicare it can be primary to automobile insurance only to the extent that Medicare is primary to automobile insurance. SEH 1/14 Page 110 MEDICARE AS SECONDARY PAYOR IMPORTANT NOTICE The following sections regarding Medicare may not apply to the Employer's Policy. The Employee must contact his or her Employer to find out if the Employer is subject to Medicare as Secondary Payor rules. If the Employer is subject to such rules, this Medicare as Secondary Payor section applies to the Employee. If the Employer is NOT subject to such rules, this Medicare as Secondary Payor section does not apply to the Employee, in which case, Medicare will be the primary health plan and this Policy will be the secondary health plan for Covered Persons who are eligible for Medicare. The following provisions explain how this Policy's group health benefits interact with the benefits available under Medicare as Secondary Payor rules. A Covered Person may be eligible for Medicare by reason of age, disability, or End Stage Renal Disease. Different rules apply to each type of Medicare eligibility, as explained below. With respect to the following provisions: a) \"Medicare\" when used above, means Part A and B of the health care program for the aged and disabled provided by Title XVIII of the United States Social Security Act, as amended from time to time. b) A Covered Person is considered to be eligible for Medicare by reason of age from the first day of the month during which he or she reaches age 65.

A \"secondary\" health plan then pays the remaining unpaid allowable expenses. See the Coordination of Benefits section for a definition of \"allowable expense\". d) \"We\" means Carrier MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY BY REASON OF AGE (Generally applies to employer groups with 20 or more employees) Applicability This section applies to an Employee or his or her insured spouse who is eligible for Medicare by reason of age.
