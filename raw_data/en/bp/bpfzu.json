Objective: To describe the CAM workforce across five developed countries to better inform health workforce and health services planning, and perchance, inform debate on future public health and primary care policy. Methods: Data from the Australian, New Zealand, Canadian, UK and US Censuses of population were interrogated for information pertaining to the size and characteristics of the CAM workforce. This was supplemented by other population-level workforce data where available. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth 2012 C D Howe Institute Commentary No. 541 2019 Alternative medicines need risk-based regulation according to a newly released report from the C.D. Howe Institute. In \"Regulating Alternative Medicines: Disorder in the Borderlands\" authors Michael J. Trebilcock and Kanksha Mahadevia Ghimire recommend regulating certain popular forms of alternative medicine, especially when their use could be life-threatening to patients. In many Western countries, the use of complementary and alternative medicines\u2014such as naturopathy, homeopathy, acupuncture, traditional Chinese medicine, chiropractic medicine, osteopathy, and Western herbal medicine\u2014has been growing. In most contemporary societies, biomedicine (also referred to as Western medicine) is strictly regulated, while regulation of alternatives is disconcertingly inconsistent and exists in a patchwork across jurisdictions. Patients may use alternative medicines in conjunction with biomedicine, but may choose to rely solely on alternatives to biomedicine. \"With use of alternative medicine increasing, a better approach to regulating certain popular alternative medicine is needed,\" said Trebilcock. The central challenge for regulation is how to allow for patients' autonomy over their own treatment, while addressing the severe information asymmetries between practitioner and patient: a situation worsened when professionals misrepresent their skills or the benefits of their services. \"Regulation of CAMs should be calibrated to the degree of risk entailed, especially when alternatives are promoted as substitutes for, rather than as complements to, biomedicine in treating potentially life-threatening health conditions,\" said Trebilcock The report recommends: 1. That regulatory responses should be calibrated to the degree of risk entailed for patients. 2. State-sanctioned forms of delegated self-regulation of certification regimes by practitioners themselves. 3. The creation by government of an overarching advisory body - an alternative medicine advisory council 4. Ensuring that persons responsible are held liable for fraudulent, false or misleading advertisements or claims, tortious liability for negligence or criminal liability for gross negligence.
