Tobacco is offered for many reasons and in many different contexts. It is appropriate when asking for assistance from an Indigenous elder, knowledge keeper or person to offer tobacco. When the person accepts the tobacco, they are agreeing to help in some way. Offering tobacco is a respectful way of asking for assistance and not as symbol of gratitude after help is provided. When someone accepts tobacco they are agreeing to listen openly and without judgement and to support you as best they can. It is appropriate to offer tobacco when asking for a song, an opening prayer, a teaching, Indigenous knowledge, or for advice. This should not replace remuneration or honoraria.
