My story of healing began as a child in New York. I was that sensitive kid who would go around and hug strangers and tell them they were loved. As an adult, I came to understand that I was an empath and could feel the pain that those around me were going through. No surprise, this would lead to a very successful career as a funeral director in Towson. A few years ago, I started to realize that my natural ability to bring in light where there was darkness, could do more than just deal with grief. It was my Reiki practitioner, Devyn Samios-Uy, who introduced me to my teacher Michelle Garber. From here, I discovered a deeper understanding of life, along with the purpose and responsibility I was given as a psychic energy healer. I studied under her tutelage for 2 years, learning the Shamanic healing of Jaguar Medicine, and the Ayurvedic approach of Crystal Healing. I continued on to learn the Japanese form of energy healing called Reiki from Tranquili-Chi Centers' very own Reiki Master Cheryl L. Hicks. It is an honor and a privilege to be here at the Tranquili-Chi Center and I cannot wait for our journey of healing to begin. Much peace, love and blessings to you and your family. Namaste! "}
