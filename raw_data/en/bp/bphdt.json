The energetics of the body correspond with the electrical current of the autonomic nervous system. These electrical currents develop a subtle energy both within and outside the human body. During energy healing sessions, we address the ways in which stagnation, tension, fatigue, traumatic injury, stress, and repressed emotions show up as patterns within our body. By adjusting this subtle energy, we release tension held in the autonomic nervous system, which leads to a greater capacity of healing and repair. Your healing work will include these adjustments as you develop a greater understanding of the energetic systems of the body and how this relates to your thoughts, emotions, physical health, and spirit. Energy Healing is an interactive and holistic approach that involves your full engagement and participation in your healing process. "}
