As we weathered the storms and stress, our NEA community became more resilient than ever. If there was one silver lining during this difficult time, for me, it was the connection we were still able to find with one another \u2014 especially for the eczema community, who understands better than most how it feels to be socially isolated and anxious about the well- being of our loved ones. I'm proud to share that through it all, NEA forged ahead with dedication to our commitment to serve the eczema community in new and innovative ways. Thanks to our partners and supporters, we succeeded. One of the first challenges NEA faced early in the pandemic was the decision to cancel our in-person Eczema Expo. We couldn't imagine anything taking the place of our most anticipated annual gathering. But sure enough, our community came out and showed up! Engagement in the first ever Virtual Expo from our presenters, experts of all kinds and community of eczema warriors made this a truly triumphant event. Throughout the pandemic, NEA continued to be the #1 source for trustworthy information on all things Covid-19 and eczema. We provided tools for mental health and emotional well-being our community could count on. Our efforts helped people navigate the unprecedented challenges of 2020, and we were ready to answer medical questions from our community related to eczema and Covid-19. In October 2020, we launched EczemaWise, a revolutionary new app to help eczema families achieve improved health outcomes. EczemaWise helps patients and caregivers track triggers, manage symptoms and partner with healthcare providers to develop a personalized eczema care plan. We also rolled out our brand-new program NEA Ambassadors. NEA Ambassadors provides a virtual platform for eczema warriors to connect with others to exchange experiences, find inspiration and make positive change in the areas of eczema advocacy, research and community outreach. NEA maintains its leadership role as the largest private funder of eczema research in the world, and we continue to increase our investment in patient- centered research. As just one example of the groundbreaking research we fund, NEA teamed up with the Pediatric Dermatology Research Alliance (PeDRA) to offer the first-of-its-kind Childhood Eczema Challenge Grant. This joint initiative was formed to accelerate research to improve the lives of the more than 10 million U.S. children with atopic dermatitis. The NEA Research Fund 2025 was established in 2020 to secure the resources needed for the expansion of the research we fund, as well as the research we conduct. By the end of 2025 we aim to raise $1 million from individual supporters dedicated to innovative, patient-centered eczema research. Lastly, we spent a good part of the year looking to the future and developing our new five-year strategic plan. The collaboration with our community of eczema warriors, researchers, clinicians, donors and pharma partners was truly extraordinary \u2014 we are one and we will continue to make an impact and a difference in the lives of the 31 million Americans with eczema. Yours with gratitude, Julie Block \u2014 President & CEOLETTER FROM OUR CEONEA 2020 Annual Report3RESEARCH ACCOMPLISHMENTS NEA has established a dynamic, multi-faceted research program to increase the scientific and clinical understanding of eczema, as well as its many impacts on individuals and their families.

Becoming a NEA Ambassador gives people with eczema and their loved ones the chance to learn, build skills and volunteer \u2014 all in service to the broader eczema community. NEA Ambassadors are advancing the understanding of atopic dermatitis among the general public, in the field of eczema research and with decision makers. NEA RESEARCH FUND NEA is the largest private funder of eczema research in the country, and we ensure the patient's voice is included in the development of new treatments. To date, we've distributed more than $1.7 million in eczema research funding, and we are poised to dramatically increase that investment in the coming years. We established the NEA Research Fund in 2020 to generate the resources we need to continue this critical work. ECZEMAWISE In fall 2020 NEA unveiled EczemaWise, a first-of-its-kind app designed to save patients and caregivers time and hassle by helping them keep a record of eczema triggers, symptoms and treatments, tracking and saving the information in one place. Based on science and designed with input from the eczema community and physicians, the app reveals insights that can be shared with physicians and used to better manage the disease and tailor treatment plans.
