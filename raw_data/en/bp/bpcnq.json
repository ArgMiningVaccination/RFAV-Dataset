A bioterrorist event may be either announced (overt) or unannounced (covert). An announced (overt) event would include a notification that an agent has been released, leading law enforcement and public health to be involved from the beginning. An unannounced (covert) event might not be noticed until days or weeks after the event, once the initial incubation period is complete. Hospitals would probably be the first to receive patients exhibiting symptoms and initially the illness may be perceived as an unusual disease cluster. Hospital and clinical laboratories are the first line of defense against biothreat agent infections and emerging infectious diseases. These laboratories will likely be the first to see clinical specimens from patients who have been exposed to intentional biothreat agent releases, naturally occurring biothreat agents or emerging infectious diseases. Their quick recognition and communication of these suspect agents is the key to rapid identification and response. This guide was d eveloped to assist laboratories by providing guidance on the responsibilities and practices that are recommended when dealing with biothreat agents. In it you will find the tools and standards necessary to recognize if your laboratory has received a patie nt specimen containing a biothreat agent and how to handle it. This guide also covers basic laboratory biosafety, packaging and shipping, regulations that impact LRN Sentinel Laboratories and much more. USING THIS GUIDE This manual should not take the place of your standard operating procedures. It is intended as a tool to assist the clinician or laboratorian with recognizing biothreat agent characteristics. It also acts as a reference on the standards for testing for the se agents and procedures on how to follow up with your State and Federal partners if those tests indicate a suspect biothreat agent. It is recommended that this guide be stored near the laboratory where it can be readily accessible to the appropriate labo ratory staff. Any laboratorian who will be involved in the analysis of a suspected biothreat agent should be trained in the identification and referral procedures and packaging and shipping requirements. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1/ 2016 11 SENTINEL LABORATORY DEFINITION LRN sentinel laboratories consist of any laboratory capable of analyzing or referring specimens or samples that may contain microbial agents, biological toxins, chemical agen ts or their metabolites, or radiological agents. This includes environmental, food, veterinary, agriculture, military, public health, as well as clinical laboratories who may, through routine activities, encounter samples that contain these types of dange rous agents from specimens. In addition to recognizing threat agents, sentinel laboratories work closely with public health to monitor diseases reportable by state law and to assist in the surveillance of endemic or emerging pathogens and pandemics. Labo ratories that do not meet the sentinel criteria but believe they may have encountered a biothreat agent should contact their local LRN Reference Laboratory or County Health Department for assistance. Think safety first. Sentinel laboratories are only requi red to use the appropriate methods for ruling out biothreat agents. If this is not possible, laboratories should not attempt to identify the organism. Remember trigger points. Contact your LRN Reference Laboratory or Public Health Agency to determine if patient samples should be sent. Have at least two members of your staff trained in how to safely and correctly package and ship Category A and Category B infectious agents. SENTINEL CLINICA L LABORATORY DEFINITIO N The laboratory is certified to perform high complexity testing under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) for the applicable Microbiology specialty or the laboratory is a Department of Defense (DoD) Laboratory certified under the DoD Clinical Laboratory Improvement Program or the laboratory is a veterinary medical diagnostic laboratory that is fully accredited by the American Association of Veterinary Lab oratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD).

SENTINEL LAB DEFINITION http://www.asm.org/images/PSAB/Sentinel -Clinical -Laboratory- Definition_2013.pdf 15 LABORATORY RESPONSE NETWORK (LRN) The Laboratory Response Network (LRN) was launched by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 1999. The LRN is a vast international network comprised of local, state and federal public health laboratories, international laboratories, as well as food testing, veterinary diagnostic, and environmental testing laboratories that provide the laboratory infrastructure and capac ity to respond to biological and chemical terrorism, and other public health emergencies. The LRN is also a partnership between key stakeholders in the preparation and response to biological and chemical terrorism. The CDC, the Federal Bureau of Investigat ion (FBI), and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL) were key partners in establishing the LRN . The CDC is currently overseeing the LRN program. LABORATORY NETWORK F OR BIOLOGICAL TERROR ISM (LRN -B) LRN bioterrorism preparedness and response activities emphasize local laboratory response by helping to increase the number of trained laboratory workers in state and local public health facilities; distributing standardized test methods and reagents to local labs; promoting the acquisition of adv anced technologies; and supporting facility improvements. There are currently more than 150 member laboratories on the biological side of the LRN. Although the majority of current members are public health laboratories, there are also military, internatio nal, veterinary, agriculture, food, and water testing laboratories, representing all 50 states, Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, Mexico and South Korea. The LRN continues to add new member laboratories for biological agent detection. One of the LRN's goals is to expand membership to broaden the scope of biological agent detection, particularly among veterinary diagnostic, food and water testing, private, and commercial laboratories. SENTINEL LABORATORIE S LRN sentinel laboratories play a key role in the early detection of biological agents. Sentinel laboratories provide routine diagnostic services, rule -out, and referral steps in the identification process. While these laboratories may not be equipped or authorized to perform the same tests as LRN reference laboratories, they can test samples. There are an estimated 25,000 private and commercial laboratories in the United States, some of which can provide critical sentinel laboratory capacity. The majority of these laboratories are hospital -based, clini cal institutions, and commercial diagnostic laboratories. The LRN is currently wo rking with the American Society for Microbiology and state public health laboratory directors to ensure that these private and commercial laboratories are part of the LRN. 16 While most of these laboratories do not have the facilities or the technology to perform confirmatory testing, they represent the first contact with patients and are in a position to alert public health officials. They can also conduct tests to rule out othe r diseases and ship samples to appropriate reference laboratories . REFERENCE LABORATORI ES LRN r eference laboratories are responsible for investigating, testing and/or referring suspect specimens. Inclusion as a reference testing facility for biological agent detection is not automatic and prospective members must demonstrate certain capabilities and capacities, and meet established agent -specific performance standards. For both biological and chemical laboratory membership, the state public health laborator y director has a key role in determining whether additional laboratory capacity is critical to the state's overall emergency response goals. If needed, additional laboratories may be invited to participate by a state laboratory director. NATIONAL LABORATOR IES LRN n ational laboratories, including those operated by CDC, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), and the Naval Medical Research Center (NMRC), are responsible for specialized strain characterizations, bioforensics, s elect agent activity, and handling highly infectious biological agents. http://www.emergency.cdc.gov/lrn/biological.asp LABORATORY RESPONSE NETWORK FOR CHEMICAL THREATS (LRN -C) The chemical preparedness side of the LRN (LRN -C) employs a more centralized structure. This means initial testing in a suspected chemical event will occur at CDC. Using sophisticated and unique high -throughput analysis capabilities, such as mass spectrometry, CDC labo ratories perform tests on the first 40 clinical specimens to measure human exposure. Results of these tests are reported to affected states, and if needed, appropriate LRN members may be asked to test additional samples. This approach is necessary because the analytical expertise and technology resources required to respond to a chemical event is substantially high. CDC funding supports 62 U.S. states, territories, and metropolitan areas through the Public Health Emergency Preparedness cooperative agreement. In 2010, fifty -three laboratories within these jurisdictions provided emergency response capabilities for their local areas, the nation, or both. These laboratories make up the chemical component of the Laboratory Response Network (LRN). CDC has assisted LRN -C members with purchasing instruments needed for measuring chemicals in blood and urine specimens. Because of the complexity of the instrumentation, on- site operation training is provided by the instrument vendor as part of the purchase package. Through hands -on training at CDC and computer - 17 based training, CDC trains Level 1 and Level 2 labs on analytical methods. Network members that receive methods and instrumentation must also participate in a rigorous quality assurance program to ensure that network labs provide precise, accurate, high- quality data. CDC also provides a \"train -the-trainer\" course that will give chemical terrorism coordinators the tools they need to train partners in their jur isdictions, such as hospital staff, about sample collection and shipping. A designation of Level 1, 2, or 3 identifies laboratory capabilities and defines member network participation. (Please note that the level designations changed in early 2005 so that laboratories previously designated \"Level 1\" are now \"Level 3,\" and laboratories previously designated \"Level 3\" are now \"Level 1.\") LEVEL 3 LABORATORIES Nine laboratories are designated as Level 3 laboratories. All 53 laboratories have Level 3 capacity. These laboratories work with hospitals and other first responders within their jurisdiction to maintain competency in clinical specimen collection, storage , and shipment. LEVEL 2 LABORATORIES Thirty -four labs are designated as Level 2 laboratories. Chemists in these laboratories are trained to detect exposure to a number of toxic chemical agents. Analysis of cyanide, nerve agents, and toxic metals in human samples are examples of Level 2 activities. LEVEL 1 LABORATORIES Ten laboratories currently participate in Level 1 activities. These laboratories, which serve as surge- capacity laboratories for the CDC, are able to detect the toxic chemical agents that Level 2 laboratories can detect plus exposure to an expanded number of chemicals, including mustard agents, nerve agents, and other toxic industrial chemicals. Using unique high -throughput analysis capabilities, they expand CDC's ability to analyze large number of patient samples when responding to large- scale exposure incidents. http://www.emergency.cdc.gov/lrn/chemical.asp CONTACTING THE LABOR ATORY RESPONSE NETWO RK (LRN) NOTE : If you believe that y ou have been exposed to a biological or chemical agent, or if you believe an intentional biological threat will occur or is occurring, please contact your local health department and/or your local police or other law enforcement agency. Local public health laboratories, private laboratories, and commercial laboratories with questions about the LRN should contact their state public health laboratory director or the Association of Public Health Laboratories. 18 ROLE OF EPIDEMIOLOGI STS Epidemiology is the scie nce that studies the patterns, causes, and effects of health and disease conditions for defined populations. Considered one of the cornerstones of public health, epidemiologists work closely with reference laboratories along with a wide variety of other me mbers of the public health team to perform surveillance, detect outbreaks, implement control & preventive measures, and communicate findings and recommendations. To accomplish this, epidemiologists collect data on reportable disease -causing organisms and s ymptoms meeting case definitions to detect outbreaks by interviewing patients or their families, gather patient demographics, note the signs and symptoms of the disease, develop a timeline of the exposure history and laboratory results. The knowledge that epidemiology brings to the table helps to identify health risk factors, prevention strategies, community needs, works to target prevention and informs health policy decisions on local, national and global levels. This information can be used to prevent fu ture adverse health events from occurring with the appropriate government and community support. Each state has a list of diseases that are reportable. Make sure that you are aware of the laws in your state, as well as who to contact in the event you sus pect one of these diseases. Additionally, active surveillance can help identify trends that might indicate an outbreak. Sharing information between the laboratory and the proper county and state officials is vital in protecting the public's health. 19 OTH ER EMERGENCY PREPAREDNE SS RESPONSE INFORMAT ION: CHEMICAL THREATS Chemical agents can be poisonous vapors, aerosols, liquids or solids that can have toxic effects on people, animals, or plants. These chemicals can be naturally occurring in the environment or synthetically produced. Chemical releases can be unintentional, as in the case of an industrial accident, or intentional, as in the case of a terrorist attack. Early detection and accurate id entification are critical to enable effective treatment and to prevent additional exposures of chemical threats. Some chemical agents are odorless and tasteless. Their effects can be immediate (a few seconds to a few minutes) or delayed (2 to 48 hours). W hile some agents are lethal, they are difficult to deliver in lethal concentrations due to either production issues or the fact that they dissipate rapidly. A chemical attack could come without warning. The presence of many dead insects or birds may indica te a chemical agent release. Signs of a human exposure may include difficulty breathing; eye irritation; loss of coordination; nausea; or a burning sensation in the nose, throat, and lungs. The LRN -C is activated when a suspected terrorist incident or sig nificant chemical exposure event has occurred. CDC may advise medical facilities to collect blood and/or urine specimens from affected patients in accordance with the appropriate specimen collection and shipping protocols: (http://emergency.cdc.gov/labissues/pdf/Flowchart_ChemEvent_Specimen_collection.pdf ). CHEMICAL EMERGENCY R ESPONSE TEAM CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) and National Biomonitoring Program (NBP) provide effective laboratory support for the public health response to chemical threat agents and threats involving selected toxins. The CDC maintains 24 -7 laboratory res ponse capability and can deploy the Chemical Emergency Response Team within two hours of a request to assist with specimen collection, packaging, storage, and shipment. DLS scientists work with state and local officials to collect samples and transport the m to CDC where testing can be done to assess people's exposure to chemical agents. RAPID TOXIC SCREEN The CDC laboratory developed and performs the Rapid Toxic Screen (RTS), a series of tests that analyzes 150 chemical agents in people's blood and urine. R esults of the Rapid Toxic Screen help identify those exposed, to what chemical(s) they were exposed, and how much of a particular chemical their bodies absorbed. This information is critical to medical and public health personnel managing a chemical public health emergency.

Examples of different types of radiation emergencies include nuclear emergencies that include a nuclear weapon or improvised nuclear device (IND), dirty bombs or radiol ogical dispersion devices (RDD), radiological exposure devices (RED), nuclear power plant, transportation or occupational accidents. A critical part of a radiological emergency response is determining the number of potentially exposed persons who need med ical treatment and the type of medical treatment they require. Handheld radiation detectors (e.g., Geiger counters) are useful for measuring external contamination (outside the body) and identifying potentially exposed persons. However, the decision to pr ovide medical treatment \u2014 and the type of medical treatment \u2014requires quick and accurate identification of internal (i.e., inside the body) contamination. CDC's Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) utilizes the Urine Radionuclide Screen (URS) to identify exp osed persons and determine the level of exp osure. URS is unique because it: Uses a small amount of urine from a single collection Maintains a steady workflow that consists of hundreds or thousands of samples, depending on the radionuclides being analyzed Provides results within 24 hours for the first 100 samples Identifies and quantifies radionuclides of public health concern These capabilities are not available anywhere else in the federal government. HHS has developed a new online diagnostic and treatment toolkit designed for health care providers, primarily physicians, who may have to provide medical care during a radiation incident. This downloadable toolkit includes e asy-to-follow procedures for diagnosis and management of radiation contamination and exposure, guidance for the use of radiation medical countermeasures, and a variety of other features to facilitate medical responses.

The FERN structure is organized to ensure federal and state inter- agency participation and cooperation in the formation, development, and operation of the network. Protecting the nation's food supply is paramount, but complicated. The exte nsive, open, interconnected, diverse, and complex structure of U.S. agriculture and food systems makes it possible targets for terrorist attacks. Several large -scale incidents in the U.S. and abroad have illustrated the potential for catastrophic health ef fects resulting from intentional contamination of the food supply. The Homeland Security Presidential Directive 9 (HSPD -9) was issued in January 2004. It established a national policy to defend the agriculture and food system against terrorist attacks, maj or disasters, and other emergencies. https://www.aphis.usda.gov/animal_health/emergency_management/downloads/hspd -9.pdf HSPD -9 addresses the need for the development of: Surveillance and monitoring systems for early detection and awareness of food contamination events Tracking systems Mitigation strategies in response to events Response planning and recovery activities that will be integrated into the Nati onal Response Plan Nation -wide laboratory networks for food, veterinary, plant health, and water quality that integrate existing federal and state laboratory resources, are interconnected, and utilize standardized diagnostic protocols and procedures USDA FOOD DEFENSE &EMERGENCY RESPONSE Food Defense is the protection of food products from intentional adulteration by biological, chemical, physical, or radiological agents.

Lead Institution: University of Minnesota, Twin Cities. 27 BIOWATCH PROGRAM The function of the BioWatch Program is to detect the release of pathogens into the air, providing warning to the government and public health community of a potential bioterror event. This system is expected to provide early warning of a pathogen release, alerting authorities before victims begin to show symptoms and providing the opportunit y to deliver treatments earlier, decreasing illness and death. While there is limited federal government description of the BioWatch Program, there have been media reports describing the functional concept. The BioWatch Program uses a series of pathogen d etectors co -located with Environmental Protection Agency air quality monitors. Aerosol samplers mounted on preexisting EPA air quality monitoring stations collect air, passing it through filters. These filters are manually collected at regular intervals a nd are analyzed by state and local health departments for potential biological weapon pathogens using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. The entire list of pathogens tested is not DETECTION SYSTEM S - BDS The distribution of letters laden with anthrax spores through the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) in 2001 established the mail as a feasible route of exposure. Within days of discovering that anthrax had been found in the mail system, the Postal Service commissioned the first ever, rapid test for biohazards in the mail system. The United States Postal Service , committed to keeping its employees and customers safe, has developed a Biohazard Detection System (BDS) that will detect anthrax in the mail. The BDS - Biohazard Detection System - employs proven technology and was designed exclusively for the Postal Service. The system is designed for the highest possible level of detection. In the event of another attack through the mail, the risk for exposure to aerosolized B. anthracis spores is presumed to be high among staff members working in a USPS processing and distribution center due to mechanical processing equipment that might generate aerosol particles. In response, USPS implemented environmental monitoring to rapidly identify the presence of B. anthracis in these centers. The BDS uses sophisticated DNA matching to detect the presence of anthrax ( Bacillus anthracis ) in the mail. It continuously collects air samples from mail canceling equipment while it is operating. Detection of B. anthracis using these validated USPS monitors would identify a likely exposure and allow prompt initiation of antimicrobial post - exposure prophylaxis ( PEP). In December 2002, the Postal Service awarded the BDS System manufacturers a pre- production co ntract to expand and continue testing the system. A contract for the initial purchase of 742 units was awarded in May of 2003. The annual expenses associated with the devices were between $75 million to $100 million. Installation was finished in 2006. Since the deployment of the BDS at all 321 Postal plants in the nation, there have been no positive alerts for anthrax. HOW DOES THE BIOHAZARD DETECTION SYSTEM FUNCTION? BDS equipment collects samples of air as the mail moves through a canceling machine. The BDS absorbs the airborne particles into a sterile water base. This creates a liquid sample that can be tested. The liquid sample is injected into a cartridge, and the automated test for a DNA match is performed. Note : All the BDS processes are automated . The BDS unit consists of an air -collection hood, a cabinet where the collection and analysis devices are housed, a local computer network connection, and a site controller - a networked computer. Why is the BDS Needed? The BDS will enable early identi fication of anthrax providing for a rapid response. BDS helps us maintain our commitment to keep employees and customers safe. 29 What is the Science Behind the Biohazard Detection System? The core of the system is PCR. It is a process that essentially \" photocopies\" the genes of a sample and compares the sample to a template for the anthrax DNA sequence to see if there is a match. When is a BDS Test Complete? After approximately 90 minutes - one hour for the air collection process and 30 minutes to test the air sample. Since air sample collections are continuous, test results will be known every hour after the initial test. How Many Air Samples Are Taken During the Day? Continuous air collection will take place while the mail canceling operation is underway. There are no gaps. How Do You Find Out if There is a Positive Match? If there is a DNA match, the BDS computer network conveys that information to the site controller computer. The red stack -light and horn at the BDS cabinet alerts personnel of a positive result. Can the BDS Equipment Test for Other Biohazards? For purposes of nationwide deployment, the system is fully capable of testing for anthrax. The system is \"expandable,\" so, in the future, it could be adapted to test for other biologic al threats. WHAT IS THE BIOHAZAR D SYSTEM'S IMPACT ON MAIL PROCESSING? BDS does not slow down mail processing equipment. If the BDS tests positive for anthrax, mail will be retained at the impacted facility until it is safe for delivery. If operations a re suspended at a facility, new mail will be diverted to other mail processing facilities and delivery operations will proceed from there. WHAT IS THE PROCEDUR E IF A BIOHAZARD IS DETECTED? What Happens When the Alarm Goes Off? If test results indicate the presence of a biohazard, the BDS alerts designated site personnel through automated procedures and the red stack -light and horn at the BDS cabinet will sound. Designated site personnel will then activate the emergency action plan. Employees and custom ers will be evacuated from the building. 30 Once the Postal Employees are Outside the Building, What Will Be Done for Their Safety? Supervisors will call the roll and make sure everyone in the building has been evacuated. They will explain the nature of the incident, and everyone will wait for direction from community emergency response personnel. Will Medication Be Offered? Local public health officials will determine the need for medication based on results of additional tests of the positive BDS sample by the designated local public health lab. When Will an Outside Lab Result be Available? Results of the initial test, ver ifying the positive sample, will be available approximately eight hours after the BDS alert. Results of the second test, a plate culture test, will be available usually within 24 to 48 hours after the BDS alert. o Note : The Department of Homeland Security w ill be notified of a positive test result. Biosafety is the combination of appropriate work practices, safety equipment (including personal protective equipment (PPE) ), and facility design employed to contain potentially infectious microorganisms and hazardous biological materials (e.g., toxins), to reduce the exposure risk to workers, the environment and the public and to prevent laboratory acquired infections (LAIs). Some infectious organisms present in patient specimens can be highly infectious and can result in serious or even fatal illnesses. There is always some risk when working with infectious agents, therefore the goal of a good biosafety program is to reduce the risk to an acceptable level. The acceptable level will be determined by the Laboratory Director and institutional management, and can vary depending on risk tolerance levels and institutional polices. BIOSAFETY LEVELS There are four biosafety levels (BSLs), BSL -1 through BSL- 4, with BSL providing the lowest level of protection and BSL -4 providing the highest level of protectio n. Biosafety levels consist of a combination of laboratory practices and techniques, safety equipment and laboratory facilities. You may hear biosafety levels described as the level of containment necessary for certain types of work or working with speci fic microorganisms. At its very essence, the practices, equipment and facility criteria designated for each BSL are intended to contain the infectious organisms to prevent exposure to the workers and the environment. At a minimum, clinical laboratories that perform high complexity microbiology should be BSL -2 labs. Some clinical labs might be at a BSL -3 level due to their work with agents that carry a high risk of causing a serious infection if inhaled, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The Biosafet y in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL), 5th Edition (download it at: http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/index.htm ) describes the different biosafety lev els in detail. It also lists standard microbiological practices that laboratorians should follow in their daily work. Some of the practices and techniques, safety equipment and PPE (primary barriers), and facility design and construction safeguards (seco ndary barriers) for BSL -2 and BSL -3 laboratories are included here. SAFE LABORATORY PRAC TICES In a laboratory, many standard safety practices should be a part of the lab- specific safety manual and should be practiced daily by employees. Each laboratory wor ker plays a large role in their own protection. Improperly using safety equipment and not following safety protocols can lead to safety breaches. This list includes some of the key standard microbiological practices. For a full list, see the Biosafety L evel 1, 2, and 3 sections of the BMBL, 5th edition. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 32 1. Before beginning any new procedure or handling a new organism, it is very important to perform a risk assessment. Please see the risk assessment section of this manual for more details. 2. Limit access - Only authorized personnel should be able to enter work areas. 3. Wash hands - Always wash hands after handling a sample or organism and before leaving the lab. 4. No eating, drinking, handling contact lenses, applying cosmetics or storing food in the laboratory. 5. No mouth or eye contact - Touching these areas could cause accidental ingestion or mucous membrane exposure. Consider policies to restrict the use of personal electronic devices. 6. Avoid using sharps whenever possible. Substitute plastic for glass when fe asible. Have procedures addressing disposal. 7. Limit or contain aerosols. 8. Decontaminate work surfaces. 9. Decontaminate infectious waste. 10. Post biohazard warning signs to inform workers they are entering a biohazardous area. 11. Implement a pest management prog ram. 12. Ensure effective training in procedures and biosafety. BSL -2 (See BSL2_Checklist_for_Clinical_Laboratories_090815 Job Aid ) 1. Ensure laboratory personnel have specific training and demonstrate proficiency prior to handling pathogenic agents. 2. Restrict access to the laboratory while work is being performed. 3. Perform all procedures involving infectious materials, which may produce an aerosol or splash, inside a biological safety cabinet (BSC) or other physical containment device. 4. Post warning signs incorporating the universal biohazard symbol at the entrance to the laboratory and on containers of potentially infectious materials as specified in the OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard 29 CFR 1910.1030. 5. Develop and implement policies for the safe handling of sharps. 6. The facility should have a comprehensive and lab -specific biosafety manual that includes how waste is decontaminated and medical surveillance policies. 7. PPE should include long cuffed -sleeved and closed lab coats, gloves, and face and eye protection as identified by your facility's risk assessment. 8. A handwashing sink and eyewash station must be available. Persons must wash their hands after working with potentially infectious materials, when gloves are contaminated and befo re leaving the laboratory. 9. Personnel must be trained on the precautions to prevent exposure as well as the emergency procedures to follow in the event of an exposure. Medical surveillance and appropriate immunizations must be offered. 10. Decontaminate all wo rk surfaces with appropriate disinfectant after completion of work and after any spill or splash of potentially infectious material. 11. Decontaminate all cultures, stocks, and other potentially infectious materials using an effective method before disposal. D epending on where the decontamination will be performed, the following methods should be used prior to transport: 33 a. Place materials to be decontaminated outside of the immediate laboratory in a durable, leak proof container and secured for transport. b. Pack ma terials to be removed from the facility for decontamination in accordance with applicable local, state, and federal regulations. Note : Not having an autoclave in the immediate lab does not exclude the lab from being designated as a BSL - 2. Using an autocl ave somewhere else in the facility or sending waste out for destruction and disposal by an outside vendor is acceptable as long as it is packed and transported in accordance with all applicable local, state and federal regulations. BSL -3 (See BSL3_Checklist_for_Clinical_Laboratories_090815 Job Aid ) 1. Meet all BSL -2 criteria. 2. Conduct all manipulations of infectious materials within a BSC or other containment device. Never manipulate infectious material on an open bench. 3. Restrict access to the laboratory to authorized personnel. 4. Decontaminate all waste before leaving the facility for final treatment and/or disposal. 5. Decontaminate reusable PPE (e.g., PAPR) before reuse. Decontaminate reusable laboratory clothing (e.g., scrubs) before laundering. 6. Additional PPE may include a solid -front wrap around gown, gloves, face and eye protection, and respiratory protection as indicated by the risk assessment. 7. The lab is physically separated from areas that are open to unrestric ted traffic flow. 8. Entry into the BSL -3 is through two self -closing and lockable doors and may include an anteroom. 9. Ensure air exhausted from the lab isn't recirculated to any other area of the building (single pass). 10. Maintain and monitor sustained direct ional inward airflow into the laboratory. 11. Ensure a hands -free hand washing sink is located near the lab's exit. 34 LABORATORY EXPOSURES AND LAB ACQUIRED INF ECTIONS (LAI s) Laboratory exposures and Laboratory Acquired Infections (LAIs) can occur from a breakd own of the established safety protocols. More stringent safety protocols, aerosol prevention and containment are often associated with agents of bioterrorism, but other more common infectious organisms can also cause LAIs. Routinely following established safety protocols for all patient samples (i.e., Standard Precautions and site - specific safety measures based on risk assessments) will help to protect against LAIs. Your facility should also have an official surveillance mechanism for reporting, monitori ng and treating LAIs. The most predominant routes of transmission that cause LAIs and suggestions for addressing them: 1. Sticks or cuts with contaminated needles or other sharps a. Remove glass and sharps from your procedures when possible. b. Have procedures for proper sharps use and disposal, if used. 2. Spills or splashes directly onto skin or mucous membranes (eyes, nose, mouth) a. Provide PPE to workers and ensure they are trained to use it properly. b. Have procedures for addressing spills and splashes. 3. Ingestion a. Make sure workers know that mouth pipetting is never acceptable. b. Avoid touching the face while in the lab. c. Practice frequent hand washing. 4. Indirect exposure through touching the mouth or eyes with contaminated fingers or objects (fomites) a. Train workers on the proper procedures and precautions to prevent exposures including PPE usage/doffing and hand washing. b. Avoid touching the face while in the lab. 5. Animal bites or scratches (i.e., research facilities where animals are kept) 6. Inhalation of infectious aerosols a. Work inside a BSC when there is a risk of a splash or creating an aerosol. b. Use appropriate procedures and containment devices to avoid creating an aerosol. Data suggests that infectious aerosols play a large role in LAIs. These sources of LAIs, especiall y aerosol prevention and containment, should be addressed in your laboratory's safety manual. 35 AEROSOL AND DROPLET PRODUCTION Any procedure which imparts energy to a microbial suspension can produce aerosols or droplets, which may contain infectious organisms. Aerosols are very small particles that may remain suspended in the air and can be inhaled and retained in the lungs. Droplets are larger particles which settle onto surfaces and gloves due to gravity. Droplets may also come into contact with the mu cous membranes of the person performing the procedure. Sealed containers, sealed rotors, centrifuge safety cups and bio logical safety cabinets should be used to mitigate the risk of creating aerosols and droplets. Some of the most commonly recognized procedures which can cause aerosols and droplets and ways to mitigate the risks are listed below. 1. Pipetting a. Perform work inside a BSC. b. Do not forcibly expel the last drop of fluid from the pipette tip. Instead, place the tip against the inside wall of the vessel and expel the last drop as gently as possible. c. Pipette volumes are calibrated to be accurate at the first \"To Deliver\" stop. There is no need to continue to push to the \"Expel\" stop to preserve pipetting accuracy. d. Instead of mixing a dilution or sample with a pipette, cap the tube and use a vortex mixer. e. Never direct the pipette stream into the middle of the well or container, instead touch the tip to the inside of the well or container. This reduces the energy and splashing. f. Use aerosol resistan t pipette tips to protect against contamination inside the pipette. g. Drips that hit a hard surface can produce an aerosol and droplets. Use plastic backed bench pads to absorb and contain any falling drips. When possible, lower the pipette tip toward the bench pad before the drip falls to reduce the distance and amount of energy. 2. Tubes and vessels - Breaking films and opening containers a. Breaking or popping thin films in the neck of containers can cause aerosols and droplets. Instead, recap the tube and centrifuge it. b. If centrifugation is not possible because of the vessel type, then cover the opening with an absorbent material and insert a pipette under the material to break the film. Discard the pipette and the absorbent material with the contaminated wa ste. c. Plug or pop top microcentrifuge tubes can produce splatter when they are opened. Using screw cap tubes will minimize splatter. d. Before opening microcentrifuge tubes, quickly spin them in your centrifuge to remove excess fluid from the lid. e. Open micro centrifuge tube inside a BSC whenever possible. f. To open plug top tubes, cover the plug with an absorbent material moistened with alcohol, point the tube away from your face and open it inside a BSC or other containment device. Dispose of the absorbent mat erial with the contaminated waste. 3. Vortex mixing a. Never vortex an open container or tube. Always securely close containers before vortexing. b. Use caution when opening containers following vortexing since fluid may have reached the lid. Either quick spin the tube in a centrifuge or cover the lid with absorbent material moistened with an appropriate disinfectant. Dispose of the absorbent material with the contaminated waste. 36 c. Open containers inside a BSC whenever possible. 4. Performing catalase test a. Perform catalase testing inside a BSC, a closed tube, or a closed petri dish. b. For the tube catalase testing method, place organism growth onto the wall of a test tube. Run the catalase reagent down the opposite wall and into the bottom of the tube. Cap the tube. Tilt the tube so the reagent touches the organism. Read the result. 5. MALDI -TOF Identification a. If your laboratory us es Mass Spectrometry (MALDI -TOF ) for bacterial identification, and if the manufacturer provides your facility with an alternate tube extraction method, it is recommended that the resulting extract be filtered using a 0.2 u (or less) filter. This additional step is recommended to reduce the chance of laboratory contamination with viable bacteria and spores. 37 BSL-3 PRACTICES AND WHEN TO USE BSL -3 PRACTICES IN A BSL -2 LABORATORY BSL -3 PRACTICES 1. Restrict access to the laboratory. 2. Wear additional PPE (solid -front gown, gloves and face/eye protection as a minimum). 3. Lab personnel must demonstrate proficiency prior to handling pathogenic and potentially lethal agents, and must be supervised by scientists experienced and competent in handling the specific infectious agents present in the lab and associated procedures. 4. Do not manipulate organisms or work in open vessels on the bench - All work must take place in a BSC or other containment equipment. 5. Evaluate all potential exposures immediately. 6. Decontaminate all cultures, stocks and other potentially infectious materials prior to disposal by using an approved decontamination method, such as autoclaving or chemical disinfection. Decontamination would preferably take place within the Laboratory. WHEN TO USE BSL -3 PRACTICES IN A BSL -2 LABORATORY 1. When working with agents tha t can be transmitted via inhalation and are normally handled at BSL -3, but a BSL -3 laboratory is not readily available. 2. When the laboratory director determines that these practices are needed based on a risk assessment 3. When specific high- risk pathogenic or ganisms are suspected CABINET US AGE AND TESTING Clinical laboratories should have at least one Clas s II BSC. Training on proper BSC usage must be given to laboratorians before they are allowed to work in a BSC. Without proper training, users can unknowingly put themselves at risk. The training should include what to do if there is a power or BSC fail ure while they are working with samples in the BSC. WHEN TO USE A BSC The BSC should be used when your facility's management has determined it to be necessary. At a minimum, the BSC should be used any time you are working with an infectious agent where: 1. Procedures with potential for creating infectious aerosols or splashes are conducted. 2. The infectious agent is present in large volumes or high concentrations. 3. The organism is suspected to be highly infectious, especially through inhalation (airborne) ro ute of transmission. 4. The suspected organism is believed to cause severe or fatal infections. 38 WHERE TO PLACE YOUR BSC Where your BSC is located is important. When used properly, the inward airflow and air filtration in the Class II BSC are designed to protect the user, the product and the environment. However, this airflow can be easily disrupted by improper personnel practices and by its surroundings. When placing a new BSC or moving an existing BSC, make sure to locate the BSC away from other work a nd high traffic areas. Also locate it away from air supply ducts and lab entry doors. If your BSC is currently located near one of these sources of air disturbances, try to mitigate air disruption while work is occurring in the BSC. Close doors and post signs to minimize personnel walking past the BSC. Directional air diffusers may be an option to direct airflow away from the BSC. BSC CERTIFICATION RE QUIREMENTS All BSCs must be certified at least annually by a trained professional to meet Annex F of A NSI/NSF Standard 49 requirements. Annual certification ensures that the BSC is functioning properly. Additionally, if the BSC is moved then the unit must be re- certified before it can be used. Do not use any BSC which has not been properly certified. BSC SAFE USAGE PARAMET ERS 1. If your BSC doesn't run all the time, then turn it on and allow it to run for 10 minutes before use. Decontaminate the work surface, rear wall, sides, and inside front window of the BSC with a fresh 1:10 household bleach* solution f ollowed by 70% alcohol (or water). Use a \"Swiffer\" type tool to clean the back wall, if needed. Do not put your head inside the BSC to clean it. 2. Check the sash level to ensure it is set to the correct height and make sure the alarms and blower are on. 3. Check the differential pressure (e.g., magnehelic) gauge, if present, to ensure there has not been a large change from the previous usage. Record this number on your BSC usage sheet. Large changes in the pressure gauge can indicate that the HEPA filter has been breached or blocked. Don't use the BSC if this occurs, call for service. 4. Use a strip of tissue paper or a smoke stick to check for inward airflow. 5. Adjust your chair height so that your face is above the front sash opening and your underarms are near the bottom of the glass screen. 6. Gather all of the items that you will need and place them in the BSC. Only place items that you must have into the BSC. Too many items will disturb the airflow. 7. Put a small waste disposal and sharps container inside the B SC. 8. Make sure that the front or back airflow vents (i.e., grills) are not blocked. 9. Don't use volatile or highly flammable chemicals inside the BSC. BSCs are not designed to clean chemical vapors from the air and they are not spark proof. Also, don't use open flames in the BSC. 10. Only one person should work inside the BSC at a time. More than one person can disturb the airflow. 11. Move your hands straight into and out of the BSC (perpendicular to the cabinet). 12. Keep clean items separate from dirty items. (e.g. , clean items on your left and dirty on your right.) 13. Work 4 -6 inches into the BSC. This is where the airflow is optimal for protecting the user and the work product. 39 14. Work in a slow and methodical manner. Don't make any sweeping motions with your arms. 15. Clean up spills promptly with a disinfectant effective against the infectious agent that is present * From Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories: To be an effective disinfectant, working bleach solutions must contain >0.5% but <2% sodium hypochlorite. Hypochlorite concentration in household bleach varies by manufacturer. Many household bleach solutions contain 5.25% sodium hypochlorite, and a 1:10 produce a 0.53% hypochlorite soluti on. Use of bleach solutions with lower hypochlorite concentrations might not provide the proper level of disinfection. Each day, prepare a fresh 1:10 household bleach solution. ONCE WORK IS COMPLETE - BSC CLEANUP 1. Disinfect all materials with a fresh 1:10 household bleach * solution before removing them from the BSC. This includes the outsides of plates, carriers and pipettors. 2. Close the biohazard waste bag and disinfect the outside before removing it from the BSC. 3. Leave the BSC running for 10 minutes to c lear all aerosols and infectious substances. 4. Decontaminate the work surface, rear wall, sides, and inside front window of the BSC with a fresh 1:10 household bleach* solution followed by 70% alcohol (or water). Use a \"Swiffer\" type tool to clean the back wall, if needed. Do not put your head inside the BSC to clean it . DEMONSTRATING INWARD BSC AIRFLOW USING A SMOKE STICK 1. Pass the smoke stick along the entire perimeter of the BSC work opening, approximately 1.5 inches outside of the cabinet. 2. Pay particular attention to corners and vertical edges. 3. The smoke should be drawn into the front grill. When testing closer to the sash, the smoke will look curlier since it is farther from the grill. Note : Don't hold the smoke stick any further than 1.5 inc hes outside of the BSC. The BSC is not designed to draw air in from great distances outside of the BSC. DISINFECTING WORK SU RFACES 1. Clean work surfaces and work items before work is set up and after work is completed. This includes work benches, timers, pens, telephones and any other surfaces that have been touched by a sample or a gloved hand. 2. Instructions for disinfecting these work surfaces must be part of the labs Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The SOP should detail what disinfectant to use, w hat PPE to wear, how to clean the surfaces, what contact time is required and how to dispose of the cleaning materials. 3. If possible, post these cleaning instructions in the bench area for easy reference. 4. Typically a freshly made 1:10 household bleach* solution followed by a 70% alcohol dilution is sufficient to disinfect most surfaces. If your facility has another disinfectant that is more suited to the work being performed or surfaces being cleaned, then it may be used instead. 40 5. In general, remove gro ss contamination before applying disinfectant. Disinfectants are less effective with organic material present. Allow dried blood or body fluid at least 20 minutes of contact with the bleach solution or other approved disinfectant before clean- up. SPILL CLE ANUP 1. Clean up spills immediately. Put on appropriate PPE: gown, gloves, shoe covers and facemask as needed. 2. Cover the spill with an absorbent material such as paper towels. 3. In general, remove gross contamination before applying disinfectant. Disinfectants are less effective with organic material present. 4. Gently pour a freshly made 1:10 household bleach* solution around the outside of the spill. Continue to go around the spill while decreasing the size of the circle until the whole spill, from outside to inside, is covered in bleach. 5. Let sit for 20 minutes (or for the appropriate contact time based on the disinfectant used). 6. Remove all spill cleanup materials and place them with the infectious waste for proper disposal. 7. Wipe down the area with a freshly made 1:10 household bleach * solution, followed by 70% alcohol. 8. Put the remaining cleanup materials and PPE into the infectious waste disposal. CREATING A CULTURE O F SAFETY (A Biosafety Checklist: Developing A Culture of Biosafety ) Establishing a culture of safety begins with the support of the facility's management. Laboratory safety must become an integral part of your laboratory's every day operations and an obvious priority for your organization. Management embracing the impo rtance of safety and providing guidance and infrastructure support will foster safe behavior among the employees. In order to establish a culture of safety, facilities need to: 1. Establish and enforce laboratory safety policies. 2. Conduct risk assessments to identify potential hazards and specify practices and procedures to mitigate or reduce the risk of exposure to those hazards. 3. Ensure that personnel understand how to perform a risk assessment and identify hazards in their work environment. 4. Ensure all personnel are trained to safely perform their work including practices to minimize identified risks. Observe them to ensure they are competently performing these techniques. 5. Provide a non- punitive avenue for workers to identify risks and communicate concerns and mitigation strategies to management without fear of punishment. DECONTAMINATION OF S ELECT AGENTS ISOLATE D IN THE CLINICAL LA BORATORY (See DecontaminationSelectAgents_JobAid_10_06_2015_Final Job Aid ) Select agents ( www.selectagents.gov ) cannot be directly discarded into the biohazardous waste stream like other regulated infectious medical waste materials. Select Agent regulations detailed in 7 CFR 331, 9 CFR 121 and 4 2 CFR 73 dictate that select agents may only be held more than 7 days from confirmation by facilities that are registered and approved by CDC and/or USDA to possess those specific select agents. Once an isolate 41 from a patient specimen in the clinical lab has been confirmed by the local Laboratory Response Network (LRN) Reference Laboratory as a select agent, the non- registered clinical lab must destroy all relevant patient specimens and cultures remaining in their possession, or transfer them to the neares t LRN laboratory that is registered for those select agents. If a clinical lab decides to destroy the patient specimens and cultures, inactivation using an on -site autoclave or chemical decontamination must be performed before transport to a medical wast e contractor for destruction and disposal. Chemical Decontamination Process 1. Prepare a fresh 1:10 household bleach* solution in a receptacle large enough to submerge all containers/plates containing select agents. 2. Working in a BSC, completely immerse open culture containers in the bleach solution and leave containers in bleach solution overnight. 3. Once overnight inactivation is complete, turn the sink faucet on and discard the bleach solution down the drain with running tap water. 4. Package the inactivated c ulture plates and containers with other biohazardous waste that is transported off site by a medical waste management contractor for final treatment and disposal. If a clinical lab chooses to transfer the relevant specimens and cultures, lab personnel will need to work with the LRN Reference Laboratory to ensure that the proper paperwork and transfer protocols are followed in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal shipping regulations. Note : If an organism is subcultured from a blood cul ture bottle and a LRN Reference Laboratory confirms the organism as a select agent or the patient is diagnosed with smallpox or a VHF , the blood culture bottles and any additional bottles that would contain the organism, must be decontaminated before transport off site. The contents in these bottles cannot be adequately decontaminated using chemical decontamination and must be autoclaved on site. If the facility does not have an autoclave on site, all positive blood culture bottles must be transferred to the closest LRN Reference Laboratory registered and approved to accept the select agent.

Use of bleach so lutions with lower hypochlorite concentrations might not provide the proper level of disinfection. Each day, prepare a fresh 1:10 household bleach solution. 42 BIOLOGICAL RISK ASSE SSMENT The purpose of a biological risk assessment (RA) is to identify the hazards associated with handling infectious agents in the laboratory and to identify and implement controls in order to minimize the risk of exposure to workers and the environment. In the clinical lab, biological risk as sessments focus primarily on the prevention of laboratory -acquired needle non -intact skin Ingestion (contamination from surfac es, fomites to hands) Laboratory acquired infection prevention is accomplished by blocking the routes of transmission and breaking the chain of infection. The use of engineering controls, safety equipment, administrative controls, proper work practices, and p ersonal protective equipment (PPE) are the primary means of preventing transmission of the organisms to a portal of entry in the host (i.e., lungs, non -intact skin, GI tract, mucous membranes). These controls can be followed by vaccination and/or treatment . Surveys of clinical laboratories have revealed that exposure to aerosols was a plausible but unconfirmed source of infection in 80% of LAIs. The results indicated that Brucella spp. and N. meningitidis were the greatest risk to clinical microbiologists. The analysis of two studies, spanning 1979 -2004, revealed 31 cases of invasive N.meningitidis infection which resulted in 11 fatalities (>35% mortality). Some other organisms that have caused LAIs in clinical laboratories are: Arboviruses Coxiella burnetii Hantavirus Hepatitis Salmonella spp. Shigella spp. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 43 A risk assessment (RA) requires management involvement and support, knowledge of the hazards, and understanding of the work, the environment , and the staff. Ideally, a multidisciplinary team (depending on the work) will be involved in the RA process. That team should include: Laboratory staff Management/supervisors Health and safety specialists (biosafety, occupational health, etc.) Facility staff Scientists with unique expertise and experience with the potential hazards (i.e., microbiologists, molecular biologists, chemists) Veterinarians (if animal work) COMPLETE A RISK ASSE SSMENT WHEN: There is an incident, accident or exposure. Changes occur such as: o Moving, renovation or building a facility. o Working with a new infectious agent or reagent. o Using a new piece of equipment, a new technique or procedure. o New scientific information becomes available. 44 RISK ASSESSMENT: A 5 -STEP PROC ESS INVOLVING HAZARD IDENTIFICATION AND HAZARD CONTROL STEP 1: IDENTIFY HAZ ARDS How do you know what to include in a biological risk assessment? The 5 P's can help! Each P represents a process or category that needs to be assessed. 1. Pathogen (Agent), e.g., infectious dose, virulence factors, route of transmission, etc. 2. Procedures, e.g., centrifugation, generation of aerosols, sharps, waste management, etc. 3. Place (laboratory facility/environment), e.g., research, clinical, production, workflow, equi pment, etc. 4. People, e.g., immune status, behavioral factors 5. Personal Protective Equipment, type? hazard or protection? STEP 2: EVALUATE AND PRIORITIZE RISKS Evaluate and prioritize risks based on the probability and consequences of exposure. Consider how likely the situation is to occur and how severe would the consequences be. Use a risk matrix to help prioritize risks, then determine acceptable risk and protect against unacceptable risk. STEP 3: MITIGATE RIS K Mitigate risk by determining controls to reduce the risk. The hierarchy of controls consists of: 1. Engineering controls (e.g., safety equipment and facility design). 2. Administrative controls and work practices (e.g., training, medical surveillance, SOPs, minimizing aerosols, frequent hand washing ). 3. PPE (as a last resort). STEP 4: IMPLEMENT CO NTROL MEASURES STEP 5: REVIEW RISK ASSESSMENT Evaluating the effectiveness of the controls and adjust the control plans when necessary. Identify Hazards Evaluate Risk Mitigate RiskImplement ControlsReview Risk Assessment 45 JOB HAZARD ANALYSIS One approach to completing a risk assessment is b y doing a job hazard analysis : 1. Break procedure down into individual components. 2. Determine hazard(s) associated with individual component (hazard ID). 3. Identify way to deal with each hazard (hazard control). In conclusion, there is risk in everything that we do. Know the hazards Ask questions Don't forget your staff, their expertise and trainin g 46 BIOSECURITY BASICS BIOSECURITY DEFINED Biosafety and biosecurity are related, but not identical, concepts. Biosafety programs reduce the risk of exposure of individuals and the environment to potentially hazardous biological agents. Biosafety is achieved by implementing various degrees of laboratory control and containment, through laboratory design and access restrictions, personnel expertise and training, use of containment equipment, and safe methods of managing infectious materials in a laboratory setting. The objecti ve of biosecurity is to prevent loss, theft or misuse of microorganisms, biological materials, and research -related information. This is accomplished by implementing policies and procedures, tracking inventory, and limiting and monitoring access to facilities, biological materials and information. While the objectives are different, biosafety and biosecurity measures are usually complementary. BIOSECURITY AND SELE CT AGENTS Select Agents and toxins are pathogens or biological toxins that have been declared by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS/CDC) and by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety and to the economy. The possession, use, and transfer of select agent s are highly regulated and there is a greater emphasis on biosecurity. Typically, clinical laboratories are not required to register with the Select Agent Program. Excluding the Select Agent regulations, there is no current federal requirement for the dev elopment of a biosecurity program and as such the recommendations presented here are advisory. However, hospital laboratories possess many highly infectious and potentially dangerous organisms and the application of these principles and the assessment proc ess may enhance overall laboratory management. Designing a biosecurity program that does not interfere with laboratory operations requires a familiarity with microbiology and the materials that require protection. Protecting pathogens and other sensitive biological materials while preserving the free exchange of research materials and information may present significant institutional challenges. Therefore, a tiered approach to protecting biological materials, commensurate with the identified risks, often p rovides the best resolution to conflicts that may arise. However, in the absence of legal requirements for a biosecurity program, the health and safety of laboratory personnel and the surrounding environment should take precedence over biosecurity concerns . Biosafety - Protects people from dangerous pathogens. Biosecurity - Protects pathogens from dangerous people. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 47 RISK MANAGEMENT Risk analysis can be used to identify the need for a biosecurity program. A risk management approach to laboratory biosecurity can help establish if any agents would require biosecurity measures to prevent loss, theft, diversion, or i ntentional misuse and would help ensure that the protective measures provided, and the costs associated with that protection, are proportional to the risk. The need for a biosecurity program should be based on the possible impact of the theft, loss, diversion, or intentional misuse of the materials, recognizing that different agents and toxins will pose different levels of risk. Risks need to be identified, prioritized and resources allocated based on that prioritization. Not all institutions will rank the same agent at the same risk level. Risk management methodology takes into consideration available institutional resources and the risk tolerance of the institution. EXAMPLE GUIDANCE: A BIOSECURITY RISK ASS ESSMENT AND MANAGEME NT PROCESS Different models exist regarding biosecurity risk assessment. Most models share common components such as asset identification, threat, vulnerability and mitigation. What follows is one example of how a biosecurity risk assessment may be conducted. In this example, the ent ire risk assessment and risk management process may be divided into five main steps, each of which can be further subdivided: 1. Identify, inventory, and prioritize assets. 2. Assess potential threats and vulnerabilities. 3. Analyze the risk of specific security scenarios. 4. Design and develop an overall risk management program. 5. Regularly evaluate the institution's risk posture and protection objectives. Example guidance for these five steps is provided below. STEP 1: IDENTIFY, INVENTORY AND PRIORITI ZE ASSETS: Identify the biological materials that exist at the institution, form of the material, location and quantities, including non -replicating materials (i.e., toxins). Familiarize yourself with the Select Agent list and verify that you do not have any stored in your lab. Contact your State Public Health Laboratory for guidance if you believe you have any. Identify sensitive information, equipment, personnel, and other materials that are important. Evaluate the potential for misuse of these biologic materials and other assets. Evaluate the consequences of misuse of these biologic materials and other assets. Prioritize the biologic materials and other assets based on the consequences of misuse (i.e., risk of malicious use). At this point, an institution may fi nd that none of its biologic materials and other assets merit the development and implementation of a separate biosecurity program or that the existing security at the facility is adequate. In this event, no additional steps would need to be completed. 48 STEP 2: ASSESS POTENTI AL THREATS AND VULNE RABILITIES: Determine how undesired events might occur. Determine how unauthorized access might occur. o Identify the types of \"Insiders\" who may pose a threat to the biologic materials at the institution. o Identify the types of \"Outsiders\" (if any) who may pose a threat to the biologic materials at the institution. o Evaluate the motive, means, and opportunity of these various potential adversaries. Identify protective measures in place and how they could be breached ( e.g., vulnerabilities). STEP 3: ANALYZE THE RISK OF SPECIFIC SEC URITY SCENARIOS: Develop a list of possible biosecurity scenarios, or undesired events that could occur at the institution (each scenario is a combination of an agent, an adversary, and an a ction). Consider: o Access to the agent within your laboratory. o How the undesired event could occur. o Protective measures already in place to prevent the occurrence. o How the existing protection measures could be breached. Evaluate the probability of each sc enario materializing (e.g., the likelihood) and its associated consequences. Assumptions include: o A wide range of threats are possible, but certain threats are more probable than others. o All agents/assets are not equally attractive to an adversary. o Valid and credible threats, existing precautions, and the potential need for select enhanced precautions are considered. Prioritize or rank the scenarios by risk for review by management. STEP 4: DEVELOP AN O VERALL RISK MANAGEME NT PROGRAM: Management co mmits to oversight, implementation, training and maintenance of the biosecurity program. Management develops a biosecurity risk statement, documenting which biosecurity scenarios represent an unacceptable risk and must be mitigated versus those risks appr opriately handled through existing protection controls. Management develops a biosecurity plan to describe how the institution will mitigate those unacceptable risks including: o A written security plan, standard operating procedures, and incident response plans. o Written protocols for employee training on potential hazards, the biosecurity program and incident response plans. Management ensures necessary resources to achieve the protection measures documented in the biosecurity plan. Management assures th e daily implementation, training and annual re- evaluation of the security program. 49 STEP 5: RE- EVALUATE THE INSTITU TION'S RISK POSTURE AND PROTECTION OBJEC TIVES: Management regularly reevaluates and makes necessary modifications to the: o Biosecurity risk statement. o Biosecurity risk assessment process. o The institution's biosecurity program/plan. o The institution's biosecurity systems. Management re- evaluates the plan and documents how to address the issues: o At least annually o Routine review o After any biosecu rity-related incident o After plan audits o After drills/exercises DEVELOPING A BIOSECU RITY PROGRAM Management, researchers and laboratory supervisors must be committed to being responsible stewards of infectious agents and toxins. Development of a biosecurity program should be a collaborative process involving all stakeholders. The stakeholders include staff who work in the laboratory as well as staff who are associated with laboratory operations. The involvement of organizations and/or personnel responsible for a facility's overall security is critical because many potential biosecurity measures may already be in place as part of an existing safety or security program. This coordinated approach is critical in ensuring that the biosecurity program p rovides reasonable, timely and cost -effective solutions to address the identified security risks without unduly affecting the scientific or business enterprise or the provision of clinical and/or diagnostic services. The need for a biosecurity program sho uld reflect sound risk management practices based on a site- specific risk assessment. A biosecurity risk assessment should analyze the probability and consequences of loss, theft and potential misuse of pathogens and toxins. Most importantly, the biosecuri ty risk assessment should be used as the basis for making risk management decisions. ELEMENTS OF A BIOSEC URITY PROGRAM After you perform a risk assessment for your facility you may determine that your current safety and security programs provide adequate security. This section offers examples and suggestions for components of a biosecurity program should the risk assessment reveal that further protections may be warranted. Program components should be site -specific and based upon an organizational threat/ vulnerability assessment. Elements discussed below should be implemented, as needed, based upon the risk assessment process. They should not be construed as \"minimum requirements\" or \"minimum standards\" for a biosecurity program. 50 Program Management If a biosecurity plan is implemented, institutional management must support it. Appropriate authority must be delegated for implementation and the necessary resources provided to assure program goals are being met. An organizational structure for the biosecur ity program that clearly defines the chain of command, roles, and responsibilities should be distributed to the staff. Program management should ensure that biosecurity plans are created, exercised, and revised as needed. The biosecurity program should be integrated into relevant institutional policies and plans. Physical Security \u2014Access Control and Monitoring The physical security elements of a laboratory biosecurity program are intended to prevent the removal of assets for non -official purposes. An eval uation of the physical security measures should include a thorough review of the building and premises, the laboratories, and biological material storage areas. Many of the requirements for a biosecurity plan may already exist in a facility's overall security plan. Access should be limited to authorized and designated employees based on the need to enter sensitive areas. Methods for limiting access could be as simple as locking doors or having a key card system in place. Evaluations of the levels of access should consider all facets of the laboratory's operations and programs (e.g., laboratory entrance requirements, freezer access). The need for entry by visitors, laboratory workers, management officials, students, cleaning/maintenance staff, and emergency response personnel should be considered. Personnel Management Personnel management includes identifying the roles and responsibilities for employees who handle, use, store and transport dangerous pathogens and/or other important assets. The effectiveness of a biosecurity program against identified threats depends, first and foremost, on the integrity of those individuals who have access to pathogens, toxins, sensitive information and/or other assets. Employee screening policies and procedures are used to help evaluate these individuals. Policies should be developed for personnel and visitor identification, visitor management, access procedures, and reporting of security incidents. Inventory and Accountability Material accountability procedures should be established to track the inventory, storage, use, transfer and destruction of dangerous biological materials and assets when no longer needed. The objective is to know what agents exist at a facility, where they are located, and who is responsible for them . To achieve this, management should define: 1) the materials (or forms of materials) subject to accountability measures; 2) records to be maintained, update intervals and timelines for record maintenance; 3) operating procedures associated with inventory maintenance (e.g., how material is identified, where it can be used and stored); and 4) documentation and reporting requirements. It is important to emphasize that microbiological agents are capable of replication and are often cultivated to accommodate t he nature of the work involving their use. Therefore, knowing the exact \"working\" quantity of organisms at any given time may be impractical. Depending on the risks associated with a pathogen or toxin, 51 management can designate an individual who is accounta ble, knowledgeable about the materials in use, and responsible for security of the materials under his or her control. Information Security Policies should be established for handling sensitive information associated with the biosecurity program. For the purpose of these policies, \"sensitive information\" is that which is related to the security of pathogens and toxins, or other critical infras tructure information. Examples of sensitive information may include facility security plans, access control codes, agent inventories and storage locations. Discussion of information security in this section does not pertain to information which has been de signated \"classified\" by the United States pursuant to Executive Order 12958, as amended, and is governed by United States law or to research-related information which is typically unregulated or unrestricted through the peer review and approval processes. The objective of an information security program is to protect information from unauthorized release and ensure that the appropriate level of confidentiality is preserved. Facilities should develop policies that govern the identification, marking and han dling of sensitive information. The information security program should be tailored to meet the needs of the business environment, support the mission of the organization, and mitigate the identified threats. It is critical that access to sensitive informa tion be controlled. Policies for properly identifying and securing sensitive information including electronic files and removable electronic media (e.g., CDs, computer drives) should be developed. Transport of Biological Agents Material transport policies should include accountability measures for the movement of materials within an institution (e.g., between laboratories, during shipping and receiving activities) and outside of the facility (e.g., between institutions or locations). Transport policies sh ould address the need for appropriate documentation and material accountability and control procedures for pathogens in transit between locations. Transport security measures should be instituted to ensure that appropriate authorizations have been received and that adequate communication between facilities has occurred before, during, and after transport of pathogens or other potentially hazardous biological materials. Personnel should be adequately trained and familiar with regulatory and institutional pro cedures for proper containment, packaging, labeling, documentation and transport of biological materials. Accident, Injury and Incident Response Plans Laboratory security policies should consider situations that may require emergency responders or public safety personnel to enter the facility in response to an accident, injury or other safety issue or security threat. The preservation of human life, the safety and health of laboratory employees and the surrounding community must take precedence in an emergency over biosecurity concerns. Facilities are encouraged to coordinate with medical, fire, police and other emergency officials when preparing emergency and security breach response plans. Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs) should be developed that min imize the potential exposure of responding personnel to potentially hazardous biological materials. Laboratory emergency response plans should be integrated with relevant facility -wide or site -specific security plans. 52 These plans should also consider such adverse events as bomb threats, natural disasters and severe weather, power outages, and other facility emergencies that may introduce security threats. Reporting and Communication Communication is an important aspect of a biosecurity program. A \"chain of notification\" should be established in advance of an actual event. This communication chain should include laboratory and program officials, institution management, and any relevant regulatory or public authorities. The roles and responsibilities of all involved officials and programs should be clearly defined. Policies should address the reporting and investigation of potential security breaches (e.g., missing biological agents, unusual or threatening phone calls, unauthorized personnel in restricted areas). Training and Practice Drills Biosecurity training is essential for the successful implementation of a biosecurity program. Program management should establish training programs that inform and educate individuals regarding their responsibilities within the laboratory and the instituti on. Practice drills should address a variety of scenarios such as loss or theft of materials, emergency response to accidents and injuries, incident reporting, and identification of and response to security breaches. These scenarios may be incorporated int o existing emergency response drills such as fire drills or building evacuation drills associated with bomb threats. Incorporating biosecurity measures into existing procedures and response plans provides efficient use of resources saves time and can minim ize confusion during emergencies. Security Updates and Re -evaluations The biosecurity risk assessment and program should be reviewed and updated routinely and following any biosecurity -related incident. Reevaluation is a necessary and on- going process in the dynamic environments of today's biomedical and research laboratories. Biosecurity program managers should develop and conduct biosecurity program audits and implement corrective actions as needed. Audit results and corrective actions should be documented. The appropriate program officials should maintain records. Select Agents Most clinical laboratories will rarely, if ever, have a select agent tested in their lab. Those who do will only handle a select agent temporarily while testing a patient samp le. If you're unable rule out the possibility that the sample may be a select agent and must refer an isolate to your LRN reference laboratory for confirmation, then during the interim period you must take the necessary biosecurity precautions while in pos session of that sample. Confirmation of a select agent will require that you work with your LRN reference laboratory to properly transfer or destroy the sample and file the proper documentation with the CDC. If your laboratory purposely possesses, uses or transfers select agents, it must register with the Select Agent program and comply with all biosecurity requirements of the National Select Agent Program.

One common use of chain- of-custody in a clinical laboratory centers on sample collection for drug screening. This usually requires the completi on of a form which is submitted in a sealed package along with the sample for testing. Beyond this use, most clinical laboratorians are not involved with the concepts of providing a chain- of- custody. It's important for clinical laboratories to be familiar with the concepts of this process, but it's not necessary for them to have special chain -of-custody forms. Any sample submitted to a clinical laboratory has the potential of being a bioterrorism agent; however, it's not practical to start a chain -of-custod y form for each specimen. The need for chain- of-custody documentation will be determined after a confirmed identification of the agent, which may be several days after collection. Clinical laboratories have always had strict practices to accurately document their actions. These practices complement the main concepts of chain- of-custody which are to provide an accurate accounting of how evidence was acquired, maintained, transported and examined including by whom, when, where, and for what purpose. In the event that a potential bioterro rism agent or a suspect s elect a gent is identified in a clinical laboratory, the first step is to contact the local LRN Reference Laboratory. Once the LRN Reference Laboratory has possession, they may initiate their own internal chain -of-custody. The LRN Reference Laboratory will then complete confirmation testing on the suspect sample. Representatives from the LRN Reference Laboratory will provide specific guidance regarding chain- of-custody documentation based on the severi ty of the event. They will be able to assist the clinical laboratory to retrospectively fill in the time line from sample collection to the transfer of custody to the LRN Reference Laboratory. Examples of what a clinical laboratory may be asked to provide are: Copies of the initial order written by the attending physician. Copies of laboratory requisitions. Print out from the laboratory information management system (LIMS). Copies of work cards. Copies of laboratory reports. This list is not all inclusive . There are other pieces of information that may be necessary to complete the chain from collection to transfer. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 55 The chance of a clinical laboratory having to provide documentation for a chain -of-custody is very rare. Clinical laboratories are encouraged NOT to write chain -of-custody policies. There is no law, code, regulation, or other legal formula which gives specific guidance regarding the creation or use of chain- of-custody in a clinical laboratory setting. Records like those listed in this document will support a person's testimony on how evidence was handled. If there is a written chain- of-custody plan then any non -compliance with the internal written plan would challenge the integrity of the evidence. Contacting the local LRN reference laboratory to seek specific guidance is the best practice a clinical laboratory could follow to start the first link in a chain- of- custody. 56 REGULATIONS THAT IMP ACT CLINICAL LABORAT ORIES SELECT AGENT REGULAT IONS The possession, use and transfer of select agents and toxins are regulated by the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Clinical and diagnostic laboratories that possess, use, or transfer a select agent or toxin in a diagnostic specimen that is presented for diagnosis or verification will be exempt from the regulations as long as the following conditions are met: (42 CFR 73.5 and 73.6) 1. Within 7 calendar days after confirmation , the select agent or toxi n must be transferred in accordance with \u00a7 73.16 or destroyed on -site by a recognized sterilization or inactivation process. For further information, see Decontamination of Select Agents Isolated in the Clinical Laboratory in the appendix. 2. The select agent or toxin must be secured against theft, loss, or release during the period between identification and transfer or destruction. Any theft, loss, or release of such agent or toxin must be reported. 3. The identification of the select agent or toxin is reporte d to the CDC or APHIS (Your LRN reference laboratory will work with you to complete the APHIS/CDC Form 4: \"Report of the Identification of a Select Agent or Toxin \" a. APHIS/CDC Form 4 must be submitted wi thin 7 calendar days. b. A copy of APHIS/CDC Form 4 must be kept for 3 years. APHIS/CDC FORMS 1.

See the Decontamination of Select Agents Isolated in the Clinical Laboratory document for instructions. OSHA BLOODBORNE PATH OGENS REGULATIONS Clinical laboratory workers are routinely exposed to bloodborne pathogens that are present in human blood and can cause disease in humans. These pathogens include, but are not limited to, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The following are the OSHA regulatory standards for the implementation of a bloodborne pathogens exposure control program by laboratory manage ment for the safety of its employees. OSHA BLOODBORNE PATH OGENS STANDARD o As mandated by the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act, OSHA revised the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard (29 CFR 1910.1030) , effective April 18, 2001. Definitions for bloodborne patho gens, other potentially infectious materials (OPIM), and occupational exposure are found in 29 CFR 1910.1030(b). o Healthcare entities must identify employees who have occupational exposure to blood or OPIM, establish, and implement a written Exposure Contro l Plan (ECP) that is designed to eliminate or minimize employee exposures. 29 CFR 1910.1030(c)(1) POST- EXPOSURE FOLLOW -UP o Employer should ensure that a post -exposure evaluation and follow -up is in place to handle needlestick and sharps injuries. o Employer s hould provide a confidential medical evaluation and follow -up to the exposed employee, immediately following the report of an exposure incident (29 CFR 1910.1030(f)(3)) . It is recommended that the follow -up include identifying injury patterns and accident analysis to determine if additional training, procedures, or safer needle devices should be used to prevent future accidents. RECORDKEEPING FOR BL OODBORNE PATHOGENS 58 o Employers should establish and maintain both medical and training records (29 CFR 1910.1030(h)(1) and 29 CFR 1910.1020). o If an exposure occurs, the employer should add documentation to the medical record to include incident description, test results, follow up instructions and written evaluation from the health care professional. NEEDLESTICK AND OTHER SHARPS INJURIE S o Utilize safer needle devices and needleless devices to decrease needlestick or other sharps exposures. o Exercise proper handling and disposal of needles and other sharps according to the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard can help prevent needlestick injuries. o Implement engineering and work practice controls to help prevent exposures UNIVERSAL PRECAUTION S o Employers should define and implement universal precautions.

The Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) are federal regulations (Standards and Certification: Laboratory Requirements (42 CFR 493) ) that govern laboratory testing. Government authority has been given to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Servi ces (CMS) to administer the CLIA program. The CLIA 1988 amendments ensure the quality of laboratory performance and require clinical laboratories to be certified or accredited by CLIA or one of seven approved private, non- profit accrediting agencies appro ved by CMS. Adherence to the CLIA federal regulations must be established prior to accepting human samples for diagnostic testing. Laboratories can obtain multiple types of CLIA certificates, based on the type of diagnostic tests performed. Although all cl inical laboratories must be properly certified to receive Medicare or Medicaid payments, CLIA has no direct Medicare or Medicaid program responsibilities. Three federal agencies are responsible for CLIA: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Center for M edicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Center for Disease Control (CDC). Each agency has a unique role in assuring quality laboratory testing. FDA Categorizes tests based on complexity Reviews requests for Waiver by Application Develops rules/guidance for CLIA complexity categorization CMS Issues laboratory certificates Collects user fees Conducts inspections and enforces regulatory compliance Approves private accreditation o rganizations for performing inspections, and approves state exemptions Monitors laboratory performance on Proficiency Testing (PT) and approves PT programs Publishes CLIA rules and regulations CDC Provides analysis, research, and technical assistance Develops technical standards and laboratory practice guidelines, including standards and guidelines for cytology Conducts laboratory q uality improvement studies Monitors proficiency testing practices Develops and distributes professional information and educational resources Manages the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Advisory Committee (CLIAC) For more information: http://www.cms.gov/Regulations- and -Guidance/Legislation/CLIA/index.html .

Exposure to SEB as a result of a bioterrorist event may in clude exposure to both the organism S. aureus and the enterotoxin or exposure to the enterotoxin only. Specimens may be tested for both the presence of enterotoxin and the bacterium. Ship Immediately at 2-8\u00b0 C Foods should be left in their original contain ers if possible or placed in sterile unbreakable containers. Place containers individually in leakproof containers (i.e., sealed plastic bags) to prevent cross -contamination during shipment. Empty containers with remnants of suspected contaminated foods ca n be examined. Environmental samples such as paper, powder, swabs, wipes, water, and soil can be sent to your local LRN Reference Laboratory for SEB testing. Serum is the preferred specimen for testing for inhalation SEB intoxication by detecting antibodies to SEB. Use a red - top or serum separator -type (SST) tube to obtain serum. Samples should be obtained as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms to detect the toxin. Serum should also be collected 7 to 14 days after onset of illness to comp are acute - and convalescent - phase antibody titers. Do not send whole blood, since hemolysis during transit will compromise the quality of the specimen. Ship Immediately at 2-8\u00b0 C The tube must be free of anticoagulants. Approximately 10 m L of blood shoul d be drawn to provide 5 mL of serum. Nasal swab: Rub dry, sterile swab (Dacron or rayon) on the mucosa of the anterior nares. Place in protective transport tube. Ship Immediately at 2-8\u00b0 C Collect a nasal swab within 24 h of exposure Induced Respirat ory Sections: Sputum induced by instilling 10 to 25 m L of sterile saline into the nasal passages should be collected into a sterile screw -top container.

Nonclinical specimens should be directed to the designated LRN Reference Laboratory. All patient specimens can be handled using BSL -2 practices. BSL-3 precautions , wearing gloves and gown and working in a certified Class II biological safety cabinet (BSC) are recommended when performing activities having a high potential for aerosol production. Subcultures should be performed in a BSC and plates should be taped/shr ink sealed, and incubated in 5 - 10% CO2. All additional testing should be performed only in the BSC while wearing gloves to prevent acquiring infection through the skin. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section contained within this gu idance manual, the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ ) and Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Anima l Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6101a1.htm ) for more information. DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracis) is a zoonotic organism that can result in four types of infection, depending on the pathogen's point of entry into the body \u2014inhalation, cutaneous, gastrointestinal, and injection. Inhalation of anthrax spores causes the most deadly form of anthr ax. If left untreated, 85 to 90% of patients will not survive. Therefore, cultures should not be manipulated on an open bench; BSL -3 protocols are recommended when dealing with potential of aerosol exposure in order to avoid potential laboratory acquired infections (LAI). B. anthracis (anthrax) can contaminate soil, plants, and water. Animals can be infected when they breathe or ingest spores. Veterinary public health has kept infection rates low in the United States, although sporadic outbreaks do occu r in grazing animals. Domestic and livestock animals should be vaccinated annually if they live in an area where animals have been infected. Humans can become infected when anthrax spores enter the body through breathing, eating or drinking anthrax bacteria or spores, or through cuts or scrapes in the skin. Anthrax is not spread from person to person. Injection anthrax has not been reported in the United States. Although infection rates in the United States are low, certain activities can put people at higher risk. These include working with infected animals or animal products or eating raw or undercooked meat from infected SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS: As soon as B. anthracis is suspected in the laboratory, perform ALL further work within a Class II Biological Safety Cabine t (BSC) using BSL -3 practices. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 76 animals. Laboratorians with high exposure to anthrax cultures are also at increased risk (see safety practices). Once inside the b ody, active spores can multiply and produce toxins, resulting in severe illness or death. A vaccine, Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (AVA), is available that protects against cutaneous and inhalational anthrax. This vaccine is recommended for groups at high risk of infection. Antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin and doxycycline can be used to prevent anthrax in those who have been exposed but not yet developed symptoms. SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE Symptoms of anthrax, as well as the time before they manifest, vary dependi ng on how the bacterium enters the body. It is important to seek treatment as soon as possible if you suspect anthrax infection . ANTHRAX LESION Cutaneous anthrax symptoms include blisters or bumps that may itch followed by a painless skin ulcer (eschar) with a black center most often on the face, neck, arms, or hands. Inhalational and gastrointestinal anthrax have common symptoms such as fever and chills, headache, and nausea and vomiting. Inhalational anthrax can also cause chest discomfort and extreme tiredness, while gastrointestinal anthrax may also result in fainting and swelling of the abdomen. 77 ACCEPTABLE SAMPLE TY PES (http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines ) A. Collection and Transport of Clinical Specimens for Laboratory Rule- Out Testing* Cutaneous Vesicular (early) stage Unroof vesicle and fluid or collect with two sterile swabs (dacron) Eschar (late) stage Insert swab (dacron) beneath the edge of the eschar, rotate swab or obtain an aspirate. Transport specimens at room temperature. Gastrointestinal Stool (> 5 grams...pecan size), collect and transport in a leak proof sealed container Collect blood (late stage of infection) directly into an appropriate blood culture bottle (aerobic and anaerobic) Transport specimens and bottles at room temperature Inhalational Sputum Blood: collect directly into an appropriate blood culture bottle (aerobic and anaerobic) Cerebral Spinal Fluid only if signs of meningitis occur Transport specimens and bottles at room temperature Postmortem Tissue Tissue pieces should be collected and kept moist Transport in sterile container at room temperature within 1 hour of collection 78 MICROSCOPY CHARACTER ISTICS GRAM STAIN Large Gram positive rods. Spores may be found in cultures grown in 5% CO 2 but are not usually in clinical samples. COLONY MORPHOLOGY AN D GROWTH CHARACTERIS TICS Colonies are 2 -5 mm on BAP at 18- 24h; however, growth can be observed as early as 4 -8h. Non -pigmented, non- hemolytic colonies are round with irregular edges, flat or slightly convex with ground glass appearance. There are often \"comma -shaped\" projections from the edge of the colony, producing the \"Medusa head\" shape. Colonies have a tenacious consistency that when teased with a loop, the growth will stand up like beaten egg whites. B. anthracis will NOT grow on MAC or eosin methylene blue agar (EMB) plates . Gram anthracis Gram positive, endospore -forming anthracis 79 Colonies morphology 24 HOURS ON on BAP showing \"Tenacious\" BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE AND KEY ORGA automated systems, including Mass Spectrometry (MALDI -TOF ) technology may result in exposure to dangerous pathogens, and could result in erroneous identification, e.g., Bacillus anthracis misidentifie d as B. cereus ; Yersinia pestis misidentified as Y. pseudotuberculosis MALDI -TOF IDENTIFICATION If your laboratory us es mass spectrometry (MALDI -TOF ) for bacterial identification, and if the manufacturer provides your facility with an alternate tube extraction method, it is recommended that the resulting extract be filtered using a 0.2 \u00b5m (or less) filter. This additional step is recommended to reduce the chance of laboratory contamination with viable bacteria and spores. CATALASE TEST Warning! For sa fety purposes, it is recommended that this test be performed in a BSC, covered petri dish or tube to ensure the containment of aerosols that are produced when the test organism generates a positive result (production of bubbles). B. anthracis is catalase positive (+). MOTILITY TEST Performing a motility (wet mount) test is potentially hazardous due to the potential for the creation of an aerosol. Perform a tube motility. These tests must be performed in a BSC. B. anthracis is a nonmotile organism. 81 POSSIBLE MISIDENTIFICATIONS F OR B. anthracis IN THE LAB: Possible Misidentifications for B. anthracis Agent Indicator Test Result B. megaterium Motility Positive Motility Positive B. cereus Hemolytic B. thuringiensis Hemolytic and not a human pathogen LABORATORY TESTING I NFORMATION Refer to the ASM Sentinel Level Clinical Laboratory Protocols for more detailed information: http://www.asm.org/inde x.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines .

REPORTING AND NOTIFI CATION TO STATE OR L OCAL PUBLIC HEALTH Suspect cases shoul d be immediately reported to the local health department for investigation. Prior to submitting specimens for testing, your LRN Reference Laboratory must be contacted for specimen submission guidance and to provide test notification. For confirmed cases, clinical laboratories must always refer to their State / Local and Federal disease notification and reporting requirements. See your state specific contact information in the State Information and the following link for Federal guidelines. http://www.selectagents.gov/ SHIPPING AND TRANSFE RS Upon notification to the local health department epidemiology program and coordination with your local Public Health LRN Reference Laboratory of a suspected B. anthracis , laboratories should be prepared to properly package and ship the sample(s). If a culture is being submitted for LRN Rule- Out Testing, the shipment should be classified, handled, packaged and transported as \"Suspected Category A.\" Please note that an orga nism with a confirmed select agent identification will require a CDC/APHIS Form 2 for transfer. See the Packaging and Shipping Section contained within this guidance manual for additional information about sample classification and shipping procedures. DESTRUCTION AND DECO NTAMINATION The Public Health Agency of Canada has created Pathogen Safety Data Sheets for numerous human pathogens. These technical documents are intended to describe the hazardous properties of listed organisms and recommendations for work involving these agents in a laboratory setting. A complete list of the organisms as well as other safety related information is available here: http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/lab- bio/res/psds- ftss/index -eng.php . If the identification is confirmed then you must either transfer or destroy all remaining materials, isolates, patient samples, etc. within 7 days. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regu lations section for directions on how to destroy, secure, or transfer the agent . (See DecontaminationSelectAgents_JobAid_10_06_2015_Final Job Aid ) Work with your LRN Reference Laboratory on how to fill out the required paperwork.

REFERENCES CDC Anthrax http://w Guidelines: suis) (BRUCELLOSIS ) WARNING: If a characteristic Gram stain showing tiny, Gram negative coccobacillus is seen along with consistent growth on blood agar oxidase -positive, catalase -positive, urease -positive, nonmotile colonies is not a recommended sentinel laboratory test for Brucella) with no growth on MacConkey agar (MAC) , it is likely to be a Brucella species. Further identification and manipulations should not be attempted with commercial automated or kit identification systems, because of the potential danger of aerosol production due to preparing high concentrations of organisms. In addition, the identification by these systems can produce false results due to biochemically related organisms in the database, or incomplete databases. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFE LABORATORY PRAC TICES Do not process non -clinical (environmenta l or animal speci mens) in sentinel laboratories. Non -clinical specimens, such as environmental samples should be directed to the designated state or local LRN Reference Laboratory. Brucella is a highly infectious pathogen. Biosafety Level 2 (BSL- 2) practices should be observed for activities involving clinical materials of human or animal origin. If Brucella is suspected, or known to be contained within a sample, BSL -3 practices, precautions and containment should be observed for all handling and manipulations of cultures. If a BSL -3 laboratory is not available, BSL -3 practices and precautions should be observed and followed while operating at BSL -2. If Brucella is suspected or the Gram stain shows a tiny, gram negative cocco bacillus, avoid aerosol generating procedures and perform all subcultures in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC). All suspected patient specimens should be handled while wearing gloves and gowns and working in a BSC. Plates should be taped shut, an d all further testing should be performed only in the BSC, using BSL -3 practices. Laboratories should conduct a risk assessment for the use of any respiratory protection practices. Brucellosis is the most commonly reported laboratory -associated bacteria l infection. A number of factors contribute to the risk of an accidental Brucella laboratory exposure, including: Lack of experience working with the organism Unknown or unidentified samples that arrive for analysis Work performed on a Brucella isolate on an open bench, not under containment such as within a Class II BSC, or in BSL -3 conditions. SAFETY CONSIDERATION S: As soon as Brucella is suspected in the laboratory, perform ALL further work within containment such as a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) and follow BSL -3 practices. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 86 The primary infection hazards are exposure to aerosols, direct skin contact with cultures or other infectious specimens or material, ingestion, accidental inoculati on, or sprays into the mucous membranes such as eyes, nose or mouth. Certain characteristics of the bacterium, such as its low infectious dose and ease of aerosolization also contribute to the risk of infection by the organism in a laboratory setting. Spe cific risks include, but are not limited to the following laboratory -related activities: Pipetting Centrifuging Grinding Blending Shaking Mixing Sonicating Opening containers of infectious materials outside of containment such as a BSC Preparing smears, performing heat fixing, staining slides Performing a catalase test on an open bench Performing wet mount motility test Those at risk of infection include those who are: Practicing a specifically implicated procedure (such as above) Manipulating Brucella isolates on an open bench without the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and recommended practices in the Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories Present in a laboratory during a Brucella aerosol -generating event, such as standing or sitting within five feet of any manipulation of a Brucella isolate on an open bench To help minimize these risks, laboratory workers should follow these recommended risk mitigation steps in addition to wearing appropriate PPE: Use primary barriers such as sealed safety centrifuge cups, personal protective equipment, and Class II or higher Biological Safety Cabinets for procedures with a high likelihood of producing droplet splashes or aerosols. Use secondary barriers such as restricting access to the laboratory when work is being performed and maintain the integrity of the laboratory's air handling system by keeping external doors and windows closed. Perfor m all procedures on unidentified isolates carefully to minimize the creation of splashes or aerosols. Prohibit sniffing of opened culture plates to assist in the identification of isolates. Manipulate isolates of small gram -negative or gram -variable cocco bacilli /rods within a BSC. 87 Do not perform a motility test for the presumptive identification of Brucella. This test is not a recommended sentinel lab procedure because Brucella does not grow in semi -solid media and wet mount tests increase the risk of an exposure. Additional information for assessing laboratory risk levels and potential exposures can be found here: http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/laboratories/risk -level.html . Labor atory workers should observe and follow the ASM Sentinel Laboratory Guidelines and Protocols, and the CDC recommendations for laboratory containment methods and microbial procedures to ensure compliance with safe laboratory practices in accordance with the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition . The CDC also provides additional laboratory guidance specifically for work with Brucella species, which can be f ound here: http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/laboratories/safety.html . For additional information about risk assessments and general laboratory safety, please refer to those sections w ithin this guidance manual. DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Although brucellosis can be found worldwide, it is especially found in countries that do not have effective public health and domestic animal health programs. The occurrence of brucellosis often depends on the extent of brucellosis in the area's animal population. Brucellosis is predominantly an occupational disease for those who work with infected animals or their tissues. According to the CDC Brucella exposure website , areas currently listed as high risk are: The Mediterranean Basin (Portugal, Spain, Southern France, Italy, Greece, Turkey, North Africa) Mexico, South and Central America Eastern Europe Asia Africa The Caribbean The Middle East Brucellosis may also be referred to as Undulant fever, Malta fever, Mediterranean fever, Rock of Gibraltar fever, and Bang's disease. The known host range is humans, cattle, swine, goats, sheep, deer, caribou, elk, dogs, and coyotes. Table 1 below lists the known reservoirs. The exact infectious dose is unknown, however the infectious dose for these organisms is very low if acquired via the inhalation route, which makes them a potentially effective bioterrorism agent and als o makes them a significant infection hazard in the clinical microbiology laboratory. The modes of transmission for brucellosis are through ingestion, inhalation, and direct contact via skin abrasions and mucous membranes. People can become infected when e xposed to factors such as contact with infected tissues, blood, urine, vaginal discharge, aborted fetuses; ingestion of raw milk or 88 cheese from infected animals; contact in abattoirs; laboratory -acquired (generally through aerosolization). 1. Ingestion: The most common way to be infected with Brucella is by eating, drinking or consuming unpasteurized/raw dairy products. When sheep, goats, cows, or camels are infected, their milk becomes contaminated with the bacteria. If the milk from infected animals is not pasteurized, the infection will be transmitted to people who consume the milk and/or cheese product. Unpasteurized cheeses (sometimes called \"village cheeses\") may represent a particular risk for tourists. Developing countries often do not have safeguards that can help prevent or monitor possible outbreaks, such as pasteurization laws, animal control/slaughter regulations, and brucellosis surveillance programs. For additional information about identified risk areas, please visit: http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/exposure/areas.html . 2. Inhalation: Breathing in the bacteria that causes brucellosis may also lead to infection. This risk is generally greater for people in laboratories that work with the bacteria. In addition, slaughterhouses and meat -packing employees have also been known to be exposed to the bacteria and ultimately become infected. 3. Cutaneous and Mucous Membrane: Bacteria can also enter the body through wounds in the skin or mucous membranes after contact with infected animals. This poses a problem for workers who have close contact with animals or animal excretions such as newborn animals, fetuses, and excretions that may result from birth. Such workers may include slaughterhouse workers, meat -packing plant employees, and veterinarians. Anyone who is exposed to the bacteria that c ause brucellosis is at risk for infection. Some people, based on certain circumstances, may face an increased risk. People in certain occupations or settings may face increased exposure to the bacteria that cause brucellosis. These occupations can include: Slaughterhouse workers Meat -packing employees Veterinarians Laboratory workers Infections are seen in essentially two patient populations. The first is individuals who work with unvaccinated and infected animals. This patient population includes farmers, veterinarians, and slaughterhouse workers. B. abortus (cattle) and B. suis (pigs) are the agents most likely to cause infections within this group of individuals. Brucellosis is secondarily seen in individuals who ingest unpasteurized dairy products conta minated with Brucella . This is most likely to occur in individuals who travel to or migrate from rural areas of Latin American and the Middle East, or have come into contact with unpasteurized materials from these sources. The disease can be endemic in dai ry animals, particularly in goats and camels. B. melitensis is the most common agent seen in this patient population. 89 The dangers of acquiring brucellosis among hunters represent another risk factor, and they can acquire the disease by direct contact with , or aerosolization from infected animal tissues. When they are in contact with infected animals, exposure to the bacteria may occur through skin wounds, accidentally ingesting undercooked meat, inhaling the bacteria while dressing their game. Commonly infected animals include bison, elk, caribou, moose and wild hogs (feral swine). Laboratory workers are also a group of people who can acquire the infection from direct exposure to cultures of the organism or other contaminated material in the laboratory. Person to person transmission of brucellosis is extremely rare. Sexual transmission has been rarely reported. While uncommon, transmission may also occur via tissue transplantation or blood transfusions. While rare, human- to-human transmission from lactating mothers to their breastfed infants has been reported. Prompt diagnosis and treatment of brucellosis during pregnancy can be lifesaving for the fetus. For additional transmission information, please visit: http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/transmission/index.html BRUCELLA SPECIES Brucella abortus* The principal host for Brucella abortus is cattle (the genus for cattle is Bos). In the U.S, eradication of B. abortus from cattle is nearl y complete, but the disease still occurs in some wild bison and elk herds in the western U.S. B. abortus RB51 and S19 are vaccine strains of this bacterium developed specifically for immunization of cattle against brucellosis to allow serological differen tiation between naturally infected and vaccinated animals. Accidental human exposure to RB51, though uncommon, has resulted in development of symptoms consistent with naturally occurring brucellosis. In a laboratory setting, the risk for accidental exposur e to RB51 is highest for procedures or manipulations that occur outside the Class II BSC and that have the potential for creating aerosols or splashes. Exposures have included needle sticks, eye and wound splashes, and contact with infected material. Serol ogical monitoring is available for S19 exposures. It is recommended that laboratories working with the B. abortus vaccine strains RB51 or S19 should perform all manipulations in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet, utilizing BSL-3 practices as described i n Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition . Brucella canis The principal host for Brucella canis is dogs (the genus for dogs is Canis ). It can also cause infection in humans. Typically, there is a low risk of infection for pet owners. Individuals who are in close contact with dogs, such as breeders, or veterinary staff who assist with birthing however are at an increased risk of becoming infected since they may be exposed to blood, tissues and fluids associated with the birthing process. Currently, there are no serological tests to detect antibodies to B. canis. Therefore, 90 more attention should be given to symptom monitoring. Pet owners who feel that they m ay have been exposed should contact their local or state health departments for guidance. Brucella ceti and B. pinnipediae B. ceti and B. pinnipediae are relatively recent Brucella species to be discovered in marine mammals, and have been associated with a few human cases diagnosed of neurobrucellosis. Brucella melitensis * The principal hosts for B. melitensis are goats and sheep (the genus for goats is Capra and Ovis for sheep) and also can be camel (genus Camelus ). B. melitensis is considered to be eradicated in the U.S. since the early 1970s. The sporadic cases in humans in the U.S. occur related to consumption of unpasteurized dairy products from countries where the disease is present. B. melitensis is the most prevalent species worldwide and is considered to be the most pathogenic or virulent and causes the most severe and acute cases of brucellosis. The vaccine strain B. melitensis Rev-1 for sheep and goats can al so cause infection in humans. Veterinarians and other medical staff performing immunizations in cattle should be aware of the risks and what to do when an exposure occurs. Rev -1 exposures should follow the same assessment guidance as for B. abortus RB51. S erological monitoring is available for Rev -1 exposures. It is recommended that laboratories working with the B. melitensis Rev-1 vaccine strains should perform all manipulations in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet, utilizing BSL -3 practices as describe d in Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) 5th Edition . ovis and B. neotomae B. ovis and B. neotomae are not known to be pathogenic for humans. Brucella suis* The principal host for B. suis is swine (the genus for pigs is Sus). Since B. suis is normally found in pigs, wild hog (feral swine) hunters are at risk of becoming infected when they field dress infected pigs. In 1954, Brucella suis became the firs t biological agent to be weaponized by the United States in the days of its offensive biological warfare program. NOTE : *Three species of Brucella suis are designated as Select Agents and have been identified as having the potential to be developed as bioterrorism agents due to their ability to undergo aerosolization. Additional information about Select Agents may be found here: www.selectagents.gov . Brucellosis is a zoonotic infection with no identified vectors and with four species being recognized as reservoirs and causing infection in humans: Brucella abortus (cattle), Brucella melitensis (goats, sheep, and camels), Brucella suis (pigs), and Brucella canis (dogs). See table 1 below for additional host range and reservoirs. 91 TABLE 1: BRUCELLA HOST ANIMAL RANGE Host Animals for Brucella Species Species Main Animal Host(s) B. abortus Cattle http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/veterinarians/cattle.html canis Dogs ceti Cetaceans (dolphins, porpoises, whales) B. melitensis Goats, sheep, camels B. microti Common vole B. neotomae Wood rats B. ovis Sheep, goats B. pinnipediae Pinnipeds (seals, sea lions, walruses) B. suis Pigs SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS / CLINICAL PRESENTATION: The incubation period for brucellosis is highly variable. Symptoms of brucellosis may occur anytime from 5 days to 6 months after initial exposure. Typically the incubation range is 2 to 10 weeks. Symptoms may also disappear for w eeks or months only to return at a later date. It has a mortality of 5% in untreated individuals, usually from endocarditis. Brucella can cause both acute and chronic infections. The symptoms of brucellosis are non- specific and systemic. A brucellosis ill ness is characterized by acute or insidious onset of intermittent fever and one or more of the following: night sweats, arthralgia, headache, fatigue, anorexia, myalgia, weakness, malaise, back pain, weight loss, arthritis/spondylitis, meningitis, or focal organ involvement (endocarditis, orchitis/epididymitis, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly). Some signs and symptoms may persist for longer periods of time. Others may never go away or reoccur. These can include recurrent fever, arthritis, swelling of the testicl es and scrotum area, swelling of the heart (endocarditis), neurologic symptoms (in up to 5% of all cases), chronic fatigue, depression, and swelling of the liver and/or spleen. Gastrointestinal symptoms which are present in 50% of patients include abdomin al pain, constipation, diarrhea, and vomiting. The chronic form of the disease can mimic miliary tuberculosis. Chronic untreated brucellosis can lead to abscesses in the liver, spleen, heart valves, brain, or bone; osteoarticular complications; and, in rare cases, death. For additional information about signs and symptoms, please visit: http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/symptoms/index.html . 92 DIAGNOSING BRUCELLOS IS Brucellosis is often included in the differential diagnosis of fevers of unknown origin. The diagnosis of human brucellosis cannot be made solely on clinical symptoms since there are varying clinical manifestations and initial symptoms are non -specific. Th e CDC provides information regarding brucellosis symptoms here: http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/symptoms/index.html and case definitions including initial and definitive diagnosis here: http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/conditions/brucellosis/case -definition/2010/ . The CDC Brucellosis http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/pdf/case -report -form.pdf MICROSCOPY CHARACTER ISTICS Warning: Do not attempt to identify tiny Gram negative rods that do not grow on MAC agar using a commercial identification system because of their lack of accuracy and danger of aerosols. GRAM STAIN Brucella species are small, faintly staining, Gram negative coccobacilli, or appearing as tiny rods. The Gram stain of Brucella is unique in that the organisms are very small, stain poorly or faintly, and tend not to cluster. Brucella species will be 0.4 by 0.8 m. Note : Brucella species Gram stains should not to be confused with poorly staining Gram positive cocci, because of their tiny size. Brucella species may also retain Crystal Violet, which can make them appear Gram positive. 93 DIAGRAM 1, Brucella spp. GRAM STAIN COLONY MORPHOLOGY AN D GROWTH CHARACTERIS TICS Brucella species will grow on blood agar (BAP) and chocolate agar (CHOC), -spore forming, nonmotile, coccobacillus. Culture media should be incubated in 5 to10% CO 2 to enhance growth. Brucella colonies will appear as small to pinpoint, raised, convex white colonies with an entire edge and a shiny surface. The colonies will typically show a \"dust -like\" growth after overnight incubation (e.g., 18 - 24 hours). A minimum of 48 hours is necessary to get sufficient growth for further identification. Colonies are more easily visible a s white, non- pigmented, non- hemolytic colonies (on BAP), and non- mucoid at 48 hours, which further differentiates them from other genera. Colonies are odorless or described as having a non- distinct odor, however it is strongly recommended to NOT sniff culture plates. Brucella colonies will be 0.5 to 1.0 mm in diameter after 48 hours of incubation. Brucella species will grow slowly in aerobic blood culture bottles (e.g., after 2 -4 days) and only appearing to grow on subculture after 48 hours of incubation on CHOC and BAP. To identify Brucella to the genus level some biochemical testing is needed, however, au tomated systems and manual multi -test kit identifications have no place in the identification of the organism, due to its minimal reactivity, creation of aerosols in performance of the testing, the danger of misidentification due to its close relation to o ther organisms that are positive for only a few tests, and the easy, rapid method to presumptively identify the organism without use of system identifications. Clinically, rapid identification to the genus level is adequate to initiate therapy, and the typ e of Brucella species involved does not alter the therapy. Before the development of molecular techniques, species identification was difficult and, in most cases, was not performed . Species were usually differentiated by their natural host reservoir. NOTE : Confirmatory identification of Brucella species is made by an LRN Reference Laboratory. 94 BAP AGAR Colonies on BAP have no distinguishing features. They will appear as white, non-pigmented and non- hemolytic. 24 Hours on BAP 48 Hour s on BAP 72 Hour s on BAP CHOC AGAR Chocolate agar is used to support the growth of fastidious organisms. 24 Hour s on CHOC 48 Hour s on CHOC 72 Hour s on CHOC 95 MACCONKEY (MAC) AGAR NOTE : If a Gram ne gative rod is isolated in a s entinel laboratory and it does not grow on MacConkey agar, it should not be processed for identification by a multi -test kit or automated system. Brucella species typically does not grow on MAC and will not show the characteristic morphology of other gram negative rods on MAC within 48 hours. Pinpoint colonies have been infrequently observed on MAC after extended incubation times (7 days). Seeing small, gram negative organisms on the Gram stain with addition of the \"no growth\" observation on MAC will assist in the recognition and suspicion of Brucella species in the laboratory, and will aid in the differentiation to separate it from other gram - negative coccob acilli. 24 Hour s on MAC BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE AND KEY ORGANISM CHA RACTERISTICS WARNING: Using automated systems, including Mass Spectrometry (MALDI -TOF ) technology may result in exposure to dangerous pathogens, and could result in erroneous ident ification, e.g., Bacillus anthracis misidentified as B. cereus misidentified as Y. pseudotuberculosis . MALDI -TOF Identification us es mass spectrometry (MALDI -TOF ) for bacterial identification, and if the manufacturer provides your facility with an alternate tube extraction method, it is recommended that the resulting extract be filtered using a 0.2 \u00b5m (or less) filter. This additional step is recommended to reduce the chance of laboratory contamination with viable bacteria and spores. Laboratorians should perform all quality control of media and reagents according to package inserts, most recent CLSI document M22, and CLIA standards, using positive and negative con trols. Do not use Brucella spp. as a control organism, due to its infectious nature. 96 Refer to the ASM Sentinel Laboratory Biochemical Recommendations and Test Procedures for additional information: http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines . Sentinel Laboratories should perform the minimal amount of testing possible to presumptively identify Brucella. The recommended biochemical tests to for presumptive Brucella recognition include: CATALASE Warning! For safety purposes, it is recommended that this test be performed in a BSC, covered petri dish or tube to ensure the containment of aerosols that are produced when the test organism g enerates a positive result (production of bubbles). Brucella spp. are catalase positive (+). OXIDASE Brucella species will be oxidase positive. The o xidase test (0.5 tetramethyl -p-phenylenediamine) will have slightly variable results between species . B. abortus , B. melitensis , and B. suis are all oxidase positive (+) organisms and B. canis isolat es may be oxidase variable. 97 UREA The urease test can be conducted using Christensen's Urea agar (known as Christensen's method) or rapid urea disc s. Brucella species will be urease positive with varying times of positive reactions. Using the Christensen's tube test, urea hydrolysis can be observed in as early as 15 min incubation with B. suis and B. canis strains and within 1 day of incubation with mos t strains of B. abortus , and B. melitensis . Some B. melitensis strains can take even longer to be positive. It is recommended to incubate slants or broths aerobically at 35\u00b0C and observe for color change to intense magenta or pink at 15 min, 2 hour, and up to 72 hours. If the disc method is used, discs should also be incubated aerobically at 35\u00b0C and observe for color development at 15 min to 24 hours. SATELLITE (X/V FACTO RS) Brucella species can be confused with Haemophilus ; however Haemophilus will not grow on BAP and should be noted when determining differential identifications. When in doubt, di fferentiate between these two genera by performing a satellite test or an X and V factor test. Satellite test: Inoculate a blood agar plate, followed by cross -streaking or spotting with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923. After 24 -48 hours of incubation in 5 % CO 2, Haemophilus will demonstrate satellite growth around the S. aureus , while Brucella growth will be present on the BAP but is not limited to the area around the Staphylococcus . X and V Factor test: Follow the manufacturer's instructions for performing the test. Brucella growth will be present on the tryptic soy agar (TSA) but is not limited to the area around the X and V strips/discs. Haemophilus will demonstrate growth only around the X and V (combined) strip/disc. Haemophilus demonstrating growth only around the X and V (combined) disc. Brucella growing on the entire plate. Negative for X and V factors. 98 MOTILITY Although Brucella species are nonmotile, motility testing is not a recommended Sentinel Laboratory procedure. Brucella species do not grow in semi -solid test medium, and wet mount testing should not be performed due to the unnecessary risk the test presents. Motility testing does not provide useful presumptive identification information after the recommended Sentinel Laboratory procedures. DRUG RESISTANCE AND SUSCEPTIBILITY Brucella species are s usceptible to tetracyclines and streptomycin and cephalosporins. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of Brucella is neither needed nor appropriate for Sentinel Laboratories to perform. CLSI lists \"susceptible only\" breakpoints meaning that resistance rarely occurs and should be confirm ed in a reference laboratory equipped to test in a BSL-3 facility. 99 TABLE 2, POSSIBLE MISIDENTIFICATIONS FOR BRUCELLA Possible Misidentifications for Brucella Include: Organism Differential Test Haemophilus species (Also will appear as tiny coccobacillus in Gram stain) Haemophilus is catalase, urease and oxidase variable. Haemophilus will not grow on blood agar. Haemophilus will demonstrate satellite growth around S. aureus on blood agar, while Brucella growth is present on blood agar, and is not limited to the area around the Staphylococcus . Oligella ureolytica (Also will appear as tiny coccobacillus in Gram stain, usually found only in the urine) Both this organism and Brucella are catalase, urease and oxidase positive. O. ureolytica will show delayed motility. Note: Since Oligella has poor motility reaction, it would be better ruled -out with PDA which is included in some rapid urea tests. Motility is also not necessary since O. ureolytica is rarely found in the blood or sterile sites where Brucella is more likely to be found. O. ureolytica is a rare urinary pathogen. Psychrobacter phenylpyruvicus Both this urease and oxidase positive. Psychrobacter immobilis Both this organism and Brucella are catalase, urease and oxidase positive. P. immobilis will prefer to grow at 20\u00b0C. May have an odor of roses (however, do NOT sniff cultures). Bordetella bronchiseptica Both this organism and Brucella are catalase, urease and oxidase positive. and Brucella is nonmotile. Note: Motility testing is not needed to rule -out Bordetella since B. bronchiseptica grows on MAC, and is a rarely encountered organism in sterile sit e specimens. Paracoccus yeei Both this organism and Brucella are catalase, urease and oxidase positive. P. yeei will appear mucoid on BAP. Brucellosis can be diagnosed in a laboratory by finding bacteria in samples of blood, bone marrow or other bodily fluids. Sentinel Laboratories should always consult with their State or Local LRN Reference Laboratory for appropriate specimens for testing. 100 BACTERIAL ISOLATION Isolation of Brucella is often delayed compared to other bloodstream pathogens, with peak isolation occurring at 3 to 4 days compared to 6 to 36 h ours for most other pathogens. Although incubation time of 21 days with weekly or terminal blind subculture are advocated, careful studies in Brucella - endemic areas using automated culture systems suggest that a maximal incubation time of 10 days is sufficient for reliable recovery of this organism. Terminal subcultures at 7 days have been reported to increase yield. Brucella is most commonly isolated from blood cultures. It can also, however, be isolated from: Bone marrow Cerebrospinal fluid Wounds Purulent di scharge Joint fluid TABLE 3. ACCEPTABLE SAMPLE TY PES Collection and Transport of Clinical Specimens for Laboratory Rule- Out Testing Bone marrow or whole blood Considered the best specimen for culture but can be limited in chronic cases. Collect directly i nto an appropriate blood culture bottle. Aseptically inoculate liquid blood culture bottles with maximum amount of blood or body fluid per manufacturers' instructions. Incubate at 35\u00b0C. Transport bottles at room temperature as soon as possible to obtain th e diagnosis. A lternatively, follow the manufacturer's instructions for the lysis -centrifugation inoculate BAP, Incubate plates at 35\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5 to 10% CO 2. Joint or abdominal fluid Collect directly into an appropriate blood culture bottle. Transport bottles at room temperature as soon as possible to obtain the diagnosis. Spleen, liver abscesses Tissue pieces (at least the size of a pea) should be collected and kept moist. Transport in sterile container at room temperature within 1 hour of collection. May add 1 -2 drop of sterile saline to keep moist. Serum Collect at least 1 mL without anticoagulant for serologic diagnosis.1 Store at 4\u00b0C until testing is performed. Acute specimen is collected as soon as possible after onset of disease. Convalescent -phase should be collected >14 (14 - 21) days after the acute specimen. Tissues Inoculate BAP, CHOC and MAC and incubate at 35\u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5 to 10% CO 2 for 7 days (MAC need only be incubated for 3 days at 35\u00b0C in ambient air or 5 to 10% CO 2.) Humidity may be maintained by placing a pan of water in the bottom of the incubator or by wrapping the plates with gas permeable tape. 1 Tests include the titrated Rose Bengal test, microagglutination test, microtiter -adapted Coombs test, and immunocapture -agglutination test, all of which are more sensitive than EIA tests, which vary in their sensitivity and specificity. 101 All plates either from direct inoculation of specimens or from subculture of broths should be examined daily for growth of tiny colonies. When sending specimens to a LRN Reference Laboratory for confirmation, please be sure the laboratory is aware of your suspected diagnosis. SEROLOGY In addition to bacterial isolation, serological tests can be performed on some Brucella species. CDC utilizes a test called the Brucella microagglutination test (BMAT), a modified version of the serum (tube) agglutination test (SAT), that can detect antibodies species ( abortus , melitensis or suis) . There is no serological test available to detect antibodies to B. canis . LABORATORY TESTING I NFORMATION Refer to the ASM Sentinel Level Clinical Laboratory Protocols fo r more detailed information: http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines . For additional testing information, please contact your local LRN Referenc e Laboratory. RULE -OUT FLOWCHART The Sentinel Laboratory Rule- Out or Referral of Brucella is accomplished by utilizing the ASM Sentinel Laboratory Guidelines and Protocols, a summary flowchart below will aid in the process. If you see the following char acteristics: Tiny faintly staining Gram negative coccobacilli Slow growing (48 h ) suspicious colonies from agar plates and positive blood culture bottle s Growth on both BAP and CHOC of pinpoint colonies at 24 h , and more easily seen as white, non- hemolytic, non -mucoid colonies at 48 - 72 h (does not require X & V factor/satellite around S. aureus ) No growth on MAC/EMB Catalase (+), o xidase (+), and urease (+) NOTE: If a tiny Gram negative rod or coccobacillus is isolated in a Sentinel Laboratory and it does not grow on MacConkey agar, it should not be processed for identification by a multi- test kit or automated system. Then you cannot rule o ut Brucella spp. 102 BRUCELLA IDENTIFICATION FLOWC HART SAFETY: As soon as Brucella is suspected, perform ALL further work in a Class II BSC using BSL -3 practices. Major characteristics of Brucella species: Gram stain morphology: Small (0.4 x 0.8\u00b5m), Gram negative coccobacillus THINK BRUCELLA Colony morphology: Subculture positive blood culture to BAP, CHOC. Incubate in 5 -10% CO 2 at 35\u00b0C, Spot BAP with S. aureus ATCC 25923 for satellite test. Note poorly growing colonies after 24 hour incubation on BAP and CHOC. Incubate plates for at least two addition al days if no growth in 24 hours. Organism does NOT grow on MAC/EMB. (Pinpoint colonies infrequently after extended Incubation; 7 days) Is the organism only growing on BAP without the need to satellite around the S. aureus at 24 -48 hours? Oxidase positive and catalase positive? Urea positive? Consider Haemophil us Think Francisella (see procedure) Reincubate and see written procedure No No No Yes Yes Brucella not ruled out. Contact LRN Reference Level Laboratory to refer the isolate. Report: Possible Brucella species submitted to LRN Reference Laboratory. Rifampin or Streptomycin plus Doxycycline Yes ASM, 3/30/16 103 Refer the Patient Specimen or Isolate to your local LRN Reference Laboratory If the organism cannot be ruled out then you must secure all of the plates, tubes, bottles, slides, and clinical specimens in case the isolate is confirmed as a select agent. REPORTING AND NOTIFI CATION TO STAT E OR LOCAL PUBLIC HE ALTH Suspect cases should be immediately reported to the local health department for investigation. Prior to submitting specimens for testing, your LRN Reference Laboratory must be contacted for specimen submission guidance and to pro vide test notification. For confirmed cases, clinical laboratories must always refer to their State / Local and Federal disease notification and reporting requirements. See your state specific contact information in the State Section and the following lin k for Federal guidelines. http://www.selectagents.gov/ . When brucellosis is suspected in a patient, clinicians should note \"suspect or rule out brucellosis\" on the laboratory submission forms to inform any appr opriate personnel. If you see: Tiny (0.4 by 0.8 m), Gram negative, coccobacilli, that faintly stain on a Gram stain; Slow growing (48 hour) suspicious colonies from agar plates and positive blood culture bottles; Growth on both BAP and CHOC but not on MAC of pinpoint colonies at 24 hour, and more easily seen as white, non- hemolytic, non -mucoid colonies at 48 hour. NOTE: If a G ram negative rod or coccobacillus is isolated in a Sentinel Laboratory and it does not gr ow on MacConkey agar, it should not be processed for identification by a multi -test kit or automated system. If the above criteria are met, perform the following biochemical tests in a BSC: Oxidase test; Brucella species will be positive Catalase ucella species will be positive Urease test; Brucella species will be positive with varying result times NOTE: Urease production can be delayed and is not required to make the presumptive diagnosis. Then you cannot Rule -Out Brucella. Refer the Specimen or Isolate to your State or Local LRN Reference Laboratory. 1. Generate a report to the physician that Brucella species cannot be ruled out. 2. Do not attempt full identification and susceptibility testing in the Sentinel Clinical Laboratory. 3. Immediately notify y our designated LRN Reference Laboratory, which will provide the referring laboratory with guidance and recommendations for retaining the specimen or isolate and submission for confirmative identification. 104 4. Preserve original specimens pursuant to a potentia l criminal investigation and transfer to your designated LRN Reference Laboratory in accordance with state and local requirements. In particular, the appropriate material, including blood culture bottles, tubes and plates, and actual clinical specimens (as pirates, biopsies, sputum specimens) should be documented, and either submitted to the LRN Reference Laboratory or saved until the Reference Laboratory confirms the identification. 5. Do not ship specimens or cultures to LRN Reference Laboratories without prior arrangements. 6. Notify other public health authorities (e.g. state public health department epidemiologist/health officer) as required by local and state communicable disease repo rting requirements. The state public health laboratory/state public health department will notify law enforcement officials (state and federal), such as local FBI agents, as appropriate . 7. Within the hospital setting, immediately notify the infection preventionists and/or infectious disease service so that the patient can be treated appropriately, infectious precautions can be taken, and a further investigation of the patient's history can be made. 8. Consult with the LRN Reference Level Lab about additional c linical specimens that may be submitted for testing. 9. Initiate documentation, showing the specimen identification control, notification and transfer to the designated LRN Reference Laboratory, and documentation of all plates and tube cultures, which will ne ed to be destroyed or transferred once identification has been completed. Sentinel Laboratories should consult with the designated LRN Reference Laboratory prior to or concurrent with testing, if Brucella species is requested by the physician or a bioterrorist event is suspected. Obtain guidance from the state public health laboratory as appropriate (e.g., requests from local law enforcement or other local government officials). FBI and state public health laboratory/state public health department will coo rdinate the transfer of isolates/specimens to a higher- level LRN laboratory as appropriate . If Brucella species is ruled out, proceed with efforts to identify using established procedures. Reporting all identified Select Agents is required by completing Form 4 A within 7 days of confirmed identification. If the isolate is from a Proficiency test sample, Form 4 B is to be completed within 90 days of receipt of the sample. Your designated LRN Reference Laboratory will advise you with completion of required forms (e.g., Forms 2, 3, and 4). Always refer to www.selectagents.gov for the latest guidance and versions of these forms. SHIPPING AND TRANSFE RS Upon notification to the local health department epidemiology program and coordination with your local Publi c Health LRN Reference Laboratory of a suspected Brucella , laboratories should be prepared to properly package and ship the sample(s). If a culture is being submitted for LRN Rule -Out Testing, the shipment should be classified, handled, packaged and trans ported as \"Suspected Category A.\" Please note that an organism with a confirmed select agent identification will require a CDC/APHIS 105 Form 2 for transfer. See the Packaging and Shipping Section contained within this guidance manual for additional informat ion about sample classification and shipping procedures. DESTRUCTION AND DECO NTAMINATION The Public Health Agency of Canada has created Pathogen Safety Data Sheets for numerous human pathogens. These technical documents are intended to describe the hazardous properties of listed organisms and recommendations for work involving these agents in a laboratory setting. A complete list of the organisms as well as other safety related information is available here: http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/lab- bio/res/psds- ftss/index -eng.php . Brucella organisms are easily killed by common disinfectants and heat. Standard hospital approved disinfectants are adequate for cleaning patient rooms. Decontamination of laboratory surfaces is easily accomplished using a fresh solution of 10% household bleach. P lates and specimens should be destroyed as directed by the LRN R eference Laboratory when the identification is confirmed. If the identification is confirmed then you must either transfer or destroy all remaining materials, isolates, patient samples, etc. within 7 days. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section for directions on how to destroy, secure, or transfer the agent . (See DecontaminationSelectAgents_JobAid_10_06_2015_Final Job Aid ) Work with you r LRN Reference Laboratory on how to fill out the required paperwork. Your designated LRN Reference Laboratory must advise you on destruction or transfer of isolates. Generally, all plates and clinical material that contain the organism should be autocla ved, incinerated on-site or submitted to the designated LRN Reference Laboratory for disposal. Alternatively, contaminated items should be soaked in 10% bleach or 10% formalin for 24 hours. Brucella organisms can survive in carcasses and organs for up to 135 days, on paper for 32 days, in soil for 125 days, and in blood at 4\u00b0C for 180 days. Brucella species are susceptible to many disinfectants such as 1% sodium hypochlorite, 70% ethanol, iodine/alcohol solutions, glutaraldehyde, and formaldehyde. They are susceptible to moist heat (121\u00b0C for at least 15 min) and dry heat (160 -170\u00b0C for at least 1 hour). Brucella material should be decontaminated before disposal when possible (steam sterilization, incineration, chemical disinfection). If a spill occurs, a llow aerosols to settle; wearing protective clothing, gently cover spill with paper towels and apply 1% sodium hypochlorite, starting at perimeter and working towards the center; allow sufficient contact time (30 min) before clean up. 106 EXPOSURES AND MEDI CAL TREATMENT For those at risk of exposure, recommendations will vary depending on whether the risk is high or low. The CDC provides specific Brucella risk level guidance to guide lab workers on how to determine their risk level, which can be found here: http://www.cdc.gov/brucellosis/laboratories/risk -level.html . Reported activities related to Brucella exposure include: Sniffing bacteriological cultures Direct contact with cut or abraded skin Mouth pipetting Inoculations Sprays into eyes, nose, and mouth There are currently no vaccines available for use in humans in the U.S. and no identified prophylaxis. SEROLOGICAL MONITORI NG AFTER LABORATORY EXPOSURE The immune response to Bru cella is characterized by an initial production of IgM antibodies followed afterward by the production of IgG antibodies. The major antigens that are useful for diagnosis of brucellosis are the smooth (S) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of the outer membrane and internal proteins. The serum (tube) agglutination test (SAT) detects antibodies to the S -LPS. Antibodies reacting against S-LPS can also be detected by other tests, such as ELISA (enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay) and the Coombs test. It is important to n ote that the Coombs test remains positive longer than other agglutination tests. CDC recommends that Brucella serology testing only be performed using tests approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), or validated under the Clinical Laboratory Impr ovement Amendments (CLIA) and shown to reliably detect the presence of Brucella antibodies. Results from these tests should be considered supportive evidence for recent infection only and interpreted in the context of a clinically compatible illness and ex posure history. Serology for laboratory workers exposed to Brucella are drawn at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 weeks post exposure. Any potential exposures should be immediately reported to the local health department and will require the completion of CDC -APHIS For m 3. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity, and Regulations Section for more information and guidance ( Form 3: APHIS/CDC Select Agent Job Aid ) or the Select Agent website ( http://www.selectagents.gov/form3.html ).

DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION http://www.cdc.gov/glanders/ Glanders is an infectious disease that is caused by the bacterium Burkholderia mallei. Glanders is primarily a disease affecting horses, and human infections are extremely rare. It also affects donkeys and mules and can be naturally contracted by other mammals such as goats, dogs, and cats. Equines are the primary reservoir. Burkholderia mallei has been documented as a biowarfare agent in World War I. Symptoms of glanders commonly include: Fever with chills and sweat ing Muscle aches Chest pain Muscle tightness Headache Nasal discharge Light sensitivity (sometimes with excessive tearing of the eyes) The particular symptoms experienced, however, will vary depending on the type of infection. Infection of Burkholderia mal lei in humans is often fatal without medical intervention. The incubation period is typically one to fourteen days. The four types of infection are localized, pulmonary, bloodstream, and chronic. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS: As soon as Burkholderia mallei is suspected in the laboratory, perform ALL further work within in containment such as within a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) and observe and follow BSL -3 practices.

DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Melioidosis is caused by exposure to the Gram negativ e bacillus, Burkholderia pseudomallei , and infection can occur in both humans and animals. Melioidosis is also called Whitmore's disease, and it is considered to be primarily a tropical disease. In addition, melioidosis is sometimes referred to as the \"Vietnam time bomb\" since the disease can reactivate in returning Vietnam veterans after many years in latency. Common routes of infection include: Inhalation of contaminated dust, water droplets, or infectious aerosols Ingestion of contaminated water Cont act with contaminated soil Melioidosis has a wide range of symptoms that can mimic other diseases, including tuberculosis and common forms of pneumonia. Generally, symptoms appear two to four weeks after exposure, and treatment usually consists of an intensive phase with intravenous anti -microbial therapy for a minimum of 10 days, followed by an eradication phase with oral therapy for three to six months. The following types of infection and symptoms are listed below: Localized infection: localized p ain or swelling, fever, ulceration, abscess Pulmonary infection: cough, chest pain, high fever, headache, anorexia DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 SAFETY CONSIDERATION S: As soon as Burkholderia pseudomallei is suspected in the laboratory, perform ALL further work within in containment such as within a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) and observe and follow BSL -3 practices. 119 Bloodstream infection: fever, headache, respiratory distress, abdominal discomfort, joint pain, disorientation Disseminated infection: fever, weight loss, stomach or chest pain, muscle or joint pain, headache, seizures No vaccine is currently available for humans or animals to prevent infections with Burkholderia pseudomallei .

REFERENCES ASM Guidelines: LABORATORY PRAC TICES F. tularensis is a highly virulent bacterium (infectious dose is 10 - 50 cells) and is a highly infectious pathogen. Human clinical specimens (not cultures/isolates) suspected of containing F. tularensis can be processed with BSL -2 practices. If the initial Gram stain and/or culture is suggestive of F. tularensis , all manipulation s hould be performed in a biological safety cabinet (BSL -2) with BSL -3 practices. Suspected F. tularensis manipulation should be performed in a biological safety cabinet (BSL -2) with BSL -3 practices. Nonclinical (environmental or animal) samples or specimens should not be processed in hospital laboratories. Veterinary laboratories are equipped to handle animal specimens. Nonclinical specimens should be directed to the designated LRN Reference Laboratory. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regula tions section contained within this guidance manual, the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ ) and Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories ( http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6101a1.htm ) for more information. DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL P RESENTATION http://www.cdc.gov/tularemia/laboratoryexposure/ F. tularensis is a zoonotic pathogen that is widespread throughout the Northern Hemisphere and is responsible for recent tularemi a outbreaks in several countries including Norway and Turkey. Within the United States, tularemia has been reported in every state with the exception of Hawaii and approximately 120 cases are reported a year. F. tularensis is a zoonotic pathogen with an extremely wide host range that includes mammals, birds and amphibians. The primary hosts for F. tularensis are believed to be small rodents (hares, voles, muskrats). http://www.c dc.gov/tularemia/ Bite of an infected arthropod. Ticks, deer fly, horse fly and mosquitoes. SAFETY CONSIDERATION S: As soon as F rancisella tularensis is suspected in the laboratory, perform ALL further work within in containment such as within a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) and follow BSL -3 practices. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 130 Contact with infected animal or carcasses. Ingestion of contaminated food or water. Inhalation of infectious aerosols. The signs and symptoms of tularemia vary de pending on how the bacterium enters the body. Illness ranges from mild to life- threatening. All forms are accompanied by fever, which can be as high as 104 \u00b0F. Ulceroglandular This is the most common form of tularemia and usually occurs following a tick o r deer fly bite or after handling of an infected animal. A skin ulcer appears at the site where the organism entered the body. The ulcer is accompanied by swelling of regional lymph glands, usually in the armpit or groin. Glandular Similar to ulceroglandular tularemia but without an ulcer. Also generally acquired through the bite of an infected tick or deer fly or from handling sick or dead animals. Oculoglandular This form occurs when the bacteria enter through the eye. This can occur when a person is butc hering an infected animal and touches his or her eyes. Symptoms include irritation and inflammation of the eye and swelling of lymph glands in front of the ear. Oropharyngeal This form results from eating or drinking contaminated food or water. Patients with orophyangeal tularemia may have sore throat, mouth ulcers, tonsillitis, and swelling of lymph glands in the neck. Pneumonic This is the most serious form of tularemia. Sym ptoms include cough, chest pain, and difficulty breathing. This form results from breathing dusts or aerosols containing the organism. It can also occur when other forms of tularemia (e.g. ulceroglandular) are left untreated and the bacteria spread through the bloodstream to the lungs. 131 ACCEPTABLE SAMPLE TY PES http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines Collection and Transport of Clinical Specimen s for Laboratory Rule- Out Testing Tissue Biopsy, scraping of an ulcer, or conjunctival swab For small tissue samples, add several drops of sterile normal saline into a sterile container to keep the tissue moist Transport at room temperature for immediate processing If processing of specimen is delayed beyond 2 hours, keep specimen chilled (2- 8\u00b0C) Amies transport media is an appropriate transport medium Aspirate Lymph node or lesion Submit in a sterile container Transport at room temperature for immediate processing.

To avoi d exposures and potential laboratory acquired infections, work with suspicious cultures in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet using BSL -3 practices until the presence of a highly infectious agent has been ruled out. Plague is often misdiagnosed. It occurs rarely in the U.S. even in endemic areas, has a confusing array of clinical presentations, and early stages of disease may be non - specific. The clinical laboratory rarely gets advanced warning that a specimen from a patient suspected of having plagu e is coming. Watch for trigger points that may indicate the presence of Y. pestis and work in a BSC until it has been ruled out: Patient history of travel, hunting/trapping, camping, hiking or farming in, or emigration from, endemic areas. Patient occupation or hobby that may indicate a higher risk such as working with animals, gardener/landscaper, laboratory personnel. Growth from normally sterile sites (such as blood, CSF, body fluids, lymph node & other aspirates). Bipolar -staining gram -negative rods seen in direct Gram stain. Slow -growing organism, especially if no growth or poor growth on MAC. \"Sniffing\" plates is dangerous and has been linked to lab -acquired infections. Do not attempt to identify slow -growing or fastidious organisms on automa ted systems because of the potential for misleading/inaccurate IDs and the danger of aerosols that may cause exposures to personnel. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity, and Regulations section contained within this guidance manual, the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ ) and Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6101a1.htm ) for more information. SAFETY CONSIDERATION S: As soon as Yersinia pestis is suspected in the laboratory, perform ALL further work within containment such as a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) and observe and follow BSL -3 practices. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 141 DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Plague is a zoonotic disease caused by the gram -negative bacil lus Yersinia (formerly Pasteurella ) pestis , a member of the Enterobacteriaceae. It is endemic worldwide, including rural areas of the U.S. West and Southwest. There are 1 -17 human cases per year in the U.S., almost 50% of which are from New Mexico. Map of the U.S. showing the distribution of plague cases, 1970 -2012 from http://www.cdc.gov/plague/maps/index.html 142 In the U.S. plague can occur year- round, but is most common in the late spring to e arly fall, associated with climatic and environmental conditions that allow an increase in host rodent populations and their fleas. Host range: A number of species of rodent fleas act as natural vectors. Rodent reservoir (rock and ground squirrels, prairie dogs, chipmunks, deer mice, voles, rats, occasionally hares & rabbits). Most mammals, including humans and carnivores (such as bobcats, mountain lions, dogs & cats) are accidental hosts; not birds or reptiles. Cats & other felids are very susceptib le to plague and get very ill; dogs are more resistant. Pets act as \"sentinels\" for human infections. They can become infected by eating dead animals and may carry infected fleas back to their human owners. The host & geographic range of plague overlaps with tularemia - environmental surveillance will often include both, particularly in the Southwest. Infectious dose: unknown, but is thought to be low; perhaps as few as 100 organisms may cause infection depending on the mode of transmission. Modes of tr ansmission: Bite of infected flea Bite from an infected anima l (especially an issue for veterinarians) Contact with, or ingestion of, infected fluid or tissues Inhalation of infectious aerosols Communicability: Not usually transmissible from person -to- person except in pneumonic form (the most likely bioterrorism s cenario) Animal -to-person infections have occurred via infected droplets or bites (sick cats) Thrassis bacci 41 days after infection with Yersinia pestis Thrassis bacci , a ground squirrel flea found inhabiting the United States, is one of the primary rodent flea vectors of plague to humans. During feeding, the flea draws viable Y. pestis organisms into its esophagus, which multiply and block the proventriculus just in front of the stomach, later forcing the flea to regurgitate infected blood into the host when it tries to swallow. 143 Signs and Symptoms/Clinical Presentation: Depends on mode of transmission Can be confusing to clinician, may be non -specific in early stages, often misdiagnosed Bubonic Transmitted by the bite of an infected flea or exposure to infected material via a wound or break in the skin 2-6 day incubation Proliferation of bacteria at inoculation site forms a vesicle or ulcer Bacteria are transported to local lymph nodes which become extremely painful and inflamed (bubo) Fever, chills, headache, malaise; sometimes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain & diarrhea Most common clinical presentation of naturally -acquired disease Untreated mortality ~60%, prompt and appr opriate antibiotic treatment can reduce it to <5%. Untreated bubonic plague can progress to secondary septicemic if bacteria are able to invade the bloodstream Not transmitted person- to-person Septicemic Primary o Results from contact with, or being bitten by, an infected animal o The plague bacillus is directly inoculated into the bloodstream via a bite, wound or break in the skin o No buboes may be evident Secondary o Results from bubonic or pneumonic plague as organisms are spread through the bloodstream Initial fever, chills, headache, malaise Bacterial endotoxin production leads to multiple organ failure, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and respiratory distress Petechiae, necrosis and gangrene of the extremities (\"the black death\") May progr ess to secondary pneumonic plague as bacteria spread to the lungs through the bloodstream Untreated mortality ~100% Not transmitted person- to-person Pneumonic Primary o Results from inhalation of plague bacteria o 1-4 day incubation o Least common form of natur al infection 144 o Most probable presentation if intentional release as an aerosol Secondary o Results from spread through the bloodstream of bacteria from untreated bubonic or septicemic plague Fever, chills, headache, malaise, dyspnea, hemoptysis Rapidly fatal ( <24 hours, ~100% mortality) if untreated May be transmitted person -to-person, or animal -to-person, extremely contagious Bubonic Plague Septicemic Plague Pneumonic Plague ACCEPTABLE SAMPLE TY PES For a complete list of specimen types and their co llection and handling go to http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines : The \"Specimen collecti on/handling for Tier BT agents\" table in ASM's Clinical Laborat ory Bioterrorism Readiness Plan ASM's Sentinel Level Clinical Laboratory Guidelines for Yersinia pestis Collection and Transport of Clinical Specimens for Laboratory Rule- Out Testing Lower respiratory tract Transport specimens in sterile, screw -capped containers at room temperature. If it is known that material will be transported from 2- 24 h after collection, then store and transport at 2 -8\u00b0C Blood Transport samples directly to the laboratory at ambient temperature and place onto the blood culture instrument Do not refrigerate Follow established laboratory protocols for processing blood cultures Aspirate, tissue or biopsy specimen Submit tissue or aspirate in a sterile container. For small samples, add 1 -2 drops of sterile normal saline to keep the tissue moist. Transport sample at room temperature for immediate processing. Keep the specimen chilled if processing will be delayed (> 2 h). 145 Collection and Transport of Clinical Specimens for Laboratory Rule- Out Testing Swabs A swab of tissue is not recommended. However, if a swab specimen is collected, the swab should be reinserted into an appropriate transport package and sent to the laboratory at room temperature for immediate processing. Keep the specimen chilled if processing will be delayed (>2 h). MICROSCOPY CHARACTER ISTICS A plump, Gram negative rod (1.0 -2.0 x 0.5 \u00b5m). Single cells or pairs; chains in liquid media. Bipolar staining (\"safety pin\") with Wayson or Wright -Giemsa stains (may be available in hematology or histology) and may occasionally be seen in Gram stained preparations; more common in direct specimen material than from culture. Bipolar staining ( the ends of the cells are darker than the middle) should not be confused with the presence of spores. Note: Although characteristic of Y. pestis , bipolar staining is not always observable and is not unique for Y. pestis (other Yersinia spp., E. coli, Klebs iella, Pasteurella and Burkholderia spp . may also appear bipolar, for example). Broth and blood culture bottles positive for Y. pestis may reveal plump, bipolar rods in chains, a very unusual arrangement for a gram -negative rod. This distinctive feature can give a presumptive ID even before there is growth on solid media and should be immediately reported to the clinician and LRN reference lab as suspicious for Y. pestis. Gram stain of Yersinia pestis from a patient blood culture bottle Note cha ining and bipolar - staining Gram negative rods Gram stain from culture of Yersinia pestis 146 COLONY MORPHOLOGY AN D GROWTH CHARACTERIS TICS Grows well, but slowly, on most non -selective standard laboratory media (e.g., sheep blood, chocolate and tryptic soy agars). Grows more slowly than other Enterobacteriac eae at 35 -37\u00b0C, but faster than most other enterics at 25 -28\u00b0C (optimal but optional) . Pinpoint, gray -white to slightly yellow, opaque, raised, little or no hemolysis at 24 hours. 24 HOURS ON BAP at 25\u00b0C and 35\u00b0C 48 HOURS ON BAP @ 25\u00b0C @ 35\u00b0C @ 25\u00b0C @ 35\u00b0C 147 After 48 -72 hours colonies may have an irregular \"fried egg\" appearance (raised center with a flattened edge or \"skirt\") and a \"hammered copper\" surface (best seen with oblique light under magnification). Older colonies are adherent & sticky, forming strands when lifted from the agar with a loop. Grows on MacConkey (MAC) and Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) agar (may be delayed >24 hours), appearing as small non -lactose fermenting colonies. Grows well in routine blood culture systems. 72 HOURS ON BAP Note \"fried egg\" appearance (raised center with irregular, flat edge or \"skirt\") 48 HOURS ON BAP Note adherent, sticky colonies 24 HOURS ON MAC Note pinpoint, lactose -negative colonies 48 HOURS ON MAC Note small, lactose -negative colonies 148 BIOCHEMICAL PROFILE AND KEY ORGANISM CHA RACTERISTICS WARNING: Using automated systems, including Mass Spectrometry (MALDI -TOF ) technology may result in exposure to dangerous pathogens, and could result in erroneous identification, e.g., Bacillus anthracis misidentified as B. cereus ; Yersinia pestis misidentified as Y. pseudotuberculosis . MALDI -TOF IDENTIFICATION us es mass spectrometry (MALDI -TOF ) for bacterial identification, and if the manufacturer provides your facility with an alternate tube extraction method, it is recommended that the resulting extract be filtered using a 0.2 \u00b5m (or less) filter. This additional step is recommended to reduce the chance of laboratory contamination with viable bacteria and spores. Biochemical Tests to be performed include: CATALASE Warning! For safety purposes, it is recommended that this test be performed in a BSC, covered petri dish or tube to ensure the containment of aerosols that are produced when the test organism generates a positive result (production of bubbles). Y. pestis is catalase positive (+). OXIDASE Y. pestis is oxidase negative ( -). SPOT INDOLE Y. pestis is urease negative Y. pestis is indole negative (- ). 149 UREA Y. pestis is urease negative (- ). POSSIBLE MISIDENTIFICATIONS Yersinia pestis is included in the databases of most enteric identification systems, but confidence may be low due to the small number of strains included. Automated ID systems are not generally suitable for slow -growing &/or nutritionally fastidious isolates. Automated systems may produce aerosols and increase the risk for laboratory acquired infection. An identification of Y. pestis must be considered presumptive until confirmed by an LRN Reference Laboratory. 150 Possible Misidentifications for Yersinia pestis Include: Organism Differential Tests Acinetobacter spp. May appear as gram -negative coccobacilli, often in pairs Glucose non -fermenter Colony morphology E. coli, lactose- negative Faster growth Colony morphology Pantoea ( formerly Enterobacter) agglomerans yellow pigment ONPG positive (90%) Pasteurella multocida Faster growth rate Oxidase positive (may be Indole positive Colony morphology, may appear mucoid Pseudomonas luteola yellow pigment non -fermenter Oxidase positive (except Small gram * variable Yersinia pseudotuberculosis Urease positive * * Y. pseudotuberculosis and Y. enterocolitica give stronger reactions in urea agar or broth when incubated at 25- 28oC, but incubation at this temperature is not necessary to demonstrate urease production. LABORATORY TESTING I NFORMATION Since Yersinia pestis grows slowly, primary plates should be held for 5 -7 days. Setting up a second set of plates and incubating them at 25 -28\u00b0C may help isolate Y. pestis from other bacteria in mixed cultures from non- sterile sites (sputum, wounds and bites, for example) by o ut-competing them at the lower temperature. 151 If selective and differential CIN (Cefsulodin- Irgasan - Novobiocin) agar is available (usually used to isolate Yersinia enterocolitica ), it can also be used to separate Y. pestis from contaminating bacteria from non -sterile sites. Yersinia spp. (including Y. pestis ) colonies will have deep - red centers surrounded by a transparent border giving the appearance of a bulls -eye. If cultures from suspected plague cases are negative, serologic testing of paired sera (one sample from as early in the illness as possible plus a second at least 3 -4 weeks later) may be available. Contact your LRN reference lab for more information. In coordination with the CDC and the Association of Public Health Laboratories (APHL), the ASM provides protocols designed to offer Laboratory Response Network (LRN) Sentinel Level Clinical Laboratories standardized, practical methods and techniques to rule out microorganisms suspected as ag ents of bioterrorism, or to refer specimens to public health laboratories for confirmation.

Many infections were due to procedures involving hi gh virus concentrations and aerosol -generating activities such as centrifugation and mouth pipetting. Procedures involving animals (e.g., infection of newly hatched chicks with EEE virus and WEE virus) and mosquitoes also are particularly hazardous. Due to the high risk of aerosol infection, additional personal protective equipment, including respiratory protection, should be considered for non- immune personnel. Vaccines are available only on a limited basis and may be contraindicated for some personnel. Fo r personnel who have no neutralizing antibody titer (either by previous vaccination or natural infection), additional respiratory protection is recommended for all procedures. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section contained within this guidance manual, the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ ) and Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6101a1.htm ) for more information. DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Eastern Equine Encep halitis (EEE), and Chikungunya viruses (CHIKV) belong to the genus Alphaviruses within the family Togaviradae. These zoonotic viruses are maintained in natural transmission cycles of various mosquitoes and avian or small rodent hosts. Humans and horses are accidental hosts that become infected upon the bite of an infected mosquito. EEE virus occurs in focal locations along the eastern seaboard, the Gulf Coast and some inland Midwester n locations of the United States, in Canada, some Caribbean Islands, and Central and South America. The WEE virus is found mainly in western parts of the United States and Canada although sporadic infections also occur in Central and South America. People infected with Eastern equine encephalitis virus (EEE) can develop systemic (abrupt onset and is characterized by chills, fever, malaise, arthralgia, and myalgia) or encephalitic (fever, headache, irritability, restlessness, drowsiness, SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS: Diagnostic and research activities involving clinical material, infectious cultures, and infected animals or arthropods should be performed under BSL -3 practices, containment equipment, and facilities . DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 157 anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, cyanosis, convulsions, and coma) disease 4 to 10 days from being bitten by an infected mosquito. The type of illness will depend on the age of the person and other host factors. It is possible that some people who become infected with EEE may be asymptomatic. Currently, local Chikungunya transmission has been identified in 44 countries or territories throughout the Americas. Most people infected with Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) will develop acute fever and polyarthralgia usually beginning 3 -7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito. Although the most common clinical presentations of symptoms are acute onset of fever and polyarthralgia, specifically of the wrists and knees, however other symptoms may include headache, muscle pain, joint swell ing particularly of the hands and feet, or maculopapular rash. Chikungunya disease does not often result in death, but the symptoms can be severe and lead to chronic joint pain that in rare cases can be debilitating and lasts for months or years. Many pati ents will experience relapse of rheumatologic symptoms months after acute illness recovery. Common laboratory findings to help in diagnosis for CHIKV patients are lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia and elevated creatinine levels. Focal VEE virus outbreaks occ ur periodically in Central and South America, with rare large regional epizootics involving thousands of equine cases and deaths in predominantly rural settings. Epizootic and enzootic strains of the VEE virus range from northern Argentina to Florida and p arts of the Rocky Mountains; however, it is most prevalent in northern South America. VEE usually causes mild to severe influenza -like symptoms such as headache, myalgia, fatigue, vomiting, nausea, diarrhea, pharyngitis and fever appear abruptly, 2 to 5 d ays after exposure to the virus 4-14% of cases develop neurological complications such as somnolence, convulsions, confusion, photophobia, and coma that develop within 4 - 10 days after exposure. Long -term neurological damage can be caused by this virus and it can infect the fetus in pregnant women causing birth defects and stillbirths. Infectious dose for the alphaviruses remains unknown except for VEE. Studies have shown that only 1 virus particle is needed for VEE infection. Please refer to the following links for additional information: http://www.cdc.gov/EasternEquineEncephalitis/tech/factSheet.html http://www.cdc.gov/chikungun ya/ LABORATORY TESTING I NFORMATION Laboratory diagnosis of arboviral infections is generally accomplished by testing of serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to detect virus -specific IgM and neutralizing antibodies. Testing for IgM should only be performed i f symptoms onset was within 7 days of collection. If testing is requested after the patients initial acute phase (within 7 days of onset), convalescent serum testing can be performed by testing for both IgG and IgM to better confirm the patients results and time of exposure. For some alphaviruses like CHIKV, if a patient is still in acute phase PCR testing should be performed. PCR testing is now available for CHIKV through many commercial and public health laboratories and provides much more sensitive a nd specific result that can lead to a confirmed a patients diagnosis. 158 In fatal cases, nucleic acid amplification, histopathology with immunohistochemistry and virus culture of autopsy tissues can also be useful. Some state public health laboratories or o ther specialized laboratories, including those at CDC, are capable of doing this specialized testing. Contact your local epidemiology department or your state public health department for specific testing and collection guidance. *Confirmed EEE virus and VEE virus and genomic material are select agents requiring additional actions to comply with the Federal Select Agent regulations. REPORTING AND NOTIFI CATION TO STATE OR L OCAL PUBLIC HEALTH Suspect cases should be immediately reported to the local health department for investigation.

You can also contact your LRN APHL/EID Fellow Amanda Candee collecting environmental samples from a sheep pen in western Colorado. Sheep are a major reservoir for Coxiella burnetii. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR SAFE LABORATORY PRAC TICES Because of the highly infectious nature of this organism (Biosafety Level 3 [BSL -3]), specimens from suspected cases of Q fever should be immediately forwarded to a Local or State Health Department identified as your Laboratory Response Network (LRN) Reference Laboratory. Sentinel Laboratories should not attemp t to culture this organism, but should be aware of the potential for inadvertent isolation of C. burnetii in cell culture systems designed for virus isolation. Biohazardous waste should be decontaminated by autoclaving. Contaminated equipment or instrumen ts can be decontaminated with approved disinfectants. Special decontamination procedures are necessary for surfaces potentially contaminated with C. burnetii . Household bleach solutions may be ineffective. Minor spills should be covered with absorbent paper, such as paper towels, and then flooded with 70 -95% alcohol or 5% MicroChem -Plus (a dual quaternary ammonium compound), which should be allowed to act for 30 min before cleanup. Spills that involve samples with high concentrations of organisms, involve organic matter, or occur in areas of lower temperatures (e.g., refrigerators or freezers), should be exposed to disinfectant solution for 1 h before cleanup. See the American Society for Microbiology (ASM) Guidelines to C. burnetii: http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel - guidelines . Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section contained within this guidance manual, the Biosafety in Microbiol ogical and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ ) and Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6101a1.htm ) for more information. SAFETY CONSIDERATION S: As soon as Coxiella burnetii is suspected in the laboratory, perform ALL further work within in containment such as within a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) and observe and follow BSL -3 practices when possible. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CULTURE THIS ORGANISM. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 165 DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Q fever is a zoonotic disease caused by Coxiella burnetii, a species of bacteria that is distributed globally. Cattle, sheep, and goats are the primary reservoirs of C. burnetii. C. burnetii is an intracellular bacterium that must be grown in cell culture. Modes of transmission to humans include tick bites and ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy produc ts. Human to human transmission is rare. Humans are often very susceptible to the disease, and very few organisms may be required to cause infection. ACCEPTABLE SAMPLE TY PES DO NOT ATTEMPT TO CULTURE THIS ORGANISM but be aware of the potential for inadvertent isolation of C. burnetii in cell culture systems designed for virus isolation.

REFERENCES CDC Smallpox http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/lab -testing/ Biosafety in Microbiological and TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Ricin is a bio toxin that is purified from the hull of the castor bean and is one of the most toxic biologic agents known. Ricin is a toxalbumin, a biological toxin whose mechanism of action is inhibition of protein synthesis (manufacture of proteins) in eukaryotic cells; cell death results from the absence of proteins. The effects of ricin poisoning depend upon the amount of ricin exposure, the route of exposure and the person's premorbid condition. Ingestion and mastication of three to eight castor beans is the estimated fatal dose in adults. The fatal dose in children is not known, but likely is less. Ricin is not as well absorbed into the body via ingestion when compared to injection or inhalation. Inhalation or injection of ricin would be expected to lead to a more rapid onset of signs and symptoms of ricin poisoning and a more rapid progression of poisoning compared to ingestion, given the same exposure amount. CDC Facts about Ricin: http://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/ricin/facts.asp RICIN TOXIN beans Pathogenesis: B-chain binds to carbohydrate receptors on the cell wall and allows toxin complex to enter the cell A-chain inactivates ribosomes and halts protein synthesis Symptoms : 6-18 hrs post exposure Fever, cough, chest tightness, dyspnea, cyanosis, Gastroenteritis and necrosis; death in ~72 hrs Toxicity : (route dependent): SAFETY CONSIDERATION S: Ricin is a highly toxic poison found naturally in castor beans, which are seeds from the plant Ricinus communis . Ricin is poisonous if ingested, inhaled or injected. There is no antidote or specific medical treatment available. Patients receive supportive care to minimize the effects of the poison. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 174 Low oral toxicity due to poor absorption and enzymatic digestion in the GI tract Low dermal toxicity unless mixed with a strong solvent High inhalation toxicity resulting in severe necrosis and pneumonia High injection toxicity resulting in necrosis LABORATORY TESTING I NFORMATI ON Ricin samples may be tested at your LRN Reference Laboratory in one of two ways, either as an environmental sample of the ricin protein itself or from the ricinine marker for ricin from patient urine samples of someone suspected of having been exposed to ricin. ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLE S Ricin environmental samples are a Hazardous Material and should be handled only by a Hazmat specialist. Contact your local Police Department for further assistance. PATIENT SAMPLES To check for chemical exposure to ricin, patient samples are tested by the State Public Health Laboratory Chemical Emergency Response Section or LRN -C laboratory if they are capable of testing for ricinine, a marker for ricin. If they are not capable of testing, t hey will forward the samples to CDC or to a LRN -C laboratory that is able to test for it. REPORTING AND NOTIFI CATION TO STATE OR L OCAL PUBLIC HEALTH Suspect cases should be immediately reported to the local health department for investigation. Prior to submitting specimens for testing, your public health laboratory must be contacted for specimen submission guidance and to provide test notification. For confirmed cases, clinical laboratories must always refer to their State or Local disease notificatio n and reporting requirements. See your state specific contact information in the State Section and the following link for Federal guidelines. http://www.selectagents.gov/ SHIPPING AND TRANSFE RS Upon notification to the local health department epidemiology program and coordination with your local Public Health LRN Reference Laboratory of a suspected case of Ricin poisoning, laboratories should be prepared to properly package and ship the sample(s). See the Pac kaging and Shipping Section contained within this guidance manual for additional information about sample classification and shipping procedures. Please note that a confirmed select agent will require a CDC/APHIS Form 2 for transfer. 175 DESTRUCTION AN D DECONTAMINATION If the identification is confirmed then you must either transfer or destroy all remaining materials, patient samples, etc. within 7 days. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section for directions on how to destroy, secure, or transfer the agent (See DecontaminationSelectAgents_JobAid_10_06_2015_Final Job Aid ). Work with your LRN Reference Laboratory on how to fill out the required paperwork. EXPOSURES / MEDICAL/ CASE DEFINITION There is no antidote or specific medical treatment. Any potential exposures should be immediately reported to the local health department and will require completion of CDC -APHIS Form 3. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity, and Regulations Section for mor e information and guidance ( Form 3: APHIS/CDC Select Agent Job Aid ) or the Select Agent website (http://www.selectagents.gov/form3.html ). You can also contact your LRN Referenc e Laboratory for assistance. Accidental exposure to ricin is extremely unlikely, therefore it would take a deliberate act to make ricin and use it to poison people. There three routes of exposure for ricin: inhalation, ingestion, or injection. People can be poisoned by breathing in ricin mist or powder, swallowing food or water contaminated with ricin, or having a ricin pellet or ricin dissolved in a liquid injected into their bodies. Ricin poisoning is not contagious. It cannot be spread from person to p erson through casual contact. The symptoms of ricin poisoning depend on the route of exposure and the dose received. Many organs may be affected in severe cases. Death from ricin poisoning could take place within 36 to 72 hours of exposure, depending on the route of exposure (inhalation, ingestion, or injection) and the dose received. If death has not occurred in 3 to 5 days, the victim usually recovers. Inhalation : Initial symptoms of ricin poisoning by inhalation may occur within 8 hours of exposure. The likely symptoms would be respiratory distress (difficulty breathing), fever, cough, nausea, and tightness in the chest. Heavy sweating may follow as well as fluid building up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). This would make breathing even more difficult, and the skin might turn blue. Excess fluid in the lungs would be diagnosed by x -ray or by listening to the chest with a stethoscope. Finally, low blood pressure and respiratory failure may occur, leading to death. Ingestion : Following ingestion of ricin, initial symptoms typically occur in less than 6 hours. If someone swallows a significant amount of ricin, he or she would develop vomiting and diarrhea that may beco me bloody. Severe dehydration may be the result, followed by low blood pressure. Other signs or symptoms may include hallucinations, seizures, and blood in the urine. Within several days, the person's liver, spleen, and kidneys might stop working, and the person could die. Skin and eye exposure : Ricin in the powder or mist form could cause redness and pain of the skin and the eyes. 176 Note : Showing these signs and symptoms does not necessarily mean that a person has been exposed to ricin. Quick Facts a bout Ri cin Ricin is a highly toxic poison found naturally in castor beans, which are seeds from the plant Ricinus communis . Ricin is poisonous if ingested, inhaled or injected; the symptoms vary depending upon the route of exposure. It acts as a toxin by inhibiti ng protein synthesis. It is highly unlikely that individuals would be exposed unintentionally to ricin, unless they ingest the castor beans. Making ricin is a deliberate act meant to poison people. Due to its availability, the US has had several cases where ricin was used to kill or cause illness in others, and to create panic. Public Health Laboratories that are members of the LRN test for ricin and ricinine. Ricinine in urine indicates ricin exposure. Ricin poisoning is not contagious. It cannot be spread through casual contact. However, individuals could be exposed if they have contact with others who have the ricin toxin on their clothing. There is no antidote or specific medical treatment. Victims receive supportive care to minimize the effects of the p oison.

The use of a laboratory coat, gloves and safety glasses is mandatory when handling toxin or toxin- conta minated solutions. Frequent and careful hand -washing and laboratory decontamination should be strictly enforced when working with Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB). Depending upon a risk assessment of the laboratory operation, the use of a disposable face mask may be required to avoid accidental ingestion. BSL-3 facilities, equipment, and practices are indicated for activities with a high potential for aerosol or droplet production and those involving the use of large quantities of SEB. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section contained within this guidance manual, the Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories (BMBL) (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publica tions/bmbl5/ ) and Guidelines for Safe Work Practices in Human and Animal Medical Diagnostic Laboratories (http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su6101a1.htm ) for more information. DISEASE TRANSMISSION A ND CLINICAL PRESENTA TION Staphylococcal enterotoxin B is an extracellular protein toxin produced by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. Although SEB has been associated with foodborne illness, SEB has been weaponized in several countries for its use as a biological weapon. Staphylococcus aureus can be found worldwide and food intoxication is both widespread and relatively common. SEB toxin may be acquired by either food, water, or an aerosol resulting in a temporary, highly incapacita ting illness rather than death. Staphylococcus enterotoxin B is designated as Select Agent according to Federal Select Agents and Toxins Regulations. Federal regulations can be viewed at http://www.selectagents.gov/ . If a bioterrorism incident is suspected, clinical specimens and culture isolates should be referred to your local public health LRN reference lab and notification of the local health department should be done immediately. See the ASM Staphylococcal Enterotoxin B guidelines for additional information at http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines SAFETY CONSIDERATION S: According to the biosafety in microbiological and biomedical laboratories (BMBL) 5th edition, the most common cause of labor atory SEB intoxication is expected to result from accidental self -exposure via the mucous membranes by touching contaminated hands to the face or eyes. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 178 LABORATORY TESTING I NFORMATION Exposure t o SEB as a result of a bioterrorist event may include exposure to the enterotoxin alone or both the organism S. aureus and the enterotoxin. The diagnosis of SEB intoxication is primarily clinical, with confirmation by epidemiologic assays of environmental or clinical specimens. Routine laboratory findings are nonspecific and therefore not helpful in the diagnosis of SEB intoxication. Specialized testing is currently performed in select laboratories which may include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect SEB gene sequences in environmental, food, and clinical specimens, or enzyme immunoassay (EIA) to detect the toxin in food and toxin production by S. aureus isolates. Culture may also be performed on any sample type. Contact your assigned LRN laboratory f or testing assistance. Refer to the ASM Sentinel Level Clinical Laboratory Protocols for more detailed information: http://www.asm.org/index.php/science- skills -in-the-lab/sentinel -guidelines . For additional testing information, please contact your local LRN Reference Laboratory. ACCEPTABLE SAMPLE TY PES Culture isolate - Prepare fresh subculture on agar slant or transport swab. Store at room temperature and transport at 2 -8\u00b0C. Clinical - Contact your designated LRN Reference level laboratory for specific guidance prior to specimen collection. Food - Sentinel laboratories should forward these specimens directly to an LRN Reference or FERN laboratory. Specimens should be stored and transported at 2 -8\u00b0C. Environmental (non- food ) - Sentinel facilities should not attempt to collect these samples. Contact your designated LRN Reference level laboratory for guidance. REPORTING AND NOTIFI CATION TO STATE OR L OCAL PUBLIC HEALTH Suspe ct cases should be immediately reported to the local health department for investigation. Prior to submitting specimens for testing, your LRN Reference Laboratory must be contacted for specimen submission guidance and to provide test notification. For con firmed cases, clinical laboratories must always refer to their State / Local and Federal disease notification and reporting requirements. See your state specific contact information in the State Section and the following link for Federal guidelines. http://www.selectagents.gov/ SHIPPING AND TRANSFE RS Upon notification to the local health department epidemiology program and coordination with your local Public Health LRN Reference Laboratory of a suspected bioterrorism event involving Staphylococcus enterotoxin B, laboratories should be prepared to properly package and ship the sample(s). If a culture is being submitted for LRN Rule -Out Testing, the shipment should be classified, handled, packaged and transported as \"Suspected Category A.\" Please note that SEB is a select agent 179 requiring registration with the Select Agent and Toxin Division for possession, use, storage and/or the transfer of confirmatory material and will require a CDC/APHIS Form 2 for transfer. See the Packaging and Shipping Section contained within this guidance manual for additional information about sample classification and shipping procedures. DESTRUCTION AND DECO NTAMINATION To ensure complete inactivation, contaminated items should be steam autoclaved at >121\u00b0C for one hour (2 hours for volumes greater than 1 liter) and then incinerated. Contaminated surfaces should be treated with fresh 0.5% hypochlorite for 15 minutes (http://www.cdc.gov/biosafety/publications/bmbl5/ ). Staphylococcus enterotoxin B is a Select Agent. If the identification of Staphylococcus enterotoxin B is confirmed then you must either transfer or destroy all remaining materials, isolates, patient samples, etc. within 7 days. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section for directions on how to destroy, secure, or transfer the agent (See DecontaminationSelectAgents_JobAid_10_06_2015_Final Job Aid ). Work with your LRN Reference Laboratory on how to fill o ut the required paperwork. EXPOSURES / MEDICAL/ CASE DEFINITION There is no approved vaccination or specific antidote currently available for human use. Any potential exposure should be immediately reported to the local health department and will require the completion of CDC -APHIS Form 3. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity, and Regulations Section for more information and guidance ( Form 3: APHIS/CDC Select Agent Job Aid ) or the Select Agent website ( http://www.selectagents.gov/form3.html ). You can also contact your LRN Reference assistance. REFERENCES http://www.cdc.gov/biosafet SAFE LABORATORY PRAC TICES Recommendations for safely collecting and transporting specimens remain unchanged. The essential specimens to be submitted for vi rus isolation are a sample of venous blood, a midstream (\"clean catch\") specimen of urine, and a throat swab. If postmortem specimens are available, serum, liver, spleen, and kidney tissue are desirable. The following procedures should be followed: 1. Glass c ontainers should not be used. Disposable sharp objects, such as scalpel blades, also should not be handled unnecessarily after use and should be autoclaved or incinerated. 2. Venous blood samples must be collected with extreme care to avoid self -inoculation. 10 mL of clotted blood should be placed in a sealed plastic container. Needles should not be recapped, bent, broken, removed from disposable syringes, or otherwise handled. Blood -taking equipment should be put in a rigid plastic container filled with disin fectant solution and autoclaved or incinerated. 3. Midstream urine specimens should be collected by clean catch. Five milliliters of urine should be put in a plastic screw -cap container with one of the following: rabbit serum albumin diluted to a final concentration of 25%, human serum albumin diluted to a 1% concentration, or bovine serum albumin at a final concentration of 10%. 4. Throat swabs should be placed in plastic screw -cap containers in 1 m L of sterile, phosphate - buffered neutral saline containing 25% bovine serum albumin. The outside of each specimen container should be swabbed with disinfectant, and a label should be attached bearing the patient's name, hospital identification, the date of collection, and t he nature of the suspected infection. Then, the specimens should be double- bagged in secure, airtight and watertight bags, which have been similarly labeled. Bags containing specimens should be sponged with disinfectant before they are removed from the pat ient's room. MOBILE LABORATORY CDC has adapted a mobile isolator that can be used as a portable laboratory to investigate cases of suspec ted or confirmed VHF safely . This facility can be transported immediately to any part of the United States, with an ac companying technician and physician experienced in dealing with SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS: As soon as any Viral Hemorrhagic Fever is suspected, Contact your State or County Health Departments. ALL laboratory work must be completed in a Class II Biological Safety Cabinet (BSC) following BSL- 3 practices and in the CDC recommended PPE. DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 181 hemorrhagic fevers. The mobile laboratory has facilities for routine hematologic and biochemical studies, as well as for basic bacteriologic and coagulation investigations. Serodiagnostic tests for VHF can be performed in this facility, but cultures for virus isolation cannot. Electrolyte measurements on inactivated serum specimens are also possible, but blood gas analysis is not. Early use of this facility is preferable to delays in investigat ing the suspected case because of concern about the hazards of handling specimens. Further information about the mobile laboratory and its use can be obtained from the persons listed in the Introduction. DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND CLINICAL PRESENT ATION Viral hemorrhagic fevers (VHFs) refer to a group of illnesses that are caused by several distinct families of viruses. In general, the term \"viral hemorrhagic fever\" is used to describe a severe multisystem syndrome (multisystem in that multiple organ systems in the body are affected) where the overall vascular system is damaged, and the body's ability to regulate itself is impaired. Symptoms are often accompanied by hemorrhage (bleeding); however, the bleeding itself is rarely life-threatening. While some t ypes of hemorrhagic fever viruses can cause relatively mild illnesses, many of these viruses cause severe, life- threatening disease. Most hemorrhagic fever viruses are classified as risk group 4 (refer to the BMBL for more information) pathogens and isola tes must be handled in a BSL -4 laboratory. A list of these viruses appears in the Special Pathogens Branch disease information index: www.cdc.gov/ncezid/dhcpp/vspb/diseases.html . The two non-risk 4 viruses that cause hemorrhagic fevers are Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Yellow Fever. Most VHFs are zoonotic. This means that these viruses naturally reside in an animal reservoir host or arthropod vector. They are totally dependent on their hosts for replication and overall survival. For the most part, rodents and arthropods are the main reservoirs for viruses causing VHFs. Viruses that cause VHFs are distributed over much of the globe. However, because each virus is associated with one or more particular host species, the virus and the disease it causes are usually seen only where the host species live(s). Viruses causing hemorrhagic fever are initially transmitted to humans when the activities of infected reservoir hosts or vectors and humans overlap. The viruses carried in rodent reservoirs are transmitted when humans have contact with urine, fecal matter, saliva, or other body excretions from infected rodents. The viruses associated with arthropod vectors are spread most often when the vector mosquito or tick bites a human, or when a human crushes a tick. However, some of these vectors may spread virus to animals, livestock, for example. Humans then become infected when they care for or slaughter the animals. Some viruses that cause hemorrhagic fever can spread from one person to another, once an initial person has become infected. Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Crimean -Congo hemorrhagic fever viruses are examples. See additional section for Ebola specific instructions. This type of secondary transmission of 182 the virus can occur directly, through close contact with infected people or their body fluids. It can a lso occur indirectly, through contact with objects contaminated with infected body fluids. For example, contaminated syringes and needles have played an important role in spreading infection in outbreaks of Ebola hemorrhagic fever and Lassa fever. VHF SYM PTOMS Specific signs and symptoms vary by the type of VHF, but initial signs and symptoms often include marked fever, fatigue, dizziness, muscle aches, loss of strength, and exhaustion. Patients with severe cases of VHF often show signs of bleeding under the skin, in internal organs, or from body orifices like the mouth, eyes, or ears. Although they may bleed from many sites around the body, patients rarely die because of blood loss. Severely ill patient cases may also show shock, nervous system malfunct ion, coma, delirium, and seizures. Some types of VHF are associated with renal (kidney) failure. World Health Organization (WHO) http://www.who.int/topics/haemorrhagic_fevers_viral/en/ Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC) Review the CDC guidelines to submit specimens to CDC. Forms are available or call the CDC's Emergency Operations Center (http://www.cdc.gov/phpr/eoc_responses.htm ) at 770- 488- 7100. Consult with your state Public Health Department before sending any specimens to CDC. PACKAGING & SHIPPING REQUIREMENTS Upon notification to the local health department epidemiology program and coordination with your local Public Health LRN Reference Laboratory of a suspected VHF, laboratories should be prepared to properly package and ship the sample(s). If a sample is bei ng submitted for suspected VHF testing, the shipment should be classified, handled, packaged and transported as \"Suspected Category A.\" A sample that has already been identified or if there is a high likelihood of VHF, then the term \"suspect\" can no longer be used. It must be classified as Category A. Some carriers will not accept Risk Group 4 183 organisms (e.g., VHF), so always consult with your carrier. Please note that an organism with a confirmed select agent identification will require a CDC/APHIS Form 2 for transfer. See the Packaging and Shipping section for detailed instructions on how to ship this specimen to your LRN Reference Laboratory. EBOLA SPECIFIC GUIDA NCE Ebola was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, outbreaks of Ebola among humans have appeared sporadically in Africa. The 2014 Ebola epidemic is the largest in history with 27,636 cases and 11,268 deaths to date and affecting multiple countries in West Africa (Guinea, Si erra Leone, and Liberia). In the United States there were two imported cases, including one death, and two locally acquired cases in healthcare workers. EXPOSURES Family members or healthcare providers caring for Ebola patients and others who have close contact are at the greatest risk of contracting the disease because of the potential of coming in contact with infected blood or body fluids. Ebola also can be spread through direct contact with objects contaminated with infected blood or body fluids (like clothes, bedding, needles, syringes/sharps or medical equipment). Additionally, people can become sick with Ebola after coming in contact with infected wildlife or after handling meat from an infected animal. New evidence also suggests that it is possible that Ebola could be spread through sex or other contact with semen from men who have survived Ebola. It is not known if Ebola can be spread through sex or other contact with vaginal fluids from a woman who has had Ebola. http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/exposure/index.html REPORTING AND NOTIFI CATION TO STATE OR L OCAL PUBLIC HEALTH Suspect cases of EVD should be immediately reported to the local health department for investigation. Prior to submitting specimens for testing, your public health laboratory must be contacted for specimen submission guidance and to provide test notification. For confirmed cases, clinical laboratories must always refer to their State or Local disease notificati on and reporting requirements. See your state specific contact information in the State Section and the following link for Federal guidelines. http://www.selectagents.gov/ Specimens should be obtained when a patient meets the criteria for person under investigation (PUI) including patients with clinical signs, symptoms, and epidemiological risk factor (exposure opportunities) for Ebola virus disease. If the first specimen is obtained 1 -3 days after the onset of 184 symptoms and tests negative and the patient remains symptomatic without another diagnosis, a later specimen may be needed to rule- out Ebola vir us infection. ACCEPTABLE SAMPLE TY PES For adults, a minimum volume of 4 mL whole blood is preferable. For pediatric samples, a minimum of 1 mL whole blood should be collected in pediatric -sized collection tubes. Blood must be collected in plastic collect ion tubes. Do not transport or ship specimens in glass containers or in heparinized tubes. Whole blood preserved with EDTA is preferred, but whole blood preserved with sodium polyanethol sulfonate, citrate or with clot activator is also acceptable. Do not separate and remove serum or plasma from the primary collection container. Specimens should be packaged and transported at 2\u00b0 -8\u00b0C with cold -packs to the final testing destination. Specimens other than blood may be submitted after consultation with CDC by calling the EOC at 770 - 488- 7100. STORING CLINICAL SPE CIMENS FOR EBOLA TES TING If necessary, short -term storage of specimens before shipping should be at 4\u00b0C or frozen. DIAGNOSTIC TESTING F OR EBOLA VIRUS Real -time PCR testing for Ebola virus is availab le at over 50 LRN Reference Laboratories located throughout the United States. LRN Reference Laboratories are currently using an FDA approved Emergency Use Only (EUA) assay to detect the Ebola (Zaire species) virus. Samples that test positive using this assay are considered presumptive positive for Ebola Zaire RNA by real time RT -PCR and should be submitted to CDC for additional evaluation. SHIPPING AND TRANSFE RS Upon notification to the local health department epidemiology program and coordination with your local Public Health LRN Reference Laboratory of a suspected EVD case, laboratories should be prepared to properly package and ship the sample(s). PPE to be worn during transport within the facility should be determined by a site- specific risk assessment, and may vary among facilities. Recommendations for PPE include disposable fluid - resistant closed lab coat, disposable gloves, covered legs and closed -toed shoes. 185 Before removing patient specimens from the site of care, it is advisable to plan the ro ute of the sample from the patient area to the location where it will be packed for shipping in order to avoid high traffic areas. Before removing patient specimens from the site of care, the outside of the specimen containers should be decontaminated wit h an approved disinfectant as described in Interim Guidance for Environmental Infection Control in Hospitals for Ebola Virus . In compliance with OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens S tandard (29 CFR 1910.1030 ), specimens should be placed in a durable, leak -proof secondary container. After placin g in a secondary container, specimens should be hand -carried to the laboratory or packing area. DO NOT use any pneumatic tube system (automated or vacuum specimen delivery system) for transporting specimens. TRANSPORTING SPECIME NS FOR EBOLA TESTING TO SIT ES OUTSIDE THE FACIL ITY Samples from patients that are suspected of or confirmed to have Ebola virus infection should be packaged and shipped as Category A infectious substances in accordance with the DOT's Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) 49 CFR 171 -180. All persons packing and shipping infectious substances must be trained and c ertified in compliance with DOT or the International Air Transport Association (IATA) requirements every two years. Specimens collected for Ebola virus testing should be packed and shipped without attempting to open collection tubes or aliquot specimens. Opening the tubes destroys the vacuum seal and thus increases the ri sk of leakage during transport. See the Packaging and Shipping section for detailed instructions on how to ship this specimen to your LRN Reference Laboratory. WHEN TO CONTACT CDC Hospitals should contact their state and/or local health department before contacting CDC. CDC is available for consultation at 770 -488- 7100. CDC will continue to evaluate new information as it becomes available and will update this guidance as needed. DESTRUCTION AND DECO NTAMINATION Note : Recommended disinfectants are those known to kill non- enveloped viruses and can be found in List L of EPA's Disinfectants for Use Against the Ebola Virus . This list of registered disinfectants meets the CDC's criteria for use against the Ebola virus on hard, non- porous surfaces. The Public Health Agency of Canada has created Pathogen Safety Data Sheets for numerous human pathogens. These technical documents are intended to describe the hazardous properties of listed organisms and recommendations for work involving these agents in a laboratory setting. A complete list of the organisms as well as other safety related information is available here: 186 http://www.phac -aspc.gc.ca/lab- bio/res/psds- ftss/index -eng.php . If the identification is confirmed then you must either transfer or destroy all remaining materials, isolates, patient samples, etc. within 7 days. Refer to the Biosafety, Biosecurity and Regulations section for directions on how to destro y, secure, or transfer the agent (See DecontaminationSelectAgents_JobAid_10_06_2015_Final Job Aid ).

Shippers are responsible for correctly classifying a nd packaging the material(s) for the purpose of protecting the public, personnel in the transportation industry, emergency responders, as well as other laboratory or healthcare staff from accidental exposure to the contents of the packages. The responsibil ity to correctly package and ship infectious material is that of the sender, not the recipient or consignee. Correctly preparing a hazardous package is accomplished by complying with specific federal, state and carrier requirements and regulations. The f ollowing guidance is not intended to be an all -inclusive guide to packing and shipping regulations, but will describe basic packaging and shipping of dangerous goods, which may pose an unreasonable risk to health and safety when transported in commerce. This guidance is specifically intended to be an overview for Sentinel Laboratories submitting potential biothreat agents or other infectious material to Public Health and Laboratory Response Network (LRN) Reference Laboratories, but will also serve useful to anyone packaging and shipping infectious material. Therefore, adherence to the listed regulations and requirements will minimize the potential for damage to the contents of the package during transport, will reduce the potential risks of exposure to the c ontained material, and will reduce the risks of potential criminal and civil liability associated with the improper shipment of dangerous goods. REGULATORY OVERVIEW Hazardous material regulations cover a wide range of hazards, substances, means of transpo rt, and are governed by several regulatory agencies. This guidance will demonstrate how infectious substances are classified as hazardous material and how they must conform to all applicable regulations and requirements. The requirements and regulations go verning the transport of infectious substances are developed and published by many authorities and commercial carriers, and are revised frequently. Shippers are responsible for being aware of these changes, being appropriately trained and certified, adheri ng to current regulations, interpreting applicable regulations for themselves and their facilities, and packing and shipping infectious substances appropriately. Most regulations for air transport of dangerous goods throughout the world originate as Model Regulation decisions developed by the United Nations (UN). The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) uses these Model Regulations to develop formal and standardized Technical Instructions for the Safe Transportation of Dangerous Goods by Air fo r use in international aviation. These Technical Instructions are the standards for the international shipment of dangerous goods by air. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) uses the Technical Instructions to develop the Dangerous Goods Re gulations (DGR). The IATA DGR requirements have become the most widely DATE APPROVED: 8 /1 / 2016 191 recognized, copied, and used packing and shipping guidelines in the world. Most national and international regulations are based on, or are at least in substantial agreement (harmoniza tion) with IATA DGR requirements. For the purposes of air transport of infectious substances in the U.S., shippers observing and maintaining compliance with the IATA requirements will also help ensure compliance with U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Hazardous Material Regulations (HMR). In the United States, the DOT regulates the commercial transportation of dangerous goods by both air and ground carriers. Just as IATA derives its requirements from ICAO, the DOT also derives its regulations from ICAO . IATA requirements and DOT regulations mandate the minimum standards for packing infectious substances that could pose a threat to humans, animals or the environment. The safe and legal transport of infectious substances is based on the following primary goals for protecting the shipper, transporter, recipient, and the public from exposure to the infectious materials; these goals are outlined in the following mandated activities: Training and Certification Hazard Classification Appropriate Packaging Prop er Labeling and Marking Documentation Transport Incident and Emergency Response The following groups are associated with infectious substance shipping regulations and requirements: CDC - CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) regulates the importation of infectious biological agents, infectious substances, and vectors of human disease into the United States through its Import Permit Program (IPP). Further information regarding permits is contained belo w in the Transfer & Permits Section. The CDC also oversees the transportation of all Select Biological Agents and Toxins in the U.S. Information regarding the Select Biological Agents and Toxin regulations is available here: http://www.selectagents.gov/regulations.html . Facilities that possess select agents must have a written Hazardous Material Security Plan in place on site. Additional information about Hazardous Material Security Plan requirements is listed in the DOT Section and in the Training Section of this guidanc e. 192 DOT - UNITED STATES DEPART MENT OF TRANSPORTATI ON The United States Department of Transportation (DOT) is the Federal agency which regulates domestic transportation of all hazardous material into and within the U.S. through regulations published in t he Federal Register known as the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). DOT issues the Hazardous Material Regulations (HMR) which applies to any material DOT determines is capable of posing an unreasonable risk to health, safety and property when transported in commerce. DOT designates nine classes of hazardous material as listed in Table 1: Table 1. DOT Hazard Class Table Hazard Class 1: Explosives 1.1 Mass explosion hazard 1.2 Projectile hazard 1.3 Minor blast/projectile/fire 1.4 Minor blast 1.5 Insensitive explosives 1.6 Very insensitive explosives Hazard Class 2: Gases 2.1 Flammable gases 2.2 Non -flammable compressed gases 2.3 Poisonous gases Hazard Class 3: Flammable Liquid and combustible Liquid Flammable (flash point below 141\u00b0F) Combustible (flash point 141\u00b0 -200\u00b0F) Hazard Class 4: Flammable Solid, Spontaneously Combustible, and Dangerous When Wet 4.1 Flammable solids 4.2 Spontaneously combustible 4.3 Dangerous when wet Hazard Class 5: Oxidizers and Organic Peroxides 5.1 Oxidizer 5.2 Organic Peroxide Hazard Class 6 : Poison (Toxic) and Infectious Materials 6.1 Material that is poisonous 6.2 Infectious Substances Hazard Class 7: Radioactive Material Radioactive I Radioactive II Radioactive III Hazard Class 8: Corrosive Material Destruction of the human skin Corrode steel at a rate of 0.25 inches per year Hazard Class 9: Miscellaneous A material that presents a hazard during shipment but does not meet the definition of the other classes (example dry ice) 193 An infectious substance is classified and regulated as a Class 6, Division 6.2 Hazardous Material under the DOT's Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR \u00a7 171 -180). Division 6.2 Materials are defined as any material known or reasonably expected to contain a patho gen, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, or fungi that can cause disease in humans or animals. An infectious substance must conform to all applicable HMR requirements when offered for transportation or transported by air, highway, rail, or water. In the United States, the DOT regulates the commercial transportation of dangerous goods by both air and ground carriers. In addition to Division 6.2 infectious material, laboratorians may also commonly ship Class 9 Miscellaneous material such as dry ice, and Cl ass 3 Flammable or Combustible material such as Ethanol or Methanol when included as refrigerants or preservatives. The HMR are found in Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations, \u00a7 100 - 185 as: 49 CFR Part \u00a7 171 - General information, regulations and definitions 49 CFR part \u00a7 172- Hazardous materials table, special provisions, hazardous material communications, emergency response information and training requirements 49 CFR part \u00a7 173- Shippers general requirements for shipments and packaging 49 CFR P art \u00a7 174 - Carriage by Rail 49 CFR Part \u00a7 175 - Carriage by Aircraft 49 CFR Part \u00a7 176 - Carriage by Vessel 49 CFR Part \u00a7 177 - Carriage by Public Highway 49 CFR Part \u00a7 178 - Specifications for Packaging 49 CFR Part \u00a7 179 - Specifications for Tank Cars 49 CFR Part \u00a7 180 - Continuing Qualification and Maintenance Packaging DOT can issue revisions or updates to the CFR's at any time and regulations may not be revised annually. However they will issue notices and effective dates when changes are made. It is the Shipper's responsibility to stay current and to not rely solely on previously provided training materials. Revisions to the HMR may be found on the DOT/PHMSA website under \"rule making\" available from their website here: http://www.phmsa.dot.gov . A person who knowingly violates a requirement of the Federal hazardous material transportation law is liable for a civil penalty of not more than $50,000 and not less than $250 for each violation, except the maximum c ivil penalty is $100,000 if the violation results in death, serious illness or severe injury to any person or substantial destruction of property. A minimum $450 civil penalty applies to a violation relating to training. When the violation is a continuing one, each day of the violation constitutes a separate offense. Violations of any hazardous materials regulations including training may be subject to a civil penalty of up to $50,000 for each violation. If the violation results in death, serious illness or severe injury to any person or substantial destruction of property, the maximum civil penalty is $100,000. Criminal violations may result in fines, imprisonment or both. See 49 CFR \u00a7 107.329 (maximum penalties) and \u00a7 107.333 for further details. A writ ten Hazardous Material Security Plan must be developed and implemented by facilities meeting the requirements based on the certain types or quantities of hazardous materials that may be present 194 at the facility or offered for transport from the facility. F acilities in possession of Select Biological Agents and Toxins are required to have a written Hazardous Material Security Plan. For a complete listing of the other types and quantities requiring a HazMat Security Plan, as well as related guidance, please materials/how -comply and Fe deral DOT Inspectors may inspect any facility transporting or offering for transport hazardous materials to ensure regulatory compliance, and inspections may be unannounced. The complete DOT Hazardous Material Regulations (HMR) can be found here: http://phmsa.dot.gov/regulations and the DOT Hazardous Material info line for additional assistance is: 1-800- 467- 4922. FAA - FEDERAL AVIATION ADM INISTRATION While the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has t he authority to direct flight operations in United States airspace, any decision to restrict flights between the United States and other countries due to public health and disease concerns would be an interagency decision that would engage the Departments of Health and Human Services/CDC, State, Homeland Security, and Transportation. The FAA enforces the Hazardous Material Regulations in aviation. Passengers violating the HMR can be fined from $250 to $50,000. Those who intentionally violate the regulations are subject to a criminal penalty of up to $500,000 and/or five years imprisonment. The FAA can inspect facilities transporting by air, or offering for transport by air hazardous materials. Typically inspections will be based on records (e.g., Dangerous Goods Shipper's Declarations for Category A Infectious Substances) reviewed at commercial carrier facilities. FAA Regulations can be found here: http ://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/faa_regulations/commercial_space/#guidelines IATA - INTERNATIONAL AIR TR ANSPORT ASSOCIATION The International Air Transport Association (IATA) publishes the IATA's Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR) to provide the proper procedures for shippers to safely transport materials with hazardous properties by air on all U.S. commercial air transport. IATA annually publishes the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations. The IATA requirements contain all of the ICAO Technical Instructions as well as additional restrictive requirements that reflect air transport industry standard practices or operational considerations. The IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations is considered a \"field manual\" version of the ICAO Technical Instructions, written a nd edited by airline dangerous goods experts and is the worldwide standard for air transport. The IATA DGR applies to international shipments as well as all U.S. air transport. By following and conforming to the IATA Dangerous Goods regulations your pack age will also meet U.S. Department of Transportation requirements for ground transport. IATA issues revisions and annual updates to the Dangerous Goods Regulations that become effective January 1 st of each year. Significant changes in IATA regulations are available approximately six 195 months prior to the annual January 1 DGR publication. The IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations can be found here: http://www.iata.org/publications/dgr/Pages/inde x.aspx ICAO - INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATIO N The United Nations (UN) develops a set of International Transportation of Hazardous Materials Model Regulations through an agency called the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). ICAO develops and publishes a guide called the Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air. Based upon these recommendations, the International Air Transport Association, IATA, develops a set of regulations for the correct packaging and shipping of dangerous goods known as the Dangerous Goods Regulations (DGR). ICAO biannually publishes the Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air, which specifies the procedures for shipping hazardous materials via air transportation and is recognized by DOT in 49 CFR \u00a7 171.11. Additional information about ICAO as well as the Technical Instructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air can be found here: www. icao .org/ . OSHA - OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH ASSOCIATI ON It is important to note that while the Occupational Safety and Health Association (OSHA) does not regulate infectious substance shipping, they do designate rules and requirements for the proper labeling (e.g., biohazard symbol) and safe handling of infectious substances. OSHA publishes the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard which can be found in Title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) at 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.1030. The Bloodborne Pathogens Standard requirement s state what employers must do to protect workers who may be occupationally exposed to blood or other potentially infectious material (OPIM), as defined in the standard as a part of their job duties. Current training in the proper safe handling of infecti ous material is necessary for the training requirements to package and ship infectious substances. The OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard can be found here: https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&p_id=10051 TSA - TRANSPORTATION SECUR ITY ADMINISTRATION The U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) was created to strengthen the security of the nation's transportation systems and ensure the freedom of movement for people and commerce. TSA uses a risk -based strategy and works closely with transportation, law enforcement and intelligence communities to set the standard for excellence in transportation security. Addition al information about the TSA can be found here: http://www.tsa.gov/ . USPS - UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE The United States Postal Service (USPS) publishes its own set of regulations known as the USPS Domestic Mail Manual (DMM). The USPS DMM provides regulations and requirements for mailing hazardous materials through the U.S. Postal System to align with DOT Hazard Material Regulations 196 (HMR). The Domestic Mail Manual can be found here: http://pe.usps.gov/text/dmm300/dmm300_landing.htm . COMMERCIAL CARRIER A ND COURIER SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS Commercial carriers such as FedEx, UPS, Airborne Express, World Courier, DHL, etc., are not regulatory agencies, but as carriers they may inspect packages, reject shipments, alert proper regulatory agencies of deficiencies, and develop their own requirements and restrictions in addition to the applicable Federal and International regulations. Be sure to follow any carrier or courier specific requirements and consult with their respective customer support services for assistance. INSPECTIONS DOT and FAA b oth have authority to perform unannounced inspections of facilities that ship dangerous goods or hazardous materials. Inspections of these facilities are to ensure compliance with the current regulations and to perform an on- site inspection of any hazardo us material present, and a review of any related procedures. Facilities which do not comply with prescribed regulations are subject to substantial fines. Inspectors visiting your facility may ask to view your packaging and shipping area and supplies, trai ning records, Hazardous Material Security Plans, shipping records and related procedures, infectious waste and other hazardous material supplies or storage that may be present. TRAINING AND CERTIFI CATION Personnel involved with the packaging or shipping of Division 6.2 material are considered hazmat employees according to DOT and must be properly and currently trained. A hazmat employee is anyone who affects the transport of hazardous materials in commerce. All hazmat employees must be trained and most must be certified. Individuals who may perform duties related to packaging and shipping of Division 6.2 Materials must receive initial training within ninety (90) days of the start of their employment, and then recurrent training in order to stay current a nd within compliance. Division 6.2 Materials training is the employer's responsibility and must include the following training components: General Awareness/Familiarization Function -specific Safety Security Awareness training NOTE : If a facility possesses Select Agents or other specific quantities or types of listed hazardous material according to DOT, training must also include In -Depth Security training. Additional information about In -Depth Security training and for a list of materials besides select a gent that require a facility specific Hazmat Security Plan can be found here: http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHM SA/DownloadableFiles/Hazmat/Hazmat%20Training/Enha nced%20Security%20Brochure.pdf 197 The employer is responsible for identifying which employees need training, and an individual requires training if their employer asks them to do any or all of the following t asks listed below. Because your employer decides what tasks you will be asked to perform, they will ensure you are properly trained to carry out those tasks. You are considered a hazmat employee if your employer asks you to carry out any or all of the foll owing tasks: Prepare a shipping paper (e.g. a shipper's declaration form, air waybills) Sign a shipper's declaration form Classify Division 6.2 materials Select packaging for Division 6.2 materials Pack hazardous materials for transport Label or mark a package that contains hazardous materials Transport hazardous materials in commerce Provide or maintain emergency response information Training is required whether you perform one or all of the functions listed above. The frequency of required training as well as the depth of training may vary, depending upon your work assignments. DOT regulations require that individuals who package and ship Division 6.2 materials be certified by their employer. Certification indicates that the employer assures that each certified individual has been trained in a manner that is consistent with the job responsibilities assigned related to packaging and shipping laboratory materials. 198 REQUIRED TRAININGS INITIAL TRAINING A new hazmat employee who changes job functions ma y perform those functions prior to completion of training, provided the employee performs those functions under the direct supervision of a properly trained and knowledgeable hazmat employee; and the training is completed within 90 days after employment or job function change. RECURRENT TRAINING Employees must receive the required refresher training before expiration date, or any time there is a change in job function. IATA requires recurrent training every two years, and DOT, CAP, Joint Commission every three years. Interim training may need to occur due to changes in job responsibilities, changes in regulations, or changes in laboratory needs (i.e. the laboratory obtains select agent registration approval). Since regulations and requirements are updated often, most employers tend to follow the stricter two year recurrent training schedule in order to maintain current awareness. It is important to always follow your facility's internal policy for training frequencies. For additional information, please v isit: The employer of a facility offering hazardous material for transport is responsible for developing a training policy or program for Hazardous Materials training. The training may be developed and provided in -house, or the employer may choose to seek an externally provided training from a reputable and reliable source to satisfy the training requirements. The training must take into account and cover the following: Bloodborne Pathogens Hazardous Materials General security training Conduct facility specific security training (e.g., if the laboratory possesses Select Agents) Identify hazmat employees requiring training Determine the functions and responsibilities of each employee with regard to h azardous materials Train all employees within 90 days of employment Provide recurring training as needed o Every two years (IATA) 2 o Every 3 years (DOT, Joint Commission and CAP)3 2 International Air Trans port Association 3 College of American Pathologists 199 o Change in job responsibilities o Changes in regulations o Changes in laboratory needs (e.g. Laboratory seeks to obtain Select Agent approval) Test and document employee competence, as needed Certify that employee training is consistent with function and responsibilities Maintain records of certification GENERAL AWARENESS AND FAMILI ARIZATION TRAINING General awareness and familiarization training is intended to raise the hazmat employees' awareness of the HMR, DGR, OSHA Bloodborne Pathogens Standard, and any applicable commercial carrier or courier specific requirements, and serve the purpose and meaning of the hazard communication requirements. All hazmat employees must have General Awareness and Familiarization training. Identification and classification of hazardous materials must also be covered. General awareness and familiarization training may be obtained from DOT as a HazMat General Awareness/Familiarization Training CD, or from the CDC following links: DOT: https://hazmatonline .phmsa.dot.gov/services/Pub_Free.aspx CDC: http://www.cdc.gov/labtraining/ FUNCTION- SPECIFIC TRAINING Function specific training is intended to teach the necessary knowledge, skills and abilities for an individual's job function. It is required to include guidance on classification of specimens/isolates, information on how to package, mark, and label them, and instructions regarding documentation and emergency response information of Division 6.2 Material s. The training must also include information regarding regulations of special permits, if applicable. Division 6.2 Materials Function- specific training may be obtained from CDC at the following link: http: //www.cdc.gov/labtraining/ . Depending on the laboratory area where the employee works and the associated job functions, the individual may require other types of Function- Specific training. This may include \"Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Training\" for certain environmental laboratorians (http://www.epa.gov/osw/education/train.htm ), or Global Safety Training, with additional information available at: https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/global.html . 200 SAFETY TRAINING Safety training needs to provide information concerning the potential hazards posed by materials in the workplace and personal protection measures. The training may include basic emergency response procedures but is not intended to satisfy the requirements of 29 CFR \u00a7 1910.120 (Bloodborne Pathogens Standard). Appropriate safety training must include information on how to safely handle Division 6.2 Ma terials, must include OSHA Bloodborne Pathogen training, and must meet any other applicable employee safety and emergency response training requirements. \"Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control for Healthcare Facilities\" training may be found at : https://www.osha.gov/dte/edcenters/course_description.html (Course #7200). SECURITY AWARENESS T RAINING Each hazmat employee must receive security awareness training. This training must inc lude an awareness of security risks associated with hazardous materials transportation and methods designed to enhance transportation security. New hazmat employees must receive this training within 90 days of employment. This training can be acquired by employer -provided training or by completing the \"HazMat Transportation Security Awareness Training Module (HazMat DigiPack 7.2 CD)\" located at: https://hazmatonline.phmsa.dot.gov/serv ices/Pub_Free.aspx IN-DEPTH SECURITY TRAIN ING In addition to the above Security Awareness training, hazmat employees of employers that are required to have a Hazmat Security plan must receive in- depth security training on the facility specific security pl an and its implementation. The training must be provided by employers to employees working in entities possessing select agents as well as additionally listed hazardous materials. This training can be developed internally by referencing the following \"Enhanced Security Brochure\" link below. Additional information about in -depth security requirements including a list of materials other than select agents requiring a facility specific Hazmat Security Plan can be found here: http://www.phmsa.dot.gov/staticfiles/PHMSA/DownloadableFiles/Hazmat/Hazmat%20Trainin g/Enhanced%20Security%20Brochure.pdf Copies of the brochure can be obtained from: o https://hazmatonline.phmsa.dot.gov/services/Pub_Free.aspx 201 TRAINING DOCUMENTATI ON A hazmat employer must create and maintain training records for each hazmat emp loyee. Training records must be inclusive of the preceding three years and kept for as long as the hazmat employee is employed and for 90 days thereafter. The training record must include: The hazmat employee's name; The most recent training completion d ate of the hazmat employee's training; A description, copy or the location of the training materials used to meet the requirements; The name and address of the person providing training; and Certification that the hazmat employee has been trained and tested as required by this subpart. The records required to be maintained by the employer must be produced upon reasonable demand by an authorized employee of DOT or FAA. Records may be in any format such as paper or electronic files as long as they contain the required information and are readily available. Compliance with the current requirements for a CDL with a tank vehicle or hazardous materials endorsement provides a driver with the general knowledge and skills necessary to safely operate a commercial motor vehicle with hazardous materi als cargo. This may satisfy the hazardous materials training requirements. As a hazmat employee, additional specialized training may be required based on the job function and material -specific requirements related to the handling of hazardous materials. The hazmat employer must determine the extent to which the CDL endorsement satisfies all training requirements. For additional information, The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in part nership with the National Laboratory Training Network (NLTN) offers a free, online eLearning shipping training course for Division 6.2 Infectious Substances. Participants in the course will first need to have an account with CDC TRAIN. Registration is free and the site is: CDC TRAIN www.cdc.gov/labtraining . Once an account has been setup, locate the course from their catalog and register.

Always be sure to consult with your State or Local Public Health Laboratories or LRN Reference Laboratory for any offered trainings, or for guidance and questions. 203 TRANSPORT CLASSIFICATION Shipping of all hazardous material or dangerous goods begins with the classification of the substance(s). Classification serves two purposes, first it allows the shipper to select the proper packing instructions (PI) to observe and follow, and second, it provides important information necessary to complete the appropriate documentation, such as a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods which must accompany all shipments of Category A substances. Shippers must not arbitrarily classify all substances as Category B Biological Substance, or even Exempt Substances to avoid having to make important d iscriminatory shipping decisions or to make packaging easier or less expensive. Such classification is illegal, is subject to violations, and can be overly expensive. Similarly, classifying all substances as Category A when they may not be would also be in appropriate, and considerably more expensive. The first step of classification is to determine whether the substance being classified is a specimen or culture . \"Patient Specimens \" are defined as material collected directly from humans or animals for diagn ostic, treatment, prevention, investigational, or research purposes 4. According to DOT, Patient Specimen includes excreta, secreta, blood and its components, tissue and tissue swabs, body parts, and specimens in transport media (e.g., transwabs, culture m edia, and blood culture bottles). However, if transport media is incubated prior to transport and demonstrates propagated growth or turbidity, it is no longer considered a patient specimen and would need to be classified as a culture. \"Culture\" is defined as an infectious substance containing a pathogen that is intentionally propagated. The second step of classification is determining whether the substance meets the definition of Category A, Category B, Exempt Specimen, or Non- Regulated. Further details and definitions are found in the specific categories and in the guidance tables below, but in general: Non -Regulated and Exempt Substances: Not subject to Division 6.2 DOT regulations. Examples include patient specimens from otherwise healthy individuals when shipped by DOT couriers, usually being tested for routine, non- infectious tests. Exempt patient specimen for which there is no, to only a minimal likelihood that pathogens are present when shipped according to IATA and the U.S. Postal Service. Categor y B, Biological Substances: An infectious substance not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability, or life -threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs. This includes Category B infectiou s substances transported for diagnostic or investigational purposes. 4 International Air Transport Association. 2012. Dangerous Goods Regulations, 53rd ed. Montreal, Canada: International Air Transport Association. 204 Category A, Infectious Substances: An infectious substance in a form capable of causing permanent disability, or life -threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs.5\" The third step of classification is determining who is transporting the material, whether it is an air or ground carrier, or a DOT packaging exception known as Materials of Trade. Each will be described further below. 5 International Air Transport Association. 2012. Dangerous Goods Regulations, 53rd ed. Montreal, Canada: International Air Transport Association. 205 DIAGRAM 1 .

A Category A in dicative list has been included within this guidance below as Table 2 . The list is subject to change, has changed periodically and not considered to be all inclusive . Please note that at times, the names of new and emerging pathogens may not always be incl uded and published immediately on regulatory lists. Consult the most recent edition of the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations that are published annually for updates and revisions. New and emerging pathogens that may not appear on the current Category A Ind icative List but that may possibly meet the same Category A criteria must be assigned to Infectious Substance, Category A, or Suspected Category A. New and emerging pathogens meeting the inclusion Category A criteria, or organisms closely resembling the cr iteria of microorganisms on this list (e.g., Select Agents), and microorganisms for which there may be a professional doubt concerning pathogenic criteria should also be considered for inclusion and classified as a Category A microorganisms, or a Suspected Category A. The list of Select Biological Agents and Toxins very closely resembles the Category A list of organisms, although the overlap is not identical. Sample classification for inclusion as a Category A shipment should take into account the organism s on the Health and Human Services (HHS) / U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent list. Confirmed select agents must always be shipped as Category A, and potential or suspect select agents as \"Suspected Category A\". The Select Biological Agent and Toxin list can be found here http://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsList.html . Always refer to public health authorities (e.g., CDC, WHO, or other state or local publi c health agencies) for guidance when transporting a new or emerging pathogen or when there is a transporting concern.

This list is su bject to change and has changed periodically. Please note that at times, the names of new and emerging pathogens may not always be included and published immediately on regulatory lists. Shippers should also consult the HHS/USDA Select Biological Agents an d Toxins list available at www.selectagents.gov for the shipment of any potential select agent organism or toxin. Confirmed Select Agents must always be shipped as Category A, and potential or suspect Select Age nts as \"Suspected Category A\". Always refer to public health authorities (e.g., CDC, WHO, or other state or local public health agencies) for guidance when transporting a new or emerging pathogen. To complete the entire classification process, follow the included classification charts above such as the DOT Transport of Infectious Substances Safely (DOT PHH50 -0079- 0706)7 and the IATA/USPS Guidance Flowcharts in Diagrams 1 and 2. Answer questions within the chart(s) with a \"yes\" or \"no\" to aid in your sample classification. Multiple questions grouped together may require all be answered as \"yes\" or \"no\", or may be marked as \"yes to any.\" Note, the IATA/USPS and the DOT charts are similar except for an additional category labeled \"Exempt\", which will be described later in this section. SUMMARY To summarize the classification process, the key points are to observe regulation specifics according to mode of transport (air vs. ground); determine if transporting a culture or specimen; consider the use 7 DOT Transport of Infectious Substances Safely (DOT PHH50 -0079- 0706); https://hazmatonline.phmsa.dot.gov/services/publication_documents/Transporting%20Infectious%2 0Substances%20Safely.pdf 210 of additional refrigerants or preservatives used to maintain the culture or specimen; and use professional judgment if known medical history and local endemic circumstances plays a role in classifying the substance or supersedes the flowcharts. Additional requirement s, such as the CDC Guidelines for Rapid Toxic Screen, may rule normally exempt specimens as Biological Substances, Category B UN3373. Refer to the CDC Laboratory Response Network for Chemical Terrorism Threat Response (LRN -C) http://www.emergency.cdc.gov/lrn/chemical.asp for additional information before shipping blood or urine from a potentially exposed person. TRIPLE PACKAGING OVE RVIEW Commercially manufactured shipping containers and materia ls should be used to contain biological and infectious agents whether sending by private or commercial shipper, U.S. Postal Service, or ground courier. Category A shipping containers are required to meet UN and IATA certification specifications for transpo rt of hazardous materials and be clearly marked. It is important to use the containers as they are received from the manufacturer, follow the included instructions for use and to not mix or match individual components. After determining the exact nature and category of the substance to be shipped, the shipper must select the most appropriate Packing Instruction (PI) and packing directions to use. See Table 3 for a comparison of the details of packing instructions and directions. 211 TABLE 3 .

An overview of triple packaging consists of: INNER PRIMARY CONTAI NERS A ND MATERIALS A primary container must be a leak proof (for liquid material) or sift proof (for solid material) receptacle. Liquids transported by air should have an appropriate air space inside receptacle. Primary containers may be glass, metal or plastic, but must be leak proof and sealed. Absorbent material sufficient to absorb all liquid or solid hazardous contents contained within the primary container(s) in case of breakage; must be placed between the primary and secondary containers. INNER SECONDA RY CONTAINERS AND MA TERIALS A leak or sift proof secondary container which contains the primary container(s) and absorbent material, such as a zip -lock style specimen transport bag containing a biohazard symbol. Secondary containers can be rigid or flexible, must be of adequate size to hold the primary receptacle, and contain absorbent material and cushioning (required if multiple or fragile primary receptacles). An itemized list of the contents and quantities of the primary container(s) must be att ached to or included on the outside of the secondary container and not within. OSHA requires the biohazard symbol to be affixed to primary or secondary receptacles. The itemized list of content requirement may be satisfied with a laboratory sample submissi on or test request form if the total type and quantity of hazardous material is listed. OUTER/TERTIARY CONTAINERS AND MATERIALS Rigid and durable outer package of adequate strength for its inten ded use and constructed of cardboard, wood, or material of equivalent strength. If shipping a Category A material, the outer package must bear the UN packaging certification symbol. Outer surface must be of adequate size to place all required markings an d labels on one side. Labels should measure at least 4\" x 4\" unless transporting by IATA and package is too small for standard size label. At least one surface must have a minimum dimension of 100 mm by 100 mm (3.9 x 3.9 inches). Orientation labels (up arrows) must be placed on opposite sides of all packages which contain >50 mL of a liquid or frozen liquid infectious substance to indicate the correct orientation of the package. 8 Packaging Requirements CFR \u00a7173. 196(b) United Nations (UN) Packagi ng Certification Symbol Example 213 If a Category A substance is shipped, a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods must also be included on the outside of the package. Outer packaging must be marked with the following: o Proper Shipping name and UN identification number For Category B Shipments: UN3373 Biological Substance, Category B For Category A, and Suspect Category A Shipments: Category 6 Hazard Label UN2814 Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans ( technical name of organism ) UN2900 Infectious Substance, Affecting Animals ( technical name of organism ) If Suspect Category A, technical name will be listed as \"Su spect Category A\" Note : Special Provision A140 allows the technical name of the organism to be omitted from being displayed on the outer packaging after the proper shipping name; however the technical name of the organism must still be listed after the pr oper shipping name on the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form. o Total quantity of included hazardous material o Shipper's name, address and contact information o Recipient's name, address and contact information o Responsible Person's name and contact information Note : May be either the shipper or recipient as long as the listed person is knowledgeable of the contents. If listing recipient as the Responsible Person, ensure prior acknowledgement before transport. o 24 hour emergency name and contact inf ormation Note : Must be a live person able to answer a call entire time package is in transport NOTE : Reuse of manufacturer's packaging is permitted if it is cleaned and disinfected. Do not reuse if the package is damaged, contaminated in any way, or if unable to be labeled and marked properly. Guidance checklists for Category A, Category B, Dry Ice, Overpack, and Shipper's Declarations are contained at the end of this section and describe the requirements of each shipment type in further detail. Informat ion about obtaining appropriate supplies is also contained further below in the Supplies Section. The following is an overview of the packaging types for Exempt Specimens, Category B, Category A, and miscellaneous categories. 214 EXEMPT SPECIMENS9 Specimens which have a minimal likelihood that pathogens may be present are classified as \"Exempt\" if transported by an IATA courier or USPS. IATA requires outer packages to be clearly marked as \"Exempt Human Specimen\" or \"Exempt Animal Specimen\" when meeting the classification criteria for exempt specimens. However, DOT does not require this marking on the outer package for shipments meeting these criteria. Exempt specimens can be substances which have been treated by decontamination, neutralization, or inactivat ion so that the pathogen(s) potentially present no longer poses a health risk and are not subject to the HMR unless they meet the criteria for inclusion in another hazard class. Examples of Exempt Specimens are as follows: Blood or urine testing as part o f routine medical exam or to monitor levels of: o Cholesterol o Blood Glucose o Hormones o Prostate specific antibodies (PSA) Blood or urine to monitor liver or kidney functions, as long as they are not known to contain a pathogen Tests conducted for insurance o r employment, or intended to determine the presence of alcohol or drugs DNA Testing Specimens for testing other than for the presence of pathogens o Biopsies for cancer o Antibody titers 9 Reference 346.12d 215 DIAGRAM 3 .

EXEMPT SPECIMEN WITH DRY ICE OUTER PACKAG E EXAMPLE 217 DIAGRAM 6 . EXEMPT HUMAN SPECIME N LABEL EXAMPLE Exempt specimens must be triple -packaged in leak proof (for liquids) or sift proof (solids) primary receptacles when shipped by air. Sufficient cushioning and absorbent materials are required around each primary container. Primary and secondary packaging must be enclosed in a rigid outer shipping container (Styrofoam alone is not accep table). The primary receptacle must not contain more than 500 mL/g. Secondary containers must be marked with the international biohazard symbol and enclosed in a fiberboard box or container of equivalent strength. For air transport, the outer container m ust be marked on the address side with the words \"Exempt Human Specimen\" or \"Exempt Animal Specimen\". At least one surface must have a minimum dimension of 100 mm by 100 mm (3.9 x 3.9 inches). CATEGORY B BIOLOGICA L SUBSTANCES The definition of a Categor y B Biological Substance is an infectious substance not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life -threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure occurs. This group includes Category B infectious substances transported for diagnostic or investigational purposes. The strict UN specifications and certification symbol marking for the package testing does not apply when shipping Category B substances. Outer boxes used to ship Category B substances need only to be rigid and strong enough for their intended purpose and be certified to pass a 1.2 meter = 3.9 foot drop test. 10 At least one surface must have a minimum dimension of 100 mm by 100 mm (3.9 x 3.9 inches). The minimum standards for the proper way to prepare, package, and label Category B substances for their safe and proper transport are found in Packaging Instructions (PI) 650. A Category B guidance checklist is contained at the end of this section listing the individual requirements for primary , secondary and outer/tertiary packaging. 10 International Air Transport Association. 2012.

BIOLOGICAL SUBSTANCE , CATEGORY B WITH DR Y ICE OUTER PACKAGE EXAMPLE CATEGORY A INFECTIOU S SUBSTANCES The definition of a Category A infectious substance (pathogen or agent) is an infectious substance which is transported in a form that, if when exposure to it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability or life -threatening or fatal disease to otherwise healthy humans or animals 11. Classification must be based on the known medical history or symptoms of the source patient or animal, endemic local conditions, and professional judgment concerning the individual circumstances of the source human or animal as well as specific and known characteristics of the included infectious material. 11 International Air Transport Association. 2012. Dangerous Goods Regulations, 53rd ed. Montreal, Canada: International Air Transport Association. 220 If the specimen or material (e.g., culture) meets the definition of a Category A substance, or is on the Category A Indicative List (Table 2), it must be packaged and shipped accordingly. Infectious substances that are considered Category A in \"culture\" form only are noted in the guidance document Table 2 . If there is a potential that a substance may meet the criteria of Category A (e.g., specimen sent following the American Society of Microbiology (ASM) Sentinel Laboratory LRN Rule Out or Refer protocol), it must be classified as Category A Infectious Substance, or \"Suspected Category A.\" Category A substances likely to contain a Category A pathogen must be assigned to the UN number(s) UN2814, Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans, UN2900, Infectious Substance, Affecting Animals , or Suspected Category A (either UN2814 or UN2900). If a Category A pathogen/substance is capable of causing disease in both humans and animals, the pathogen/substance must be classified and shipped as a Category A substance affecting humans, UN2814. Cate gory A pathogens affecting animals ONLY and NOT humans must be classified as UN2900. The minimum standards for the correct way to prepare, package, and label Category A infectious substances for safe and proper transport are found in Packaging Instructio ns (PI) 620. Category A packages must display the UN certification marking indicating that the packaging unit has passed specific testing requirements. At least one surface must have a minimum dimension of 100 mm by 100 mm (3.9 x 3.9 inches). A Category A guidance checklist is contained at the end of this section listing the individual requirements for primary, secondary and outer/tertiary packaging. 221 DIAGRAM 11 .

UN CERTIFICATION MARKINGS SUSPECT CATEGORY A When an infectious substance to be shipped is unknown, but suspected or has the potential of meeting the criteria for inclusion in Category A and assignment to either UN2814 or UN2900, the technical name \"Suspected Category A Infectious Substance\" should be used shown in parenthesis, following the proper shipping name on the Shipper's Declaration. Specific examples when this classification and wording should be used include pathogens that cannot be ruled out after following the American Society for Microb iology (ASM) LRN Sentinel Laboratory guidelines and must be referred to the State or Local LRN Reference Laboratory. SELECT BIOLOGICAL AG ENTS AND TOXINS Some Category A pathogens or biological toxins have been deemed by the U.S. government to be major t hreats to the public and designated as potential agents of bioterrorism, or threat agents. These organisms and toxins are known as Select Biological Agents and Toxins and are listed on the National Select Agent Registry website which can be found here: http://www.selectagents.gov/ . NOTE : United States federal regulations require shippers to have special permits and registration to possess, use, transfer, and receive these agents12. The Federal Select Agent Program has amended the select agent regulations so regulated entities that maintain shipping and receiving facilities in compliance with DOT hazardous substance regulations, and have procedures that are able to maintain select agent and toxin anonymity in ship ping/receiving facilities, i.e., preserving \"lost in the crowd\", will not be required to register these areas even if 12 Department of Health and Human Services. Possession, use, and transfer of select agents and toxins; 42 CFR Part 73. Federal Register. 2008; 73:61363- 61366. 4GV/X 20/S/05 USA/0000 United Nations Symbol Packaging Code Performance Level Gross Mass in Kilograms Solids Year of Manufacture Country of Authorization Manufacturer Identification 225 packages not identified as containing select agent or toxin will temporarily be stored in these areas. For entities preserving the \"lost i n the crowd\" concept during shipping and receiving, the select agent regulatory oversight for recipients begins when a select agent package arrives at its ultimate destination. Confirmed select agents must always be sent as Category A, and the designation of \"Suspected Category A\" may no longer be used. Please note that the organisms on the Select Biological Agent and Toxin list, and the Category A list of organisms are extremely similar, but do not overlap identically, see the Category A List vs. Select Agent List Comparison job aid at the end of this section for further details. Always be sure to consult both lists when making the sample classification determination and consult with your Local or State Public Health Laboratory, or LRN Reference Laboratory for guidance. RISK GROUP 4 (RG4) A GENTS The World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Biological Safety Association (ABSA) defines Risk Group 4 as a pathogen that is likely to cause serious or lethal human disease for wh ich preventive or therapeutic interventions are not usually available. Therefore, there is a high individual risk and high community risk. RG4 organisms, such as Ebola virus, may have additional restrictions when shipping. Always be sure to consult with the anticipated transporter prior to shipping any potential RG4 material. MISCELLANEOUS CATEGO RIES Genetically modified organisms and microorganisms (GMO, and GMMO's), biological products, medical waste, and infected animals each require proper shipping names, UN identification codes, and have defined regulations beyond the scope of this guidance document. Refer to the DOT guidelines for these classifications and for further information. REFRIGERANTS AND PRE SERVATIVES Refrigerants and preservatives are co mmonly utilized and included when shipping Division 6.2 materials. Refrigerants such as frozen or wet ice (e.g., frozen gel packs), and dry ice are routinely included to maintain specimen temperature and integrity during transport. If frozen, wet ice, or dry ice is used, the shipper needs to ensure to include sufficient absorbent material to absorb any extra moisture that may result from melting or sublimation (for dry ice) during transport. Adding sufficient absorbent material around the refrigerant wil l also help ensure the integrity of the cushioning or the packaging container structure in the event of excess moisture. Shippers should always keep in mind that refrigerants are used to maintain an internal temperature during transport, and not to bring t he sample/material to the desired temperature during transport. Therefore, shippers should always have the samples/material maintained at the needed temperature prior to placement in the shipping container and the addition of refrigerant material. If a shipment contains dry ice, the outer package needs to be marked as such. The appropriate external labeling for dry ice is: 226 Class 9 miscellaneous hazard label UN1845 hazard identification label Quantity of included dry ice (i.e., 4.5kg) If dry ice is includ ed with a Category A shipment, the dry ice must be listed on the required Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form. If dry ice is included in a Category B shipment, an Exempt Specimen shipment, or shipped alone, it will only need to be marked on the outside of the package as described above. Since a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form is not required for Category B shipments, Exempt Specimen shipments, or when dry ice is shipped on its own, dry ice would not need to be listed on the Shipper's Declaration form that would not need to accompany those shipments. A dry ice guidance checklist is contained at the end of this section for assistance. DIAGRAM 17 . DRY ICE LABEL CHANGE NOTICE Effective October, 2014, the Category A Hazard Label (pict ured) has been revised to omit the emergency response telephone number. The required and updated Category A label will not have a phone number within. 227 DIAGRAM 18 . DRY ICE LABEL EXAMPLE DIAGRAM 19 . OVERPACK LABEL EXAMP LE FORMALIN, FORMALDEHYDE, ETHANO L AND METHANOL Alcohols such as ethanol or methanol are commonly added as a preservative or stabilizer in many laboratory samples (i.e., parasitology specimens, cancer biopsies, etc.) and may be ingredients if formaldehyde or formalin i s used. These types of samples may contain regulated Class 3 Flammable Solutions or Class 9 Miscellaneous Hazards depending on the concentrations and mixtures. Formalin is specifically defined as a 37% aqueous solution of formaldehyde. A 10% formalin so lution and a 10% formaldehyde solution are NOT the same materials for transport purposes. 25% Formalin solutions have approximately 10% Formaldehyde and would be classified as \"UN3334, Aviation regulated liquid, n.o.s. (formaldehyde), Class 9\" for transportation by air. 228 There are four different classification options for formaldehyde solutions: 1. If more than 25% of the solution is formaldehyde, it is assigned to UN 2209 Formaldehyde solution 2. If there is 10% to 25% formaldehyde in the solution, it is assigned to UN 3334 Aviation regulated liquid, n.o.s. , Class 9 3. If there is less than 10% formaldehyde in the solution and the solution also contains an alcohol, it is assigned to UN 1198 Formaldehyde solution, flammable 4. If there is less than 10% formaldehyde i n the solution and there is no alcohol in the solution, the transport regulations do not consider it a dangerous good and therefore it is not subject to the regulations Formaldehyde solutions of less than 10% are not considered hazardous materials; concent rations above this amount are subject to specific requirements not covered at length in this guidance. There are no quantity limits for shipment of solutions of less than 10% formaldehyde. The Hazardous Material Table in 49 CFR \u00a7 172.101 provides two ent ries for formaldehyde: 1. Formaldehyde solutions, flammable, UN1198; 2. and Formaldehyde solutions, with not less than 25% Formaldehyde, UN2209 These entries imply that formaldehyde solutions, which are not flammable or have less than 25% formaldehyde, are not regulated, but 10 -24.9% require regulation as a Hazard Class 9 material when shipped by air. Shipments of 10 -24.9% formaldehyde solutions shipped by highway only do not require classification as a hazardous material. 10% Formalin solutions contain 3 -4% Formaldehyde and are not regulated for transport by air or highway. ''Formaldehyde solutions, flammable, UN1198'' is intended for use as a hazardous materials description for formalin. Formaldehyde solutions are generally assigned to UN 2209 under the classification \"Dangerous Goods, Class 8.\" The only solutions required to be shipped according to the requirements of UN 2209 are those which contain more than 25% formaldehyde. When the percentage of formaldehyde in the solution is below 10%, there are tw o classification options. The difference between these options depends on the presence of alcohol in the solution 1. If there is no alcohol in the less than 10% formaldehyde solution, it is not considered dangerous and therefore is not subject to the transport regulations. 2. However, many solutions with less than 10% formaldehyde use an alcohol to stabilize the mixture. Some common alcohols used in these solutions are methyl alcohol or methanol. Any quantity of alcohol changes the classification of the solution . The classification of a solution with less than 10% formaldehyde and with any quantity of an alcohol is a Class 3 Flammable Liquid with a Class 8 Corrosive subsidiary risk, and is assigned to UN 1198 with the proper shipping name Formaldehyde solution, flammable. A formaldehyde solution, with less than 25% but not less than 10% formaldehyde is a Class 9 material. Tissues and specimens being shipped in formalin solutions are not considered to be Diagnostic Specimens or infectious substances unless there i s a high probability that an infectious substance is present. 229 There are regulatory exemptions for some Division 6.2 material with preservatives that should be consulted for applicability: 1. 49 CFR \u00a7 173.4, Small quantities for highway rail 2. 49 CFR \u00a7 173. 4a 4. 49 CFR \u00a7 173.6 Materials of Trade If there are any questions or concerns regarding the composition, always refer to the package insert, or to the Safety Data Sheet (SDS) for consultation. MATERIALS OF TRADE Certain hazardous materials transported in small quantities as part of a business are subject to less regulation, because of the limited hazard they pose. These materials are known as Materials of Trade (MOT) according to DOT . The MOT cl assification applies only to patient specimens that are classified as category B, and do NOT apply to any culture with propagated growth. Category A specimen(s) or culture(s) cannot be shipped using the Materials of Trade classification. Materials of Tra de means a hazardous material, other than a hazardous waste, that is carried on a motor vehicle; (1) For the purpose of protecting the health and safety of the motor vehicle operator or passengers; (2) For the purpose of supporting the operation of a motor vehicle (including its auxiliary equipment) or; (3) By a private motor carrier (including vehicles operated by a rail carrier) in direct support of a principal business other than transportation by a motor vehicle. In order to ship a sample as MOT, the i nner packaging (primary container) must be leak proof for liquids, sift proof for solids and securely closed, secured against shifting and protected against damage. Outer packaging must be strong and include labeling for either the proper shipping name or the common name (i.e., blood, human or clinical specimen). Affix the biohazard label either on inner or outer packaging. Materials of trade can only be transported by motor vehicle, as long as the business is not transportation, such as taxi service, bus or contracted couriers. An example of the correct courier might be a lab- employed courier. Please be aware that it is the responsibility of the shipper to know if the material being transported applies to the HMR requirements. The regulations that apply t o MOTs are found in 49 CFR \u00a7 173.6 and they include: General knowledge of MOTs regulations; Quantity limitations; Packaging requirements; and Marking and labeling requirements. 230 The MOTs regulations do not require: Shipping papers; Emergency response info rmation; Placarding; or Formal training or retention of training records. The transportation of Materials of Trade items (see 49 CFR \u00a7 171.8) by highway may be excepted from many of the requirements of the Hazardous Materials Regulations when transported i n accordance with the procedures contained in 49 CFR FOR DANGEROUS GOOD S OVERVIEW A Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form is required for both air and ground transport of all Categ ory A infectious substances. It is a legal contract between the shipper and carrier, and is required to document the shipment of Category A infectious substances. The form must be accurate, legible, completed and signed. If any of these conditions are not met, even to the slightest degree, the carrier has the right to reject and return the package for transport, and the shipper may be subject to fines or other violations. Certain carriers (e.g., FedEx) require the Shipper's Declaration to be prepared by us ing FedEx proprietary online software or software they approve; some require the information to be completed online; and some require multiple copies be submitted. The original Shipper's Declarations given to the carrier must have slanted red candy stripes along the left and right edges of the document. Checklists can also be found on the IATA or carrier websites to use as another method to assess completed forms. Shippers must retain copies of Shipper's Declarations for at least two years and at least thre e years for any shipments involving select agents. If dry ice is used as a refrigerant within a Category A shipment, the dry ice must be listed on the included Dangerous Goods Shipper's Declaration form as a Class 9 Miscellaneous Dangerous Good. If dry ic e is included within a Category B shipment, a Dangerous Goods Shipper's Declaration form is not necessary to accompany the shipment, and therefore dry ice would not need to be listed on the form that is not required. However, packages containing dry ice mu st still be packaged according to Packing Instruction (PI) 954, and displaying the appropriate miscellaneous hazard labels whenever included. 231 DIAGRAM 20 . FEDEX SHIPPER'S DECL ARATION FOR IATA SHIPPER'S DANGE ROUS GOODS DECLA RATION FORM (FOR ALL AIR TRANSPORT): Specific form with slanted red hatching (candy stripes) along left and right edges of document. FedEx requires use of compliance checking software such as FedEx Ship Manager Software or FedEx approved software when generating a shipper's declaration to accompany a shipment they will carry. Consult and use available checklists on IATA or carrier websites to check package for accuracy. Specific items to be listed on the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form i nclude: o Shipper's name and contact information o Recipients name and contact information o Airway bill number o Designation of whether the package can be transported as Passenger and Cargo, or Cargo only by Aircraft o Designation of radioactive vs. non -radioactive contents o UN identification number (e.g., UN2814) o Proper Shipping Name of material [e.g., Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans (technical name of the organism )] o Class or Division (Subsidiary Risk) (e.g., 6.2) o Packing Group (if applicable) o Quantity and type of packaging used (e.g., one fiberboard box) o Packing Instruction (e.g., PI 620) o Authorization (e.g., A81, A140) o Emergency Response contact information o Title and signature Emergency Response Information (ERI), include area code and must be answered by person listed and must be answered entire time package is in transit. If third party provider used, enter phone number with area code, and contractor name as appears on contract, or list contract number. IATA requires individual name for responsible perso n, not a title or company name. Provide 3 signed copies all printed in color or two in color, one in black & white to FedEx courier. o Shippers must retain copies of Shipper's Declarations for at least two years, and if any select agent is shipped, records must be kept for a minimum of three years. COMMON PACKAGING, LA BELING AND MARKING E RRORS INCLUDE: o Technical name of organism as listed on indicative Category A list (Table 2), listed incorrectly. Do not abbreviate or misspell technical names of organisms. o Incorrect packaging description such as \"Styrofoam\" or \"cardboard box\". Do not use acronym only. o Quantity of hazardous material listed incorrectly. 233 DOT SHIPPER'S DANGER OUS GOODS DECLARATION FORM: Motor vehicle (ground) transport does require a shipper's declaration, but DOT does not use a specific type of form, or require it to be in color. Commercial ground transport companies may provide their own declaration or one can be created in column form. Certain basic description informatio n of the hazardous contents must be included in a specific order: UN identification number (e.g., UN2814) Proper shipping name [e.g., Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans (technical name of the organism )] Hazard Class or Division (e.g., 6.2) Packing Grou p if necessary Number and type of packaging (e.g., one fiberboard box) Total quantity of hazardous contents by weight or volume (e.g., 5mL) 24 hour Emergency Response contact information Responsible Person contact information Shipper's certification state ment is required if courier is not an employee of shipper o Must be signed by shipper o Additional forms to be included with DOT's Shipper's Declaration include written emergency information such as Guide 158 or SDS sheet for specific pathogen included. CATE GORY A, PROPER SHIPPING NAME EXAMPLES Below are a few common Category A examples that may be encountered in the laboratory: Shiga toxin producing E. coli O157:H7 (Verotoxigenic) o UN2814, Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans ( Escherichia coli O157:H7) o Or, UN2814, Infectious Escherichia coli verotoxigenic) Mycobacterium (TB) o UN2814, Infectious Affecting Humans ( Mycobacterium tuberculosis) Suspected Anthrax o UN2814, Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans ( Bacillus anthracis ) o Or, UN2814, Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans (Suspected Category A Infectious Substance) Each of these above examples would be associated with Division 6.2, and not have Packing Group associated. Ensure the amount of hazardous mat erial being shipped is also listed as well as the type of outer container material. Note: Special Provision A140 permits the technical name of the organism from being omitted from the outer package labeling, however, the technical name of the organism mu st still be listed on the Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form. 234 COURIERS Safe ground transportation of specimens to and from laboratories is governed by regulation issued by the Department of Transportation (DOT) and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). Shippers MUST be aware of what types of packages the carrier or courier accepts or what is restricted (variations), what liability the courier company possesses and have written agreement before utilizing their services. Courier credentials can be found at http://safer.fmcsa.dot.gov/CompanySnapshot.aspx . Couriers need to have a driver's license appropriate for their job (CDL for commercial couriers) and have a clean driving record. Goo d knowledge of medical terminology and basic medical procedures is helpful. Couriers must be trained in function- specific tasks, safety and security awareness, and be familiar with regulations. Finally, couriers are responsible for knowing what their emergency response obligation is if there is an incident involving packages being transported. PRIVATE COURIERS A private motor carrier transports its own cargo, usually as a part of a business. Therefore, the courier is hired by and on the company payroll. Private couriers may not be subject to the requirements of Division 6.2 if the private vehicle is used only to transport patient specimens or cultures (not Category A), and other medically -related items such as diagnostic test kits or medical documents. Each item must still be appropriately packaged and be protected from exposure. Couriers CANNOT transport other patients, other persons including employees or non- medically related items. See Materials of Trade section for additional and related information. COMMERCIAL COURIERS Motor carriers must have specific insurance and legal process agent documents on file with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA). The required filings vary, based on the product being carried. Most important, the co urier who accepts package(s), MUST recognize what is offered to them as UN3373 Category B Biological Substances, UN2814 Infectious Substances or specimens not regulated by DOT (Exempt); and if the courier company has the authority to accept. They must als o recognize if the package is correctly marked and has proper documentation offered with the package. GOVERNMENT COURIERS During public health emergencies, law enforcement agents or other designated state officials with identification may deliver specimens exempt from the HMR, as found in the 49 CFR \u00a7 171.1 d(5 -6): Applicability of Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR) to persons and functions. Functions are not subject to the requirements of the HMR. The following are examples of activities to which the HMR do not apply: o Transportation of a hazardous material in a motor vehicle, aircraft, or vessel operated by a Federal, state, or local government employee solely for noncommercial Federal, state, or local government purposes. o Transportation of a hazardous material by an individual for non -commercial purposes in a private motor vehicle, including a leased or rented motor vehicle. 235 Under these circumstances, laboratories may be exempt from following all of the official shipping regulations if these criteria a re met. Permission for exemption must be granted by state officials. Packaging regulations and instructions however should always be followed for safety considerations. EXCLUSIVE MOTOR VEHI CLE EXCEPTION The exclusive motor vehicle exception found in 49 CF R \u00a7 173.134 (b)(10) may apply to a Division 6.2 material, other than a Category A infectious substance, contained in a patient sample being transported for research, diagnosis, investigational activities, or disease treatment or prevention, or a biological product, when such materials are transported by a private or contract carrier in a motor vehicle used exclusively to transport such materials. Medical or clinical equipment and laboratory products may be transported aboard the same vehicle provided they a re properly packaged and secured against exposure or contamination. If the human or animal sample or biological product meets the definition of regulated medical waste, it must be offered for transportation and transported in conformance with the appropria te requirements for regulated medical waste. An example of the Exclusive Motor Vehicle Exception in public health practice may be when a suspected outbreak patient drives their own stool sample to a health department. Always consult with local or state he alth departments if there are any questions or concerns. EMERGENCY RESPONSE I NFORMATION AND INCID ENT RESPONSE The requirements for Emergency Response information is contained in 49 CFR \u00a7 172, Subpart G. Emergency Response Information (ERI) must accompany C ategory A packages and be provided by the shipper to the courier when transported by air or motor vehicle. A Responsible Person's contact information and 24 Hour Emergency Contact information must be marked on the outside of the package, as well as appear ing on the Shipper's Declaration form. The Responsible Person can be either the shipper or the recipient. The Responsible Person needs to be knowledgeable about the material being shipped and has comprehensive emergency response incident mitigation infor mation, or information of someone who has immediate access to that information. The 24 Hour Emergency Contact information must be someone who is available the entire time the material is in transit, knowledgeable of the material being transported, and has comprehensive emergency response mitigation information for the material. The 24 Hour Emergency contact must be a live person capable of providing information about the included material. It must be maintained at all times that a shipment is in transit. The use of beepers, answering machines and switchboards is not authorized. The phone number must be to someone capable of providing information on the material. Written emergency response information must be appropriate for the hazardous material being transported. If the carrier's equipment has an emergency response guide or similar document on board there is no requirement to provide a separate emergency response document. For transportation by highway, if a transport vehicle contains hazardous materials for which a shipping paper is required and the transport vehicle is separated from its motive power and parked at a 236 location other than a facility operated by the consignee, consignor, or carrier, the carrier shall (1) Mark the transport vehicle with the telephone number of the motor carrier on the front exterior near the brake hose or electrical connection; or (2) have the shipping paper and emergency response information readily available on the transport vehicle. This requirement does not apply if the identification number for each hazardous materials contained therein is marked on the outside of the vehicle on an orange panel or white square on point placard.

INCIDENT REPORTING The release of infectious substances (Category A or B) during any mode of transportation must be reported to the Department of Transportation according to the incident reporting requirements listed in 49 CFR \u00a7171.15 and \u00a7171.16. Immediate notification of a hazardous materials incident by a carrier is required at the earliest practical moment for incidents that occur during the course of transportation (including loading, unloading, and temporary storage) in which as a direct result of the hazardous materials any one or more of the following occurs: 1. A person is killed; 2. A person receives an injury requiring admittance to a hospital; 3. The general public is evacuated for one hour or more; 4. A major transportation artery or facility is closed or shut down for one hour or more; or 5. Fire, breakage, spillage, or suspected radioactive contamination occurs involving a radioactive material; 6. Fire, breakage, spillage, or suspected contamination occurs involving an infectious substance other than a diagnostic specimen or reg ulated medical waste; 7. A release of a marine pollutant occurs in a quantity exceeding 450L (119 gallons) for a liquid or 400 kg (882 pounds) for a solid; or 8. A situation exists of such a nature (e.g., a continuing danger to life exists at the scene of the incident) that, in the judgment of the person in possession of the hazardous material, it should be reported to the National Response Center even though it does not meet the other criteria. Each notice shall be given telephonically to the DOT at (800) 424 -8802. Incidents involving etiologic agents may be made to the CDC at (800) 232 -0124. For content of report and additional information, please see \u00a7 171.15. A written report shall be submitted on DOT Form F 5800.1 for all incidents involving the transportati on of hazardous materials unless excepted. Detailed reporting requirements are contained in \u00a7 171.16. 237 For additional PERMIT S The CDC provides general information about permit requirements here: http://www.cdc.gov/od/eaipp/ . The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) permits are required for transport of infectious agents of livestock and biological materials containing animal material. Animal and animal products includes live animals, semen, embryos and materials derived from animals or exposed to animal -source materials such as animal tissues, blood, cells or cell lines of livestock or poultry origin, RNA/DNA extracts, h ormones, enzymes, microorganisms including bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. In addition, animal materials including dairy products (except butter and cheese), and meat products (e.g., meat pies, prepared foods) from countries with livestock diseases exotic to the U.S. Tissue culture materials and suspensions of cell culture grown viruses or other etiologic agents containing growth stimulants of bovine or other livestock origins are controlled by the USDA due to the potential risk of introduction of e xotic animal diseases into the U.S. The USDA, APHIS, Veterinary Services (VS) permit (VS 16 -3) may be required to be issued prior to the importation or domestic transfer (interstate movement) of etiologic disease agents of animal (i.e., livestock, poultry , and other animals), or plants, or specimens reasonably believed to contain animal or plant pathogens, any pest or vector of animal or plant disease, or potentially hazardous animal or plant product.

U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permits are required for certai n live animals, including bats. Please call 1 - 800- 344- WILD for further information or visit: www.fws.gov/ . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Import Permit Program (IPP) regulates the importation of infectious biological agents, infectious substances, and vectors of human disease into the United States. Prior to issuing an import permit, IPP reviews all applications to ensure that entities have appropriate safety measures in place for working safel y with these imported materials. The CDC Import Permit Program regulates the importation of the following into the United States: Naturally occurring or bioengineered infectious agents capable of causing disease in a human. Any material that is known or reasonably expected to contain an infectious biological agent. Vectors, including animals/animal products (e.g., a mount, rug or other item composed of animal hide, hair, skull, teeth, bones or claws), that are known to transfer or are capable of transferring an infectious biological agent to a human. 238 A CDC Import Permit is required if your facility imports any etiological agent, any arthropod or other animal host or vector of human disease, or any exotic living arthropod or other animal capable of being a host or vector of human disease. CDC Etiologic Agent Permit Program information can be found here: http://www.cdc.gov/od/ohs/biosfty/0753.pdf , or by phone at (404) 498- 2260. Laboratories are no t required to obtain USDA/APHIS permits for select agents. However, USDA/APHIS permits are still needed for Select Agent Exempt strains. A list of select agent exempt strains as well as general information, regulations and guidance about Select Biological Agent and Toxins can be found here: http://www.selectagents.gov/ . The Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP) issued a policy statement in February 2015 regarding when APHIS and CDC Import Permits are not required for the importation or interstate transportation of select agents. This policy change does not affect the perm it or transfer requirements for pathogenic plant select agents under 7 CFR \u00a7 330 and 7 CFR \u00a7 331. The policy statement titled, \"APHIS and CDC Import Permits Not Required for the Importation or Interstate Transportation of Select Agents\" can be found from t he National Select Agent Registry here: http://www.selectagents.gov/RegPolicyStatement.html . REQUEST TO TRANSFER SELECT AGENTS AND TO XINS The United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) develop regulations and guidance in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If a select biological agent or toxin is to be transferred from a facility, an APHIS/CDC Form 2 w ill be required and must be approved prior to the transfer. The APHIS/CDC Form 2, Request to Transfer Select Agents and Toxins, is used by entities to request prior authorization of a transfer of select agent(s) or toxin(s) from the Federal Select Agent P rogram as required by regulations (7 CFR \u00a7 331, 9 CFR \u00a7 121, and 42 CFR \u00a7 73).

The tables below are intended to provide recommended sources of some commonly used vendors and supplies, although this guidance doe s not specifically endorse any since several vendors sell similar products. Category A and B shipping containers are required to pass specific performance tests prior to their use. It is recommended to purchase supplies that meet the required standards ra ther than attempting to demonstrate your own packaging passes the tests. It is the responsibility of the packaging manufacturer and the person who offers hazardous materials for transportation; to the extent that assembly functions including final closure is performed by the latter, to assure that each package is capable of passing the prescribed tests. PERFORMANCE TESTS The following tests are performed as appropriate for each type of package: Drop Test, \u00a7 178.603; Leakproofness Bung -type Receptacle, \u00a7178.608; Vibration Standard, \u00a7 173.24a(a)(5). NOTE: Each section must be consulted to determine the applicable test for each type of container. PACKAGE TESTING Package testing consists of the following: Design Qualification Testing, \u00a7 178.601(c)(1); Periodic Retesting, \u00a7178.601(c)(2); Production Testing, \u00a7178.601(c)(3); Frequency of Periodic Testing, \u00a7178.601(e); Test Samples, \u00a7178.601(f). The person who manufactures a package subject to the requirements of the hazardous materials regulations is responsible to insure the package is in conformance with the requirements contained in 49 CFR \u00a7 178. When a pa ckage is required to be marked with a UN standard or DOT specification, the package must meet all the requirements of the regulation, including testing. The manufacturer or person certifying that the package is in compliance with \u00a7178 must inform in writin g each person to whom the packaging is transferred of all requirements of \u00a7 178 not met at time of transfer, and all actions that need to be taken for the package to conform to requirements of Part 178. The written statements must be retained by the manufac turer for at least one year per 49 CFR \u00a7 178.2(c). When filling packages with hazardous materials the shipper must comply with these written instructions. 243 PERFORMANCE ORIENTED PACKAGE MARKING The Manufacturer's Marking Requirement is contained in 49 CFR \u00a7 178.503 and cover the following: The United Nations symbol Packaging identification code consisting of: o Type of packaging. o Material of construction. o Category of packaging (when appropriate). o A letter identifying the performance standard. X - Meeting packing group I, II and III tests Y - Meeting packing group II and III tests Z - Meeting only packing group III tests o Specific gravity or mass (Specific gravity for packaging without inner linings designed to hold liquids rounded down to the first decimal for those non -viscous liquids having a specific gravity greater than 1.2. Maximum gross mass in kilograms for viscous liquids, solids, or inner packagings). o A letter \"S\" for packaging intended only for solids or inner packagings, test pressure in kilopascals of the hydrostatic test pressure. o The last two digits of the year of manufacture. o The letters indicating the country of origin (e.g., \"USA\"). o The name and address or symbol of the person applying the marks. o Other markings as applicable, such as: Month of manufacture for plastic drums (1H) and jerricans(3H). May be marked in a different location. Minimum thickness of packaging material in millimeters (mm) for metal or plastic drums or jerricans intended for reuse. Tare weight preceded by \"TW\" for packag ing intended for nitric acid. Reconditioned packaging. Items 1 -6 and thickness in millimeters must be applied in a permanent manner able to withstand reconditioning. The following additional markings are required: o Name of the country in which the reconditi oning was performed. o Name and address or symbol of the reconditioner. o Month and last two digits of the year of reconditioning. o The letter \"R\". o The letter \"L\" for packaging passing a leakproofness test. 244 DIAGRAM 21 .

DRY ICE GUIDANCE CHE CKLIST Dry ice is a Class 9 Miscellaneous Dangerous Good. Shipments containing dry ice must have an outer packaging able to allow the release of carbon dioxide gas as the dry ice sublimates. Depending on the packaging materials used, dry ice may surround a secondary container within an outer/tertiary container, or dry ice may surround a completed outer package, inside an overpack container. Dry ice must not be placed in a sealed container. The total quantity of dry ice included must always be listed on the outer packaging. If a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form is required (e.g., when shipping a Category A material), dry ice and its quantity must be listed. Packages containing dry ice must conform to Packing Instruction (PI) 954, and display the UN1845 hazard identification marking. When dry ice is included with a Category A shipment, the dry ice must be listed on the required Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form. When dry ice is included with a Category B or Exempt Specimen shipment, a Shipper's Declaration for Dangerous Goods form is not required.

Overpack is commonly used with shipments containing dry ice, and can also be use d to consolidate multiple completed packages into one larger container in order to: (1) reduce shipping costs by consolidation, (2) ship more than one class of hazardous material together, and/or (3) ship different temperature packages together. Inner packages are each individually wrapped and properly packed and labeled within the outer overpack Outermost packaging must be labeled with the highest hazard level of the inner contents Proper shipping name and the UN identification number Examples: o UN 3373 Biological Substances, Category B o UN 2814 Suspected Category A Infectious Substance, Affecting Humans o UN 2814 Infectious Substances, Affecting Humans NOTE: Special Provision A140 states: technical name can be omitted on outer package due to secur ity purposes, however, technical name must appear on Shipper's Declaration if required Full name, complete address and phone number of person responsible for the shipment (This ca n be either the shipper or the recipient, but must be someone knowledgeable of the contents) Full name, complete address and telephone number of the shipper Full name, complete address and telephone number of the consignee/recipient Class 6 diamond shape label for Category A mat erial and/or UN3373, Biological Substance label for Category B material Must be marked \"Overpack\" \"Inner packages comply with prescribed specifications\" label or sticker Orientation marks are on two opposing sides if containing liquids Quantity of total included hazardous contents is listed on outer packaging IF PACKAGE CONTAINS DRY ICE, INCLUDE: Class 9 Miscellaneous Hazard label The words \"Carbon dioxide, solid\" or \"Dry Ice\" in the Proper Shipping Name Column and UN1845 The included quantity in weight (e.g, 3kg) in the Quantity and Type of Packaging Column Consult Dry Ice Checklist for additional items 263 CHECKLIST 8 . EXEMPT SPECIMEN GUIDANCE CH ECKLIST Exempt Human Specimen and Exempt Animal Specimen shipments are not regulated under the DOT Hazardous Material Regulations for ground transport, but must still be triple packaged. Exempt Human and Animal Specimens are regulated u nder the IATA Dangerous Goods Regulations for air transport and must be labeled and triple packaged. Answer the questions below to determine if your shipment is classified as exempt: ________________________________________________________________ YES NO Is it known NOT to contain an infectious substance? Are the microorganisms present non- pathogenic to humans and animals? Have the pathogens present been neutralized or inactivated so they no longer pose a health risk? Is it an environmental sample (e.g., food or water) that is not considered to pose a significant health risk? Is it a biological product or a biological material (e.g., blood product, tissue, or organ) subject to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services or U.S. Department of Agriculture regulation? Is it a dried bloodspot or fecal occult blood? Is it laundry, medical equipment or a used health care product that conforms to 29 CFR 1910.1030? Is it forensic material that complies with U.S., state, local, or Indian tribal government regulations? Is it an agricultural product or food defined under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act? Is it intended for transplant or transfusion? Is it a patient specimen that is unlikely to cause disease in humans or animals or for which there is only a minimal likelihood that pathogens are present? _______________________________________________________________________________ If you were able to answer YES to ANY of the above questions, and your shipment does not contain an infectious substance, then it is not subject to the 6.2 regulations. 264 If you answered NO to ALL of the above questions, then you must conform to the Division 6.2 requirements and proceed to classify the shipment as either; o Category A o Category B A complete listing of materials excepted from regulation as Division 6.2 materials under the HMR is found in 49 CFR \u00a7173.134 265 CATEGORY A LIST VS. SELECT AGENT LIST CO MPARISON JOB AID Category A Infectious Substance List vs. Select Agent List Comparison The list of Select Biological Agents and Toxins closely resembles the Category A indicative list of organisms, although the overlap is not identical. There are some key differences between the lists, and both lists should be consulted for Category A shipping purposes. Sample classification for inclusion as a Category A shipment should take into account the organisms on the Health and Human Services (HHS) / U.S. Department of Agri culture (USDA) Select Agent list. Confirmed select agents must always be shipped as Category A, and potential or suspect select agents as \"Suspected Category A\". The HHS/USDA Select Biological Agent and Toxin list can be found here: http://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsList.html KEY DIFFERENCES BETW EEN THE LISTS: 1. The Category A and Select Agent lists are not identical. 2. Select Agent list is a complete list of regulated o rganisms and toxins. 3. Category A list is an indicative example list, and not considered to be all -inclusive. 4. Select agent list does not have the word \"culture\" after any names of organisms or toxins. 5. Category A list has the word \"culture\" only after some of the listed organisms, indicating that specific organism is only required to be classified as Category A when shipped in culture form. 6. Select Agent list is comprised of infectious microorganisms and toxins. 7. Category A list is comprised only of infectiou s microorganisms. Organisms that produce and that may contain a toxin are classified as Division 6.2 material and shipped as infectious material. If a purified or isolated toxin is shipped it is classified as Division 6.1 material. The following organisms and toxins appear on the Select Agent list, but currently not on the Category A list: Abrin African horse sickness virus Avian influenza virus 3 Botulinum neurotoxins* Conotoxins (Short, paralytic alpha conotoxins containing competent forms of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus containing any portion of the coding regions of all eight gene segments (Reconstructed 1918 Influenza virus) Ricin Rickettsia prowazekii 1 Agent 1 C = Cysteine residues are all present as disulfides, with the 1st and 3rd Cysteine, and the 2nd and 4th Cysteine forming specific disulfide bridges; The consensus sequence includ es known toxins -MI Asparagine or Histidine; X and; \"Des X\" = \"an amino acid does not have to be present at this position.\" For example if a peptide sequence were XCCHPA then the related peptide CCHPA would be designated as Des -X. 2 A virulent Newcastle disease virus (avian paramyxovirus serotype 1) has an intracerebral pathogenicity index in day -old chicks (G allus gallus) of 0.7 or greater or has an amino acid sequence at the fusion (F) protein cleavage site that is consistent with virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus. A failure to detect a cleavage site that is consistent with virulent strains does no t confirm the absence of a virulent virus. 3 Select agents that meet any of the following criteria are excluded from the requirements of this part: Any low pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, South American genotype of eastern equine encephalitis virus , west African clade of Monkeypox viruses, any strain of Newcastle disease virus which does not meet the criteria for virulent Newcastle disease virus, all subspecies Mycoplasma capricolum except subspecies capripneumoniae (contagious mycoides mycoides colony (Mmm SC) (contagious bovine pleuropneumonia), and any subtypes of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus except for Subtypes IAB or IC, provided that the individual or enti ty can verify that the agent is within the exclusion category (Revised 9/10/13). Select Agent website: www.selectagents.gov The website is the resource for forms, guidance, regulations, list of select agents and toxins, including Tier 1 designations. Always download the forms directly from the website to ensure use of current version. All questions or concerns should be coordinated with the LRN Reference Laboratory and State Health Department. 267 The following organisms appear on the Category A list, but currently not on the Select Agent list: Chalamydia psittaci (avian) (cultures only) Classical swine fever virus (cultures only) Coccidioides immitis (cultures only) Dengue virus (cultures only) Escherichia coli, verotoxigenic (cultures only) Hantavirus causing hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome Hantaan virus Hepatitis B virus (cultures only) Herpes B virus (cultures only) Human immunodeficiency virus (cultures only) Mycobacterium tuberculosis (cultures only) Poliovirus virus (cultures only) Rabies virus (cultures only) Rickettsia rickettsii (cultures only) Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (cultures only) Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (cultures only) Vesicular stomatitis virus (cultures only) West Nile virus (cultures only) Yellow fever virus (cultures only) Always refer to public health authorities (e.g., CDC, WHO, or other state or local public health agencies) for guidance when transporting a new or emerging pathogen or when there is a trans porting concern. 268 APPENDIX Bacillus Flowchart Yersinia pestis Characteristics Chart ................................ ................................ 282 Decontamination of Select Agents Isolated the Clinical Laboratory ................................ ............................ 283 What to Do When a Select Agent is Suspected in Your Lab ................................ 3 Job Aid ................................ ................................ ................................ ................................ . 321 ................................ ................................ ... 325 Tests to Differentiate Organisms Similar the Bioterrorism Agents ................................ ................................ 327 269 Bacillus anthracis Identification Flowchart Major characteristics of Bacillus anthracis : Gram stain morphology: Large, Gram positive rods.

Select Agent regulations detailed in 7 CFR 331, 9 CFR 121 and 42 CFR 73 dictate that select agents may only be held no more than 7 days from confirmation by facilities that are registered and approved by CDC and/or USDA to possess those specific select age nts. Once an isolate from a patient specimen in the clinical lab has been confirmed by the local Laboratory Response Network (LRN) Reference Laboratory as a select agent, the non- registered clinical lab must destroy all relevant patient specimens and cult ures remaining in their possession, or transfer them to the nearest LRN Reference Laboratory that is registered for those select agents. If a clinical lab decides to destroy the patient specimens and cultures, inactivation using an on -site autoclave or c hemical decontamination must be performed before transport to a medical waste contractor for destruction and disposal. Chemical Decontamination Process 1. Prepare a fresh 1:10 household bleach* solution in a receptacle large enough to submerge all containers/plates containing select agents. 2. Working in a BSC, completely immerse open culture containers in the bleach solution and leave containers in bleach solution overnight. 3. Once overnight inacti vation is complete, turn the sink faucet on and discard the bleach solution down the drain with running tap water. 4. Package the inactivated culture plates and containers with other biohazardous waste that is transported off site by a medical waste managemen t contractor for final treatment and disposal. If a clinical lab chooses to transfer the relevant specimens and cultures, lab personnel will need to work with the LRN Reference Laboratory to ensure that the proper paperwork and transfer protocols are fol lowed in compliance with all applicable local, state, and federal shipping regulations. Note : If an organism is subcultured from a blood culture bottle and a LRN Reference Laboratory confirms the organism as a select agent or the patient is diagnosed with smallpox or a VHF, the blood culture bottles and any additional bottles that would contain the organism, must be decontaminated before transport off site. The contents in these bottles cannot be adequately decontaminated using chemical decontamination and must be autoclaved on site. If the facility does not have an autoclave on site, all positive blood culture bottles must be transferred to the closest LRN Reference Laboratory registered and approved to accept the select agent. 284 APHIS/CDC SELECT AGE NT FORM 2 CHECKLIST KEY POINTS: Clinical/diagnostic laboratories that want to transfer select agents and toxins after identification should first contact the recipient laboratory to see if they are willing and able to receive the select agent or toxin.

SELEC T AGENT LIST COMPARI SON CATEGORY A INFECTIOU S SUBSTANCE LIST VS. SELECT AGENT LIST CO MPARISON The list of Select Biological Agents and Toxins closely resembles the Category A indicative list of organisms, although the overlap is not identical. There are some key differences between the lists, and both lists should be consulted for Category A shipping purposes. Sample classification for inclusion as a Category A shipment should take into account the organisms on the Health and Human Services (HHS) / U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Select Agent list. Confirmed select agents must always be shipped as Category A, and potential or suspect select agents as \"Suspected Category A\". The HHS/USDA Select Biological Agent and Toxin list can be found here: http://www.selectagents.gov/SelectAgentsandToxinsList.html Key differences between the lists: 1. The Category A and Select Agent lists are not identical. 2. Select Agent list is a complete list of regulated organisms and toxins. 3. Category A list is an indicative example list, and not considered to be all -inclusive. 4. Select agent list does not have the word \"culture\" after any names of organisms or toxins. 5. Category A list has the word \"culture\" only after some of the listed organisms, indicating that specific organism is only required to be classified as Category A when shipped in culture form. 6. Select Agent list is comprised of infectious microorganisms and toxins. 7. Category A list is comprised only of infectious microorganisms. Organisms that produce and that may contain a toxin are classified as Division 6.2 material and shipped as infectious material. If a purified or isolated toxin is shipped it is classified as Division 6.1 material. THE FOLLOWING ORGANI SMS AND TOXINS APPEA R ON THE SELECT AGEN T LIST, BUT CURRENTLY NOT ON THE CATEGORY A LIST: Abrin African horse sickness virus Avian influenza virus3 Botulinum neurotoxins* Conotoxins (Short, paralytic alpha conot competent forms of the 1918 pandemic influenza virus containing any portion of the coding regions of all eight 296 gene segments (Reconstructed 1918 Influenza Agent 1 C = Cysteine residues are all present as disulfides, with the 1st and 3rd Cysteine, and the 2nd and 4th Cysteine forming specific di sulfide bridges; The consensus sequence includes known toxins -MI and above) as well Asparagine or Histidine; X and; \"Des X\" = \"an amino acid does not have to be present at this position.\" For example if a peptide sequence were XCCHPA then the related peptide CCHPA would be designated as Des -X. 2 A virulent Newcastle disease virus (avian paramyxovirus serotype 1) has an intracerebral pathogenicity index in day -old chicks (Gallus gallus) of 0.7 or greater or has an amino acid sequence at the fusion (F) protein cleavage site that is consistent with virulent strains of Newcastle disease virus. A failure to detect a cleavage site th at is consistent with virulent strains does not confirm the absence of a virulent virus. 3 Select agents that meet any of the following criteria are excluded from the requirements of this part: Any low pathogenic strains of avian influenza virus, South Ame rican genotype of eastern equine encephalitis virus , west African clade of Monkeypox viruses, any strain of Newcastle disease virus which does not meet the criteria for virulent Newcastle disease virus, all subspecies Mycoplasma capricolum except subspeci es capripneumoniae mycoides subspecies mycoides small colony (Mmm SC) (contagious bovine pleuropneumonia), and any subtypes of Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus except for Subtypes I AB or IC, provided that the individual or entity can verify that the agent is within the exclusion category (Revised 9/10/13).
