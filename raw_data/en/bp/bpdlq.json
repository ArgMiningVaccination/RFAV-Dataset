While we hope your practice doesn't come across those particular competition issues, we do know of another type you more than likely face \u2014 keeping your fees competitive with other chiropractors near and far. With the year 2009 proving to be in a recession that affected various practices, the results of our 12th Annual Fees & Reimbursements Survey may surpriseyou \u2014 or they may not. With more than 500respondents answering our survey's question, \"Are yourfees competitive?\" you will want to take a look at theresults to see if yours are even with others and maybegain some insight on obtaining a competitive edge. Marketing also helps you gain a competitive edge. \"Speaking their language\" on page 15 shows you how tomarket to MDs with treatment plans and \"Reap the rewards of referrals\" on page 18 shows you three ways to market to the medicalprofessional. Both are sure to be helpful in your quest to be competitive. Working from the inside out is yet another way to be competitive. In \"Creating an inclusive culture\" on page 49, the author discusses how you canuse your staff for diversity education and how that in turn can enhance yourpractice's bottom line. Another way to help increase your bottom line and stay competitive is to know how to document properly. \"The documentation dilemma\" on page 23talks about three areas that must be explored so you can fully debug anydocumentation dilemmas. While gaining a competitive edge may take some work, it is worth it in the end \u2014 to your practice's bottom line and your future success.

The2010 FEP benefits brochure confirms the change. It was in January of this year that BCBSA changed the designation of doctors of chiropractic from \"physicians\" to\"other healthcare providers.\" ACA immediatelyrecognized that the change could have a serious impacton whether DCs would be allowed to provide thephysician-level services they are educated and licensed toperform \u2014 and could even influence whether chiropracticcare would later be restricted or completely excluded in anational healthcare plan using the FEP as a model. ACApromptly contacted BCBSA and requested that thedesignation be reversed. While BCBSA stated the change would not affect benefits, some plans apparently misinterpreted the intentof the change and restricted services such asexaminations, x-rays, and therapeutic modalities. In addition, some DCs have been prohibited from referring FEP patients for other services, includingdiagnostic and physical and occupational therapy services.DCs still encountering these problems under the FEPshould contact the ACA Insurance Relations Departmentat Insinfo@acatoday.org.

Source: American Chiropractic Association, www.acatoday.org HEALTH NEWS Research: How can chiropractic treatment keep the bed dry? There are two terms associated with bed-wetting \u2014 primary enuresis and secondary enuresis. Secondary enuresis is defined as bedwetting after an extended period of drynights has been established (six months or more). Primaryenuresis is bedwetting that has persisted since infancy. According to Anne Packard-Spicer, DC, DACCP , faculty clinician at the Bloomington Natural Care Centerat Northwestern Health Sciences University inBloomington, Minn., primary enuresis generally resolvesitself by age 10 and may relate to heredity, alteredhormone levels or bladder development. According to Packard-Spicer, seeing a chiropractor may be helpful for treating secondary enuresis. The sacrum is alarge, roughly triangular-shaped bone at the base of thespine. In childhood, this sacrum is made up of five separatebones that fuse by the late teen to early adult years.Misalignments of the sacral segments alter the pathway forthe nerve as it exits to the bladder, and information fromthe bladder as it returns to the brain. This has the abilityto change the function of the bladder or the perception bythe brain of the fullness of the bladder. \"Chiropractic adjustments correct the misalignment which allows the nerve to carry information freely andcompletely between the bladder and the brain,\" says Dr.Packard-Spicer. \"If enuresis or bedwetting is adjustment can restorenormal night-time dryness.\" According to Packard-Spicer, some possible causes of secondary enuresis include falling on the buttocks,causing a misalignment of the sacral segments; bladderinfections; constipation; strong psychological stressorssuch as a death in the family, parental abuse, or sexualassault; and children who are chronically overtired. Other natural healthcare modalities may also be used to treat secondary enuresis, according to Packard-Spicer.If a bladder infection has been ruled out, herbs thatsupport the underlying cause may be helpful. An Orientalmedicine practitioner or doctor of naturopathic medicinemay also be able to treat this condition through the use ofherbs or supplements.

But these two professions can, and should, aim toward a degree of collaboration. As always, communication is the starter. Once a positive communicationatmosphere has been established, youcan work together successfully for thepatient's, as well as your own, recoveryand overall well-being. MDs can be an amazingly productive referral source, and the results can beastounding and beneficial for allconcerned. You can take on difficultcases that don't respond well toconventional medicine and that MDswould prefer not to deal with \u2014chronic pain, workers compensation,and personal injury cases. Communications techniques So how should you communicate? By speaking doctors' language through a medium they need, know, and respect\u2014 the treatment plan. Fortunately, it's part of yourlanguage as well. If you're treating a family practice patient, send the doctor a treatment plan, clearly marked as such,accompanied by a brief and professional cover letter thatexplains what you're sending and why you're sending it. Stamp the envelope \"Patient Records: Confidential.\" By addressing the envelope this way, doctors are legallyrequired to open the envelope and read what is inside.What you include inside determines whether or not theyread on. If you present the material well, you are taking agiant step toward a positive professional relationship. The marketable treatment plan One can not emphasize enough the importance of writing a good treatment plan. The treatment plan isdeveloped out of the evaluation and management process,which in turn is informed by the Medicare Guidelines formedical necessity. It should convey clearly that the case has been accurately diagnosed and that you have followed logicalsteps in coming up with a care plan, focusing on data,strategy, and rationale. Medicare outlines it as follows: Frequency and duration; Treatment you plan to provide and why; Specific treatment goals; and Objective measures for treatment effectiveness. The plan you share with the primary care physician should also include the following supportive documentation, all ofwhich normally is developed out of the initial patient visit: History: Describe the complaint, registering what the patient says is wrong and what you determine fromreviewing the complaint and conducting the initialexamination. Be direct, and in your history stick with thespecific complaint. Speaking their language Market to MDs with treatment plans By Bharon HoagmarketingCHEC_15.ps 10/12/09 O CTOBER 28, 2009marketing Exam: Be clear about how you respond to the patient's description of the pain or impairment. Be complete and concise, and wherever possible support your conclusionsby referencing recognized guides such as clinical notessystems or exam forms. Medical decision-making: Demonstrate that your treatment decisions are based on reviewable data,diagnoses/case management options, and/or evaluation ofrisk of complications (morbidity, mortality). Establish theproblem severity level using at least two of these threefactors. Show that your decision-making is informed through the patient history and your examination. Indicate clearlythat the problem has been thoroughly thought-throughand that you have followed logical steps in coming upwith a care plan. It should come as no surprise that the reason this approach works is that it follows a model also basic to theactivities of the primary care physician. Easy does it You must be mindful of patient considerations. Patient records are confidential, but the intake forms yourpatients sign should include the option to decline sharingthe information with their primary care physician. Most have no problem with this, but an exception might be the occasion in which the patient specificallydoes not want the primary care doctor to know he or sheis seeing another doctor. This highly effective marketing initiative shouldn't require any additional work from you. Assuming that anautomated notes/documentation solution is in place, thedocumentation involved is stored and formatted at theconclusion of each patient visit. All that remains is to printthe report and courtesy letter, which can be formatted foreasy adaptability and distribution by the front office. The same procedure should be followed each time you do a re-evaluation and over time, your MDs will discernthat you are serious about case management; that you arehighly professional; that you comply fully with healthcareregulations; and that you are a reliable option for handlingcertain cases that don't respond well to conventionalmedical treatment.

He can be reached through www.acomhealth.com. CHEC_16.ps I SSUE 17 O CTOBER 28, 2009marketing Marketing to the medical profession must be a part of any well-rounded chiropractic office. Often it is fear of rejection that holds chiropractors back from connecting with MDs. And fear of the unknown or misinformation often prevents medicaldoctors from connecting with chiropractors. One must realize that most medical doctors and chiropractors have the same goal in mind \u2014 gettingpatients well as fast and as economical as possible. Oncephysicians better understand what chiropractic has tooffer, they tend to have less problems referring when theysee the necessity. Getting the right angle So how do you get referrals from physicians? It takes some effort, and as with any other marketing tool you use,you must approach it from several angles. Provide medical reports. The first step is to provide a medical report, which should be a simple, to-the-pointreport you complete on all new patients. It should includea brief history, examination, radiology findings, and adiagnosis, as well as a prognosis and expected time frame. This helps keep your name in front of the doctor and should be part of your new patient paperwork protocol.All new patients to your clinic should have a report sentto their primary care physicians and any specialist theymay have seen for the condition. According to HIPAA guidelines, don't forget to obtain the patient's permission, which should be on the initialintake form. Conduct \"lunch and learns.\" The purpose of lunch and learns is to meet physicians face to face. Regardless ofthe results you obtain with their patients, many physicianswill still not be a strong referral source until you actuallymeet them. It is good to be able to put a face to a name and once that meeting is made, the referrals usually begin. A lunchand learn can be you providing lunch for the doctor andhis staff at his office or taking the doctor out to lunch at alocal restaurant. Your presentation should touch on the basics of chiropractic care. It must be well written, nonoffending,and presented in a positive, confident manner by memory.In the event the space is not suitable for a PowerPointpresentation, give a brief synopsis on chiropractic. Keep it simple; in addition, explain the types of cases you typically see in your office. Let the physician and staffknow you will make their referrals a priority and will getany of their patients in on the same day. Explain that youwill send a report within 24 hours and always encouragethe patient to follow up with their primary doctor posttreatment \u2014 then make sure you do just that. Show thatyour word means something. Things to bring to the meeting should include officeReap the rewards of referrals 3 ways to market to the medical professional By Ben Storey, DCCHEC_18.ps 10/12/09 1:10 PM Page 18CHEC_19.ps 10/12/09 VOL55: I SSUE 17 O CTOBER 28, 2009marketing referral pads and possibly pens or magnets with your logo on them.Always follow up your meeting with anote thanking them for their time andstating that you are looking forward toworking with them in the future. Build awareness. Now that you have met the doctor and his or herstaff, you must keep your name infront of them. The medical report(mentioned above) is absolutelycrucial for this, but you need to takeit a step further. Take mental notes of anything that comes up during the initialmeeting you may be able to utilizelater. Keep a database with as muchpersonal information from thephysician as possible. For example: During one medical luncheon, it came up that the doctorpracticed for awhile in Pennsylvania,and in the course of conversationsaid he was an avid PittsburghSteelers fan. If and when your teamsplay each other, you could have acake delivered with the teamshelmets on them, wishing him luck. In addition, this particular doctor's nurse has a son on the local highschool cross country team. When yousee the next positive article in thenewspaper regarding the crosscountry team, send her acongratulatory note. Use yourimagination. There are many waysyou can utilize this information. You can also deliver a gift basket for the holidays or something assimple as a cookie tray with yourbusiness card attached. This canspread tons of goodwill. Keep your focus Don't go to a first meeting and try to convince the medical doctor tosend you all of their ear infectionand asthma cases. Focus onmusculoskeletal complaints \u2014 this isyour specialty! Be assured, if you gointo the meeting and debate on thechiropractic scope of practice, youprobably aren't going to be gettingmany medical referrals. Marketing to medical professionals isn't always easy. It takes effort andhard work on your part, but as in allthings, the hard work will pay off.The goal for both parties is theoverall health and well-being of thepatients you serve. Ben Storey, DC, is a 1997 graduate of Parker College ofChiropractic and owner ofStorey Chiropractic Center in San Angelo, Texas. He is also a consultantfor Integrity Management.Enhancing overall wellness With the increasing popularity of chiropractic care in the United States, interprofessional relationships between conventional-trained physicians and chiropractors will have an expanding impact on patient care. Chiropractors and medical doctors are now much more comfortable working together in situations where medical care is necessary inaddition to chiropractic care. Physicians are very influential in referringpotential patients to chiropractic. Although physicians and chiropractors use different methods for managing health, combining the two different approaches can enhancethe overall health and wellness for the patient. It would be beneficialfor medical doctors and chiropractors to work together and establish areferral system because the goal for both is to heal and improve thehealth of their patients. CHEC_20.ps 10/12/09 CTOBER 28, 2009 WWW .CHIRO ECO.COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 23Arecent, informal survey of chiropractors indicated thenumber one fear they have is that their documentation will not pastmuster. Chiropractors cite the recent increase in audit activity as well as articles and newsflashes about doctors being forced to pay back thousands, to hundreds of thousands ofdollars to insurance companies or Medicare. Although this fear permeates each and every office visit, the bigger concern was they don't know what iswanted for documentation in order to please the carriers. Many carriers provide guidelines and definitions regarding documentation and necessity parameters; however,many doctors don't know they exist. Armed with thisinformation, you would have a much clearer indication ofwhat initial and daily visit documentation should look like. Equally important, however, is even when documentation is completed to these standards, the visitsmust meet medical necessity guidelines. In essence, you arecertifying by submitting this bill that this visit warrantsthird-party coverage, according to policy definitions. It is often discovered that guidelines for third-party coverage tend to differ from your opinion of what shouldbe paid. Therein lies the documentation dilemma. Three areas must be explored to fully debug this dilemma: 1. A clear understanding of the definitions of medical nececessity. 2. A firm grasp of why clinically appropriate care may not be reimbursable. 3. The wild card: How to get patients to understand that while they may have an insurance policy covering 20visits a year, the intent of the policy is not carte blanche\u2014 those 20 visits must meet definitions of necessity thatyou certify, thus putting your liability on the line. The documentation dilemma By Kathy Mills ChangCHEC_23.ps 10/12/09 1:15 PM Page I SSUE 17 O CTOBER 28, 2009practice management Understanding medical necessity definitions Most every carrier has a medical policy, which lay out the parameters to be followed by reviewers and adjusters. It's vital you understand how claims will be adjudicated. Claims are paid based on the good faith that you are billing only services that meet those necessity guidelines. If a carrier wishes to, they can review after payment is made, look at the notes, and find that necessity is notclearly documented. That is when post-payment reviewsnet big paybacks to carriers. In most cases, carriers don't see your daily notes when they pay a claim; they see only what's on your 1500 billing form. That is why poor billing practices and inattention to detail can build an unfavorable profile at the carrier leveland can lead to computerized audits which identify potentialproblems \u2014 and then you're into a full-blown audit! Medicare has a clear definition of medical necessity, spelled out in the Local Coverage Documents for mostevery carrier. It reads: The patient must have a significant health problem in the form of a neuromusculoskeletal condition necessitatingtreatment, and the manipulative services rendered must have adirect therapeutic relationship to the patient's condition andprovide reasonable expectation of recovery or improvementof... \"FUNCTION.\" This definition expects that your documentation will show direct therapeutic relationship of your treatment andthat the patient can improve their function. However, a big mistake made in the documentation process is the lack of functional tracking. If you must show improvement of function, you should measure it in the beginning and along the way. It's imperative to measure the deficits in activities of daily living in the beginning and to comment on themvisit by visit until you've reached your stated goals. It's aclear roadmap for success. Cigna has an 11-page guideline of policies they use to adjudicate claims and identify necessity. It is also acomprehensive and clear explanation of documentationrequirements of two major carriers most offices deal with.Even so called cash practices must deal with Medicare andmeet this level of documentation. For this reason, ensure you know the required guidelines for any carrier you bill on behalf of yourpatients. If errors are found or inadequacies are identified,the carrier has the right to ask for a refund. CHEC_24.ps 10/12/09 1:16 PM Page 24VOL55: I SSUE 17 28, 2009 WWW .CHIRO ECO.COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 25Why clinically appropriate may not be medically necessary Chiropractic techniques and philosophies that strive to reconstruct the spine, restore curves, etc. tend to take longer than average lengths of treatment and may requiremore visits. This care may be considered clinically appropriate to the patient and you, but not the carrier. If the definitions noted above are not met, then the care would be considered an elective or cash service. Nobody is telling you not to treat the patient according to your plan, but that it's possible that third-partycoverage is not available for part of that care which doesnot meet the guidelines of the carrier. The May 2009 OIG report of chiropractic claims submitted in 2006 indicates that Medicare inappropriatelypaid $178 million in claims. The majority was attributableto care paid and upon post payment review was identifiedas maintenance \u2014 largely because DCs didn't identifynew acute or chronic episodes of care. The report further states that carriers were unable to determine when new episodes began and it looked asthough ongoing care over a period of time was strungtogether. It's more likely the patient presented for several acute or chronic episodes in that time frame which were not clearly documented and reported. Because of this, thereport deduces that chiropractors do not comply withdocumentation requirements. Patient education and understanding rules For years, patients would stop by the chiropractor on their way home, get adjusted, and know they probably Many carriers provide guidelines and definitions regarding documentation and necessity parameters; however, many doctors don't know they exist.CHEC_25.ps 10/12/09 1:16 Page O CTOBER 28, 2009practice management didn't have to pay out of pocket. Now that guidelines are clearer, rules are more defined, and belts are tightening, it's often hardest on thepatient who has been well trained toget in when they have pain to hearthat's not good enough anymore \u2014and it is one of the biggest concernsnow in Medicare. Easily discernable is the standard that a patient is either on an activetreatment plan or on a maintenancecare. Any patients caught in betweenneed to be re-evaluated andidentified as one or the other. Practices that allow patients to be caught in between and bill insurancecarriers for this care are at risk ofsevere repercussions if a post paymentreview is performed. You are assumingthe patient's liability when you allowa patient to randomly access care, atwill, and expect the carrier to pay it. It's generally accepted that active treatment plans ranging from threetimes a week to once a week areusually within the guidelines. But extended care at once a week, every other week, or monthly, clearlylooks like maintenance care. Takethis opportunity to educate yourpatients again on what is covered bythird-party payers and what isn't. Move them to a cash payment plan that will allow them tocontinue the recommended care thatmay not be covered by the carrier. Besure you're using a discount medicalprovider plan if you wish to discountthis care. It's the safest way to go. Every provider should make it a priority to improve documentation.That doesn't simply mean takingbetter notes. It means writing betterplans and, most importantly, beingan incredible case manager. Look at your patients' care as episodic, moving freely betweenactive and maintenance care. This may look like more work for your office and for you, but once thepatient is educated in the proper useof third-party payers and howimportant their stake in their care is,they will be on board. The safety and security of managing your patients' casescorrectly will ensure that you'llsurvive post payment audits, meetthe requirements of any contractsyou participate with, and serve yourpatients fairly and completely.

Even with theeconomy being a bit rocky in 2009, fees andreimbursements remained fairly steady with the resultsfrom the 2007 survey. This year's survey shows the average reimbursement ($47) was down from last year ($51) \u2014 a difference of 7.8percent \u2014 but still higher than in 2007 ($45). This year'sfees ($68) were also down from last year's ($69) \u2014 adifference of 1.4 percent \u2014 but still more than in 2007'ssurvey ($64). The latest figures, based on responses of 507 individuals (readers and other chiropractors) who answered oursurvey, seem to still show a continuing trend of decliningreimbursements: from 2003 to 2007, they were 79.4percent, 78.7 percent, 74.3 percent, 72.8 percent, and70.8 percent. Last year's survey showed an increase to 73.9percent, but this year's results are back in line, falling to69.1 percent. In a similar survey published in the February 2009 issue of Physicians Practice , a business journal for medical doctors, it appears that chiropractors aren't the onlyhealthcare profession seeing a shift. While DCs saw theirfees charged remain similar to past years, reimbursementaverages dropped significantly. On the other hand, MDssaw a positive shift in reimbursement averages comparedto the fees they charged. HIGHLIGHTS Some other facts that caught our attention include: Licensure: Our current survey shows an upward spike in doctors of chiropractic maintaining licensure inonly one state. In 2008, the results revealed 63.6 percentof DCs were licensed in one state, whereas this year shows75.4 percent are \u2014 an increase of 18.5 percent. DCslicensed in two states fell to 17.6 percent this year from25.8 percent in 2008 \u2014 a decrease of 31.7 percent. Solo vs. group. Solo still reigns as the preferred practice mode. This year, 73.7 percent reported they werea solo practitioner, remaining fairly consistent with thelast two years' surveys \u2014 74.0 percent in 2008 and 74.7OUR 12TH ANNUAL FEES & REIMBURSEMENTS SURVEY Are your fees competitive?

Franchises holding their own: In 2007, we reported that franchises comprised 5.3 percent of all respondents. That percentage dropped to 4.0 percent lastyear, but increased this year to 5.9 percent for an 11.3percent increase over 2007. Cash-only practice. The 2006 survey saw a record high in which 21.1 percent of DC respondents indicatedthey were operating a cash-only practice. In 2007, this fellto 15.0 percent and fell again in 2008 to 11.0 percent.This year saw yet another decrease to 8.8 percent. Cash-only practices saw a collection rate of $63 compared to$80 last year and $65 in 2007. Payment options. Payment options remained an important part of our respondents' practices. Even thoughDCs reduced offers of payment plans from 72.5 percent in2007 to 64.9 percent in 2008, payment plans saw a niceincrease this year to 74.4 percent \u2014 a 2.6 percent increaseover 2007. Prepay plans took over the second place spot with 39.5 percent (compared to 39.2 percent in 2008), whilenegotiations on a case-by-case basis decreased from 41.7percent last year to 37.5 percent this year for third place. Most popular specialist. Retaining the services of a licensed massage therapist remains at the top of themost popular specialist list, with 42.8 percent of therespondents saying they have one. A licensed massagetherapist also tops the list of specialists working in a solopractice (39.6 percent) and group practice (59.4 percent). Highest reimbursement rates. The West took top honors for highest reimbursement rates with 73.9percent, followed by the Eastern region with 71.6 percent,the Midwest with 67.1 percent, and the South with 62.8percent.

This year's survey shows that reimbursement rates dropped for both practices, but camemore in line with two years ago. Solopractitioners' reimbursement rates were 67.6percent compared to 70.8 percent in 2008 and68.7 percent in 2007, and group practitionersrates were 71.6 percent compared to 77.0percent last year and 72.7 percent for 2007.

This may indicate the reason for the drop in fees and reimbursementaverages, as well as the shift in reimbursement rates for franchise owners. Franchise owners saw a decrease in fees charged (from $79 in 2008 to $68 in 2009), as well as a decrease in reimbursement averages (from$61 to $38). These are compared to this year's overall fee andreimbursement averages of $68 and $47, respectively. Similarly, franchise owners also saw a decrease in reimbursement rates, falling from 68.3 percent last year to 55.8 percent in 2009. This is compared to this year's overall reimbursement rate average of69.1 percent. Other franchising facts Like years past, the average age of franchise owners is slightly younger than the overall average (38.7 compared to 44.4). This year'ssurvey also indicated that males are more likely to own franchises at86.2 percent. A little more than half of franchise owners are solo practitioners (58.6 percent), while 34.4 percent are in a group and 6.8 work as associates. Favored modalities offered by the franchise owners are exercise (79.3 percent), physical therapy (68.9 percent), and massage (58.6 percent).$0$10$20$30$40$50$60$70 Overall Franchise Operations Fees Reimbursements 2008 20090%20%40%60%80% Overall FranchiseComparison of Franchise Fees and Reimbursements with Overall Averages Franchise Reimbursement Rates68 47 68 38 74.2 69.1 68.3 55.8 A change in cash-only rates The past three year's surveys have seen a decrease in respondents reporting cash-only practices. In 2006, respondents reported the highest percent at 21.1 percent, but then the responses decreasedto 15.0 percent in 2007, down again to 10.7 percent in 2008, andthen down yet again to our current percentage of 8.8 percent. As we pointed out the last two years, 2006 might have been an anomaly with that year's particular survey. More likely, however,given the good economy of 2006, it might have been easier toobtain cash from a patient than in less robust economies. Cash fees charged in 2008 reached $80 compared to $65 in 2007 and $63 this year. By strict definition, a cash-only practice would have no reimbursements. So, fees in a cash-only practice are equivalent toreimbursements (collections). Cash-only practices fees of $63 are a34.0 percent increase compared to an overall averagereimbursement of $47. Who runs cash-only practices? Our survey shows the majority of DCs (81.3 percent) are male, age 46.7, and 81.3 percent are in solopractices. Those respondents operating cash-only practices havebeen working as a practitioner for 15.8 years.

But what can you do to create an atmosphere in your practice that will enable you to reap all the benefits of diversity in your office staff? An alternative approach might be to create a more inclusive \"culture of diversity\" through a long-term,relational approach that emphasizes an attitudinal andcultural transformation in which you break barriers bymoving away from \"managing diversity\" toward\"managing fordiversity.\" Research indicates the organizational culture of your practice directly impacts how it performs, and therefore,directly impacts your bottom line. Creating an inclusiveculture of diversity in your practice will provide a realisticopportunity for a culture that promotes diversity andinclusion, and will give you the opportunity to capitalizeon the contributions of a diverse office staff. And it's exactly that type of culture that will provide facilitators the best opportunity to present diversityeducation programs to your staff without evoking negativeemotional reactions such as guilt, shame, defensiveness,stereotyping, and/or resentment. Culture of diversity Managing for diversity (i.e., creating an inclusive culture) provides the best chance for lowering turnoveramong diverse employees, attracting new employees, andrealizing the benefits from such a labor force. It creates aculture in which your staff can be proud of their uniqueperspectives and are willing and even eager to share them. Without such an atmosphere, you can't incorporate these perspectives into improving your practice and you'llmiss opportunities to capitalize on these insights andimprove your bottom line.

Creating this inclusive culture will require a change in the way youcurrently think about and conductdiversity education programs.Managing for diversity is a proactive,ongoing strategy that creates aculture within which peopleappreciate and can capitalize onindividual differences \u2014 regardless ofchanging legal, demographic, andeconomic conditions. Your diversity education programs must focus on more than visualidentities (such as gender, race,ethnicity, etc.) that might hinder theemergence of an inclusive environ-ment by overemphasizing differencesrather than commonalities and/orcollective identities at the expense ofindividual identities. They mustaddress the hidden identities (such asvalues, beliefs, desires, and needs) andthe cognitive and behavioral stylesthat your staff bring to your practice. Making an approach One approach to a different kind of diversity education program is the useof life stories coupled with food in asocially inclusive setting. Because thesharing of food is typically viewed as asimplistic way to create awareness ofother cultures, emphasize the lifestories portion with food serving onlyto tempt participation. The stories will prompt the explorations of differences, whichwill result in an atmosphere ofopenness and dialogue within whichparticipants will share aspects ofthemselves that might otherwise beoverlooked in the collective identityof the practice. You may want to consider using teams to tell the stories; some staffmight be reluctant to participate asan individual but may feel morecomfortable participating on a team. Set aside time for this on a regular basis, such as at the beginning of ameeting, during lunch, or on anafternoon or morning break. Thestories should be structured aroundsomething of general interest to allparticipants \u2014 perhaps on music, abook, art, or favorite quote.

You should have an experienced facilitator available to \"tease out\"and adapt the stories to key issues inthe practice. Facilitators must beopen-minded, allowing discussiontopics to emerge from the questions,comments, and enhancements thatmembers present. Facilitators can ask leadingquestions such as \"What issues can weidentify for further discussion towardunderstanding the nature of humanbeings?\" \"How can we apply thelessons learned here to our practice?\"\"What issues introduced in this storycan we capitalize on in an effort tohonor and make comfortable everymember of our workforce?\" and \"Whatissues introduced in this story can wecapitalize on in our practice?\" Your staff might just be surprisingly insightful! Whose up first? It is imperative that you be the first to present a story. Doing sosends the message that you supportthe program and defines the scope ofthe exercise, such as the size of thefood snack and the length andintensity of the story. Likewise, by demonstrating open and sharing behaviors, you portray acultural expectation that staff wouldmore likely be willing to replicate. Following your presentation, invite your staff to schedule andshare a story at future meetings.Sharing must be voluntary andvolunteers must choose what theywant to share. Not all participants will volunteer, while others will seek multipleopportunities to share. However,most staff will look forward to thepresentations and learning somethingabout others. Once sharing activitiesbecome an expectation or culturalnorm, volunteerism tends to increase. Managing for diversity can provide you a competitive advantage anddirectly impact your bottom linethrough the attraction, retention,and leveraging of the uniquecapacities of a diverse workforce bycreating a relational culture ofinclusiveness in your practice. Your diversity education program can help you get there by creating alearning experience that your staff isintrinsically motivated to takeownership of \u2014 thereby giving you adiversity education program thatreally works.

Physician referrals are especially valuable because patient acceptance is almost guaranteed and the fees tend to be less important when someone has been highlyrecommended to you by a trusted physician. In addition, unlike patient referrals which are self- limiting, physician referrals can be an endless source ofnew patients. How do you get started? A new book, titled Marketing Chiropractic to Medical Practices (Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 2009), explains a process that will provide you with tested tips to promotechiropractic ethically and professionally, and mostimportantly, cost-effectively to the medical world. The author, Christina L. Acampora, DC, writes, \"From a promotional standpoint, we have enough research datato emphatically promote manipulation and chiropracticcare for the lower back and neck regions as well as forheadaches. These are the conditions for which care shouldbe promoted first. \"This is not to say,\" Acampora adds, \"that chiropractors can't associate themselves with carpal tunnel or knee painand so on. The research shows that we get most of ourbusiness from treating neck and lower back. The researchalso illustrates that physicians have few options to offerthese patients except medication and referrals. By startingwith these strong cases for which it is appropriate to utilizechiropractic care, we can then build trust and rapport thatwill open the door to referrals for other conditions. \"The bottom line from a promotional standpoint,\" Acampora writes, \"is to promote only research referencedin a peer-reviewed, notable journal and to not stretch themeaning of findings beyond which they were intended torelate. If you believe drugs are bad, immunizations areunnecessary, and chiropractic can cure asthma, stop andre-evaluate the position you are putting the profession inwhen you promote these unsubstantiated claims tomedical doctors.\"Action steps: Acampora explains the types of practices with which you can start the networking process; whatyou should bring when you make your first contact; andhow to get time with the doctor \u2014 starting with gettingpast the gatekeeper (front desk person). She next offersguidelines for meeting the doctor and suggests as a firstattempt, the following: Hello, Dr. XX. My name is XX and I am a chiropractor located on XX Road. I wanted to stop by and introduce myselfand my services. As you know, many patients are interested inalternative care and recent warnings on medications are fuelingthat interest. Are you familiar with any of the evidence-basedresearch on manipulation? \"If the response is positive,\" Acampora writes, \"indicate that you can make a lunch appointment, or ask the doctorif he or she would prefer to go out to dinner. If the responseis really positive, the doctor might give you 10 minutesright away.\" If the response is negative, she suggests severalapproaches to turn the conversation around. Reality check: According to the National Board of Chiropractic Examiners 2005 Job Analysis, chiropractorsspend roughly $1,000 a month on advertising. \"A portion of this money could make a more direct hit,\" says Acampora, \"if it was spent on lunches or dinnerengagements (or arranging a luncheon meeting in thedoctor's office) to help develop rapport and relationshipswith medical professionals. Spending $50 on lunch with adoctor in a small office who has patients to refer seems likea better choice than spending $500 a direct-mail flyer.\" This 300-page book provides guidelines to educate medical doctors to utilize chiropractic services for theirpatients; the words to use and those to avoid; and how toovercome the negativity and misconceptions some mayhave about chiropractic. It utilizes current evidence-based research to illustrate how chiropractors can present key findings in a convincing way. \"It is time,\" Acampora writes, \"to introduce ourselves into the inner circle of healthcare and forge relationshipswith medical professionals.\" Bob Levoy's newest book, 222 Secrets of Hiring, Managing, and Retaining Great Employees inHealthcare Practices, is published by Jones and Bartlett Publishers.

The pros and cons of buying vs. leasing your chiropractic office By Dale Willerton Many chiropractors dream of purchasing or constructingtheir own building or property. The main reason that dream cannot, or does not, come to be is because more than 95 percent of all commercial, retail, and office space is for lease, not for sale \u2014 and it'sthat simple. Many good locations suitable for your chiropractic office, such as strip plazas or street front office spaces, are ownedby a landlord who does not want to sell you the property,but rather wants you to be a long-term, paying tenant. If you could own your own location, would you? Most would probably say yes, but unless you are willing to movefrom your current leased premises to a lesser location, youmay have trouble finding a suitable purchase orconstruction opportunity. Decisions, decisions, decisions Some pros and cons to consider regarding leasing versus purchasing commercial, retail, or office property include: Pro 1: It is better to pay a mortgage than a lease because you can pay off a mortgage, whereas lease paymentscontinue. More often than not, a monthly mortgagepayment is similar in amount to a monthly rent payment. Pro 2: Equity in your property will increase over time. This does not include the value of the practice, just thereal estate, and appreciated value will vary from locationto location and city to city. Pro 3: You don't have landlord hassles, you feel in control, and can open and close the practice when youwant. Yes, ownership is empowering and most of the timeit feels great. Con 1: You might have to sacrifice location strength or desirability as many ownership opportunities are insecondary locations and not on busier streets. If you aremoving an existing practice into a secondary location forpurchase it's not so bad because you have loyal patientswho will follow you. Con 2: You would have to move out or away from your current space giving up a well-established location thatanother chiropractor might lease. Landlords almost alwaystry to replace one industry tenant with another so thepossible competition should be a potential concern to you. Con 3: You may have to become a handyman or deal with various ownership issues such as heating, ventilationand air conditioning (HVAC) units, buildingmaintenance, etc. that a landlord would have otherwisetaken care of for you. CHEC_59.ps 10/12/09 1:36 I O CTOBER 28, 2009finances make a deal! Sometimes you can negotiate \"special deals.\" For example: A consultant was negotiating a lease renewal for five chiropractors whowere sharing a fairly large office in asmall strip plaza. In fact, thechiropractic office occupied abouthalf of the entire plaza. Even though the landlord did not want to sell this property, theconsultant negotiated a First Right toPurchase Option for the chiropractors.With going one step further, theconsultant also negotiated thepurchase price at the then currentmarket value \u2014 even though theirpurchase option would not likely beused for about five years. The consultant also put the deal together so that each chiropractorwas on the lease independently. Thisway, one doctor could sell hispractice to another new incomingdoctor without messing around withthe lease agreement each time. Currently, that building has doubled in value; however, thechiropractors can purchase it for thelesser price the consultant originallynegotiated for \u2014 and it will be anice profit on paper for the doctors. Lasting impressions Don't purchase and move your practice into a property for the sakeof owning real estate. Only purchasea property for your practice if youwould lease it anyway. In otherwords, don't resign your practice to amediocre location just so you canplay landlord. If you want to buy property, there are other residential investments youcan explore. If the practice isn'tmaking money within a few years, youwill simply end up selling the propertyand moving to a better location forlease \u2014 probably at a loss. If you own the property you practice at, one scenario to considerat retirement time could be to sellthe practice but retain ownership ofthe real estate. This will provide a good source of reliable income for a long, long timeto come.

After all, what hope has a confused chiropractor faced with withholding on so-called \"supplemental wages\" paid by his or her practice?\" What about withholding payrolltaxes when a worker's status changes from \"independentcontractor\" to employee? More importantly, how can youhope to avoid or minimize those almost inevitable payrolltax penalties? Employer-paid taxes You as an employer are required to withhold and payemployment taxes but, what are they? Medicare and Social Security (FICA): You pay half, and withhold the other half from the employee'spaycheck. Federal unemployment tax (FUTA): You must pay federal unemployment tax on the first $7,000 earned byeach employee. State unemployment tax: Like federal unemployment taxes, you, not employees, pay. Rates aregenerally based on a practice's location, size, and numberof employees. Supplemental wages: Such as commissions, draws, signing bonuses, severance pay, annual payments ofvacation and sick leave, paid at fixed intervals, sick pay ata different rate than regular pay, and lump-sum paymentsof accumulated annual leave.Sidestepping payroll tax penalties CHEC_62.ps PM Page CTOBER 28, 2009 WWW .CHIRO ECO.COM CHIROPRACTIC ECONOMICS 63 New rules for withholding on supplemental wages Before the IRS's new guidelines, employers electing to use the flat rate of withholding for supplemental wage payments withheld at the third lowest tax rate for singlefilers, i.e., 25 percent. That rate applied to the entirepayment regardless of amount. However, if a supplemental wage payment, when added to all other supplemental wage payments previously madeby you during the calendar year exceeds $1 million, theexcess is subject to mandatory withholding at the highestincome tax rate effective for that year, i.e. 35 percent. Beware According to recent reports, approximately 30 percent of IRS audits focus on the employee vs. independentcontractor issue. The IRS may further review a personalincome tax return, which over a period of several yearshas included only Form 1099 source income. Although reclassification of a worker most often occurs after an audit, the worker or you can ask the IRS todetermine whether the worker is an employee or anonemployee for federal employment tax purposes. Thetax laws provide a lower federal employment tax rates forprior years in which workers have been reclassified asemployees. The tax law prescribes reduced tax rates for misclassified workers in order to increase tax compliance.The law reduces your federal income tax withholdingliability from the amount you are required to withhold to1.5 percent of the employee's wages for federal income taxwithholding. The law also reduces your liability for theemployee's portion of FICA taxes to 20 percent of thenormal amount. According to the IRS, the reduced rates are only for prior years' liabilities attributable to reclassified workers. Ifyou fail to deduct and withhold employment taxes duringthe current calendar year because you thought the workerwas an independent contractor and discovered such errorduring the year, you can remedy the withholding failurebefore the calendar year ends. Employment tax adjustments The IRS has issued regulations that modify the process for making interest-free adjustments for underpaymentsand overpayments of the Federal Insurance ContributionCHEC_63.ps O CTOBER 28, 2009finances Act (FICA) and federal income tax withholding. When you discover an employment tax return filed with less than thecorrect amount of employees or yourportions of FICA or RRTA tax, youshould adjust the resultingunderpayment of tax by reporting theadditional amount due on an adjustedreturn for the return period. Unfortunately, the adjustment must be made by the due date of thereturn for the return period in whichthe error was discovered. Naturally, the underpayment amount must be paid at the time ofthe adjustment, or interest will beginto accrue from that date. The taxregulations do not, however, requireyou to repay or reimburse theemployee. On the other hand, the tax regulations also set out the procedurefor filing a refund claim for anoverpayment of FICA or RRTA tax.Naturally, you must certify that youhave repaid or reimbursed theemployee's share of FICA or RRTAtax to the employee or have securedthe written consent of the employeeto allowance of the refund or credit. Responsible parties There are civil penalties for those who fail to make proper or timelypayments and deposits. For anywillful failure to withhold or payemployment taxes, penalties andcriminal sanctions may apply. Beware however, once the IRS has levied a payroll tax penalty, they cantake action against the personal assetsof any or all \"responsible parties.\" In other words, if unpaid trust fund recovery penalties \u2014 or theemployment taxes themselves \u2014cannot be immediately collectedfrom the practice, the IRS canattempt to collect from a so-called\"responsible person.\" A responsible person is a person or a group who has the duty to performand the power to direct thecollecting, accounting, and paying oftrust fund taxes, such as: An officer or employee of a corporation; A member or employee of a partnership; A corporate director or shareholder; Another person with authority and control over funds to directtheir disbursement; or Another corporation. Reducing payroll tax penalties Obviously, payroll tax penalties can be devastating. A payroll penalty usually hits practices and businessesthat can least afford them, newbusinesses with weak cash flow,troubled practices, and those thathave suffered a casualty. Fortunately, there are steps you can CHEC_64.ps 10/12/09 1:39 PM Page 64CHEC_65.ps I SSUE 17 O CTOBER 28, 2009finances do to reduce a payroll tax penalty. The first thing to do is ask the IRS to abate (eliminate) the payroll tax penalty. This is a feasible strategy ifthe underpayment of the payroll taxdeposit is the exception, not the rule. Generally, the penalty is abated if a taxpayer: Provides proof of timely payment; Revised its Form 941, Schedule B, Report of tax liability forSemiweekly ScheduleDepositors; Makes a deposit redesignation; or Has reasonable cause for abating his penalty. A chiropractic practice with a good compliance history has\"reasonable cause\" for abating apenalty. A \"good compliance history\"means the practice has not been hitwith a penalty for the threeconsecutive preceding years (up to12 quarters for Form 941 filers). Ataxpayer with a good compliancehistory does not need any additionalexplanation for requesting abatementof the tax deposit penalties. Naturally, the IRS will still consider abatement of the penaltiesin situations where the practice'scompliance history is not totallyclean. Other examples of what theIRS might consider \"reasonablecause\" include: The death or severe illness of the practice's principal; The unavoidable absence of the principal; The destruction of the taxpayer's place of business; and Civil disturbances impairing the practice's ability to make deposits. In the end Payroll tax penalties can be avoided by making sure allemployment taxes are collected,accounted for, and paid to the IRSwhen required. Reducing payroll taxpenalties begins with asking the IRSto abate or eliminate the payroll taxpenalty. This is feasible if theunderpayment of the payroll taxdeposit is the exception, not the rule. Obviously, it also helps to understand the rules for withholdingemployment taxes on those so-called\"supplemental wages,\" as well as thebasic rules for withholding payrolltaxes \u2014 and paying over withheldamounts \u2014 on the wages of allemployees in the chiropracticpractice.

Submit your event dates at I SSUE 17 O CTOBER 28, 2009It's a tragic fact that most chiropractic colleges equip studentswith incredible healing skills, but devote little attention to the mechanicsof how students can utilize thesevaluable skills to attract patients. The student is often left with one of four choices: 1. Starting from scratch. The most difficult, yet most fulfilling, approach is to graduate and start a practice on your own. Make sure you have the money to buy or leaseequipment and the small business experience to promoteand market it. 2. Associate. This form of indentured servitude can be a humbling but powerful learning experience if you hookup with the right doctor with the right intent. It's a greatway to learn how a practice actually works and evencreate an opportunity to buy all or a portion of thepractice. 3. Buy out. A retiring doctor or one who simply enjoys the startup phase of practice can be an excellent solution,especially if he'll carry the paper. Be careful you don'tallow too much value to be placed on the 3,000 inactivepatient files left over from the insurance era, and demandat least a 30-day transition period.4. Plan B. Put your dreams on hold by selling shoes, delivering pizza, or getting out of chiropractic altogether.This is the tragic result of many colleges allowing facultymembers to scare students or not adequately prepare themfor the realities of having a practice. Ideas for a successful launch If you have graduated, or will soon graduate, and you're anxious to have the practice of your dreams, considersome of these ideas for a successful launch. Practice in your hometown. Give yourself the advantage of knowing the territory where you practice bystarting near where you grew up. Sure, some may not think of you as a doctor because they remember you growing up, but at least you'll havesome acquaintances to help jump-start your practice. If you grew up in a big city and think starting a practice in Bluefish, Mont., is going to be easy becausethere aren't any chiropractors within a 200-miles radius,think again! Clarify what business you're in. Make sure you know what business you're in. You may practice chiropractic,but that doesn't necessarily mean you're in thechiropractic business \u2014 or even the health business,although your intent may be to help restore the health ofyour patients.

Many new chiropractors seem to believe their youthfulness is a disadvantage. Far from it. You offer several advantages over establishedchiropractic doctors. First, you can claim to offer state-of-the-art chiropractic. Not the \"old school\" chiropractic the publicmay have heard about. Second, you can offer immediate openings for new patients. As you establish your practice, new patients canbe seen the same day they call. And finally, since you're new in practice, you can afford to offer the pampered care today's patients want. \"I'll treatyou like a person and not a number or a statistic.\" Youoffer some strategic advantages because you're new, usethem. Become visible. In the final analysis, unless you have a huge war chest for advertising, getting the new patientsnecessary to sustain a profitable business is largely aboutencountering as many strangers as possible. If you're a shy introvert, either build up the necessary scar tissue by confronting your fear or look for apermanent position as an associate, a teacher, or a behind-the-scenes researcher. Delivering chiropractic care works best when the practitioner enjoys the variety and unpredictability ofhuman interactions. Introduce yourself to strangers. Join a civic group or organization whose cause you believe in. Volunteer for jobs nobody wants. Introduce yourself to other small businesses in the vicinity of your practice.Become \"aggressively friendly.\" And always carry plenty ofbusiness cards and visualize the goal of getting rid of atleast five of them every day. Use the Internet. Get your Web site up as soon as possible. Not necessarily in the hopes that a potentialpatient will find you via a search engine by plugging inthe word \"chiropractor\" and the name of the town youpractice in, although that might happen. Instead, point to your Web site in all of your practice marketing efforts. Use it as a way to calm apprehensiveprospective patients and answer questions withoutactually having to show up in your office. Creating and maintaining a Web site is pretty easy these days and very affordable. William D.
