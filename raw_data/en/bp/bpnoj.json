Box 2448, Richmond, Virginia 23218-2448 5Deloitte Consulting LLP, 555 W 5th St #2700, Los Angeles, CA 90013 Abstract The deployment of vaccines across the US provides signifi- cant defense against serious illness and death from COVID- 19. Over 70% of vaccine-eligible Americans are at least par- tially vaccinated, but there are pockets of the population that are under-vaccinated, such as in rural areas and some de- mographic groups (e.g. age, race, ethnicity). These pockets are extremely susceptible to the Delta variant, exacerbating the healthcare crisis and increasing the risk of new variants. In this paper, we describe a data-driven model that provides real-time support to Virginia public health officials by recom- mending mobile vaccination site placement in order to target under-vaccinated populations. Our strategy uses fine-grained mobility data, along with US Census and vaccination uptake data, to identify locations that are most likely to be visited by unvaccinated individuals. We further extend our model to choose locations that maximize vaccine uptake among hes- itant groups. We show that the top recommended sites vary substantially across some demographics, demonstrating the value of developing customized recommendation models that integrate fine-grained, heterogeneous data sources. We also validate our recommendations by analyzing the success rates of deployed vaccine sites, and show that sites placed closer to our recommended areas administered higher numbers of doses. Our model is the first of its kind to consider evolving mobility patterns in real-time for suggesting placement strate- gies customized for different targeted demographic groups. 1 Introduction As of August 2, 2021, at least 70% of American adults aged 18 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine (Reuters 2021). However, in many subpopulations, including young people, Black people, people of Latinx eth- nicity, and in rural areas, the vaccination rate runs far be- low that (UCSF 2021; PBS 2021). Strategies have been de- vised to address vaccine accessibility - free child care, paid time off for employees, and other financial incentives - but these measures have not proven effective for these under- vaccinated demographic groups. In order to increase the rate of vaccination among the under-vaccinated or less vaccine-enthusiastic populations, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) has begun de- ployment of mobile vaccine distribution sites.

When VDH started this program, deploy- ment was driven primarily by intuition or educated guesses by local public health officials. However, two important fac- tors were not well-addressed in this deployment strategy: ( i) each demographic group has its own mobility patterns ; and (ii) mobility patterns have been evolving as the lockdown has eased. Therefore, a more methodical, real-time deploy- ment plan was needed to address these deficits. The success of mobile site placements depends on ( i) the accessibility of these sites for the target populations, and ( ii) their willingness to get vaccinated ( acceptance/hesitancy ). To address the accessibility aspect, we propose that areas with high foot traffic from the target demographic groups would be productive locations to place mobile vaccination units. To this end, we employ a dynamic ,data-driven rec- ommendation model, using heterogeneous data sources, that can recommend locations with high probability of vaccina- tion uptake success in real-time . Our model works as follows. First , it uses aggregated and anonymized mobility data from SafeGraph to identify ar- eas with high mobility concentrations and the Census Block Groups (CBGs) that contribute to that traffic. Such data has been used extensively as a means to study the spread of COVID-19 and to track the degree of compliance with so- cial distancing directives (Badr et al. 2020; Buckee et al. 2020; Warren and Skillman 2020; Wellenius et al. 2020; Chang et al. 2021a; Wang et al. 2020). The candidate areas are defined as tessellations indexed by Google's S2 Geome- try.Second , it leverages multiple data sources containing the demographic profile of each CBG to adjust the previously computed mobility for target demographic groups using a set of equations. Based on this adjusted mobility, it ranks the tessellations separately for each group. Third , it is equipped with a module to estimate vaccine acceptance across differ- ent demographic groups to refine the previous rankings. Overall, our model can be described as a rule-based sys- tem which consists of a set of rules (equations) used to pro- cess the heterogeneous knowledge graph data sources (Safe- Graph + Census data) and takes subsequent actions (recom- mendations). The model also champions fairness and equity,which are lingering issues in AI. Machine learning models can suffer from bias, serving certain demographic groups better than others (Sweeney et al. 2019), but our model mit- igates this issue by employing the rules after taking into ac- count the racial heterogeneity of CBGs. To evaluate how our placement strategy compared with actual placements made by public health officials, we review existing mobile distribution site placements from VDH- provided data and observe vaccines administered at these locations. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of our model for various demographic groups and different weeks. In line with the continuing support our group has provided to various local, state, and federal public health authorities since the onset of the pandemic, we presented two proto- types of our model to VDH and received valuable guidance integral to the current implementation of our model and the selection of demographic groups for deployment. Our model has been operational since the beginning of June 2021, con- tinuously providing real-time placement recommendations. Although we have not received quantifiable data reflecting the effectiveness of these sites, VDH does rely on these rec- ommendations for mobile vaccination site planning. Fran- cisco Diaz, the Vaccine Administration Support Supervisor for VDH, has stated that this program allows VDH to iden- tify where vaccines are needed. This improves their ability to focus their efforts on reaching target demographic groups in locations that are accessible and convenient to them. His complete statement is available at (Diaz 2021). Our work is the first of its kind to develop a data-driven model that considers evolving mobility patterns and finds a real-time placement strategy that is accessible to different targeted demographic groups. Through its simplicity and interpretability, our model also outshines difficult-to-solve location-theory algorithms and hard-to-interpret deep learn- ing models, something that is sought by policymakers due to its safety-critical use case. From this aspect, our model ad- vocates interpretable AI. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. We describe similar previous works relying on mobility data in Section 2. In Section 3, we describe the incremental design and imple- mentation of our model to create a ranking of areas for place- ment of vaccine distribution sites. Salient insights about mo- bility of different demographic groups and comparison be- tween our recommendations and existing sites are presented in Section 4. Lastly, we explore the utility and implications of our model in Section 5. 2 Related Work Mobility and Vaccination A first set of works (Salda na et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2021; Buckner et al. 2021; Jentsch et al. 2021) simulated different vaccination strategies for various scenarios and studied their effectiveness. (Jentsch et al. 2021) found that if there is a delay in vaccine avail- ability, it is more effective to target individuals with high social contact instead of focusing on the elderly; (Chen et al. 2021) reached similar conclusions, except they com- pared between high contact people and essential workers. (Salda na et al. 2021) evaluated the effectiveness of differ- ent vaccination strategies by simulating a meta-populationmodel across several scenarios. (Buckner et al. 2021) used a mathematical model that indicated that the prioritization strategy should vary depending on the objective; for exam- ple, targeting essential workers minimizes infection, but tar- geting older individuals minimizes the number of deaths. In terms of vaccination, these works focus mainly on who but notwhere , whereas in our work we focus on both aspects. COVID-19 systems to aid policymakers Similar to how our system is designed to provide data-driven, real-time sup- port to policymakers, quite a few systems have been devel- oped to aid policymakers during the pandemic. Some were designed for surveillance purposes, e.g. visualizing infection rates and trends at different spatial resolutions (Dong et al. 2020; Peddireddy et al. 2020; Wissel et al. 2020), identify- ing anomalous hotspots (Hohl et al. 2020), and informing policymakers about the necessary levels of restriction in a timely fashion (Qiu 2021). Another set of systems was de- veloped to help policymakers observe the effects of differ- ent non-pharmaceutical interventions in order to help them make informed decisions (Barrett et al. 2007; Beckman et al. 2014; Chang et al. 2021b). What sets our work apart is that we are the first to develop an operational system that provides weekly updates to poli- cymakers regarding placement strategies for mobile vaccine distribution sites across different demographic groups. Also, unlike other systems which largely focus on surveillance and retrospective analyses, our system provides real-time sup- port to policymakers for mitigating disease transmission. 3 Methodology 3.1 Datasets Fine-grained mobility data (SafeGraph) Mobility data can reveal important information about populations, such as where people are visiting and how this behavior evolves over time. For our model, we use anonymized and aggre- gated data from SafeGraph (SafeGraph 2018). It provides detailed information about non-residential locations visited by individuals (e.g. grocery stores, parks), also referred to aspoints of interest (POIs). SafeGraph's Weekly Patterns dataset1, released on Wednesdays with the data for the pre- vious week (Monday through Sunday), includes weekly es- timates of visits from CBGs to these POIs. The dataset can be naturally viewed as a bipartite graph, as described later in 3.3. For our work here, we focus on POIs and CBGs in the Commonwealth of Virginia, where visits from 5,293 CBGs to 74,535 POIs were compiled in the latest release. However, SafeGraph has some limitations. For instance, it does not cover all POIs or populations (e.g., children). Fur- thermore, depending on the number of devices carried by a user, visits may be underreported or overreported. The GPS signal itself can also be noisy. We describe how we account for some of these limitations in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. Demographic Data As the SafeGraph dataset does not in- clude demographic information, we use demographic data from the US Census American Community Survey (ACS) in conjunction with the visits from the CBGs to population per CBGDemographic inference Census tract vaccinationSynthetic Population Data Sources SafeGraph ACS CensusSynthetic data from BII Vaccination Data from VDHGroup L14 cells ranked by importance for May 2021 (Present) Weekly delivery process Wednesday 6pm (for previous week) POI Address and lat/long Wednesday 6pm (for previous week) CSV files containing top 25 recommended cells for each VDH HTML Maps showing locations of the recommended cellsVDH Deliverables (via Box) Thursday by 12pmNo set schedule for data updates.DeliveryStep 1Step 2 Step 3 Step 4 visit count each county(a) Data-to-deployment pipeline.

The pipeline is run weekly on Wednesdays with the updated SafeGraph data. Sample HTML deliverables generated by the model are shown for Danville City for the week of June 21-June 27 for two demographic groups (1b,1c). The deliverables to VDH are generated by noon on Thursday. The 2015-2019 release of the 5-year Census data contains the population breakdown in each CBG by different demo- graphic groups (e.g. Black, Latinx). This adapts our model to estimate visits from each demographic group to each POI, or which POIs are frequented by each group. Although the census data provides numbers for individual demographics, such as race or age group, it does not include fine-grained information about combined demographics. We describe our approach for handling combined demographics in the extended version of this paper (Mehrab et al. 2021). Vaccination Data Our final dataset, obtained from VDH, contains the number of individuals per census tract who have received vaccine doses. However, SafeGraph and ACS Cen- sus data are provided at the CBG level. In order to maintain the same level of resolution across all data sources, we es- timate the number of unvaccinated individuals at the CBG level, assuming that the number of doses in a census tract is distributed proportionately across its underlying CBGs. 3.2 S2 Geometry Although SafeGraph provides the number of visits to spe- cific POIs, the resolution level is quite dense for calculating the placement of mobile vaccination sites. Furthermore, the signals picked up for a specific POI do not necessarily indi- cate that the device was present in that specific POI at that time of collection due to the noise associated with Global Positioning Systems (GPS) signals. In order to address these issues, instead of considering individual POIs with high foot traffic for potential site placement, we identify geographical areas with high foot traffic as follows. ( i) We divide each county in Virginia into much smaller areas , each of which contains a group of POIs. ( ii) For each area, we aggregate the foot traffic for all of the POIs in that area, then rank each area inside a region based on this aggregated foot traffic. To partition Virginia into regions, we use Google's S2 ge-ometry2, which divides the world map into nested cells of decreasing size (L0 - L30). Level L0 is one cell representing the entire map; it contains 4 L1 cells, each of which contains 4 L2 cells, each of which contains 4 L3 cells, and so on. 3.3 Placement model Our data-driven model was guided by two preceding proof- of-concept prototypes, described in more detail in the ex- tended version of this paper (Mehrab et al. 2021). Lessons learned from these prototypes helped shape our final model, which is described below. Mobility Network: One input to our placement model is a dynamic mobility network which can be represented as a bipartite graph G(V, E ), where Vis the set of nodes and Eis the set of time-varying edges. Vis the union of two disjoint sets C={c1, ..., c m}andP={P1, ..., P n}. Here Crepresents the set of CBGs, and Pis the set of POIs in the dataset. Each edge (ci, pj)is associated with a weight wt ij, the number of people from civisiting pjat time t. LetD={d1, d2, ...}be a set of demographic groups of interest. Each CBG ciis associated with its overall popula- tionNiand the population Nk i, which is specific to demo- graphic group dk(where dkD). Each CBG ciis also associated with Mi, the number of mobile devices from ci captured by SafeGraph. Subsequently, each POI pjis also associated with a small geographic area denoted by Sjand a large region indicated by Lj. In our final model described below, each small geographic area is an L14 cell of Google's S2 geometry as described in Section 3.2 and each large re- gion is a county. Therefore, we use these notations for denot- ing the L14 cell and county also in subsequent paragraphs. Our placement model takes the dynamic bipartite graph generated from SafeGraph and a set of demographic groups of interest, and generates as output a ranked list of areas as 2https://s2geometry.io/potential candidates for setting up mobile vaccination units within each larger region. This is performed as follows: 1. First, we adjust the weights along the edges of the graph to estimate the number of actual visits to each POI to mitigate the under-reporting issue discussed in 3.1. Due to this issue, the actual number of visits is higher than the reported number of visits. This issue is addressed by upweighting the visits along each edge as : Ut ij=wt ijNi Mi 2. Second, we adjust the weights for each demographic group dkby obtaining an apportioned estimate of how many people of that group from CBG civisited a POI pj. In other words, we apportion the visit along the edge for a particular demographic dkas :Atk ij=Ut ijNk i Ni 3. Third, each area (L14 cell) within a region (county) is ranked based on the apportioned visits to the POIs within that cell. Let S={s1, s2, ...}be the set of all distinct ar- eas. Then, we aggregate the apportioned number of visits to the POIs of a particular L14 cell sLand calculate its visit count at time tfor a particular demographic group dkas:I(sL, ciCAtk ij1sL(Sj) where 1sL(Sj)is1when 0 we group each area (L14 cell) Sjby their cor- responding region (county) Lj, then sort by their visit counts . For each county, the 25 top-ranked areas are re- ported as candidate sites. The conceptual pipeline for the model is presented in Figure 1a. 3.4 Demographic Acceptance/Hesitancy Even if vaccination units are placed in easily accessible locations, some individuals may be unwilling or afraid to get vaccinated (CNN 2021; PBS 2021). We employ a simulation-based approach to infer hesitancy levels of dif- ferent demographic groups at the county level; this approach is described in the extended version of this paper (Mehrab et al. 2021). After the simulation, for each timestamp t, each CBG Ciand a demographic group d, we have the popula- tion count, number of individuals who had at least one dose of vaccine Vt id, and the estimated number of hesitant indi- viduals as per the calibrated model Ht id. In this section, we describe how we incorporate these values into our model. Overcoming the hesitancy threshold in areas where vac- cine acceptance is low can be a challenge; for this reason, placing mobile sites in these areas may not be the best strat- egy for maximizing uptake. However, hesitant people may be influenced to take the vaccine if they see their peers get- ting vaccinated (i.e. peer pressure). Therefore, our approach is to improve accessibility to the vaccine-accepting in areas that may also be frequented by the hesitant. Our method to update the apportioned value in Step 2 of Section 3.3 using this new dataset is described as follows: 1. We still pick locations with high foot traffic (emphasis on the original value of the apportioned visits At ij) 2. We also give higher priority to areas with greater num- bers of unvaccinated individuals. 3. If vaccine-hesitant people can be influenced by peer pres- sure, then we want to lower priority in areas where most of the unvaccinated are hesitant.Based on this, we calculate an updated apportioned weight At ijby incorporating hesitancy data from the origi- nal apportioned weight At ijas:At ij=At ijRt idXt id Here, Rt idis the ratio of the unvaccinated individuals to the total population of demographic group din CBG Ciat timet.Xt idis the ratio of vaccine-accepting individuals to vaccine-hesitant individuals in the population. Updating the apportioned weight in this approach ensures that places with high mobility are still given importance At ij, priority is reduced for CBGs where a majority of the popula- tion is vaccinated Rt id, and a good balance between accept- ing and hesitant populations is maintained. 3.5 Implementation Due to the large volume of the SafeGraph Weekly Patterns data, upweight andapportion are done on separate chunks of the complete dataset in parallel jobs. We also filter out CBGs and POIs outside of Virginia and associate the re- maining POIs with an L14 cell during this step. Afterwards, the output from each parallel job is concatenated into a sin- gle dataset, and the visit counts to each POI are aggregated by their corresponding L14 cells. Then, we generate a CSV file for each demographic group containing the S2 identifier of each L14 cell, latitude and longitude of the centroid of that cell, and its visit count. The L14 cells are ranked based on their visit count for each county. The top 25 cell loca- tions per county are also shown in HTML maps, one for each demographic group, for ease of visualization. In Figure 1b and 1c, we display sample HTMLs generated by our model for the week of June 21 - June 27 showing some of the rec- ommended locations for the deployment of mobile vaccina- tion sites in Danville City for two demographic groups. Our model is operationalized to deliver these CSV and HTML files to VDH weekly, which they are using currently to target the 10 health districts with the lowest vaccination rates. Based on guidance from VDH, we are currently deliv- ering recommendations for the target demographic groups Ethnicity Latinx (L), Race Black (B), and populations within the ages of 20 to 39 (A1), 20 to 29 (A2), and 30 to 39 (A3). We also use cumulative vaccination data from VDH to gen- erate recommendations targeting unvaccinated (U) people. These, along with the population group \"Whole population\" (W) which considers foot traffic only, means we deliver rec- ommendations for a total of seven population groups. 4 Analysis 4.1 Comparison of model recommendations across demographics and temporality This section presents some key insights obtained from anal- yses of our model output conducted at state level and across each health district. Detailed discussion on these results are covered in the extended version (Mehrab et al. 2021). First, we present comparative analyses across different demographic groups at the state level. Figure 2a tabulates the number of common recommendations across the top 25 rec- ommended sites in Virginia for pairs of demographic groups for the week of July 19 - July 25. We observe only two common recommended areas between LandB, indicating(a) Number of common areas. (b) AMD (km). Figure 2: Statewide comparison of recommended places across demographic groups for the July 28 delivery. that frequently visited locations by these two demographic groups differ quite a bit. We also find that the locations fre- quented by Bare quite different compared to those of the other demographic groups. Therefore, it is worthwhile to consider customized recommendations for different groups. Over the course of our weekly deliveries to VDH, we also noticed that recommended sites varied across different weeks. Figure 3a and 3b show variations for the top 25 rec- ommended areas over a two-month delivery period for de- mographic groups WandL, respectively. Interestingly, the recommended areas are largely similar for the four weeks of June, then again across the four weeks of July. But if we compare any week in June to any week in July, the recom- mendations differ significantly. This suggests that mobility patterns changed after June going into the month of July. The state of emergency mandated by Virginia ending on June 30 may be a possible cause for this change in mobility pattern. Upon further study, we found that the \"different\" L14 cells often shared a border, suggesting that aggregated foot traffic in those cells came from adjacent POIs. Therefore, instead of looking at common areas, we examined how far apart highly-ranked areas were relative to each other by cal- culating the average minimum distance (AMD) between two sets of areas. The two sets can either be the top 25 areas for two groups in a week or the top 25 areas for two different weeks for a particular group, depending upon the analysis involved. We calculated AMD by matching each area in one set with its closest area in other set and taking average haver- sine distance of the matched areas based on their centroids. We find that while the monthly pattern is still observable forW(Figure 3c), it is not the case for L(Figure 3d). This is contrary to the similarity observed in Figure 3a and Fig- ure 3b. Furthermore, the AMD between areas are quite con- centrated for Lin Figure 3d while the AMD is high between areas recommended for Land other demographic groups (Figure 2b). This indicates that while the frequently visited locations by Latinx individuals are comparatively far away from other demographic groups, the locations themselves visited by Latinx individuals remain relatively close to each other across different weeks. 4.2 Acceptance/Hesitancy In this section, we analyze the effect of incorporating hes- itancy into our model by examining the recommended mo- bile site placements for BandL. We refer to our base modelasMBand the hesitancy-incorporated model as MH. First, we observe the number of common recommenda- tions between the two implementations of the model, MB andMH. We compare from the top 1 to the top 100 areas recommended by both models and find there are more differ- ences across the models between the recommended areas for the group Bthan group L(left y-axis of Figure 4a). For ex- ample, MBandMHhave only two common areas between their recommended top 25 areas for group B, while there are 17 common areas for L. This indicates that many of the ar- eas recommended by the base model for the Black race see high percentages of vaccine-hesitant individuals, while this phenomenon is less evident for the Latinx ethnicity group. To explore this further, we looked at the AMD of the two sets of recommended areas considering from the top 1 to top 100 areas. We see that the two top areas for Bin the two models are highly disparate (right y-axis of Figure 4a). For example, the top recommended area by MBis in Vir- ginia Beach, whereas the top recommended area by MHis in Stafford, which is about 200km from Virginia Beach. Finally, we visualize the top 100 areas recommended by both models on a map. For B, we see that while many areas in the southern part of Virginia are recommended by MB, the areas recommended by MHare mostly concentrated within the Central and Northern parts of Virginia. It is also interesting that MHdoes not recommend any area in Vir- ginia Beach even within its top 100 recommendations, while the area was recommended highly by MB(Figure 4). The model is much less sensitive to the Ethnicity Latinx group, as the map tells us that the recommended areas are mostly the same in both versions of the model (Figure 4c). 4.3 Validation study The absence of ground truth data about the accessibility of our recommended areas made the evaluation of our strategy a bit involved. However, VDH provided a list of 147 mo- bile sites deployed from May 19 to June 30, and the num- ber of daily doses administered at those sites, which we used to retrospectively analyze the effectiveness of our strat- egy. We looked at the corroboration of our recommenda- tions with these deployed sites using the recommendations forBover the month of June. The results were also similar forL, which we show in the extended version (Mehrab et al. 2021). Specifically, for each deployed site, we looked at our closest recommended area and found that most of the de- ployed sites were within 1km of at least one of our recom- mended areas, suggesting that either our placement strategy led to selection of these sites, or the original selection strat- egy and our strategy corroborated each other to some extent. To evaluate the effectiveness of these conforming sites with respect to vaccine administration, we compared the sites within 1km of at least one of our recommended ar- eas with the remaining sites in terms of doses administered. We find that, in general, sites close to our recommended ar- eas administered higher numbers of doses on average. (Fig- ure 5b). This indicates that our recommended areas are in- deed more accessible, and it is probable that using our place- ment strategy could help policymakers to increase uptake among targeted demographic groups.(a) Number of common areas across delivery weeks for W.

Figure 5: Effectiveness of our placement strategy. 5 Discussion In this work, we have devised a data-driven, equity support- ive, dynamic, rule-based recommendation model for the so- cial good that considers evolving mobility patterns to find a real-time placement strategy for making vaccines more ac- cessible to targeted demographic groups. This model has been operational since early June 2021, and, since then, we have delivered mobile vaccination recommendations to VDH every week. Our strategy is simple and transparent, yet effective. There are some additional takeaways from this ex- perience that are worth noting, however. First , the target demographic groups are divergent in their mobility, alluding to the necessity of a targeted ranking of locations. Similarly, depending on the target group, con- sidering hesitancy may be necessary. Second , trends at the state level do not carry through at finer resolutions. Third , while mobility may differ across demographic groups, it stays comparatively stable over time for a particular group.Fourth , although our research focuses on the Common- wealth of Virginia, this approach can be generalized for any other US state, which we leave as future work. There are some limitations to our work. The absence of data made it difficult to validate our work against actual vac- cination rates at the recommended sites; however, our site recommendations compared favorably with the sites placed by VDH where data was available. Our model also assumes that people from a given CBG who frequent these L14 loca- tions are demographically similar to the population of that CBG; this may not hold true in all cases. In the future, we want to factor this into our model by taking into consider- ation that the mobility of a particular demographic group from a CBG to a POI not only depends on the demographic distribution of the CBG, but also the category of the POI.
