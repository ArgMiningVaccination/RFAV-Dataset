This article discusses the differences between an acupuncturist and a chiropractor to help you get the best treatment for your symptoms. Who is a Chiropractor? A chiropractor is a healthcare professional who diagnoses and treats neuromuscular disorders through spinal manipulation and adjustments. Not only does a chiropractor provide pain relief, but also improves functionality and educates their patients on preventive care measures. Chiropractors believe there is an intimate relationship between the spine and the nervous system. This means that the nervous system can be affected by structural and biomechanical derangement of the spine. Chiropractic treatment can ease pressure on compressed nerves and restore balance and coordination between the spine and the nervous system. Not only does this help with pain relief but also improves the overall health of the individual. Who is an Acupuncturist? An acupuncturist is a healthcare professional who uses traditional Chinese Medicine to evaluate and treat pain or illnesses. They are educated to treat a wide range of health conditions including pain management, sports injury, and maintaining overall health and wellness. Acupuncturists primarily use thin needles that are inserted at specific points around the body to treat pain. They can also use blood moving approaches, massage, and polarity devices to promote self-healing and wellness. Acupuncturists establish an electromagnetic gradient along acupoints to facilitate the flow of energy (Qi) along the meridian pathways in our body. Major Differences between an Acupuncturist and a Chiropractor - Knowledge and Experience Chiropractors study human anatomy, diagnostic imaging, nutrition, orthopedics, and laboratory procedures. They are trained to perform joint adjustments and spinal manipulation to restore normal body functions and processes. Chiropractors also provide patient education on exercise, diet, rehabilitation, and lifestyle modification. Acupuncturists are generally trained in acupuncture rather than the full system of oriental medicine. However, they receive training in conventional topics such as anatomy, herbology, nutrition, and other areas of traditional oriental medicine. - Approaches to Treatment A chiropractor maintains the alignment in your spine to ease the pressure on the nerves so that your body can start the healing process. The approaches used in chiropractic care include manual soft tissue therapy, spinal traction, nutritional counseling, therapeutic exercises, and lifestyle modification. An acupuncturist uses theoretical knowledge of the body's energy and blood flow to promote self-healing and pain relief. An acupuncturist administers treatment through the help of needle insertions, polarity devices, massage, and blood moving approaches. - Scope of Treatment Chiropractors focus primarily on the spine, and the way tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints affect the communication between the brain and the nervous system. These adjustments stimulate the nerves surrounding the targeted area, which help restore normal body function and processes. Acupuncturists focus on the trigger points around the body where they insert sterile needles to clear energy blockages along the body's meridians. This helps to promote the normal flow of energy and blood that facilitates healing and overall wellness. Can You Visit Both an Acupuncturist and a Chiropractor? It is possible to see both a chiropractor and an acupuncturist as they provide useful health benefits for your body and wellbeing. You can visit a chiropractor to assess any misalignment in your spine and provide necessary adjustments to put you back in alignment. A chiropractor can also refer you to an acupuncturist for supplemental treatment. Acupuncture treatment works differently to help your body heal naturally.
