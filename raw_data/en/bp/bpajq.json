See below to read about the unique style and benefits of Japanese acupuncture, and to learn about the bodywork offered- Tui Na, cupping, Chi Nei Tsang (abdominal work), and gua sha. The Bodywork Tui Na - translated \"Push Pull\". Relaxing, rhythmic techniques preformed on fully clothed patient. Similar to traditional massage but the focus is on the meridian system, in addition to the musculoskeletal system. Cupping - Glass cups for musculoskeletal work and silicone cups for joints and soft tissue. Whereas massage uses compression, cupping creates a vacuum, brings oxygenated blood. If you like massage you'll like cupping. Chi Nei Tsang - Abdominal work centered around visceral (organ) manipulation. Developed by Taoists. Begins with the breath. Helpful for digestion, elimination and systemic detoxification. Gua Sha - Gentle stroking of the skin with a smooth edged tool such as a spoon or buffalo horn, breaks up stagnation and encourages circulation. Encourages lymphatic drainage. Helpful for neck and shoulder tension. Japanese Style Acupuncture Known for a focus on palpation. Personalized to the patient, not an academic picking of points. Immediately apparent diagnosis based off the hara (abdomen.) Gets to the root of the problem- is the patient stuck in fight or flight, are the adrenals in trouble, is there a structural issue, etc. Clinically effective. Japanese style requires classical training after the four year process of graduate school. Originally developed by the blind.
