Caring For Invisalign Aligners To care for your Invisalign aligners, it's crucial to clean them thoroughly to avoid plaque and bacterial accumulation. Failure to do so can lead to discoloration, odors, and oral health issues. Your aligners may also trap bacteria against your teeth, increasing the risk of cavities.

Why Use Invisalign Cleaning Crystals? Invisalign cleaning crystals are an important part of maintaining good oral hygiene when wearing Invisalign aligners. Here are some reasons why using them is useful: 1. Removes stubborn buildup: Over time, food particles and bacteria can accumulate on your Invisalign aligners, leading to stubborn buildup that can be difficult to remove. Invisalign cleaning crystals break down and remove this buildup and leave your aligners clean and fresh. 2. Prevents discoloration: If you don't clean your braces regularly, they can start to discolor and become noticeable in your mouth. Cleaning crystals are designed to prevent this discoloration and keep your aligners looking clear and invisible. 3. Helps prevent bad breath: Bacteria and food particles can also contribute to bad breath. By regularly cleaning your aligners with crystals, you can help prevent bad breath and keep your mouth feeling fresh. 4. Easy to use: Invisalign cleaning crystals are simple to use and don't require any special equipment. All you need to do is dissolve a packet of crystals in water and soak your aligners for 15 minutes. How To Use Cleaning Crystals One of the biggest benefits of using Invisalign cleaning crystals is that they are safe for daily use. They are made with non-toxic materials that break down plaque and bacteria without harming your aligners or your oral health. Plus, they are easy to use and fit perfectly into your daily oral care routine. To use them, simply follow these steps: - Rinse your aligners under running water to remove any food debris or saliva. - Dissolve a packet of Invisalign cleaning crystals in a clean glass of room-temperature water by stirring or shaking. - Fully submerge your aligners or retainers into the cleaning solution for 15 to 30 minutes. - After soaking, remove the aligners and rinse them under room temperature water. - Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently brush off any remaining plaque or build-up on the aligners. - Rinse the aligners under warm water to wash off the solution, and wash out the glass. - Repeat this process daily to keep your aligners clean and free of bacteria or discoloration.

Maintaining your Invisalign aligners is crucial for achieving the best possible results. Thankfully, using Invisalign cleaning crystals makes this task effortless and straightforward. But how often should you use these cleaning crystals? In your Invisalign welcome kit, you'll receive a few packets of cleaning crystals, which may not seem like enough initially. However, the good news is that you likely won't need to use them very often. One of the reasons for this is that you'll be switching to a new set of aligners every 7 to 14 days, Meaning that your current set of aligners won't have enough time to accumulate significant plaque or discoloration. However, if you end up wearing your current set of aligners for a more extended period, such as while you're waiting for your retainer to arrive, you may want to use a packet of cleaning crystals to give them a deeper clean. Following the best practices and guidelines provided by your orthodontist should be sufficient to keep your aligners stain-free and in top condition. Common Mistakes To Avoid When Using Invisalign Cleaning Crystals There are a few common mistakes that people make when using cleaning crystals and there can be some adverse effects as well when you do it wrongly. Using them isn't a typical task but knowing the common mistakes can save you some headache. Here are some of the most important things to keep in mind: 1. Not using them at all: One of the biggest mistakes you can make is not using the cleaning crystals at all. Your aligners need to be cleaned daily and using the crystals can help to ensure that they stay free from bacteria and stains. 2. Not dissolving the crystals properly: To get the most benefit from the cleaning crystals, it's important to dissolve them completely in water before adding your aligners. Failing to dissolve them properly can mean that they don't work as effectively. 3. Using hot water: Hot water can damage your aligners and cause them to warp or become misshapen. Stick to using room temperature water when dissolving the crystals. 4. Not soaking your aligners long enough: They need time to work their magic so make sure you're soaking your aligners for at least 15-30 minutes. Leaving them in for less time won't give the crystals enough time to abolish bacteria and plaque. 5. Brushing too hard: When you're using a toothbrush to clean your aligners after soaking them in the cleaning solution, be gentle. Brushing too hard can scratch the surface of your aligners, making them more prone to staining and damage. By avoiding these common mistakes and using Invisalign cleaning crystals correctly, you can help to keep your aligners in great condition and ensure that your smile stays healthy and bright throughout your treatment.
