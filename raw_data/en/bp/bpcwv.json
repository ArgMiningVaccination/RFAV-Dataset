Although, these viruses displa y similar sympt oms and the poten\u0000al to cause liver disease to varying degrees; they howeve r dier signicantly in regards to epidemiology, preven\u0000on, diagnosis, and care and treatmen t. Viral hepa \u0000\u0000s is a major global health problem with more than 400 million pa\u0000ents chronic ally infected, causing over 1.4 million deaths per year. Nigeria is among the countries with a high burden of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s with a Hepa \u0000\u0000s B Virus (FMOH 2013). Knowledg e of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s remains low among Nigerians despit e being a leading infec\u0000ous cause of death each year. As a consequence, mos t of the es\u0000ma ted 20 million Nigerians living with viral hepa \u0000\u0000s B or C are undiagnosed, increasing the likelihood of futur e transmission to other s and placing them at greater risk for severe, even fatal health complic a\u0000ons such as liver cirrhosis and liver cancer (hepa tocellular carcinoma). Some key subpopula \u0000ons, such as men who have sex with men (MSM) and people who inject drugs (PWID) have a high risk of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s infec\u0000on. Persons living with HIV tely aected by viral hepa \u0000\u0000s and related condi\u0000ons, considering 3 that HIV, HBV, and HCV shar e common modes of transmission. The progression of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s is acceler ated among persons with HIV; therefore, HIV co-infected persons experience greater liver- related health problems than non-HIV infected persons. Recipien ts of organs, blood, and \u0000ssue, along with persons working or receiving care in health se\u0000ngs con\u0000nue to be at risk for viral hepa \u0000\u0000s infec\u0000on as well. Nigeria is among c ountries with the highes t bur den of vir al hepa \u0000\u0000s with the pr evalence of HB V 11% and 2.2%, ely. The distribu\u0000on of HBV by sex is 62.6% of males and 37.4% of females, while the distribu\u0000on of HCV by sex is 52.4% to 47.6%. Infec\u0000ons are mos t common among 21-40 year olds, although substan\u0000al perina tal and childhood transmissions do occur . Medic al personnel, especially surgeons and den\u0000sts are at the greatest risk of infec\u0000on, while other healthc are workers, commer cial sex workers, and drivers are also at signic ant risk of infec\u0000on. In Nigeria, HBV transmission results in substan\u0000al morbidity and mort ality from chronic HBV, liver cirrhosis, and hepa tocellular carcinoma. Risk factors for transmission in Nigeria include sexual intercourse, local circumcision, local uvelect omy, scaric a\u0000on, tribal mark s, surgical procedur es, body piercing, home birth, and receipt of blood transfusions These are the rst edi\u0000on of the Feder al Minis try of Health guidelines for the preven\u0000on, care and treatmen t of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s especially B and C in Nigeria. These guidelines have been developed for use by policy mak ers, programme manag ers, and health-c are provider s at all levels of care in Nigeria. The developmen t of this documen t is aligned with the global principle of elimina \u0000ng viral hepa \u0000\u0000s th by 2030 which is in keeping with the Unit ed Na\u0000ons adop\u0000on during the 59 World Health Assembly in May 2016. The strategies and recommenda \u0000ons have been adopt ed based on the principle of achie ving univ Na\u0000onal Guidelines f or the Pr even\u0000on, Car e and T reatmen t of Vir al Hepa \u0000\u0000s in Nig eriaand human rights and equity .

The r ecommenda \u0000ons ar e structur ed along the c on\u0000nuum of c are for per sons with chr onic vir al hepa \u0000\u0000s B and C from ini\u0000al assessmen t of stage of disease and eligibility for treatmen t, to ini\u0000a \u0000on of rst-line an\u0000viral therapy and monit oring for disease progression, toxicity and hepa tocellular cell carcinoma and switch to second-line drugs in persons with treatmen t failur e especially in viral hepa \u0000\u0000s B and for viral hepa \u0000\u0000s C using an\u0000viral drugs. They are intended for use across age groups and adult popula \u0000ons. These guidelines are covered in seven (7) chapt ers. Chapt er 2 dealt with the manag emen t of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s B including preven\u0000on of perina tal and aected popula \u0000ons such as per sons who inject drugs, men who ha ve sex with men, and se x workers; as well as preven\u0000on of HBV transmission in health-c are se\u0000ngs. The use of alcohol reduc\u0000on interven\u0000ons to reduce progression of liver disease in those with CHB was also highligh ted. It also recommended the use of simple, non-in vasive diagnos \u0000c tests to assess the stage of liver disease and eligibility for treatmen t; priori\u0000z e treatmen t for those with mos t advanced liver disease and at greatest risk of mort ality; and recommend the preferred use of nucleos(t)ide analogues with a high barrier to drug resistance (tenof ovir and entecavir, and entecavir in years) for rst- and second-line treatmen t. These guidelines also recommend lifelong treatmen t in those with cirrhosis; and regular monit oring for disease progression, toxicity of drugs and early detec\u0000on of Hepa er 3 the manag emen t of hepa \u0000\u0000s C, The majority (80%) of HCV infec\u0000ons progresses to Chronic Liver Disease (CLD).

One in e very 12 per sons w orldwide is living with vir al hepa \u0000\u0000s; appr oxima tely 240 million persons are infected with chronic HBV and another 80 million , are infected with chronic HCV infec\u0000on. Globally , an es\u0000ma ted 7% of primar y liver cancer and 54% of liver cirrhosis cases are caused by viral hepa \u0000\u0000s, and appr oxima tely 1.4 million deaths from viral hepa \u0000\u0000s occur each year. The propor\u0000on of persons living with viral hepa \u0000\u0000s is greatest in Asia, sub-Sahar an Afric a, and Egypt.

The distribu\u0000on of HBV by sex is 62.6% of males and 37.4% of females, while the distribu\u0000on of HCV by sex is 52.4% to 47.6%. Infec\u0000ons are mos t common among 21-40 year olds, although substan\u0000al perina tal and childhood transmissions do occur . Medic al personnel, especially surgeons and den\u0000sts are at the greatest risk of infec\u0000on, while other healthc are workers, commer cial sex workers, and drivers are also at signic ant risk of infec\u0000on. In Nigeria, HBV transmission results in substan\u0000al morbidity and mort ality from chronic HBV, liver cirrhosis, and hepa tocellular carcinoma. Risk factors for transmission specic to Nigeria include local circumcision, local uvelect omy, scaric a\u0000on, tribal mark s, surgical procedur es, body piercing, home birth, and receipt of blood transfusions. 1.2.2 Viral Hepa\u0000\u0000s subtypes Viral Hepa \u0000\u0000s has ve major types- A, B, C, D and E, with varying degr ees of epidemiology , preven\u0000on, diagnosis and treatmen t. Hepa \u0000\u0000s A Virus (HAV), which is primarily spread via faecal-or al transmission, causes Hepa \u0000\u0000s A infec\u0000on; when an unin fected, unvaccina ted person ingests food or water that is contamina ted with the faeces of an infected person. The disease is closely associa ted with unsa fe water, inadequa te sanit a\u0000on, poor h ygiene. S ympt oma \u0000c pr ogression is r are with mos tly mild cases char acterized by full recovery and las\u0000ng immunity from further HAV infec\u0000ons. How ever, a few cases can be severe and life threatening. Safe and eec\u0000v e vaccines are available to prevent HAV infec\u0000on. Childr en are likely to have experienced an episode of hepa \u0000\u0000s A virus infec\u0000on before the age of 10. Those infected in childhood do not experience no\u0000ceable symptoms. Epidemics are uncommon due to herd immunity from prior infec\u0000on. HAV may lead to signic ant economic and social consequences due to dela yed recovery las\u0000ng weeks to mon ths; preven\u0000ng the expedit ed return to work, school or daily life. The impact on food establishmen ts, with iden \u0000ed HAV as a sour ce of transmission in outbr eaks, can be substan\u0000al. HAV rarely causes death. Unlik e HBV and HCV, HAV does not cause chronic liver disease and is rarely fatal; how ever, the infec\u0000on may cause substan\u0000al mort ality. Persons with pre-exis\u0000ng chronic liver disease, including chronic HBV and HCV, are at increased risk of serious complic a\u0000ons from infec\u0000on. vaccine-pr eventable disease transmi\u0000 ed through infected blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV is 50-100 \u0000mes more infec\u0000ous than HIV with several modes of transmission; such as perina tal transmission from infected mother to child, unsa fe sexual intercourse, transfusion of HBV-infected blood and blood products, unsa fe medic al procedur es, sharing of needles and sharp s and horiz ontally between childr en, as well as other intra-familial sour ces of infec\u0000on. Globally , it is es\u0000ma ted that 2 billion people have been infected with HBV of which appr oxima tely 240 million are chronic ally infected with HBV. Among those with chronic HBV, up to 30% go on to develop liver disease. The average prevalence rate for HBV in Nigeria Na\u0000onal Guidelines f or the Pr even\u0000on, Car e and T reatmen t of Vir al Hepa \u0000\u0000s in Nig eria,,, ranges between 11- 13.7% with an es\u0000ma ted 20 million Nigerians chronic ally infected. Ther e is no known virologic cure for HBV infec\u0000on, how ever an\u0000viral treatmen t has been shown to reduce the transmission risk, decr ease the likelihood of developing liver complic a\u0000ons resul\u0000ng in death and impr ove prognosis. Hepa \u0000\u0000s C infec\u0000on is a blood borne virus 10 \u0000mes more infec\u0000ous than HIV with no currently available vaccine. The mos t common modes of transmission are through HCV-infected blood, unsafe medical procedures, and sharing of needles and sharps. Less common modes of transmission are sexual and perina tal transmission. Globally , an es\u0000ma ted 80 million pa\u0000ents are , chronic ally in fected resul\u0000ng in r oughly 700 thousand dea ths per y ear. An es \u0000ma ted 3.6 million pa\u0000ents are infected with HCV in Nigeria; how ever, the epidemiology of HCV in Nigeria is not well dened due to paucity of data. With current HCV direct ac\u0000ng an\u0000viral (DAAs) agents, higher rates of sustained response have been recorded globally . Hepa \u0000\u0000s D infec\u0000on occur s exclusiv ely in persons infected with HBV; replic a\u0000on occur s solely in the presence of HBV. Co-in fec\u0000on with HDV and HBV can and mort ality. HBV vaccina ed mainly through contamina ted drinking water and food. Other transmission routes have been iden \u0000ed, which include transfusion of infected blood products and perina tal transmission. Hepa \u0000\u0000s E Virus (HEV) infec\u0000on is usually self-limi\u0000ng and resolv es within 4-6 weeks. Occasionally , fulminan t HEV develop s with acut e liver failur e, which can lead to death. Globally , HEV outbr eaks and spor adic cases occur in resour ce-limit ed countries with limit ed access to essen \u0000al water, sanit a\u0000on, hygiene and health services, and may aect large number s of people. In recen t years, outbr eaks have occurr ed in areas of conflict and humanit arian emer gencies, such as war zones, and in camp s for refugees or internally displaced persons (IDP). An es\u0000ma ted 20 million infec\u0000ons and 3.3 million acut e cases occur annually worldwide with an es\u0000ma ted 56,600 deaths. HEV infec\u0000on is associa ted with increased morbidity and mort ality in pregnan t women and new-borns. Ther e is no available treatmen t capable of altering the course of acut e HEV, although HEV vaccina \u0000on exists, it is not widely available. Preven\u0000on is the mos t eec\u0000v e appr oach against the disease. As HEV is self-limi\u0000ng , hospit aliza\u0000on is gener hospit aliza\u0000on is requir ed for people with fulminan t HEV and should also be consider ed for sympt oma \u0000c pregnan t women. Main taining standar ds for public water supplies, establishing proper waste manag emen t systems, and main taining hygienic prac\u0000ces such as hand washing with safe water, par\u0000cularly before handling food, can reduce the risk of infec\u0000on and transmission. Avoiding consump\u0000on of water and/ or ice of unknown purity , and adhering to safe food prac\u0000ces are also useful. 1.3GUIDING PRINCIPLE S The developmen t of this documen t is aligned with the Na\u0000onal Policy for the Control of Viral Hepa \u0000\u0000s in Nigeria. This is founded upon the following principles; 1.Universal Health Coverage: Ensuring that cura\u0000ve, viral hepa \u0000\u0000s. This can be achie ved through the following; Na\u0000onal Guidelines f or the Pr even\u0000on, Car e and T reatmen t of Vir al Hepa \u0000\u0000s in Nig eriaAccessibility: The provision of various viral hepa \u0000\u0000s services at dierent levels of the health care system. Aordability: The uptake of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s preven\u0000on, care and treatmen t, as well as support services should be at minimal cost. Availability: The provision of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s tes\u0000ng, vaccina \u0000on, al, labor atory as well as care and treatmen t services should be available at various poin ts of care throughout the health care system. Human rights and equity: The treatmen t of pa\u0000ents in a clien t-focused manner through which all pa\u0000ents receiv e the same level of care irrespec\u0000v e of gender , ethnicity or social status. 2.Governmen t owner ship: Governmen t at the Feder al, State, and Local levels should commit to ensuring the goal of health for all ci\u0000zens through provision of appr opria 4.Public health appr oach: Adopt the principles of public health appr oach to provide a useful frame work to guide a response to viral hepa \u0000\u0000s. The appr oach will include deni\u0000on of the problem through systema\u0000c collec\u0000on of informa\u0000on about the magnitude, scope, char acteris\u0000cs and consequences of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s.

Screening: Detec\u0000on of HCV an\u0000bodies is the rst step to diagnosis. Screening is conduct ed on whole blood, serum or plasma specimen, using rapid test or Enzyme Immunoassa y (EIA) kits that are appr oved by NAFD AC and other string ent regula tory authori\u0000es (FDA, WHO). Who to screen: Persons with past history of blood or blood products transfusion or organ transplan t People who inject drugs (PWID) Persons with a history of haemodialy sis Infants born to HCV posi\u0000v e mother s Contacts of HCV infected persons Health care workers especially those with known history of needle s\u0000cks/sharp s exposur e Clinic al evidence of chronic liver disease or abnormal liver enzyme tests Persons living with HIV (PLHIV) Pa\u0000ents with ta\u0000oos, scaric a\u0000on mark s, or other local surgical procedur es Men who have sex with men (MSM), Female sex workers (FSW), and persons with a history HCV will spon taneously clear the infec\u0000on and do not develop chronic infec\u0000on. These persons are HCV Ab seroposi\u0000v e but no long er infected with HCV. A nucleic acid test (NAT) for HCV RNA , which detects the presence of virus, is needed to dis\u0000nguish persons with chronic HCV infec\u0000on from those who have clear ed the infec\u0000on. NAT for HCV RNA is import ant prior to commencing and during treatmen t to assess treatmen t response. NAT can include RNA quan \u0000ta\u0000ve or qualit a\u0000ve tes\u0000ng for the detec\u0000on of HCV RNA and should be performed directly following a posi\u0000v e HCV serologic al test to establish the diagnosis of chronic HCV infec\u0000on. 3.HCV RNA 1-6) HCV RNA posi\u0000v e per son, the HCV genotyping should be done t o de termine op\u0000mal eatmen t only ar un-a vailable. of Liver disease 3.3.1: Clinic al Evalua \u0000on A detailed history and physical examina \u0000on of pa\u0000ents is requir ed.

With the arriv al of new an\u0000viral therapies, a high rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) is possible in almos t all pa\u0000ents. 3.4.1: Goal of An\u0000viral Ther apy The goal of an\u0000viral therapy in pa\u0000ents with chronic HCV is eradica\u0000on of HCV RNA , which is predict ed by a\u0000ainmen t of SVR. SVR is dened as comple \u0000on of an\u0000viral therapy. An SVR confers a 97 to 100 % chance of being HCV RNA nega\u0000ve during long-t erm follow -up and can therefore be consider ed as virologic cure of HCV infec\u0000on.

Adher ence to an\u0000viral treatment is an essen\u0000al component of individual and programma\u0000c treatment success. Adher ence is crucial for dela ying or preven\u0000ng the developmen t of drug resistance to some of the an\u0000viral drugs. The measur es to ensur therapy. 5.2 ADHERENCE PREP ARA TION FOR ANTIVIRAL THERAP Y The success of any adher ence strategy depends on the educ a\u0000on of the ini\u0000a \u0000on of treatmen t, an assessmen t of their under standing of and readiness for treatmen t. Adher ence counselling includes giving basic informa\u0000on B infec\u0000ons and their manif eects a\u0000ons. It also includes how the medic a\u0000ons should be taken and the import ance of not missing any dose, wha t to do if doses are missed and steps to be taken to restart therapy if doses are missed. Informa \u0000on and educ a\u0000on materials can be par\u0000cularly useful in this process. Consider a\u0000on should be given to the pa\u0000ent's lifestyle when possible, and may involve rela\u0000ves, friends and/ or community member s as agreed with the pa\u0000ent. 5.3 ONGOING ADHERENCE FOR CLIENT S ON ANTIVIRAL THERAP Y It is essen \u0000al to con\u0000nue every visit andr post treatmen t follow up. 5.4. MEASUREMENT OF ADHERENCE Virologic cure for HCV and func\u0000onal cure for HBV are strongly dependen t to taking the prescribed medic a\u0000ons. Adher ence in man y studies is measur ed by expressing the number of doses taken as a percentage of the number of doses prescribed. Measur emen t methods include: pa\u0000ent self-report, pharmacy drug pick-up, pill count, ques\u0000onnaire and electronic drug monit oring methods.

While the safety proles for medicinal products have been established, adverse events (AEs) are not uncommon. AEs are o\u0000en encountered with medicinal products in the course of preven\u0000on and pa\u0000ent manag emen t. AEs ovigilance. 6.1 PHARMA COVIGILANCE; ADVERSE DRUG REACTION AND ADVERSE EVENT S FOLLOWING IMMUNIZ ATION (AEFI) Pharmacovigilance is the science and ac\u0000vi\u0000es rela\u0000ng the detec\u0000on, assessment, under standing , response and preven\u0000on of adverse drug reac\u0000ons (ADRs) and other poten\u0000al medicine-related problems including adverse events following immuniza\u0000on (AEFIs). A pharmac ovigilance system is designed to monit or the safety of authorised medicinal products and detect any chang e to their risk-bene t ra\u0000o. A pharmac ovigilance system like any system is char acterised by its structur es, processes and outcomes (refer to Good Vigilance Prac\u0000ce). The pharmacovigilance system should be in such a way that public health emergencies and prepar edness plans are developed as appr opria te. (AE) is any untoward medic al occurr ence in or clinic al trial par\u0000cipan t adminis tered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal rela\u0000onship with the treatmen t. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavourable and unin tended sign (e.g. an abnormal labor atory nding), sympt om, or disease tempor ally associa ted with the use of a medicinal product, whe ther or not consider ed related to the medicinal product. Adverse drug reac\u0000on (ADR) is dened as a response to a drug which is noxious and unin tended, and which occur s at doses normally used in man for prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of a disease, or for the modic a\u0000on of physiologic al func\u0000on. follow s immuniz a\u0000on and which does not necessarily have a causal rela\u0000onship with the usag e of the vaccine. If not rapidly and eec\u0000v ely dealt with, can undermine condence in a vaccine and ul\u0000ma tely have drama \u0000c consequences for immuniz a\u0000on coverage and disease incidence. Repor\u0000ng of ADR and AEFI requir es structur es and processes for the collec\u0000on, recording and transmission of reports of suspect ed adverse reac\u0000ons associa ted with medicinal products for human use to the Na\u0000onal Pharmac ovigillance Center.

Drug toxicity can be detected clinic ally (history and clinic al examina \u0000on) and/ or through labor atory tes\u0000ng. In the event of drug toxicity , the oending drug(s) mus t be discon\u0000nued and chang ed to another drug from within its class. In adverse drug reac\u0000ons, the pa\u0000ent should be manag ed based on the classic a\u0000on of the ADR . 6.3.1 Labor atory Toxicity Labor atory interferon based regimens for hepa \u0000\u0000s treatmen t is very import ant for early detec\u0000on and preven\u0000on of some ADRs. The abnormal labor atory values (labor atory test abnormali\u0000es) may be early warning signals preceding the clinic al manif esta\u0000ons of some ADRs in pa\u0000ents receiving an\u0000-hepa \u0000\u0000s (medicines).

Essen \u0000al oper and service deliv ery issues will be addr essed on an ongoing basis to ensur e long-t erm eec\u0000v eness and sustainability of the na\u0000onal Program. This will be achie ved by making the best use of available , thereby human and nancial resour ces maximizing reten\u0000on of pa\u0000ents across the con\u0000nuum of care. Specic ally, eorts will be made to promot e task shi\u0000ing , improve laboratory and diagnos\u0000c services; and strengthen procurement and supply manag emen t systems. 7.1 DECENTRALIZ ATION AND OF SERVICE S Viral hepa \u0000\u0000s treatmen t and care services provider s should implemen t recommenda \u0000ons from this Na\u0000onal Guidelines services e to impr ovemen t in the accessibility and owner ship of services.

At all levels of to viral hepa \u0000\u0000s service provision, whe ther community -based there should be adequa te at health facility or human resour ce to cater for the needs of pa\u0000ents.

It involves health workers undert aking tasks that are not listed in their professional schedule of du\u0000es. Task shi\u0000ing reduces the burden of work on a par\u0000cular cadre of health worker and increases the eciency and produc\u0000vity in health facili\u0000es with large volumes of pa\u0000ent. Task shi\u0000ing applies to the dierent services that are oered to the community . 7.3 PROCUREMENT AND SUPPL Y GEMENT SYSTEMS Procur t and emen t systems are ed to ensur e that viral hepa \u0000\u0000s commodi\u0000es, including an\u0000viral medicines, vaccines and labor atory commodi\u0000es are available in sucien t quan \u0000\u0000es at all \u0000mes when they are needed. This depends on adequa te nancing , forecas\u0000ng, supply planning, procurement, warehousing, distribu\u0000on and tracking. The success ful adminis tra\u0000on of this t ocer s, distribu\u0000on agents, customs and excise ocer s, shipping agents, manuf actur ers of the commodi\u0000es and adminis trators of health facili\u0000es. The very rst step is in determining wha t should be procur ed and in wha t quan \u0000ty. Drugs and commodi\u0000es requir ed viral preven\u0000on treatmen t and care include: Vaccines An\u0000-viral drugs Rapid test kits and consumables Viral load reagents, sample collec\u0000on kits, commodi\u0000es, commodity distribu\u0000on process begins when reques ts are made, processed and the commodi\u0000es get to the end user through health care provider s at service deliv ery poin t. The logis\u0000c system for viral Logis\u0000cs Manag main taining appr opria te stock levels rests on the facility logis \u0000cs team. Facility's replenishmen t for consumed stock occur s bi-mon thly in response to submission of copies of the ordering Combined Report and Reques t forms. The reports are directly transmi\u0000 ed to the Central Medic al Stores and then to the Logis \u0000cs Unit in the Na\u0000onal Programme wher e they are analy sed for various decisions - ranging from rou\u0000ne re- supply to quan \u0000ca\u0000on and forecas\u0000ng and supply planning. Feedback on reports from the facili\u0000es is processed by the Logis \u0000cs Unit of NASCP and communic ated to the facili\u0000es. When orders are ready for pick-up, distribu\u0000on agents are no\u0000ed and the commodi\u0000es are transport ed Na\u0000onal Guidelines f or the Pr even\u0000on, Car e and T reatmen t of Vir al Hepa \u0000\u0000s in Nig eriaand Bimon thly R eview Period Report t to the cen tral Januar y - Februar y Report 1st - 7th Mar ch March - April R eport 1st - 7th Ma y May - June R eport 1st - 7th July July - Augus t Report 1st - 7th Sept ember Sept ember - October R eport 1st - 7th Nov ember November - December R eport 1st - 7th Januar y Table 7.1: Na\u0000onal R epor\u0000ng schedule Hepa \u0000\u0000s commodi\u0000es' logis \u0000cs system Inventory Control System The forced ordering (\"Pull\" system) has two-lev els (Cen tral and Facility) and is based on maximum-minimum thresholds. Service deliv ery poin ts are \"forced\" to order at the end of the review period (2 mon ths in FMOH program). The quan \u0000ty of commodi\u0000es in the logis \u0000cs system is tracked as a stock status (i.e. how long stocks will last). The maximum stock level (4 mon ths of stock in FMOH program) is set high enough to guar antee adequa te supply at all \u0000mes during the ordering cycle, but low enough to prevent overstock and wastage. The minimum stock level (2 mon ths of stock in FMOH program) is set as low as possible but includes a safety margin to prevent stock-outs. The stock level in the facility has to be assessed frequen tly as this will alert the storekeeper in case of the need to place emer gency order. The emer gency order is done when stock levels drop to 2 weeks of s tock; it disr egards the r eview period. The quan \u0000ty t o order is c alcula ted to top up the stock on hand to maximum level. 7.3.3 Logis \u0000cs Manag of \u0000mely and accur ate data for decision- making. These essen \u0000al data mus t always be collect ed for products at all levels. The three essen \u0000al data elemen ts include; Stock on Hand: Describes the quan \u0000\u0000es of usable stock of commodi\u0000es available at a par\u0000cular poin t in \u0000me. Stock-on-hand informa \u0000on guides us when to place an order and how much of each item is in stock. It also guides redistribu\u0000on decisions. Consump \u0000on: Describes the quan \u0000ty of commodi\u0000es used during the report and order cycle. The rate of consump\u0000on is the link between the consumer and the supply chain. Losses and Adjustmen ts: Losses include the quan\u0000ty of commo di\u0000es remov ed from the distribu\u0000on system for any reason other than usage (e.g. losses, expiry, and damage). Adjus tmen ts may include receipt or issue of supplies to or from one facility to another that is not Na\u0000onal Guidelines f or the Pr even\u0000on, Car e and T reatmen t of Vir al Hepa \u0000\u0000s in Nig eriatheir usual supplier (e.g. a transfer) or a correc\u0000on to account for a dierence between wha t was counted during a physical inventory and wha t was recorded on the inventory control card. Losses/ adjus tmen ts may therefore be a nega\u0000ve or posi\u0000v e number . In order to collect and report the abov e men \u0000oned data items, a number of forms described below were designed for the manag emen t of these commodi\u0000es. 7.3.4 The LMIS Forms /Tools Inventory Control Card This tracks the quan \u0000ty of health commodi\u0000es (vaccines, an\u0000-viral drugs, etc) in a facility's storage area. This record collects two essen \u0000al data items: stock on hand and the losses & adjus tmen t data. The Inventory Control Card should always be kept in a facility's storage area. Daily Consump \u0000on Record for Vaccines, An\u0000-Vir al drugs and Daily Usag e Record or Register for Test Kits and Reagents These collect the number of commodi\u0000es that have been used in the facility daily over a dened period of \u0000me. This informa \u0000on is called Consump\u0000on data and is one of the essen \u0000al data items. The Daily Consump\u0000on Record for An\u0000-Vir al drugs should be kept with the person(s) who dispenses. The Daily Usag e Record for test kits and reagents should be kept with the person(s) who runs the lab tests. Record for Returning /Transferring Commodi\u0000es This is a transac\u0000onal form that is used in the event that commodi\u0000es may be requir ed to be returned to the CMS or transferred to another facility at the same level for various reasons ranging from expiry, damag e, chang e in the treatmen t guidelines, or over-stocking. Combined Report Requisi\u0000on Issue and Receip t Form (CRRIRF) This form summariz es the informa \u0000on that is collect ed on the Inventory Control Card, Daily Consump\u0000on R ecord, and Daily Usag e Record and is sen t to the cen tral store on a r egular basis.

In considering how best to collect cri\u0000c al data, eorts should also be made to review monit oring systems, such as be\u0000er linkage of the monit oring of Hepa \u0000\u0000s with HIV, TB and other disease condi\u0000ons both at the community and facility levels. 7.4.3 Monit oring and Evalua \u0000on guidelines for Viral Hepa \u0000\u0000s Control Program in Nigeria for State and LGA Health Workers A guideline focusing on na\u0000onal core indic ators, tools and methodology for monit oring and evalua \u0000on of viral hepa \u0000\u0000s in Nigeria in has been developed. All states and LGAs in Nigeria are expect ed to collect and use the minimum core indic ators as enuncia ted in the Na\u0000onal Health Sect or M & E guidelines.

Monitoring: This is a process of tracking the progress and iden\u0000fy challenges of the implemen ta\u0000on of planned ac\u0000vi\u0000es and their outputs (using process/ output indic ators). This will ensur e that ac\u0000vi\u0000es are carried out in a \u0000mely manner , implemen ted according to planned objec\u0000v es, ensur e judicious use of resour ces and entrench accountability . Evalua \u0000on: This is a process of measuring Outcomes and Impacts of interven\u0000ons. Evalua \u0000on of outcomes and impacts is needed to documen t periodic ally whe ther dened strategies and implemen ted ac\u0000vi\u0000es leads to expect ed results in terms of: Outcomes : e.g. cure rate for HCV, rate of coverage of vaccines etc. Impacts : e.g. reduc\u0000on of morbidity , mort ality or economic losses. 7.4.4 Monit oring the outputs and out comes of sc aling up access t o an \u0000viral drugs In addi\u0000on to monit oring the implemen ta\u0000on of the strategies, Health Informa \u0000on Systems will also monit or the outputs and outcomes associa ted with the interven\u0000ons.
