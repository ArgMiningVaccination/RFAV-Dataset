Summary Cough is highly prevalent as a cumbersome presenting complaint for many pa tients. The symptom cough is elicited by a myriad of very different respiratory and non respiratory diseases. Symptomatic pharmacological treatment is of very limited effi cacy. Presently, no new drug for cough in the pipeline has completed phase II development. Ther efore, treating cough requires exact diagnosis for causal treatment. Cough is of ten the first (but not necessarily an early) symptom of life-threatening diseases, suc h as lung tumours or recurrent pulmonary embolism. Thus, in 2004, the German Respiratory So ciety published evidence-based guidelines on the management of cough. Acute an dc h r o n i c cough were defined, and algorithms were provided for diagnostic workup. I n2 0 1 0 ,t h e guidelines were updated (http: //leitlinien.net). An abridged english version is also now available [1]. In this review, evidence-based recommendations (mostly w eak evidence or consensus) from these guidelines are adapted into learning points. Cough is both an important physiological reflex protecting the airways, and a frequent complaint associated with virtually all pulmon- ary and several extrapulmonary diseases. Cough is also a contributing factor in the spreading of infectious disease, such as tuberculosis. Moreover, (acute) cough due to the common cold is one of the most frequent causes of primary care consultations. The reflex is characterised by complexity a n dp l a s t i c i t y ,a n di st r i g g e r e db yp h y s i c a la n d chemical stimuli. Irritant receptors and C-fibre receptors are activated in the airways, pleura, pericardium and oesophagus. The impulse is then transmitted to the brainstem coughgenerator circuit viathe vagus nerves. There is also a connection to the cortex, allowing voluntary control of both eliciting and, to a limited degree, inhibiting cough [2]. Efferent innervations reach the effector muscles (dia- phragm, abdominal, intercostals, back, and muscles of the larynx and upper airway). Mucociliary clearance is the primary means of clearing the bronchial system. To a certain degree, cough can compensate for impaired mucociliary clearance ( e.g.that caused by the effects of smoking). If mucociliary clearance is overwhelmed by aspiration, an intact cough reflex protects the lungs effectively. However, an impaired cough reflex, e.g. after stroke,HERMES syllabus link: module C1.5P.

The clearing competence of the cough reflex depends on several conditions: obstruction of the airways, bronchial collapsibility, lung volumes, respiratory muscle and laryngeal function, and the amount and viscosity of the mucus [3]. Cough is productive (wet) if the amount of the daily expectoration is o30 mL (two table- spoons' worth). The phlegm can be mucous, serous, purulent or bloody. Bronchial casts can also be produced. The cough reflex arc consists of five parts: 1) cough receptors; 2) afferent nerves; 3) brain- generator efferent nerves; and 5) organs (muscles). the cough nociceptors elicits pathological cough. Numerous respiratoryand other diseases cause cough nerve hypersen- sitivity and thus, produce cough. In a consider- able number of clinical cases, however, only cough nerve sensitivity is affected without another ''specific'' cause. Such patients are suffering from idiopathic cough. Classification and frequent causes of cough The myriad of different respiratory and other diseases eliciting cough requires classification both for diagnostic workup and treatment (tables 1 and 2).

Of course, these limits are arbitrary. Acute cough (due to common cold) usually lasts only 2-3 weeks. Various acute infections, ( e.g. Myco- plasma pneumoniae and adenoviruses), however, can elicit cough lasting f8 weeks; for example, Bordetella pertussis can cause cough lasting f3 months. In otherwise healthy individuals, acute infections of the upper and /or lower airways, the most common cause of cough, are self-limiting. Medical history and physical exam- ination are usually sufficient in the diagnosis, and over-the-counter (OTC; i.e.nonprescription) remedies for the treatment. However, a few special circumstances require immediate, full diagnosis of acute cough (table 3). In contrast, immediate diagnostic work-up is essential in all patients presenting with chronic (.8 weeks duration) cough; a chest radiograph a n dl u n gf u n c t i o nt e s ts h o u l db ep e r f o r m e d immediately. This is consistent with the recom- mendations in all published guidelines on cough [4-7]. If the chest radiograph proves inconclusive, the lung function test is unremarkable and cough is the only presenting symptom, it will always be difficult to establish the diagnosis. Themost common causes in the literature [5, 6, 8 - 1 0 ]a r es h o w ni nt a b l e4 . What are common causes of acute cough? Enhancing the cough nerve sensitivity following diseases can cause acute cough. Acute, self limiting viral infections of the upper and lower airways Common cold is the most common cause of cough and usually subsides spontaneously, in otherwise healthy persons, after 2-3 weeks [1 1]. Upper airways allergic disease Hay fever, and intermittent or persistent allergic rhinitis, often in combination with sinusitis, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis and laryngitis, can also trigger acute cough. Itchy eyes and throat are usually characteristic of these diseases [12]. Intermittent asthma Intermittent asthma, either allergic or due to infection, can cause acute cough. Aspiration Aspiration of a foreign body, most commonly in 1-3-yr-old children, as well as in elderly, fragile patients, triggers acute cough with expectoration of the foreign body, or permanent bronchial obstruction with consecutive chronic cough.Table 3 Circumstances requiring an immediate investigation of acute cough Haemoptysis Severe chest pain Dyspnoea High fever TB Stay in countries with high prevalence of TB Contact with a person stricken with TB Homelessness Illicit drug users Immunosuppressed states Immune deficiency e.g.CVID HIV infection Immunosuppressive therapy History of malignant tumour History of heavy smoking TB: tuberculosis, CVID: common variable immuno- deficiency.Table 4 Most frequent causes of chronic cough without definite chest radiography or lung function 1 Cough due to upper airway disease 2 Cough-variant asthma 3 Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (4) (Taking ACE antagonist medication) ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme. Learning points 1NDistinguish between acute ( f8 weeks duration) and chronic cough (.8 weeks); history and physical exam are usually adequate for diagnostic workup of patients with acute cough.NChronic cough patients need immediate further diagnostic measures (usua lly chest radiography and spirometry ). If they prove inconclusive, check for upper airway disease, variant asthma or gastro-oesophageal reflux disease.Management of cough in adults Breathe |December 2010 |Volume 7 |No 2 125Acute inhalative intoxication Workplace accidents, fires, and solvent or glue sniffing can lead to a toxic lung oedema, acute interstitial pneumonia and bronchiolitis with re- emergence of cough, often after a discomfort- and cough-free interval of 6-48 h. Immediate high-dose inhaled corticosteroid treatment should be initiated ( f100 puffs in 24 h). Post-infectious cough Post-infectious cough persists .3 weeks after an acute, often viral airway infection and resolves after,8 weeks. Epithelial damage after B. per- tussis orM. pneumoniae infection, or a transient increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), later subsiding spontaneously, are responsible for post-infectious cough. In the latter case, a short course of asthma treatment (inhaled corticoster- oids orb2-adrenergics [4]) is effective. Persistent BHR with consequent chronic cough without airflow obstruction is described as cough- variant asthma (see later). In this case, long-term inhaled corticosteroid treatment is required. Pneumonia Pneumonia should be considered as a cause of acute cough. Pleurisy Pleurisy is also a possible cause of acute cough. Pulmonary embolism 50% of patients with acute pulmonary embo- lism present with a cough [13]. Pneumothorax All forms of pneumothorax can be accompanied by a dry cough. Acute heart failure with pulmonary congestion Acute left heart failure (including lung oedema) can trigger both cough and bronchial obstruction[14, 15]. Bradycardia associated with acute emerging atrioventricular (AV) block II-III can greatly reduce stroke volume, eliciting pulmonary congestion and cough. Atrial premature beats can elicit acute cough [16]. What are the causesof chronic cough? Enhancing cough nerve sensitivity following diseases can cause chronic cough. Chronic bronchitis The World Health Organization defines chronic (nonobstructive) bronchitis as the presence of cough and phlegm on most days over a period ofo3 months during two consecutive years without other causes. Many patients suffering from chronic cough meet these criteria. From a therapeutic point of view, this diagnosis is only useful if an obvious cause ( i.e.smoking or work- related exposures) can be identified, cessation is possible and other causes of chronic cough have thoroughly been excluded. Though long-standing smokers frequently suffer from, but rarely com- plain of, cough and phlegm, chronic bronchitis is s e l d o mar e a s o nt oa t t e n dac o u g hc l i n i c . Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease By definition, patients with the chronic obstruc- tive bronchitis phenotype of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are suffering from cough and phlegm. Chronic cough is a common symptom of COPD. In contrast to simple chronic bronchitis (see earlier), not fully reversible airflow limitation, as measured by spirometry, is the condition sine qua non for the diagnosis of COPD. Asthma and other eosinophilic respiratory disease Asthma is often responsible for chronic cough [17]. Dry cough can elicit or worsen an asthma attack. Cough-variant asthma is characterised by dry cough and BHR. Wheezing, dyspnoea and bronchial obstruction are absent. Chronic cough with proven BHR can only be confirmed as variant asthma if asthma treatment (inhaled corticosteroids or b2-adrenergics) eliminates the cough [10, 18-24]. theHERMES syllabus link: module C1.5Learning points 2NIn otherwise healthy persons, common cold-related cough is self-limitin g, usually lasting 2-3 weeks. OTC medication is appropriate. Antibiotics do not influence the natural history of this disease.NIn the case of acute inhalative intoxication, immediately prescribe high -dose inhaled corticosteroid ( f100 puffs in 24 h).NBreathlessness, palpitation and acute cough are indicative of left heart failure, AV block and /or pulmonary embolism.Management of cough in adults 126 Breathe |December 2010 |Volume 7 |No 2absence of BHR. It to inhaled corticosteroid treatment [25, 26]. Lung tumours Cough is the most common presenting symptom of lung tumours [27]. If a patient presenting with chronic cough ( i.e.lasting.8 weeks) is not taking an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, chest radiography should be performed immediately. Furthermore, in order to exclude a lung tumour, each patient with unexplained chronic cough should have a bronchoscopy at the end of the diagnostic algorithm (fig. 2). Cough due to upper airway disease Chronic rhinitis and sinusitis (rhino-sinusitis) [28] are often associated with and /or anterior mucopurulent drainage, nasal stuffiness, facial pain, pressure, and /or fullness and decreased sense of smell. Chronic rhino-sinusitis can occur with or without nasal polyposis and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis, respectively. Chronic pharyngitis and laryngitis [29] and chronic affections of the external auditory canal [30] can also cause chronic cough. Vocal cord dysfunction Recurrent voluntary inspiratory (sometimes also expiratory) adduction of the vocal cords can elicit throat clearing, dry cough, wheezing and dyspnoea. Vocal cord dysfunction can mimic asthma and often affects younger women [31]. Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease Cough is triggered either by reflex, through reflux to the pharynx and larynx (laryngo- pharyngeal reflux), or microaspirations [32] of aerosolised gastric juice. Cough due to reflux can occur with or without heartburn [9] and does not necessarily coincide with reflux oesophagitis (nonerosive reflux disease). Thus, the gold standard of the reflux diagnosis is a triple-sensor, 24-h pH probe and impedance pH probe. The latter allows diagnosis of both acid and weakly acid reflux. Thus, aerosolised gastric juice, which probably plays a crucial role, can be measured directly by pharyngeal pH probe. Since pH probes are of limited sensitivity, frequently not available and poorly tolerated, high dose (2640 mg) proton pump inhibitor treatment over the course of f3 months can be carriedout as an alternative, thereby confirming or excluding the diagnosis of reflux cough [33] (fig. 2). However, unequivocal evidence for the efficacy of acid suppression from randomised controlled trials is lacking. In certain cases, surgical treatment (fundoplicatio) can be per- formed [34, 35], but no evidence-based selection criteria for surgery are yet available. Drug-induced cough Approximately 10% of women and 5% of men cough while taking ACE inhibitor medication [36], which increases cough reflex sensitivity. The therapeutic (antihypertensive, cardiac or nephroprotective) effects of an ACE inhibitor treatment can be replaced by angiotensin II receptor antagonists, which do not cause cough more frequently than placebo. For other drugs inducing cough, information is available at www.pneumotox.com Infections In adults, pertussis is a rare cause of chronic cough, but has been described even without a preceding phase of acute infection. In particular, patients with recent contact with persons suffer- ing from acute whooping cough should be checked for antibodies. However, interpretation of the results is difficult. After the acute exuda- tive phase of infection (taking f10 days) a direct culture of Bordetella is no longer possible and antibiotics will have no effect on cough or on the natural history of the infection. Chronic cough is a typical symptom of tuberculosis, and was one of its key diagnostic criteria in the pre-radiography era. Chronic cough due to heart disease Aside from chronic left heart failure (cough generally occurs upon physical exertion or prone position), AV block II-III, endocarditis [37] arrhythmia [38, 39] can cause pulmon- ary congestion-related chronic cough. Moreover, chronic cough as a side-effect of cardiac drugs, including ACE inhibitors, b-blockers (in patients with BHR) and amiodarone (eliciting alveolitis) has to be considered. Diffuse parenchymatous lung disease and systemic diseases with diffuse lung involvement In addition to dyspnoea, dry cough is the most common symptom of diffuse parenchymatousHERMES syllabus link: module C1.5Management of cough in adults Breathe |December 2010 |Volume 7 |No 2 127lung disease (DPLD). Some forms of diffuse parenchymatous lung disease cause cough at such an early stage that the DPLD can be missed by conventional chest radiography. Thus, an apparently ''normal'' chest radiograph and spirometry do not rule out early lung disease with cough. A high-resolution computed tomo- graphy (HRCT) scan can establish the diagnosis. Most systemic autoimmune disease can develop lung involvement and cause cough (e.g.Sjo\u00a8gren's syndrome, systemic lupus erythe- matosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis and vasculitides). Chronic cough in DPLD, however, can also be due to the treatment or infection. Cough due to inhalative events Chronic cough is caused if an aspirated foreign body becomes trapped in the bronchial system (usually in children 1-3 yrs of age), or due to chronic recurrent aspiration of food (liquids) resulting from dysphagia in underlying neurolo- gical conditions ( e.g.bulbar paralysis, Parkinson gravis). Other causes include tracheal-oesophageal fistula, mal- formations, neck dissection (head and neck cancer) and regurgitation in heavy gastro- oesophageal reflux disease Reactive airways dysfunction syndrome (RADS) occurs following short-term, intense inhalation of vapours, smoke or gases [41] (usually due to accidents in the workplace) and often develops into difficult asthma.Non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and tracheobronchomalacia Bronchiectasis can be missed on chest radiography. The gold standard for diagnosis is HRCT. Bronchi- ectasis usually causes productive cough with voluminous secretion, and often haemoptysis. Tracheobronchomalacia elicits chronic cough due to contact between the anterior and post- erior wall of disease. Abortive forms can manifest in adult- hood for the first time through cough, bronchial infections and bronchiectasis. Isolated orphan airways disease Isolated orphan airways disease usually emerges in patients .40 yrs of age. It can lead to expiratory bronchial collapse and irreversible central obstruction of the airways. Coughing is frequently the main symptom (table 6). Sleep apnoea Sleep apnoea patients often complain of chronic cough [44]. Psychogenic (habit) cough By definition, the sensitivity of the cough reflex is not increased in patients with psychogenic HERMES syllabus link: module C1.5Table 5 Chronic or deteriorating cough in patients with diffuse parenchym atous lung disease or autoimmune disease 1 Due to the lung involvement itself (e.g.Sjo\u00a8gren's syndrome, Wegener's disease, systemic sclerosis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia sa n ds a r c o i d ) 2 Due to the treatment (drug induced cough: methotrexate, cyclophosphamide) 3 Due to infections in the immunocompromised host Table 6 Rare isolated disease of the tracheobronchial tree Disease Comments Tracheobronchomegaly (Mounier-Kuhn syndrome) Commonly in male patients Tracheobronchial amyloidal infiltration Local infiltration of the central airways (possibly the larynx) by AL amyloid Relapsing polychondritis Autoimmune inflammatory disease Tracheobronchopathia osteochondroplastica Heterotopic ossification Juvenile recurrent respiratory papillomatosis Adolescents, young adults, casued by human papilloma virus AL: amyloid light chain.Management of cough in adults 128 Breathe |December 2010 |Volume 7 |No 2cough, but this is difficult to measure reliably. T h e r ei sa l w a y sar i s ko fm i s d i a g n o s i so f multicausal or idiopathic cough as psychogenic cough. Chronic idiopathic cough Despite extensive diagnostic procedures, under- lying causes ( e.g. reflux, asthma, etc.)o ft h e increased sensitivity of the cough reflex (as measured by standardised capsaicin or citric acid testing) cannot be determined in f18% of patients with chronic persistent cough (females: males52:1) [45]. Diagnosis of cough Applying diagnostic algorithms frequently allows for a provisional diagnosis, which must be con- firmed by successful treatment. Failure can, there- fore, require continued investigation based on the algorithm. Multicausal cough requiring com- bination treatment also has to be considered. Figures 1 and 2 show algorithms for the dia- gnosis of acute and chronic cough, respectively. Symptomatictreatment of cough Causal treatment should always be sought. However, if this approach is impossible ( e.g. acute viral respiratory infection) or would only prove effective in a delayed manner ( e.g. tuberculosis), symptomatic treatment can be considered instead of, or complementary to, causal treatment of cough. Symptomatic treatment targets one or several of the five parts of the cough reflex arc.

Every patient with unexplained chronic cough must have a bronchoscopy performed by the end of the diagnostic algorithm. If a patient complains of cough lasting .8 weeks, diagnostic workup should be initiated immediately. The first ste ps consist of collecting the patients' medical history and a physical exam (box 1). If a ( primarily) cardiac or neurological cause ( e.g.Parkinson syndrome or stroke) of cough is suspected, appropriate diagnostic workup must be initiated (box 3). Establishing the cause of chronic cough is challenging if neither the c hest radiograph, nor the lung function test prove conclusive. If bronchial hyp erresponsiveness (BHR) can be established by nonspecific inhalative pro vocation test (box 11), the cough can be treated as probable variant asthma. In smokers wi th inconclusive chest radiography and normal lung function, smoking-rel ated chronic, nonobstructive bronchitis is the most likely cause of cough.

Physiotherapy of cough Despite being clinical routine in both hospital and outpatient care [47], as well as in rehabi- litation, evidence for the efficacy of physiother- apy for cough is lacking. Physiotherapy aims to: 1) increase expectoration using effective cough- ing techniques for patients with productive but ineffective cough; 2) suppress voluntarily non- productive cough; and 3) instruct patient in the use of physiotherapeutic equipment improving expectoration, such as Acapella 1(DHD Health- c a r e ,W a m p s v i l l e ,N Y ,U S A ) ,F l u t t e r 1(Desitin / Scandipharm VarioRaw SA, Birmingham, AL, USA) and RC Cornet 1(BoniCur, Eastcote, UK). Pharmacotherapy Expectorants reduce irritation of the cough receptors by accumulated mucus through ''coughing up'', and represent the most common medication used for respiratory diseases in Germany ( e.g. ambroxol and N-acetylcysteine). Because of the lack of appropriate methods, effectiveness is difficult to assess. Regarding relative effectiveness of different expectorants, conflicting or inconsistent evidence exists throughout the published literature [48]. Sym- ptomatic use of expectorants is recommended to ease cough in cases with production of viscous secretions (COPD and bronchiectasis). Many patients also report positive subjective effective- ness using self-medication for acute bronchitis. Combination phytotherapeutics can reduce the duration of acute cough of the common cold [49, 50]. thought to reduce mucusproduction; however, their antitussive effect is n o tc o n s i s t e n t[ 5 1 ] . Theophylline and b2-adrenergics do increase mucociliary clearance, but are not effective relieving cough. By ''coating'' cough receptors in the throat, demulcents are thought to have an antitussive effect. Cough syrups, lozenges and drops, and honey share sugar as a common ingredient. Effectiveness, if any, is limited in time to the contact of the sugar with the receptor, which is usually 20-30 min. Systemica-adrenergics for nasal deconges- tion are popular in the US, but are virtually not in use in Germany and other parts of Europe. Fixed combinations with older, anticholinergic and central effective antihistamines ( i.e.clorphe- niramine or dexbrompheniramine) are not read- ily in Europe. Moreover, evidence forHERMES syllabus link: module C1.5should be continued. Provided their chest radiography proves negative, p atients with cough and heartburn can be provisionally diagnosed with ected gastro-oesophageal Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatme nt can commence. In the case of remarkable gastroenterological history, o ne should proceed according to current gastroenterological recommendations. If, after as long as 3 months high-dose PPI treatment does not resolve the sympt oms, continue the algorithm (including high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and bronchoscopy; box 20). If the cause of the cough remains unclear , extensive and targeted gastroenterological diagnosis should be perform ed. This includes endoscopy, oesophageal manometry and triple sensor pH- probe (or impedance for both acid and weakly acid reflux; box 23). At this point, the i ndication for surgery (fundoplicatio) can be assessed as well. Also, the m ost commonly missed diagnoses should be considered: early-stage, diffuse pa renchymatous lung disease not yet evident on chest radiography, eosinoph ilic bronchitis (eosinophil cell count in the sputum .3%; box 21) and a psychogenic cough (rare in adults) should all be taken into account. In some patients, the cause of chronic cough will remain unclear despite exhausting the avai lable diagnostic tools. In this case, the patient suffers from chronic idi opathic cough, where the source of an increased sensitivity of the cough reflex can not be established (box 26).

Antibiotics are only effective against cough caused by a bacterial infection, characterised by bronchitis. Inhalative and nasal corticosteroids, and oral leukotriene antagonists alleviate in asthma, eosinophilic bronchitis, post-infectious cough due to BHR, and rhinitis. Local anaesthetics disable electrophysiologi- cal activity in the receptors and afferent nerves (e.g.during bronchoscopy). They are increasinglyused off-label for idiopathic cough and in palliative medicine [52]. Drugs affecting central mechanism for cough (antitussives) include systemically applied morphine or codeine, as well as natural and synthetic derivatives ( i.e. dextromethorphan, dihydrocodeine, noscapine and sundew) claim central antitussive properties, though this is not proven by clinical studies. Opiates are recommended for effective symptomatic treatment of dry debilitating cough [53]. They have limited efficacy in the treatment of cough resulting from common cold [54]. References 1.
