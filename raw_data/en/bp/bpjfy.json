Find out! If you suffer from migraines, you might think you would already be well aware of the fact. After all, unlike many of the under- or misdiagnosed ailments cropping up in the news today, migraines are a well-known phenomenon. Interestingly, though, some estimates suggest that as many as half of all migraine sufferers mistakenly think of their condition as \"just a headache.\" Around 17% of Americans experience a migraine at some point during their lives, while about 13% report having had one or more migraines in the last three months. A migraine is defined as a severe, throbbing headache, often in conjunction with other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and/or sensitivity to light. In some cases, pain is felt only on one side of the head. Often, a migraine sufferer will experience a visual disturbance, referred to as an \"aura,\" before the onset of the headache. Auras serve as a warning sign that a migraine is on the way, and may present as blurred vision, seeing stars, or tunnel vision, among other possibilities. The vast majority of migraine sufferers \u2014 more than two thirds, in fact - are women, and the condition often runs in families. The root cause of a migraine is chemical changes in the brain that affect blood flow in and around the brain. Though researchers have been studying migraines for years, and a number of triggers have been identified, no one knows exactly why they happen. Common migraine triggers include: consumption of alcohol, stress, anxiety, perfumes or other fragrances, loud noises, bright lights, smoking, caffeine withdrawal, hormonal changes, loss of sleep, strenuous exercise, and missed meals. Many foods can also trigger migraines. These include, but are not limited to: foods containing monosodium glutamate (MSG), foods that are high in sodium (pickles, processed foods), foods that contain sulfites, nitrates, or tyramine (red wine, cheese, smoked fish, chicken livers, figs, some beans, bacon, hot dogs, salami, cured meats), onions, chocolate, nuts and nut butters, and dairy products. Over-the-counter medications have a limited impact on migraines, and many people who experience regular migraines opt for a prescription medication. There are a few home remedies that can help to lessen the frequency of migraines, or even soothe them after onset. Here's a look at some of the most common: - Drink plenty of water \u2014 Dehydration is a major cause of all types of headaches, including migraines. Be sure to stay hydrated, especially in the heat of summer. - Take [fish oil](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/can-fish-oil-cure-what-ails-you-10799) \u2014 Fish oil improves circulation, which could potentially reduce the frequency or severity of migraines. - Try a supplement \u2014 Doses of about 400 milligrams per day of magnesium and B2 (Riboflavin) have been shown to reduce the frequency of migraines, especially in women. - Take [butterbur](https://www.farmersalmanac.com/butterbur-mother-natures-allergy-cure-12156) \u2014 Butterbur (Petasites hybridus) is a member of the daisy family, native to Europe, North America, and Asia.
