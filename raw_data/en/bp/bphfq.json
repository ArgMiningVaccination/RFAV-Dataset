Meet Dr. Lindsay \u2014\u2014 Listen as Dr. Lindsay talks about our services and how they can help your child. Meet Dr. Lindsay - I'm Jesse Lindsay, and I'm an integrative pediatrician at the Polyclinic. At the Polyclinic, I'm going to start an integrative medicine consult practice. People 25 and under coming into get a more holistic approach to whatever problem or condition or concern that they are dealing with. Integrative medicine is really the bridge or the melding of traditional medicine, as well as complementary or alternative medicine using really evidence informed practices. When a patient comes to see me, my goal is to listen carefully to their current concerns, help address nutrition, lifestyle choices. I'm able to recommend herbs or supplements. And then if, say, something along the lines of acupuncture or massage therapy or hypnotherapy would be beneficial, I'm able to make that referral. I love the people that I work with at the Polyclinic. I really like my colleagues. I really like our staff and just hardworking spirit of our group. I am really excited and grateful for the opportunity to bring integrative medicine consultation to the Polyclinic. And I think that for kids, this is such an important service because no parent wants to put their child on medications. And if we can do things more naturally and talk about diet and sleep and mindfulness and relaxation techniques, I think that'll be a real benefit to our patients. When I'm not working, I enjoy being in nature with my two kids and husband, and exploring the natural world. FAQ - Our integrative medicine specialists take a holistic approach to health and healing.
