Forty-eight IDDM patients and 59 nondiabetic unrelated control subjects were recruited from the population in Taiwan. HLA-DQB1 exon 2 was enzymatically amplified by polymerase chain reaction. HLA-DQBl alleles were diagnosed by dot blotting and hybridization with 16 sequence-specific oligonucleotide probes. DQB1*0201 and DQB1*0302 alleles were more frequent and DQB1*0301 and DQB1*0601 were less frequent in Chinese with IDDM than in control subjects. Genotypes for homozygous non-aspartic acid residue (NA/NA) at position 57 were positively associated with IDDM at a relative risk of 4.34 (P < 0.001), and those for homozygous aspartic acid (A/A) were negatively associatedwith IDDM at a relative risk of 0.14 (P < 0.001). Among the NA/A heterozygotes, only DQB1*0201/ DQB1*0303 was significantly increased in IDDM subjects. The amino acid residue at position 57 of HLA-DQ 3-chain is significantly associated with the development or prevention of IDDM in Chinese subjects living in Taiwan. Other genetic and environmental factors may also play important roles in "}
