FSC LOGOUF HEALTH SHANDS | HOSPITALITY+SERVICE CELEBRATING OUR EVERYDAY HEROES A message from UF Health Shands CEO Ed Jimenez No matter what your role is at UF Health, your work supports our mission to move medicine forward ... to change patients' lives for the better and make our communities healthier. Not many people have this kind of opportunity to make a positive impact. Each May, we celebrate National Nurses Week and National Hospital Week by honoring everyone who provides and supports patient care and service in our hospital system. It's not easy work and it takes special people. Our leaders invite you to attend any of the events this month where we hand out food and say thank you in person. We'll also deliver treats to many of our off-campus outpatient locations. Please stop by if you can.These are token gestures, we know, and we can't reach everyone personally. That's why it's important for managers and staff to routinely step back to reflect on your team's progress and recognize everyone's contributions. I hope you'll do that this month, and regularly, to express appreciation with your fellow doctors, nurses, residents, employees, students and volunteers \u2014 because you are the foundation for everything we do at UF Health. On behalf of our executive team: thank you. We appreciate your dedication to our patients, to their loved ones \u2014 and to each other. I urge you to think about how you view the work you do, as part of the bigger Executive leaders celebrated with long-term service award recipients.

I hope you actively make the decision to like what you do, to take pride in it and to feel good about the great people you spend your time with here. Like I said, this is a challenging work environment. People depend on us and we hold ourselves to very high standards. There's a natural ebb and flow at work and the key is to keep our eyes on our progress at all times, to keep adapting, improving and moving forward. We've had an incredible past year, looking back, and many teams have moved into new spaces, expanded and taken on new challenges. We're always in a stage of shifting and settling down again. This ebb and flow mirrors our personal lives. I have a daughter who's been in college nearly a year. She left the house and doesn't need us like she did. We still have two other kids at home, and we are a busy family. But I had to learn to let go of how things were and make room for a \"new normal, \" just like I do at work when facing changes. I adapt and stay focused on what's working and how I can keep improving.If you can accept that there's complexity and change in all areas of life, keep your eyes on the horizon and accept the flow, you'll find great opportunities ahead. I was reminded of this at the Milestone Service Awards event, honoring many long-term employees. When I was handing out their pins and awards, I heard so many comments about how you have loved working here, and how you feel connected to colleagues and patients. This is a rewarding place to spend your time. Coming up, we also have the 2019 Employee Engagement Survey. Please participate! Y our feedback gives us a snapshot of how we're doing as an employer and tells us how we can keep improving. This is a great place to build a career and you're the reason we have an amazing work family. Thank you for choosing UF Health and making it so incredibly special. Thanks for all you do every day for those we serve. HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE CEO?

It is a time when we celebrate you ... our employees. The celebration begins at our Milestone Service Awards banquet and culminates with National Hospital Week. But it's the recognition of our Customer Service is the Key program honorees that really makes me proud. The CSK program allows anyone \u2014 patients, residents, visitors, faculty, staff and volunteers \u2014 to recognize individuals for outstanding work performance and attentive service. So what are the keys that create excellent customer service? Know your service. Whether it's patient care, accounting, marketing or environmental services \u2014 we need to understand how we fit in, what's our place at UF Health Shands and how our work is important to creating loyal customers for our health care system. Be friendly. A smile and a kind word go a long way, not just with patients and their families but also with each other. Use our hospitality standards. Everything that we learn in monthly hospitality huddles and during hospitality training and the tools that we are given provide a positive experience for our patients, their families and visitors and our faculty and staff. Show respect. Always be courteous and respectful to anyone you encounter. Listen. This is one of the simplest secrets for top customer service. It means you are truly hearing what others are saying. Be responsive. If you don't know the answer to a question or are unable to solve an issue, get help ... find someone who can figure things out so your customer feels heard and cared about. Use any feedback you receive. If a customer provides feedback, good or bad, take the time to review it and decide if you're meeting expectations or need to make adjustments to improve customer service. The key to good customer service is building good relationships with your customers. In the next few pages, you'll read about some of our team members who have gone above and beyond and made an impact on our patients, families, visitors and co-workers. Each person is holding a chalkboard that lists their individual keys to success, a creative list of words and phrases that inspire them daily in their roles at UF Health and throughout their personal life journeys. As you read each page, I challenge you to ask yourself what are the keys to your own success. What inspires you and motivates you? These employees understand the keys to success and are great representatives of our organization's values, mission and goals. Each year, we receive thousands of CSK nominations detailing stories of generosity, attention and action. They include acts as simple as a gesture that brightened someone's day, or as crucial as a quick response that prevented a medical error.

The Radiation Oncology team treated a patient with oral cancer. The patient had severe complications from surgery and needed care from a skilled nursing facility. This patient was the sole caregiver of elderly parents who lived more than two hours away. The patient was unable to communicate because of a tracheostomy and worried about getting updates to family members. At the patient's request, Susan made weekly phone calls to the patient's mother, during a three-month period, to update her on the patient's condition. Susan's kindness eased their minds and allowed them to get through the ordeal without further hardships. We recognize Susan for going above and beyond for our patients.

This equipment is like each building's central nervous system, housed in numerous telecommunication rooms, known as \"TR rooms. \" They are required for patient monitoring, operations, entertainment and any other high-tech functions of the hospital. The newer UF Health Heart & Vascular Hospital and UF Health Neuromedicine Hospital and the UF Health Shands Cancer Hospital already have updated TR rooms and capacity for expansion. Now it's time to upgrade the TR rooms in UF Health Shands Hospital. In the original hospital, several TR rooms also house storage for our nursing units. This shared space has created problems. \"Nursing has lost a lot of valuable space that they need, \" said Stephanie Smith, UF Health IT Services technical services director. \"In order for us to grow and support more services, we take more and more space from them in the rooms as we put more switches and cabling in. \" Motivated to resolve this issue, IT Services and Facilities staff are working together on a strategic, five-and-a-half-year plan to build a chase, or an enclosed metal framework, on the exterior of the UF Health Shands Hospital building to house the wiring. Site preparation began in April and construction should begin in late June. \"To me, what's kind of fun is the collaborative effort of IT and Facilities. We're working together to come up with a unique solution that creates space for nursing by building this new chase on the outside, which allows us to free up space that is currently being used by IT, \" said Brad Pollitt, A.I.A., UF Health Shands Facilities vice president.The benefits of this solution include an increase in the security and stability of the information transmitted by this technology. \"The project will connect every single TR on every floor to our two main routers. That way, if we lose one source, the system stays live, \" Smith said. \"This is what we have in the heart and neuro hospitals as well as at the cancer hospital. \" Du Meyer, UF Health Shands Facilities Design and Construction Services director, added, \"This will enable our operations and our nursing teams to buy the latest equipment. We had to postpone this because of the extra cost and not having the capacity. \" This initiative will support increased patient satisfaction, education, technical personalization and safety. 16 NEWS +NOTES || MAY 2019 NEWS +NOTES || MAY 2019 17UF HEALTH REHAB HOSPITAL | GROWTH+EXPANSION UF HEALTH AND SELECT MEDICAL OPEN DOORS OF NEW REHAB HOSPITAL New hospital has 10 additional licensed beds BY LEAH HARMS Our rehab hospital opened in its new location on March 5, with a new name: UF Health Rehab Hospital.

This year's National Nurses Week nationwide theme focuses on the 4 million nurses practicing in the U.S. For those of us at UF Health, it means a lot because we have more than 3,200 nurses to celebrate here in our hospital system and physician practices!

They may feel overwhelmed, lost and confused. This is a reality for many patients and families who come to our hospitals every year. To help these Limited English Proficiency, or LEP , patients, our Patient Experience team provides foreign-language interpretation services. The Patient Experience department is part of the UF Health Sebastian Ferrero Office of Clinical Quality and Patient Safety. The team has three full-time, nationally certified Spanish medical interpreters, one on-call interpreter, three LEP ambassador volunteers (who are UF students), American Sign Language interpreters and more than 100 authorized interpreters, who are bilingual UF Health faculty and staff who have taken language testing to assist foreign-language patients in the medical environment. Along with these interpreters, every LEP patient is provided with a CyraCom interpreter phone or access to 24/7 video interpretation services. The phones can be used when in-person medical interpreters are not available and/or for patients who speak languages not covered by our interpreters, faculty or staff. The phone system provides immediate access to interpretation in 200 languages. Two of the three Patient Experience LEP ambassador volunteers, Carlos Sobrino and Camila Rodriguez, work weekly shifts with LEP patients to provide caring and community. While the main goal of the LEP program is to ensure that all nursing and medical staff are aware when a patient is LEP and requires interpreter support, the ambassadors also pride themselves on making genuine connections and forming professional relationships with the patients. Sobrino, who has been an LEP ambassador volunteer for almost a year, said the program is important to him because of the personal connections. \"Growing up, my mom would bring me to her doctor appointments to act as her interpreter because she had difficulty understanding English and often felt misunderstood by her physicians, \" said Sobrino, who grew up speaking Spanish. \" As a child I quickly learned the implications that a language barrier can have on an individual, not only physically, but also emotionally. \" Rodriguez, who hopes to be a bilingual speech pathologist, said that during her weekly three-hour shift, she visits patients and, sometimes, even calls former patients to follow up with them. She said having the opportunity to follow patients through their health care journey is one of her favorite aspects of the LEP ambassador program. On these phone calls, she also gets feedback from the patients, which she says is almost always positive. \"My favorite part about this program is the immediate impact you see, \" Rodriguez said. \"There is nothing better than talking to the patient and seeing their face light up, and the gratitude they express when they find out about these services. \" The ambassador program began in January 2017 and has maintained at least one active volunteer. With three volunteers, the team hopes to reach even more patients. \"Having access to the program ensures LEP patients are aware of the free language access services available to them while they are staying in the hospital, \" said Anne Meiring, LCSW , CPXP , Patient Experience team patient experience and language-access improvement specialist. To become part of the ambassador program, you don't have to know a second language, but it is preferred. Ambassadors need to be enthusiastic about helping people through difficult times and maintain a positive attitude. Please contact Anne Meiring at meiria@shands.ufl.edu for more information.
