NSF is tasked with keeping the United States at the leading edge of discovery in areas from astronomy to geology to zoology. So, in addition to funding research in the traditional academic areas, the agency also supports \"high-risk, high pay-off\" ideas, novel collaborations and numerous projects that may seem like science fiction today, but which the public will take for granted tomorrow. Grant Program Highlights [Biological Sciences Program](https://www.nsf.gov/bio/about.jsp) The mission of the Directorate for Biological Sciences (BIO) is to enable discoveries for understanding life. BIO-supported research advances the frontiers of biological knowledge, increases our understanding of complex systems, and provides a theoretical basis for original research in many other scientific disciplines. [Computer and Information Science and Engineering Program](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/about.jsp) The Directorate for Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE) supports investigator-initiated research in all areas of computer and information science and engineering, fosters broad interdisciplinary collaboration, helps develop and maintain cutting-edge national computing and information infrastructure for research and education, and contributes to the development of a computer and information technology workforce with skills essential for success in the increasingly competitive global market. [Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Program](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/aci/about.jsp) The Advanced Cyberinfrastructure (ACI) Division supports and coordinates the development, acquisition, and provision of state-of-the-art cyberinfrastructure resources, tools, and services essential to the advancement and transformation of science and engineering. ACI also supports forward-looking research and education to expand the future capabilities of cyberinfrastructure.
