PROGRAM DESCRIPTION AND HISTORICAL CONTEXT In November 2010, the Federal government approved California's five -year Medicaid section 1115 Bridge to Reform waiver, t hrough which the state received the necessary authority and corresponding Federal support to invest in its health care delivery system and prepare for the full implementation of the Affordable Care Act. The Bridge to Reform wa ivr achieved the goals of simu ltaneously implementing an historic coverage expansion, beginning the process of transforming the health care delivery system, and reinforcing California's safety net to meet the needs of the uninsured. Medi -Cal 2020 embodies the shared commitment betwe en the state and the Federal government to support the successful realization of some of the most critical objectives for improving our health care delivery system. Bridge to Reform waiver initiatives such as the managed care delivery system for Seniors an d Persons with Disabilities (SPDs) and the state's Coordinated Care Initiative (CCI) will continue through in Medi -Cal 2020, and with the foundation of the successes of the Bridge to Reform Waiver, Medi -Cal 2020 initiatives will continue to improve the qua lity and value of care provided to California's Medi -Cal beneficiaries. Medi -Cal 2020 initiatives include: 1. A Public Hospital Redesign and Incentives in Medi -Cal program (PRIME), which will improve the quality and value of care provided by California's s afety net hospitals and hospital systems; 2. A Global Payment Program that streamlines funding sources for care for California's remaining uninsured population and creates a value -based mechanism to increase incentives to provide primary and preventive care services and other high -value services ; California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 4 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 3. A Whole Person Care Pilot program to support local and regional efforts to integrate the systems and improve the care provided to Medi -Cal's most high -risk beneficiaries; and 4. A Dental Transformation Initiative to i mprove access to dental care and reduce preventable dental conditions for Medi -Cal beneficiaries. III. GENERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS 1.

The state must obtain the input of recipients and other stakeholders in the development of its r evised Quality Strategy and make the Strategy available for public comment before adopting it as final, and submitting to CMS for approval. The state must revise the strategy whenever significant changes are made, including changes through this demonstrati on. The state will also provide CMS with annual reports on the implementation and effectiveness of the updated Quality Strategy as it impacts the demonstration. 29. External Quality Review. The state is required to meet all external quality review (EQR) requirements found in 42 C.F.R. Part 438, subpart E. The state should generally have available its final EQR technical report to CMS and the public by April of each year, for data collected within the prior 15 months. This submission timeframe will align with the collection and annual reporting on managed care data by the Secretary each September 30th, which is a requirement under the Affordable Care Act [Sec. 2701 (d)(2)]. V. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS 30. Certified Public Expenditures (CPEs). Total computable expenditures for patient care that are either directly payable under this Demonstration, or the basis for DSH, may be certified by government entities that directly operate health care providers as long as the expenditures are not funded using impermissibl e provider taxes or donations as defined under section 1903(w) of the Social Security Act or using Federal funds other than Medicaid funds (unless the other Federal funding source by law allows use of federal funds for matching purposes, and the federal Me dicaid funding is credited to the other federal funding source). To the extent that the funding source for expenditures is a state program funded through this Demonstration, expenditures may be certified only as a total computable expenditure under such p rogram. The State may not claim federal matching funds for a payment to a provider and also claim federal matching funds on the underlying expenditure certified by the provider, except to the extent that the State has an auditable methodology to prevent duplicate claims (such as one that limits claims for federal matching based on the certified expenditure to the shortfall after accounting for the claimed payment). For this purpose, Federal funds do not include, PRIME Payments, patient care revenue receiv ed as payment for other services rendered under programs such as DSHP, Medicare or Medicaid. To ensure that there is no double claiming of federal funding under the DSHP, a detailed protocol will be developed outlining the procedures to be followed for cla iming under this paragraph. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 15 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 31. Designated State Health Programs (DSHP). The state may claim FFP for the following state programs subject to the annual limits described below . Expenditures are claimed in accordance with CMS -approved claiming protocols in Attachment F. a. The annual limit the state may claim FFP for DSHP shall not exceed $ 75,000,000 FFP per DY11 -15 (or $375,000,000 total for the 5 years ), except as provided herein. In the event that the state does not claim FFP up to the $75,000,000 annual limit in a given DY under this demonstration period, the state may exceed the $75,000,000 annual limit for claiming FFP for DSHP expenditures in a subsequent DY by an amount equal to the difference of $75,000,000 and the amount of FFP claimed for DSHP in that applicable prior DY . The total amount of DSHP FFP that the state may claim in DY 11 through 15 combined may not exceed the non-federal share of amount s expended by the state for the Dental Transformation Incentive Program. b. Approved Designated State Health Programs (DSHP) for which FFP can be claimed subject to the limits in this paragraph are: State Only Medical Programs California Children Services (CCS) Genetically Handicapped Persons Program (GHPP) Medically Indigent Adult Long Term Care (MIALTC) Breast & Cervical Cancer Treatment Program (BCCTP) AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Department of Developmental Services (DDS) Prostate Cancer Treatment Program (PCTP) Workforce Development Programs Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development (OSHPD) Song Brown HealthCare Workforce Training Program Steven M. Thompson Physician Corp Loan Repayment Program Mental Health Loan Assumption Program c. Prohibited DSHP Expenditures . Allowable DSHP expenditures do not include any expenditures that are funded by federal grants (for example, grants from the Health Resources and Services Administration, or the Centers for Disease Contro l, or from the Global Payment Program ) or that are included as part of the maintenance of effort or non -federal share requir ements of any federal grant. Additionally, allowable DSHP expenditures do not include expenditures associated with the provision of non-emergency care to non -qualified aliens. To implement this limitation, 13.95 percent of total provider expenditures or claims through DSHP identified below will be treated as expended for non -emergency California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 16 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 care to non -qualified aliens. i. Expenditures for the Medically Indigent Adult Long Term Care (MIA/LTC) program will not be reduced by 13.95 percent because there are no non -qualified aliens receiving services under this program. ii. Expenditures for the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment P rogram (BCCTP) will be reduced by the costs related to providing services to those individuals with aid codes used to designate non -qualified aliens; however, the 13.95 percent reduction will not be applied otherwise. iii. Expenditures for the California Childr en Services (CCS) program will be reduced by 13.95 percent as specified in subparagraph (a). iv. Expenditures for the Genetically Handicapped Persons Program (GHPP) will be reduced by 13.95 percent as specified in subparagraph (a). v.

The state shall make supplemental payments to Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal 638 facilities to take into account their responsibility to provide uncompensated care and support the IHS and tribal 638 service delivery network. Supplemental payments shall be computed based on the uncompensate d cost for services that were eliminated from Medi -Cal coverage in July 2009 pursuant to state plan amendment 09-001, furnished by such facilities to individuals enrolled in the Medi -Cal program . Participating tribal facilities shall maintain policies for furnishing services to non - IHS beneficiaries that are in place as of January 1, 2013. Payments shall be based on the approved methodology set forth in Attachment F . The annual limit for the IHS uncompensated care cost shall be $ 1,550,000 total computable per year (DY 11 - 15). VI. STATE PLAN AND DEMONSTRATION POPULATIONS AFFECTED BY THE DEMONSTRATION 33. Eligibility . Certain state plan eligibles are affected by the Demonstration , as described below . State plan eligibles derive the ir eligibility through the Medicaid state p lan and are subject to all applicable Medicaid laws and regulations in accordance with the Medicaid state p lan, except as expressly waived in this demonstration and described in these STCs. Any Medicaid State Pla n Amendments to the eligibility standards and methodologies for these eligibility groups, including the conversion to a modified adjusted gross income standard January 1, 2014, will apply to this demonstration. These state plan eligible beneficiaries are California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 17 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 affected by the demonstration by being required to use t he managed care network and gaining access to additional benefits not described in the state plan. The following population groups are affected by the Demonstration : a. State Plan California Children's Services (CCS) Affected by the Demonstration are those children with Special Health Care Needs who are: i. Under 21 years of age; and ii. Meet the medical eligibility criteria as defined in the California Code of Regulations such as congenital anomalies, cerebral palsy, hearing loss, cancer and diabetes; and iii. Meet financial eligibility criteria for CCS if they are: 1. Enrolled in Medi -Cal (pe r the Medicaid State Plan); 2.

Foster Care Children are Medicaid beneficiaries who are receiving foster care or adoption assistance (Title IV -E), are in foster -care, or are otherwise in an out -of-home placement. f. Community Based Adult Services (CBAS) Populations are persons who are age 18 or older and meet CBAS eligibility under STC 95(a) and (d). g. New Adult Group. The new adult group, described in section 1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Social Security Act and 42 CFR 435.119, pursuant to the approved state plan will be required to obtain services through this demonstration's managed care delivery system as described in these STCs . Benefits for the new adult group are described in the state's approved al ternative benefit plan state plan amendment. h. Cal MediConnect eligible beneficiaries are defined in the California -CMS Financial Alignment Memorandum of Understanding signed March 27, 2013 and further clarified in the three -way contracts between the State, CMS, and the participating plans. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 18 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 i. Coordinated Care Initiative (CCI) Eligible Beneficiaries : are individuals age 21 and older and includes dual eligible beneficiaries who opt out or are excluded from the Cal MediConnect program, Medi -Cal only Seniors and Persons with Disabilities (SPDs) who were previously excluded from the mandatory managed care SPD transition program, and Medi -Cal managed care enrollees who reside in one of the followin g 7 counties:, Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Mateo, and Santa Clara, excluding: Beneficiaries enrolled in PACE ; Beneficiaries enrolled in the AIDS Healthcare Foundation ; Medi-Cal-only beneficiaries excluded due to an approved Medical Exemption Request , and; Beneficiaries enrolled in SCAN. j. Low-income Pregnant Women , defined as pregnant women with incomes up to and including 138 percent of the FPL will be required to obtain services through this demonstration's managed care delivery system. Beneficiaries who are pregnant women in fee -for-service prior to August 1, 2015 may remain in fee -for-service for the duration of their pregnancy and post -partum period to ensure continuity of care. Any pregnant women voluntarily moving from FFS to managed care will be provided appropriate care coordination. All Medi caid populations served by public hospital systems that participate in the PRIME program may be affected by payment incentives for such systems that are designed to further efforts to restructure care delivery to improve quality and appropriateness of care settings. VII. DEMONSTRATION DELIVERY SYSTEMS If the State chooses to use a managed care delivery system to provide benefits to the affected populations ( defined in STC 33), any managed care delivery system which uses managed care organizations (MCOs), health -insuring organizations (HIOs), prepaid inpatient health plans (PIHPs), or prepaid ambulatory health pla ns (PAHPs) [collectively referred to as managed care entities] is subject to all applicable Medicaid laws and regulations, including but not limited to sections 1903(m), 1905(t), and 1932 of the Act and 42 CFR Part 438. Health Insuring Organizations a re managed care delivery systems unique to California and operate under the authority of section 9517(c) of COBRA 1985, which was subsequently amended by section 4734 of OBRA 1990 and MIPAA 2008. HIOs are exempt from the managed care requirements of secti on 1932 of the Act (implemented through 42 CFR Part 438) because they are not subject to the requirements under 1903(m)(2)(A) that apply to MCOs and contracts with MCOs. 42 CFR 438.2 identifies these as county -operated entities and California state law that passed simultaneously with OBRA 1990 identifies these as county -organized health systems (COHS). The entities covered by the 1915(b) waivers in subparagraph b. and c. operate under the HIO authority to deliver benefits to State plan populations; the HP SM is considered a COHS, but is not considered an HIO by Federal standards because it became operational after January 1, 1986. A COHS plan must enroll all Medicaid beneficiaries residing in the county in which it operates. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 19 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 In Humboldt County, beneficiari es may be subsequently disenrolled from COHS to be enrolled in the Program of All Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), if eligible. Medicaid beneficiaries residing in COHS counties may not be enrolled in any other alternative delivery system without prior approval from CMS and an amendment to this demonstration. The counties participating in the Two Plan Model offer a choice of two types of MCOs - a local initiative plan (a county -organized plan which includes local Safety Net providers and clinics) and a commercial plan. The counties participating in the Geographic Managed C are (GMC ), Imperial, and Regional Model s of managed care offer a choice of two or more MCOs. San Benito County offers a choice of one MCO or the States Fee -For-Service delivery system , enrollment in managed care is voluntary . 34. Managed Care Expansions . The State has been granted the authority to operate managed care programs in the counties in Attachment M. Therefore, a Demonstration amendment is not required to implement expansions in these counties. However, any new service area expansions, proposed changes in Demonstration authorities, or changes in the populations included or excluded in the authorized counties will require an amendment to the Demonstration as outlined in STC 8 , including updated Attachment L . All managed care expansions , with benef iciary protections and contract requirements described under the 2010 -2015 \"Bridge to Reform \" Demonstration must maintain the required beneficiary protections and contract requirements with the renewal. 35. Encounter Data Validation Study for New Health Plans. When a managed care entity begins serving the populations in STC 33in the Demonstration, the State will be responsible for conducting a validation study 18 months after the effective date of the contra ct to determine completeness and accuracy of encounter data. The initial study will include validation through a sample of medical records of Demonstration enrollees. 36. Submission of Encounter Data. The State will submit encounter data to the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS) as is consistent with Federal law, pol icy and regulation. The State must assure that encounter data maintained at managed care entities can be linked with eligibility files maintained at the State. 37. Standard Transact ion Formats for Transmission of Payment and Enrollment to Managed Care Entities. The State must ensure that regular capitation payments and plan enrollment rosters provided to the managed care entities serving Demonstration populations are generated throug h an automated process that is compliant with the appropriate standard HIPAA ANSI X12 transaction file format. 38. Contracts. No FFP is available for activities covered under contracts and/or modifications to existing contracts that are subject to 42 CFR 4 38 requirements prior to CMS approval of such contracts and/or contract amendments. The State will provide CMS with a minimum of 60 days to review and approve changes. CMS reserves the right, as an alternative to witholding all FFP for a contract when CM S determines that the state and the contractor are making good faith eff orts to come into compliance, to withhold FFP in part until the contract compliance and approval requirement is met for that contract. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 20 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 39. Capitation Payments . The State must ensure th at regular capitation payments made to the Medicaid health plans that are covered under this Demonstration are done through an automated process that is compliant with the standard HIPAA ANSI X12 820 electronic transaction format. . Likewise, the State mus t ensure that regular plan enrollment rosters are provided to the Medicaid health plans covered under this Demonstration through an automated process that is compliant with the standard HIPAA ANSI X12 834 electronic transaction format. 40. Network Adequacy . The State must ensure that each managed care entity has a provider network that is sufficient to provide access to all covered services in the contract . To the extent that the state applies an exception alternate access standard to its Knox -Keene Medi -Cal managed care health plan contract network standards the state shall provide the CMS with the following information no later than 30 days after approval: a. The geographic zip codes where the exception is applied; b. The reason(s) for applying this excepti on; and c. A description of how the health plan network being certified for network adequacy compares to the number of FFS provider in the region where the exception is applied or the previous plan network, whichever is applicable. d. And annual ly thereafter: i. The geographic zip codes where the exception is applied; and ii. The reason(s) for applying this exception . If reports are not submitted on time CMS reserves the right as a corrective action to withhold FFP (either partial or full) for managed care capitation payments for the Demonstration until the requirement is met. 41. Network Requirements . The State must through its health plans deliver adequate primary care, including care that is delivered in a culturally competent manner that is sufficient to provide access to covered services to the low -income population, and coordinate health care services for Demonstration populations. a. Special Health Care Needs - Enrollees with special health care needs must have direct access to a specialist as appropriate for the individual's health care condition. b. Out of Network Requirements - The State through its health plans must provide Demonstration populations with the corresponding Demonstration program benefits described within these STCs and must adequately cover these benefits and services out of network in a timely fashion, for as long as it is necessary to provide them, at no additional cost to the enrollee. c. Timeliness - The Medi Cal managed care health plans must comply with timely access requirements and ensure the ir providers comply with these requirements . Providers must meet State standards for timely access to care and services, considering the urgency of the service needed. Network providers must offer office hours at least equal to those offered to the health plan's commercial line of California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 21 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 business enrollees or Medicaid fee -for-service participants, if the provider accepts only Medicaid patients. Contracted services must be made available 24 hours per day, seven days per week when medically necessary. The State, thr ough the health plan contracts must establish mechanisms to ensure and monitor provider compliance and must take corrective action when noncompliance occurs. d. Credentialing - The State through its health plans must demonstrate that the health plan provider s are credentialed. The State must also require these health plans to participate in efforts to promote culturally competent service delivery. e. Demonstrating Network Adequacy - Annually the State must provide adequate assurances that it has sufficient capa city to serve the expected enrollment in its service area. i. The State must provide supporting documentation that must show that the health plan offers an adequate range of preventive, primary, and specialty services care for the anticipated number of enrol lees in the service area. The network must contain providers who are sufficient in number, mix, and geographic distribution to meet the anticipated needs of enrollees. ii. The State through its health plans must submit this documentation when it enters into a contract. iii. The State must submit this documentation any time that a significant change occurs in the health plan's operations that would affect adequate capacity and services. iv. Significant changes include changes in services, benefits, geographic service area, or payments or the entity's enrollment of a new population. 42. Certification - Prior to enrollment and annually, the State is required to certify to CMS that each health plan has complied with State standards for service availability and must make all documentation available to CMS upon request. 43. Concurrent Operation of the Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) 1915 (c) Home and Community Based Services (HCBS) program ( CA 0141) . Payment for the MSSP 1915 (c) waiver services will be included in the plan capitation payments from the State starting July 1, 2014. Eligible beneficiaries in the seven CCI counties who are participating in the MSSP waiver will be allowed to join the Cal MediConnect program, if eligible, or mandatorily enrolled in a plan. The Cal MediConnect plans and Medi -Cal only managed care plans will be required to contract with MSSP providers to ensure on -going access to MSSP waiver services for MSSP enrolled benef iciaries at the time of transition through December 31, 2017. MSSP waiver providers will continue to provide the same services to MSSP Waiver participants/clients; however, they will receive payment for Medi - Cal managed care members from the plans. These requirements shall be outlined in the plan and MSSP Waiver provider contracts VIII. CONTINUING OPERATION OF DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS Community -Based Adult Services (CBAS) for Medi -Cal State Plan Populations 44. Community -Based Adult Services (CBAS) Eligibility and Delivery System.

If there is insufficient CBAS Center capacity due to Center closure(s) to satisfy demand in counties where CBAS centers existed as of April 1, 2012, the State Medicaid Agency must assure that eligible CBAS beneficiaries that had received CBAS at the closed Center(s) have access to unbundled CBAS as needed for continuity of care and subject to the following general procedur es: 1. Managed care beneficiaries: For managed care beneficiaries who are eligible for CBAS and there is a 5% change from County capacity as of April 1, 2012, in the area, the MCO will authorize unbundled services and facilitate utilization through care coo rdination. 2. Fee-for-Service beneficiaries: For FFS beneficiaries who are eligible for CBAS and there a 5% change from County capacity as of April 1, 2012, in the area, the following procedures will apply: California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 23 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 DHCS will work with the local CBAS Center networ k and beneficiary's physician to identify other available CBAS Centers, and the type, scope and duration of the CBAS the beneficiary needs. DHCS will work with the beneficiary's physician to arrange for o needed nursing services, o referral to, or reassessme nt of, In -Home Supportive Services as needed for personal care services (or authorization of waiver personal care services needed in excess of the IHSS cap). If the beneficiary needs therapeutic services, DHCS will work with the beneficiary's physician to coordinate the authorization of needed services. If the beneficiary needs mental health services, DHCS will work with the beneficiary's physician to refer the beneficiary to the local mental health services program. iv. In the event of a negative change in capacity of 5% or greater in any county for any reason, DHCS shall identify in the quarterly report for the same quarter as the negative change the provider capacity in that county for providing all core and additional CBAS services (as listed in STCs 45(a) and 45(b)) on an unbundled basis . c.

For counties that do not operate a County Organized Health Systems (COHS), the State will ensure that at the time of enrollment, the individuals will have an opportunity to choose from the managed care health plans and providers, if applicable, available to the specific population groups. If the beneficiary does not choose a health plan, they will receive a default plan assignment as described below. For counties that operate a COHS, the State will ensure individuals have a choice of providers, upon enrollment. d. Noticing - Beneficiary and Pro vider Notices and Information Sharing i. Noticing for Cal MediConnect eligible beneficiaries is described in the MOU, the Cal MediConnect three -way contracts, and the enrollment guidance. For beneficiaries that are not a part of the MOU transition, the noticing requirements are described below: A. Initial and On -going Outreach and Communication Strategy . The State shall develop an outreach and education strategy to explain the changes to individuals who are impacted by the Coordinated Care Initiative. The State will establish a stakeholder process to solicit input and recommendations from a broad array of advocates, providers, plans, beneficiaries, and families for the development of a CCI Eligible Beneficiary program. The process will address beneficiary p rotections, person -centered care coordination, consumer - directed IHSS program protections, and quality. The strategy shall describe the State's planned approach for advising individuals regarding health care options utilizing an array of outreach technique s (including in person as needed) to meet the wide spectrum of needs identified within the specific populations. The strategy will further articulate the State's efforts to ensure that the individuals have access to information and human assistance to und erstand the new systems and their choices, their opportunities to select a health plan or particular providers and to achieve continuity and coordination of care. The strategy will include a timeline for initial implementation and on - going operation of th e CCI. All updates or modifications to the outreach and education strategy shall be submitted to CMS for review, prior to implementation. B. CMS Review of Enrollee Communication . The State will submit to CMS, 10 days in advance of finalizing the notice for production, any written communication from the state to enrollees to be used to explain the transition for CMS review and comment. The availability of resources for individual assistance should be clearly set forth in materials developed by both the State and the health plans. The State California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 35 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 will also submit to CMS for review and comment any directional memoranda or guidance documents provided to the counties, plans, and providers. C. Readability and Accessibility . All informing and educational materials should be clear and easy to read, provide information beneficiaries need to help them navigate the transition, and be made available in the 12 Medi -Cal threshold languages, in format s, and at reading levels that ensure materials provide clear information. D. Timing . CCI Eligibles transitioning from Fee -For-Service will be notified at least 90 -days in advance of the effective date of enrollment of upcoming changes in delivery systems; w ill be mailed reminder notices 30 and 60 days prior to enrollment, and final enrollment confirmation notices prior to the enrollment effective date. The State must attempt to contact the beneficiaries who have not made a plan selection by phone, at least t wo times, prior to 15 days before the transition. E. Validation of Beneficiary Addresses . The state will submit to CMS, 45 days in advance of the transition, a comprehensive plan for ensuring mailings will be sent to the most appropriate beneficiary address (this plan should include the use of address validation software). ii. For beneficiaries that are currently enrolled in Medi -Cal managed care and are now going to receive MLTSS through the managed care plan, the noticing requirements are as follows: A. CMS Revie w of Enrollee Communication . The State will require the plans to notify their members at least 30 days in advance of implementation of the benefit.

Approaches to Default i. For CCI Eligible Beneficiaries who are now being mandatorily enrolled in Medi -Cal managed care and do not make an affirmative choice, and after repeated efforts (letter, followed by at least 2 phone calls) to encourage choice, the State will identify individual claims and data (from Medi -Cal and, where appropriate, Medicare) to make a default selection into a plan based on usual and known sources of care, including previous providers (including prescribing providers) , and utilization history. Default enrollees will have the opportunity to see their existing Medi -Cal providers for a period of 12 months after enrollment, as defined by the State. The default shall not occur until education and outreach efforts are cond ucted as noted above. When an assignment cannot be made based on affirmative selection or utilization history, plan assessment shall be based on factors such as plan quality and safety net providers in a plan's network. ii. For individuals currently enrolled in Medi -Cal managed care and who will have MLTSS integrated, the default will be to keep the enrollee in the current Medi -Cal managed care plan. Default enrollees will have the opportunity to change to another Medi -Cal managed care plan, in non -COHS coun ties. iii. The State shall inform individuals of their opportunity to change plans at any time. 56. Benefit Package a. Beneficiaries enrolled in a Medi -Cal managed care plan will receive through the managed care delivery system Medi -Cal benefits as identified in Attachment N - Capitated Services List/Managed Care Benefit Package. Attachment N has been updated to include the long term services and supports as a plan benefit. The State will assure that enrolled individuals have referral and access to State plan s ervices that are excluded from the managed care delivery system but available through a fee for service delivery system, and will also assure referral and coordination with services not included in the established benefit package. The health plans are responsible for referrals and coordination of services in the State Plan, regardless of whether the services are included in the plan benefit package. b. Assessments . The State shall require plans to incorporate into their current policy and procedure a process to assess members who can benefit from LTSS. The plan MLTSS assessment does not preclude the use of specific tools for the determination of eligibility or level of service for MSSP, CBAS and IHSS. i. MSSP Assessment Tool: The plans shall enter into a con tract with each MSSP Site within the county so that the members have their choice of MSSP Site providers. The MSSP Site shall perform assessments and reassessments of potential MSSP beneficiaries pursuant to the 1915(c) California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 37 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Home and Community -Based Waiver CA. 0141.R04.00 requirements. The MSSP Sites will manage their respective waitlists. ii. CBAS Assessment Tool: The State shall ensure that the plans shall comply with STCs 44-51. c. Effective in the authorized CCI counties, managed care benefits for the eligible MLTSS populations will be expanded to include the following long term services and supports (LTSS) as specif ied in Attachment N: i. In-home supportive services (IHSS); ii. Multipurpose Senior Services Program (MSSP) services as defined in the 1915(c) waiver; and iii. Skilled Nursing Facility services and Intermediate Care Facility services. All services will be provide d in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The State will assure compliance with the criteria for home and community based settings as referenced in the regulations implementing 1915(c) and 1915(i) and in accordance with the implement ation/effective dates published in the Federal Register. 57. Efforts to Ensure Seamless Transitions for New CCI Eligible Beneficiaries: The State shall provide data to plans to assist plans in identifying enrollees with complex, multiple, chronic or extensiv e health care needs or high risk enrollees prior to the effective date of coverage. 58. Plan Readiness and Contracts a. Plan Readiness -Ongoing At any time, CMS may require mandatory enrollment freezes based upon review of State reports if it is evident that network adequacy targets are unmet. At any time, CMS reserves the right to withhold approval of contracts/contract amendments and/or Federal financial participation (FFP) if CMS determines that network adequacy is not met. Any available statutory or regulatory appeal procedures will apply. i. Care Coordination . Care coordination activities should reflect the capacity to address the unique needs (medical, support and communication) of individuals in the CCI population and include capacity to provide linkages to other necessary supports outside of each plan's benefit package (e.g., mental health and behavioral health services above and beyond the benefits covered within the plan, personal care, housing, home delivered meals, energy assistance programs, services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities and other supports necessary). The ne eds may be identified through the risk assessment process. Care shall be coordinated across all settings including services outside the provider network and benefit package. ii. MLTSS Assessments . By using the CBAS, IHSS, MSSP, and NF assessment tools, the sta te ensures that these tools include such elements as current health status and treatment needs; social, and transportation needs and preferences; personal goals; participant and caregiver preferences for California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 38 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 care; and back -up plans for situations when caregive rs are unavailable. Additionally by using the CBAS, IHSS, MSSP, and NF assessment tools the state ensures that these instruments are capable of producing a similar assessment result from assessor to assessor (i.e. inter -rater reliability). The State shall direct the plans to engage in a preliminary assessment process that assesses each new enrollee's risk level and needs; assesses the care needs of dual eligible beneficiaries and coordinates their Medi -Cal benefits across all settings; and uses a mechanism or algorithm to determine the health risk level of members. Based on the results of the health risk assessment, the plans shall be directed to develop individual care plans for higher risk beneficiaries. The State shall ensure minimum assessment/screen components to be included in any assessment/screen administered by the plans to enable comparability and standardization of elements considered and included in all plan assessments. iii. Care Continuity : Initial and Ongoing . The State shall ensure that the pla ns have mechanisms to provide continuity of care to enrolled individuals in order to furnish seamless care with existing Medi -Cal providers for a period of 12 months after enrollment and established procedures to bring providers into network. Enrollees ma y keep current CBAS and Nursing Facility providers and services in their approved service plans, even if those providers are not in the network, for 12 months from first day of coverage, or until a service plan is completed and either agreed upon by the enrollee or resolved through the appeals or a fair hearing process and implemented. iv. Person -Centered Planning and Service Design . A. For Medi -Cal only and partial Duals without Medicare Part B, the State shall ensure that all contracts will include an assurance that the plans will have protocols in place to require person -centered planning and treatment approaches for each enrollee. While definitions and models of p erson -centered planning vary, the protocols shall, at a minimum, address the following: 1) How the plan will identify each enrollee's preferences, choices and abilities and the strategies to address those preferences, choices and abilities; 2) How the plan will allow the enrollee to participate fully in any treatment or service planning discussion or meeting, including the opportunity to involve family, friends and professionals of the enrollee's choosing; 3) How the plan will ensure that the enrollee has i nformed choices about treatment and service decisions; and 4) How the planning process will be collaborative, recurring and involve an ongoing commitment to the enrollee. B. For MSSP and all 1915(c) HCBS waiver programs which CCI Eligible Beneficiaries will be enrolled, the service plan will reflect the participant's or caregiver's needs and preferences and address how their needs will be met by a combination of covered services California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 39 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 and available community supports. Person -centered service planning is holistic i n addressing the full array of medical and non - medical services and supports provided both by the health plan or available in the community to ensure the maximum degree of integration and the best possible health outcomes and participant satisfaction. CBO providers will coordinate the HCBS service plan with the health plans service plan. Participants must be permitted to include individuals of their choosing, along with their service providers, as part of their interdisciplinary team. CMS expects particip ants will have the ability to choose which team members should serve as the lead and the participant's main point of contact; if the participant does not want to choose a team lead, the interdisciplinary team will make the decision. v. Physical Accessibilit y. The State will ensure, using the facility site review tool, that each plan has physically accessible accommodations or contingency plans to meet the array of needs of all individuals who require accessible offices, examination or diagnostic equipment an d other accommodations as a result of their disability or condition, and that they are advised of their obligations under the Americans with Disabilities Act and other applicable Federal statutes and rules regarding accessibility. vi. Interpreter Services - Information Technology . The State will ensure that each plan offers interpreter services for individuals who require assistance communicating, as a result of language barriers, disability, or condition.

The State shall continue to ensure that all capitation rates developed for the Medicaid managed care program are actuarially s ound and adequate to meet population needs pursuant to 42 CFR 438.6 (c). Rates will be designed to support the population's ability to support and retain community placement . The state will have a process for oversight and evaluation of payment structures and to inform areas of exploration for future program modifications. ix. Transparency . The State shall require that plan methods for clinical and administrative decision -making are publicl y available in a variety of formats, as well as elements of contractual agreements with the State related to California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 40 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 benefits, assessments, participant safeguards, medical management requirements, and other non -proprietary information related to the provision of services and supports to the LTSS eligible population. The State shall require that each plan utilize its community advisory committee, and that the plans engage in regular meetings with its stakeholder advisory committees. x. Timing . For Medi -Cal only enrollees, the State will ensure that plans are able to serve individuals, including specialty providers, within reasonable and specified timeframes for appointments, including expanded appointment times as needed to meet the individuals ' particular needs. 59. Contract Requirements. Each of the elements noted above as essential to determine plan readiness will be included in the State's contracts with each of the plans in a manner that ensures consistency of services, operations, participant rights and safeguards, quality and access to services. In addition to these elements, the State will ensure that each plan contract contains, for applicable populations . To the extent the plans already comply with any of the following requirements, the s tate shall identify for CMS how they comply. a. For Medi -Cal only and Partial Duals without Medicare Part A .

Within 90 days of legislation in 2016 being passed providing the state with authority, the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) will amend its contract with its External Quality Revie w Organization (EQRO), Health Services Advisory Group, an independent contractor currently under contract with the state and approved by CMS, to complete an Access assessment. If legislative authority is not available the state will need to develop another method for completing this required assessment. This one -time assessment will evaluate primary, core specialty, and facility access to care for managed care beneficiaries based on the current health plan network adequacy requirements set forth in the sta te's Knox -Keene Health Care Service Plan Act of 1975 (KKA) and Medicaid managed care contracts, as applicable. It will consider State Fair Hearing and Independent Medical Review (IMR) decisions, and grievances and appeals/complaints data. It will report on the number of providers accepting new beneficiaries. The state will also establish an Advisory Committee that will provide input into the structure of the Access assessment. a. Design Approval. CMS will approve the Access assessment design, which the state will submit to CMS no later than 180 days after approval by CMS of the EQRO contract amendment. b. Advisory Committee.

Public Hospital Redesign and Incentives in Medi -Cal (PRIME) Program Description. The Public Hospital Red esign and Incentives in Medi -Cal (PRIME) Pool will build upon the foundational delivery system transformation work, expansion of coverage, and increased access to coordinated primary care achieved through the prior California Section 1115 Bridge to Reform demonstration. The activities supported by the PRIME Pool are designed to accelerate efforts by participating PRIME entities (as defined in Attachment D) to change care delivery to maximize health care value and strengthen their ability to successfully perform under risk -based alternative payment models (APMs) in the long term, consistent with CMS and Medi -Cal 2020 goals. The PRIME program is intentionally designed to be ambitious in scope and time -limited. Using evidence -based, quality improvement metho ds, the initial work will require the establishment of performance baselines followed by target setting and the implementation and ongoing evaluation of quality improvement interventions. Participating PRIME entities will consist of two types of entities: Designated Public Hospital (DPH) systems and the District/Municipal Public Hospitals (DMPHs). California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 47 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 PRIME Background The purpose of PRIME program is to support the state's efforts to adopt alternative payment methodologies (APMs) for managed care systems to use to shift risk for costs and/or outcomes to participating PRIME entities. The PRIME program will also provide di rect incentives to partici pating PRIME entities to support better integration of physical and behavioral health serves in inpatient and outpatient settings, improved health outcomes and increased access to health care services, particularly for those with complex health care needs. Funding for the PRIME program will not exceed $7.464 billion in combined federal and state shares of expenditures over a five -year period for DPH system s and DMPHs to support reforms for care delivery, provider organization and the adoption of APMs. The demonstration will provide up to $1.4 billion annually for the DPH system s and up to $200 million annually for the DMPHs for the first three years of the demonstration. The pool will then phase down by 10 percent in the fourth y ear of the demonstration and by an additional 15 percent in the fifth year of the demonstration. Under the PRIME program, DPHs and DMPHs will receive payments for achieving certain outcomes that will build on the successes of the Delivery System Reform Incentive Payments (DSRIP) Program under the Bridge to Reform demonstration. DPHs and DMPHs (that are listed in Attachment D) are eligible to receive incentive payments from the PRIME funding Pool, subject to each DPH system and DMPH submitting a complete d 5-year PRIME Project Plan pursuant to Attachment Q (Five -Year PRIME Project Plan Process). DPHs and DPMHs qualified for PRIME funding pool payments are referred to as \"participating PRIME entities\". Multiple DPHs operating under common government owne rship may be considered a single participating PRIME entity; the same is true for DMPHs. DMPHs may also submit a joint plan for consideration. PRIME incentive payments will support participating PRIME entities in their efforts to change care delivery and strengthen those systems' ability to participate under APMs. As these delivery system changes occur, the state has committed to facilitate movement of participating PRIME entities from payment based on a fee -for-service model to APMs that aligns with HHS' delivery system reform goals where the provider is accountable for quality and cost of care. CMS and the state will measure the success of the PRIME pool in part by assessing the progress in shifting participating DPH PRIME entities to APMs through managed care plans (MCPs). The APMs will shift risk to participating DPH PRIME entities through capitation and other risk sharing arrangements. Contracts between MCPs and participating DPH PRIME providers will be required by the state to include language requiring the DPH to report on a broad range of metrics to meet quality benchmark goals to ensure improved patient outcomes. PRIME innovations and state payment strategies will allow DPHs and DMPHs to become self -sustaining entities that are not reliant on pool funds beyond 2020. To move participating DPH PRIME providers more toward value -based payments, 50 percent of all Medi -Cal managed care beneficiaries assigned to DPHs by their MCP, in the aggregate, will receive all of or a portio n of their care under a contracted APM by January 2018 (DY 13); 55 percent by January 2019 (DY 14); and 60 percent by the end California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 48 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 of the waiver renewal period in 2020 (DY 15). Under PRIME, capitated payments, and other acceptable APMs, would be included to ca pture all models of APM utilized in calcu lations that determine overall DPH system advancement toward the established thresholds. Four tiers of capitated or alternative payment would exist: 1) partial (primary care only); 2) partial -plus (primary care and some specialty care (varies)); 3) global (primary, specialty, ancillary and/or hospital care); and 4) additional payment methodologies approved by the state and CMS as set forth in Attachment R. The PRIME program is focused on the following goals: (1) inc reasing the capabilities of participating PRIME entities to furnish patient -centered, data -driven, team -based care to Medi -Cal beneficiaries, especially those who are high utilizers or at risk of becoming high utilizers (2) improving the capacity of partic ipating PRIME entities to provide point - of-care services, complex care management, and population health management by strengthening their data analytic capacity to drive system -level improvement and culturally competent care; (3) Improve population health and health outcomes for Medi - Cal beneficiaries served by participating PRIME entities , as evidenced by the achievement of performance goals related to clinical improvements, effective preventive interventions, and improved patient experience metrics; (4) improving the ability of participating PRIME entities to furnish, in the most appropriate setting, high -quality, care that integrates physical and behavioral health services and coordinates care in different settings for targeted vulnerable Medi -Cal benef iciaries, ; and (5) moving participating PRIME entities towards value -based payments through the adoption of alternative payment models. 71. Domains. The PRIME funds provide incentive payments to participating PRIME entities that undertake 5 -year projects within Domains 1, 2, and 3 as described below and consistent with the PRIME Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol . DPHs will be required to implement projects under all three domains. DMPHs, given their different demographics, including their size and l ocation, are only required to include a project from a single domain, although they may include additional projects from other domains in their application for consideration. DMPHs may also submit a joint application across DMPHs reflecting a coordinated effort to implement a domain. There will be a core required set of metrics for each project that will be outlined in Attachment Q: PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol by March 1 , 2016. The specific elements will be particular to the project and to the needs of the beneficiaries Incentive payments will be phased down consistent with the overall PRIME phase down in DY 14 and DY 15. The applications for these projects will need t o outline how they will be building infrastructure and alignment designed to support sustainability over the course of the 5 years including how they will sustain project innovations in years DY 14 and DY 15 as PRIME funding is phased down. a. Domain 1: Out patient Delivery System Transformation and Prevention. The PRIME funds provide incentive payments to participating PRIME entities that undertake projects that will ensure that patients experience timely access to high - quality, efficient, and patient -centered care. Through these efforts patients will receive appropriate preventive services, early diagnosis and treatment, and will be California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 49 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 supported in improving their ability to care for themselves through access to other needed services including those that sup port social and well -being needs. In addition, these projects will identify and increase rates of cost -effective standard approaches to prevention services for a select group of high impact clinical conditions and populations (cardiovascular disease, brea st, cervical and colorectal cancer, and obesity). They will also aim to reduce disparities and variation in performance of targeted prevention services within their systems. Under this domain, DPHs will be required to participate in Integration of Physica l and Behavioral Health; Ambulatory Care Redesign: Primary Care; Ambulatory Care Redesign: Specialty Care; and must choose one additional project. The menu of proj ects under this domain include: i. Integration of Physical and Behavioral Health (required for DPHs) ii. Ambulatory Care Redesign: Primary Care (required for DPHs) iii. Ambulatory Care Redesign: Specialty Care (required for DPHs) iv. Patient Safety i n the Ambulatory Settin g v. Million Hearts Initiative vi. Cancer Screening and Follow -up vii. Obesity Prevention and Healthier Foods Initiative b. Domain 2: Targeted High -Risk or High -Cost Populations. The PRIME funds provide incentive payments to participating PRIME entities that undertake projects focused on specific populations that would benefit most significantly from care integration and alignment. Particular attention will be focused on managing and coordinating care during transitions from inpatient to outpatient and post -acute settings, to optimize the care experience and outcomes. Under this domain, DPHs would be requir ed to participate in Improved Perinatal Care, Care Transitions: Integration of Post -Acute Care and Complex Care Management for High Risk Medical Populations and must choose one additional project. The menu of projects under this domain include: i. Improved Perinatal Care (required for DPHs) ii. Care Transitions: Integration of Post -Acute Care (required for DPHs) iii. Complex Care Management for High Risk Medical Populations (Required for DPHs) iv. Integrated Health Home for Foster Children v. Transition to Integrated Care: Post Incarceration. vi. Chronic Non -Malignant Pain Management vii. Comprehensive Advanced Illness Planning and Care c. Domain 3: Resource Utilization Efficiency. The PRIME funds provide incentive payments to participating PRIME entities that undertake projects that will reduce unwarranted variation in the use of evidence -based, diagnostics and treatments (antibiotics, blood or blood products, and high cost imaging studies and pharmaceutical therapies) targeting overuse, misuse, as well as inappropriate underuse of effective interventions. Projects will also eliminate the use of ineffective or harmful targeted clinical services. DPHs must select at least one of the projects below. The menu of projects under this domain include: California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 50 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 i. Antibiotic Stewardship ii. Resource Stewardship: High Cost Imaging iii. Resource Stewardship: Therapies Involving High Cost Pharmaceuticals iv. Resource Stewardship: Blood Products. Project selection f or each participating PRIME entity must include an assessment of the number of patients benefiting from, and magnitude of health improvement achievable by, the project selected, pursuant to the PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol. Participating PRIME enti ties shall not select projects for which the target population is insufficient to accurately measure success and shall not select optional projects to which they are considered \"top performers\" based on their baseline performance level compared to the proj ect benchmarks identified in the PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol. If a participating PRIME entity is ineligible to select a project on the basis of the above criteria, the participating PRIME entity will be required to choose another project from the same domain as necessary to fulfill program minimum project requirements. 72. Statewide APM Targets for DPHs. To ensure support for sustainability beyond the demonstration DPHs must demonstrate, in the aggregate, a shift from a fee for service to value -based managed care payments by 2020. Generally this will be in the form of capitation, though other APMs may be acceptable. APMs must provide payment at the provider level that is, tied to value and quality and provide incentives to clinicians to provide the ri ght care, at the right time, at the right place. a. Methodology: PRIME is structured to chart a path towards integrating continuous quality improvement in the underlying structure of the Medi -Cal program. This will be evidenced by an increasing shift of man aged care payments for DPHs towards APMs, which include full or partial capitation of services, risk -pool payments or other risk -sharing arrangements at the provider level for assigned Medi -Cal managed care enrollees. i. In determining whether DPH system s are progressing towards the APM targets stipulated above, the following methodology will be used: A. Determine the total number of unique MCP beneficiaries who either choose or are assigned to all of the participating DPH system s in aggregate for the applicable demonstration year. B. Determine the total number of unique MCP beneficiaries who either choose or are assigned to all participating DPHs in the aggregate for which the contract between the MCP and DPH prescribes that a portion of the payment from the MCP to the DPH system is in the form of capitation or some other APM, as described in Attachment R. Both partial and global capitation payments, as well as other accepted forms of risk sharing will be included in calculations to determine aggregate DPH progress toward the established thresholds to capture all models of APM utilized. Accepted forms of APM would be classified into four tiers of payment: 1) partial (primary care only); 2) partial -plus (primary care and some specialty care (varies)); 3) global (primar y, specialty, ancillary and/or hospital care); and 4) any additional California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 51 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 payment methodologies approved by the state and by CMS as set forth in Attachment R. C. Divide the result of B by A to determine the percentage met. b. Definition of \"alternative payment model :\" An APM should include the following features: i. A defined patient population the DPH is accountable for, defined through assignment either by DHCS or by a managed care plan. ii. A set of quality accountability metrics that are aligned with the contracted MCPs quality accountability and clinical outcome metrics, but with adjustments to reflect the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the populations served by PRIME entities where possible. iii. Some contractual level of risk for cost of ca re. This accountability does not need to be full risk capitation, but must include a form of risk sharing, incentives or shared savings for reduced cost iv. Models that lack one or more of these three features will not qualify as an APM. v. The above APM targe ts are intended to inform CMS and DHCS in their oversight function as to the level of success the DPHs have had in facilitating the adoption of robust APMs for Medi -Cal. DPHs will be required to commit to contracting with at least one Medi -Cal MCP in the MCP service area that they operate using APM methodologies as part of their PRIME Project Plan by January 1, 2018. If a DPH is unable to meet this requirement and can demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to contract with an MCP in the service ar ea that it operates in and a gap in contract period occurs, DHCS has discretion to waive this requirement. 73. Eligible Participating PRIME Entities. DPH systems (which include their affiliated governmental providers and contracted governmental and non -gove rnmental entities where applicable ) and DMPHs, that are identified in Appendix D are eligible to receive PRIME incentive payments, subject to each DPH system or DMPH submitting a completed 5 -year PRIME Project Plan. Multiple DPHs operating under common gov ernment ownership may be considered a single participating PRIME entity , or may submit separate applications and be treated as separate participating PRIME enti ties. Multiple DMPHs operating under common government ownership may submit separate application s; however, a lead DMPH must be identified . Incentive funds shall be disbursed solely to eligible DPH systems or DMPHs. A specified amount of incentive funding will be available annually to each participating PRIME entity based on the metrics appr oved fo r that entity or, to the extent that the entity is participating as a DMPH, the metrics approved for the associated DMPHs under common government ownership . The actual receipt of funds will be conditioned on reporting by the entity of progress towards and achievement of the specified metrics approved for the defined population of beneficiaries. Aside from early stage process metrics, awards in later years will be based on per beneficiary measures of improvement. Additional criteria for participation shall be outlined in Attachment II. a. Designated Public Hospitals (DPHs). Twenty -one DPHs operate 17 health and hospital systems, with one system comprised of four hospitals in Los Angeles California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 52 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 County. DPHs are located in mostly urban areas in Northern, Central and Southern California. These hospitals range in size from approximately 160 to 600 beds. DPHs are similar in that they are academic teaching centers providing a broad range of inpatient and outpatient services including specialty care. More than 50 percent o f patients served across these health and hospital systems are Medi -Cal beneficiaries or uninsured. DPHs provide 30 percent of all hospital -based care to the Medi -Cal population in the state and operate more than half of the state's trauma centers and more than two -thirds of its burn centers. b. District/Municipal Hospitals (DMPHs). There are 39 DMPHs spanning 19 counties across California. DMPHs are heterogeneous, varying significantly in size (from approximately 3 to 500 beds) and in the range of services pr ovided. Many of these hospitals serve rural and semi -rural populations. Approximately 21 percent of patients served at DMPHs are Medi -Cal or uninsured and more than a third of the DMPHs provide over 30 percent of their care to low -income Californians, with some facilities treating as many as 50 percent low -income Californians. DMPHs provide 4 percent of the hospital -based care to the Medi -Cal and uninsured populations in California and 20 percent of the care provided to these populations in rural California . 74. State and Participating PRIME Entity Accountability. Overall PRIME project funding is available up to the amounts specified in the PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol. PRIME funding is available to participating PRIME entities whose project plans are approved and funded through the process described in these STCs and who meet particular metrics' targets described in their approved PRIME project plans. Such funding is subject to the participating PRIME entities meeting ongoing metrics' targets establis hed pursuant to the PRIME projects and Metrics Protocol, metrics as described in the STCs and PRIME Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment II ). In addition, individual participating PRIME entity achievement of metrics as set forth in the appro ved PRIME Project Plan must be achieved and maintained for full access to the funding level as specified in the STCs. a. The state must achieve APM targets to avoid reductions to PRIME funding. If the state fails to meet the specified APM targets in any gi ven year, the amount of the potential reduction is set as follows: 1) Based on the methodology measuring aggregate adoption of APM described in STC 3, the DPH portion of the PRIME pool will have 5 percent of the yearly allocated pool amount at risk in DY14, a nd 5 percent at risk in DY15. 2) Each year's potential reduction will consist of two portions. First, 2.5 percent of the pool amount will be contingent on aggregate adoption of the DY14 and DY15 goals of 55 percent and 60 percent APM adoption, respectively. The other 2.5 percent of the penalty would occur if providers fail to meet the aggregate 55 percent or 60 percent thresholds, and fail to meet a lesser aggregate APM adoption rate of 45 percent and 50 percent for DY14 and California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 53 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 DY15. The state may choose how to allocate reductions in the PRIME pool to providers, whether uniformly, with more of the reduction targeted to providers that substantially fail to meet targets, or another methodology if desired. b. Individual projects are awarded based on the merit of the proposal itself, its support of the overall PRIME goals, and the projected breadth and depth of the impact on Medicaid beneficiaries. Public transparency, a process that allows for community input, including two public meetings, will be part of the state application and review process. 75. Application Process. Five -year PRIME Project Plan. DPHs must include projects from all three domains and contain the specific elements as required under PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol. DMPHs, given their different dem ographics, including their size and location, are only required to include a project from a single domain; DMPHs may include additional projects in their application. DMPHs may also submit a joint application across DMPHs reflecting a coordinated effort to implement a domain. a. DHCS will review all 5 -year PRIME project plans for final approval according to the following timeline: i. By February 1, 2016, or 30 days after approval of PRIME protocols (whichever is later) each applicant will submit a 5 -year PRIME Project plan to DHCS for review. DPHs will be required to address Domains 1, 2, and 3, and DMPHs will be required to address o ne domain at a minimum. ii. By March 15, 2016, or 45 days, whichever is later, after the submission of the 5 -year PRIME project plans, DHCS will complete its review of the 5 - year PRIME Project Plan, and will respond to the applicant in writing with any quest ions, concerns or problems identified. iii. The participating PRIME entity will respond to any of DHCS' questions and concerns in writing within 3 business days of notification by DHCS. iv. By April 1, 2016, or 60 days, whichever is later, following the submission of the 5 -year PRIME project plans, DHCS will take action on the PRIME Project Plan and will approve or disapprove each plan. 76. PRIME Protocols. Specific standards, measures and evaluation guide lines are described in protocols. Specifically, the protoco ls are described in Attachments II and Q (PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol and PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol), which accomplish the following: a. Detail requirements regarding project metrics (PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol); b. Identify metrics, m easurement of the metrics, and a target setting methodology (PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol); c. Provide parameters for establishing the allocation of incentive funding among participating PRIME entities, which may consider size of the facilities, scope of the public hospital system, geography, number of people served, and complexity of services provided, among other factors (PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol); California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 54 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 d. Finalize payment mechanisms and disbursement of pool funds (PRIME Funding and Mechanics Prot ocol); e. Finalize a State review process that will assure action on the Five -year PRIME Project Plan within 60 days of submission from the participating PRIME entity; f. Detail a Five -year PRIME Project Plan modification process (PRIME Projects and Metrics Pr otocol); g. Finalize requirements for reporting (PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol); h. Describe evaluation requirements for the program (PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol) 77. PRIME Program Objectives and Metrics. Progress towards achieving the goals specifi ed above will be assessed by specific metrics for each project, which are further defined in the PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol. Metric achievement will be based on documenting achievement on a set of pre -defined metrics through a method that can be audited. These metrics are organized into the following categories: a. PRIME Program Objectives : The PRIME projects will be designed in ways that promote health systems participating PRIME entities assuming responsibility for the overall health needs of a population of the Medi -Cal beneficiaries and the low income individuals that they serve, and not simply responding to the patients that arrive at the doors of a hospital. DHCS will approve a defined population for each PRIME project, as described in PRIME Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol. b. Integration Across Settings: The PRIME will further the transformation of patient care systems to create strong links between different settings in which care is provided, including inpatient and outpatient settin gs, institutional and community based settings, and importantly behavioral and physical health providers. The PRIME will support coordination and the provision of care for patients across the spectrum of settings in order to promote health and better outc omes, particularly for populations at risk. The PRIME projects Pool will fund projects that include new and expanded care coordination programs, other evidence based, data driven interventions and programs focused on key health and cost drivers. PRIME program metrics will reflect this ongoing t ransformation, creating better alignment between providers and rewarding providers for improved outcomes. c. Transition to APM: The transition to APM models in which both partial and global capitation payments and o ther approved APMS would be included in calculations to determine overall DPH achievement of the established thresholds to capture all models of APM utilized. d. PRIME Project Metrics: All participating PRIME entities will produce an interim mid-year and fi nal year report on metric progress specific to the participating PRIME entity's project and its PRIME defined population. Payment for performance on all PRIME metrics will be based on an objective demonstration of improvement over a baseline, using a vali d, standardized method. PRIME participating entities that already demonstrate high performance on project metrics at baseline, must select alternative projects (as defined in PRIME Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 55 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Funding and Mechanics Protocol but within the same domain so to ful fill minimum project requirements, if all projects from the domain are not already included under the PRIME Project Plan. Improvement targets will be based on state or national performance benchmarks, whenever available, but with adjustments to reflect the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the populations served by PRIME entities where possible . e. Standard Metrics : These metrics include both System Transformation and Health and Health Care Improvement metrics, and are national and state vetted metrics. The majority of metrics in this category are National Quality Forum (NQF) endorsed. The remaining have an established measure steward, such as National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) or CMS, who have used rigorous metric vetting processes to establish use of the metrics for performance measurement and financial accountability of performance. f. System Transformation Metrics : As detailed in the PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol, these metrics reflect the processes and infrastructure necessary to build and strengthen high quality, integrated, patient centered delivery systems, including outcomes that reflect overall improvement in systems of care, care coordination, care integration and patient experience. g. Health and Health Care Outcome Metrics : As described further in PRIME Projects and Metrics Protocol, these are metrics that reflect improved quality of care, as well as the resulting improved clinical outcomes for each participating entity's PRIME defined population. These metrics will also me asure each participating PRIME entity's success in reducing avoidable emergency department and hospital use by its defined population. h. Innovative Metrics : As with the Standard Metrics referenced above, this category includes System Transformation Metrics, and Health and Health Care Outcome Metrics. While representing a much smaller proportion of the total PRIME metrics than the Standard Metrics, this catego ry enables participating PRIME entities to demonstrate the transformation of health care towards coordinated, team based, patient centered care, in a manner not afforded by many of the Standard Metrics. As with the Standard Metrics, each PRIME Innovative m etric will have only one definition and measure specification across the entire PRIME program. Beginning as reporting only, these metrics will be guided by its PRIME participating entity measure steward and a PRIME Metric Technical Advisory Committee, thro ugh a rigorous evaluation and testing process to be developed by DHCS as described in the PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol. Once through that process, participating PRIME entities will be responsible for improving performance on these metrics. Final ap proval of all innovative metrics is determined by DHCS, but the final metrics must be provided to CMS for comment before approval. 78. State Supporting Infrastructure . DHCS will provide a state -level infrastructure to support the PRIME. The state -level infras tructure will be implemented incrementally over the five - years of the Demonstration. The state -level infrastructure will include: a. Information and Data Sharing. Achieving care integration across Medi -Cal delivery systems is a priority for the state. I n particular, since managed care has become the California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 56 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 predominant delivery mode serving 90 percent of all full -scope Medi -Cal members, data linkages and care coordination among MCPs and other partners such as participating PRIME entities is critical. As such, DP Hs will be required to strengthen data and information sharing with MCPs under the PRIME. To support this requirement, DHCS will establish data and information sharing guidelines and/or mechanisms, consistent with applicable state and federal data privacy and security law, to provide for timely sharing of beneficiary data, assessment, and treatment information, for purposes of identifying and treating the beneficiary for PRIME and WPC. b. Medi -Cal Managed Care Health Plans (MCPs). The state must also ensu re that its managed care delivery system recognizes and encourages positive system transformation. The state will develop a draft MCP and DPH APM Activities Plan, consistent with APMs as defined under these STCs and in Attachment R, by January 1, 2017. The document will outline activities that the state will engage in to support MCPs and DPHs in the adoption of APMs, establishing methods for the state to achieve the APM targets as set forth under these STCs. DHCS will share the draft MCP and DPH APM Act ivities Plan with MCPs, DPHs, and other stakeholders for public comment and feedback In addition, the state will convene a minimum of one meeting with MCPs and DPHs annually to discuss movement toward use of APMs, share best practices, and discuss successe s, challenges and barriers. DHCS will include in its full -scope managed care contracts language that allows for the implementation of APMs. This language will be required to be included in any participating network provider contract where quality improvement work has been delegated. The language will clarify that APM payments to DPHs are funded through the capitation payments made to MCPs (without separate PRIME funding). MCPs will be required to require DPHs, as a component of an agreement for ca pitation or other risk - sharing payments, to utilize PRIME projects, goals, and objectives, to assist the MCP in meeting its DHCS required quality metric thresholds; reporting on metrics and performance to the MCP will also be required. DHCS will issue a po licy letter that encourages MCPs to adopt APM payment structures for DPHs and other participating network providers, and which provides guidance on the various APM structures that may be implemented including the four tiers as set forth in the PRIME STCs. DHCS will convene meetings with its MCPs to discuss information relating to APMs and promote the sharing of best practices amongst MCPs. 79. PRIME Transparency. During the 60 day application/state review process for the PRIME applications, DHCS must have cond ucted at least two public meetings regarding the state's PRIME Project Plan application approval. The state must utilize teleconferencing or web capabilities to ensure statewide accessibility. The two public meetings must be held on separate dates and mus t afford the public an opportunity to provide comments. 80. Administrative Record. CMS will maintain, and publish on its public Web site, an administrative record that may include, but is not limited to the following: California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 57 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 a. The PRIME application from the partici pating PRIME entities. b. Written public comments sent to the CMS and any CMS responses. c. If an application is approved, the final special terms and conditions, waivers, expenditure authorities, and award letter sent to the state. d. If an application is denied, the disapproval letter sent to the state. e. The state acceptance letter, as applicable. f. Specific requirements related to the approved and agreed upon terms and conditions, such as implementation reviews, evaluation design, quarterly progress reports, annual reports, and interim and/or final evaluation reports. g. Notice of the demonstration's suspension or termination, if applicable. CMS will provide sufficient documentation to address substantive issues relating to the approval documentation that should compr ehensively set forth the basis, purpose, and conditions for the approved demonstration. 81. Submission of Draft Evaluation Design. The state shall submit a draft PRIME evaluation design to CMS no later than 180 days after the PRIME protocols are approved, including, but not limited to data that the state proposes to be used to evaluate PRIME. The state must employ meaningful state -level standards that align with its managed care approach. 82. Submission of Final Evaluation Design. The state shall provide the Final Evaluation Design within 60 days of receipt of CMS comments of the Draft Evaluation Design. If CMS finds that the Final E valuation Design adequately accommodates its comments, then CMS will approve the Final Evaluation Design and the final evaluation plan will be included as Attachment S. 83. Evaluation Requirements. The state shall engage the public in the development of its evaluation design. The evaluation design shall incorporate an interim and summative evaluation and will discuss the following requirements as they pertain to each: a. The scientific rigor of the analysis; b. A discussion of the goals, objectives and specific h ypotheses that are to be evaluated; c. Specific performance and outcomes measures used to evaluate PRIME's impact; d. How the analysis will support a determination of improved health outcomes and system transformation including better care, better quality, and e nhanced value; e.

The demonstration evaluation will use the best avail able data; use controls (when available and appropriate for the evaluation design) and adjustments for and California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 58 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 reporting of the limitations of data and their effects on results; and discuss the generalizability of results. k. The state shall contract with an inde pendent entity to conduct the evaluation. The evaluation design shall discuss the state's process for obtaining an independent entity to conduct the evaluation, including a description of the qualifications the entity must possess, how the state will assu re no conflict of interest, and a budget for evaluation activities. 84. Evaluation Design. The Evaluation Design shall include the following core components to be approved by CMS: a. Specific aims and hypotheses: This includes a statement of the specific research questions and testable hypotheses that address the goals of the demonstration, including: b. Safety net system transformation at the system and state level; c. Accountability for and improvements in health outcomes and other health measures at the system and state level; and d. Efforts to ensure sustainability of transformation of/in the managed care environment. The research evaluation questions will be examined using appropriate compar isons. The state and CMS agree that a robust evaluation of PRIME is desired in order to, to the greatest extent possible, determi ne the causal impacts of PRIME. The state and CMS will work to identify available data sources in order to allow for this typ e of evaluation, including data sources that would provide the ability to use control and comparison groups, where available, as wel l as before -and-after studies. The design will include a description of the quantitative and qualitative study design includ ing a rationale for the design selected. The discussion will include a proposed baseline and approach to comparison. The discussion will include approach to benchmarking, and should consider applicability of national and state standards. The application of sensitivity analyses as appropriate shall be considered. e. Performance Measures: This includes identification, for each hypothesis, of quantitative and/or qualitative process and/or outcome measures that adequately assess the effectiveness of the Demonstration in terms of cost or cost avoidance impact, change in delivery of care from inpatient to outpatient, quality improvement, and transformation of incentive arrangements. Nationally recognized measures should be used where appropriate. Measures will be clearly stated and described, with the numerator and dominator clearly defined. To the extent possible, the state will incorporate comparisons to national data and/or measure sets. A broad set of metrics will be selected. To the extent possible, metrics will be pulled from nationally recognized metrics such as from the NQF, Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI), meaningful use under Health Information Technology (HIT), and the Medicaid Core Adult sets, for which there is sufficient experience and baseline population data to make the metrics a meaningful evaluation of the California Medicaid system. f. Data Collection: This discussion shall include: A description of the data sources; California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 59 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 the frequency and timing of data collection; and the method of data collection.

Payments can be earned and disbursed based on mid - year and year -end achievements. 100. Monitoring. The state will be actively involved in ongoing monitoring of PRIME projects, including but not limited to the following activities. a. Review of metric tar get achievement. Two times per year, participating PRIME entities seeking payment under the PRIME program shall submit reports to the state demonstrating progress on each of their projects as measured by project - specific metrics and targets achieved during the reporting period. The reports shall be submitted using the standardized reporting mechanism approved by the state and CMS. Based on the reports, the state will calculate the incentive payments for the progress achieved according to the approved PRIM E Project Plan, in accordance with the established criteria as set forth in Attachment II. The participating PRIME entities shall have available for review by the state or CMS, all supporting data and back -up documentation. These reports will serve as the basis for authorizing incentive payments to participating providers for achievement of PRIME metrics. The reports will be due in accordance with the California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 63 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 following: i. Interim Mid -Year Report: Reporting on metrics through December 31. The report and request fo r payment is due March 31, with payment occurring no later than April 30. For PRIME DY 11 only, the submission of the Five -year PRIME Project Plan will constitute the submission of the Interim Mid -Year Report. ii. Final Year - End Report: Reporting on metrics through June 30. The report and request for payment is due September 30, with payment occurring no later than October 31. iii. Notwithstanding the deadlines in i and ii, in the event of misreported or insufficient data, DHCS reporting and payment deadlines wit h respect to a participating PRIME entity may be extended by up to 60 days until its reports are adequately corrected for approval for payment. If the data is not fixed and payment is not made within that extended time frame, the participating provider wi ll not receive any PRIME payment for the period in question. Except with respect to the PRIME DY 11 Mid -Year Report, the reports must be submitted using the standardized reporting mechanism approved by CMS. DHCS must use this documentation in support of PRIME Pool payments made on the MBES/CBES 64.9 Waiver form. For PRIME DY11, approval of the Five -year PRIME project plans will be considered an appropriate metric and serve in -lieu of the mid -year report and will equal up to 25 percent of the PRIME DY 11 total annual amount for which a participating PRIME entity is eligible. b. Intergovernmental Transfers. Within 30 days of submission of the mid -year and final year -end report by participating PRIME entities, DHCS will issue requests to the entities for inter governmental transfer amounts necessary for the nonfederal share of applicable incentive payments. DPH systems or DMPHs, or their affiliated public agencies, will make intergovernmental transfer of funds to DHCS in the amount specified within 7 days of re ceiving the DHCS request. Upon receipt of the intergovernmental transfers, DHCS will draw the federal funding and pay both the non -federal and federal shares of the payment to lead DPH systems or DMPHs as applicable. If the intergovernmental transfers ar e made within the requested timeframe, the incentive payment will be paid within 14 days after the transfer s are made, but in no event shall payment be made later than the dates specified in a. above. In the event of misreported or insufficient data, DHCS will not be bound to the 30 day payment timeline with respect to a participating PRIME entity until its reports are adequately corrected for approval for payment , consistent with (a)(iii) above . In the event federal approval is not obtained, DHCS must re turn the IGT funds to the transferring entities within 14 days. c. Learning collaboratives . As part of this demonstration, the state will work in collaboration with participating PRIME entities to support regular learning California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 64 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 collaboratives, which will be a required activity for all participating PRIME entities, and may be organized by the goals of PRIME or by the specific PRIME projects as described in the PRIME Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol . Learning collaboratives are forums for participating PRIM E entities to share best practices and get assistance with implementing their PRIME projects. Learning collaboratives should primarily be focused on learning (through exchange of ideas at the front lines) rather than teaching (i.e. large conferences), but the state should coordinate with participating PRIME entities to organize at least one face -to-face statewide collaborative meeting a year. Learning collaboratives should be supported by a web site to help participating PRIME entities share ideas and simple data over time (which should not need to be developed from scratch). In addition, the collaboratives should be supported by individuals with training in quality improvement who can answer practical questions about implementation and harvest good ideas and practices that they systematically spread to others. d. Application, review, oversight, and monitoring database . The state will ensure that there is a well maintained and structured database, containing all required elements of the PRIME project plans ; including metrics, targets, valuation, and achievement; public comment on project plans; generations of reports, containing the required elements of PRIME reporting and payments and summaries of PRIME project plans submissions, scoring, approval/denial, milestone achievement, and payments that can be accessed by the public. 101. Financial Requirements applying to PRIME payments generally. a. Funding for DPH systems (total computable) shall not exceed $6.531 billion over five years with the following annual limits: DY 11 - $1.4 billion DY 12 - $1.4 billion DY 13 - $1.4 billion DY 14 - $1.26 billion DY 15 - $1.071 billion b. Funding for DMPHs (total computable) shall not exceed $933 million over five years with the following annual limits: DY 11 - $200 million DY 12 - $200 million DY 13 - $200 million DY 14 - $180 million DY 15 - $153 million c. A specified amount of incentive funding will be available semi -annually to each participating PRIME entity for each approved project based on its progress or achievement of the metric targets approved for the project. The actual receipt of funds will be conditioned on reporting by the entity of progress towards and California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 65 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 achievement of the specified targets to DHCS. Each participating PRIME entity will be indivi dually responsible for progress towards and achievement of the targets for its projects within applicable domains in order to receive its potential incentive funding from the PRIME Sub -Pool, pursuant to the procedures specified in Attachment II (PRIME Fund ing and Mechanics Protocol). The inability of one participating PRIME entity to meet a specified target will not preclude another participating PRIME entity's receipt of incentive payment for achievement of a separate target. d. PRIME shall also include mec hanisms that recognize the ability of a participating PRIME entity to earn a reduced incentive payment based on proportionate achievement that is at least 50 percent of a designated target as set forth in Attachment II (PRIME Funding and Mechanics Protocol ). e. Notwithstanding the annual limits set forth in a. above, participating PRIME entities will have the opportunity to recapture unused or unclaimed PRIME pool payments as detailed in Attachment II (PRIME Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol). f. Incentive payments will be based on the incentive payment amounts that are specified in each participating PRIME entity's approved five -year PRIME Project Plan, and not to the specific costs or resources involved in implementing the specific projects. g. Incentive p ayment amounts will be phased down as necessary consistent with the overall PRIME phase down in DY 14 and DY 15. h. PRIME Payments Are Not Direct Reimbursement for Expenditures or Payments for Services . Payments from the PRIME Pool are intended to support and reward participating entities for improvements in the delivery system that support the simultaneous pursuit of improving the experience of care, improving the health of populations, and reducing pe r capita costs of health care, and are unrestricted revenue once disbursed. The payments are not direct reimbursement for expenditures incurred by participating entities in implementing reforms. The payments are not reimbursement for health care services that are recognized under these Special Terms and Conditions or under the State plan. PRIME incentive payments should not be considered patient care revenue and should not be offset against the certified public expenditures incurred by government -operate d health care systems and their affiliated government entity providers for health care services, dispropor tionate share hospital payments or administrative activities as defined under these Special Terms and Conditions and/or under the State plan. The payments do not offset payment amounts otherwise payable to and by MCPs for Medi -Cal beneficiaries, or supplant provider payments from MCPs. The non -federal share of payments under PRIME shall be funded by voluntary intergovernmental transfers made by t he participating PRIME entities and/or California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 66 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 applicable governmental agencies. The funding entity shall certify that the funds transferred qualify for federal financial participation pursuant to 42 C.F.R. part 433 subpart B, and are not derived from impermissib le sources such as recycled Medicaid payments, federal money excluded from use as State match, impermissible taxes, and non -bona fide provider -related donations. The State must have permissible sources for the non -federal share of PRIME expenditures, whic h may include permissible Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs) from government - operated entities and state funds. Sources of non -federal funding shall not include provider taxes or donations impermissible under section 1903(w), impermissible intergovernment al transfers from providers, or federal funds received from federal programs other than Medicaid (unless expressly authorized by federal statute to be used for claiming purposes, and the federal Medicaid funding is credited to the other federal funding sou rce). For this purpose, federal funds do not include PRIME payments, patient care revenue received as payment for services rendered under programs such as the Designated State Health Programs, Medicare, or Medicaid. i. The state must inform CMS of the fundi ng of all PRIME payments to providers through a quarterly payment report to be submitted to CMS within 60 days after the end of each quarter, as required under STC 95 of this section. This report must identify the applicable transferring entities and tran sfer amounts associated with the quarterly payments made. j. The state will ensure that any lack of adequate funds from local sources will not result in lowering the amount, duration, scope or quality of Medicaid services available under the state plan or th is demonstration. The preceding sentence is not intended to preclude the state from modifying the Medicaid benefit through the state plan amendment process. k. The state may not claim FFP for PRIME Payments to a participating PRIME entity until the state have concluded that the participating PRIME entity has met the relevant performance indicated for the payment. Participating PRIME entity reports must contain sufficient data and documentation to allow the state and CMS to determine if the specified metri c targets have been fully met, and participating PRIME entities must have available for review by the state or CMS, upon request, all supporting data and back -up documentation. FFP will be available only for payments pursuant to an approved PRIME Project Plan. l. Semi -annually, when the State makes PRIME Payments and claims FFP, appropriate supporting documentation will be made available for CMS to determine the appropriate amount of the payments. This documentation should be used to support claims made for FFP for PRIME Payments that are made on the CMS -64.9 Waiver forms. It should be noted that federal funding for PRIME payments is limited in any phase of the demonstration period to the amounts set forth in this demonstration California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 67 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 authority, subject to all of the reductions that may be applied based on incomplete achievement of PRIME Plan metrics, even if the state expenditures for PRIME payments exceed the amount for which federal funding is available . 102. Finalize PRIME Protocols. Within the 60 days following the acceptance of the terms and conditions, CMS and the State will, through a collaborative process, develop and finalize the PRIME Projec ts and Metrics Protocol ( Attachment Q) and PRIME Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol (future Attachment II). The state may not accept a PRIME application until after CMS formally approval of these protocols. 103. Deliverables Schedule. Due Date/Submission Date Activity/Deliverable December 31, 2015 CMS approves STCs 60 days post Demonstration approval CMS and CA approve PRIME attachments February 1, 2016 ( or 30 days post approval of PRIME attachments, whichever is later ) State accepts PRIME project plan applications from eligible PRIME entities 45 days post submission of PRIME Project Plans State will com plete its review of the applica tions and issue questions, concerns or problems to the PRIME entity applicant 60 days post submission of PRIME Project Plans State will take action of the PRIME Project applications to approve or disapprove During the 60 day peri od between PRIME Project Plan Submission and State Approval/Disapproval During the 60 day application/state review process for the PRIME applications, DHCS must have conducted at least two public meetings regarding the state's PRIME Project Plan applicatio n approval June 1, 2016 State submits its first quarterly report April and October (Twice a year) State Distributes PRIME Project Plan incentive payments to PRIME participating entities 90 days following completion of demonstration Year 14 State submits Draft Interim Evaluation report 180 days after the expiration of the demonstration State submits preliminary Summative Evaluation report 360 days after the expiration of the demonstration State submits Draft Final Summative Evaluation report Quarterly Deliverables - Quarterly Report (60 days after end of the quarter) 1st Quarter - June 1st 2nd Quarter - September 1st 3rd Quarter - December 1st 4th Quarter - March 3rd 104. Special Terms and Conditions for Dental Transformation Initiative Under the Medi -Cal program, dental services are provided to approximately 5.5 million child Medi -Cal beneficiaries ages twenty (20) and under. Services are provided via two (2) delivery California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 68 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 systems - Fee-for-Service (FFS) and Dental Managed Care (DMC). The D epartment of Health Care Services (DHCS, Department) conducts oversight of the FFS contractor(s) and six (6) dental managed care contracts in the DMC system. DHCS facilitates access to oral health services for the FFS and DMC delivery systems in multiple ways, including through telephone service centers and correspondence controls for beneficiaries and providers; conducting beneficiary and provider outreach and education; implementing strategies for monitoring and augmenting provider network adequacy and beneficiary utilization; and providing regular reports to the Legislature, stakeholders, and federal and State government entities. All data and measurement reporting associated with the Dental Transformation Initiative (DTI) will be based on an annual re porting period by Program Year ( PY). The Medi -Cal Dental program aims to improve the beneficiary's experience so individuals can consistently and easily access high quality dental services supportive of achieving and maintaining good oral health; to imple ment effective, efficient, and sustainable health care delivery systems; to maintain effective, open communication, and engagement with our stakeholders; and to hold DHCS and our providers, plans, and partners accountable for performance and health outcome s. The Department employs performance measures in both delivery systems to gauge the effectiveness of contractor and State efforts. To aid in this performance monitoring, the Department utilizes a public Medi -Cal dental dashboard populated with performan ce measures posted on the Department's website, regular system reports, and ad hoc queries to the various databases. Benchmarks and quality and access criteria for the DMC and FFS delivery systems are designed to provide programmatic goals and expectation levels for contractors. Additionally, there are contractual checks targeted at ensuring access to care for the beneficiaries, encouraging provider participation, and holding the contractor(s) responsible for being active and proactive participants in ens uring the delivery of medically necessary dental services to the Medi -Cal beneficiary population. 105. DTI PROGRAM and FUNDING OVERVIEW The DTI will be funded at a maximum of $148 million annually, except as provided below, for five (5) years totaling a maximu m of $740 million (DTI Pool). To the extent any of the funds associated with the DTI are not fully expended in a given PY, those remaining prior PY funds may be available for DTI payments in subsequent years, notwithstanding the annual limits stated above . The program will include three (3) domains: preventive services, caries risk assessment and management, and continuity of care, in addition to making funding available for local pilots that address one (1) or more of these three (3) domains. Specific i ncentive payments within each domain will be furnished to qualified providers, along with messaging and education to providers and beneficiaries about programs and efforts in their local communities. The Department intends to allow DTI participation from providers in both the FFS and DMC delivery systems beginning in PY 1 and as outlined in these STCs. The Department will make DTI incentive payments directly to contracted service office locations that participate in the FFS and/or DMC delivery systems that qualify for DTI incentive payments. The service office location is the business or pay -to address where services are rendered by the provider (which may be an individual, partnership, group, association, corporation, institution, or entity that provides dental services). Incentive payments shall be issued to the servi ce office California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 69 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 location based on the services rendered at the location and compliance with the criteria enumerated in the STCs. Incentive payments from the DTI Pool are intended to support and reward participating service office locations for achievements wit hin one (1) or more of the project domains set forth herein. The incentive payments are not considered direct reimbursement for dental services under the State Plan. The non -federal share for DTI incentive payments shall be derived from expenditures asso ciated with those Designated State Health Programs set forth in STC 31 . 106. Domain 1: Increase Preventive Services Utilization for Children In alignment with the CMS Oral Health Initiative, this program aims to increase the statewide proportion of children ag es one (1) through twenty (20) enrolled in Medi -Cal who receive a preventive dental service in a given year. The Department's goal is to increase the utilization amongst children enrolled in the FFS and DMC dental delivery systems by at least ten (10) per centage points over a five (5) year period. The Department will commit to re-assessing the goal annually throughout the Demonstration period and increase said percentage, if appropriate, based on the success of the domain. For example, the 2014 rate for the state using the Form CMS -416 methodology was 37.84 percent of children. Thus, if this rate remained the same for the demonstration baseline year, the ten (10) percentage point improvement goal for this five (5) year demonstration would be to increase this rate to 47.84 percent of children statewide. DHCS will use the CMS 416 methodology for reporting purposes, but will pay out incentives using unrestricted eligibility criteria. DHCS will offer payments as financial incentives for dental service offic e locations to increase delivery of preventive oral care to Medi -Cal children, and to maintain preventive oral care for children who previously received that service. As of September 2015, there are 5,370 service office locations across California that pa rticipate in the Medi -Cal Dental Program. DHCS will stage a messaging campaign to explain the new incentive program to the provider community and to generate interest among beneficiaries. DHCS will leverage existing contract provisions specific to provid er and beneficiary outreach to operationalize the commitments of these STCs. a. Program Criteria . The incentive program will provide semi -annual incentive payments to dental provider service office locations that provide preventive services to an increased number of Medi -Cal children, as determined by the Department. Eligible providers will receive pa yments based on them achieving an increased number of Medi -Cal children who received eligible preventive dental services, as compared to a baseline pre -determined by the Department. Providers who render preventive services to a number of children that mee ts or exceeds a Department pre - determined number of beneficiaries, by county, would qualify for the incentive payment. Further, the program will also disburse incentive payments to providers who were not previously participating in Medi -Cal and rendering preventive services, but who do so during the demonstration, on the condition that they meet or exceed the provision of services based on the Department pre -determined number of beneficiaries, by county, needed to be served to achieve the goal. Safety net clinics California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 70 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 would also be eligible for these incentives and would be supplied with incentive payments separate and apart from their Prospective Payment System (PPS) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) rates for Federally Qualified Health Centers/Rural Health Cen ters and Tribal Health Centers, respectively. Each safety net clinic office location would be considered a dental service office location for purposes of this domain. The Department will determine the number of additional beneficiaries to be served in order to achieve the goal of ten (10) percentage point utilization increase statewide. That number will be distributed across counties based the county's proportional expected contribution to the statewide utilization increase. For example, if the number o f child Medi -Cal beneficiaries in County A account for thirty (30) percent of the statewide Medi -Cal children population, and 100 users are necessary to increase the statewide utilization by ten (10) percentage points, then County A service office location s will need to serve an additional thirty (30) beneficiaries. If County A needs to serve thirty (30) additional beneficiaries and there are ten (10) service office locations enrolled in the program, that goal of thirty (30) additional users would then be equitably distributed across the number of service office locations in the county; therefore, each service office location in County A would need to see three (3) additional users to qualify for the incentive payment. The same Departmental -established per service office location goal, by county, would apply to both current and newly enrolled providers. Each service office location will receive credit towards meeting or exceeding the Department pre -determined goal for every child to which they provide a preventive service within frequency limitations regardless of whether that child is a previously establ ished patient of that service office location. However, service office locations will only be paid incentive payments on preventive services provided to those beneficiaries they provide services to once they have met the Department established goal. b. Responsibilities of Providers Service office locations are expected to continue to follow claiming and billing guidelines of the Medi -Cal Dental Program and to adhere to requirements of this incentive program . c. Performance Metrics The Department will calculate a baseline measure of the rate of children's utilization of preventive services statewide and for each county, within the Medi -Cal FFS and DMC dental delivery systems, with a goal of increasing the statewide utilization of pre ventive services for children by at least ten (10) percentage points over five (5) years. The Department will also calculate the number of service locations that are providing preventive services to an increased number of children. The baseline year will consist of data from the most recent complete year preceding implementation of the waiver. Beneficiary utilization and service office location participation will be reassessed on an annual basis thereafter. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 71 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The first metric that will be used for monitor ing domain success is the percentage of beneficiaries who received any preventive dental service during the measurement period, which is calculated as follows: i. Numerator: Number of unduplicated children ages one (1) through twenty (20) enrolled in Medi -Cal for at least ninety (90) continuous days who received any Medi -Cal covered preventive dental service (D1000 -D1999) in the measurement period. ii. Denominator: Number of unduplicated children ages one (1) through twenty (20) enrolled in Medi -Cal for at least ninety (90) continuous days during the measurement period. iii. The second metric that will be used is claims data to determine the number of service office locations in each county that are providing preventive dental services to children, compared to the numb er of these locations in the baseline year. iv. A third metric will track statewide the number and percentage change of Medicaid participating dentists providing preventive dental services to at least ten (10) Medicaid -enrolled children in the baseline year, a nd in each subsequent measurement year. d. State Oversight, Monitoring, and Reporting i. Program Integrity: To ensure program integrity, the Department will perform annual assessments of service utilization, billing patterns and shifts in enrollment for anomali es that may be indicators of fraud, waste or abuse. The Department is required to ensure that all claims submitted for adjudication are handled in a timely manner. Any suspicious claim activity is tracked through the program's Surveillance Utilization Re view System (SURS) to prevent fraud and abuse. ii. Monitoring Plan/Provisions: To measure the impact on the utilization of preventive services, there will be monitoring of actively participating service office locations and monitoring of preventive services ut ilization statewide and by county via claims utilization. iii. Reporting of Activity: The Department will be responsible for reporting on data and quality measures to CMS on an annual basis in the demonstration annual report. A preliminary report will be del ivered only to CMS for internal review six (6) months following the end of the applicable PY. An updated report will be delivered to CMS and published publicly twelve (12) months following the end of the applicable PY. Content will include, but not be limited to: i. A detailed description of how DHCS has operationalized this domain, including information about which entities (DHCS, MCOs, dental vendor, others) have responsibility for the components of this domain; ii. The number of individual incentives paid, and the total amount expended, under this domain in the current PY; iii. A plan (awareness plan) that describes (a) how the Department has generated awareness of the availability of incentives for providing California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 72 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 preventive dental services to children, including steps taken to increase awareness of the DTI among dental as well as primary care providers, and (b) how the Department has generated awareness among enrollees of the availability of, the importance of, and how to access preventive dental services for chil dren. Specific approaches will break out for example, age groupings, rural and urban residents, or primary language and should be developed in conjunction with interested dental and children's health stakeholders. iv. An annual analysis of whether the awarene ss plan has succeeded in generating the necessary utilization, by subgrouping, to meet the goals of this domain, and a description of changes to the awareness plan to address any identified deficiencies; v. Data describing the use of preventive dental service s and, separately, other dental services, and expenditures on preventive dental services and, separately, other dental services; vi. A discussion of the extent to which the metrics described for this domain are proving to be useful in understanding the effecti veness of the activities undertaken in the domain; vii. An analysis of changes in cost per capita; viii. A descriptive analysis of a ny program integrity challenges generated by this domain and how those ch allenges have been, or will be, addressed; and ix. A descriptive analysis of the overall effectiveness of the activities in this domain in meeting the intended goals, any lessons learned, and any adjustments recommended. e. Incentives DHCS may earn additional demonstration authority, up to a maximum of $10 million, to be added to the DTI Pool for use in paying incentives to qualifying providers under DTI, by achieving higher performance improvement, as indicated in the below table: PY Target $1 million in additional demonstration authority for achieving: $2 million in additional demonstration authority for achieving: 1 + two (2) percentage points over baseline year Not Applicable + three (3) or more percentage points over baseline year 2 + four (4) percentage points over baseline year +5 or more percentage points over the baseline + six (6) or more percentage points over baseline year 3 + six (6) percentage points over +7.5 or more percentage points over the baseline + nine (9) or more percentage points over baseline year California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 73 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 baseline year 4 + eight (8) percentage points over baseline year +10 or more percentage points over the baseline + twelve (12) or more percentage points over baseline year 5 + ten (10) percentage points over baseline year +12.5 or more percentage points over the baseline + fifteen (15) or more percentage points over baseline year f. Financing The incentive payment for preventive services will equate to a payment of approximately seventy -five (75) percent above the Schedule of Maximum Allowances (SMA) for all preventive services provided to the c hildren above the Department pre -determined threshold for the number of beneficiaries served, subject to the annual funding limits contained herein and any annual limit applicable to this specific domain. The incentive funding available for payments withi n this domain will not exceed the amount apportioned from the DTI pool to this domain for the applicable PY, except as provided for in STC 105 . g. Evaluation The results of this project will be used to determine if provider incentive payments are an effectiv e method by which to encourage service office locations to provide preventive dental services to more Medi -Cal children and to what extent an incentive payment is an effective method for increasing Medi -Cal provider participation which could then impact be tter access to care for children. 107. Domain 2: Caries Risk Assessment and Disease Management Pilot This four (4) year domain will only be available initially to dentists in pilot counties that elect and are approved by the Department to participate in the program. The Department will begin this effort as a pilot in select counties and will then seek to implement on a statewide basis if the pilot is determined to be successful and subject to the availability of funding under the DTI Pool. If successful, DHCS will consider expansion no sooner than nine (9) months following the end of PY 2. Through this effort, Medi -Cal dentists voluntarily participating in the domain will be eligible to receive incentive payments for performing pre-identified treatment plans for children based upon the beneficiary's risk level as determined by the dentist via a caries ri sk assessment (CRA) which will include motivational interviewing and use of antimicrobials, as indicated . The pre -identified treatment plans will be generated by the Department, and will correspond to the varying degrees of caries risk \u2014 low, moderate, an d high. Pilot counties will be identified and selected by the Department through an analysis of counties with a high percentage of restorative services, a low percentage of preventive services, and indication of likely participation by enrolled service of fice locations. Dentists must first complete a CRA to determine the appropriate treatment plan for a child, and report the results of the CRA to DHCS on a claim. Once the risk level and the treatment plan have been determined, the beneficiary may be elig ible for increased frequency limitations on prophylaxis, topical fluoride varnish, and exams. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 74 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The key elements of this model are to formally assess and manage caries risk, and to emphasize the provision of preventive services in lieu of more invasive and costly procedures. a. Program Criteria The incentive program will only be available for services performed on child beneficiary's age six (6) and under. The pre -identified treatment plans will be composed of the following procedures: CRA (which will glo bally include support for behavior change through motivational interviewing and nutritional counseling, and for disease management through use of antimicrobials,), application of topical fluoride varnish, toothbrush prophylaxis, and exams will be permitted for children evaluated and determined to be a particular caries risk level with frequency limitations in a twelve (12) month period, as follows: \"high risk\" children will be authorized to visit their provider four (4) times; \"moderate risk\" children will be authorized to visit three (3) times; and \"low risk\" children two (2) times. Dentists will receive payment for completion of a CRA and the corresponding treatment plan within the designated time frame. b. Responsibilities of Providers Dentists participat ing in the domain must opt -in by completing a no -cost Department recognized training program (which could be developed in partnership with California Dental Association, as an example) and submitting verification documentation. Authorized training program s and acceptable documentation will be posted on the Medi -Cal Dental website. The Department will have an annual \"open enrollment\" for the domain in pilot counties and in additional counties when and if this domain is expanded beyond the pilot counties. c. Performance Metrics The following procedures will be incorporated in the Department -determined treatment plans for child beneficiaries: CRA (which will globally include behavior modification through motivational interviewing and nutritional counseling, as well as antimicrobials), application of topical fluoride varnish, toothbrush prophylaxis, and exams. Increased frequencies for toothbrush prophylaxis, fluoride varnish, and exams will be permitted for children evaluated and determined to be at a particul ar caries risk level with frequency limitations in a twelve (12) month period, as follows: \"high risk\" will be authorized to visit their provider four (4) times; \"moderate risk\" children will be authorized to visit three (3) times; and \"low risk\" children two (2) times. The baseline year will consist of collecting data statewide for the most recent state fiscal year preceding implementation of the domain. The Department will collect data and report on the following performance measures, broken down by age ranges under one (1), one (1) through two (2), three (3) through four (4), and five (5) through six (6) : i. Number of, and percentage change in, restorative services; ii. Number of, and percentage change in, preventive dental services; iii. Utilization of CRA CDT codes and reduction of caries risk levels (not California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 75 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 available in the baseline year prior to the Waiver implementation); iv. Change in use of emergency rooms for dental related reasons among the targeted children for this domain (use of the E R for dental trauma will be excluded from this analysis if a claims -based methodology for doing so is identified); and v. Change in number and proportion of children receiving dental surgery under general anesthesia. The Department will also track and report on, for children in age ranges under one (1), one (1) through two (2), three (3) through four (4), and five (5) through six (6), the utilization rates for restorative procedures against preventive services to determine if the domain has been effective in reducing the number of restorations being performed. Because preventive services do not yield immediate effects, the Department will be required to collect data on these performance measures at annual intervals for a number of years to determine correlati on and statistical significance. The Department will inform CMS of the number of additional years this data will be collected and reported no later than the end of PY 1. The Department will also track and report on the utilization of CRA and treatment plan service to monitor utilization and domain participation. d. State Oversight, Monitoring, and Reporting i. Program Integrity: To ensure program integrity, the Department wil l perform annual assessments of service utilization, billing patterns and shifts in enrollment for anomalies that may be indicators of fraud, waste or abuse. The Department is required to ensure all claims submitted for adjudication are handled in a timel y manner. Any suspicious claim activity is tracked through the program's SURS to prevent fraud and abuse. ii. Monitoring Plan/Provisions: To measure the impact on the utilization of CRA and management of childhood caries, there will be quarterly monitoring of actively participating service office locations and monitoring of CRA and treatment plans in each participating county. iii. Reporting of Activity: The Department will be responsible for reporting on data and quality measures to CMS on an annual basis in the demonstration annual report. A preliminary report will be delivered only to CMS for internal review six (6) months following the end of the applicable PY. An updated report will be delivered to CMS and published publicly twelve (12) months following the end of the applicable PY. Content will include, but not be limited to: A.

Financing Dentists participating in the domain will be authorized to perform an increased number of services per year in accordance with the pre -identified treatment plan options based upon caries risk level, and are eligible to receive an incentive payment under this program for each additional service not currently covered under the California State Plan and frequency limitations listed in the Manual of Criteria. Subject to the annual funding limits contained herein and any annual limit applicable to this specific domain, qualifying service office locatio ns will receive an incentive payment for providing each of these additional services. The incentive funding available for payments within this domain will not exceed the amount apportioned from the DTI pool to this domain for the applicable PY, except as provided for in STC 105. f. Evaluation The results of this project will be used to determine if this provider incentive program is effective in encouraging providers to perform a CRA for the targeted population and to ensure completion of the appropriate tre atment plan for the management of childhood caries, if the utilization of emergency room visits for dental issues among the targeted children declines, if expenditures of emergency room visits non-traumatic dental issues among targeted children declines, a nd if the utilization of and expenditures (including anesthesia and facility fees) for the targeted children receiving dental related general anesthesia declines. 108. Domain 3: Increase Continuity of Care To encourage the continuity of care within the beneficiary population, an incentive payment California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 77 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 would be paid to service office locations who have maintained continuity of care through providing examinations for their enrolled child beneficiaries, age twenty ( 20) and under over the course of this Waiver. The Department will begin this effort as a pilot in select counties and will then seek to implement on a statewide basis if the pilot is determined to be successful and subject to the availability of funding u nder the DTI Pool. If successful, DHCS will consider expansion no sooner than nine (9) months following the end of PY 2. a. Program Criteria This incentive program will be available to service office locations that provide examinations (D0120, D0150, or D0145) to an enrolled Medi -Cal child for two (2), three (3), four (4), five (5), and six (6) year continuous periods. The incentive will be a flat payment for providing continuity of care to the beneficiary. Incentive payments will be made annually. b. Responsibilities of Provider s Service office locations are expected to continue to follow claim and billing guidelines of the Medi -Cal Dental Program and to adhere to requirements of this incentive program. c. Performance Metrics The baseline year will be based on data from the most recent complete state fiscal year. Using claims data, DHCS will determine the number of beneficiaries who have remained with their same service office location for two ( 2), three (3), four (4), five (5), and six (6) year continuous periods following the establishment of the baseline year throughout the demonstration period. The metric described above is calculated as follows: i. Numerator: Number of children age twenty (20) and under who received an examination from the same service of fice location with no gap in service for two (2), three (3), four (4), five (5), and six (6) year continuous periods from the baseline . ii. Denominator: Number of children age twenty (20) and under enrolled in the delivery system during the measurement periods. iii. This measure is similar to the Dental Quality Alliance measure Usual Source of Services, with the exception that the Department would incent over a longer continuous period. d. State Oversight, Monitoring, and Reporting i. Program Integrity: To ensur e program integrity, the Department will perform annual assessments of service utilization, billing patterns, and shifts in enrollment for anomalies that may be indicators of fraud, waste or abuse. The Department is required to ensure all claims submitted for adjudication are handled in a timely manner. Any suspicious claim activity is tracked through the program's SURS to prevent fraud and abuse. ii. Monitoring Plan/Provisions: To measure the impact on the continuity of care, there will be annual monitoring of the performance measure, usual source of care by service office location. iii. Reporting of Activity: The Department will be responsible for reporti ng on data and quality measures to CMS on an annual basis in the demonstration annual report. A preliminary report will be delivered only to CMS for internal review six California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 78 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 (6) months following the end of the applicable PY. An updated report will be delivere d to CMS and published publicly twelve (12) months following the end of the applicable DY. Content will include, but not be limited to: A. A detailed description of how DHCS has operationalized this domain, including information about which entities (DHCS, M COs, dental vendor, others) have responsibility for the components of this domain; B. The number of individual incentives paid and the total amount expended under this domain, by county, in the current DY; C. A descriptive assessment of the impact of this domain on provision of the following to targeted children 1. Dental exams; 2. Use of and expenditures on preventive dental services; and 3. Use of and expenditures on other dental services. D. A discussion of the extent to which the metrics described for this domain are pr oving to be useful in understanding the effectiveness of the activities undertaken in the domain; E. An analysis of change in cost per capita; F. A descriptive analysis of any program integrity challenges generated by this domain and how those challenges have b een, or will be, addressed; and G. A descriptive analysis of the overall effectiveness of the activities in this domain in meeting the intended goals, any lessons learned, and any adjustments recommended. e. Financing Subject to the annual funding limits conta ined herein and any annual limit applicable to this specific domain, incentive payment amounts will be made available in tiers based on the length of time a beneficiary maintains continuity of care with the same service office location. Tier one (1) payme nts will be provided on a per -child basis for beneficiaries who receive at least two (2) examinations from the same service office location for two (2) consecutive years. In each subsequent year, the dollar amount of the incentive payment for an exam of t he same child within that period would be increased. The incentive funding available for payments within this domain will not exceed the amount apportioned from the DTI pool to this domain for the applicable PY, except as provided for in STC 105. f. Evaluation The results of this project will be used to determine if incentive payments are effective in promoting continuity of care for the targeted children under this domain. 109. Local Dental Pilot Program Local dental pilot projects (LDPPs) will address one (1) or more of the three (3) domains through alternative programs, potentially using strategies focused on rural areas including local case management initiatives and education partnerships. DHCS will r equire local pilots to have broad -based provider and community support and collaboration including Tribes and Indian health programs, with incentives related to goals and metrics that contribute to the overall goals of the Department in any of the domains specified above.

The incentive funding available for payments will not exceed the amount apportioned from the DTI pool to this domain for the applicable PY, except as provided for in STC 105 . f. Evaluation Local dental pilot projects will be evaluated consistent with the performance metrics of the aforementioned dental domains and the goals outlined in the individual proposals. DHCS reserves the right to suspend or terminate a pilot at any time if the enumera ted goals are not met. 110. Whole Person Care Pilots. The overarching goal of the Whole Person Care (WPC) Pilots is the coordination of health, behavioral health, and social services, as applicable, in a patient - centered manner with the goals of improved beneficiary health and wellbeing through more efficient and effective use of resources. WPC Pilots will pro vide an option to a county, a city and county, a health or hospital authority, or a consortium of any of the above entities serving a county or region consisting of more than one county, or a health authority, to receive support to integrate care for a par ticularly vulnerable group of Medi -Cal beneficiaries who have been identified as high users of multiple systems and continue to have poor health outcomes . Through collaborative leadership and systematic coordination among public and private entities, WPC P ilot entities will identify target populations, share data between systems, coordinate care real time, and evaluate individual and population progress - all with the goal of providing comprehensive coordinated care for the beneficiary resulting in better h ealth outcomes. The investment in this localized effort will build and strengthen relationships, and improve collaboration among participating WPC Pilot entities. The results of these WPC Pilots will also provide learnings for potential future local eff orts beyond the term of this waiver. The specific strategies, target populations, payment methodologies, and California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 81 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 participating entities shall be established by the entity submitting the application in consultation with participating entities. Each WPC Pilot is intended to be in operation from the date of approval through the end of the demonstration. Additional funds for existing WPC Pilots or new WPC Pilots may be approved by the state after the initial application period if additional funds are available. D HCS will issue guidance to WPC Pilot Lead Entities in the form of guidance and policy letters to implement the Pilot program and structure, as needed. 111. Whole Person Care Pilot Programs Target Population(s). WPC Pilots shall identify high-risk, high -utiliz ing Medi -Cal beneficiaries in the geographic area that they serve and assess their unmet need. WPC Pilots must define their target populations and interventions to provide integrated services to high users of multiple systems. The target population shall be identified through a collaborative data approach to identify common patients who frequently access urgent and emergent services often times across multiple systems. Target populations may include but are not limited to individuals: a. with repeated incidents of avoidable emergency use, hospital admissions, or nursing facility placement; b. with two or more chronic conditions; c. with mental health and/or substance use disorders; d. who are currently experiencing homelessness; and/or e. individuals who are a t risk of homelessness, including individuals who will experience homelessness upon release from institutions (hospital, sub -acute care facility, skilled nursing facility, rehabilitation facility, IMD, county jail, state prisons, or other) Individuals who are not Medi -Cal beneficiaries may participate in approved WPC Pilots, but funding in support of services provided to such individuals is not eligible for Federal financial participation. These individuals shall only be included in the Pilo t at the discretion of the WPC Pilot and as approved during the application process. The non - Federal funds expended providing services to individuals who are not Medi -Cal beneficiaries may exceed the funding limits described in STCs 132 and 133. 112. WPC Strat egies. WPC Pilots shall include specific strategies to: a. Increase integration among county agencies, health plans, and providers, and other entities within the participating county or counties that serve high -risk, high -utilizing beneficiaries and develop a n infrastructure that will ensure local collaboration among the entities participating in the WPC Pilots over the long term; b. Increase coordination and appropriate access to care for the most vulnerable Medi -Cal beneficiaries; c. Reduce inappropriate emergen cy and inpatient utilization; d. Improve data collection and sharing amongst local entities to support ongoing case management, monitoring, and strategic program improvements in a sustainable fashion; e. Achieve targeted quality and administrative improvement be nchmarks; f. Increase access to housing and supportive services (optional); and g. Improve health outcomes for the WPC population. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 82 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 113. Whole Person Care Pilot Payments . Subject to the funding limits in STCs 13 2 and 13 3, DHCS shall review, approve, and make payments for WPC Pilots in accordance with the requirements in this STC . WPC Pilot payments shall be paid in accordance with STCs 13 2 and 13 3. WPC Pilot payments shall support 1) infrastructure to integrate services a mong local entities that serve the target population; 2) services not otherwise covered or directly reimbursed by Medi -Cal to improve care for the target population such as housing components; and 3) other strategies to improve integration, reduce unnecess ary utilization of health care services, and improve health outcomes. 114. Housing and Supportive Services . WPC Pilots may target the focus of their Pilot on individuals at risk of or are experiencing homelessness who have a demonstrated medical need for housing or supportive services. In these instances, WPC Pilots would include local housing authorities, local Continuum of Care (CoCs) programs, community based organizations, and others serving the homeless population as entities collaborating and partici pating in the WPC Pilot. Housing interventions may include: a. Tenancy -based care management services . Tenancy -based care management supports to assist the target population in locating and maintaining medically necessary housing. These services may include individual housing transition services, such as individual outreach and assessments; individual hou sing and tenancy sustaining services, such as tenant and landlord education and tenant coaching; and housing - related collaborative activities, such as services that support collaborative efforts across public agencies and the private sector that assist WPC entities in identifying and securing housing for the target population. b. County Housing Pools . WPC Pilot entities may include contributions to a county - wide housing pool (Housing Pool) that will directly provide needed support for medically necessary hou sing services, with the goal of improving access to housing and reducing churn in the Medicaid population. The Housing Pool may be funded through WPC Pilot funds or direct contributions from community entities. These services may include those identified i n the June 26, 2015 CMCS Informational Bullentin, \"Coverage of Housing -Related Activities and Services for Indivuduals with Disabilities\". State or local government and community entity contributions to the Housing Pool are separate from Federal financial p articipation funds, and may be allocated to fund support for long -term housing, including rental housing subsidies. The Housing Pool may leverage local resources to increase access to subsidized housing units. The Housing Pool may also incorporate a financ ing component to reallocate or reinvest a portion of the savings from the reduced utilization of health care services into the Housing Pool. As applicable to an approved WPC Pilot, WPC investments in housing units or housing subsidies including any paymen t for room and board are not eligible for Federal financial participation . Room and board would not include those housing -related activities or services recognized as reimbursable under CMS policy. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 83 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 115. Lead and Participating Entities . DHCS will accept appli cations for WPC Pilots from a county, a city and county, a health or hospital authority, or a consortium of any of the above entities serving a county or region consisting of more than one county. Each WPC Pilot application shall designate a \"Lead Entity\" that will be either a county agency, designated public hospita l as identified in Attachment D or district municipal public hospit al as identified in Attachment D that will coordinate the WPC Pilot and be the single point of contact for DHCS. The WPC P ilot application shall identify other entities that shall participate in the WPC Pilot. Participating entities must include a minimum of one Medi -Cal managed care health plan (MCP) operating in the geographic area of the WPC Pilot to work in partnership w ith the Lead Entity when implementing the Pilot specific to Medi -Cal managed care beneficiaries. Participating entities shall also include both the health services and specialty mental health agencies or department, and at least one other public agency or department s, which may include county alcohol and substance use disorder programs, human services agencies, public health departments, criminal justice/probation entities, and housing authorities (regardless of how many of these fall under the same agency head within a county.) WPC Pilots must also include at least two other key community partners that have significant experience serving the target population within the participating county or counties geographic area such as physician groups, clinics, hospitals, and community -based organizations. If a Lead Entity cannot reach agreement with a required participant, it may request an exception to the requirement. 116. Whole Person Care Pilot Beneficiary Participation. Receipt of WPC Pilot services is voluntary and eligible beneficiaries must opt -in to the Pilot; they may also opt out at any time. Lead Entities may identify an enrollment cap for the Pilot during the application approval process. A Lead Entity must notify the State within 90 days prior to imposing an enrollment cap and obtain approval to do so. Lead Entities must develop wait lists when a cap is imposed. 117.

The WPC Pilot payments shall be contingent on timely submission of the mid -year and annual reports. 122. Universal and Variant Metrics . DHCS will categorize Pilots, as appropriate, and will create a list of category -specific performance metrics that the WPC Pilot entities in each category must report mid -year and annually, with reporting to start no later than one year following Pilot implementation after completion of any start -up period. Metrics may be reported partially during the initial implementation period due to data lags. These metrics will allow DHCS to measure progress consistently across Pilots, and allow flexibility for reflecting the variety of strategies. These will be sent to CMS for approval before Pilot applications are accepted. WPC Pilots will report on additiona l metrics which may vary between Pilots. These metrics will be approved through the application process and will be specific to the structure of the Pilot and target population. Metrics wi ll be described in Attachment GG . 123. Mid-Point and Final Evaluations. Comprehensive mid -point and final evaluations will be conducted for WPC Pilot si tes as described in Attachment GG . The mid -point evaluation will be due to DHCS one year prior to the expiration of the Demonstration, and the final evaluation will be due to D HCS no later than six months following the expiration of the Demonstration. The purpose of the evaluations will be to understand the extent to which the WPC Pilot interventions: a. Improve coordination across participating entities including data and informat ion sharing; b. Improve beneficiary health outcomes; c. Reduce avoidable utilization of emergency and inpatient services (ED, hospital and psychiatric inpatient); d. Increase access to social services; e. Improve care coordination across participating entities; f. Impro ve housing stability, if applicable; 124. WPC Pilot Protocols. a. Within 60 days of CMS approval of the terms and conditions for Medi -Cal 2020, CMS and the State will, through a collaborative process, develop and finalize WPC Pilot California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 87 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Requirements and Metrics, WPC Pilot Requirements and Application Process, and WPC Reporting and Evaluation.

After the state has received a Pilot application, but prior to the state's app roval of any proposal, the state will submit to CMS its proposed list of Variant Metrics. CMS reserves the right to propose additional metrics. The Universal and Variant Metrics approved by CMS (including measure specifications) will be incorporated into a revised WPC Reporti ng and Evaluation (Attachment GG ). The state may not approve any application prior to CMS appro val of the revised Attachment GG . 125. WPC Pilot Payment Structure For purposes of the WPC Pilots, the WPC Pilot year shall begin on January 1 and end on December 31. Beginning in PY1 until the end of the Demonstration, up to $300 million in Federal financial participation shall be made available to fund the WPC Pilots as described in the WPC Pilot Special Term s and Conditions and Attachment HH . 126. WPC Pilot Payments Payments from the WPC Pool are available to approved Lead Entities. Funding from the WPC Pool (total computable) shall not exceed $3 billion in the aggregate over five years. a. Each WPC Lead Entity or other entities as specified in the approved WPC Pilot application will provide the non -federal share of payment through an intergovernmental transfer (IGT). The funding entity shall certify that the funds transferred qualify for federal financial participation pursuant to 42 C.F.R. part 433 subpart B, and are not derived from impermissible sources such as recycled Medicaid payments, fede ral money excluded from use as s tate match, impermissible taxes, and non-bona fide provider -related donations. The s tate must have permissible sources for the non -federal shar e of WPC expenditures, which may include permissible IGTs from government -operated entities and state funds. Sources of non -federal funding shall not include provider taxes or donations impermissible under section 1903(w), impermissible intergovernmental transfers from providers, or federal funds received from federal programs other than Medicaid (unless expressl y authorized by federal statute to be used for claiming purposes, and the federal Medicaid funding is credited to the other federal funding source). For this purpose, federal funds do not include PRIME p ayments, patient care revenue received as payment for services rendered under programs such as the Designat ed State Health Programs, Medicare, or Medicaid. b. Funding for PY1 shall be made available to approved applications.

(General Overview of Payments) , in the event that the number of approved WPC Pilots results in unallocated funding for a given Demonstration year, participating Lead Entities may submit applications to the state in a manner and timeline specified by DHCS proposing that the remaining funds be ca rried forward into the following PY, or to expand Pilot services or enrollment for which such unallocated funding will be made available. Additional applicants not approved during the initial application process may also submit an application for considera tion. e. If a selected applicant fails to substantially comply with any of the terms of the approved application, DHCS may terminate the contract and redirect remaining funds to other selected applicants or to other applicants whose programs were not previou sly selected for funding. f. Payments for WPC Pilots are based on the approved WPC amounts and will be contingent upon specific deliverables, e.g., encounters or persons served, the performance of specific activities, interventions, supports and services, or achievement of Pilot outcomes, as described in the approved WPC application. WPC Pilot Lead Entities will be accountable to DHCS and CMS to demonstrate that WPC Pilot funds were received for the interventions and in the manner agreed upon. The annual progr ess reports must document how the Lead Entity satisfied the requirements for receiving funding for each component as described in the application. If the Lead Entity cannot demonstrate completion of a deliverable or outcome as described in the application DHCS shall withhold or recoup the WPC funds linked to that deliverable. g. WPC Pilot Payments Are Not Direct Reimbursement for Expenditures or Payments for Services. Payments from the WPC Pool are intended to support WPC Pilots for infrastructure and non -Medicaid covered interventions that support increased integration among county agencies, health plans, and providers, and other entities within the participating county or counties, increased coordination and appropriate access to care for the most vulnerabl e, and improved data collection and sharing among local entities to support ongoing case management, monitoring, and strategic program improvements. The payments are not direct reimbursement for expenditures incurred by participating entities in implement ing reforms. WPC Pilot payments are not for services otherwise reimbursable under the Medi -Cal program, and therefore providers may continue to bill Medi -Cal and/or the Medi -Cal managed care plan for all State Plan covered services. The WPC Pilot payments are not reimbursement for health care services that are recognized under these Special Terms and Conditions or under the State plan. WPC Pilot payments should not be considered patient care revenue and should not be offset against the certified public exp enditures incurred by government -operated health care systems and their affiliated government entity providers for health care services, disproportionate share hospital payments or administrative activities as defined under these Special Terms and Conditio ns and/or under the State plan. The payments do not offset payment amounts otherwise payable to and by MCPs for Medi -Cal beneficiaries, or suppl ant provider payments from MCPs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 89 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 X. DRUG MEDI -CAL ORGANIZED DELIVERY SYSTEM 127. Drug Medi -Cal Eligibility and Delivery System. The \"Drug Medi -Cal Organized Delivery System (DMC -ODS)\" is a Pilot program to test a new paradigm for the organized delivery of health care services for Medicaid eligible individuals with substance use disorde r (SUD). The DMC -ODS will demonstrate how organized substance use disorder care increases the success of DMC beneficiaries while decreasing other system health care costs. Critical elements of the DMC -ODS Pilot include providing a continuum of care modeled after the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) Criteria for substance use disorder treatment services, increased local control and accountability, greater administrative oversight, creates utilization controls to improve care and efficient use of resources, evidence based practices in substance abuse treatment, and increased coordination with other systems of care. This approach is expected to provide the beneficiary with access to the care and system interaction needed in order to achieve sustainable recovery. 128. Drug Medi -Cal Definitions a. Delivery System The DMC -Organized Delivery System is a Medi -Cal benefit in counties that choose to opt into and implement the Pilot program. Any county that elects to opt into DMC -ODS services shall submit an implementation plan to the State for approval by DHCS and CMS pursuant to Attachment Z. Upon approval of the implementation plan, the State shall enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the County to provide or arrange for the provision of DMC -ODS services through a Prepaid Inpatient Hospital Plan (PIHP) as d efined in 42 CFR 438.2DMC -ODS shall be available as a Medi -Cal benefit for individuals who meet the medical necessity criteria and reside in a county that opts into the Pilot program. Upon approval of an implementation plan, the State will enter into an intergovernmental agreement with the county to provide DMC -ODS services. The county will, in turn, contract with DMC certified providers or offer county - operated services to provide all services outlined in the DMC -ODS. Counties may also contract with a man aged care plan to provide services. Participating counties with the approval from the State may develop regional delivery systems for one or more of the required modalities or request flexibility in delivery system design. Counties may act jointly in order to deliver these services. b. Short -Term Resident Any beneficiary receiving residential services pursuant to DMC -ODS, regardless of the length of stay, is a \"short -term resident\" of the residential facility in which they are receiving the services. c. Tribal and Indian Health Providers A description of how the Tribal operated and urban Indian health providers, as well as American Indians and Alaska Natives Medi -Cal beneficiaries, will participate in the program through a Tribal Delivery System will be outlined in Attachment BB following approval of this amendment. The provisions in Attachment BB will be consistent with the authorities in the Indian Health Care Improvement Act (including the statutory exemption from state California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 90 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 or local licensure or recognition requir ements at Section 1621(t) of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act) and will be developed in consultation with the California tribes, and Tribal and Urban Indian health programs located in the state, consistent with the Tribal Consultation SPA and the CMS Tribal Consultation Policy. d. DMC -ODS Program Medical Criteria In order to receive services through the DMC -ODS, the beneficiary must be enrolled in Medi -Cal, reside in a participating county and meet the following medical necessity criteria: i. Must have one diagnosis from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) for Substance -Related and Addictive Disorders with the exception of Tobacco -Related Disorders and Non-Substance - Related Disorders; or be assessed to be at risk for developi ng substance use disorder (for youth under 21). ii. Must meet the ASAM Criteria definition of medical necessity for services based on the ASAM Criteria. iii. If applicable, must meet the ASAM adolescent treatment criteria. As a point of clarification, beneficiaries under age 21 are eligible to receive Medicaid services pursuant to the Early Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT) mandate. Under the EPSDT mandate, beneficiaries under age 21 are eligible to receive all appropriate and medically necessary services needed to correct and ameliorate health conditions that are coverable under section 1905(a) Medicaid authority. Nothing in the DMC -ODS Pilot overrides any EPSDT requirements. e. DMC -ODS Determination of Medicaid Eligibility Determination of who may receive the DMC -ODS benefit will be performed as follows: i. Medicaid eligibility must be verified by the county or county contracted provider. When the county contracted provider conducts the initial eligibility verification, it will be reviewed and approved by the county prior to payment for services, unless the individual is eligible to receive services from tribal health programs operating under the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (ISDEAA - Pub.L. 93-638, as amended) and urban Indian organizations operating under title V of the IHCIA. If so eligible, the determination will be conducted as set forth in the Tribal Delivery System - Attachment BB to these STCs. ii. The initial medical necessity determination for the DMC -ODS benefit must be performed through a face -to-face review or telehealth by a Medical Director, licensed physician, or Licensed Practitioner of the Healing Arts (LPHA) as defined in Section 3(a). After establishing a diagnosis, the ASAM Criteria will be applied to determine p lacement into the level of assessed services. iii. Medical necessity qualification for ongoing receipt of DMC -ODS is determined at least every six months through the reauthorization California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 91 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 process for individuals determined by the Medical Director, licensed physician or LPHA to be clinically appropriate; except for NTP services which will require reauthorization annually. f. Grievances and Appeals Each County shall have an internal grievance process that allows a beneficiary, or provider on behalf of the beneficiary, to challenge a denial of coverage of services or denial of payment for services by a participating County. The Department of Health Care Services will provide beneficiaries access to a state fair hearing process. i. The grievance and appeals process for the Trib al Delivery System will be outlined in Attachment BB. 129. DMC -ODS Benefit and Individual Treatment Plan (ITP) Standard DMC services approved through the State Plan Benefit will be available to all beneficiaries in all counties. a. Beneficiaries that reside in a Pilot County will receive DMC -ODS benefits in addition to other state plan services. County eligibility w ill be based on the MEDs file. b. In counties that do not opt into the Pilot, beneficiaries receive only those drug and substance use disorder treatment services outlined in the approved state plan (including EPSDT). c. Beneficiaries receiving services in counties which do not opt into the Pilot will not have access to the services outlined in the DMC -ODS. d. The benefits and ITP for the Tribal Delivery Syste m will be discussed in Attachment BB.

Counties will also coordinate a system of case management services with physical and/or mental health in order to ensure appropriate level California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 103 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 of care. b. Case management services are defined as a service that assist a beneficiary to access needed medical, educational, social, prevocational, vocational, rehabilitative, or other community services. These services focus on coordination of SUD care, integration around primary care especially for beneficiaries with a chronic substance use disorder, and interaction with the criminal justice system, if needed. c. Case managemen t services may be provided face -to-face, by telephone, or by telehealth with the beneficiary and may be provided anywhere in the community. d. Case management services include: i. Comprehensive assessment and periodic reassessment of individual needs to determin e the need for continuation of case management services; ii. Transition to a higher or lower level SUD of care; iii. Development and periodic revision of a client plan that includes service activities; iv. Communication, coordination, referral and related activities; v. Monitoring service delivery to ensure beneficiary access to service and the service delivery system; vi. Monitoring the beneficiary's progress; vii. Patient advocacy, linkages to physical and mental health care, transportation and retention in primary care services ; and, viii. Case management shall be consistent with and shall not violate confidentiality of alcohol or drug patients as set forth in 42 CFR Part 2, and California law. 140. Physician Consultation Services include DMC physicians' consulting with addiction medicine physicians, addiction psychiatrists or clinical pharmacists. Physician consultation services are not with DMC -ODS beneficiaries; rather, they are designed to assist DMC physicians with seeking expert advice on designing treatment plans for specific DMC -ODS beneficiaries. a. Physician consultation services are to support DMC providers with complex cases which may address medication selection, dosing, side effect management, adherence, drug -drug interactions, or level of care considerations. b. Counties may contract with one or more physicians or pharmacists in order to provide consultation services. Physician consultation services can only be billed by and reimbursed to DMC providers. 141. Intersection with the Criminal Justice System: Beneficiaries involved in the c riminal justice system often are harder to treat for SUD. While research has shown that the criminal justice population can respond effectively to treatment services, the beneficiary may require more intensive services. Additional services for this population may include: a. Eligibility: Counties recognize and educate staff and collaborative partners that Parole and Probation status is not a barrier to expanded Medi -Cal substance use disorder treatment services if the parolees and probationers are eligible. Currently incarcerated inmates are not eligible to receive FFP for DMC -ODS California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 104 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 services. b. Lengths of Stay: Counties may provide extended lengths of stay for withdrawal and residential services for criminal justice offenders if assessed for need (e.g. up to 6 months residential; 3 months FFP with a one -time 30 -day extension if found to be medically necessary and if longer lengths are needed, other county identified funds can be used). c. Promising Practices: Counties utilize promising practices such as Dru g Court services. 142. DMC -ODS Provider Specifications The following requirements will apply to DMC -ODS staff: a. Professional staff must be licensed, registered, certified, or recognized under California State scope of practice statutes. Professional staff shall provide services within their individual scope of practice and receive supervision required under their scope of practice laws. Licensed Practitioner of the Healing Arts includes: Physician, Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, Registered Nurses, Re gistered Pharmacists, Licensed Clinical Psychologist (LCP), Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW), Licensed Professional Clinical Counselor (LPCC), and Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist (LMFT) and licensed -eligible practitioners working under the supervision of licensed clinicians. b. Non-professional staff shall receive appropriate on -site orientation and training prior to performing assigned duties. Non -professional staff will be supervised by professional and/or administrative staff. c. Professional and non-professional staff are required to have appropriate experience and any necessary training at the time of hiring. d. Registered and certified alcohol and other drug counselors must adhere to all requirements in the California Code of Regulations, Title 9, Chapter 8. 143. Responsibilities of Counties for DMC -ODS Benefits The responsibilities of counties for the DMC -ODS benefit shall be consistent with each county's intergovernmental agreement with DHCS, and shall include that counties do the following. a. Selective Provider Contracting Requirements for Counties: Counties may choose the DMC providers to participate in the DMC -ODS. DMC certified providers that do not receive a county contract cannot receive a direct contract with the State in counties which opt into the Pilot. If a county does not participate in the Pilot or is removed from participation in the Pilot by the State, the county will continue to cover state plan services. b. Access: Each county must e nsure that all required services covered under the DMC -ODS Pilot are available and accessible to enrollees of the DMC -ODS. NTP services are an important modality within the continuum of care. Counties are required to provide this service. Access to medical ly necessary NTP services cannot be denied for DMC -ODS eligible beneficiaries. Eligible DMC -ODS beneficiaries will receive medically necessary services at a DMC certified NTP provider. All DMC -ODS services, including Medi -Cal NTP services, shall be furnished with reasonable promptness in accordance with California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 105 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 federal Medicaid requirements and as specified in the county implementation plan and state/county intergovernmental agreement (managed care contracts per federal definition). Medical attention for eme rgency and crisis medical conditions must be provided immediately. If the DMC -ODS network is unable to provide services, the county must adequately and timely cover these services out-of-network for as long as the county is unable to provide them. c. All coun ties must ensure that beneficiaries who live in an opt -out county, but receive NTP services in an opt -in county do not experience a disruption of services. The opt -out county will claim state plan expenditures for the reimbursement made to the out -of-count y NTP providers in accordance with the approved state plan methodology for services furnished to beneficiaries. No persons eligible for DMC -ODS services, including Medi -Cal funded NTP treatment services, will be placed on waiting lists for such services due to budgetary constraints. d. The DMC -ODS Pilot program is administered locally by each demonstration county and each county provides for, or arranges for, substance use disorder treatment for Medi -Cal beneficiaries. Access cannot be limited in any way when counties select providers. Access to State Plan services must remain at the current level or expand upon implementation of the Pilot. The county shall maintain and monitor a network of appropriate providers that is supported by contracts with subcontract ors and that is sufficient to provide adequate access to all services covered under this Pilot. Access for this purpose is defined as timeliness to care as specified below. In establishing and monitoring the network, the county must consider the following: i. Require its providers to meet Department standards for timely access to care and services as specified in the county implementation plan and state -county intergovernmental agreements (managed care contracts per federal definition). Medical attention for emergency and crisis medical conditions must be provided immediately. ii. The anticipated number of Medi -Cal eligible clients. iii. The expected utilization of services, taking into account the characteristics and substance use disorder needs of beneficiaries. iv. The expected number and types of providers in terms of training and experience needed to meet expected utilization. v. The number of network providers who are not accepting new beneficiaries. vi. The geographic location of providers and their accessibility to beneficiaries, considering distance, travel time, means of transportation ordinarily used by Medi -Cal beneficiaries, and physical access for disable beneficiaries. 144. Medication Assisted Treatment Services : Counties must describe in their implementation plan how they will guarantee access to medication assisted treatment California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 106 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 services. a. Counties currently with inadequate access to medication assisted treatment services must describe in their implementation plan how they will provide the service modality. b. Counties are encouraged to increase medication assisted treatment services by exploring the use of the following interventions: i. Extend NTP/OTP programs to remote locations using mobile units and contracted pharmacies which may have onsite counseling and urinalysis. ii. Implement medication management protocols for alcohol dependence including naltrexone, disulfiram, and acamprosate. Alcohol maintenance medications may be dispensed onsite in NTPs/OTPs or prescribed by providers in outpatient programs. iii. Provide ambulatory alcohol detoxification services in settings such as outpatient programs, NTPs/OTPs, and contracted pharmacies. c. Selection Criteria and Provider Contracting Requirements: In selecting providers to furnish services under this Pilot, counties must: i. Must have written policies and procedures for selection and retention of providers that are in compliance with the terms and conditions of this amendment and applicable federal laws and regulations. ii. Apply those policies and procedures equally to all providers regard less of public, private, for -profit or non -profit status, and without regard to whether a provider treats persons who require high-risk or specialized services. iii. Must not discriminate against persons who require high -risk or specialized services. iv. May contract with providers in another state where out -of-state care or treatment is rendered on an emergency basis or is otherwise in the best interests of the person under the circumstances. v.

Select only providers that, prior to the furnishing of services under this pilot, have enrolled with, or revalidated their current enrollment with, DHCS as a DMC provider under applicable federal and state regulati ons, have been screened in accordance with 42 CFR 455.450(c) as a \"high\" categorical risk prior to furnishing services under this pilot, have signed a Medicaid provider agreement with DHCS as required by 42 CFR 431.107, and have complied with the ownership and control disclosure requirements of 42 CFR 455.104. DHCS shall deny enrollment and DMC certification to any provider (as defined in Welfare & Institutions Code section 14043.1), or a person with ownership or control interest in the provider (as defined in 42 CFR 455.101), California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 107 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 that, at the time of application, is under investigation for fraud or abuse pursuant to Part 455 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, unless DHCS determines that there is good cause not to deny enrollment upon the same bases enumerated in 42 CFR 455.23(e) If a provider is under investigation for fraud or abuse, that provider shall be subject to temporary suspension pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code section 14043.36. Upon receipt of a credible allegation of fraud, a prov ider shall be subject to a payment suspension pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code section 14107.11 and DHCS may thereafter collect any overpayment identified through an audit or examination. During the time a provider is subject to a temporary suspensi on pursuant to Welfare & Institutions Code section 14043.36, the provider, or a person with ownership or control interest in the provider (as defined in 42 CFR 455.101), may not receive reimbursement for services provided to a DMC -ODS beneficiary. A provi der, shall be subject to suspension pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 14043.61 if claims for payment are submitted for services provided to a Medi -Cal beneficiary by an individual or entity that is ineligible to participate in the Medi -Cal program. A provider will be subject to termination of provisional provider status pursuant to Welfare and Institutions Code section 14043.27 if the provider has a debt due and owing to any government entity that relates to any federal or state health care program, and has not been excused by legal process from fulfilling the obligation. Only providers newly enrolling or revalidating their current enrollment on or after January 1, 2015 would be required to undergo fingerprint - based background checks require d under 42 CFR 455.434. vii. Select only providers that have a Medical Director who, prior to the delivery of services under this pilot, has enrolled with DHCS under applicable state regulations, has been screened in accordance with 42 CFR 455.450(a) as a \"limited\" categorical risk within a year prior to serving as a Medical Director under this pilot, and has signed a Medicaid provider agreement with DHCS as required by 42 CFR 431.107. viii. Counties may contract individually with licensed LPHAs to provide services in the network. ix. Must not discriminate in the selection, reimbursement, or indemnification of any provider who is acting within the scope of their certification. x. Must enter into contracts with providers that they have selected to furnish services u nder this pilot program. All contracts with providers must include the following provider requirements: A. Services furnished to beneficiaries by the provider under this amendment are safe, effective, patient -centered, timely, California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 108 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 culturally competent, efficient and equitable, as defined by the Institute of Medicine; B.

Contract Denial: Counties shall serve providers that apply to be a contract provider but are not selected a written decision including the basis for the denial. a. County Protest: Any solicitation document utilized by counties for the selection of DMC providers must include a protest provision. i. Counties shall have a protest procedure for providers that are not awarded a contract. ii. The protest procedure shall include requirements outlined in the State /County contract. iii. Providers that submit a bid to be a contract provider, but are not selected, must exhaust the county's protest procedure if a provider wishes to challenge the denial to the Department of Health Care Services (DHCS). If the county does not render a decision within 30 calendar days after the protest was filed with the county, the protest shall be deemed denied and the provider may appeal the failure to DHCS. b. DHCS Appeal Process: A provider may appeal to DHCS as outlined in Attachment Y. 146. Authorization: Counties must provide prior authorization for residential services within 24 hours of the prior authorization request being submitted by the provider. Counties will review the DSM and ASAM Criteria to ensure that the beneficiary meets the requirements for the service. Counties shall have written policies and procedures for processing requests for initial and continuing authorization of services. Counties are to have a mechanism in place to ensure that there is consistent application of revi ew criteria for authorization California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 109 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 decisions and shall consult with the requesting provider when appropriate. Counties are to meet the established timelines for decisions for service authorization. Counties are required to track the number, percentage of denie d and timeliness of requests for authorization for all DMC -ODS services that are submitted, processed, approved and denied. This prior authorization for residential services is compliant with the Medicaid - applicable parity requirements established by the M ental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Non -residential services shall not require prior authorization. a. County Implementation Plan: Counties must submit to the State a plan on their implementation of DMC -ODS. The State will provide the template for the implementation plan, which is included here as Attachment Z. Counties cannot commence services without an implementation plan approved by the state and CMS. Counties must also have an executed State/County intergovernmental agreement (managed care contract per federal definition) with the county Board of Supervisors and approved by CMS. County implementation plans must ensure that providers are appropriately certified for the services contracted, implementing at least two evidenced based practices, trained in ASAM Criteria, and participating in efforts to promote culturally competent service delivery. b. One ASAM level of Residential Treatment Services is required for approval of a county implementation plan in the first year. The county implementation plan must demonstrate ASAM levels of Residential Treatment Services (Levels 3.1- 3.5) within three years of CMS approval of the county implementation plan and state - county intergovernmental agreement (managed care contract per federal definition). The cou nty implementation plan must describe coordination for ASAM Levels 3.7 and 4.0. c. Upon CMS approval of the implementation plan and an executed contract, counties will be able to bill prospectively for services provided through this Pilot. d. Below is a summary of the requirements that must be submitted with the county implementation plan: Care coordination strategy MOU with managed care plan DMC transitions, especially aftercare and recovery supports California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 110 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Service descriptions Withdrawal Management Outpatient Intensive Outpatient NTP/OTP Additional MAT Residential Recovery Services Case Management Physician Consultation Two evidence -based practices Any optional services (including partial hospitalization) Provider network development plan By service With timeline pegged to specified timeliness standard Network adequacy requirements (will vary by county) Phase -in description for a one -year provisional period* By service With timeline and deliverables pegged to timeliness measure *Only applies to counties unable to meet all mandatory requirements. 147. Provisional Option: For counties that are unable to comply fully with the mandatory requirements upon implementation of this Pilot, at the time of approval by DHCS and CMS, there exists the option for a one -year provisional period. A one year -provisional option will provide counties the opportunity to participate in the DMC -ODS Pilot while taking the necessary steps to build system capacity, provide training, ensure appropriate care coordination, and implement a full network of providers as described in the Pilot. a. In order to apply for the one -year provisional option, a county must include with their implementation plan a strategy for coming into full compliance with the terms of this Pilot. Specifically, each county must describe the steps it will take to provide all required DMC -ODS services that it cannot provide upon initial DMC - ODS implementation. The county will assure that all DMC -ODS services will be available to beneficiaries (whether the services are p rovided in-network, out-of-network, or using telehealth) while meeting the timeliness requirement during the course of the one -year probation option. b. At least sixty (60) days prior to the expiration of the one -year provisional period, counties must resubmi t their revised implementation plans for renewal. The plans will describe how the county has implemented the requirements which they originally could not provide. DHCS and CMS will review the revised implementation plans, in conjunction with the state and county monitoring reports as described in Sections 5 and 6 of this amendment, to assess if the county is progressing towards complying fully with the terms of this Pilot. If a county originally awarded a one -year provisional option is able to fully comply with the terms of this Pilot upon California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 111 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 renewal, they will be eligible to receive approval to participate in the remainder of the Pilot. If a county originally awarded a one- year provisional option is not able to fully comply with the terms of this Pilot, DHCS and CMS may approve a renewal pursuant to a Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The CAP will describe how the county will continue to implement its phase -in approach pursuant to its implementation plan, and will assure that all DMC -ODS services are available to beneficiaries in the interim (whether the services are provided are in -network, out -of-network, or using telehealth) within the timeliness requirement. 148. State -County Intergovernmental Agreement (Managed Care Contract per federal definition): DHCS will require a State -County intergovernmental agreement (managed care contract per federal definition) to be signed between the state and the county in opt - in counties, subject to CMS approval. The intergovernmental agreement will provide further detailed requi rements including but not limited to access, monitoring, appeals and other provisions. Access standards and timeliness requirements that are specified and described in the county implementation plans will be referenced in the state/county intergovernmental agreements (managed care contract per federal definition). CMS will review and approve the State -County intergovernmental agreement (managed care contract per federal definition) to ensure that the DMC -ODS program is operated in a manner that reduces the risk of fraud and abuse to the maximum extent feasible. 149. Coordination with DMC -ODS Providers: Counties will include the following provider requirements within their contracts with the providers. a. Culturally Competent Services: Providers are responsible to provide culturally competent services. Providers must ensure that their policies, procedures, and practices are consistent with the principles outlined and are embedded in the organizational structure, as well as being upheld in day-to- day operations. Translation services must be available for beneficiaries, as needed. b. Medication Assisted Treatment: Providers will have procedures for linkage/integration for beneficiaries requiring medication assisted treatment. Provider staff will regularly communicate wit h physicians of clients who are prescribed these medications unless the client refuses to consent to sign a 42 CFR part 2 compliant release of information for this purpose. c. Evidenced Based Practices: Providers will implement at least two of the following e videnced based treatment practices (EBPs) based on the timeline established in the county implementation plan. The two EBPs are per provider per service modality. Counties will ensure the providers have implemented EBPs. The State will monitor the implementation of EBP's during reviews. The required EBP include: i. Motivational Interviewing: A client -centered, empathic, but directive counseling strategy designed to explore and reduce a person's ambivalence toward treatment. This approach frequently inc ludes other problem solving or solution -focused strategies that build on clients' past successes. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 112 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 ii. Cognitive -Behavioral Therapy: Based on the theory that most emotional and behavioral reactions are learned and that new ways of reacting and behaving can be learned. iii. Relapse Prevention: A behavioral self -control program that teaches individuals with substance addiction how to anticipate and cope with the potential for relapse. Relapse prevention can be used as a stand -alone substance use treatment program or as an aftercare program to sustain gains achieved during initial substance use treatment. iv. Trauma -Informed Treatment: Services must take into account an understanding of trauma, and place priority on trauma survivors' safety, choice and control. v. Psycho -Educ ation: Psycho -educational groups are designed to educate clients about substance abuse, and related behaviors and consequences. Psycho -educational groups provide information designed to have a direct application to clients' lives; to instill self- awarenes s, suggest options for growth and change, identify community resources that can assist clients in recovery, develop an understanding of the process of recovery, and prompt people using substances to take action on their own behalf. 150. Beneficiary Access Number : All counties shall have a 24/7 toll free number for prospective beneficiaries to call to access DMC -ODS services. Oral interpretation services must be made available for beneficiaries, as needed. 151. Beneficiary Informing : Upon first contact with a be neficiary or referral, counties shall inform beneficiaries about the amount, duration and scope of services under this waiver in sufficient detail to ensure that the beneficiaries understand the benefits to which they are entitled. 152. Care Coordination: Coun ties' implementation plans and state/county contracts (managed care contracts per federal definition) will describe their care coordination plan for achieving seamless transitions of care. Counties are responsible for developing a structured approach to care coordination to ensure that beneficiaries successfully transition between levels of SUD care (i.e. withdrawal management, residential, outpatient) without disruptions to services. In addition to specifying how beneficiaries will transition across leve ls of acute and short -term SUD care without gaps in treatment, the county will describe in the implementation plan and state/county intergovernmental agreement (managed care contracts per federal definition) how beneficiaries will access recovery supports and services immediately after discharge or upon completion of an acute care stay, with the goal of sustained engagement and long -term retention in SUD and behavioral health treatment. a. The county implementation plan and state/county intergovernmental agreement (managed care contract per federal definition) will indicate whether their care transitions approach will be achieved exclusively through case management services or through other methods. The county implementation plan and state/county intergovernm ental agreement (managed care contract per federal definition) will indicate which beneficiaries receiving SUD California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 113 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 services will receive care coordination. b. The participating county shall enter into a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with any Medi -Cal managed care plan that enrolls beneficiaries served by the DMC -ODS. This requirement can be met through an amendment to the Specialty Mental Health Managed Care Plan MOU. The components of the MOUs governing the interaction between the counties and managed care pl ans related to substance use disorder will be included as part of the counties' implementation plan. If upon submission of an implementation plan, the managed care plan(s) has not signed the MOU(s), the county may explain to the State the efforts undertak en to have the MOU(s) signed and the expected timeline for receipt of the signed MOU(s). Any MOU shall be consistent with the confidentiality provisions of 42 CFR Part 2. c. The following elements in the MOU should be implemented at the point of care to ensu re clinical integration between DMC -ODS and managed care providers: i. Comprehensive substance use, physical, and mental health screening, including ASAM Level 0.5 SBIRT services; ii. Beneficiary engagement and participation in an integrated care program as needed; iii. Shared development of care plans by the beneficiary, caregivers and all providers; iv. Collaborative treatment planning with managed care; v. Delineation of case management responsibilities; vi. A process for resolving disputes between the county and the Medi - Cal managed care plan that includes a means for beneficiaries to receive medically necessary services while the dispute is being resolved; vii. Availability of clinical consultation, including consultation on medications; viii. Care coordination and effective commun ication among providers including procedures for exchanges of medical information; ix. Navigation support for patients and caregivers; and x. Facilitation and tracking of referrals between systems including bidirectional referral protocols. 153. Integration with Primary Care: DHCS is committed to participate in the Medicaid Innovation Accelerator Program initiative for substance use disorder, specifically in the Targeted Learning Opportunity topics on primary care and SUD integration. DHCS is embarking on a strategy to integrate physical and behavioral health care services delivered to beneficiaries in order to improve health outcomes for beneficiaries with SUD and reduce costs in the Medi -Cal program. DHCS will explore options for identifying the best integr ation strategy upon approval of this waiver amendment and California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 114 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 will commit to specifying an integration approach by April 1, 2016. DHCS will produce a concept design for an integrated care model by October 1, 2016, with the goal of implementing physical and beh avioral health integration by April 1, 2017. 154. ASAM Designation for Residential Providers : In order to enroll in Medi -Cal and bill for services under the auspices of this waiver, all residential providers must be designated to have met the ASAM requirements described in STC 144 . DHCS will develop a designation program by July 1, 2015 to certify that all providers of Adult and Adolescent Level 3.1 -3.5 Residential/Inpatient Services are capable of delivering care consistent with ASAM criteria. As part of this designation program, DHCS will use an existing tool or develop a tool that includes the elements that define each sublevel of Level 3 services for Levels 3.1- 3.5, develop standard program audit materials and protocols, and implement the ASAM designation p rogram. The timeline for this designation program is outlined in an attachment and will be technically amended after the program has been developed. 155. Services for Adolescents and Youth : At a minimum, assessment and services for adolescents will follow the ASAM adolescent treatment criteria. In addition, the state will identify recovery services geared towards adolescents, such as those described in the January 26, 2015 CMS Informational Bulletin \"Coverage for Behavioral Health Services for Youth with Substa nce Use Disorder\". 156. DMC -ODS State Oversight, Monitoring, and Reporting . a. Monitoring Plan : The State shall maintain a plan for oversight and monitoring of DMC - ODS providers and counties to ensure compliance and corrective action with standards, access, and delivery of quality care and services. The state/county intergovernmental agreement (managed care contracts per federal definition) will require counties to monitor providers at least once per year, and the state to monitor the counties at least once per year through the External Quality Review Organizations (EQRO). If significant deficiencies or significant evidence of noncompliance with the terms of this waiver, the county implementation plan or the state/county intergovernmental agreement are found in a county, DHCS will engage the county to determine if there challenges that can be addressed with facilitation and technical assistance. If the county remains noncompliant, the county must submit a corrective action plan (CAP) to DHCS. The CAP must detail how and when the county will remedy the issue(s). DHCS may remove the county from participating in the Pilot if the CAP is not promptly implemented. b. Timely Access. The state must ensure that demonstration counties comply with network adequacy and access requirements, including that services are delivered in a culturally competent manner that is sufficient to provide access to covered services to Medi -Cal population. Providers must meet standards for timely access to care and services, considering the urge ncy of the service needed. Access standards and timeliness requirements that are specified and described in the county implementation plans will be referenced in the state/county intergovernmental agreements (managed care contract per federal definition). Medical attention for emergency and crisis medical conditions must be provided immediately. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 115 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 c. Program Integrity . The State has taken action to ensure the integrity of oversight processes and will continue to closely monitor for any wrongdoing that impacts the DMC -ODS. The State will continue to direct investigative staff, including trained auditors, nurse evaluators and peace officers to continue to discover and eliminate complex scams aimed at profiting from Medi -Cal. Efforts include extensive mining and analyzing of data to identify suspicious Drug Medi -Cal providers; designating DMC providers as \"high\" risk which requires additional onsite visits, fingerprinting and background checks (except for county providers); and regulations that strengthen DMC prog ram integrity by clarifying the requirements and responsibilities of DMC providers, DMC Medical Directors, and other provider personnel. In conducting site visits of providers seeking to furnish services under this Pilot, the State shall conduct a site visit monitoring review of every site through which the provider furnishes such services. In addition, providers that have not billed DMC in the last 12 months have been and will continue to be decertified. Counties are required to select and contract with providers according to the requirements specified in section 4(iv) of this amendment The State will ensure that the counties are providing the required services in the DMC - ODS, including but not limited to the proper application of the ASAM Criteria, through the initial approval in the county implementation plan and through the ongoing county monitoring. The State will conduct a state monitoring review for residential facilities to provide an ASAM designation prior to facilities providing Pilot service s. This review will ensure that the facility meets the requirements to operate at the designated ASAM level (as explained in 4(k)). d. Reporting of Activity: The State will report activity consistent with the Quarterly and Annual Progress Reports as set forth in this Waiver, Section IV, General Reporting Requirements. Such oversight, monitoring and reporting shall include all of the following: i. Enrollment information to include the number of DMC -ODS beneficiaries served in the DMC -ODS program. ii. Summary of operat ional, policy development, issues, complaints, grievances and appeals. The State will also include any trends discovered, the resolution of complaints and any actions taken or to be taken to prevent such issues, as appropriate. iii. Number of days to first DMC -ODS service at appropriate level of care after referral iv. Existence of a 24/7 telephone access line with prevalent non- English language(s) v. Access to DMC -ODS services with translation services in the prevalent non- English language(s) vi. Number, percentage and time period of authorization requests approved or denied e. Triennial Reviews : During the triennial reviews, the State will review the status of the Quality Improvement Plan and the county monitoring activities. This review will include the counties service delivery system, beneficiary protections, access to services, authorization for services, compliance with regulatory and contractual California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 116 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 requirements of the waiver, and a beneficiary records review. This triennial review will provide the State with information as to whether the counties are complying with their responsibility to monitor their service delivery capacity. The counties will receive a final report summarizing the findings of the triennial review and if out of compliance, the county must submit a pla n of correction (POC) within 60 days of receipt of the final report. The State will follow -up with the POC to ensure compliance. 157. DMC -ODS County Oversight, Monitoring and Reporting . The intergovernmental agreement with the state and counties that opt into the waiver must require counties to have a Quality Improvement Plan that includes the county's plan to monitor the service delivery, capacity as evidenced by a description of the current number, types and geographic distribution of substance use disorder s ervices. For counties that have an integrated mental health and substance use disorders department, this Quality Improvement Plan may be combined with the Mental Health Plan (MHP) Quality Improvement Plan. a. The county shall have a Quality Improvement comm ittee to review the quality of substance use disorders services provided to the beneficiary. For counties with an integrated mental health and substance use disorders department, the county may use the same committee with SUD participation as required in t he MHP contract. b. The QI committee shall recommend policy decisions; review and evaluate the results of QI activities; institute needed QI actions, ensure follow -up of QI process and document QI committee minutes regarding decisions and actions taken. The monitoring of accessibility of services outlined in the Quality Improvement Plan will at a minimum include: i. Timeliness of first initial contact to face -to-face appointment ii. Timeliness of services of the first dose of NTP services iii. Access to after -hours care iv. Responsiveness of the beneficiary access line v. Strategies to reduce avoidable hospitalizations vi. Coordination of physical and mental health services with waiver services at the provider level vii. Assessment of the beneficiaries' experiences viii. Telephone access line and services in the prevalent non -English languages. c. Each county's QI Committee should review the following data at a minimum on a quarterly basis since external quality review (EQR) site reviews will begin after county implementation. These data elements will be incorporated into the EQRO protocol. i. Number of days to first DMC -ODS service at appropriate level of care after referral ii. Existence of a 24/7 telephone access line with prevalent non- English language(s) iii. Access to DMC -ODS services with translation s ervices in the prevalent California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 117 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 non- English language(s) iv. Number, percentage of denied and time period of authorization requests approved or denied d. Counties will have a Utilization Management (UM) Program assuring that beneficiaries have appropriate access to sub stance use disorder services; medical necessity has been established and the beneficiary is at the appropriate ASAM level of care and that the interventions are appropriate for the diagnosis and level of care. Counties shall have a documented system for co llecting, maintaining and evaluating accessibility to care and waiting list information, including tracking the number of days to first DMC -ODS service at an appropriate level of care following initial request or referral for all DMC - ODS services. e. Counties will provide the necessary data and information required in order to comply with the evaluation required by the DMC -ODS. 158. DMC -ODS Financing For claiming federal financial participation (FFP), Counties will certify the total allowable expenditures incurred in providing the DMC - ODS waiver services provided either through county -operated providers (based on actual costs, consistent with a cost allocation methodology if warranted), contracted fee-for-service providers or contracted managed care plans ( based on actual expenditures). For contracted FFS providers , counties will propose county -specific rates except for the NTP/OTP modality and the State will approve or disapprove those rates. NTP/OTP reimbursement shall be set pursuant to the process set forth in Welfare and Institutions Code Section 14021.51. All NTP/OTP providers contracting with counties shall provide their county with financial data on an annual basis. This data is to be collected for the purpose of setting the rates after the expirati on of the waiver. The DHCS Rates Setting Workgroup shall propose a recommended format for this annual financial data and the State will approve a final format. Counties shall provide this financial data to the DHCS Rates Setting Workgroup upon its request. The provision in the Welfare and Institutions Code, Section 14124.24(h)) remains in effect and NTPs/OTPs will not be required to submit cost reports to the counties for the purpose of cost settlement . a. If during the State review process, the State denies t he proposed rates, the county will be provided the opportunity to adjust the rates and resubmit to the State. The State will retain all approval of the rates in order to assess that the rates are sufficient to ensure access to available DMC -ODS waiver serv ices. Rates will be set in the State and County intergovernmental agreement. For contracted managed care plans, counties will reimburse the managed care organizations the contracted capitation rate. A CMS -approved CPE protocol, based on actual allowable co sts, is required before FFP associated with waiver services is made available to the state. This approved CPE protocol (Attachment AA) must explain the process the State will use to determine costs incurred by the counties under this demonstration. b. Only st ate plan DMC services will be provided prior to the DHCS and CMS approval of the State/County intergovernmental agreement (managed care California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 118 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 contract per federal definition) and executed by the County Board of Supervisors. State plan DMC services will be reimbursed pursuant to the state plan reimbursement methodologies until a county is approved to begin DMC - ODS services. c. SB 1020 (Statutes of 2012) created the permanent structure for 2011 Realignment. It codified the Behavioral Health Subaccount which fund s programs including Drug Medi - Cal. Allocations of Realignment funds run on a fiscal year of October 1 -September 30. The monthly allocations are dispersed to counties from the State Controller's Office. The Department of Finance develops schedules, in co nsultation with appropriate state agencies and the California State Association of Counties (CSAC), for the allocation of Behavioral Health Subaccount funds to the counties. The base has not yet been set, as the State assesses the expenditures by county fo r these programs. The state will continue to monitor the BH subaccount and counties to ensure that SUD is not artificially underspent. d. Subject to the participation standards and process to be established by the State, counties may also pilot an alternative reimbursement structure, including but not limited to, for a DMC -ODS modality if both the provider of that modality and the county mutually and contractually agree to participate. This may include use of case rates. The State and CMS will have the final approval of any alternative reimbursement structure pilot proposed by the county, and such pilot structure must continue to meet the terms and conditions expressed herein, including but not limited to, the rate approval process described above. 159. DMC -ODS Evaluation Through an existing contract with DHCS, University of California, Los Angeles, (UCLA) Integrated Substance Abuse Programs will conduct an evaluation to measure and monitor the outcomes from the DMC -ODS Waiver. The design of the DMC -ODS evaluatio n will focus on the four key areas of access, quality, cost, and integration and coordination of care. Specifically, the data collection, reporting and analysis strategy for this waiver pro gram will be designed to assess: a. The impact of providing intensive outpatient SUD services in the community; b. The effectiveness of drug based SUD treatments; c. The impact of providin g residential SUD services; d. Whether the length of stay of residential SUD services affects the impact of such services; and e. 5) W hether the r esidential treatment methods affect the impact of such services. These impacts will be assessed in terms of beneficiary access, health care costs, outcomes and service utilization, and will utilize a comparison between comparable populations in opt -in counties and other counties. The measurement strategy will track readmission rates to the same level of SUD care or higher, emergency department utilization and inpatient hospital utilization. The measurement strategy will also evaluate successful care tra nsitions to outpatient care, including hand -offs between levels of care within the SUD continuum as well as linkages with primary care upon discharge. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 119 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 California will utilize the SUD data system currently in place known as the California Outcomes Measurem ent System (CalOMS). CalOMS captures data from all SUD treatment providers which receive any form of government funding. The CalOMS data set, along with additional waiver specific data, will enable the State to evaluate the effectiveness of the DMC -ODS. Th e design of the evaluation is contained in Attachment DD, UCLA Evaluation. The state will submit the complete design of the evaluation within 60 days of the approval of the amendment. One of the focuses of the first year of the evaluation will be that eac h opt -in county has an adequate number of contracts with NTP providers, access to NTP services has remained consistent or increased and that no disruption to NTP services has occurred as a result of the DMC -ODS. 160. Federal 42 CFR 438 and other Managed Care Requirements a. Any entity that receives a prepayment from the state to provide services to beneficiaries will be considered by federal definition, a managed care plan and held to all federal 42 CFR 438 requirements and requirements in this section. According ly, counties participating in this DMC -ODS Pilot program will be considered managed care plans. CMS will waive the following 438 requirement(s): i. 438.310 -370 (External Quality Review Organizations, or EQROs). Opt -in counties will include in their implementa tion plan a strategy and timeline for meeting EQR requirements. EQR requirements must be phased in within 12 months of having an approved implementation plan. EQRO monitoring visits will begin in March 2016 in Phase One counties and Phase Two counties will begin in September 2016. By January 2017, the EQRO will begin monitoring all Pilot counties phased into the DMC -ODS. ii. Implementation cannot begin prior to CMS review and approval of the State/County intergovernmental agreement (managed care plan contracts per federal definition). iii. At least sixty (60) days prior to CMS contract approval the state shall submit for each opt -in county the applicable network adequacy requirements as part of the county implementation plan. CMS concurrence with standards is require d. iv. At least sixty (60) days prior to CMS contract approval the state shall provide all deliverables necessary to indicate compliance with network adequacy requirements. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 120 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 XI. Negative Balance 161. Repayment of Payment Management System (PMS) Negative Account Balances: As of November 20, 2015, the total of all Medicaid and CHIP negative subaccount balances through Federal Fiscal Year 2013 for the State of California is $1,277,770,233 . In order to bring the accounts into balance, the State shall do the following: a. Issue Resolution. CMS and State shall work collaboratively to resolve outstanding issues, including action on deferred plan amendments, other open deferrals, delayed CMS -64 certifications, delayed certified public expenditure reconciliations, positive PMS account balances through FY 2013, the False Claim Act reduction, and overpayment of third party liability collections. By January 31, 2016, CMS and State will: i. Identify an d document outst anding issues; ii. Prioritize list; and iii. Create timeline for resolution of each issue by January 31, 2017. b. Repayment Process. i. Negative Account Balances - For any negative account balances unresolved as of January 31, 2017, CMS will issue a demand letter to the state identifying the final negative account balance amount and the state's right to appeal. CMS and the state will deve lop a repayment schedule in attachment PP that ensures repayment of any remaining amount of the negative account balances identified through Federal Fiscal Year 2013 through even quarterly installments, plus interest, over the life of the waiver. Addition al repayment requirements are identified in section C through H below. ii. Deferred Claims - For any deferred claims 1) not paid by CMS by January 31, 2017, 2) for which the state has drawn federal financial participation (FFP) from its PMS account, and 3) for which the state has not returned all drawn FFP to its PMS account by January 31, 2017, CMS shall proceed by disallowance in accordance with 42 CFR 430 Subpart C. The state may request a repayment schedule in accordance with 42 CFR 430 Subpart C. Thi s repayment is not subject to the provisions of subsection C through H below. c. Repayment Period Interest. Interest will accrue, at the Current Value of Funds Rate (CVFR) published by the U.S. Department of Treasury, from February 1, 2017 until the entir e principle amount is repaid in full. Each payment will be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal. After each payment, interest will continue to accrue on the remaining principal balance until the debt is paid in full or otherwise resolved by CMS. CMS will adjust the repayment schedule to reflect any changes to the CVFR during the repayment schedule. d. Source of Repayment Funds. The funding source of repayment cannot be derived from federal funds, including any Medicaid or CHIP funds av ailable to the state in FY 2014 or later PMS accounts. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 121 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 e. Mechanism of Repayment. The quarter payment amount due or payment in full may be sent via FedWire (preferred), Automated Clearing House (ACH), or check - specific instructions for FedWire or ACH may be obtained from your state's Division of Payment Management representative. The quarter payment amount due or in payment full via check should be made payable to: \"The Department of Health and Human Services\" and sent to the following address: HHS Pr ogram Support Center P. O. Box 530231 Atlanta, GA 30353 -0231 Please include your PMS account number and a brief description explaining the nature of the return. Please include a copy of this STC along with your payment. f. PMS Draws for Deferred FFP . When CMS issues a deferral of claims for FFP to the state in accordance with the timelines set forth in 42 CFR 430.40, the state must immediately return the deferred FFP to the applicable PMS subaccount while the deferral is being resolved. After CMS rev iews the deferred claims, CMS will determine the allowability of the claims. If CMS determines that a deferred claims are allowable under federal requirements, CMS will release the deferred funds to the appropriate PMS subaccount and will notify Californi a that the funds are available for draw. g. Adjustments to Repayment Schedule. The state may request a recalculation of the repayment schedule from CMS if the state decides to make accelerated repayment installments. CMS will also adjust and reissue the rep ayment schedule to reflect any positive Medicaid grant awards issued that reduce the outstanding negative account balance amounts in any of the following PMS subaccounts: i. FY 2009 and Prior MT ii. XIX-MAP11 iii. iv. HIT-IMP13 h. Cash Management Improvement Act (CMIA) Agreement. The Repayment of Payment Management System (PMS) Negative Account Balances section of these STCs does not preclude action by other federal agencies, including the United States Department of Treasury resulting from a violation of the CMIA agreement between the State of California and the United States Department of Treasury. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 122 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 XII. Global Payment 162. Global Payment Program for Public Health Care Systems a. California wil l operate a global payment program (GPP) to assist public health care systems (PHCS) that provide health care for the uninsured. The GPP is meant to focus on value, rather than volume, of care provided. The purpose is to support PHCS for their key role in providing services to California's remaining uninsured and to promote the delivery of more cost -effective and higher -value care to the uninsured . Promoting more cost -effective and higher value care means that the payment structure will reward the provision of care in more appropriate venues, rather than through the emergency department or through inpatient hospital s ettings . The State will test a new approach to assist PHCS, and will evaluate the success of the GPP for potentially broader applicat ion. b. Under the GPP, participating PHCS will receive GPP payments that will be calculated using a value -based point methodology that incorporate s factors that shift the overall delivery of services for the uninsured to more appropriate settings and reinfor ce structural changes to the care delivery system that will improve the options for treating both Medicaid and uninsured patients. The methodology for setting service values will incorporate measures of value for the patient in conjunction with the recogni tion of costs to the health care system. Care being received in appropriate settings will be valued relatively higher than care given in inappropriate care settings for the type of illness . c. Payments will not exceed the limits in Attachment EE but may be le ss if the thresholds are not achieved . Services will be grouped into categories that reflect where care is being provided. Within each category services will be grouped into tiers of similar service intensity. This will assist in modifying relative values of services, so that their long term value is incorporated and no longer an externality. Service tiers across categories that aim to provide the same end result would have relative values of generally equivalent care. The intent of this framework is to pro vide flexibility in provision of services while encouraging a broad shift to more cost -effective care that is person -centered. d. The total amount available for the GPP is a combin ation of portion the state's DSH allotment that would otherwise be allocated to the PHCS and the amount associated with the Safety Net Care Uncompensated Care Pool under the Bridge to Reform demonstration. 163. Entities Eligible to Receive Global Payments Payments under the GPP are available for PHCS that are comprised of a designated public hospital (DPH) identified in Attachment C that agrees to participate in the GPP and the DPH's affiliated and contracted providers (collectively, for purposes of the GPP only, Public Health Care System or \"PHCS\") . For purposes of the GPP, multiple DPHs and their affiliated and contracted providers may comprise a single PHCS in accordance with criteria established and set forth in Attachment EE (GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol ). DHCS shall identify to CMS all PHCS that will participate in the GPP. A list of Public Health Care Systems is set forth in Attac hment C. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 123 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 164. General Overview of Global Payments a. Global payments shall be available based on a GPP program year that aligns with the state fiscal year from July 1 through June 30 (\"GPP PY\"). The first GPP PY is for the period July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016. b. An annual GPP budget for each participating PHCS shall be established in accordance with the parame ters set forth in Attachment EE (GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol). The aggregate GPP budget among participating PHCS shal l not exceed the total computable amount of G PP funds available in a given GPP PY, as established by the limits set forth in STC 180 . c. PHCS shall be required to provide a threshold amount of care, measured in points, to earn their entire annual GPP budget amount. Points for services will be assigned in a manner that incorporates measures of value for the patient and that achieves other programmatic goals, as set forth in Attachment FF Valuation of Services . d. Each PHCS annual threshold point amount is determined through a baseline analysis, accounting for factors such as its historical and projected volume, cost and mix of services to the uninsured and estimated need, determined in accordance with Attachment FF . These thresholds will ensure that PHCS only receive full GPP payments if the PHCS provides levels of services to the uninsured population necessary to meet its threshold that has been set based on the level of services that would otherwise have been provided to the uninsured . For purposes of the GPP, care will be considered uninsured for individuals for whom there is no source of third party coverage for the specific service furnished by the PHCS . Furthermore, an individual will not be considered uninsured with regard to a non -traditional service (as identifie d in Attachment FF, GPP Va luation Methodology Protocol) he or she receives from the PHCS if the individual has a source of third party coverage for the category of service for which the non -traditional service is being used as a substitute. e. Interim GPP payments shall be made to PHCS on a quarterly basis, calculated as 25% of the PHCS' s annual global budget. Within nine months following the end of each GPP PY, the State shall reconcile interim payments to the amount earned for services as established by the reports submitted in ac cordance with f. below. f. Attachment EE (GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol) sets forth a reporting schedule by which each PHCS will report its actual services provided under the GPP, the corresponding points valuation, and the payments due. The report sh all at least include the GPP -related services furnished by the PHCS during the applicable year, reported by category, tier, and type, and shall serve as the basis for reconciling interim GPP payments with final amounts due. As payments for services under the GPP are based on point value, no cost reconciliation protocol will apply. PHCS shall not be subject to the reporting requirements of 42 C.F.R. Section 447.299. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 124 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 g. The full amount of a PHCS global budget shall be payable to the PHCS if it meets or exceeds its designated threshold for a given GPP PY. In the event a PHCS does not achieve or exceed its threshold for a given GPP PY, the PHCS' s GPP payment shall equal its global budget as reduced by the proportion by which it fell short of its threshold. h. The State, in accordance with proced ures set forth in Attachment EE (GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol ), shall redistribute unearned GPP funds that were available in a given GPP PY amongst other PHCS that have exceeded their respective threshold for that yea r. i. The non -federal share of GPP payments will be provided by PHCS through intergovernmental transfers (IGT), subject to th e requirements of STC 188 (Sources of Non -Federal Share) below. Upon receipt of the IGTs, DHCS will draw the federal funding and pa y both the non -federal and federal shares of the applicable GPP payments in accordance with the requirements and schedules descri bed herein and in Attachment EE (GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol). In the event GPP payments are recouped upon reconciliation, DHCS will repay the corresponding federal share to CMS in accordance with federal regulations at 42 CFR 430.30, et seq . j. GPP payments determined annually for each eligible PHCS , after accounting for finalization of the applicable DSH allot ment and subparagraphs g and h as applicable , represent the final amounts available for that GPP PY. 165. Valuation of Services. a. Services under the GPP shall be valued in accordance with the methodo logy set forth in Attachment FF (GPP Valuation Methodology). The valuation methodology allows for the continuation of services provided by Public Health Care Systems that were reimbursed under the previous Demonstration's DSH and SNCP structure, while encouraging more cost -effective and innovative care where appro priate. Point values shall also be developed for those innovative or alternative services where there is currently little to no reimbursement. The valuation methodology reflects the following programmatic goals: i. Facilitate a shift away from the previous cost -based payment that was restricted to mostly hospital settings and subject to prolonged periods of cost reconciliation; ii. Broaden the settings in which Public Health Care Systems receive payment for services fur nished to the uninsured, and encourages Public Health Care Systems to provide greater primary and preventive services, as well as to create access to alternative modalities such as telehealth, group visits and health coaching; iii. Emphasize coordinated care a nd alternative modalities by recognizing the higher value of access to primary care, ambulatory care, and other core components of care management, as compared to the higher cost of avoidable emergency room visits and acute care hospital stays; California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 125 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 iv. Recognize t he value of services that typically are not directly or separately reimbursed by Medicaid or other payors (\"non -traditional\" services), and that substitute or complement services for which payment is typically available upon provision of the service (\"trad itional\" services). b. All services eligible for points under the GPP are grouped into the four categories described below in \"Categories\" : Services within the categories are further stratified into tiers based on similar service intensity, activity and/or effort. Relative p oint values are assigned to tiers for purposes of repo rting and generating payments. c. The valuation methodology incorpor ates a phased approach in which traditional services, over the course of the Demonstration term, reflect reduced point values. High intensity services will continue to be recognized for their value and importance, including recognition in the point system that emergency room visits and inpatient stays may be necessary and appropriate. d. Relative values will be initially set based on cost and then adjusted to a limited degree based on other measures of value, in order to assist in maintaining accountabilit y for the amount of services provided compared to the funding Public Health Care Systems receive. Higher relative value points may be assigned to services, including non -traditional services that help promote one or more of the objectives from the list be low; however, the relative point value of services , except for those services for which cost information is not readily available , such as non - traditional services , may not vary from their initial cost -based amounts by more than 40 percent at any time duri ng the GPP. i. Timeliness and convenience of service to patient ; ii. Increased access to care ; iii. Earlier intervention ; iv. Appropriate resource use for a given outcome ; v. Health and wellness services that result in improved patient ; decisions and overall health status ; vi. Potential to mitigate future costs ; vii. Preventive services; viii. Likelihood of bringing a patient into an organized system of care; ix. Additional criteria, to be designed by the state ; e. In GPP PYs in which point revaluation has occurred, p oint revaluation must be calibrated so that the overall impact would not lead to any PHCS receiving additional total points in any given GPP PY if its utilization and the mix of services provided remained the same as in the baseline period used to determine the designated thres hold. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 126 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 f. The exact methodology for assigning points to the services will be provided for CMS approval in Attachme nt FF . The methodology will require CMS approval before it can be implemented. If the state proposes to change point valuations or add new servic es, it must obtain CMS approval before they may be implemented in the program. g. PHCS are not required to provide every serv ice identified on Attachment FF (GPP Valuation Methodology), but are allowed the flexibility to provide services, through their glob al payments budgets and service -related point thresholds, to address local needs. 166. Global Payment Protocols. Within 60 days of CMS approval of the terms and conditions for Medi -Cal 2020, CMS and the State will, through a collaborative process, develop and finalize Global Payment Funding and Mechanic Protocols, and Global Payment Valuation Protocol. These documents will be incorporated into the STCs as Attachments EE and FF , respectively). 167. Funding and Annual Limits a. Under this new approach, the state's existing Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) funding for participating PHCS and funding from the UC Pool will be combined to make payments to participating PHCS that incur costs for services to the remaining uninsured . During each GPP PY, FFP will be available for such GPP payment expenditures up to the amount equal to the state's entire DSH allotment as set forth in section 1923(f) of the Act, adjusted as described in subparagraphs of this STC b and .c below (\"Adjust ed DSH\"), combined with the additional Demonstration UC funding amounts as set forth in subparagraph d below. In order to align DSH amounts with each SFY, the state's DSH allotment for the federal fiscal year that com mences in the SFY will be used . b. A po rtion of California's DSH allotment shall be set aside for those California DSH facilities that do not participate in the GPP. The amount set aside shall be identified in Attachment EE (GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol). c. In any year to which reductions to California's DSH allotment are required by section 1923(f)(7) of the Social Security Act, the amount of the DSH allotment attributable to GPP in a given GPP PY shall be reduced consistent with CMS guidelines. d. The total computable amount available for the UC component shall equal $472 million in GPP PY1. For GPP PYs 2 through 5 the UC component will be determined by CMS based upon the information contained in the Independent Report on Uncompensated Care . Such reductions shall be specified by CMS within 60 days of receipt of such report. Taken together, the total computable annual limits for GPP payments will not exceed the limits set forth below: California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 127 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 GPP PY 1 (SFY 15 -16) - Adjusted DSH + $472 million = approximately $2. 9 billion GPP PY 2 (SFY 16 -17) - Adjusted DSH + UC component GPP PY 3 (SFY 17 -18) - Adjusted DSH + UC component GPP PY 4 (SFY 18 -19) - Adjusted DSH + UC component GPP PY 5 (SFY 19-20) - Adjusted DSH + UC component e. The non -federal share of payments under the GPP shall be funded by voluntary intergovernmental transfers made by PHCS, or governmental agencies affiliated with PHC S. The funding entity shall certify that the funds transferred qualify for federal financial participation pursuant to 42 C.F.R. part 433 subpart B, and are not derived from impermissible sources such as recycled Medicaid payments, federal money excluded from use as State match, impermissible taxes, and non - bona fide provider -related donations. The State must have permissible sources for the non -federal share o f GPP expenditures, which may include permissible Intergovernmental Transfers (IGTs) from government -operated entities and state funds. Sources of non -federal funding shall not include provider taxes or donations impermissible under section 1903(w), imperm issible intergovernmental transfers from providers, or federal funds received from federal programs other than Medicaid (unless expressly authorized by federal statute to be used for claiming purposes, and the federal Medicaid funding is credited to the ot her federal funding source). For this purpose, federal funds do not include PRIME payments, patient care revenue received as payment for services rendered under programs such as the Designated State Health Programs, Medicare, or Medicaid. f. The state will ensure that any lack of adequate funds from local sources will not result in lowering the amount, duration, scope or quality of Medicaid services available under the state plan or this demonstration. The preceding sentence is not intended to preclude the state from modifying the Medicaid benefit through the state plan amendment process . 168. Categories . Each service will be assigned into a category by the state that best reflects its characteristics of intensity and area delivered. These categories will ass ist in determining the point values of individual services. The categories listed below are intended to provide a broad overview of the categories and services. The full description of categories are included in Attachment FF a. Category 1 : Traditional Out patient - This category includes traditional outpatient services provided by a public hospital system facility: ii. Non-physician practitioner; iii. Traditional, provider -based primary care or specialty care visit; iv. Mental health visit; v. Dental; vi. Emergency room/Urgent Care; California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 128 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 ix. Outpatient procedures/surgery, provider performed diagnostic procedures; b. Category 2 : Non-Traditional Outpatient - This category includes non -traditional outpatient encounters, where care is provided by non-traditional providers or in non - traditional settings: x. Community health worker encounters; xi. Health coach encounters; xii. Care navigation; xiii. Health education & community wellness encounters; c. Category 3 : Technology -Based Outpatient - This category includes technology - based outpatient encounters that rely mainly on technology to provide care: xiv. Call line encounters; xv. Texting; xvi. Telephone and consultations between provider xvii. Provider -to-provider eConsults for specialty care; xviii. Telemedicine; d. Category 4: Inpatient and Facility Stays - This category includes traditional inpatient and facility stays by patients: xix. Recuperative/respite days; xxii. Skilled nursing facility days; 169. Service Threshold The threshold amounts for each PHCS will initially be constructed using the volume and cost of services occurring in participating providers, and will use the most recent complete state fiscal year data (Base SFY). Point values for each service will be consistent across all providers. The threshold amounts shall be determined in accordance with the methodology set forth in Attachment EE (GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol), which takes into account the following requirements and factors: a. Historic point val ues for each service category on a per unit of service basis across all Public Health Care Systems, taking into account at a minimum varying methods for identifying units and categories of services, cost per unit, cost trends and service mix; b. Base SFY ut ilization for each Public Health Care System; and c. Adjustments to account for changes in uninsured service needs since Base SFY, including the coverage expansions resulting from ACA implementation. d. This threshold will require approval by CMS before it can b e finalized. i. Thresholds for GPP PY2 -PY5 will decline in proportion to reductions in annual limits. 170. Penalties for non -compliance If the state does not timely submit the final report as required in STC 187 below, including all requested analyses and recommendations, the state's expenditure authority for uncompensated care pools will be reduced by $500,000. The state may seek, and CMS may grant, relief from this reduction, if needed. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 129 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 171. Global Payment P rogram Protocols The GPP Funding and Mechanics Protocol (Attachment EE) and a GPP Valuation Methodology Protocol (Attachment FF) set forth in detail the parameters and procedures related to the operation of the GPP. 172. Global Payment Program Value Methodology Protocol includes the following: : a. The master list of services and activities for which points apply under the GPP and their associated point values, including the placement of services within the categories and ti ers and how point values will change over the course of the Demonstration b. Methodology for calculating and modifying the PHCS thresholds. 173. The Global Payment Program Funding and Mechanics Protocol specifies the following : a. How PHCS may be defined, including criteria for when multiple DPHs may comprise a single Public Health Care System. b. Methodology for establishing and modifying annual global budgets for each PHCS. c. Technical guidance on how eligible services to the uninsured are defined, accounted for and re ported. d. Reporting schedule for PHCS to report services provided under the GPP. e. Transfer of IGTs, interim payment and final payment reconciliation mechanics and schedules. f. Methods for redistributing unused portions of annual global budgets among PHCS that e xceeded their point threshold 174. Evaluations of provider expenditures and activities under the global payment program. a. The state will conduct two evaluations of provider expenditures and activities under the global payment methodology. The first evaluation (using 24 months of data) will occur at the midpoint of the demonstration. The second will occur as part of the interim evaluation report due at the end of GPP PY 4. b. As the Global Payment Program is testing a new approach to financing care to the remai ning uninsured, the two evaluations will monitor the implementation and impact of the demonstration to inform how improvements to the GPP can be made following the expiration of the Demonstration . c. Both evaluations will examine the purpose and aggregate impact of the GPP, care provided by PHCS and patients' experience, with a focus on understanding the benefits and challenges of this innovative payment approach. d. To ensure the GPP is achieving the goals of promoting value, not volume, t he evaluations will address by each individual PHCS , at baseline and under the GPP methodology: i. The number of uninsured individuals served ii. The number and types of services provided, iii. Expenditures associated with the services provided, iv. Expenditures that the evaluators estimate were avoided or reduced due to the Global Payment Program. The ratio of the GPP funding to uninsured California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 130 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 uncompensated care cost compared to the ratio in S FY 2014 -2015 ratio of SNCP and DSH payment s to uninsured uncompensated care cost including how and why the ratio of payment to uninsured uncompensated cost has evolved compared to the prior DSH and SNCP methodologies ; v. An assess ment of the effects of the GPP on care delivery and costs . vi. In determi ning uncompensated care costs, the evaluations shall be conducted at both the 100 percent and 175 percent UCC levels to account for the recognition of cost levels specific to California in federal law set forth in section 4721(e) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (P.L. 105 -33) and in section 607 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (P.L. 106 -113). e. As part of the evaluation of the overall success of the GPP, in addition to the items above, for the second evaluation on ly, the evaluation will also examine factors to evaluate the objectives of the GPP program, including the extent to which the GPP encouraged or improved: i. Care in more appropriate settings, to ensure that patients are seen in the right place and given the right care at the right time. ii. Changes in resource allocation iii. Improvements in workforce involvement and care team transformation under the demonstration f. Both evaluations will include narrative hospital self -assessments of the successes and challenges of th e GPP. g. The evaluations are not intended to be the basis of funding changes to the Uncompensated Care Pool during the term of the demonstration . 175. Coordination with DSH a. To maintain budget neutrality, the state will not make DSH payments and uncompensated care payments to hospitals participating in the GPP that are authorized under the state plan. b. Hospitals that meet DSH eligibility criteria and which are not participatin g within a PHCS may receive DSH payments under the applicable provisions of Attachment 4.19-A of the state plan, as modified pursuant to A ttachment NN (DSH Coordination Methodology). 176. Discontinuation of GPP DHCS may, in consultation with the participating PHCS, discontinue the GPP in any subsequent state fiscal year(s) for the remainder of the Demonstration and revert to financing uncompensated care costs for Medicaid and uninsured patients under the DSH program pursuant to the state plan. DHCS shall notify CMS no later than 30 days prior to the start of the initial state fiscal year for which the GPP will be discontinued. DHCS will follow the appropriate processes as is necessary to facilitate DSH payments t o affected PHCS under the State plan. 177. DSH Payments and FFY California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 131 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The state is not authorized to make a DSH payment under the Medicaid state plan for any hospital for any federal fiscal year (FFY) in which the hospital is eligible for a GPP payment for the co rresponding GPP Program Year (PY). Each PY corresponds with the FFY that begins during the PY, except that GPP PY 1 corresponds with FFY 2016. A DSH payment is considered to be made for a FFY if the payment would count against the DSH allotment for that FFY. In the event that the GPP is not authorized for a full PY, the state is prohibited from making duplicate GPP and DSH payments to GPP -eligible hospitals and must submit, subject to CMS approval, a method for allocating GPP and DSH payments to avoid du plication during the affected period XIII. Uncompensated Care Reporting 178. Independent Report on Uncompensated Care. The following describe the requirements for two independent reports on uncompensated care. a. Description. The state must commission two reports from an independent entity on uncompensated care in the state. i. The first report, due May 15, 2016, will focus on Designated Public Hospitals . The objective of this report will be to support a determination of the appropriate level of Uncompensated Care Pool funding at those providers in years two through five of the demonstration. CMS will provide a formal determination of the funding levels for demonstration years two through five within 60 days of receipt of the complete report. ii. The second report, due June 1, 2017, will focus on uncompensated care, provider payments and financing across hospital providers that serve Medicaid beneficiaries and the uninsured under the current demonstration. The report will include information that will inform discussions about potential reforms that will improve Medicaid payment systems and funding mechanisms and the quality of health care services for California's Medicaid beneficiaries and for the uninsured. 179. The state must assure that $1,000,000 is available to complete the reports. Funding made available for the reports from non -state entities, such as foundations, would satisfy this requirement even if such funds did not flow through the state. 180. Contents of the Reports . The analysis will be completed in two separate reports . a. The First Report. The first report must review the impact of the uncompensated care pool on those providers who participate in the UC pool with respect to: i. Uncompensated care provided : The cost of uncompensated care provided to uninsured individuals, distinguishing between costs associated with charity care from those associated with bad debt, and the extent that historical pool payments have addressed these costs. ii. Medicaid provider pay ment rates; iii. Medicaid beneficiary access; and iv. Role of managed care plans in managing care. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 132 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 b. The Second Report . The second report will include the elements in subsection (a) of this STC with respect to all Medicaid hospital providers in the state, including data from the first report, and will also include a comparable examination of provider financing for those providers who serve the Medicaid population and the low -income uninsured. In addition, the second report will include: i. The role of the PRIME program for designated public hospital systems. ii. A detailed description and analysis of the current Medicaid hospital payment and financing system, with a major focus on services currently supported with pool funds; iii. The financing of overall uncompensated c are in the state and the financing of providers that play a significant role in serving the Medicaid population and the low income uninsured, and the extent to which pool funds are needed to cover uncompensated care; iv. Reporting of how uncompensated care ha s changed since implementation of the ACA expansion . v. Information to support the goal for public health care systems to become self-sustaining entities that are not reliant on pool funds beyond 2020 ; vi. Information that will inform discussions about potential reforms that will improve Medicaid payment systems and funding mechanisms and the quality of health care services for California's Medicaid beneficiaries and for the uninsured. c. Both Reports . Both reports sh ould provide the following information for the hospital providers covered in the respective reports: i. Total hospital system revenue from all payors ii. Total Medicaid revenue (including patient care revenue and all other Medicaid revenue such as demonstration r evenue and incentive payments) iii. Total Medicaid patient care revenue iv. Total safety net care pool revenue All data presented in each report must be submitted to CMS in unlocked Excel worksheets to assist in review of the analysis 2. Monitoring and Potential Re ductions a. Monthly monitoring calls with the state will include an update of progress on the report as noted in monitoring section of the STCs. b. If the state does not timely submit a final report, including all requested analyses and recommendations, the state's expenditure authority for uncompensated care pools will be reduced by $500,000. The state may seek, and CMS may grant, relief from this reduction, if needed. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 133 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 XIV. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER TITLE XIX 181. Quarterly Reports. The State will provide quarterly expenditure reports using the form CMS -64 to report total expenditures for services provided under the Medicaid program, and to separately identify expenditures provided through the California's Medi -Cal 2020 demonstration under section 1115 authority which are subject to budget neutrality. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the demon stration period. The CMS will provide FFP for allowable demonstration expenditures only as long as they do not exceed the pre -defined limits on the costs incurred as specified in Section XI (Monitoring Budget Neutrality). 182. Reporting Expenditures under th e Demonstration. In order to track expenditures under this demonstration, California will report demonstration expenditures through the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), following routine CMS -64 re porting instructions outlined in section 2500 of the State Medicaid Manual (SMM). a. All demonstration expenditures claimed under the authority of title XIX of the Act must be reported each quarter on separate CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver forms, id entified by the demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including the project number extension, which indicates the demonstration year in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made). For monitoring purposes, costs settle ments must be recorded on Line 10.b., in lieu of Lines 9 or 10.c. For any other costs settlements (i.e., those not attributable to this demonstration), the adjustments should be reported on Lines 9 and 10.c., as instructed in the SMM. The term \"expenditu res subject to the budget neutrality cap,\" is defined in STC 183. b. For each demonstration year, thirty -three (33) separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver must be completed to report expenditures for the following demonstration expenditures. The eligibility groups (EGs) and Demonstration Programs that are used for calculation of the budget neutrality limit described in STC 148 and the specific waiver names to be used to identify these separate Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver are described below .

For each Demonstration year, a separate Forms CMS -64.21U Waiver and/or 64.21UP Waiver must be completed to report expenditures for the following demonstration California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 138 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 expenditures. The specific waiver names to be used to identify these separate Forms CMS -64.21U Waiver and/or 64.21UP Waiver appear in brackets below: i. MCHIP: The CMS 64.21 -Waiver form must be completed to report expenditures for the Medicaid expansion demonstration populati on. [MCHIP] . f. Reporting member months. Reporting Member Months. The following describes the reporting of member months for demonstration populations. i. For the purpose of calculating the budget neutrality expenditure limit and for other purposes, the state must provide to CMS, as part of the Quarterly Report required under paragraph 25, the actual number of eligible member months for each of the EGs described (b) above . The state must submit a statement accompanying the Quarterly Report, which certifies the accuracy of thi s information. To permit full recognition of \"in -process\" eligibility, reported counts of member months may be subject to revision. ii. The term \"eligible member/months\" refers to the number of months in which persons are eligible to receive services. For ex ample, a person who is eligible for 3 months contributes 3 eligible member months to the total. Two individuals who are eligible for 2 months each contribute 2 eligible member months to the total, for a total of 4 eligible member/months. iii. Eligible m ember months for July through December 2015 will apply to DY 11 under Medi -Cal 2020, and not DY 10 or Bridge to Reform . 183. Expenditures Subject to the Budget Neutrality Cap. For purposes of this section, the term \"expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap\" must include all expenditures, identified in STC 195, except for those designated for exclusion (*). All expenditures that are subject to the budget neutrality cap are considered demonstration expenditures and must be reported on Forms CMS -64.9 Waiver and/or 64.9P Waiver, and CMS 64 .21 Waiver and/or 64.21P Waiver . 184. Administrative Costs . Administrative costs will not be included in the budget neutrality limit, but the State must separately track and report additional administrative costs that are directly attributable to the Demonstration on Forms 64.10 Waiver and/or 64.10P Waiver. 185. Claiming Period. All claims for expenditures subject to the budget neutrality cap (including any cost settlements) must be made within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the State made the expenditures. All claims for services during the Demonstrat ion period must be made within 2 years after the conclusion or termination of the Demonstration. During the latter 2 year period, the State must continue to identify separately net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the Demon stration on the CMS -64 waiver forms in order to properly account for these expenditures in determining budget neutrality. 186. Standard Medicaid Funding Process. The standard Medicaid funding process must be used during the Demonstration. California must est imate matchable Medicaid expenditures California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 139 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 (total computable and Federal share) subject to the budget neutrality cap and separately report these expenditures by quarter for each Federal fiscal year on Form CMS -37 for both the Medical Assistance Payments (MAP) a nd State and Local Administration Costs (ADM). CMS shall make Federal funds available based upon the State's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the State must submit the appropriate Form CMS -64 quarterly Medicaid expenditure report, showing Medicaid expenditures made in the quarter just ended. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the Form CMS -64 with Federal funding previously made available to the State, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finali zation of the grant award to the State. 187. Extent of Federal Financial Participation for the Demonstration. Subject to CMS approval of the source(s) of the non -Federal share of funding and in accordance with paragraphs 30 entitled Certified Public Expenditures CMS will provide FFP at the applicable Federal reimbursement rate as outlined below, subject to the limits described in Section XI: a. Administrat ive costs, including those associated with the administration of the California's Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration. b. Net medical assistance payments/expenditures and prior period adjustments paid in accordance with the approved State Plan. c. Expenditures associated with expenditure authorities granted for the demonstration. 188. Sources of Non -Federal Share. The state certifies that s tate and local monies are used as matching funds for the demonstration. The s tate further certifies that such f unds shall not be used a s matching funds for any other f ederal grant or contract, except as permitted by law. All sources of the non -federal share of funding must be compliant with section 1903(w) of the Act and any applicable regulations, i.e., are not derived from impermissible provider taxes or donations or f ederal funds (unless the other f ederal funding source by law allows use of federal funds for matching purposes) . Further, these sources and di stribution of monies involving f ederal match are subje ct to CMS approval. Upon re view of the sources of the non -federal share of funding and distribution methodologies, any sources deemed unacceptable by CMS shall be addressed within the time frames set by CMS. For non - federal share funding using intergover nmental transfers, the funding entity shall certify that the funds transferred quali fy for federal financial participation purs uant to 42 CFR part 433 Subpart B, and are not derived from impermissible sources such as recycled Medicaid payments, federal mon ey excluded from use as state match, impermissible taxes, and non - bona fide provider -related donations. The s tate must have permissible sources for the non - federal share of demonstration expenditures, which may include CPEs or permissible Intergovernmenta l Transfers (IGTs) from government -operated entities and state funds. Sources of non -federal funding shall not include provider taxes or donations impermissible under section 1903(w), impermissible intergovernmental transfers from providers, or federal funds received from federal programs other than Medicaid (unless expressly authorized by federal statute to be used for claiming purposes, and the federal Medicaid funding is credited to the other federal funding source). For this purpose, federal funds do no t include California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 140 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 PRIME p ayments, patient care revenue received as payment for services rendered under programs such as the Designat ed State Health Programs, Medicare, or Medicaid. 189. Monitoring the Demonstration. The State will provide CMS with information to effectively monitor the Demonstration, upon request, in a reasonable time frame. 190. Cost -Claiming. All costs will be claimed in accordance with OMB Circular A -87 as defined within Attachment F, and any other cost claiming methodologies or protocols approved by CMS under this Demonstration. XV. GENERAL FINANCIAL REQUIREMENTS UNDER TITLE XXI 191. Quarterly Expenditure Reports. The State must report State Plan and Demonstration expenditures using the Medi caid and Children's Health Insurance Program Budget and Expenditure System (MBES/CBES), following the routine CMS MBES system instructions. The State shall report on separate forms, CMS -64.21U Waiver and/or CMS -64.21UP Waiver, for Title XXI Demonstration expenditures for Medicaid Expansion children eligible for title XXI funding. This project is approved for expenditures applicable to services rendered during the Demonstration period. CMS will provide FFP only for allowable Demonstration expenditures tha t do not exceed the State's available title XXI funding. 192. Reporting Expenditures Under the Demonstration. In order to track title XXI expenditures under this Demonstration, the State will report Demonstration expenditures through the MBES/CBES, following routine CMS MBES system instructions. The State will report Title XXI Demonstration expenditures on separ ate Forms CMS -64.21U Waiver and CMS -64.21UP Waiver, identified by the Demonstration project number assigned by CMS (including project number extension, which indicates the demonstration year in which services were rendered or for which capitation payments were made). Once the appropriate waiver form is selected for reporting expenditures, the State must identify the program code and coverage. a. The State must submit all claims for expenditures related to the Demonstration (including any cost settlements) within 2 years after the calendar quarter in which the State made the expenditures. Furthermore, the State must submit all claims for services during the Demonstration period (including cost settlements) within 2 years after the conclusion or termination o f the Demonstration. During the 2 -year period, the State must continue to identify separately, on the Form CMS -64, 21, net expenditures related to dates of service during the operation of the Demonstration. b. The State will use standard MCHIP funding proce ss during the Demonstration. The State must estimate matchable MCHIP expenditures on the quarterly Form CMS -37. On a separate CMS -37, the State shall provide updated estimates of expenditures for the Medicaid Expansion Demonstration population. CMS will make Federal funds available based upon the State's estimate, as approved by CMS. Within 30 days after the end of each quarter, the State must submit the California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 141 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Form CMS -64.21 quarterly CHIP expenditure report. CMS will reconcile expenditures reported on the Form C MS-64.21 with Federal funding previously made available to the State, and include the reconciling adjustment in the finalization of the grant award to the State. c. The State will certify State/local monies used as matching funds for the Demonstration and w ill further certify that such funds will not be used as matching funds for any other Federal grant or contract, except as permitted by Federal law. 193. Limitations on Title XXI Funding. The State will be subject to a limit on the amount of Federal title XXI funding that the State may receive on Demonstration expenditures during the Demonstration period. Federal title XXI funding available for Demonstration expenditures is limited to the State's available allotment, including currently available reallocated fu nds. Should the State expend its available title XXI Federal funds for the claiming period, no further enhanced Federal matching funds will be available for costs of the approved title XXI separate child health program or Demonstration until the next allotment becomes available. a. Total Federal title XXI funds for the State's CHIP program (i.e., the approved title XXI State plan and this Demonstration) are restricted to the State's available allotment and reallocated funds. Title XXI funds (i.e., the allotm ent or reallocated funds) must first be used to fully fund costs associated with the State plan population. Demonstration expenditures are limited to remaining funds. b. Total expenditures for outreach and other reasonable costs to administer the title XXI S tate plan and the Demonstration that are applied against the State's title XXI allotment may not exceed 10 percent of total title XXI expenditures. Premium contributions under the Demonstration shall be reported to CMS on Form CMS -21 Waiver, Line 29, in order to assure that the Demonstration is properly credited with premium collections. If the state exhausts the available title XXI Federal funds in a Federal fiscal year during the period of the demonstration, the State must continue to provide coverage to the approved title XXI State plan separate child health program population and the demonstration population with State funds. XVI. MONITORING BUDGET NEUTRALITY FOR THE DEMONSTRATION 194. Budget Neutrality Effective Date. All STCs, waivers, and expenditure authorities relating to budget neutrality shall be effective beginning January 1, 2016. Notwithstanding this effective date, expenditures made by California for Safety Net Care Uncompensated Care Pool payments during the temporary extension period of November 1, 2015 through December 31, 2015 , and Medicaid service expenditures for managed care populations and California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 142 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 DSHP expenditures from July 1 to December 31, 2015, must be applied against Demonstration Year 11 (DY 11) e xpenditu res. 195. Limit on Title XIX Funding. California will be subject to a limit on the amount of Federal title XIX funding that California may receive on selected Medicaid expenditures during the period of approval of the Demonstration. The selected Medicaid exp enditures consist of the expenditures for the range of services included in the managed care contracts and used to develop the without waiver per member per month limits under the Demonstration. The limit will consist of three parts, and is determined by u sing a per capita cost method combined with an aggregate amount based on the aggregate annual diverted upper payment limit determined for designated public hospitals in California and disproportionate share hospital (DSH) allotments. Spending under the bud get neutrality limit is authorized for (1) managed care population expenditures for the following groups - family and children, dual eligibles, and SPD, (2) all spending related to approved expenditure authorities. Budget neutrality expenditure targets ar e calculated on an annual basis with a cumulative budget neutrality expenditure limit for the length of the demonstration extension (January 2016 through June 2020). Actual expenditures subject to the budget neutrality expenditure limit must be reported b y California using the procedures described in the section for General Financial Requirements Under Title XIX . The data supplied by the State to CMS to calculate the annual limits is subject to review and audit, and if found to be inaccurate, will result in a modified budget neutrality expenditure limit. CMS' assessment of the State's compliance with these annual limits will be done using the Schedule C report from the MBES/CBES system. 196. Risk. California will be at risk for the per capita cost for demons tration enrollees under this budget neutrality agreement, but not for the number of demonstration enrollees in each of the groups . By providing FFP for all demonstration enrollees, California will not be at risk for changing economic conditions which impa ct enrollment levels. However, by placing California at risk for the per capita costs for demonstration enrollees, CMS assures that the federal demonstration expenditures do not exceed the level of expenditures that would have occurred had there been no d emonstration. 197. Budget Neutrality Annual Expenditure Limit. For each DY, three annual limits are calculated. a. Limit A. For each year of the budget neutrality agreement an annual budget neutrality expenditure limit is calculated for each eligibility grou p (EG) described as follows: i. An annual EG estimate must be calculated as a product of the number of eligible member months reported by the State for that EG under the section entitled General Reporting Requirements, times the appropriate estimated per me mber per month (PMPM) costs from the table in subparagraph (iii) below. ii. Actual expenditures for the CBAS benefit will be included in the expenditure limit for the demonstration project. The amount of actual expenditures to be included will be the actual cost of providing the CBAS California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 143 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 services (whether provided through managed care or fee -for-service) to the SPD Medicaid -only population and to dual eligible. iii. Actual expenditures for the DMC -ODS benefit will be included in the expenditure limit for the demonstration project. The amount of actual expenditures to be included will be the actual cost of providing the DMC - ODS benefit to the eligible population; iv. The PMPMs for each EG used to calculate the annual budget neutrality expenditure limit for this Demonstration is specified below.

As described in paragraph (a)(ii) and (a)(iii) above, the actual expenditures for these hypothet ical populations are included in the budget neutrality limit . b. Limit B. The amount of the designated public hospital spending as determined in the chart below. The state is prohibited from changing the reimbursement methodology or amounts of supplemental payments approved in the Medicaid state plan on January 1, 201 6 that re sult in higher overall reimbursement without recalculating the Upper Payment Limit (UPL) for the period of the new or modified payments and adjusting the UPL diversion if necessary. Total Computable IP Unspent Public Hospital Amounts DY 11 $863,054,068 DY 12 $863,054,068 DY 13 $863,054,068 DY 14 $863,054,068 DY 15 $863,054,068 5 Year Total $4,315,270,34 0 c. Limit C. Annual DSH allotments for California, as determined under section 1923(f) of the Act and 42 CFR 447 Subpart E. For each DY, Limit C will be the total California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 145 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 computable equivalent of the DSH allotment for the federal fiscal year (FFY) that begins during the DY, calculated using the FMAP in effect for the largest portion of the FFY to which the DSH allotment pertains. For DY 11, Limit C will be the total computable equivalent of the DSH allotment for the FFY 2016. d. The annual budget neutrality expenditure limit for the Demonstration as a whole is the sum of limits A, B, and C . The overall budget neutrality expenditure limit for the Demonstration is the sum of the annual budget neutrality expenditure limits. The Federal share of the overall budget neutrality expenditure limit represents the maximum amount of FFP that California can receive for expenditures on behalf of demons tration populations as well as demonstration expenditure authorities under the demonstration programs (GPP, WPC, PRIME, DSHP, IHS, and DTI) described in these STCs . e. California must present to CMS for approval MCO con tract modifications to include an increase in PMPM amounts due to adjustments associated with the inpatient hospital provider tax. The with waiver and without waiver budget neutrality PMPM limits will be adjusted for each EG with an affected rate due to re quirements in the Affordable Care Act based on the increases in contracts, if necessary. f. Savings Phase -out: Each DY, the net variance between the without -waiver cost and actual with -waiver cost will be reduced for selected Medicaid population based EGs. The reduced variance, to be calculated as a percentage of the total variance, will be used in place of the total variance to determine overall budget neutrality for the demonstration. (Equivalently, the difference between the total variance and reduced variance could be subtracted from the without -waiver cost estimate.) The formula for calculating the reduced variance is, reduced variance equals total variance times applicable percentage. The percentages for each EG and DY are determined based how long t he associated population has been enrolled in managed care subject to this demonstration; lower percentages are for longer established managed care populations. The EGs affected by this provision and the applicable percentages are shown in the table below , except that if the total variance for an EG in a DY is negative, the applicable percentage is 100 percent. EG DY 11 DY 12 DY 13 DY 14 DY 15 Urban Family - TPM/GMC 23% -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 146 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 EG DY 11 DY 12 DY 13 DY 14 DY 15 Urban Family - COHS 23% section 1115(a) demonstration is considered for an amendment, renewal, and at the end of the duals demonstration, CMS' Office of the Actuary (OACT) will estimate and certify actual title XIX savings to date under the duals demonstration attributable to populations and services provided under the 1115(a) demonstration. This amount will be subtracted from the 1115(a) budget neutrality savings approved for the renewal. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 147 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Specifically, OACT will estimate and certify actual title XIX savings attributable to populations and services provided under the 1115(a) demonstration following the methodology below. The actual title XIX savings attributable to populations and services provided under the 1115(a) demonstration are equal to the savings percentage specified in the 1115A duals demonstration MOU multiplied by the 1115A demonstration capitation rate and the number of 1115A duals demonstration beneficia ries enrolled in the 11 15(a) demonstration. 1115A Demonstration capitation rate is reviewed by CMS's Medicare and Medicaid Coordination Office (MPLAN), MPLAN's contracted actuaries and CMS' Office of the Actuary (OACT), and was certified by the state's ac tuaries. Per the 1115A duals demonstration MOU, the actual Medicaid rate paid for beneficiaries enrolled in the 1115A demonstration is equivalent to the state's 1115A Medicaid capitation rate minus an established savings percentage (as outlined in the cha rt below). The state must track the number of member months for every Medicare -Medicaid enrollee (MME) who participates in both the 1115(a) and 1115A demonstration. The table below provides an illustrative example of how the savings attributable to populations and services provided under the 1115(a) demonstration is calculated A. 1115A Demonstration Year B. Medicaid Capitation Rate (hypothetical) C. Medicaid Savings Percentage Applied Per MOU (average) D. Savings Per Month (B*C) E. Member Months o f MMEs who participated in 1115A and 1115(a) Demos (estimated) F. Amount subtracted 1,000 * 40 PMPM = $40,000 In each quarterly report, the state must provide the information in the above -named chart (replacing estimated figures with actual data). Should rates differ by geographic area and/or rating category within the 1115A demonstration, this table should be do ne for each geographic area and/or rating category. In addition, the state must show the \"amount subtracted from the 1115(a) BN savings\" in the updated budget neutrality Excel worksheets that are submitted in each quarterly report. California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 148 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Finally, in each qu arterly CMS -64 submission and in each quarterly report, the state must indicate in the notes section: \"For purposes of 1115(a) demonstration budget neutrality reporting purposes, the state reports the following information: a. Number of Medicare -Medicaid enr demonstration Number of member months = [Insert number] c. PMPM savings per dual beneficiary enrolled from the 1115A duals demonstration = [Insert number] The State must make the necessary retroactive adjus tments to the budget neutrality worksheets to reflect modifications to the rates paid in the 1115A demonstration. This must include any Medicaid payment triggered by the risk corridor, IGTs, or other retroactive adjustments. The State must add additional columns to the chart above in subsequent quarterly reporting to reflect those adjustments. By December 31, 2016, California must submit to CMS a completed version of the table above, covering the period from the implementation of the 1115A duals demonstration through October 31, 2015, to support OACT estimation and certification of actual title XIX savings attributable to populations and services provided under the 1115(a) demonstration attributable to the 1115A duals demonstration. 199. Monitoring of New Adult Group Spending and Opportunity to Adjust Projections. For each DY, a separate annual budget limit for the new adult group will be calculated as the product of the trended monthly per person cost times the actual number of eligible/member months as reported to CMS by the State under the guidelines set forth in STC 182(f). The trend rates and per capita cost estimates for the new adult group are listed in the table below. MEG TREND DY 11 PMPM DY 12 DY 13 DY 14 DY 15 New Adult - COHS 3.2% $664.73 $591.38 a. If the State's experience of the take up rate for the new adult group and other factors that affect the costs of this population indicates that the new adult group PMPM limit described above may underestimate the actual costs of medical assistance for the new adult group, the State has the opportunity to submit a n adjustment to the PMPM limit, along with detailed expenditure data to justify this, for CMS review without submitting an amendment pursuant to STC 7. In order to ensure timely adjustments to the PMPM limit for a demonstration year, the revised projectio n must be submitted to CMS by no later than 11 months into the demonstration year for which the adjustment would take effect. Additional adjustments to the PMPM limit may be made pursuant to the process outlined in (d) below. b. The budget limit for the new adult group is calculated by taking the PMPM cost projection for the above group in each DY, times the number of eligible member California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 149 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 months for that group and DY, and adding the products together across DYs. The federal share of the budget neutrality cap is o btained by multiplying total computable budget neutrality cap by the federal share. c. The State will not be allowed to obtain budget neutrality \"savings\" from this population. Excess spending for the new adult group does not count against the budget neutrality limit defined in STC 197. d. If total FFP reported by the state for the new ad ult group should exceed the federal share of FFP for the budget limit for the new adult group by more than 3 percent following each demonstration year, the state will submit plan to CMS for further modifying the PMPM limit as appropriate to ensure it is co nsistent with actual PMPM expenditures for the new adult group. The plan must identify the cause of the discrepancy between the state's initial estimates and actual costs and must describe a timeline for revising the state's projections. 200. Composite Feder al Share Ratios. The Federal share of the budget neutrality expenditure limit is calculated by multiplying the limit times the Composite Federal Share Ratio. The Composite Federal Share Ratio is the ratio calculated by dividing the sum total of FFP receiv ed by California on actual Demonstration expenditures during the approval period, as reported through MBES/CBES and summarized on Schedule C with consideration of additional allowable Demonstration offsets such as, but not limited to premium collections and pharmacy rebates, by total computable Demonstration expenditures for the same period as reported on the same forms. 201. Budget Neutrality Monitoring Tool. The state and CMS will jointly develop a budget neutrality monitoring tool (using a mutually agreeable spreadsheet program) for the state to use for quarterly budget neutrality status updates and other in situations when an analysis of budget neutrality is required. The tool will incorporate the C Report for monitoring actual expenditures subject to budget neutrality. A working version of the monitoring tool will be available for the state's first Quarterly Progress Report in 2016. 202. Enforcement of Bud get Neutrality. CMS shall enforce the budget neutrality agreement over the life of the demonstration extension, which will be from November 1, 2015 through December 31 , 2020. The budget neutrality test for the demonstration extension may incorporate net savings from the immediately prior demonstration period of November 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015 (but not from any earlier approval period). To incorporate savings from the November 1, 2010 through December 31, 2015 approval period, California must p rovide CMS a certified and audited final assessment of budget neutrality for that period in which demonstration expenditures totals are consistent with the amounts reported by the state on the CMS -64 report (as summarized in the C Report). Historical info rmation about the budget neutrality test for California's 1115 demonstration appears in Attachment LL. 203. Exceeding Budget Neutrality. If the budget neutrality expenditure limit defined in STC 197 has been exceeded at the end of the demonstration extensio n period (including Savings California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 150 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Phase -Out), the excess Federal funds must be returned to CMS. If the Demonstration is terminated prior to the end of the budget neutrality agreement, the budget neutrality test shall be based on the time elapsed through the ter mination date. XVII. EVALUATION OF THE DEMONSTRATION 211. Submission of Draft Evaluation Design . The state must submit to CMS for approval, within 180 days of the approval date of the Medi -Cal 2020 demonstration and applicable attachments, a draft evaluation design for all elements of the demonstration discussed below, excluding PRIME. At a minimum, the draft design must include a discussion of the goals, objectives, and specific hypotheses, including those that focus specifically on target populations for th e demonstration, and more generally on beneficiaries, providers, plans, market areas and public expenditures, as applicable. The updated design should be described in sufficient detail to determine that it is scientifically rigorous including a thoroughl y documented data strategy. 212. Cooperation with Federal Evaluators. Should HHS undertake an evaluation of any component of the demonstration, the state shall cooperate, to the greatest extent possible, fully with CMS or the evaluator selected by HHS; in ad dition, the state shall submit the required data to HHS or its contractor. Requests from HHS for information and data shall be made in a timely manner and provide the state with an adequate timeframe to provide the information as agreed to by CMS and the s tate. 213. Evaluation Design . a. The design should describe how the evaluation and reporting will develop and be maintained to assure its scientific rigor and completion. In summary, the demonstration evaluation will meet all standards of leading academic inst itutions and academic journal peer review, as appropriate for each aspect of the evaluation, including standards for the evaluation design, conduct, interpretation, and reporting of findings. Among the characteristics of rigor that will be met are the use of best available data; controls for and reporting of the limitations of data and their effects on results; and the generalizability of results. b. The state and CMS agree that a robust evaluation is desired in order to, to the greatest extent possible, det ermine the causal impacts of the Demonstration. The state and CMS will work to identify available data sources in order to allow for this type of evaluation, including data sources that would provide the ability to use control and comparison groups, where available, as well as before -and-after studies. The design will include a description of the quantitative and qualitative study design including a rationale for the design selected. The discussion will include a proposed baseline and approach to compariso n. The discussion will include approach to benchmarking, and should consider applicability of national and state standards. The application of sensitivity analyses as appropriate shall be considered. The evaluation design must include descriptive statistic s that reflect the socioeconomic status and demographic composition of those served by the demonstration, and will consider the impact of the demonstration on socioeconomic California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 151 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 and demographic subgroups. The draft evaluation design must include a detailed analysis plan that describes how the effects of the demonstration shall be isolated from other initiatives occurring in the state. The level of analysis may be at the beneficiary, provider, health plan and program level, as appropriate, and shall include popu lation and intervention -specific stratifications, for further depth and to glean potential non - equivalent effects on different sub -groups. c. The state shall seek comment from the public on the development of its evaluation design. The submitted design mu st describe the state's process for seeking comment from the public on the evaluation approach and questions to be addressed. d. The updated design must describe the state's process to contract with an independent entity, ensuring no conflict of interest. e. The design, including the budget and adequacy of approach, is subject to CMS approval. The budget and approach must be adequate to support the scale and rigor reflected in the paragraph above. f. Measures - The draft evaluation design must discuss, for each hypothesis, as applicable, the quantitative and/or qualitative process and/or outcome measures that adequately assess the effectiveness of the demonstration in terms of cost of services and total costs of care, improved health outcomes and system transformation including better care, better quality, and enhanced value, change in delivery of care from inpatient to outpatient, quality improvement, and transformation of incentive arrangements under managed ca re.

CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURES - DETERMINATION OF ALLOWABLE COSTS FOR CCS, GHPP, MIA/LTC, BCCTP, CMSP, EAPC, ADAP, EWC, PCTP, and DDS A. General Provisions Program costs, for each program described above, mean the total expenditures incurred in the State Fiscal Year (SFY) ended June 30 from all the funding sources. Allowable DSHP expenditures will be applied against each Demonstration Year using the date of service information from each paid claim. Net program costs are program costs for health care services only. DSHP costs, for each program described above, are net program costs funded by the State and/or local funds. Allowable DSHP costs are DSHP costs for health care services which are allowable under section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act, rendered to th e uninsured population. For the purpose of interim claiming, the estimated program costs for each SFY are the budget amount of Fund Appropriation for the applicable fiscal period that the State and other funding authorities commit to each SOMP. The esti mated program cost for each fiscal period is reduced by funding for administrative activities to arrive at estimated net program cost. Estimated net program cost is reduced by budgeted funding from non - State, non -local sources to arrive at estimated DSHP cost. Estimated DSHP cost is multiplied by an interim allocation percentage to arrive at the estimated allowable SNCP cost for the fiscal period. Costs associated with providing non -emergency services to non -qualified aliens cannot be claimed against t he SNCP. To implement this limitation, 13.95 percent of total certified public expenditures for services to uninsured individuals will be treated as expended for non -emergency care to non -qualified aliens. The State will implement this requirement for the following DSHPs: CCS, GHPP, CMSP, EAPC, ADAP, EWC, PCTP, and DDS - A 13.95 percent reduction factor is applied to the total certified SNCP expenditures before costs are claimed. MIA/LTC and BCCTP - No reduction factor is applied to the total certified SNC P expenditures before costs are claimed. There are no unqualified aliens receiving services under the MIA/LTC program. Expenditures related to non -emergency services for unqualified aliens under the BCCTP will be identified and excluded by aid codes.

Department of Developmental Services (DDS) DDS is responsible under the Lanterman Develop mental Disabilities Services Act (Lanterman Act) for ensuring that more than 246,000 people with developmental Attachment F Funding and Reimbursement Protocol Determination of Allowable Costs to Uninsured Individuals in Designated State Health Programs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 165 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 disabilities receive the services and supports needed to live independent and productive lives. These disabilities include mental retardation, c erebral palsy, epilepsy, autism and related conditions. Services are delivered directly through four state -operated developmental centers and one community facility (Developmental Center Services), and under contract with a statewide network of 21 private , nonprofit regional centers (Community Based Services). The Lanterman Act establishes an entitlement to services and supports for persons with developmental disabilities and their families that are determined through an individualized planning process th at occurs after a series of discussions or interactions among a team of people including the person with a developmental disability, their family (when appropriate), regional center representative(s) and others. The Individual Program Plan (IPP) may inclu de a wide array of services such as: residential, day program and employment, independent and supported living, transportation, behavioral, respite and other family supports, and case management/service coordination. Regional centers are payers of last res ort, requiring consumers to access generic resources when available to meet their individual needs. *Eligibility A person with a developmental disability that originates before an individual attains age 18 years, continues, or can be expected to continu e, indefinitely, and constitutes a substantial disability for that individual, as defined in California Welfare and Institutions Code (W&I Code) Section 4512. A developmental disability includes mental retardation, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, autism, and disabling conditions found to be closely related to mental retardation or to require treatment similar to that required for individuals with mental retardation. It does not include conditions that are solely physical in nature. Infants and toddlers (age 0 to 36 months) who have a developmental delay (defined in Section 95014 of CA Government Code) also receive services from DDS. *Funding Sources/Flows DDS Community -Based Services are funded by the following funding sources: State Funds: State General Fun d Mental Health Services Fund California Children and Family Trust Fund (Proposition 10 funding to create a comprehensive and integrated system of information and services to promote early childhood development (from prenatal to age 5) and school readiness, including community health care, quality child care, and education programs for young children) Federal Funds: Attachment F Funding and Reimbursement Protocol Determination of Allowable Costs to Uninsured Individuals in Designated State Health Programs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 166 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Medicaid (e.g. Home and Community Based Services Waiver (HCBS), Medicaid Administration, Targeted Case Management, 1915(i) State Plan Amendment, and Money Follows the Person Grant) Title XX Block Grant (no State match or MOE is required) Early Start Program Grant for infants and toddlers age 0 to 36 months Foster Grandparents Program (administrative funding supports the volunteer progra m that establishes person -to-person relationship between low income senior, age 55 years or older, and children with intellectual disabilities) Homeland Security Grant (funding to regional centers for equipment, training, and exercise to prevent, respond t o, and recover from acts of terrorism and other catastrophic events) Others: Program Development Fund (fees assessed to parents of children under the age of 18 who receive 24 -hour out -of-home services purchased with State funds through a regional center) Vocational Rehabilitation (funding by HCBS and GF for transportation expenditures) Developmental Disabilities Services Account (application fees paid by housing developers to reimburse DDS' costs for review and approval of the housing proposals) The ab ove represents all funding received by DDS for community -based services.

C. DSHP Interim Claiming The purpose of DSHP interim claiming is to provide an interim payment that will approximate the allowable cost s for Medicaid -like services in SOMPs that are eligible for FFP through the CPE process. For each demonstration year, the process of determining the allowable costs eligible for FFP begins with the use of most recently completed Paid Claims Data reports f or CCS, GHPP, MIA/LTC, BCCTP, CMSP, EAPC, ADAP, EWC, PCTP, and DDS. The fiscal year covered by the most recently completed Paid Claims Data reports will serve as the prior period. The net program costs, for each program described above, will be determine d by using the most recently completed Paid Claims Data report provided by its governing agency. The costs from the Paid Claims Data report represent net program costs incurred by the governing agency for medical services and are net of any self -payment or copayments made by or on behalf of the patients. Attachment F Funding and Reimbursement Protocol Determination of Allowable Costs to Uninsured Individuals in Designated State Health Programs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 168 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Net program costs are reduced by other funding and subsidies made by a federal government, MOE and other matching requirements, or other third party to the program costs to arrive at the computed DSHP costs. DSHP costs are further reduced by any program costs incurred for payments made for non-Medicaid -equivalent services or payments for services furnished to any individuals who are otherwise insured. The result is the allowable DSHP costs. An in terim allocation percentage is computed by dividing the allowable SNCP costs for each fiscal year by the total DSHP costs from Step 3 computed above. SFYs 2010 -2011 to 2015 -2016 DSHP costs will be computed pursuant to the step 3, except for interim claiming purposes, the DSHP costs will be based on budgeted appropriations and funding amounts rather than actual paid claims reports. Interim certified public expenditures of the DSHPs will be equal to the amounts of SFYs 2010 -11 to 2015 -2016 DSHP costs in Step 6 multiplied by the interim allocation percentage for the applicable fiscal period computed in step 5 and reduced by 13.95 percent as described in subsection A to account for non -emergency care furnished to non-qualified aliens. SNCP interim claiming for the federal reimbursement will be made quarterly based on the interim certified public expenditures as computed above. D. Final Reconciliation of DSHP Interim Claiming The DSHP interim certified public expenditures will be reconciled based o n the actual Paid Claims Data for the applicable fiscal periods as finalized by its governing agencies for each program. Allowable SNCP costs for each SFY will be computed pursuant to the steps described in subsection C.1 through C.5 above, using actual paid claims reports and actual funding and expenditure amounts for each SFY. The State will adjust, as necessary, the aggregate amount of interim SNCP funds claimed based on the total certified DSHP expenditures determined under this final reconciliation. If, at the end of the final reconciliation process, it is determined that SNCP funding was over -claimed, the overpayment will be properly credited to the federal government. II. CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURES - DETERMINATION OF ALLOWABLE COSTS FOR CMHS A. Cost Finding Methodology Attachment F Funding and Reimbursement Protocol Determination of Allowable Costs to Uninsured Individuals in Designated State Health Programs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 169 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 California counties, which receive federal and state funds for providing public mental health services, are required to submit a fiscal year -end (July to June) Mental Health Cost Report with the Department of Mental Health (DMH) by December 31 following the close of each fiscal year. The cost report forms, cost determination, and allocation methodologies are approved by the State and in compliance with the Federal Medicaid regulations. County total mental health costs are report ed in four primary groups of service categories: Administrative Costs. Research & Evaluation Costs. Utilization Review Costs. Direct Service Costs. The eligible SNCP costs are direct service costs funded by the State Realignment Funds and Mental Health Se rvices Act (MHSA) Fund incurred by each county for the furnishing of mental health services allowable under Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act to uninsured individuals. The allowable SNCP costs, computed under this Supplement, are limited to the e ligible SNCP costs incurred for months of DYs. Allowable SNCP costs claimable under this Supplement should not include any uninsured mental health costs incurred by counties which operate Designated Public Hospitals (DPHs); such uninsured costs are separa tely addressed in Attachment F - Supplement 4. Costs associated with providing non -emergency services to non -qualified aliens cannot be claimed against the SNCP. A 13.95 percent reduction factor is applied to the total certified SNCP expenditures before costs are claimed. B. Summary of Mental Health Cost Report The Mental Health Cost Report includes : Detail Cost Report: Detail forms for each legal entity, including county and contract providers. Summary Cost Report: Aggregate county mental health costs for the Fiscal Year. Legal entity means each county mental health department or agency and each private provider furnishing public mental health services under contract with the county department or agency.

MS describes a classification of service types. SF identifies the specific type of service received under a MS. Allowable SNCP costs are captured by the following MS and SF (which represent specialty mental health services that would be covered by Medi -Cal if furnished to Medi - Cal recipients): 05 (Hospital Inpatient and other 24 Hour Services) SF 10 -18: Local Hospital Inpatient SF 19: Hospital Administrative Days SF 20 -29: Psychiatric Health Facility SF 40 -49: Adult Crisis Residential SF 65 -79: Adult Residential 10 (Less than 24 Hour Day Treatment Program Services) SF 20 -29: Crisis Stabilization SF 81 -89: Day Treatment Intensive SF 91 -99: Day Rehabilitation 15 (Outpatient Services) All SFs. The above MS and SF do not include any service that is subject to the Institutions for Mental Diseases (IMDs) exclusion per Section 1905(a) of the Social Security Act. MH 1901 Schedule B (Worksheet for Units of Service and Revenue by Mode & Service Function The individual legal entity's worksheet for units of service by MS and SF codes under the following categories Medi -Cal Units: Regular Medi -Cal Medicare/Medi -Cal Crossover Enhanced Medi -Cal (Children and Refugees) Healthy Families Non Medi -Cal Units MH 1901 S chedule C (Allocated costs to Mode of Service & Service Function) The individual legal entity's supporting documentation to distribute the direct service costs to MS and SF.

MH 1992 (Funding Sources) The individual legal entity's total mental health costs by funding sources and service categories. MH 1992 SUM (Summary Funding Sources) The county total mental health costs (from all reporting legal entities) by funding sources and service categories. C. DSHP Interim Claiming The process of determining the allowable SNCP costs eligible for FFP begins with the use of most recently filed Mental Health Cost Report. The period covered by this most recently filed cost report will serve as the base period for interim payment computation. Cost per unit for each SF will be computed by using the total direct service costs from MH 1901 Schedule C divided by the total units of service from MH 1901 Schedule B. Non Medi -Cal units of service form MH 1901 Schedule B will be reduced, using additional auditable county and provider records, to determine the uninsured units of service. Cost per unit will be multiplied by the number of uninsured units of service comp uted above for each eligible SF to determine the total uninsured costs. If a legal entity has a contract with the county limiting its cost per unit and the contracted cost per unit is lower than the cost per unit computed in the cost report, the lower con tracted cost per unit will be used to determine the total uninsured costs for the legal entity. The total uninsured costs computed above can be trended to current year based on Consumer Price Index (CPI) for U.S City Average by commodity for Hospital and related services. In order to identify the total uninsured costs funded by the State Realignment Funds and the MHSA Fund, the State will compute the allocation percentage based on funding sources for each direct service MS. By using the Summary Cost Rep ort, MH 1992 SUM, the Realignment Funds and MHSA Funds for each direct service MS will be adjusted to exclude the matching funds used for Short -Doyle/Medi -Cal and Healthy Families FFP. Attachment F Funding and Reimbursement Protocol Determination of Allowable Costs to Uninsured Individuals in Designated State Health Programs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 172 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The allocation percentage for each direct service MS is the ratio of d irect service costs funded by the net State Realignment Funds and MHSA Funds computed above to the total direct service costs from all funding sources. The eligible SNCP costs will be the total trended uninsured costs for each MS computed in step 3 multi plied by the applicable allocation percentage. Uninsured mental health costs claimable under this Supplement do not include uninsured mental health costs incurred by counties which operate DPHs; those costs are addressed in Attachment F - Supplement 4. F urthermore, any county uninsured mental health costs incurred for other SNCP claiming, , such as the Medicaid Coverage Expansion and the Health Care Coverage Initiative, will be offset against the computed eligible SNCP costs. The net eligible SNCP costs will be multiplied by the following ratio to determine the allowable SNCP costs: SFY 2010 -11: 67.67% (8 months over 12 months) SFYs 2011 -12 to 2014 -15: 100% SFY 2015 -16: 33.33% (4 months over 12 months) Interim certified public expenditures f or CMHS are the allowable SNCP costs computed above reduced by 13.95 percent to account for non -emergency care furnished to non - qualified aliens. DSHP interim claiming for federal reimbursement will be made quarterly based on the interim certified public expenditures as computed above. D. Interim and Final Reconciliations of DSHP Interim Claiming The interim certified public expenditures for CMHS will be first reconciled based on the Mental Health Cost Reports for the applicable fiscal years accepted by DMH. The interim certified public expenditures for CMHS will also be subsequently reconciled based on Mental Health Cost Reports for the applicable fiscal years as settled and audited by DMH. Allowable SNCP costs for each SFY will be computed pursuant to the steps described in subsection C, except that the cost report for the applicable SFYs will be used to determine actual expenditures incurred. For DY 10, allowable SNCP costs for the partial period of July 1, 2015 through October 31, 2015 will be compu ted pursuant to the steps described in subsection C, except that the cost report for the SFY 2015 -2016 will be used to determine actual expenditures incurred. Attachment F Funding and Reimbursement Protocol Determination of Allowable Costs to Uninsured Individuals in Designated State Health Programs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 173 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 If legal entities costs are not fully reimbursed by the county, such as the application of legal entity contract limits, thereby reducing actual expenditures incurred by the county below legal entity costs, such reduction must be proportionately applied to the allowable SNCP costs. The State will adjust, as necessary, the aggregate amount of interi m SNCP funds claimed based on the total certified SNCP expenditures determined under this final reconciliation. If, at the end of the final reconciliation process, it is determined that SNCP funding was over -claimed, the overpayment will be properly credi ted to the federal government. Any prospective revision to the Medi -Cal mental health cost reports, as approved by CMS, must be incorporated into the mental health cost reporting methodology used in this CPE protocol. Attachment F - Supplement 1 Funding and Reimbursement Protocol for Determination of Allowable Costs to Workforce Development Programs in Designated State Health Programs California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 174 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The Special Terms and Conditions (STCs) for California's Bridge to Reform section 1115(a) Medicaid Demonstration, approved by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) on November 2, 2010, allow the State to use allowable costs in Designated State Health Programs (DSHPs) incurred from November 1, 201 5 through December 31, 20 20 for federal claiming against the Safety Net Care Pool (SNCP). DSHPs, as described under this Supplement, have two components, State Only Medical Programs (SOMPs) and Workforce Development Programs (WDPs). WDPs are integral to the successful transition to the era of health ca re reform. They improve access to healthcare in underserved areas of CA by providing scholarship, loan repayments, and programs to health professional students and graduates who are dedicated to providing direct patient care in those areas. WDPs also pro vide educational opportunities in health professional training through established state educational institutions and state department programs. WDPs include the following state/local funded programs: Office of Statewide Health Planning & Development (OSHP D) o Song -Brown Healthcare Workforce Training Program (Song -Brown) o Steven M. Thompson Physician Corps Loan Repayment Program (STLRP) o Mental Health Loan Assumption Program (MHLAP) The allowable costs incurred in the WDPs for claiming against the SNCP are the State program expenditures incurred in the months of Demonstration Year (DY) per the STCs. To determine allowable SNCP costs and the associated SNCP reimbursement when such costs are incurred by the State as certified public expenditures (CPEs), the following steps must be taken to ensure federal financial participation (FFP): I. CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURES - DETERMINATION OF ALLOWABLE COSTS FOR OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING & DEVELOPMENT A.

The estimated program cost for each fiscal period is reduced by budgeted funding for State operation costs and from non -State, non -local sources to arrive at the estimated net program cost. The estimated net program cost is multipl ied by an interim allocation percentage to arrive at the estimated allowable SNCP cost for the fiscal period. B. Program Description Song -Brown Healthcare Workforce Training Program The Song -Brown Health Care Workforce Training Act (Song -Brown Program), established in 1973, provides financial support to various healthcare education programs with an emphasis on primary care and encourages primary care health professionals to provide healthcare in medically underserved areas. *Eligibility The Song -Brown Pr ogram provides award funding to institutions (not individual students) that provide clinical training for Family Practice Residents, Family Nurse Practitioners, Physician Assistants, and Registered Nurses in rural and urban undeserved areas. The awards ar e utilized by the residence programs to develop curriculum, clinical training sites and other necessary expenses to increase the number of health professional training slots in established medical schools. The program encourages universities and primary c are health professionals to provide healthcare in medically underserved areas, and provides financial support to family practice residency, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, and registered nurse education programs through CA. It does not help cover resident tuition. *Funding Source The Song -Brown Program is currently funded by the California Health Data and Planning Fund (CHDPF), a special fee charged to CA licensed health facilities, and the State General Fund (GF). The State pays the program cla ims. *Report Format Song -Brown Program costs will be compiled from the State CalSTARS system, which uses Object of Expenditure Codes, Program Cost Account (PCA), and Category to identify the actual State expenditures for award payments.

DSHP Interim Claiming The purpose of DSHP interim claiming is to provide an interim payment that will approximate the allowable costs in OSHPD programs that are eligible for FFP through the CPE process. 1. The process of determining the allowable costs eligible for FFP begins with the use of annual budget amount of Funding Appropriation for each OSHPD program described above. 2. The estimated program costs are reduced by program operation costs and other funding and subsidies made by a federal government or other third party to arrive at the net program costs. For the OSHPD Workforce Development Programs, there is no funding other than State funding. Therefore, program operation costs are the only funding re duction needed to arrive at net program costs. 3. The net program costs for each SFY will be multiplied by the following interim allocation percentage to determine the allowable SNCP costs: SFY 2010 -11: 67.67% (8 months over 12 months) SFYs 2011 -12 to 20 14-15: 100% SFY 2015 -16: 33.33% (4 months over 12 months) 4. DSHP Interim certified public expenditures for OSHPD programs are the allowable SNCP costs as computed above. 5. SNCP interim claiming for the federal reimbursement will be made quarterly based on the interim certified public expenditures as computed above. D. Final Reconciliation of DSHP Interim Claiming The DSHP interim certified public expenditures will be reconciled based on the actual expenditures data for the applicable fiscal periods as finalized by its governing agencies for each program. Allowable SNCP costs are the net program costs paid in the months of each DY, using actual expenditures reports for each SFY. The State will adjust, as necessary, the aggregate amount of interim SNCP funds claimed based on the total certified DSHP expenditures determined under this final reconciliation. If, at the end of the final reconciliation process, it is determined that SNCP funding was over -claimed, the overpayment will be properly credited to the federal government.

Reference source not found. .b.iii. Using the methodology escribed below in section (A), the state shall make supplemental payments to Indian Health Service (IHS) and tribal facilities to account for the uncompensated costs of furnishing primary care services between April 5, 2013 and December 31, 2013 to uninsured individuals with incomes up to 133 percent of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) who are not enrolled in a Low Income Health Program (LIHP). Using the methodo logy described below in section (A) and (B), the state shall also make supplemental payments to account for the uncompensated costs of furnishing services between April 5, 2013 and December 31, 2014 to individuals enrolled in the Medi -Cal program for benef its that were eliminated from the state plan pursuant to state plan amendment 09 -001 and are not covered by Medi -Cal. Costs for optional dental and psychology, that were eliminated through SPA 09 -001, but have been added back in through State Plan Amendmen ts are not available for reimbursement through these supplemental payments. A. Provider Claiming Methodology for services provided Novemeber 1, 201 5 through December 31, 2020 1. Participating IHS and tribal 638 facilities shall enter into a billing agent agreement with the California Rural Indian Health Board (CRIHB) consistent with the requirements of 42 C.F.R. 447.10. 2. Participating facilities shall track qualifying uncompensated encounters by utilizing a tracking document or other electronic means to r ecord the following: a. The qualifying Medi -Cal service provided to a Medi -Cal beneficiary; b. Whether the service was provided to an IHS eligible individual; and e. The service date. 3. Qualifying encounters shall not include encounters for which any pay ment was made under Medi -Cal at the IHS published rate. 4. Participating IHS and tribal 638 facilities shall submit to CRIHB, on a quarterly basis, the number of qualifying uncompensated encounters, broken down by status of individual as IHS -eligible (Indian or Alaskan Native). 5. Participating IHS and tribal 638 facilities shall submit to CRIHB, on a quarterly basis, the amount of third party payments received for Medi -Cal beneficiaries for qualifying uncompensated care. Third party payments received after t he end of the quarter shall be reported as a prior period adjustment. 6. CRIHB will process the reports from participating IHS and tribal facilities and submit to DHCS, within 60 working days after the end of each quarter, a Quarterly Summary Aggregate Encoun ter Report (Exhibit 1.B) specifying the number of qualifying uncompensated encounters for each IHS/Tribal 638 facility, Attachment F - Supplement 2 Funding and Reimbursement Protocol for Claiming IHS and 638 Facilities Uncompensated Care Payment Methodology California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 179 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 broken down as reported by each facility. The submission will also include a summary page totaling the aggregate qualifying uncompensate d encounters as well as the aggregate supplemental payments due based on the applicable IHS encounter rate offset by any third party payments received by each facility for the qualifying uncompensated encounters. 7. In support of the Quarterly Aggregate Enco unter Rate, CRIHB shall submit a certification, signed by the Executive Director of CRIHB that the information contained therein is current, complete, and accurate. State Payment Process 1. The state shall make supplemental payments to each participating f acility through CRIHB within 30 days of receipt of each quarterly report, based on the reported uncompensated care costs as calculated by multiplying qualifying uncompensated encounters by the appropriate IHS published rate, offset by any third party payme nts received by each IHS/Tribal 638 facility for uncompensated encounters involving Medi -Cal beneficiaries, including third party payments reported as a prior period adjustment. If third party payments are reported as a prior period adjustment after the s upplemental payment period, the state will offset other Medi -Cal payments to the facility by the amount of such payments. 2. The state shall terminate supplemental payments if the cap for the SNCP is met. 3. The CRIHB must maintain, and upon request provide DHCS, documentation sufficient to support the claims for supplemental payments. 4. CRIHB will disburse the supplemental payments received from the state to each IHS facility in accordance with its agreement with each facility, but no later than 20 business da ys after receipt from the state. 5. The State may claim federal matching funding for supplemental payments to IHS and tribal 638 at the 100 percent FMAP rate only to the extent that the supplemental payments reflect uncompensated care furnished to IHS eligibl e individuals. .

The Safety Net Financing Division's (SNFD) Hospital Contracts Unit (HCU), within the Inpatient Contract and Monitoring Section (ICMS), is responsible for preparing quarterly and annual reconciliation of program expenditures. I. STATE -ONLY PROGRAMS - Reserved for State submission of accounting procedures for DY 6 -10 DSHPs per paragraph 22. II. CERTIFIED PUBLIC EXPENDITURES CPEs are expenditures certified by counties, university teaching hospitals, or other governmental entities within a state, as having been spent on the provision of covered services to Medi -Cal beneficiaries and uninsured individuals. CPEs are eligible for reimbursement at the federal medical assistance percentage in effect on the date the service is provided. Cost Submission At least annually, designated public hospitals (DPHs) send to SNFD an estimate of their CPEs for the project (current) year, accompanied by an attestation of the costs. The CPEs are derived from the Medi -Cal 2552 -96 cost report, a Workbook developed by SNFD, and other documentation to support the estimated CPEs. These CPEs are used to establish an interim per diem rate of reimbursement for the costs of providing inpatient care to Medi -Cal beneficiaries, and to determine DSH payments, and payments from the SNCP. In addition, the data is used as the basis of a tentative settlement made for inpatient services rendered to Medi -Cal beneficiaries. 1. Review Process SNFD reviews all data submitted for accuracy and compliance with established procedures, a nd performs tests for reasonableness. If discrepancies or inconsistencies are identified, SNFD works directly with the DPH staff to resolve issues and correct data. 2. Interim Payment Process Establish Inpatient Interim Rates SNFD establishes the in patient interim rate for each DPH based on the most current filed Medi -Cal 2552 -96 and Workbook. SNFD instructs Provider Enrollment Division (PED) to update the Provider Master File (PMF) to reflect the new interim rates. The new interim rates are not re troactive and are applied to all claims for services rendered effective with the update. Attachment H Accounting Procedure s California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 184 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Determine Interim Payment SNFD reviews the most current filed Medi -Cal 2552 -96 cost rep ort and Workbook filed by each DPH for the purpose of determi ning a tentative settlement. The tentative settlement is made to settle on an interim basis all claims paid to date to reflect the difference between the interim rate paid and actual costs. The actual claims paid are based on the most current Medi -Cal cl aims payment data generated by California's fiscal intermediary. Based on the review and application of the current payment data, SNFD generates a notice of tentative settlement to each DPH that includes schedules supporting the calculation and a copy of the payment data. A copy of the notice is forwarded to A&I for preparation of an action notice authorizing California's fiscal intermediary to pay or recover the tentative settlement amount. California's fiscal intermediary will prepare a Statement of Ac count Status which will inform the hospital of the date of payment or instructions for repayment. 3. Final Reconciliation Process The final audit report of the Medi -Cal 2552 -96 cost report generated by A&I will be used as the basis for final determin ation and settlement of the CPEs. SNFD will instruct A&I to prepare an action notice informing California's fiscal intermediary of the final settlement. California's fiscal intermediary will issue a Statement of Account Status which will incorporate the previous tentative settlement and inform the DPH of any further payment or recovery. III. INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS (IGTs) IGTs are transfers of public funds between governmental entities, such as from a county to the State. One source of the funding used for the transfer is local tax dollars. SNFD reviews the source of funding for each IGT that is proposed by a governmental entity to ensure that it meets state and federal requirements for permissible transfers. Pre-Transfer For IGTs used as the non -federal share of DSH payments, DHCS and the State Treasurer's Office (STO) are notified by the county or governmental entity, prior to the transfer of funds to ensure all arrangements are complete. For IGTs used as the non -federa l share of the supplemental payments under the provisions of section 14166.12 of the California Welfare and Institutions (W&I) Code, DHCS, the California Medical Assistance Commission (CMAC), and STO are notified by the county, or governmental entity, prio r to the transfer of funds to assure that all arrangements are complete. Transfer 1. IGTs used as the non -federal share of DSH payments. Attachment H Accounting Procedure s California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 185 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The amounts of the IGTs are determined by the data submitted to DHCS by the DPHs. Staff of the DSH Payment Unit wi ll coordinate the amount and timing of transfers from the DPHs to STO. 2. IGTs used as the non -federal share of the supplemental payments. CMAC coordinates with HCU on the amount and timing of IGTs to the STO under the provisions of section 14166.12 of the W&I Code. Post -Transfer For all IGTs, the county, or governmental entity, notifies DHCS after the transfer is complete. The transfer is verified and documented, and DHCS deposits the transferred amount into the appropriate funds for payments. IV. SAFETY NET CARE POOL PAYMENTS DPHs receive SNCP payments for hospital and clinic costs associated with health care services provided to uninsured individuals. Payment Processes The SNFD Program payment computation includes automated verification that the federal SNCP allotment, quarterly interim payments and the total SNCP funding level are not exceeded. The payment process includes three phases. Phase One Four quarterly interim payments are disbursed to hospitals during and immediat ely after the program year. Phase Two Interim reconciliation occurs based on hospital cost reports filed five months after the end of the fiscal year. Appropriate adjustments are made to either distribute an additional payment to a hospital or recove r an overpayment amount. Phase Three The final reconciliation is based on audited hospital cost reports. Appropriate adjustments are made to either distribute an additional payment to a hospital or recover an overpayment amount. HCU prepares a payment package for signatures. The package is reviewed by a peer for verification prior to routing to management for signatures. Each package includes: Attachment H Accounting Procedure s California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 186 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 (i) A memorandum addressed to the Financial Management Branch Chief requesting authorization for payment. (ii) An invoice for the signatures of the Chiefs of ICMS and HCU. (iii) A copy of the support documents. After internal signatures are obtained, HCU will: (i) Make a photocopy of payment package for program files. (ii) Record data on an internal spreadsheet, (including amount, date paid and annual totals). The payment packages are submitted to Accounting. Accounting processes the payment request and submits it to SCO. After the payment is made, Accounting will send a claim schedule to HCU for c onfirmation. V. DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE HOSPITAL PROGRAM DHCS disburses $1.0325 billion of the federal DSH allotment to eligible DPHs and non - designated public hospitals (NDPHs) annually. Hospitals that satisfy federal criteria specified in the Social Security Act and determined by the California Medicaid State Plan (State Plan), are eligible to receive DSH program funding. The State Plan defines DPHs and NDPHs, specifies the funding level, and describes the distribution methodology. The non -federal share of DSH payments to DPHs is comprised of CPEs and IGTs. DPHs use CPEs to claim DSH funding for up to 100 percent of their uncompensated care costs, and use IGTs to claim DSH funding for up to 175 percent of their uncompensated care costs, as permitte d by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. By contract, the nonfederal share of DSH payments to NDPHs is the State General Fund. Annually, the DSH Share Hospital Eligibility Unit submits a DSH Program audit report to CMS as required by the Socia l Security Act. The DSH Share Hospital Payment Unit (DSHPU) performs a final reconciliation of total DSH hospital -specific payments to ensure that funding provided during and after the project year does not exceed appropriate funding levels established by actual hospital uncompensated care costs, as required by the State Plan. The DSH Program payment computations include automated verification that the federal DSH allotment, appropriate IGT funds invoiced for DSH payments, and the total DSH Program fundin g level are not exceeded. The DSHPU protocol and procedures include quality audits to ensure that correct data is used appropriately and that correct amounts are disbursed to the appropriate hospitals. Attachment H Accounting Procedure s California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 187 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 A. DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS Check Write Memor andum The DSHPU generates a check write memorandum addressed to California's fiscal intermediary. The check write memorandum specifies the funding period, the payment amount, and the funding source. The check write memorandum includes a payment authorization notice (PAN) and a memorandum to Accounting. The DSHPU uses a unique PAN sequence number to identify each payment transaction. For payments using IGTs as the non -federal share of the payments, the PAN provides Accounting with authorization to use the federal DSH allotment and IGT funds from the Medicaid Inpatient Adjustment Fund. The memorandum provides instructions for Accounting to draw federal funds using the appropriate non -federal share sources. Signature Authorization The DSH Progr am signature authorization document includes the DSHPU Chief and the DSH Financing & Non -Contract Hospital Recoupment Section Chief. Payment Process The payment process for DPHs includes three phases. Phase One Four quarterly interim payments are disbur sed to hospitals during and immediately after the program year. Phase Two Interim reconciliation is based on hospital cost reports filed five months after the end of the fiscal year. Appropriate adjustments are made to either distribute an additional payment to a hospital or recover an overpayment amount. Phase Three The final reconciliation is based on audited hospital cost reports. Appropriate adjustments are made to either distribute an additional payment to a hospital or recover an overpayment a mount. EDS prepares the check write computer file for submission to SCO. B. NON -DESIGNATED PUBLIC HOSPITALS Check Write Memorandum Attachment H Accounting Procedure s California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 188 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The DSHPU generates a check write memorandum addressed to California's fiscal intermediary. The check write memorandum specifies the funding period, the payment amount, and the funding source (50% General Fund and 50% federal DSH allotment). The check write memorandum includes a PAN and a memorandum to Accounting. The DSHPU uses a unique PAN sequence number to identify each payment transaction. The PAN provides Accounting with authorization to use the General Fund and federal DSH allotment. The memo randum provid es instructions for Accounting to draw federal funds using the appropriate non -federal share sources. Signature Authorization The DSH Program signature authorization document includes the DSHPU Chief and the DSH Financing & Non -Contract Hosp ital Recoupment Section Chief. Payment Process The payment process for NDPHs includes two phases. Phase One During the first phase, interim payments are disbursed to hospitals during and immediately after the program year. Bimonthly payments are ma de based on tentative data. The first payment of the year is based on the prior year's data. As more current data becomes available, a recalculation is made and payments are adjusted based on current information. Phase Two Before the final payment is m ade, hospitals are given the opportunity to review the data used to calculate payment amounts. Final adjustments to payments are made in this phase after all discrepancies have been resolved. Appropriate adjustments are made to either distribute the fina l installment or recover any overpayment amounts. EDS prepares the check write computer file for submission to SCO. C. PRIVATE HOSPITALS DHCS disburses approximately $465 million of DSH replacement funding to eligible private hospitals annually. Hospitals that satisfy federal criteria specified in the Social Security Act and determined by the State Plan, are eligible to receive DSH replacement funding. The State Plan defines private hospitals, specifies the funding level, and describes the funding distribution methodology. In addition to the DSH replacement funding, DSH -eligible private hospitals receive their pro rata share of payments from a defined pool within the annual DSH allotment.

The payment packages are submitted to Accounting. Accounting processes the payment request, and submits it to SCO. After the payment is made, Accounting will send a claim schedule to HCU fo r confirmation. IX. CONSTRUCTION/RENOVATION REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM (SB 1732) In 1989, Senate Bill (SB) 1732 was enacted to establish the Construction/Renovation Reimbursement Program (also known as the SB 1732 program) (Welfare and Institutions Code 14085.5). Under this program, reimbursement is provided to eligible hospitals for the debt service costs incurred on revenue bonds used to finance eligible hospital construction project(s). Invoice Submission Invoices are submitted by participating hosp itals to HCU no more than twice each year. The invoices consist of the following: (i) A cover letter from the hospital's Chief Financial Officer, or other appropriate representative. (ii) A reimbursement request that includes bond debt service payment (principal and/or interest). (iii) Support documents verifying payment by the hospital to the debt holder. Review Process HCU verifies inclusion and accuracy of all required documents in the invoice package. Payment Process HCU calculates reimbursement amounts on a spreadsheet by: (i) Determining the amount of debt service paid. (ii) Deducting interest earned in the hospital's SB 1732 account. (iii) Calculating the reimbursable amount based on the eligible portion of the construction project and the Medi -Cal Utilization Rate percentage. HCU prepares a reimbursement payment package, which is reviewed and approved by the ICMS Chief, and submits it to Cal ifornia's fiscal intermediary. HCU sends a notification letter to each eligible hospital and a cop y of the notification letter is forwarded to CMAC. Attachment H Accounting Procedure s California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 193 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 California's fiscal intermediary forwards payment requests to SCO and sends copies of the payment requests to HCU. SCO mails the payment to the hospital. X. SELECTIVE PROVIDER CONTRACTING PROGRAM The SPCP was established in 1982 and operated under a two -year section 1915(b) waiver until August 31, 2005. On September 1, 2005, CMS approved the continuation of a restructured SPCP under California's new five -year section 1115 Medi -Cal Hospital/Uninsured C are Demonstration. The SPCP allows DHCS to selectively contract with acute care hospitals to provide inpatient hospital care to Medi -Cal beneficiaries. Under the SPCP, CMAC negotiates contract terms and conditions and per diem rates with participating ho spitals on behalf of DHCS. This program has resulted in millions of dollars of savings each year which offset expenditures in this Demonstration to assist in achieving budget neutrality. The non -federal share of SPCP payments is funded by amounts from the State General Fund. Contract Process CMAC forwards proposed contract(s)/amendment(s) to HCU for review. After review, final proposed contracts/amendments are presented at a CMAC meeting for approval by the Commissioners. The approved contracts/amen dments are signed by authorized hospital representatives and submitted by CMAC to HCU for processing. The HCU analyst prepares contract/amendment packages for processing and obtains the signature of DHCS's delegated Contract Officer (SNFD Chief) to fully execute the contracts/amendments. Notification Process HCU notifies PED of new per diem rates and/or new Current Procedural Terminology codes, revenue codes, and Health Care Procedure Coding System codes, to update the Provider Master File with the hospital - specific information. This file is used by California's fiscal intermediary to process and pay claims submitted by all Medi -Cal providers, including those participating in the SPCP. Distribution Process HCU distributes fully executed contract s/amendments to the following: (i) Contracted hospital (ii) CMAC Executive Director (iii) Medi -Cal Field Office (iv) A&I Attachment H Accounting Procedure s California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 194 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 i.

Attachment X Drug Medi -Cal Organiz ed Delivery System (DMC -ODS) Operational Protocol California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 265 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 A primary goal underlying the ASAM Criteria is for the patient to be placed in the most appropriate level of care. For both clinical and financial reasons, the preferable level o f care is that which is the least intensive while still meeting treatment objectives and providing safety and security for the patient. The ASAM Criteria is a single, common standard for assessing patient needs, optimizing placement, determining medical necessity, and documenting the appropriateness of reimbursement. ASAM Criteria uses six unique dimensions, which represent different life areas that together impact any and all assessment, service planning, and level of care placement decisions. The ASAM Criteria structures multidimensional assessment around six dimensions to provide a common language of holistic, biopsychosocial assessment and treatment across addiction treatment, physical health and mental health services. The ASAM Criteria provides a c onsensus based model of placement criteria and matches a patient's severity of SUD illness with treatment levels that run a continuum marked by five basic levels of care, numbered Level 0.5 (early intervention) through Level 4 (medically managed intensive inpatient services). There are several ASAM training opportunities available for providers and counties. The ASAM eTraining series educates clinicians, counselors and other professionals involved in standardizing assessment, treatment and continued care. One -on-one consultation is also available to review individual or group cases with the Chief Editor of the ASAM Criteria. Additionally, there is a two -day training which provides participants with opportunities for skill practice at every stage of the treatment process: assessment, engagement, treatment planning, continuing care and discharge or transfer. There are also a variety of webinars available. At a minimum, providers and staff conducting assessments are required to complete the two e -Training modules entitled \"ASAM Multidimensional Assessment\" and \"From Assessment to Service Planning and Level of Care. A third module entitled, \"Introduction to The ASAM Criteria\" is recommended for all county and provider staff participating in the Waiver. With assistance from the State, counties will facilitate ASAM provider trainings. All residential providers must be designated to have met the ASAM requirements and receive a DHCS issued ASAM designation. DHCS will develop a designation program to ce rtify that all providers of Adult and Adolescent Level 3.1 -3.5 Residential/Inpatient Services are capable of delivering care consistent with ASAM Criteria. As part of this designation program, DHCS will develop a tool that includes the elements that defin e each sublevel of Level 3 services for Levels 3.1 -3.5, develop standard program monitoring materials and protocols, and implement the ASAM designation program. After developing the protocol and monitoring tool, DHCS will designate all current residential providers which will require initial paperwork and a DHCS designation. DHCS will then fold the ASAM designation process into the initial licensing process so all new residential providers will have an ASAM designation. Attachment Y Drug Medi -Cal Organized Delivery System (DMC -ODS) Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) Appeals Process California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 266 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 1. Following a county's contract protest procedure, a provider may appeal to DHCS if it believes that the county erroneously rejected the provider's solicitation for a contract. 2. A provider may appeal t o DHCS, following an unsuccessful contract protest, if the provider meets all objective qualifications and it has reason to believe the county has an inadequate network of providers to meet beneficiary need and the provider can demonstrate it is capable of providing high quality services under current rates, and: A. It can demonstrate arbitrary or inappropriate county fiscal limitations; or B. It can demonstrate that the contract was denied for reasons unrelated to the quality of the provider or network adequacy. 3. DHCS does not have the authority to enforce State or Federal equal employment opportunity laws through this appeal process. If a provider believes that a county's decision not to contract violated Federal or State equal employment opportunity laws, that p rovider should file a complaint with the appropriate government agency. 4. A provider shall have 30 calendar days from the conclusion of the county protest period to submit an appeal to the DHCS. Untimely appeals will not be considered. The provider shall s erve a copy of its appeal documentation on the county. The appeal documentation, together with a proof of service, may be served by certified mail, facsimile, or personal delivery. 5. The provider shall include the following documentation to DHCS for conside ration of an appeal: a) County's solicitation document; b) County's response to the county's solicitation document; c) County's written decision not to contract d) Documentation submitted for purposes of the county protest; e) Decision from county protest; and f) Evidence supporting the basis of appeal. 6. The county shall have 10 working days from the date set forth on the provider's proof of service to submit its written response with supporting documentation to DHCS. In its response, the County must include the following d ocumentation: 1) the qualification and selection procedures set forth in its solicitation documents; 2) the most current data pertaining to the number of providers within the county, the capacity of those providers, and the number of beneficiaries served i n the county, including any anticipated change in need and the rationale for the change; and 3) the basis for asserting that the appealing Provider should not have been awarded a contract based upon the County's solicitation procedures. The county shall se rve a copy of its response, together with a proof of service, to the provider by certified mail, facsimile, or personal delivery.

The reimbursements of these medications are detailed in the following table: MAT Drug Reimbursement Through the DMC -ODS and Medical System Medication TAR* Required Availability Methadone No Only in NTP/OTP Buprenorphine Yes, unless provided in an NTP/OTP Pharmacy Benefit, NTP/OTP Naltrexone tablets No Pharmacy Benefit, ODF DMC Benefit Naltrexone long -acting injection Yes Pharmacy Benefit, Physician Administered Drug Disulfiram No Pharmacy Benefit, NTP/OTP Acamprosate Yes Pharmacy Benefit Naloxone No Pharmacy Benefit; NTP/OTP *TAR (Treatment Authorization Request) There are different doors patients in need of Medication Assisted Treatment (MAT) enter the Medi -Cal system in California. Therefore, California makes the medications and the treatment services available in various settings. Depending on the setting th e patient is initially diagnosed with a substance use disorder, the administering and dispensing of MAT will vary. If a patient comes through the county system or directly to a Narcotic Treatment Program (NTP), the program is responsible for the prescribi ng, ordering, and monitoring service. The NTP also dispenses and administrates the MAT and all of this is reimbursed with a bundled rate. If a client is diagnosed by their non - DMC primary care doctor, the prescribing, ordering, and monitoring of the medi cation occurs during the office visit. After the office visit, the patient will fill the prescription at a pharmacy. Pharmacies are then reimbursed for the medication and dispensing of the medication. In some cases, the physician may administer the drug in the office. This is termed a \"physician administered drug\" and the physician is reimbursed for the drug and the administration directly. Patients receiving DMC outpatient services may also be prescribed MAT through a physician working at the program. The patient would then fill the prescription at the pharmacy.

More specifically, this strategy aims to increase the use of preventive dental services for children, prevent and treat more early childhood caries, and increase continuity of care for children. Given the importance of oral health to the overall health of an individual, California views improvements in dental as critical to achieving overall better health outcomes for Medi -Cal beneficiaries, particul arly children. The dental strategies implemented in this pool would be developed and operated by the Department and our Fee -For-Service (FFS) and Dental Managed Care (DMC) contractors. The DTI will be funded at a maximum of $148 million annually, except as provided below, for five (5) years totaling a maximum of $740 million (DTI Pool). To the extent any of the funds associated with the DTI are not fully expended in a given DY, those remaining prior DY funds may be available for DTI payments in subsequent years, notwithstanding the annual limits stated above. The program will include three (3) domains: preventive services, caries risk assessment and management, and continuity of care, i n addition to making funding available for local pilots that address one (1) or more of these three (3) domains. Specific incentive payments within each domain will be available to qualified providers, along with messaging and education to providers and b eneficiaries about programs and efforts in their local communities. The Department also intends to have participation from providers in both the FFS and DMC delivery systems beginning in DY 1. The Department will make incentive payments directly to contr acted service office locations that participate in the FFS and/or DMC delivery systems that qualify for incentive payments. The service office location is the business or pay -to address where services are rendered by the provider (which may be an individua l, partnership, group, association, corporation, institution, or entity that provides dental services). Incentive payments shall be issued to the service office location based on the services rendered at the location and compliance with the criteria enumer ated in the STCs. Dental Program Background The Medi -Cal Dental Program provides services to 5.5 million Medi -Cal child beneficiaries age twenty (20) and under. Dental services are provided through two (2) delivery systems: Medi -Cal Dental FFS, referred to as Denti -Cal, and DMC. Most beneficiaries are served through the dental FFS delivery system. The Department of Health Care Services (DHCS, Department) conducts oversight of the FFS contractor(s) and six (6) DMC contracts. As the expansion of dental benefits continues to cover more Californians, increased monitoring of beneficiary utilization and provider participation is crucial for identifying any access to dental care issues for children enrolled in the Medi - Cal Dental Program. Attachment JJ Medi -Cal 2020: Dental Transformation Incentive Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 289 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 DHCS facilitates access to oral health services for the FFS and DMC delivery systems in multiple ways, including through telephone service centers and correspondence controls for beneficiaries and providers; conducting beneficiary and provider outreach and education; strategies for monitoring and augmenting provider ne twork adequacy and beneficiary utilization; and providing regular reports to the Legislature, stakeholders, and Federal and State government entities. All data and measurement reporting associated with the DTI will be based on an annual reporting period b y Demonstration Year (DY).

DHCS is proposing to incentivize dental provider service office locations to increase preventive oral care to Medi -Cal children. Goals/Objectives (Project -specific Triple Aim goals and expected project outcomes) Increase the statewide proportion of children ages one (1) through twenty (20) and under enrolled in the Medi -Cal Dental Program and who receive a preventive dental service by ten (10) percentage points over a five (5) year period Maintain preventive oral care for children who previously received this service The incentive program will provide semi -annual incentive payments to dental provider service office locations that provide preventive services to an increased number of Medi -Cal children, as determined by the Department. Eligible providers will receive payments based on them achieving an increased number of Med i-Cal children who received eligible preventive dental services, as compared to a baseline pre -determined by the Department. Providers who render preventive services to a number of children that meets or exceeds a Department pre -determined number of benef iciaries, by county, would qualify for the incentive payment. Further, the program will also disburse incentive payments to providers who were not previously participating in Medi -Cal and rendering preventive services, but who do so during the demonstrati on, on the condition that they meet or exceed the provision of services based on the Department pre - determined number of beneficiaries, by county, needed to be served to achieve the goal. Safety net clinics would also be eligible for these incentives and would be supplied with incentive payments separate and apart from their Prospective Payment System (PPS) or Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) rates for Federally Qualified Health Centers/Rural Health Centers and Tribal Health Centers, respectively. Each safet y net clinic office location would be considered a dental service office location for purposes of this domain. The Department will determine the number of additional beneficiaries to be served in order to achieve the goal of ten (10) percentage point utilization increase statewide. That number will be distributed across counties based the county's proportional expected contribution to the statewide utilization increase. For example, if the number of child Medi -Cal beneficiaries in County A account for thirty (30) percent of the statewide Medi -Cal children population, and 100 users are necessary to increase the statewide utilization by ten (10) percentage points, then County A service office locations will need to serve an additional thirty (30) beneficiaries. If County A needs to serve thirty (30) additional beneficiaries and there are ten (10) service office loca tions enrolled in the program, that goal of thirty (30) additional users would then be equitably Attachment JJ Medi -Cal 2020: Dental Transformation Incentive Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 291 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 distributed across the number of service office locations in the county; therefore, each service office location in County A would need to see three (3) additi onal users to qualify for the incentive payment. The same Departmental -established per service office location goal, by county, would apply to both current and newly enrolled providers. DHCS may earn additional demonstration authority, up to a maximum of $10 million, to be added to the DTI Pool for use in paying incentives to qualifying providers under DTI, by achieving higher performance improvement, as indicated in the below table: DY Target $1 million in additional demonstration authority for achiev ing: $2 million in additional demonstration authority for achieving: 1 + two (2) percentage points over baseline year Not Applicable + three (3) or more percentage points over baseline year 2 + four (4) percentage points over baseline year +5 or more percentage points over the baseline + six (6) or more percentage points over baseline year 3 + six (6) percentage points over baseline year +7.5 or more percentage points over the baseline + nine (9) or more percentage points over baseline year 4 + eigh t (8) percentage points over baseline year +10 or more percentage points over the baseline + twelve (12) or more percentage points over baseline year 5 + ten (10) percentage points over baseline year +12.5 or more percentage points over the baseline + fifteen (15) or more percentage points over baseline year Each service office location will receive credit towards meeting or exceeding the Department pre -determined goal for every child to which they provide a preventive service within frequency limitations regardless of whether that child is a previously established patient of that service office location. However, service office locations will only be paid incentive payments on preventive services provided to those beneficiaries they provide se rvices to once they have met the Department established goal. The incentive payment for preventive services will equate to a payment of approximately seventy -five (75) percent above the Schedule of Maximum Allowances (SMA) for all preventive services prov ided to the children above the Department pre - determined threshold for the n umber of beneficiaries served. This number of beneficiaries is subject to the annual funding limits contained herein and any annual limit applicable to this specific domain. The incentive funding available for payments within this domain will not exceed the amount apportioned from the DTI pool to this domain for the applicable DY, except as provided for in the Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver Special Terms and Conditions (STCs). The results of this project will be used to determine if provider incentive payments are an effective method by which to encourage service office locations to provide medically necessary preventive dental services to more Medi -Cal children and to what extent an incen tive payment is an effective method for increasing Medi -Cal provider participation Attachment JJ Medi -Cal 2020: Dental Transformation Incentive Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 292 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 and improving access to care for children. The Department anticipates that increased preventive services will result in decreased long term costs for more invasive procedur es, one of the core tenants of the Triple Aim concept. Core Components The baseline year will consist of data from the most recent complete year preceding implementation of the waiver. Beneficiary utilization and service office location participation will be reassessed on an annual basis thereafter. The metrics that will be used for monitoring domain success are: 1. Percentage of beneficiaries who received any preventive dental service during the measurement period, which is calculated as follows: Numerator: Number of unduplicated children ages one (1) through twenty (20) enrolled in Medi -Cal for at least ninety (90) continuous days who received any Medi -Cal covered preventive dental service (D1000 -D1999) in the measurement period. Denominator: Num ber of unduplicated children ages one (1) through twenty (20) enrolled in Medi -Cal for at least ninety (90) continuous days during the measurement period. 2. Claims data to determine the number of service office locations in each county that are providing pr eventive dental services to children, compared to number of these locations in the baseline year. 3. Statewide the number and percentage change of Medicaid participating dentists providing preventive dental services to at least ten (10) Medicaid -enrolled ch ildren in the baseline year, and in each subsequent measurement year. A preliminary report will be delivered only to CMS for internal review six (6) months following the end of the applicable DY. An updated report will be delivered to CMS and published p ublicly twelve (12) months following the end of the applicable DY Projects Metrics Clinical Event Outcomes 1. Prevention Increase the utilization of children ages one (1) through twenty (20) enrolled in Medi -Cal who receive any preventive dental service, by at least ten (10) percentage points over a five (5) year period. 2. Access to Care Increase the number of actively parti cipating providers in each county who provide preventive services. Attachment JJ Medi -Cal 2020: Dental Transformation Incentive Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 293 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Project 2: Caries Risk Assessment and Disease Management Pilot Required Project Project Domain Caries Risk Assessment and Disease Management Pilot Rationale (Evidence base and reasoning behind project idea) Dentists today are embracing a philosophy of prevention and taking proactive measures to prevent and mitigate oral disease. The key elements of this model are to formally assess and manage caries risk and to emphasize the p rovision of preventive services in lieu of more invasive and costly procedures for Medi -Cal children age six (6) and under enrolled in the Medi -Cal Dental Program. Caries Risk Assessment (CRA) incorporates an evidence -based philosophy which focuses on pre ventive and intervention therapy based on an individual patient's caries risk through prevention, intervention, education, and identification. Ultimately, this will enable DHCS to work toward the achievement of the CMS Triple Aim goals by implementing pro vider incentives based on performing a CRA to identify a child's risk level, and developing and completing a beneficiary specific treatment plan. Additionally, it will enable the Medi -Cal Dental Program to improve the overall oral health of the enrolled b eneficiary population. Goals/Objectives (Project -specific Triple Aim goals and expected project outcomes) Diagnose early childhood caries and treat it as a chronic disease Introduce a model that proactively prevents and mitigates oral disease through the delivery of preventative services in lieu of more invasive and costly procedures, aimed at improving the population's oral health Track the target population's utilization of preventive and restorative services This four (4) year domain will only be a vailable initially to dentists in pilot counties that elect and are approved by the Department to participate in the program. The Department will begin this effort as a pilot in select counties and will then seek to implement on a statewide basis if the p ilot is determined to be successful and subject to the availability of funding under the DTI Pool. If successful, DHCS will consider expansion no sooner than nine (9) months following the end of DY 2. Through this effort, Medi -Cal dentists voluntarily participating in the domain will be eligible to receive incentive payments for performing pre-identified treatment plans for children based upon the beneficiary's risk level as determined by the dentist vi a a caries risk assessment which include motivaltional interviewing and use of antimicrobials, as indicated . Pilot counties will be identified and selected by the Department through an analysis of counties with a high percentage of restorative services, a low percentage of preventive services, and indication of likely enrolled service office location participation. The incentive program will only be available for services performed on child beneficiaries age six (6) and under. Dentists participating in the domain will be authorized to perform an increased number of services per year in accordance with the pre -identified treatment plan options based Attachment JJ Medi -Cal 2020: Dental Transformation Incentive Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 294 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 upon caries risk level, and are eligible to receive an incentive payment under this program for each additi onal service not currently covered under the California State Plan and frequency limitations listed in the Manual of Criteria. Subject to the annual funding limits contained herein and any annual limit applicable to this specific domain, qualifying servic e office locations will receive an incentive payment for providing each of these additional services. The incentive funding available for payments within this domain will not exceed the amount apportioned from the DTI pool to this domain for the applicabl e DY, except as provided for in the Medi -Cal 2020 Waiver STCs. The results of this project will be used to determine if this provider incentive program is effective in encouraging providers to perform a CRA for the targeted population and to ensure comple tion of the appropriate treatment plan for the management of childhood caries, if the utilization of emergency room visits for dental issues among the targeted children declines, if expenditures of emergency room visits non -traumatic dental issues among ta rgeted children declines, and if the utilization of and expenditures (including anesthesia and facility fees) for the targeted children receiving dental related general anesthesia declines. Core Components Dentists must first complete a CRA to determine the appropriate treatment plan for a child, and report the results of the CRA to DHCS on a claim. Once the risk level and the treatment plan have been determined, the beneficiary may be eligible for increase d frequency limitations on prophylaxis, topical fluoride varnish, and exams. The pre - identified treatment plans will be composed of the following procedures: CRA (which will globally include motivational interviewing, antimicrobials, and behavior modifica tion/nutritional counseling), application of topical fluoride varnish, toothbrush prophylaxis, and exams. Increased frequencies for prophylaxis, fluoride varnish, and exams will be permitted for children evaluated and determined to be at a particular caries risk level with frequency limitations in a twelve (12) month period, as follows: \"high risk\" will be authorized to visit their provider four (4) times; \"moderate risk\" children will be authorized to visit three (3) times; and \"low risk\" children two (2) times. Dentists will receive payment for completion of a CRA as well as each of the following services: application of topical fluoride varnish, toothbrush prophylaxis, and exams at their respective appropriate increased frequency limitations. The Dep artment will collect data and report on the following performance measures: 1. Number of, and percentage change in, restorative services; 2. Number of, and percentage change in, preventive dental services; 3. Utilization of CRA CDT codes and reduction of caries risk levels (not available in the baseline year prior to the Waiver implementation); 4. Change in use of emergency rooms for dental related reasons among the targeted children for this domain; and 5. Change in number and proportion of children receiving dental surgery under general anesthesia. Attachment JJ Medi -Cal 2020: Dental Transformation Incentive Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 295 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 The Department will also track and report on, for children in age ranges under one (1), one (1) through two (2), three (3) through four (4), and five (5) through six (6), the utilization rates for restorative procedures against preventive services to determine if the domain has been effective in reducing the number of restorations being performed. Because preventive services do not yield immediate effects, the Department will be required to collect data on these performa nce measures at annual intervals for a number of years to determine correlation and statistical significance. The Department will inform CMS of the number of additional years this data will be collected and reported no later than the end of DY 1. The Dep artment will also track and report on the utilization of CRA and treatment plan service to monitor utilization and domain participation. A preliminary report will be delivered only to CMS for internal review six (6) months following the end of the appli cable DY. An updated report will be delivered to CMS and published publicly twelve (12) months following the end of the applicable DY. Project Metrics Clinical Event Outcomes 1. Caries Risk Assessment Increase utilization of CRA CDT codes and monitor movement between risk levels 2. Caries Management Increase ratio of utilization of preventive services versus restorative Decrease utilization of use of emergency room and oral surgery for dental related reasons among children Attachment JJ Medi -Cal 2020: Dental Transformation Incentive Program California Medi -Cal 2020 Demonstration Page 296 of 307 Approved December 30, 2015 through December 31, 2020 Project 3: Increase Continuity of Care Required Project Project Domain Increase Continuity of Care Rationale (Evidence base and reasoning behind project idea) Maintaining a consistent relationship with a primary care dental provider can encourage children and their families to receive regular preventive care and to actively manage their care. Goals/Objectives (Project -specific Triple Aim goals and expected project outcomes) Increase dental continuity of care among Medi -Cal children enrolled in the Medi -Cal Dental Program The Department will begin this effort as a pilot in select counties and will then seek to implement on a statewide basis if the pilot is determined to be successful and subject to the availability of fundi ng under the DTI Pool. If successful, DHCS will consider expansion no sooner than nine (9) months following the end of DY 2. The results of this project will be used to determine if incentive payments are effective in promoting continuity of care, consis tent with the enumerated Triple Aim goals. Core Components To encourage the continuity of care within the beneficiary population, an incentive payment would be paid to dental provider service office locations who have maintained continuity of care through providing examinations for their enrolled child beneficiaries, age twenty (20) and under for two (2), three (3), four (4), five (5), and six (6) year continuous periods. The incentive will be a flat payment for providing continuity of care to the beneficiary. Incentive payments will be made annually. The baseline year will be based on data from the most recent complete state fiscal year. Using claims data, DHCS will determine the number of beneficiaries who have remained with their same service office location for two ( 2), three (3), four (4), five (5), and six (6) year continuous periods following the establishment of the baseline year throughout the demonstration period. This will be calculated as follows: Numerator: Number of children age twenty (20) and under who received an examination from the same service office location with no gap in service for two (2), three (3), four (4), five (5), and six (6) year continuous periods . Denominator: Number of children age twenty (20) and under enr olled in the delivery system during the measurement periods. This measure is similar to the Dental Quality Alliance measure Usual Source of Services, with the exception that the Department would incent over a longer continuous period.
