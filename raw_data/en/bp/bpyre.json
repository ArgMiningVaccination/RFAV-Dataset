In the West, acupuncture and herbal medicine are the most commonly used TCM modalities. Acupuncture involves the insertion of fine metallic needles at defined locations. Herbal treatment constitutes injesting an empirically determined herbal formula often consisting of roots, berries, leaves or twigs. Even though this ancient medical system has developed in China over some 3000 years, TCM is enjoying a renaissance in occidental countries such as England (Chan & Lee 2002), the United States (Hui et al. 2002) and Australia (MacLennan et al. 2002).
