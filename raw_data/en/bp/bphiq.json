I've been to a few other crystal shops in Northern Virginia but I must say this one was really impressive. The actual shop is located inside of a bigger building where other businesses rent out suites. It's really not that difficult to find if you read the signs correctly (go in through entrance 3). Once I arrived, the staff there immediately greeted me and the energy inside was very welcoming. They have a pretty large selection of crystals from huge massive pieces to small tumbled stones. They also have other things for sale such as jewelry and crystal/chakras/affirmation reference charts. Compared to other shops in the area, they do offer a lot more for sale. I will say that the crystals are a little bit on the pricer side at this shop. They also had incense for sale but no incense holder/ash catcher which is what I was looking for. Other than that this place was great. - 6/20/2022 They shipped me a stone that was damaged in transit. I took a picture of it and they said that is how the stone is made. Will not shop here again. - 5/6/2021 I've been here several times pre-pandemic between 2018-2019 and always admired the large gemstones, geodes, salt lamps and selenite etc. in their showroom. I went primarily to look for beads and jewelry findings and this is not their forte, however, if you want to touch & see various natural gemstones and crystals, they now have a very nice selection of both raw and tumbled/polished stones, all organized and labelled in alphabetical bins. Now that they've re-opened on Wednesdays for in-store shopping via appointments, it's nice to be able to be among the healing crystals and their energy again! Romina, the store manager was extremely helpful, patient and accommodating, frequently going back to the storage room to find additional stones for me if I couldn't easily find what I was looking for on display. She explained so many things to me e.g. how to look for chalcedony among the amethyst & the difference between Uraguayan and Brazilian amethyst and I felt fortunate having the opportunity to have her expertise as I shopped. Be sure to call ahead to make an appointment and be patient as they get a high volume of phone calls. "}
