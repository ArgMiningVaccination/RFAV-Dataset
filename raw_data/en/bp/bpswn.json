July 2022Lay Sum mary BACKG ROUN D As of June 2022 withlifting of provincial public health orders, AHS isresponsible for setting indoor mask policies within healthcare facilities. Continuous mask policies have been widely implemented in healthcare settings as part of agroup ofactions intended toreduce the risk ofCOVID-19 spread in hospitals and among healthcare workers Masking inhospitals is a core part of personal protective equipment and data suggests continuous masking may be helpful during COVID-19 surges however, continuous masking may have some unwanted physical, emotional, and communication effects as well asenvironmental, and financial implications that should beconsidered. This review is intended toprovide information to AHS decision-m akers who are setting AHS policies for continuous masking in healthcare settings. KEY MES SAGE S Theevidence identified in this review cannot definitively show specific effect of continuous masking which started at the same time as multiple protective measures healthcare settings, and thelevel of evidence is not strong. However, the studies all showed similar findings which support continuous masking wasassociated with a decreased risk of COVID-19 infection inhospitals. Looking atpractices across Canada, all other Canadian provinces currently have maintained mask policies inhealthcare settings regardless of provincially public health mandate removal. Criteria or rationale for changing mask requirements in healthcare settings are suggested indocuments from Ontario and Nova Scotia. Thecommittee suggested thatmask policies and policies for other measures should bereassessed as the pandemic evolves. For example, a process which considers the data (which is limited) on theabsolute benefit of continuous masking over situational masking, the presence and impact of other respiratory illnesses and healthcare strain related should bedeveloped. RECOMM ENDATIONS The evidence overall sugg ests that likely beneficial in reducing healthcare setting-based transmission; howeve r, the absolute benefit of a contin uous or universa l masking policy (implementationor withdrawal) sh ould be conside red in the context of other fa ctors su ch as the other measures that remain in place, and formally tracke d epidemiologic risk indicat ors that will inform modification of masking and other health care respiratory virus control policies. 4 Last revised:4 July 2022 Since the available evidenc e does not provid e a defin itive guidanc e on use or non- use of continuous masking specific to the current and evolving context, specific optio ns and caveats for modifyi ng the AHS masking policy are available in the Practical Guidance section o f this report. 5 Last revised:4 July 2022 Authorshi p and Comm ittee Me mbers Name Contribution Rach ael Erdman n Writer - Evidence extraction, primary evidenc e synthesis Heather Sharpe Writer - Jurisdiction al Scan Rach el Zhao Rese arch Librarian Lynora Saxin ger & Scott Klarenbach Primary Scie ntific Re viewers Stephen Tskreko s, Kristin Klein, John C only, Elizabet h Mackay, Rosa na Salvaterra, Scott Klarenbach Scientific A dvisory Group ch airs (oversight and leadership responsibil ity) John C only, A lexander Doro shenk o, Discussion , revisi on, and approv al of document Questions or comments about this revie w can b e sent to ScientificAdvis oryGroup@ahs.ca \u00a9 2022, Alberta Health Services, COVID-19 Scientific Advisory Group This copyright work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivative 4.0 International license.

What is the impa ct of continuous masking policies (compa red with no continuous masking) on the numb er of fac ility outbreaks, and on in- hospi tal trans mission to patients and staff in acute care settings? 2. What are other orga nizations in Ca nada doing with re spect to continuous masking in healthca re facilities (both acute care and long -term care?) Contex t As public health orders, includin g masking requirements, across Canada are rescind ed due to rapidly declining prevalence and s everity of COV ID-19 (as of June 2022), it is prudent to consider th e impact of continuous staff masking to reduce the risk of COV ID-19 transmission within health care facilities. Most healthcare systems implemented continuo us maskin g policies as part of a bundle of interventio ns to try to reduce transmission of COV ID-19 in health care settings; masking may also impact other respiratory virus transmission. The context of COVID-19 co mmunity transmission has evolved since mask policies were originally designed and implemented in 2020: o There has been recent wide spread Omicron transmission despite existing measures and current vaccina tion levels, with sustained CO VID-19 vaccine effectiveness agains t severe consequenc es including hosp italization, but reduced protection against infection. o Com pliance with personal p rotective equipme nt (PPE) protocols is felt to have decre ased, potentially related to individual fatigue and perception of importance , and reports that some HCW are relying on vaccination without recognizing increased Omicron infection risk. o The potential impact of new, potentia lly more transmissible VOCs (particularly Omicron BA.4 and BA.5), as well as potential wan ing vaccine effectiveness or diverg ence betwe en cir culating COV ID-19 strain and vaccine effectiveness , on both community and healthcare burden of COV ID-19 over the summer and fall is still unclear. Continuous masking could have physical i mpacts on indivi duals a s well a s non- physical im pacts on inter-person al communic ation and the emotiona l patie nt care (see previous SAG revie w identifying evidence to support continuous masking policies, SAG revie w ide ntifying the potential harms of masks, and SAG revie w on other potential risks o f masks). This is a concern particularly in populations with communicat ion challenges (such as the elderly, those with communication disord ers, or in addictio ns and mental health), wh ere lip reading and/or interpreting facial non-verbal cues is a prominent part of communication. Conversely, masking policies may also provid e reassurance to patie nts, families, and staff who are anxious a bout coming into healt hcare settings. The optics o f a universa l mask policy may be sig nifican t, as a face mask ca n serve as a reminder of the risks of respiratory viruses; that other risk m itigatio n activities 7 Last revised:4 July 2022 should continue (such as hand hygiene, physi cal distancing, and self-monitoring for sym ptoms); and that AHS is inv ested in the physical and psychological sa fety of their staff. There are both envir onmental and monetary costs to consider in continuous masking assessment, as staff members r equire multiple masks per shift. Over the life cycle of the product, masks and respirators are a source of energy consu mption, greenhouse gas emissions, and polypropylene pollution (At lgan T\u00fcrkmen , 2022; Du, Huang ations Envir onment Programme, 2022). In the past month (May 15 - June 14 2022), nearly $4 million wa s spent on masks that were distributed to AHS sites, contracted provid ers, and third parties. This accounts for 8,474,608 masks, although d oes not reflect exact usage over this tim e period (p ersonal co mmunica tion). As of June 2022, with lifting o f provin cial public health orders, AHS is responsible for setting indoor mask policies within healthcare facilities. This revie w is intended to provid e informati on to AHS decision-makers who are setting A HS policies for contin uous masking in healt hcare settings. Terminolog y and Definitions AHS u ses the term \"continuous masking\" to refer to the organizat ional Use of Dir ective (HCS -267; updated Ma rch 22, 2022). In this policy, AHS P eople (anyone who provid es care or services, or who acts on behalf o f AHS) are required to wear a mask at all times in all areas of an AHS facility (clinical or non- clinical) while provid ing patient care, worki ng in patient care areas, or performing job duties. Inpatients are not requir ed to wear a mask in their bed s pace but must contin uously mask when outside of their bed space . The AHS PPE policy for visitors (updated M arch 2 5, 2022) mirrors th e policy for AHS People . The Directive differentiates betwe en clinica l areas, non-clinical a reas with in facilities where care is provid ed (i.e. no direct conta ct with patie nts or patient items) and administrat ive settings wh ere no care is p rovid ed. The literature largely uses \"universa l masking\" to refer to policies where staff and visitors are ma ndated to wear a well-fitting face covering (eg. surgica l mask or N95 respirator) at all times in the facility, but patie nts are obligated to wear a mask wh en out of their rooms or when others (staff or visitors) are in the room. For th e purpo ses of this review, 'universal masking' and 'continuous masking ' are used interchangeably. 8 Last revised:4 July 2022 Key Mes sages from the Evi denc e Summary Assessed literature and documents: The body of primary evidence around the impact of continuous masking is of very low to low quality as there are no contro lled studies, only o bservational studies and re trospec tive surveys. The evidence that was identified i n the database search is highly co nfounded and at high risk of bias; howev er, consistency of direction of effect (benefit) was noted. Twenty-two primary articles were identified for inclusion in this revie w and policy information for the ju risdiction al scan was gathered from Canadian provin cial a nd territorial healt hcare organizations . Key me ssag es from t he primary literature review: The methods used are insufficient to definitively show t he effect of contin uous masking policies as an isolated infection preventio n and control (IPC ) measure in hosp ital settings. No contro lled studies were identifi ed, and the observational studies are at high risk of bias due to confounding with concurrent \"bundle d\" IPC measures and infection prevention behavio urs by health care wo rkers (HCWs). Retrospective studies using a survey methodology to determine PPE compliance are at risk of recall bias and social d esirability bias. Desp ite the quali ty shortcomings of the identified evidence, findings were consiste nt, which incre ases confidence in the finding s. All included studies sugg ested that the implementation of a continuous masking policy, with or without an accompanying su ite of IPC measures, was associated wit h decre ased risk of infection for HCWs and patie nts. The literature largely uses 'universa l masking' to refer to policies where staff and visito rs are mandated to wear a well- fitting face covering (eg. surgica l mask or N95 respirator) at all times in the facility, and patients are obligated to wear a mask wh en out of their rooms or when others (staff or visitors) are in the ro om. All of the included primary stu dies on continuous masking policies were cond ucted at the beginning of the pandemic, largely between February and May 2020. The generali zability of findings may be reduced by the behavi oural differences in individuals a t the beginning of the pandem ic compared to now; the lack of data post-COV ID vaccina tion; and presence of new variants of concern (which may impact the effectiveness of masking), as both the perso nal ri sk of severe infection has decreased with vaccina tion, and the impact of preventative measures apparently diluted. Five studies were identified that suggested increased odds of occupational COV ID-19 in fection in healt hcare settings were associated wit h poor PPE compliance (in non-COV ID-19 units) or staff interactions outside of patient care 9 Last revised:4 July 2022 space s (e.g. breakroom, classro oms, or office spaces). COV ID-19 infection was also more strongly associated with community or home transmission than with occupational transmission. Anecd otal observations f rom Alberta suggest that HCW -patie nt transmission of COV ID-19 is more likely t o occur due to breaches in mask continuity fo r the purposes of source contro l (as opposed to person al protection) (personal c ommunication). In some cases, working on a COV ID-19 unit (compared with non-COV ID-19 units) was protective against infection and thought to be due to the consiste nt PPE a nd high standards of compliance, supporting the conclusio n that even in high-risk health care settings, PPE compliance is protective against transmission of COV ID-19. Three studies showe d that continuous mask policies were associated with a reduction in incident COV ID-19 among HCW s, even while community ra tes were rising. While these studies are at high risk of bias and co nfounding, case positivi ty and incidence rates for COVID-19 decreased specifically a mong HCW s, while the rates continued to increase in the community after the introducti on of universa l mask policies. The best example is Lan (2020), whe re the slope i n incident rates over time in HCW and community overlapped in the pre- intervention period (0 .96 and 0.99, respectively), decreased for HCWs but not community in the post-interventi on period (-0.68 and 0.99, respectiv ely); and overlapped again for both HCW s and community during the epidemic decline (- 0.90 and -0.99, respectively). Results from t he jurisdictional scan: Currently all Canadian provin ces have removed mask mandates in publi c space s, although most provid e exceptions for health care settings, long-term care, and other settings with vulnerable perso ns (Albe rta, Manitoba, North west Territories, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, and Yukon do not specify a n exceptio n for healt hcare settings). Ontario has removed all mask mandates, however individual healt h care organizations have established their own mask policies for visitors, patients and staff. In Alberta , healthcare masking policy has shifted to an organizational policy by Alberta Health Services. There is limited evidence in the ju risdictional scan t hat provid es specific information r egardi ng the cri teria or rationale for changing mask mandate in healt hcare settings. Nova Scotia provid es a four-tier tool based upon community risk level, staff absences, admissions, hospitalizations and health care risk -HCW vaccine uptake (although it has not been validated). This risk assessment outline s mask protocols in a variety of healthcare se ttings (su ch as inpati ent units, break rooms, waiting rooms, etc.) based upon the perceiv ed risk at the time. 10 Last revised:4 July 2022 Mask m andates have been lifted in most international jurisdiction s, although some persist. Most commonly, existing mask mandates focus on confined space s (su ch as transit) and healt h care settings, or settings in which vulnerable individuals may reside. It is unclear if they have affected COV ID-19 incidence rates in these settings. Comm entary and Expert O pinion on Evidenc e Summary The benefit of masks cannot be definitively determined from existing evidence, as masking is often st udied within a bundle of other IPC interventions, and there is an a bsenc e of randomized trials (the most rigorous study desig n). Howe ver, the consiste ncy of the evidence, in context of other information on transmissibility, indicates that continuous or universa l masking in health care settings is associated with a reduction of transmission of the re spiratory virus COV ID-19. The benefit of continuous masking in health care se ttings wil l be influenc ed by both the absolute risk of transmission (lower risk with lower p revalence); the degre e of protection against transmission of specific va riants; the degree of vaccination among patients and HCW s and vaccine effectiveness against infection (versus against severe outcomes) and the conse quences to those at risk of infection (st aff absenteeism, severity in immunocompromised person s). No evidence was identified regarding the cost-effectiveness of universal m ask policies. There a re other considerations and contextual factors that inform the decision to implement, modify, or withdraw a universa l masking policy in healthcare se ttings. These have been reported and discusse d in previo us SAG here: o Contin uous masking may be associated with some (usually small) physical h arms to the wearer and potential emotional and psychosocial harm s due to the communication barriers and impact on the therapeutic relationsh ip (Lee, Cormier & Shar ma, 2022; Chu et al., 2021).; AHS Scientific A dvisory G roup, 2020). Howe ver, the experience over the last 27 months is that continuo us maskin g policies have been functional and broadly acceptable when there is demonstrated need. o Althou gh they may not be st rictly req uired from an IPC persp ective, mask policies may improve or maintain the perce ption that the organization is invested in staff safety and help mitigate a contributor to staff burnout (COV ID-END and AHS Scientific Advisory G roup, 2022). A face mask provid es a visual reminder to staff, visito rs, and patients that COV ID-19 is still a risk. Howe ver, maintaining a continuous mask policy may also 11 Last revised:4 July 2022 contri bute to mask fatigue and reduce overall adherence to policy or donning/doffing procedures. o The consequences of COV ID-19 in fection, relative to other respiratory viruses (e.g. influenza or respiratory syn cytial virus (RSV)) should be conside red. There is relatively h igh acceptance of the risk of influenz a infection compared to COV ID-19 in and occupa tional infections should be considered in the conte xt of a highly-vaccinated population. o As we transition to a potential state of \"living with COV ID-19\", t he prevalence and cir culation of other respiratory viruse s in the population and the accompanyin g health system effects must be consid ered together. There is e vidence of a surge of influenza and RSV due to \"imm unity debt\" that may present a higher risk of nosocomial transmission than CO VID-19 (Hatter et al., 2021). This has i mplications o n workforce p lanning (both clinical a nd non-clinical) a s well as patient safety. Continuous masking may attenuate transmission and attendant consequenc es of other respiratory viruses, in additio n to COV ID-19. o Other ch anges t o \"bundled\" health care transmission protection measures are under co nsideration. Given the uncertainty in the pandemic trajectory, a stepwise and gradual appro ach guide d by internal data and experi ence is sugg ested. Continuous masking offers potential addition al potential benefit over measu res such as sympt om scre ening in individuals wh o may be pauci-symptomatic or who may shed viabl e virus after infection but following sy mptom resolution. The vulnerability of the population in the healthcare se tting is also relevant. If there is docu mented stability in community transmission without VOC conce rns, stepwise change should consider m aintaining continuous masking in settings with a high proporti on of vulnerable indivi duals (eg. long-term care, cance r care, immunoc ompromised patie nt ward s) who may benefit from masking, and lifted in lower-risk se ttings such as non-clinical facilities (i.e. corporat e or administrat ive buildings). There is limited evidence on metrics that might be used to determine the thresholds for lifting or implementing universa l masking policies. Nova Scotia recommends c ommunity ca se positivi ty rates; Ontario recommends community positivi ty rate, wastewater surveillance, and disease severity; and the Un ited States Cent ers for Disease Contro l and Preventio n recommend a matrix of indicators including COV ID-19 testing -weekly new p ositive/ 100,000 in previo us and % positivity, wastewater and syndromic surveillance , high risk settings/events, to describe the level of community transmission (Centers for 12 Last revised:4 July 2022 Disease Control and Prevention, 2022b). Notably, t hese metrics re ly on a robust testing strategy that accurately ref lects community t ransmission. Vaccina tion rates were not iden tified by other s as part of their indic ator fram ework and s hould be considered in the context of current vaccine effectiveness . A need to develop a process of iterative risk re view of a set of potential indicators was identified and this will be expanded in a companio n SAG discussi on document. There wa s limited evidence identifi ed from non-Canadian ju risdictions regardin g thresholds IPC interventions. ittee Di scussion The committee general ly supp orted the findings and commentary included in this revie w. They agreed w ith the writer and primary reviewe rs that a definitive recommendation about maintaining, modifying , or withdrawi ng a mask policy ca nnot be made by the Scientific Advisory G roup given existing evidence. The discussion f ocused on the most effective way to clearly articulate the co ntextual factors that ought to be conside red. These include but are not limited to: circulating COV ID-19 va riants and and patie rates; specific ealth plications of masking policies; and the acceptability and desire for masks among staff. One committee member did not agree with the statement in the recommendatio ns sugg esting that continuous masking policies may be beneficial, as evidence for masking policies (whether ta rgeted or continuous) is derived f rom the context of a bundle of activities and theref ore the specific benefit of contin uous masking policies canno t be determined. In the absence of contro lled studies and thorough investigatio n, the re ason for tran smission events in one setting and not in another ca nnot be ascribed s olely to the presence or absence of a continuous masking policy. The member w as supportive of the holistic a pproach to modifying the policy, where the masking policy is co nsidered in the context of a suite of interventions to reduce transmission risk. A major limitation of the evidence - that masking policies are frequently not studied in isolation - provid es a useful framework for considering this problem. Masking policies are often part of a larger IPC bundle that includes scre ening procedures, hand hygiene, additio nal P PE measures, vaccination policies, and visito r policies. Becaus e we cannot quantify the specific benefit of masking within a suite of interventions , the commit tee was supportive of a step-wise approach to modifying what has now become the standard of care, along with monitoring of important indicat ors. For example, if the contin uous masking policy is p ause d, a scre ening procedure might be maintained. A more rapid appro ach might be taken in lower risk se ttings (e.g. non-clinical a reas), while high-risk se ttings with vulnerable popula tions could benefit from a slower, more methodic al timeline. 13 Last revised:4 July 2022 Recomm endati ons 1. The evidence overall is of low quali ty but suggests that contin uous masking in lute benefit of a universa l masking policy is dependent upon the absolute risk and consequences of infection. The modific ation of a mask policy (implementation or withdrawal) sh ould be conside red in the context of other fa ctors su ch as the other IPC measures in place, and formally tracked e pidemiologic risk indicat ors that will inform modific ation of masking and other healt hcare respiratory virus control policies. Rationale: Although the evidence is overall low quali ty, on balance it suggests that masking in the health care setting (a long with other IP C strategies) red uces the risk of nosocomial COV ID-19 transmission. Howe ver, the contextual changes betwe en the beginning of the pandemic and now are su bstantial. Ma sking should be co nsidered as part of a bundle of IPC activities that are monito red in the conte xt of circulating respiratory pathogens, staff presenteeism, hand hygiene rates, and vaccina tion rates and that are with drawn in a stepwise manner. Practical Cons ideration s In health care settings, the present policy (co ntinuous masking) should be conside red in the context of other measures in place as well as data-based indicators of respiratory infection transmission risk in the community and healt hcare settings and reassessed re gularl y. The additio nal a bsolute benefit of contin uous masking would be expected to decrea se as the prevalence of COV ID-19 and other circula ting r espiratory pathogens decreases, and as the risk of severe outcomes decreases (due to vaccina tion), or if masking is found less efficacious against particular variants of COV ID-19 or other respiratory illness es. Given t he potentia l psychoso cial/emotional, environmental, and resource implications of the continuous masking policy, if the policy is modified during scenari os assessed as lower ri sk, data collection to determine the effect on noso comial re spiratory infections, hosp ital outbreaks tation of policies may also possibly be locally customized to conside r setting-specific contextual factors su ch as: o Risk of other respiratory virus transmission that may be attenuated with masking o Patie nt population vulnerability (immunocompromised, canc er care, long term care) o Potential harms to patient care including impaired co mmunication and therapeutic re lations hip 14 Last revised:4 July 2022 o Potential mitigating st rategies available (e.g. masks with clear w indows, campaigns to empowe r patients to ask their care provid er to wear a mask, promot ion of hand hygiene and aseptic technique) o The overall bundle of respiratory illness prevention measures in use (e.g targeted masking, entrance scre ening, visitor policies, distancin g, vaccina tion rates, etc.) There are no validated, evidence-based thresholds or metrics to guide de- implementation of universa l masking in the health care se tting. The sugg ested metrics in the grey literature are predicated on factors su ch as community incidence data sources , wastewater indicators, and hospitalization ra tes. For a more fulsome discussi on of indicator metrics for IPC interventions, please see the ancillary d iscussio n paper d eveloped by SAG, base d on Alberta data. o Potential community prevalence indic ators suggest ed in the grey literature include (weekly): Test positivi ty rates by RT-PCR for COVID, influenz a, and other respiratory infections Trend in COVID-19 RT -PCR positive rates Calls to Healt hlink for influenza-like illness Wastewater surveillance from Centre Informatics COV ID primary/attributable hosp italizations o Healthcare-based metrics could include Healthcare based outbreak data (number o f outbreaks, volume of cases/outbreak) Staff absenteeism for illness WHS health care wo rker test positivity metrics Research G aps In the reviewe d literature t here is no consist ent definition of \"univers al masking\" and could be applied on both a macro level (e.g. to a facility) o r on a micro level (e.g. to a single unit). The evidence for the effectiveness of masks is from acute care settings. There are co ntextual d ifferences between acute care and continuing care that impact the breadth, effectiveness of masking policies and the consequenc es of removing these policies. Masking was often implemented as part of a suite of interventions. The effect of masking is difficult to disentangle from the synergistic e ffects of the IPC intervention bundle (i.e. no contro lled studies were iden tified studying universal masking polices). No studies were identified that address ed targeted masking strategies. 15 Last revised:4 July 2022 Information on PPE/masking compliance was not often re porte d in the identifie d studies. No cost-effectiveness information for mask policies was identified. No evidence was identified evaluating masks in the context of highly transmissible variants of concern. There wa s no evidence on the addition al effects of masks in a highly vaccina ted population. No evidence on the effects of a universa l mask policy when COV ID-19 is ubiqu itous in the community . Strength of Ev idence In general, the evidence identified and included from the primary literature wa s overall of very-low to low q uality, although notably is very co nsistent - every included article reports that universa l masking policies are an effective tool to limit COV ID-19 spread within a hosp ital setting; increase s confid ence in this conclusio n. The observational methodologies in the body of evidenc e are insufficien t to definitively determine the effect of universa l masking. In most cases, there wa s no controlled comparator group to show th e effect of masks. The hosp itals whe re universa l masking was implemented often concurrently in troduc ed a suite of IPC measures that interact to protect individuals in the hospital (eg. enhanced cle aning measures; enhanced scree ning, testing, d istancing measures; gathering restrictions; and visito r restriction). I n many ca ses, these additional interventions were not adjust ed in the analysis and in troduc e a very high risk of confounding in these studies. In the case of outbreak investigations , the introduction of masks m ay be accompanied by increased s taff aware ness of circulating COV ID-19, which may introduce preventio n behavio urs that are not accounted for in the analysis and further confound the results. Further, the epidemiological in vestigation re ports often used HC W self-report methods and retrospective surveys to assess PPE u se among the st udy population. These methods are at high risk of recall bias, social d esirability bias, and ascertainment bias, which may result in an overestimate of the effectiveness of the intervention. The included evidence was nearly entirely c ollected during 2020, when the efficacy of masks wa s still under debate and universal masking policies were conside red a major policy re sponse to the pandemic. Since masks have become generally accept able and no hospital has published the re sults of lifting their universal maskin g policy, no new evidence has been published to confirm the effectiveness of mask policies in the face of high community transmission, COVID-19 variants of concern, and high vaccination rates among healthcare workers. 16 Last revised:4 July 2022 In addition , every jurisdiction experi enced the start of the pandemic in a different way. Alberta, for example, had a very mild first wav e that resulted in fewer than 10000 reported cases; by comparison, New York C ity and Northern Italy experi ence d high caseloads that overwhelmed health care resources, partially due to extensive transmission before the impacts of COV ID-19 we re recognized as significan t. Differences in community transmission and public health measures may also impact the effectiveness of a hospital mask mandate. Limitations of this review This revie w is subjec t to several limitations. First, this is int ended to be a rapid review and w as conducted under tig ht time pressu res, so the databas e search was thorough but pragmatic and only articles in English were included. It is possibl e that relevant studies were not identified. As described above, the overall body of evidence is of very low - low quality even though is la rgely p eer-revie wed. Accordingly, the re commendations arising from this revie w must be based on both evidence and expert opinio n, to address the differences in context betwe en the start of the pandem ic and the present situation (e .g. highly transmissible variants of concern, high levels of community transmission, or masks in highly vaccinated populat ions). Summary of Evidenc e The database search for primary literature returned over 450 records related to masking policies as a COV ID-19 control measu re, published b etween 2020 and 2022. The librarian co nducted an initial pre-scree n for relevanc e and forwarded 135 articles for further review. Following a further title and abstract screen and a full text revie w step, 113 articles were excluded i n accordanc e with the pre-determined inclusion a nd exclusion cri teria. 22 primary articles were included in the narrative synthesis and are descri bed more fully in Table 4 in the appendix. The jurisdiction al scan was conducte d as a search o f publicly available documents and supp orting news st ories from comparable jurisdiction s to Alberta. Informati on wa s extracted regarding the presence or absence of a mask mandate for the general population; the presence or absenc e of a mask m andate for visitors to healthcare facilities; and the presence or abse nce of a mask man date for staff worki ng in the facility. Policies were identifi ed for all Canadian ju risdictions. The results are descri bed in Table 1. 17 Last revised:4 July 2022 What is the impact of continuou s masking policies (compared with no continuou s masking) on the number of facility outbreaks, and on in-hospital transmission to patients and staff? Evidence from se condary and grey literature One systematic re view and meta-analysi s was identifi ed that reported on univers al masking policies (Ingram et al., 2021); howev er, this systematic re view examined multiple aspects of COVID-19 prevention measures and did not focus heavily on universal masking, with a very low- quali ty meta-analysi s on the effects of universa l masking. The analysi s methods and data sources are not clearly described and the relationsh ip between the original data and the conclusions is absent . Further, the included primary stu dies are subject to the same risk of bias and confounding that are descri bed above. Evidence from t he primary literature As noted above, 22 primary articles were identified for inclusio n in this revie w. No randomized iden tified. Five tive observational/descri studies were identified and in cluded in this revie w (Abe et al., 2020; Ambrosch et al., 2020; dia et et al., 2021; et al., preprint). In these studies, universa l masking was largely implemented as a tool to limit SARS -CoV-2 transmission after the outbreak had been identified;; masking wa s frequently i mplemented in combination with other infection contro l stra tegies. These studies are of varying quality. Outbreak investigati ons o ffer limited s upport for universal masking but are not conclusive - the implemen tation of contro l measures and potential behaviour changes (e.g. PPE compliance) confound the results and there is no defin itive way to demonstrate that the trajectory of the outbreak was changed by the masking policies without a comparator (i.e., the outbreak may have ended at the sa me time without the implementation of masking policies). At the low end of the quality spectrum, the effectiveness of masking is spec ulative - the authors note that the outbreaks stopped after the implementation of enhance d COV ID- 19 prevention measures (including but not limited to universa l masking) but offer minimal analysis or statistics t o show that the masking policy wa s the single definitive reason for end of the outbreak (Abe et al., 2021; Ariza-Here dia et al., 2020; Brandt et al., 2021). The investigation c onducted by Ariza-Here dia (2020) notes that of the three transmission clusters identifi ed during their outbreak, all transmission events could be traced t o time periods where the index and secondary ca ses were not wearing masks, such as socializ ing in the break room, eating, or talking on the phone while in the same office. Further, no HC W-to-patient spread was identified during this outbreak as surgica l masks we re worn during all patie nt encounters (Ariza-Here dia et al., 2020). 18 Last revised:4 July 2022 Two studies were identified where forward transmission was quantified a fter the implementation of masks but cannot be formall y designated as pre-/post- implementation studies (Ambrosch et al., 2020; Pletz et Both showed substa ntial decreases in COV ID-19 cases after the implementation of IPC bundles that included universal mas king. Pletz (prep rint) showed the HCW infection ra te decreased from 10.1% in the pre-implementation period to 0.4% post-implementation of the IPC bundle. Similarly, Ambrosch (2020) sh owed that the ra te of nosocomial COV ID-19 infections decrease d ID-19) to 0.06 (5/87) (p = 0.026)) following the implementation of a broad infection co ntrol bundle. Like the outbreak investigations, these two studies are confounded by the complementary IPC interventions and the potential for altered behaviour patterns in healthcare wo rkers following implementation. Five quasi -experimental studies showed that implementation of universa l masking in healt hcare settings significan the risk of COV ID-19 among HCWs, although the results are heavily confounded ti et al., 2021; Temkin et al., et al., 2021; Walke r et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020). Gras-Valen ti (2021) showed specifically t hat the incidence of COV ID-19 ca ses among healthcare workers decrea sed from 22.3/1000 to 8.2/1000 following the implementation of universa l masking (5 days after the State of Alarm was declare d in Spain). T his correspon ds to a 63% d ecrease in relative risk of COV ID-19 in fection following the mask m andate, regardless of transmission from symptomatic or asymptomatic indivi duals (Gr as-Valenti et al., 2021). Temkin an inversion of the slope of COV ID-19 incidence following the im plementation of a universa l mask policy as part of as set of interventions (leading to possible confounding). In the pre-intervention period, the adjust ed slo pe in COV ID-19 in cidence among HCW s infected at work was 0.5 (0.2-0.8) (p= 0.001), compared to the post-intervention period wh ere the slo pe changed to 0.2 (0.3 to 0.1) (p<.001) (Tem kin et al., 2021). This chan ge in slope in the post- intervention period is also shown by Wang (2020), wh o reports mean increase of case positivi ty rates (1.16% per d ay) among HCW s in the pre-intervention period and a mean decrea se of positivity rates of 0.49% in the post-intervention period (net change of 1.65% (95% , 2021) both show that reported expos ures to COVID-19 also declined i n the period following univers al masking implementation. Tubiana (2021) reports that among 146 exposed HCW s, exposure from a COV ID-19 positive patient declined from 67% to 16% in the periods before and after the masking policy, respectively. This suggests that colleague-to-colleagu e transmission became predominant and supports the need for masking in non-patie nt care space s (Tu biana, 2021). Walker (20 21) reports a similar finding , where healt hcare worker reports of COV ID-19 due to patient exposu re significantly decreased in the post-intervention period. Instituting universal masking decrea sed the re porte d rate per patient-day of 19 Last revised:4 July 2022 expos ure with out any (RR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14-0.55), showi ng the protective effect of surgical mask s in non-COVID-19 ca re spac es. This was not accompanied by a change i n the risk from aerosolizing procedures (Walker e t al., 2021). Transm ission to patients was also reduced in settings where univers al masking wa s included as part of an infection control bundle (Chang, Hur & Park, 2 020; Haber mann et al., 2021; Williams et al., 2021).). Haberm ann (2021) found no cases of nosocomial SARS -CoV-2 transmission among 1310 patients who tested negative at admission and completed serological testing following their hospital stay while a complete IPC bundle was in place. Similarly, in HCWs who were identifie d to be working during their period of communicability, only 3 patients tested positi ve for COVID-19 among 133 who completed follow up (2 14 eligible) (Williams et al., 2021). These findings su gges t that masks are an effective tool for limiting patient risk of infection due to HCW s. Three studies were identified that showed the risk of COV ID-19 infection in settings with low P PE c ompliance or no universa l mask policy wa s increased for HCWs in perceive d lower risk se ttings (such as non-COV ID-19 units, administrat ive settings, or break rooms) than in higher r isk se ttings (such as dedicat ed COV 2020; Cont ejean et al., preprint) showed that close contacts to colleagu es with out protection (su ch as during lunch) significantly in crease d the odds of SARS -CoV-2 infection. The higher-quality study, Contejean (preprint), rep orts a 2.6X (OR 2.58 [1.49-4.60]) i ncrease in infection odds in those who did not use masks, compared to those who did, when in close contact with colleagues. In addition, the cross -sectional st udy by Gohil (2021) found that forward transmission in three outbreaks occurred in non-patie nt care se ttings, such as in the breakroom, at the nursing station, and i n skills classes where masks we re less frequently wo rn (co mpared with other areas where masks we re used). Gohil (2020) also showed that working in a dedicat ed COV ID-19 unit, where a higher level of PPE was required at all times, was protective agains t infection - odds of COV ID-19 for workers on t hese units wa s 50% lower than for worke rs on non-COV ID-19 units (OR 0.53, CI = 0. 30-0.94, p = 0.03). Two studies showed that infection risk to healthcare wo rkers was increased largely due to home or community prevalence, rather than from hospital work i n settings with high PPE co mpliance or a universa l mask mandate (Bahrs et al., preprint; Belan et al., preprint). A case-control study by Belan (preprint) showed that the odds o f a HCW contra cting COV ID-19 in the community (where u niversa l masking is not enforced) were 9-fold higher t han the odds of an occupational exposure ((aO R 19.9 [12.4-31.9]). Howe ver, Belan (preprint) also showe d that eye protection and gowns were protective, which suggests confounding due to other factors su ch as behavi our vaccina tion. that tly associated with a COV ID-19 co ntact at home, rather than at work (OR 39.0 6, 95% CI 20 Last revised:4 July 2022 5.17 to 295.00), noting that self-reported PPE compliance among HCWs was 98% in high-risk areas and 70% in intermediate risk areas. Comm unity risk and occupati onal ri sk are difficult to disting uish in healthcare workers and are like ly confounded by behavi ours i n this populat ion. Three studies were identified that showe d the difference in COVID-19 in cidence in hospitals with a universa l mask policy co mpared with the COV ID-19 incidence in the community / general population (Contejean et al., 2021; Kociolek et al., 2021; Lan et al., 2020;; Chou et al., 2020).; Chou et al., 2022). Contejean (2021) i s the w eake st of the three studies, but showssho ws that when community CO VID-19 incidence is increasing, an in crease in HCW mask compliance is accompanied by decreasing COV IDCOV ID-19 ca se rates among HC Ws. This also show n by Kociole k (2021) in their quasi-experi mental study. In the pre-intervention period, the test positivity rates for HCWs and the community we re 18.4% and 10.7%, respective ly; wh ile in the post-intervention the positivity rates decrea sed to 9.0% for HCWs and increased to 12.8% in the community (Ko ciolek et al., 2021). Lan (2020) quantifies a similar phenom enon. In the pre-intervention phase, the occupational incid ence and community in cidence of COV ID-19 had overlapping slo pes (0.96 (0.80 to 1.13) and 0.99 (0 .92 to 1.07), res pectiv ely); in the post-intervention phas e, the community incidence slope continued to rise (0.99 (0.94 to 1.05)) while occupational incid ence slope decre ased (0.68 (1.06 to 0.31)). When the epidemic began to decline, the slopes once again overlapped (a lthough in the negative direction) (Lan et al., 2020). T his sugg ests universa l masking policies are effective for limiting hosp ital-base d transmission of SARS-CoV-2; this stu dy also may suggest that overall prevalence and abso lute risk of transmission may influence the absolute effectiveness of masking . Synthesis of the Information R elating to Question 1 While there are no randomized contro lled trials, and the quality of the available evidence is va riable, there is consist ency i n the results of included studies. This body of evidence sugges ts that infection control measures are associated wit h protection of both HCWs and patients from occupational exposu re to SARS -CoV-2. As noted above in the 'Strength of Evidence ' section, the specific im pact of universa l masking policies is difficult to isolate due to common implementation o f a bundle of infection co ntrol strategies and behaviours; risk of recall bias and so cial desir ability bias are also likely. The evidence was nearly entirely co llected in the early stages of the pandemic, before the availability and uptake of vaccines and emergence of subse quent variants. While unce rtainty exists, evidence supports that medical mask ing in health care se ttings reduces risk of transmission on the COV ID-19 respiratory virus. The relative benefit of any in tervention to reduce transmission of COV ID-19 wil l be modified by the absolute risk of transmission and s everity of subsequent infection. While low q uality, findings from Lan et al suggested that the impact of masking was 21 Last revised:4 July 2022 obse rvable in an epidemic phase but became undetectable as the epidemic wan ed. The benefit of a universa l mask policy therefore should be contextualized in the setting of abso lute risk (a nd benefit), consideratio n of possible negative consequences of masking, and other considerations as the acute phas e of the pandem ic wanes. Negative implications of masking include cost (in the setting of a publicly funded healt h care sy stem where efficient use of resources is important), and potential environmental impacts and impact of communication in healthcare (especially in hard-of-heari ng populations); previo us SAG revie ws have also reported on the potential harms arising from mask use and work co nduc ted in partnership with the CO VID-END consortium has shown that provisi on of sufficient PPE and organizat ional p olicies to keep HC Ws safe is an im portant part of mitigating staff burnout. Additio nally, the optics of a universa l mask policy are also importa nt - a face mask can remind staff, visitors, and patients that COV ID-19 (among other respiratory viruses) is still a risk that needs to be considered, and that other a ctivitie s (su ch as hand hygiene, physical d istancin g, and self-monitoring for sym ptoms) sh ould contin ue. From a workforce manage ment perspective, universa l masking policies may reduce the risk of other respiratory virus transmission in health care se ttings . The rates of influenza A, influenza B, and respiratory syn cytia virus were all zero betwe en February - April 2020 due to COV ID-19 in fection control practices (Wong et al., 2020). As respiratory illnesses return to circulation, a universa l masking policy may limit the number of HCW s who might require sick time due to illness, regardless of the respiratory virus. In the abse nce of a sympt om scre ening program fo r either vi sitors or staff, a universal mask policy ca n form part of a multi-modal stra tegy for protecting vulnerable populat ions in healt hcare settings. There is e vidence to suggest that the public health measures of the past two years have resulted i n \"imm unity debt\" that is a suspected cause of surging RSV cases (Hatter et al., 2021). There is a lso an argument to made for policy chan ge that allows a more local, tailored appro ach that can integrate transmissibility risk (co mmunity or HCW prevalence) as well as the consequenc es of transmission in specific patie nt populations - facilities or settings with a high proportion of vulnerable individuals (e g. long-term care or cancer care) at risk of severe conse quences with infection may derive more benefit from universa l masking policies compared to other settings (e.g. outpatient clinics that do not care for immunoc ompromised patients). What decisions around continuou s masking in healthcare facilities (both acute care and long-term care?) are being made elsewhere? Evidence from se condary and grey literature The Worl d Healt h Organizat ion states that using a face mask is a n effective and low cost strategy t o reducing the spread of COVID-19 (Worl d Health Organiza tion, 2022). 22 Last revised:4 July 2022 Mask m andates were implemented across Cana da in all public settings and have gradually been lifte d nationwi de through the spring of 2022. While masking mandates are no longer in effect for the general p ublic, there re mains required and re commended masking policy in healthcare se ttings across Canada. All Canadi an provin ces, except Ontario, currently re quire staff, visito rs, and desig nated supp ort persons to wear masks in most healthcare se ttings. Exceptions o ccur in non- clinical se ttings (such as administrat ive departments)) where p hysical distancing is in place, usually during periods o f 'low risk' for COV ID-19 transmission. Current Ontario policy offers recommendations (rather than requir ements) t hat allows each healt h care organization to establish their own masking policies (Publi c Healt h Ontario, 2022). Ontario's mandatory masking policy (including in hospitals) expired on June 11, 2022, howev er, long term care and retirem ent settings will contin ue to enforce mask use, and most health care institutions have implemented their own masking requirements (McKenz ie-Sutter, 2022). Similarly, in Alberta, the provincial mask mandate expired on June 14, 2022, and mask requirements in healt hcare se ttings shifted to an organizational policy by Alberta Health Services. There are only limited examples of private health care provid ers lifting mask mandates and indica ting mask use is optional. \"As a community healthcare facility, masks are enco uraged and available to all, includi ng wh en yo u first enter the clinic and during your a ppointment\" (Lifemark Health Group, 2022). T his juri sdictional sc an did not identify any Ontario hospitals that have changed masking requirements since the expiration o f the provincial mask mandate.. Table 1 provid es a summa ry of each provin ce's masking mandate, excepti ons f or health care se ttings and any health care wo rker s pecific policy (if available). Of note, the varying structures of the Ca nadian healthcare jurisdictions impact the ultimate penetration of the provin cial p olicy. For example, the provincial, highly integrat ed structure of AHS means that the masking policies will not differ across the provin ce; conversely, in Ontario, the large number of healt hcare organizat ions and fragmented private/public nature of long-term care facilities implies that the healthcare masking guidance could vary widely across the provin ce and across facilities. 23 Last revised:4 July 2022 Table 1.

Mandatory mask requirements were lifted on March 1, 2022 and removed for public trans it on June 14, 2022. Masking in Alberta Health Services and contracted health facilities has shifted to organ izational policy. Masking is still required in congregate care settings until June 30, 2022 (Governmen t of Alberta, 2022). Organizational policy. When entering an AHS facility, patients, designated family/support persons, and visitors shall be informed of the requirement for continuous masking and provided with a medical mask. Des ignated family/support persons and visitors in AHS facilities must wear a medical mask or their own KN95 or N95 respirator at all times. Adult inpatients do not require continuous masking in their bed space. Adult inpatients, when leaving their bed space or moving within other areas of the AHS facility, shall continuously mask. Adult patients in congregate care s ettings are no t required to mask within these settings unless otherwise required. Children are ex pected to wear masks in AHS facilities (Alberta H ealth Services, 2022) . AHS requires continuous masking by health care prov iders who work in AHS facilities or AHS settings when working in patient care areas ; providing direct patient care; in all areas of an AHS facility or AHS setting (both clinical and nonclinical). This includes any area w ithin an AHS facility or AH S setting where t here may be contact with patients, designated family/support persons, visitors, or the public or performing job duties while engaging with the public. Staff that work in areas with no direct contact with patients or patient items are r equired to we ar a mask continuously in all areas of their workplace unless they are at a work space separate d by at least two metres, separated by a physical barrier, or working alone in an individual office.

Summ arized from From: COVID Network Nova Scotia Health (2022) Ontario also uses a risk tier syst em to define masking protocols, but the specific metrics and thresholds are not descri bed. They advise using stricter policies when community incidence is high, using proxy metrics such as community positivity rate, wastewater surveillance , and disease severity (e.g. hosp italizations, ICU admissions) to assess community incidence (Publi c Healt h Ontario, 2022) Other Ju risdictions The European C entre for Disease Prevention and C ontro l advo cate (as of February 7, 2022) that face masks should be used to reduce community transmission of COV ID-19, particularly in confined space s such as on public transporta tion, wher e physical distancin g is not possible, in care se ttings, and for vulnerable people (and those interacting with them) (ECD C, 2022). According to the ECDC, most Europ ean c ountries have lifted general masking requirements with some exceptions (su ch as Germany, Italy 29 Last revised:4 July 2022 and Portu gal). Countries with persisting mask mandates are generally limited to confin ed sp aces (such as transit) and healthcare se ttings. Similar to Canada, mask mandates have been lifted in England (as of April 1, 2022), with exceptio ns including hosp itals and primary or community ca re settings, and those accessing or visiting care homes(Depart ment of Health and Social Ca re, 2021). In Wales and No rthern Ireland, use of a face mask in healt h care settings is strongly reco mmended (not required) (NI Direct Government Services, 2022; Welsh Governmen t, 2022). Currently in the United States, 14 States have required masking in specific se ttings, with 13 sp ecifying health care se ttings as a required site for mask use (Mendelson, 2022). I n States where mask use is 'reco mmended' so me healt hcare organizations have lifted masking requirements, particularly in non-clinical settings (Gamble, 2022). Despite this, the CDC advocates that all health care wo rkers sh ould use a mask (N95, l in a healt setting (Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention, 2022). In May 2022, the CDC further clarified that despite changes in masking guidance, \"staff, patie nts, residents and visit ors sh ould continue to wear masks as recommended in all healthcare facilities\" (American Hospital Association, 2022). Table 5 in the appendix provid es a summary of the United States that continue to require masking in healthcare and other settings. Synthesis of the Information R elating to Question 2 The jurisdiction al scan sugg ests that overall, healt h system decisi on-makers have contin ued universal mask policies that have been in place since 2020 and some jurisdiction s are developing data-base d risk assessment guidance documents. Howe ver, the metrics that might be used to inform a policy sh ift away from continuous masking were not clearly defined in the jurisdiction al scan. Nova Scotia is the most transparent with their guidance and gives concrete le vels of risk for rela xing mask use base d on community t est positivity rate (although the evidence upon which this was base d was not identifi ed in the publi cly available documents). The United States CDC uses the following in dicators to determine the co mmunity level of COV ID-19 (Tab le 3) (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022b). These indicators and thresholds can be used to inform the st ringency of public health recommendations to the populat ion. At low levels, the emphasis rest s on vaccina tion, ventila tion, testing, and isolation; at medium levels, additional prevention steps are taken to protect vulnerable populations; at high le vels, even more active measures are implemented (such as universa l masking) to protect all indivi duals and co mmunities (Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention, 2022b). T his framework can also inform the behaviours recommended to indivi duals and the supporting public health strategies (Centers for Disease Contro l and Prevention, 2022b). 30 Last revised:4 July 2022 Table 3. Indicators and thresholds used to determine community levels of COVID-19. The higher of new COVID-19 admissions and percent of occup ied beds is combined with the daily new CO VID-19 cases to generate an estimate of circulating COVID-19 in the community.

Although researc h focused heavil y on the effectiveness of different types of masks a nd mask policies at the beginning of the pandemic, IPC interests shifted to other to pics after masks were wid ely adopted. There is no direct evidence on mask policies that relates to highly tra nsmissible variants of conce rn, high levels of community transmission, or masks in highly vaccina ted populations. 31 Last revised:4 July 2022 Appe ndix List of Abbreviations AHS: Alberta Health Services AI: Accumulated Incidence AR: Attributable Risk CDC: Un ited S tates Cente Coro navir us Disea se 2019 ECDC: European er for Disease Contr ol HCW: Healthcare Worker IPC: Infection Prevention and Co ntrol OR: Odds Ratio PPE: Person al Protective Equipment RR: Risk Ra tio RT-PCR: Reve rse Grou VOC: Variant of Concern 32 Last revised:4 July 2022 Evidence Extraction Table Table 4.

Narrative overview of the literature included in this revie w. Description 48 Last revised:4 July 2022 Volume 1 syste matic review was included (0 were pre-revie w); 4 prospectiv e cohort st udies were included (1 were pre-revie w); 2 retrospective cohort studies were included (0 were pre-revie w), 3 case-contro l studies were included tive obse 6 pre-/post-intervention descri ptive studies were included; 1 case series was include d. Quality In general, the evidence identified and included from the primary literature wa s overall of low q uality. The studies with a clear quantitative methodology (eg. the cohort studies, case-contro l, and quasi -experimental studies) were generall y of reasonable quality; howeve r, the outbreak investigation re ports w ere low quality. The epidemiological in vestigati on re ports o ften used HCW self-report methods and retrospective surveys to assess PPE u se among the study population. These methods are at high risk of recall bias and social d esirability bias, which may result in an overestimate of the effectiveness of the intervention. The observational methodologies in the body of evidenc e are insufficient to show the effect of universal ma sking . In most cases, there wa s no controlled comparator group to show th e effect of masks specifica lly. The hospitals whe re universa l masking was implemented often concurrently in troduce d a suite of IPC measu res that interact to protect individuals in the hospital (eg. enhanced cle aning measures; enhance d scre ening, testing, isolation procedures; social distancin g measures; gathering re strictions; and visit or restriction). In many cases, these additional interventions w ere not adjusted in the analysi s and in troduce a very high risk of confounding in these studies. In the case of outbreak investigations, the introducti on of masks may be accompanied by increased s taff aware ness of circulating COV ID- 19, which may introduce prevention behavio urs that aren't accounted for in the analysi s and further confounding the results. Applicability The included evidence was nearly entirely collected during 2020, when the efficacy of masks was still under debate and universa l masking policies were conside red a major policy re sponse to the pandemic. Since masks have become generall y acceptable and no hospital has publi shed the re sults of lifting their universa l masking policy, no new 49 Last revised:4 July 2022 evidence has been published to confirm the effectiveness of mask policies in the face of high community transmission , COV ID-19 variants of concern, and high vaccination rates among healthcare worke rs. In addition , every jurisdiction experi enced the start of the pandemic in a different way. Alberta, for example, had a very mild first wave that resulted i n fewer than 10000 re porte d cases; by comparison, New York C ity and Northern Italy experienced high caseloads t hat overwhelm ed healthcare resources. Diffe rences in community transmission and publi c health measures may also impact the effectiveness of a hospital mask mandate. Consistency The collected evidence is ve ry co nsistent - every includable article reports that universa l masking policies are an effective tool to limit COV ID-19 sp read wit hin a hosp ital setting. 50 Last revised:4 July 2022 Searc h Strategy Ovid MEDLINE(R) ALL 1946 to June 09, 2022 # Sear ches Results 1 exp masks/ or respiratory protective devices/ 14153 2 (mask o r masks or respiratory protective device* or KN9 5 or FFP2 or FFP3 or N95 ntact precautio ns\" or E-RCP or respiratory protection* or filtering face piece* or filtering facepiece*).kf,ti. or (mask or masks or respiratory protective device* or KN95 or FFP2 or FFP3 or E-RCP *).ab. corona viru* or ncov* or n-cov* or novel cov* or COVID-19 COVID19 or COVID-2019 or COVID2019 or SARS-CoV-2 or SARSCoV or or severe acute respiratory syn drome coronaviru* or severe acute respiratory syn drome cov 2 or 2019 ncov or 2019ncov).kf, exp academic medical Hospital/ 82521 9 (hospital or hospitals or long t erm care or nursing home* or acute care or hosp ital unit* or room* or h?emodialysis unit* or intensive care unit* or burn u nits* o r coronary ca re unit* o r intensive care unit* o r recovery room* or respiratory care unit* or ng st ation* or operating room* or self-care unit* or ER or ED o r emergency department*).kf,ti. or (hospital or hosp itals or long term care or nursi ng home* or acute care or r intensive care unit* or burn units* or coronary ca re unit* or intensive care unit* or recovery room* or respiratory care unit* or nursing station* or operating room* or self-care unit* or ER o r ED d epart ment*).ab. /freq=2 926722 10 or/6-9 1247897 11 4 and 5 and 10 512 12 Disease Outbreaks/ 87970 13 Cross Infection/ 60242 14 Infection Last revised:4 July 2022 15 (outbreak* or cross infection* or health care associated or cross infection* or health care associated in fection* or healthcare 275723 19 11 and 18 210 20 limit 19 to (english language and yr=\"2020 -Current\") 191 21 remove duplicates from 20 189 CINAHL Query Limiters/Expander s Results Expan ders -
