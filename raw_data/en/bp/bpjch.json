There are many nutrient forms, produced with a variety of processes. Some of the most popular nutrient forms available in supplements today include: Whole Food Concentrates Whole food vitamin and mineral supplements are sourced from fruits, vegetables, herbs and mushrooms. They include natural cofactors that make food nutrients so easy for the body to absorb and utilize. However, they do require extensive processing and may be made with GMOs, mass agriculture and dirty eco-destructive practices. Isolated Chemical (USP) Nutrients Isolated Chemical (USP) is the cheapest vitamin and mineral form found in the most basic multivitamin supplements. This synthetic form chemically alters vitamins and minerals, isolating them from their whole-food cofactors. As a result, Isolated Chemical (USP) nutrients are typically harder to absorb and less effective than whole food nutrients. Chelated Minerals In this process, a mineral nutrient (such as iron, calcium, zinc) is bound with a chelator: An organic molecule (often an amino acid) that is large enough to enrobe the mineral. By surrounding the mineral, the chelator protects it against degradation. Chelated nutrients are highly stable and may improve nutrient uptake and utilization. NutriGenesis\u00ae is different from traditional nutrient forms: Bioengineered to be better. NutriGenesis\u00ae are cultured nutrients that replicate the creation of vitamins, minerals and aminos in nature. NutriGenesis\u00ae is based on the work of Nobel Prize-winning physiologist Albert Szent Gyorgy, who theorized that nutrients presented in their naturally grown forms supply cofactors that make them more bioavailable, biologically active and effective than nutrients that are isolated. In the NutriGenesis\u00ae process, single-cell organisms are seeded with micronutrients in a hydroponic growth medium. The live single-cell organisms \"eat\" the micronutrients, divide and thrive. As the cultures grow, they produce fresh new NutriGenesis\u00ae vitamins, minerals and aminos within a matrix of natural cofactors. This familiar structure is more easily absorbed and utilized by the body. [ More on the NutriGenesis\u00ae Process ](/pages/nutrigenesis) NutriGenesis\u00ae advantages over other forms: NutriGenesis\u00ae is essentially food nutrition. Mirroring food nutrients molecule-by-molecule, our vitamins, minerals and aminos are presented in pure elemental form. Maximum nutrition: Nothing more, nothing less. Enhanced effectiveness. Because NutriGenesis\u00ae nutrients are in food-matrix form, they are recognized by the body as nature-identical -- maximizing nutrient uptake, bioavailability and beneficial activity. Patented and researched. The patented process behind NutriGenesis\u00ae has been shown in research to enhance nutrient absorption and retention (when compared to chemical isolates). Cleaner and safer. NutriGenesis\u00ae is produced in a sterile, tightly controlled lab setting. NutriGenesis\u00ae is minimally processed, requiring no pesticides, herbicides or other synthetics associated with some other whole-food nutrients. Better for the planet: The NutriGenesis\u00ae process is clean and efficient, with little carbon footprint or environmental impact - especially when compared to factory farming for phytonutrients and strip mining for minerals.
