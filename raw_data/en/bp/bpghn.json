The book is organized around nineissues in nine chapters, each of which is an Integral part of adistrict planning cycle. The opening three chapters show how toassess the existing district health system in terms of nationalpolicies and support, analysis of the current system, and evaluationof district priorities. Chapters 4 through 7 focus on actions to betaken. The initial task of setting goals is discussed using examplesand establishing general categories. The book next treats the actionprogram including curative services, maternal and child health andhealth promotion, and prevention and control of disease. The nextchapter focuses on the increase in program effectiveness broughtabout by joint action of families, individuals, and communities.Chapter 7 discusses key issues pertaining to good operationalmanagement. The final two chapters focus on monitoring (i.e., the useof tracer diseases and sentinel sites) and tips for evaluatinginterventions and learning from experience.

Through this organization, which was created in 1946, the healthprofessions of some 165 countries exchange their knowledge and experi-ence with the aim of making possible the attainment by all citizens of theworld by the year MOO of a level of health that will permit them to leada socially and economically productive life.By means of direct technical cooperation with its Members States, andby stimulating such cooperation among them, WHO promotes the develop-ment of comprehensive health services, the prevention and control ofdiseases, the improvement of environmental conditions, the development ofhealth manpower. the coordination and development of biomedical andhealth services research, and the planning and implementation of healthprogrammes. These broad fields of endeavour encompass a wide variety of activities.such as developing systems of primary health care that reach the wholepopulation of Member countries; promoting the health of mothers and children; combating malnutrition; controlling malaria and other com-municable diseases including tuberculosis and leprosy; having achieved theeradication of smallpox, promoting mass immunization against a number ofother preventable diseases; improving mental health; providing safe watersupplies; and training health personnel of all categories.Progress towards better health throughout the world also demandsinternational cooperation in such matters as establishing international standards for biological substances, pesticides and pharmaceuticals:formulating environmental health criteria; recommending international non-proprietary names for drugs; administering the International Health Regula-tions; revising the International Classification of Diseases, Injuries. andCauses of Death: and collecting and disseminating health statistical in- formation.

While most countries have formulated broadpolicies, strategies and plans for achieving the goal, the implementation of these plans is often weak. The current efforts of numerous agencies andsectors to extend health care will succeed only if each district can identify itsown priorities and target the available resources to the individuals, families,communities, and other population groups who are underserved or at risk.The need to adopt a population approach and to identify the target groups forhealth programmes is the point of departure of the present publication.The ideas presented here are based on a number of years' experience asa district health manager, as well as on extensive discussions and consulta-tions with colleagues both within and outside WHO. I am particularlygrateful to Dr G. Fowkes, Department of Community Medicine, Universityof Edinburgh, Edinburgh, Scotland, and Dr Asamoah Baah, Ministry ofHealth, Accra, Ghana, for their helpful suggestions, as well as to the manyindividuals who commented on the early drafts of this book. E. Tarimo c.) Introduction In May 1977, the Member States of the World Health Organization adopted the goal of \"Health for all by the year 2000\". If this goal is to be achieved, the people who do not currently have access to appropriate health carethose still missing from the \"all\" in \"health for alr must be identified, and services must be developed to meet their needs. The most practical unit for doing this is the district, wheregiven coordination by means of good planning and managementhealth professionals auxiliaries, workers from other sectors, and community memberscan assume collective responsibility for the healthof the community. Unfortunately, this team potential is seldom realized. District plans are often poorly formulated or non-existent, targets are vague, and efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of services are seldom considered. The activities of variousprogrammes and institutions continue to be piece-meal and poorly coordinated, while health services are concentrated in particular areas, leaving large population groups with little or no access to health care.This publication is concerned primarily with orienting health care workers in district health systems in developing countries to ways and means of overcoming problems, and describes briefly how district health systems can be improved. It is not meant to be a comprehensive or detailed manual, but rather a stimulus to action and to the acquisition of skills for the improvement of district health systems.It is addressed primarilyto those directly concerned with improving health within a defined population, and particularly to members of district health management teams. It should also be relevant to provincial, national, and international institutions concerned with the role of primary healthcare in improving health. In examining the organization andmanagement of district health systems, the book focuses on nine issues, each of which is an integral part ofa district planning cycle (Fig. I), and which address thefollowing sets of questions:Does the country have national policies, strategies and plans of action for health for all? Are support and guidance provided to districts? 1 1 Towards a healthy district Evaluation andlearning-by-doing Monitoring ImplementationNational policiesand actionrograrnme improvinghealth services4Fig. i. The district planning cycle Are basic data on the characteristics of the population, level of health,major health problems and coverage with essential health care readilyavailable in the district?Have district priorities been appraised?Have objectives and targets for health and health care been set?Does the district have an action plan for important programmes such ashealth promotion, maternal and child health, school health, environ-mental sanitation, occupational health, control of diseases and curativeservices?Are there effective mechanisms to get everyone communities,health-related sectors, nongovernmental organizations and the varioushealth programmesto work together?Are there adequate resources, incentives, logistics and organizationalarrangements to ensure prompt implementation of programmes?Are activities monitored and controlled regularly? Is there a mechan-ism for quality assurance? 2 Introduction !El -4 A health worker in the Philippines adds another piece to the jigsaw of a nation's health Photo WHO/Zafar (19938)Is periodic evaluation carried out? Are efforts made to find solutions toproblems encountered?If the answer to most of these questions is \"yes\" for a given district, it isalready well on the way towards becoming a healthy district. If not, this bookprovides suggestions and pointers as to what could be done to improve thesituation.Some definitionsWhat is a district?The district is the most peripheral fully organized unit of local government andadministration. It differs greatly from country to country in size and degree ofautonomy, and population may vary from less than 5o 000 to over 300000.It is geographically compact and every part of it can normally be reachedwithin a day. As a unit, it is small enough for the staff to understand the major problems and constraints of socioeconomic and health development, and for 1 1 3 Toward* a healthy dlistrict health and other workers to know each other and be more humane in theirapproach. It is also a large enough unit for the development of the technicaland managerial skills essential for planning and management. There isusually a central administrative point where the main government sectors arerepresented. The district is often the natural meeting-point for \"bottom-up\"planning and organization and \"top-down\" planning and support and is, there-fore, a place where community needs and national priorities can be reconciled.The district offers great opportunities for effective intersectoral action,since it is an area within which bodies such as development committees anddistrict councils can very easily plan and act in unison. At district level, awayfrom rigid central divisions and bureaucracies, different sectors have alwaystended to work together and people find it easy to collaborate on specificissues. The constitutional, legal, political, and administrative structures willdetermine the degree to which responsibilities will be decentralized. Thesestructures also influence the amount of community participation through, forexample, representative assemblies or other established mechanisms for thehwolvement of citizens in public matters.What is a health system?\"A health system is the complex of interrelated elements that contribute tohealth in homes, educational institutions, workplaces, public places andcommunitier, as well as in the physical and psychosocial environment and thehealth and related sectors\" (r).What is a district health system?A district health system based on primary health care is a more or lessself-contained segment of the national health system. It comprises first andforemost \"a well-defined population living within a clearly delineated admin-istrative and geographical area. It includes all the relevant health care ac-tivities in the area, whether governmental or otherwise. It therefore consistsof a large variety of interrelated elements that contribute to health in homes,schools, workplaces, communities, the health sector, and related social andeconomic sectors. It includes self-care and all health care personnel andfacilities, whether governmental or nongovernmental, up to and includingthe hospital at the first referral level, and the appropriate support services,such as laboratory, diagnostic, and logistic support. It wipe most effective ifcoordinated by an appropriately trained health officer WOrking to ensure ascomprehensive a range as possible of promotive, preventive, curative, andrehabilitative health activities (2), 4 .12 Introduction The network of manpower and facilities providing health care at districtlevel varies greatly from country to country. At the most peripheral level ofcontact between the community and the organized health service, there arehealth units bearing different names in different countries: dispensary, clinic,health post, health centre, health subcentre, general practitioner's office, etc.Somewhere in the district, usually in the main town, there is a districthospital. There may also be other hospitals, often belonging to nongovern-mental organizations, such as missions and societies. Within the communityitself, there may be community health workers. Also, many individuals,families, groupings within communities, and other sectors will be involved inhealth care activities.What is primary health care?The expression \"primary health care\" has traditionally been used to meanthe first-level contact between patients or communities and organized healthcare. In this sense, it includes the services provided by peripheral healthworkers, including general practitioners, nurses, and health auxiliaries. TheInternational Conference on Primary Health Care, held at Alma-Ata in 1978,used the expression to convey two other meanings: essential health careconsisting of at least eight elements (see Fig. 2), and an approach to theprovision of health care that is characterized by equity, intersectoral action,and community participation. It is essentially to these two last meanings thatthe expression now commonly refers. FoodsupplyHealthand propereducationnutrition and childdiseasescareandinturies WHO 907 f.5Fig. 2. The eight elements of primary health care (PHC)3 5 CHAPTER 1National policies and support There remain many decisions to be taken and activities to be carried out bygovernments to bring about necessary changes in district health care. In-equities in health and health care still prevail in many parts of the world. Inspite of being committed to the goal of health for all, some countries have notas yet defined the relevant policies and plans of action, while others haveproduced quite in idequate ones. National plans of action must institute a fairdistribution of a sources and programmes throughout the country, withpreferential ailocztion to underserved districts. They should also providea framework for districts so that their action programmes meet their needs.The objectives of primary health care can only be achieved if each sectormakes an appropriate contribution. For this to happen effectively, a mech-anism for intersectoral coordination and cooperation must be established,and this is where the central government comes in. The minister of healthcould, for instance, prepare a document for the cabinet suggesting possibleways and means of ensuring the desired coordination. These might include,at central level, a subcommittee of the cabinet and, at district level, a subcom-mittee of the district development committee. Legislation may be required toset up such mechanisms at government level.The existence in the ministry of health of a high-level committee or focalpoint for the support of primary health care can bring about more generalsupport, and an increasing number of countries are developing high-levelcoordinating networks to support the implementation of primary health care.These have different names in different countries, for example, nationalprimary health care implementation committee, national health council, etc.These networks bring together representatives of nongovernmental organiza-tilns, professional associations, and technical institutions. Collaborative net- works involving technical institutes, such as universities, social scienceinstitutes, and management and administration centres, might he set up for the same pi: rpose.In countries where the administrative system has been decentralizt d todistrict level, the development of district health systems is greatly facilitated.Elsewhere, progressive decentralization should be targetedso many dis- tricts by 1992, so many by 1993, etc.Financial delegation to the district is the key factor in providing oppor- tunities for change to be initiated within the district according to local 614 National polleas and support circumstances. Decentralization without delegation of appropriate financialdecisions does not work. There is also a need to ensure political commitmentinside districts to fiscally and socially responsible management.Decentralization requires, first, better trained health managers at districtlevel, secondly, a health team approach, and thirdly, planning support fromthe central authority in the form of guidelines and advisory staff.Political commitment will have to be buttressed by economic support.Government expenditure on health programmes in many developing coun-tries seldom exceeds z\u00b0 of the gross national product. The small sum spentper capita is an important contributory factor in the poor coverage of publichealth services. Efforts will have to be made to gain the backing of economicplanners at both central and district levels. To this effect, it will be necessaryto prepare a properly costed financial master-plan. Where further increasesare not possible, alternative ways of financing district health systems, includ-ing cost-sharing, have to be considered.In order to improve district health systems, a managerial process will haveto be established and used at both central and district levels. In the districts,this process should bc sensitive and responsive to epidemiological patterns inthe community, as well as to local cultural habits pertaining to health. cz,:f 71,e VAir The medical officer in charge of provincial health services meets with village elders inThailand Photo WHO/A S.

Specific support should be offered by the centrallevel in the following areas. Planning and managementCentral authorities can: 8set out clearly how national health objectives and health service targetsmay be translated into district objectives and targets and vice versa,thus helping district staff to set their own objectives more easily;identify the priority areas to which extra resources should be allo-cated, thus assisting the district staff in their own determination ofpriorities;provide experts in demography, epidemiology, etc. on a short-termbasis to assist district staff in analysing and setting priorities until theyhave gained the numerical and other skills required to conduct a situ-ational analysis (such expertise should be provided only until local staffare proficient in the relevant tasks);initiate training programmes in planning at district level, for example,short courses held at a national centre or locally, or in-service trainingwhile district staff are in the process of planning future activities (theaim should be to enable staff to make competent district plans withoutthe assistance of outside experts);provide extra resources for these initiatives, or attempt to obtain them,on behalf of districts, from nongovernmental and other sources;provide examples of simple indicators and methods of recording, ag-gregating and analysing data to obtain useful information;provide guidelines on budgeting, cost analysis, and cost control;provide guidelines on technical issues, including appropriate ways ofcontrolling important diseases.I e; National policies and support Joint actionIn addition to forming national coordinating committees, central authoritiescan encourage community participation, intersectoral collaboration, and tht:-.integration of vertical programmes in districts by:organizing more joint action at the national level, because this often leads to similar joint ventures lower down the system;providing earmarked resources at district level to encourage joint action;attempting to change the attitudes of health service staff and the general public regarding primary health carefor example through the mass media.

Photo WHO/UN (79135) 17BEST COPY AVAILABLE9 CHAPTER 2Analysis of the presentsituation District planning is crucial if primary health care is to be improved. Becausethe population and geographical area of a district are of a manageable size, theinformation needed for planning will be relatively easy to obtain. In addition,communication and change will be easier because staff within the district willoften know one another personally.For an analysis of the present situation in the district, data on thefollowing are required: population; health indicators; deployment of re-sources; and coverage. Thisinformation, which is the basis for appraisingdistrict priorities, setting programme objectives and targets, and specifyingthe measures to be taken, should provide an insight into overall health needsand make it possible to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses of the existingdistrict health system and how it can be improved. Data can be gathered fromroutine information collected by health workers in their day-to-day work,reports of studies previously carried out in the area, and census data. Localdata rather than national statistics should be used as much as possible.Incomplete data should not be discarded since they may prove useful if\"enriched\" and carefully interpreted. Special surveys may provide moreaccurate information (for example, on disease incidence and prevalence), butthey are expensive and time-consuming. They should be resorted to onlywhere better estimates are likely to lead to a change in policies and plans.The district health team should assess in some detail the major healthproblems in the district and the extent to which care programmes areovercoming them. Both \"strong\" and \"deprived\" areas of the district shouldbe identified.PopulationWhere do the people live? Is this likely to affect health care coverage andutilization? How big are various population groups, i.e., the under-fives,children aged 5-14, women of childbearing age (15-44 years)? Table ishowshow such information can be summarized.Variations in population size between subdistricts will show what areasmay need additional healthfacilities. The age structure of the population willhelp in determining the types of service required. The extent of urbanization 10IS Analysis at the preunt situation Table 1. Presentation of information on a district's popu-lation, by subdistrict and given are for purposes of illustration only.will indicate whether there is a need to develop urban-oriented primaryhealth care (3).Data on socioeconomic factors such as income, occupation, and educa-tional level, which have a strong bearing on health status and health serviceutilization, should also be included.Information on the following should bc obtained for selected years: crudebirth rate (CBR), expected annual number of births (CBR x total popula-tion), crude death rate, and population growth rate. Further parameters aregiven in Table 2.Health indicatorsThe types of data listed in Table 2 can provide important information forcomparative purposes, but are frequently not available at the district level. Itis useful, therefore, to obtain approximate figures or, at least, to discoverwhether rates are higher or lower than the national averages. At the locallevel, there are usually sources of data that can be consulted, e.g., morbiditydata can be obtained from hospitaT or health centre registers.

It reflects not only the prevalence ofdiseases immediately responsible for death, such as malaria, pneumonia, anddiarrhoea, but also the general level of the maternal and child health services,the health of mothers, literacy, environmental sanitation, and the degree ofsocioeconomic development. Data should bc analysed to determine the mostfrequent causes of death and ill-health, and trends over the previous fiveyears. Are trends in the district different from national trends?In addition to indices of mortality and morbidity, information may beobtained on the prevalence of certain risk factors for disease. For example,what proportion of the population obtains water from a clean supply? Howmany women do not breast-feed their infants? How many children are notfully immunized? What proportion of the population is malnourished or doesnot have access to adequate food? What proportion of the population livesnear rivers and is at risk from onehocerciasis? How many people useschistosome-infested lakes? What proportion of the population smokescigarettes or abuses alcohol? An assessment of the prevalence of risk factors inthe community is important for deciding on preventive measures. 12 2 Analysis ot the present situation Deployment of resourcesIs the number of health facilities in the district sufficient to allow for thesatisfactory implementation of primary care activities? Data on the popula-tion having access to facilities within the district can be presented in tabularform as in Table 3, or by means of maps as in Fig. 3. The percentage of thepopulation living within, say, one hour's walk or travel should be worked outfor each facility. This information will point to the areas that should be givenpriority as regards new facilities.Table 3.

Are there separate units andstaff for the different elements of primary health care? Do the hospitals,health centres, and other facilities have a defined geographical area of respons-ibility? What is their outreach to communities? What proportion of house-holds is covered by community health workers through outreach activities?An assessment of these aspects will indicate deficiencies in the organization ofservices and possible corrective action.Are there intersectoral coordinating bodies at district and village level?How effective are they? What mechanisms exist to facilitate communityparticipation? Information on these subjects will make it possible to decidehow existing mechanisms can be strengthened and whether new ones areneeded.Is the number of health personnel sufficient to provide adequate coverageof the population? What are the national norms? What percentage of estab-lished posts are filled? What is their distribution/concentration within thedistrict by type? Are there too many of one category and not enough ofothers? If there are community health workers, what are their roles? Does thelevel of district staff approach national staffing targets? Do the staff have jobdescriptions? What training and in-service orientation programmes are pro-vided? Are these adequate? Are there appropriate supervisory arrangements?Is staff morale high? If there is a shortage of drugs, which drugs are affectedand what are the underlying reasons? Assessment of these aspects willindicate deficiencies in the organization of services and stimulate correctiveaction. FinancesThe distribution of finances within the district needs to be determined andalternative ways found of using available finances equitably. Data are oftendeficient and an ad hoc survey may be necessary. Is the per capita healthexpenditure in the district comparable with national per capita health ex-penditure? Is there a fee-for-service or other form of cost-recovery scheme inthe district? How much money was generated in this way during the last fiscalyear? What support is provided by outside agencies? How have funds tythenallocated within the district between capital (investment) and recurrent(operating) items, between facilities, and for manpower? To what extent haveallocated funds been used in terms of both recurrent and capital expenditure?(See Table 4.) 14 Analysts at the present ettuetten Table 4. Presentation of district information should also be obtained:Estimated financial support (separate capital and recurrent items) fromother sources such as nongovernmental organizations, private inter-prise, and parastatal organizations.Cost by facility (i.e., recurrent costs for salaries, drugs, etc.).Cost per contact (i.e., average cost for each outpatient attendance orinpatient stay).Proportion of recurrent budget allocated to hospitals compared withother services.CoverageCoverage is a measure of the extent to which a population entitled toa particular service, such as antenatal care or immunization, actually gets it.Coverage data should be obtained for each health facility in the subdistricts,for maternal and child health, water supply, environmental sanitation, andother services having a bearing on health. The following are examples ofindicators that could be used:Percentage of mothers attending at least one consultation with trainedhealth personnel during the antenatal period.Percentage of mothers attended at childbirth by trained personnel.Percentage of mothers assessed for risk factors.23 15 Towards a haafthy district Percentage of eligible children immunized against diphtheria, tetanus,pertussis, measles, poliomyelitis, and tuberculosis.Percentage of children subject to regular growth monitoring.Percentage of population having safe water within 15 minutes' walkingdistance.Percentage of population with sanitary facilities in the house or itsimmediate neighbourhood.Percentage of population that is literate, with separate data for malesand for females.Percentage of population having a certain minimum number of con-tacts with services and/or community health workers per year (e.g.,two per person per year).

Vohra (19120) 16BEST COPY AVAILABLE Analysis ot the present situation The goal of coverage analysis is to identify population groups or geo-graphical areas that are underserved, with a view to introducing appropriateremedial measures. Coverage data are most useful when presented by sub-district and by recognizable population groups. Analysis of such data, inconjunction with data on finance, deployment of resources, health indicators,and population, can help pinpoint what changes have to be introduced inthese areas in order to meet the health needs of the district. For example, ifa subdistrict has a comparatively high infant mortality rate, and an insuffi-cient number of antenatal care and other services, a redeployment of re-sources in favour of such services should be planned.Urban primary health careWhile primary health care applies the same principles in both rural and urbanpopulations, the urban situation has certain special features, including rapidpopulation increase, a high concentration but limited accessibility of healthfacilities and services, and the diversity of urban communities. In thesecircumstances it is essential to use the available resources efficiently andequitably by concentrating on disease prevention and the elimination ofenvironmental health problems. Health education and promotion should bestressed. This calls for innovative ways of identifying and reaching groups atrisk in slums and periurban areas. 17 CHAPTER 3Appraisal of district priorities Resources for health care being invariably limited, choices have to be madeas to the diseases, population groups, geographical areas, and programmesthat require attention. Priorities may be chosen for various political, social,economic, and health reasons. One must not delude oneself into thinking thatthe choice can be based solely on valid scientific evidence and that there are\"right\" and \"wrong\" decisions. Priorities will vary locally and must be basedon reasonable consensus, ideally with the participation of community leaders.Fig. 4 depicts the health systems \"cube\". It is obvious that each of the four\"dimensions\" functional infrastructure, community involvement and in-tersectoral collaboration, level of service delivery, and primary health careelementscan be used as a framework for setting priorities.

Priority should thereforebe given to strengthening the functional infrastructure. As regards popula-tion groups. the aim should be to give priority attention to those found to beat special risk.Various techniques, such as scoring systems, should be viewed simply asmethods of organizing the process of choosing priorities so that all theappropriate issues (such as costs) are considered. But adding togetherweights for different parameters (e.g., costs and effectiveness) is not alwaysa good way of reaching a final decision. The chart below (Tabl- 5) can beused to organize the choice of health priorities, with each parameter scored Table 5.

For example, nutrition programmes mayreduce not only the incidence of kwashiorkor, marasmus, and other diseasesdirectly attributable to poor nutrition, but also the mortality and morbidityassociated with infectious diseases. Assessing the cost-benefit of such pro-grammes is, however, not easy, precisely because of the variety of benefitsthat might ensue.Targeting the elements of primary health careThe Dec las, ation of Alma-Ata defined primary health care as consisting of atleast eight elements (see Fig. 2,p. 5). Many questions have been raised aboutthese elements, deemed by some insufficient and by others too numerous. 4.4 112witwilLikoz_ \"At-% In a West Sumatran village, a little house indicated by painted initials brings under oneroof a whole series of health care programmes carried out at village level. Photo WHO/UNICEFIM. Black (18905).2BEST COPY AVAILABLE21 Towards a healthy distTict The latter would prefer to concentrate on just two or three elements thatappear particularly \"ripe\" for concerted action because of the availability ofappropriate low-cost technology and because interventions in the areas con-cerned are likely to have a considerable impact on health.In practice, the eight elements constitute a set of tasks, none of whichshould be neglected. The aim at district level should be to carry out essentialactivities in respect of each of the eight elements, within the constraints ofavailable resources, rather than providing greater support for programmesdealing with only one or a few elements. The details (depth and content) ofthis task will vary from country to country. Cancer and cardiovasculardiseases, for example, are very prevalent in the developed countries andconsidered of great importance, so that considerable resources go into pro-viding sophisticated curative care for those who suffer from them. Thedeveloping countries, however, cannot afford to provide a similar type ofcare, but primary prevention of these diseases by promoting healthybehaviourphysical exercise and abstinence from smoking, for exampleisfeasible in all countries. 3 :22 CHAPTER 4Setting objectives and targets Once priorities have been formulated, the next step is to specify goals.However, these goals may need frequent revision during planning and pro-gramme implementation, particularly because of the constraints imposed bylack of resources. In theory, one should start setting objectives by specifyingthe degree of improvement desired in respect of each health problem andthen determining the appropriate level of service coverage (the operationaltarget) needed in order to achieve it. In practice, however, it is not possible toset a realistic health objective for a given disease without at the same timeconsidering all the other health priorities. Priority health problems shouldtherefore be grouped together, from the service standpoint, to facilitate thesetting of objectives and targets (e.g., all diseases preventable by vaccinationcould be considered as one group, as could all antenatal health problems) (4).Goals can be expressed as health improvement objectives, operationaltargets, and health infrastructure targets.Health improvement objectives should indicate:the health problem or risk factor to be addressed;specified changes in the health problem or risk factor;target date! ;the target population. Here are some examples of health improvement objectives:A specified reduction in infant mortality rate and maternal mortalityrate by(specify date).A specified reduction in morbidity rates from endemic diseases such asmeasles and malaria by (specify date).A specifiedreduction in malnutrition ratesinthe under-fivesby(specify date). 3123 Towards a healthy district 24A specified reduction in disparity in health status in different parts ofthe district by(specify date).A specified reduction in percentage of children of a specified age withdental caries by(specify date).A specified increase in percentage of population with a healthy life-style, e.g., practising breast-feeding, abstaining from smoking, etc.by(specify date).

Setting *actives and targets Setting targets for health in Norwayin November 1985, a conference was held in Norway to discusschallenges to planning after the decentralization of primary healthservices to local municipalities. During this conference, the Ministerfor Social Affairs for the first time publicly declared Norway's commit-ment to the health for all strategy and also stated that the Governmentwould prepare a national health plan.Subsequently, the National Association of Municipalities, withsupport from the Directorate of Health and the Ministry of SocialAffairs, prepared a series of conferences aimed at adapting the healthfor all policy to activities at the district level and providing the coun-tries and municipalities with a new planning tool based on health forall principles.The basic features of the national health policy are as follows:1. Twelve problem areas have been identified on the basis ofepidemiological studies; and twelve targets established ac-cordingly:- to reduce inequities in health care- to develop and make use of health potentialto reduce the amount of disability- to reduce the incidence of specific diseases- to increase life expectancy- to reduce infant mortalityto reduce maternal mortalityto reduce mortality from diseases of the circulatorysystem- to reduce mortality from cancer- to reduce deaths from accidentsto reverse the upward trend in the suicide rate.2. These targets cannot be achieved by work within the healthsystem alone Five areas of concern have been identified:the health care systemlife-stylesenvironmental risksinformation and researchpolitical support.(Cootolued overlobit) 3 5 27 Towards a healthy district 3. Six basic principles have to be kept in mind at all times toprevent contradictions within the system:equitycommunity participationhealth promotionmultisectoral cooperationinternational cooperationconcentration on primary health care.4. Within each area of concern there are specific objectives, theachievement of which will contribute to the realization of theultimate targets. Three methods of work are common to allareas of concern, namely:informationcooperation or network-buildingresource allocation.Within this framework, Norway has started a process of jointplanning by the central authorities and the municipalities, and byhealth providers and health consumers. The process starts from thevantage point of the group targeted for improvement. It is at the locallevel that planners, health professionals, and members of the publicneed to decide which of the ultimate targets are most relevant to thehealth of the most important target groups, which areas of concernare most relevant, which are the most suitable partners in the ven-ture, how to use information, how to allocate resources, and, finally,how to proceed. KROMBERG,M. Target setting and development of information sys-tems in districts (paper presented at an international meeting onStrengthening District Health Systems Based on Primary Health Care.Harare, Zimbabwe, August 1987). Services required to achieve targetsData from the analysis of the present situation in the district, for example,birth rates, death rates, and the incidence and prevalence of acute and chronicdiseases, are necessary for a realistic estimate of the services required to meetsuch targets as the provision of antenatal care, maternity care, and immu-nizations. If the required information is not available, \"guesstimates\", based 28 Setting objectives end targets on a typical situation in a developing country, may have to be used. Forexample, using the figures below, the annual service workload in a districtwith i00000 inhabitants, can be roughly estimated in terms of numbers ofcases to be treated (Table 6):birth rate: 35 per 1000 population; pregnancies: of3 antenatal visits);proportion of under-fives: 16\" of total population (2 clinic visits peryear);- incidence of tuberculosis: iper moo population (I clinic visit permonth);annual incidence of episodes of diarrhoea: 2.2 per child under five(1 clinic visit per episode);annual incidence of acute respiratory infections (ARV: 2.0 per childunder five (i clinic visit per episode);normal deliveries: 80\"1, of all births.The content of servi:es should be decided.

Photo WHO (20016) BEST COPY AVAILABLE CHAPTER 5The district actionprogramme:improving health services In a district action programme, clear instructions should be given regardingactivities, targets, and resources for each category of work. The specificmeasures taken in a district will depend on the health objectives and servicetargets to be achieved. However, as services in districts are often organizedinto three broad categories(a) curative, (b) maternal and child health, and(c) health promotion and the prevention and control of diseaseit is worthconsidering what sort of measures might be employed in each of these areas.Limited resources will often dictate the implementation of just a few initiat-ives within each category of service, rather than complete coverage of allcategories. Curative servicesFor curative services to be adequate, appropriate facilities, trained personnel,equipment, and drugs must be provided for the key activities of diagnosis,treatment, follow-up, and referral. The ability to provide relief from pain andtreatment for injuries is often the criterion by which people judge the healthsystem. In addition, clean and tidy grounds, buildings, and staff create in thepublic a sense of confidence.All population groups should have reasonable access, on a 24-hour basis,to medical services for acute and emergency cases.The district health officer should ensure that relevant and simple bookson the medicaliand surgical management of common conditions are availableto health workers. He or she should also, particularly where such books arenot easily available, issue documents and circulars giving treatment schedulesfor important or difficult conditions such as burns, acute diarrhoea, acuterespiratory infections, malaria, tuberculosis, and leprosy. These will lead toa better use of drugs and improvements in the quality of care. An outline ofthe possible content of such schedules is given below, for diarrhoea and forburns.Diarrhoea. Mild cases: home treatment consisting of (a) giving plentyof locally available fluids to drink, such as rice water, fruit juice, or3;) 31 Towards * healthy district special home-made sugar and salt solutions; (b) increasing breast-feeding, where applicable; (c) continuing feeding, and watching forsigns of dehydration. If dehydration occurs, the patient is treated withoral rehydration salts (ORS).Burns. Make a rough estimate of percentage of body burnt and depthof burns. If mild, treatment consisting of (a) administering analgesics,(5) protecting the site of the burn, and (c) reassuring the patient. Ifmoderate or severe, treatment in health centre or hospital: (a) treat-ment for shock, may require intravenous fluids; (5) treatment of burnsite; (c) penicillin injection; (d) referral for specific treatment. Severecases may require specialized surgery.Laboratory and radiological services can be of crucial importance in thediagnosis and treatment of patients. It is, therefore, important to ensure thatadequate equipment and supplies as well as appropriately trained staff areavailable,Much can be done to improve the rehabilitation of the disabled. WHOhas developed a community-based approach designed to involve disabledpeople and their families in rehabilitation programmes through which theycan he integrated into school, home, and working environments (5). Strengthening the role of hospitalsThe roles and functions of the district hospital can be summarized under thefollowing five headings:Treatment of referred patients and emergencies.Coordination of health programmes. As well as treating individualpatients, hospitals should be involved in the plznning, coordination,implementation, supervision, and monitoring of primary health care intheir respective catchment areas.Managerial and administrative support. Hospitals may be responsiblefor resource allocation and control throughout the district, dependingon the way health services are organized in the country, for example,whether or not there is a separate health office to deal with administra-tion. 32Education and training (see Chapter 7).Health systems research (see Chapter 9). , Inv.rwIng NM% services A WHO Expert Committee in 1985 drew up a list of 14 questions.reproduced below, to help hospitals re-examine their role in districthealth systems.1. Does the hospital serve a specific population defined in terms ofnumbers, geographical boundaries or other characteristics?2. Does the hospital view its responsibilities as extending to thepopulation outside its walls?3. Does the hospital consider its role in primary health care toinclude participating in the characterization of the problems,resources and needs of the population it serves?4. Does the hospital consider it important to develop relationswith all health agencies in the district, health practitioners ofvarious types, community representatives, and authoritiesfrom other sectors in order to plan how the problems andneeds of the population are to be dealt with?5. Does the hospital participate in defining the prevalence anddistribution of specific health problems (such as malnutrition,diarrhoeal diseases, complications of pregnancy, etc.), andhelp to plan who should be cared for outside the hospital andwho should be hospitalized?6. Does the hospital see its role as participating in the develop-ment and maintenance of an information system that wouldallow a continuous assessment of the status of major prob-lems affecting the population, monitoring of programmes dir-ected at those problems. and evaluation of their effectiveness?7 Does the hospital see its role as participating in health man-power development throughout the area it serves, includinghelping in recruitment, training, supervision, and evaluation ofhealth workers?8 Does the hocpital consider itself to be responsible for provid-ing logistic support (such as bulk purchasing and storage ofsupplies, maintenance of equipment, etc.) to local health ser-vices in the surrounding district?9. With respect to referral of patients, does the hospital considerits role to include developing the criteria for the referral ofpatients from peripheral health workers, specifying the in-formation that should accompany patients to and from thehospital, and training the various personnel to ensure theeggctiveness oi such referral arrangements?10. In viewing the overall costs of primary health care for thedistrict, does the hospital consider it reasonable that re-sources should be allocated across institutional boundaries?(Confmuerl overleaf) 33 Towardsheatthy dadrIct 11. Does the hospital consider the assessment of the quality ofcare to be an important approach to evaluating hospital func-tions, and would the hospital consider it appropriate to extendthis approach to primary health care services in the surround-ing district?12. Does the hospital consider it necessary to make specificfunctional and organizational changes within the hospital inorder to accommodate or facilitate its role in support ofdistrict-wide primary health care activities?13. In evaluating its own performance, does the hospital considerits contributions to surrounding primary health care activitiesas important components of its programmes? How would thehospital assess its contributions? For example, would it useperinatal and infant mortality rates for the whole district or theextent of coverage of the population as indicators of its per-formance?14. Does the hospital consider it to be part of its role to join withcommunity representatives and other interested parties ingenerating social and political support for the overall primaryhealth care effort?WHO Technical Report Series, No. 744, 1987 (Hospitals and health foralt report of a WHO Expert Committee on the Role of Hospitals at theFirst Referral Level). Strengthening health centresBesides a hospital or hospitals, a district may have smaller health facilitiesknown by different names, including health centres, subeentres, clinics,polyclinics, group practices and dispensaries. They are distinguished fromhospitals by the size of the population served, the types of service provided,and the categories of health problems dealt with. The term \"health centre\" isused here to include all facilities other than hospitals.Nowadays health centres are operating increasingly on the principle ofteamwork, whereby a patient may be seen by different health workers atdifferent times. If this very efficient new approach is not to spell the end ofpersonalized care, family cards and outreach programmes should be intro-duced by all health centres.Important factors to be considered in strengthening health centresinclude: 34The siting of health centres, with accessibility asthe key criterion. 42 Improving !math wvicis The organization of services at the health centre. Instead of arrangingservice days and opening hours to suit the staff of the centre, as is oftenthe case, a health centre's opening days and hours should be deter-mined in accordance with the needs, patterns of life, or life-styles of thecommunity. For example, antenatal clinics could coincide with localmarket-days so that women can combine their antenatal care or familyplanning needs with their visit to the market. Also, health facilitiesshould adopt the \"supermarket\" approach, i.e., provide the wholerange of services, at all times, so that users do not have to make separatetrips to the facility for each intervention.The range of services, which should include:curative care: examination and diagnosis, including simple labora-tory investigations and treatment of common diseases, initial treat-ment of complex diseases pending referral to hospital. A few holdingbeds would be useful.follow-up treatment of cases referred back from hospitals.maternal and child health care.prevention and control of common diseases.The interrelationships between health care personnel and the community.The current training of health care personnel in many countries doesnot include teaching staff how to establish good public relations withthe members of the community they serve. Yet everyone knows fullwell that the success or failure of a health centre mostly depends on thisvery ability.Pkysical design of the facility. The structure of a health centre shouldfollow national guidelines, taking into account services to be provided,staffing, and availability of resources. Like the attitude of the staff, thedesign of the facility can improve or impair the acceptability of thecentre. Both the outer appearance of the building and, to a greaterextent, the internal lay-out should be related to, and in conformitywith, the cultural environment of the community to be served. Thesame holds good for the waiting space and the treatment rooms. Whenorganizing space, it is useful to start by asking two simple questions:What work is to be done here? Could this place be arranged in anotherway that would help the work and suit the patient better?Availability of essential drugs and other supplies. This must correspondto the prevailing patterns of health problems in the area.43 35 Towards a healthy district Adequate response to community needs. The activities carried out by thecentre should be relevant to the priority health problems found in theparticular community. This means that the health workers must befully aware of the general health situation of the community they serve.They should learn to appreciate the type and extent of the community'shealth needs and know how to deal with them effectively, not only byusing simple epidemiological methods, but also by ascertaining theopinions of the community.Provision (If- affordable services. In every country, the cost of health careis very much related to the health system as a whole and, in particular,to its planning and financing mechanisms. Hence, the overall financingmechanism of the country plays a determining role. Prohibitive costs tothe patients will lead to the underutilization of available services, withinevitable repercussions on health.Outreach services. Provision of services outside the health centre pre-mises is without doubt one of the key functions of a health centre. Thedevelopment of such services is based on the realization that those whoare able and willing to get to a health centre for care may represent onlya small proportion of those who could benefit from the services itprovides.Adequate staff. The services planned for the provision of care ata health centre will determine the categories of health worker includedin the health centre team. To be able to provide basic services, thefollowing workers (or their equivalents) should constitute the core ofthe team:medical assistant (a few countries have physicians at health centres)nurse/midwifeenvironmental health technicianlaboratory aide or technicianhealth education/extension workerstatistical clerk.Relationship with the hospital. To ensure a viable referral system andgood communication between the health centre and the hospital, theteams of both facilities should hold regular joint consultative meetings. Improving haslet sarvices Training. For health teams to be properly oriented to primary healthcare, it is important that student physicians, nurses, etc. who areundergoing training should have some contact with health centre acti-vities during th :ir basic, postbasic, and continuing education pro-grammes. Also, community-based health workers should be trainedboth in the community and at the health centre, thus strengthening thelinks between the different types of worker.Planning for health and evaluation of health care programmes. The healthcentre is important in the context of intersectoral planning for health.The establishment of a management information system at the healthcentre level would supply the planning process for health with valuableinputs and also furnish indicators or tools for evaluating the variousprogrammes of action at the health centre and community levels.Learning by doing. There is a need for studies on such important aspectsof the health centre as coverage and quality of care. These should becarried out by all health centres, with certain centres selected to carryout more detailed studies, as necessary. The findings would then beused to improve the performance of health centres.

Disease prevention and education are the main areas tobe stressed. The identification of risk factors, such as poor weight gain,oedema, and hypertension, should be carried out on the basis of thehistory and of physical and laboratory examinations. A minimumnumber of visits should be prescribed for women with normal preg-nancies. \"At-risk\" cases should be followed closely. Education shouldbe provided at each visit, using presenters as well as posters and otherprinted material. Topics covered should include nutrition in preg-nancy, breast-feeding, ^4444. sene In India, a health visitor brings advice on family planning to the home rather than waiting foroverburdened mothers to visit the clinic.

Family planuing counselling is an important compon-ent of a maternal and child health service. Counselling should helpwomen to choose contraceptive methods that are appropriate for theirparticular needs. Special attention should be paid to those at high risksuch as adolescents and women who have had five or more pregnancies.Health education. Take the opportunity of every contact with patientsto impart advice. Consider using demonstrations and discussiongroups.Maternal and child health clinics should aim at providing all five servicesat the same time so as to spare paritnts the hardship of repeated journeys.Rendering services more \"humane\" helps to make them more acceptable. Maternal mortalit yEvery maternal death should be investigated and the findings used forimproving maternal and child health services. The major causes of maternalmortality are haemorrhage, obstructed labour, abortion, eclampsia, and sep-sis. Most of these deaths are preventable.In deaths from haemorrhage, predisposing factors such as anaemia shouldbe assessed. Was blood given in time? What was the blood loss at delivery?Were placenta and membrane complete?Obstructed labour is a leading cause of maternal death and morbidity inthe rural areas of many developing countries. Who attended the delivery?What was the duration of each of the stages of labour? It is often necessary totrain traditional birth attendants so as to ensure that deliveries are attendedby qualified workers. Besides improving their skills for safe delivery, trainingshould enable traditional birth attendants to provide:antenatal care, including identification of high-risk women who shouldbe referred to the health centre or hospital;education of mothers on better nutrition, the importance of breast-feeding, family planning, and management of diarrhoea, including theuse of oral rehydration saks.47 39 Toward,healthy dtstsld SO.

Abcede(17745) One problem that often arises is the difficulty in reaching referral hos-pitals in obstetric emergencies, because of long distances and lack of means oftransport. Local solutions to this problem must be sought, such as theestablishment of waiting-houses near hospitals for expectant mothers at risk.Other solutions may be appropriate, depending on the main causes of mor-bidity and death from obstructed labour. Morbidity from obstructed labour,which includes fistulae and urinary incontinence, is in most cases a lifelongcomplaint.In the case of death from abortion, the investigation should establishwhether it was spontaneous or induced ard, if induced, legal or illegal. In thecase of toxaemia, it is particularly important to assess previous obstetrichistory and antenatal care. In the case of leath from sepsis, details of theprobable cause of infection should be established. 40p. BEST COPY AVAILABLE Improving hos Ith services Perinatal and postneonatal mortalityThe causes of deaths occurring between the twenty-eighth week of gestationand the first week of life (perinatal deaths) and those occurring between i and12months of age (postneonatal deaths) are similar. They include low birthweight (often due to maternal malnutrition), birth injury and asphyxia, andintrauterine or neonatal infections such as tetanus. However, there is animportant difference: perinatal deaths are usually due to birth injuries andlow birth weight. The perinatal mortality rate is therefore a good indicator ofthe quality of obstetric care. Infectious diseases are primarily responsible forpostneonatal deaths. Improved maternal and child health servicesin par-ticular, better obstetric care and increased prevention of neonatal tetanus andother infectionscan prevent many of these deaths. School healthA school health programme should have four components:Instruction in health. As far as possible, health topics should be in-cluded in the teaching of other subjects. Teaching aids and materialsadapted to the level of the pupils should be developed. Emphasisshould be on primary schools, as there one is able to reach mostchildren, including those from poor sectors, particularly girls, who arelikely to drop out of further education.Ensuring a healthy school environment. This includes identifying defi-ciencies in the school environment and maintaining hygienic condi-tions, notably as regards cleanliness, housekeeping, and the disposal ofliquid and solid wastes.School health services. These include the prompt diagnosis and treat-ment of disease. School health services should part of the generalhealth services.Involvement of pupils in community health activities. Such involvementcould take different forms, including identification of major healthproblems, health education, sanitation campaigns, latrine-building,and other health-promoting activities.The existence of a district school health committee, consisting of thedistrict education officer and representatives of relevant sectors and agencies,will enhance the organization and management of school health programmes.4 41 Towards a Maltby district 1%7:10\"Children's health, tomorrow's wealth\"happy schoolchildren in Mexico. Photo WHO/P. Almasy (8515) Health promotion, prevention and control of diseaseThe aim here is to encourage good health for individuals and populationgroups through health education and preventive activities. The preventiveapproach should permeate all aspects of district health work.Health promotionFurther to the health education of individuals, which forms part of healthcare, health promotion can be carried out through folk media such as music,song, drama, dance, story-telling, and proverbs, as well as through radio,television, books, films, and games.The most successful way of conveying health messages to the public is byinvolving the community itself. Thus, local composers, musicians, dancers,and comedians should be involved in developing appropriate health mes-sages. Also, health workers can have discussions with local committees in 425..)BEST COPY AVAILABLE Improving health services order to gain an understanding of customs and traditions which will equipthem to formulate appropriate messages in short stories or songs. Communicable diseasesActions for the prevention and control of communicable diseases can bedivided into well-defined sets of activities which will vary in relevancedepending on the specific disease:Disease-spec:fie activities include the immunization of children andexpectant mothers in maternal and child health clinics.Case-finding and treatment demand appropriate diagnosis and patientcompliance. Mass treatment may be required in highly endemic arease.g., where schistosomiasis is rife.Veaor control. Several methods of vector control are possible, includ-ing the use of chemical insecticides and environmental measures suchas swamp drainage. The development of vector resistance to variouschemicals could be a big problem; expert guidance on the substance tobe used should be obtained. A complementary approach to the controlof vectors consists of direct community involvement in the eliminationof domestic and peridomestic mosquito-breeding sites. In addition,personal protective measures to reduce contact between mosquitos andhumans should be promoted.Control of zoonoses, such as rabies and brucellosis, by slaughter ofinfected animals, vaccination of animals, and control of milk and milkproducts.Control of the environment through safe water supplies, sanitary dis-posal of refuse, wastewater, and excreta, and adequate housing.Promoting change in social and behavioural patterns, e.g., identifyingattitudes to disease prevention and immunization and behaviouralpatterns that increase the risk of falling ill.Immunization is the most cost-effective tool available for the control ofcertain major communicable diseases. Its value is enhanced if it isprovided along with other preventive services that increase the chancesof a healthy childhood and adulthood. Measures to achieve satisfactorycoverage include ensuring community participation, outreach pro-grammes, integration with other health service programmes, and con-tinuous monitoring and evaluation, including the follow-up of those r,r 43 Towards a hostel distrld who drop out. To achieve high coverage it is important to use theeducation of mothers at antenatal clinics and of the public in general topromote enrolment of infants in child welfare clinics as soon as possibleafter birth. Secondly, it is necessary to set up an outreach programmeto extend coverage to isolated families and to track down children whohave missed appointments. The need for special efforts or campaigns toincrease coverage should be carefully assessed. Such efforts may beuseful if organized by the district as an extension of ongoing plans,rather than being a parallel one-off activity organized and managedcentrally.EpidemicsAn epidemic is the occurrence of a number of cases of a disease, known orsuspected to be of infectious or parasitic origin, that is unusually large orunexpected for the given place and time (6). To establish the existence ofsuch an outbreak, an increase in the occurrence of cases compared withprevious periods should be verified, using the data avalable. A graph show-ing numbers of cases over a period of time may be of use. It should be bornein mind, however, that a disease may sometimes be found in an area simplybecause of better diagnosis, and that, once a case is identified, others may bepicked up as a result of greater awareness.A disease is endemic when it, or its agent, is usually present in an area. Anendemic disease may become epidemic when a non-immune population, suchas newborn infants or migrants from non-affected areas, is exposed to thedisease agent, or when climatic changes favour its proliferation.Common sources of epidemics include foodborne diseases and infec-tious diseases such as A, encephalitis, meningococcal meningitis, malaria, and Africantrypanosomiasis.The investigation of an epidemic should establish the diagnosis of thedisease, the source of the outbreak, and the mode of spread. The diagnosiscan be established through a detailed clinical and epidemiological historysupplemented by laboratory investigations. The history should establishwho is affected (age, sex, occupation), with what symptoms (pain, fever,diarrhoea, etc.), and when and where the illness began. It is essential to tryto establish the common characteristics of the group affected. A detailedhistory will lead to a provisional diagnosis, which will indicate what speci-mens should be taken for laboratory analysis.Case-finding should focus on careful interviews and contacts. Once thesymptoms and signs of the disease are known by the community, suspected 44 Improving Itooilh services cases may come forward. Knowledge of the incubation period r)f. the diseasemay be helpful in tracing the source of infection. In a point-source epidemic,susceptible individuals are exposed to the diseasc agent at the same time.Most cases will, therefore, occur within a period of time reflecting thevariation in the incubation period for the disease. The increase in cases israpid, as indicated in Fig. 5. This type of outbreak is typical of water- andfoodborne diseases, such as acute gastroenteritis. A vector-borne disease,such as yellow fever, may produce a point-source outbreak when a case entersan area harbouring the Aedes mosquito. Where a point source remainsharardousfor example, when contaminated food is eaten by different sus-ceptible individuals over several dayscases will be spread over a longperiod.In an epidemic of a contagious disease, in which the disease organismpasses from one person to another, the increase in cases is gradual (see Fig. 6)by comparison with a point-source epidemic.

Every effort should be made to identify lapses in environmentalhygiene, such as poor sanitation, insanitary disposal of human excreta,inadequate food hygiene, or polluted water, that may be responsible for anoutbreak. This information should then form the basis of measures designedto prevent the recurrence of the constant danger. Photo WHO/P.

A dis-trict health or development committee can facilitate planning andcoordinate action as necessary. Neighbouring districts should be in-formed of the outbreak. Meetings of staff dealing with different aspectsof the epidemic should be organized regularlyif necessary, dailytoreview the changing situation.Treat cases. Emergency accommodation in schools or elsewhere mayhave to be procured. Staff should be rapidly briefed on the treatment ofcases and on personal safety measures.Isolate cases, if this ;s necessary to limit spread.Prevent spread by means of chemoprophylaxis (e.g., in the case ofplague and malaria) or immunization (e.g., in the case of poliomyelitisand measles). Bear in mind that immunity takes about two weeks todevelop following primary vaccination, but a shorter period followingbooster doses.Institute permanent preventive measures. These may include controlof vector breeding, food hygiene (education and legislation), provisionof safe water, and improvements in personal hygiene.Continue surveillance of the population to identify further outbreaks atan early stage, using such means as the notification of cases by localleaders, teachers, and laboratory staff.Prepare two reports on the epidemic: a simple shortened version for thepublic, and a more detailed account for the ministry of health andpossible publicuion in a scientific journal. PreparednessEpidemics and natural disasters sometimes recur in defined areas and atpartici.lar times; some degree of preparedness is therefore possible. Forexample, areas that are susceptible to plague epidemics should have an activesurveillance system to look out for danger signs.A plan for dealing with outbreaks should be developed and should beknown to health workers. A system of multisectoral coordination is indicated, 47 Towardsitssithy district as well as the training of staff for their role in the investigation and control ofoutbreaks. Noncommunicable diseasesChronic, noncommunicable diseases, such as cancer and cardiovascular dis-eases, are important causes of mortality and morbidity in the d lopedworld. They are also becoming relatively more frequent in the developingcountries with the adoption of Western life-styles and diet. The prevention ofthese diseases can no longer be neglected, particularly as the appropriatemeasures employ relatively simple technology and can be incorporated intoschemes to prevent other diseases in the district.The following approaches to the prevention of noncommunicable diseasemight be considered:Clinical care, e.g., taking blood pressure, diagnosing and treating dia-betes, and counselling on smoking, diet, and alcohol abuse.Health education by means of printed materials, meetings, and the Community organization. This requires an assessment of the existingcommunity organizations and their needs and aims. The cooperation ofschools, women's organizations, the army, social welfare agencies, localnewspapers, priests, and traders should be sought.Environmental and structural improvements. Smoke-free areas, tom -fatfood products, and salt substitutes should be promoted.Other activities. Measures could be undertaken for the control ofcancer, cardiovascular diseases, accidents, and dental caries, accordingto their incidence and importance in the district. Occupational healthThe physical and social environment at the place of work can cause disease.Common hazards include dangerous buildings, machinery, dust, poisons,noise, heat, infections, radiation, and work stress. Accidental injuries to thehead from falling objects and to the eyes, hands, and back (from incorreci6lifting of heavy objects, for example) are fairly common. Other examples orpreventable accidents are explosions, burns, and electric shock. Inhalation ofsmall dust particles can lead to diseases such as silicosis, while cotton and 48 r-, Improving health servIces asbestos fibres may cause respiratory ailments. Exposure to certain chemicalsand allergenic substances can give rise to occupational dermatoses.Exposure to repeated loud noise over a period of time damages the ear andcan lead to deafness. Excessive noise also affects communication and effi-ciency at work.The need to reduce costs with a view to greater competitiveness has ledindustries in some developing countries to apply lower standards of safetythan those prevailing in developed countries, leading to relatively highaccident rates. The number of road deaths is also much higher in developingthan in industrialized countries.In the course of their work, agricultural workers are particularly prone tocertain infectious diseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis,hookworm, and schistosomiasis.The question \"What is your occupa:ion?\" should feature prominently indiscussions with patients and communities. The district health team shouldbe familiar with the various occupation:3 in the district, the diseases associatedwith them, and ways of preventing these diseases. A member of the districthealth team, possibly the person resp-msible for environmental health, couldserve as a focal point for activities in this area. Working environments shouldbe inspected regularly for risk factors, and discussions held with managementand workers on measures to deal with any adverse finding. In large places ofwork, health and safety committees should be established.A district occupational programme which would, among other things,ensure the availability of adequate skills to carry out the above activitiesought to be developed. Environmental healthIn developing countries, environmental health should be considered togetherwith occupational health, as the dividing line is rather thin: more often thannot, industries are located in residential areas.Important elements of environmental sanitation are: safe water supply,sanitary excreta disposal, disposal of solid wastes, drainage of surface water,safe food preparation, and shelter that is adequate from the standpoints ofsize and structural stability.A protected water supply piped into individual dwellings or groups ofhouses may not be possible in the case of a large population, particularly inrural areas where households are widely dispersed. Alternative sources aresprings, streams, ponds, lakes, surface wells, and deep boreholes. Actionmust be taken to find new sources and to ensure that these and others already 5 7 49 Towards a hatithy district ^r,41P.\" .1k1\"01610: 440.z-Hardly the most suitable place to do the weekly laundry: this sluggish stream Is actually anopen sewer.

Water may carry harmful bacteria and various protozoal and helmin-thic parasites. Periodic examination of water samples should be carried out todetect bacteria (the Escherichia coli count is commonly used in this connec-tion). Involvement of the community, particularly the women, is essential inthe planning and management of water programmes so as to ensure thecontinued maintenance of supplies and their correct use by the public.Facilities for the sanitary disposal of human excreta are inadequate inmany developing countries. Several types of latrine, at various levels ofsophistication and adaptable to different environments, are available. TheBlair latrine or ventilated pit latrine is so constructed that it is free from theflies and smell associated with ordinary pit latrines. Plans and targets fordistrict action must be set up with the communities concerned (7). Thesupport provided, e.g., subsidies for toilet slabs, will vary according to needsand resources.The disposal of solid wastes is an increasing problem in the urban areasa developing countries because of organizational and financial short- 50BEST COPY AVAILABLE Improving hoolth servIess comings. Well-known technologies for the management of solid wastes areavailable (8).Concerted action is needed to encourage and support communities inbuilding houses that are structurally sound. The designs and materials usedwill depend on local conditions, particularly the climate and the level ofdevelopment. Sensible siting can minimize the risks of flooding, landslides,road accidents, and exposure to noise and industrial emissions. Housing,village, and township planning committees should include competent healthworkers. Awareness of the importance of good, well-appointed houses, and ofcleanliness in and outside the house, should be promoted through healtheducation (9).A suitably trained health worker should coordinate district activities inrespect of food safety. Mental healthDespite greatly expanded health facilities and personnel, mental health pro-grammes remain rudimentary in many districts. Yet much can be done toprevent and treat the major problems encountered in this area, i.e., depres-sion, suicide, epilepsy, schizophrenia, mental retardation, and behaviouralproblems arising from drug and alcohol abuse (zo, 1).The aim should be to raise the community's awareness of mental healthissues and ensure that health workers and other leaders at all levels in thedistrict have the basic skills and the commitment needed to support theprogramme. Guidelines based on national policies for the prevention andtreatment of each of the more common conditions should be provided by thedistrict health officer. These should cover diagnostic assessment, drug treat-ment, social management, and prevention of relapse.The community health worker should be skilled in (a) the promotion Jimental health, (b) the prevention of suicide, (c) the identification of majormental disorders, epilepsy, and alcohol and drug abuse, and (d) the manage-ment of psychiatric emergencies. He or she should also be able to advise andrefer patients as necessary and to follow them up. The extended familyprovides care for chronically ill patients in many developing countries. Thecommunity health worker should accordingly work closely with communityleaders and families.Health centres should he able to provide simple treatment and/or sedationwhere immediate referral is not possible, and to continue treatment begun atthe district hospital. 51 Towards a Maltby district At district level, provision should be made for therapeutic care andmental health education. One of the physicians involved should have someskill in psychiatry. One health workera psychiatric nurse, if one is avail-ableshould be responsible for coordinating mental health work in thedistrict. He or she should see that a sufficient stock of medicines is available,cooperate with workers in other disciplines and sectors, organize orientationcourses for community health workers and community leaders, and supportthe health centre and the community health workers.Outreach programmesIn districts in which the focus of health care is the local hospital or healthcentre, a major reorganization may be required in order to develop outreachprogrammes aimed at maintaining optimal health in the catchment a:ea of thehealth facility concerned. Unfortunately, such programmes are often seen asZ:eing outside the work of the facility, or even as being in conflict with itsinterests.

Littlewood (17896) 52 6 9BEST COPY AVAILABLE Improving hmolth sorvkfts This was probably justified in the past whenmany major rural health facilities in developing countries were manned by one person. It would have been unacceptable for the health worker to leave hisor her patients, some of whom might requireconstant attention. The situation has improved drhrnati- cally in recentyears with a considerable increase in the number of health workers and greater accessibility to curative services, so that responsibility can be accepted, not only for the sick, but also for maintaining health in a given geographical area. This approach has yet to be implemented on a national scale in many countries. Many problems have still to beovercome, but perhaps the most difficult is the inbuilt bias of health workers in favour of institution-based services.The outreach programme's unit of care is the family and the locality (or localities) rather than theindividual. Outreachprogrammes need to be planned by the district health team and may take different forms. They may be carried out by mobile clinics, either in public placesor at health posts. The services providedare usually centred around maternal and child care. Here the activities include healtheducation, antenatalcare and care of children tt'At, AMA- ck ormo In the Philippines,nursing education is being reoriented to bring nurses closer to the real needs and problems of communities.

This is followed by a seminar ineach district supported by the newly trained regional staff. At the endof the seminar, participantsdraw maps of the catchment area of eachhealth unit, indicating houses, schools, paths, and water sources.This is divided into \"sectors\" consisting of the number of houses thatcan reasonably bevisited by one member of staffa nurse, midwife,or healthinspectorwithin a 12-week period by devotingdaysper week to thisfield work. Each sector is then divided into 12 zones.At the beginning, each staffmember does two things: he or shecompletes a simple census, and persuades one resident in each zoneto be a \"healthcollaborator\". Priority is given to previously trainedhealth promoters or traditional birth attendants. The healthcollabor-ators are trained before thefirst round of visits.hi each home, the staffmember, appropriately kitted out andaccompanied by the collaborator, performs the following tasks:raises awareness of health needs- registerschildren 5 updatesthe census form.As the gainsmomentum in a given district, otheractivities are gradually added: for example, dealing with acute re-spiratory infections, improving sanitation, growth monitoring, car-rying out the first antenatalcheck, and advising onchild-spacing.On the day after the homevisits, the staff member returns to thezone to perform thevaccinations planned on the first day. These are improving health services usually performed in the house of the collaborator who also goes tofetch any missing children. Those still absent at the end of the sessionare given an appointment for the following week in the next zone. Onthe afternoon after the vaccination session, the staff member visits thecollaborator to review the activities and discuss any problems.Results from this approach are encouraging: hospital mortalityand the rate of hospitalization of children have fallen markedly, whilecoverage by immunization has risen dramatically. The utilization offixed health services has also increased.A gradual upgrading of the education of the health volunteers iscontemplated. Canalizaci6n makes it possible to slant this upgradingtowards the strengthening of overall community organization anddevelopment.MONTOYA, C.

Allhospitals, healtl. centres, and other health units should audit the quality ofthe services provided at least once every three months. The audit should becarried out by a committee chaired by the officer in charge at a session thatmay be attended by all staff. A record of the findings should be made for theinformation of staff who have attended the session and for future reference.Quality is assessed on the basis of a review of charts and case-notesrelating to various services (antenatal, child welfare, family planning and in-patient, for example). It is best to review the charts of one kind of service ata time. The charts to be reviewed are selected by some quasi-randommethod, e.g., every fifth chart, decided on the spot, taking into considerationthe total number of charts. Where charts are few, it may be feasible to reviewall of them. It may also be decided to review all charts with particularfeatures, e.g., all those relating to cases of maternal death.The review will cover the adequacy of the clinical history, the examina-tion, the investigations carried out, the management plan, and the instruc-tions given. Below are some examples of areas to which attention should bepaid. Maternal and child health programmeAre the scheduled activities of the maternal and child health clinicfollowedfor example, the provision of health education?Were the minimum prescribed procedures for pregnant women, e.g.,blood pressure, urine, and haemoglobin checks, followed?Have abnormal findings, such as low haemoglobin or high bloodpressure, been adequately followed up?Any irregularities in individual rec.,)rds that may require further actionshould be noted.The review will indicate the level of staff members' skills and knowledge,as well as gaps and lapses in the delivery of services. Such information isinvaluable for assessing what further improvements are needed.For quality assessment to be meaningful, there should be prior agreementon major issues relating to the way care is provided, e.g., criteria for admis-sion to hospital, management of major diseases. Criteria for admission to 56 improving hosIth services hospital in pregnancy, for example, might include:severe anaemiapersistent fever of more than 38.3' C (tot\"F) for more than 5 daysabnormal findings in cerebrospinal fluidsystolicbloodpressurereadings of under 80 mm Hg or over200mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure of less than 60 mm Hg orgreater than120mm Hgonset of unconsciousness or disorientationbleedingchest pain and/or signs of acute ischaemiawound or surgical emergencyobstetric problems, including obstructed labour. 57 CHAPTER 6The district actionprogramme:joint actionCommunity participationPrimary health care starts with the individual and the family. Action byindividuals and by the community may bring about marked improvements inhealth and in progress towards the achievement of the district's healthobjectives and targets. In addition, the active involvement of communities inthe planning and management of health programmes is essential to theirsuccess.Individual and family actionAction for health by individuals and families may take the following forms:adoption of a healthy way of lifeprevention of specific diseasesdiagnosis and treatment of illness when it occursappropriate use of available health services.Of these, adoption of a healthy way of life and the prevention of specificdiseases are the most likely to lead to a significant and sustained improvementin health.Healthy way of life. Individuals can limit or avoid certain risks to theirhealth by adopting a healthy life-style based on such things as cleanli-ness and abstinence from smoking. It is better to start early so thathabits adopted in childhood are carried through into adult life.Family planning is another healthy practice that can be adopted byindividuals and families. Spacing births at least two years apart leads tobetter health for both children and parents.Healthy living not only entails behaviour that promotes the healthof the body, such as eating sensibly, hut is also concerned withbehaviour that bypasses or limits the effects of health hazards in thecommunity. A balanced diet is healthy, hut its benefit may he limited iffood and drinking-water are not protected against contamination.I lygiene and sanitation go hand-in-hand with proper nutrition. 58 Joint action Prevention of specific diseases. Certain diseases may present sucha threat to the health of a community as to demand a special effort byindividuals and families to prevent them, or at least to reduce theirfrequency. For example, community members can help to controlmalaria by:learning to recognize the symptoms of malaria and treat it withappropriate drugs;- making sure that family members take their prescribed treatments;ensuring that expectant mothers, children under five, and othersat high risk receive chemoprophylaxis;- taking measures to prevent mosquito bites: covering windows anddoors with mosquito-proof materials, and wearing appropriateclothes;taking measures to prevent mosquito-breeding: filling in pools ofstagnant water, cutting long grass, and keeping the environmentclean;- cooperating in national, regional, or local efforts to control malaria,e.g., providing samples for blood slides and cooperating in sprayingdwellings with residual insecticides. Community actionIt is the responsibility of every member of the community to take appropriateaction, not only because it offers an effective means of achieving a high levelof health for all, but also because the failure of some individuals to participatecan jeopardize the action taken by the others. For example, a single house-hold with poor sanitation is a source from which infection can spread.Communities may usefully take additional action as a whole or throughparticular groups such as schools, religious bodies, and voluntary groups.This includes:Clearing land for the construction of a health centre or road; makingbricks and transporting materials to a building site; digging trenchesfor a piped water supply; clearing and tilling land for the production ofnutritious foods. These activities could be carried out on a regular (sayweekly) basis until the particular project is completed. 59 Towards s healthy district -41 i 'i.,.0, ,i,,, \\ I. 4,%\"7^' -t\" IL,1111404.6110111: aA sail, =,74af, 't4.\" %IVa Involving the community is as important as political will for successful developmentmeasures such as improvement of water supply and soil conservation.

An example of this is the school production unitwhere pupils learn the skills needed for cultivating crops and veg-etables, keeping livestock, and making and maintaining tools. Thepupils' produce may be shared out within the community or put tomore restricted use, e.g., to provide nutritious food for school orhospital meals.Collection of health and health-related data. Schoolchildren and com-munity groups can play an extremely important role as collectors ofinformation, preferably on a routine basis, in collaboration with thecommunity health worker and other health staff. The data collected BEST COPY AVAILABLE6' Joint action might include information on births, deaths, cases of sickness, nutri-tional status, levels of community sanitation and water supply, andimmunization coverage.Participation in assessment of needs and in the identification of healthpriorities. Community representatives could be invited to attend meet-ings of the district health management team and thus become involvedin decision-making. Keeping the community informedCommunities need to be informed of how their activities are contributing tothe achievement of district goals and targets, and how they compare withthose of other communities in the district.Possible means of doing this are as follows:Regular reporting of primary health care activities at meetings.Regular reporting of primary health care activities to individual fam-ilies during household visits by the community health worker.Regular publication of a community \"newspaper\", which may consistof a blackboard set up in some public place, handwritten or printedwall-posters, or a printed newsletter distributed to households.Inclusion of news items about primary health care in the mass medianewspapers, the radio, and sometimes television. Community health workers and leadersCommunity health workers and local leaders have an important contributionto make to community involvement in primary health care. They representthe community and are responsible to it in carrying out their duties. They arealso responsible for promoting changes in the community which will result inbetter health. They act as a link between the community and the healthsystem, and are thus influcntia! in helping the community and local healthworkers achieve mutual understanding and respect, thereby enhancing theolfectiveness of primary health care. Community health workers can helpachieve the fundamental goals of primary health care, that is, to makeessential health care accessible to the entire population through a mixture ofpreventive, promotive and curative activities. 61 Towardshealthy district Thailand Two types of viffage health worker are deployed in Thailand: villagehealth communicators and village health volunteers. Village healthcommunicators are trained and given guidelines to enable them toserve as disseminators of health information to groups of 10-15families. For every ten communicators, there is one village healthvolunteer, who is given more training and responsibility in such areasas health promotion, disease prevention, simple medical care, andmanagement. In Thailand today, there are about 42 325 volunteersand 434 803 communicators, effectively covering 90% of Thai villages(53 000 villages out of 57 398). Mobilizing community resourcesThe resources available for health care, particularly in developing countries,are limited. Community involvement in primary health care makes it possibleto mobilize community resources that might otherwise remain unused.Examples of such involvement are given below. 62Action by the people. This could include the provision of physicallabour for building a health centre or constructing a safe well orsanitary latrine; the provision of transport to take a woman in labour ora sick person to hospital; the organization of a special day for immu-nization and for identification of children at special risk.Provision of facilities. A building owned by the community might beallocated to the community health worker for treating patients orstoring medicines and records.Provision of goods and materials. The following could be provided: foodsuch as grain, fruit, and fish for cooking demonstrations or for distribu-tif.n to malnourished children; agricultural implements to boost com-munity food production; or building materials, such as wood andbricks, to be used in self-help construction schemes.Money or contributions. Money donated for primary health care ina community may be used to purchase medicines, to purchase equip-ment such as agricultural implements, or to pay the community healthworker.7 ,) Joint action 4,orw./.1/4;,6,...1/4.4..-.;,*,...........,..,\"--..N.sa t.:j..*/....--8-.4. %,..k aIf11.1....,;\"'Nlifipia110 1 4 .\".:NeW:').7..,,1141.414*:4.'-'61011P11SCiike4%'I.. 4\"Digging for water is a community effort for these Sudanese villagers who are among theworld's most desperately poor people.

People's participation in YugoslaviaIn general, two forms of community participation may be distinguishedOne consists in mobilizing people to participate directly in a community-based programme, by making contributions in cash or in kind or byoffering their own labour; in this case, they are self-providers of ser-vices. The other involves the participation of users in the managerialprocess, so that they become decision-makers; in this way they aredirectly involved in the process of social control.It is this second form of participation that has been developed inYugoslavia in line with a more general strategy of promoting self-managemept in all public services and social activities. So-called \"self-managing communities of interest\" have a constitutional basis. Theirassemblies comprise delegates of the health users (workers and citi-zens) and of the health providers. Within these communities, formed atall levels, health needs are identified, and programmes developud andmanaged, on a basis of solidarity. There is a free exchange of labourbetween the users and the providers of health care. Community self-help schemesIn many countries, work schemes undertaken by communities on a self-helpbasis have made important contributions to development. Apart from theconstruction of health facilities, possibilities include the improvement ofcommunity housing and the construction or maintenance of (a) wells andborehok.s providing safe drinking-water, and (b) facilities for the disposal ofexcreta and wastes.The term \"self-help\" has been taken to mean that a community takescomplete responsibility for a project from planning through to implementa-tion, including the provision of all resources. In practice, resources such asbuilding materials and other equipment are often obtained from outsideauthorities. To ensure effective use of the community's resources, it is 65 Towards a itaalthy district -de4.94.r0.7NIPArt'.:::441e7./,\" '42 ilatAg..::7a141;\":SamIrorsj.10.Jr. Ati+,1 NOt;1*Yek..Twice a month, the villagers of Sarawak spend a morning at the watershed removing sand.gravel, and silt and generally cleaning up the dam.

Alscede (17112) essential that good cooperation should be established between the com-munity and all relevant outside authorities, from the earliest stages of plan-ning to completion of the project. Bottom-up planningEmphasis should be given to the development of programmes throughdialogue with the community, rather than using a top-down approach,whereby communities are expected to implement projects that have beendeveloped at higher levels or even outside the country. Village committees,women's and youth organizations, and similar bodies may need to be set up tofacilitate the necessary participation. Joint work with communities calls forattitudinal changes on both sides and is a slow process. It can be achievedonce communities develop and take their health and their lives into their ownhands to a greater extent.7 ;BEST COPY MAILABLE \"Basic participation in top-down programmes usually consists ofcontributing labour and resources. The community's understanding ofa problem is seldom considered, nor are there mechanisms to commu-nicate such information upwards. To redress this situation, Thailand hasadopted the Basic Minimum Needs strategy, which is essentially a data-collection exercise carried out by village leaders supported by govern-ment officials. There are eight basic minimum needs:1. Family members should consume sufficient nutritious and safefood to meet their physical needs.2. Every family should have appropriate shelter and enjoy appropri-ate environmental conditions.3. People should have ready access to those basic social servicesthat are necessary for maintaining life and activity.4. People should enjoy security as regards their lives and pos-sessions.5.

Zambia: district action committees forprimary health careIn 1985, a national group, with members drawn from the Ministries ofHealth, Agriculture, Labour, an0 Social Services, as well as the NationalFood and Nutrition Commission, the institute of African Studies, and theDepartment of Community Medicine at the University of Zambia, wasformed to provide support for a project to strengthen intersectoral actionin a number of selected areas, starting in Mumbwa District. Apart fromdeveloping and sustaining intersectoral initiatives in the district, theproject was intended to give members of the national primary healthcare committee and the district committee etii opportunity to gain first-hand experience of carrying out community diagnoses and engage ina dialogue with members of the community, and also to bring the 7;)67 Towards a healthy district national group into closer contact with concerns and constraints at thedistrict level.Three days of orientation training were organized for the districtprimary health care committee by the national action group. The sub-jects reviewed included primary health care strategies in the district, therationale and importance of intersectoral action in health development,and the details of the project. The district committee identified threeareas in which the project could be initiated. Local committees wereformed in these areas, and planning for community diagnoses wentahead. The plans included the development of a household question-naire by national, district, and local committee members. In early 1987,household surveys were conducted in the three selected locations.National participation was gradually reduced so that the final survey wasconducted mainly by the district team. The data are now being analysedand will be used by the district committee in discussions and planningsessions with the local committees. Intersectoral actionThe district health system should be concerned with improving the healthand quality of life of the population, and not just with providing services forthe care of the sick. However, the efforts of the health sector alone are notenough to bring about significant improvements in health. Other sectors suchas economic development, agriculture, education, and water supply may, insome situations, have an even greater potential for improving health than thehealth sector itself. In trying to achieve their individual sectoral objectives,they exert a powerful influence on health, both positive and negative.The district is in a better position than the province or the centralauthority to achieve effective coordination with health-related sectors in theplanning and implementation of health development. A key step in strengthen-ing district health systems is to ensure intersectoral action.Approaches for encouraging intersectoral action include the following:When planning new initiatives, greater emphasis should be placed onrisk factors for health rather than on actual health problems. This willnaturally lead to intersectoral action, since the reduction of many riskfactors does not necessarily fall within the sphere of the health sectoritself but may depend on other sectors. For example, achieving cleanerwater supplies is a task for the district council's utilities department,while action to improve knowledge of health issues, such as familyplanning, nutrition, and the dangers of smoking, may quite reasonablybe taken jointly by the education and health sectors. 687 Joint action Initiatives to reduce inequities in the health sector may lead to intersec-toral collaboration. This is because such inequities are closely linked toinequities in other sectors such as income, nutrition, water supply,sanitation, and education.Intersectoral collaboration may be fostered through the administrativestructures at district level. At this level, senior health service staff willbe well known by the local community and should be able to participatein the proceedings of district development committees, municipalcouncils, etc. and influence them. Special intersectoral boards may alsobe formed to promote intersectoral activities. In addition, districthealth staff can approach district committees responsible for othersectors, e.g., the local education committee.It might also be advantageous to select or appoint district health staffwho would have special responsibility for the promotion of inter-sectoral cooperation.Some examples of contributions to health development by specific sectorsare described below. AgricultureWidespread malnutrition is rampant in many districts in developing coun-tries. The adoption by governments of appropriate agricultural policies,relating, for example, to food prices, land ownership, and locally :-...ultivatedcrops, is crucial in ensuring an adequate supply of nourishing food. Targetsshould be agreed upon and set with regard to the supply of good food andnutritional status (for example, weight for ag e. and birth weight). Activitiesthat can help ensure a sufficient supply of nutritious food include: assistingthe community, through modern methods of farming, to increase foodproduction; improving grain storage and preservation to reduce losses; andfinding markets for farmers' products. Rural dswelopmentExperience shows that overall economic development contributes to im-provements in health. Local income-generating projects should be promotedand supported.7 7 69 Towardshealthy district Women's affairsThe role of women, as both providers and receivers of health care, is beingincreasingly recognized. Women's organizations should be involved in plan-ning and managing health programmes. These organizations can encourageworen to practise family planning and breast-feeding, educate mothers toattend maternal and child health clinics, and inspire them to educate theirchildren to observe personal hygiene.Education (formal and informal)The success of health programmes is related to literacy rates, particularlyamong women. For example, infant mortality is lower in countries or districtswhere the literacy rate among women is comparatively high. District pro-grammes should, therefore, encourage widespread improvements in formaland informal education, particularly education of wcmen.Water and sanitationTargets should be set, and programmes developed and implemented, for theprovision of safe, potable water and for the sanitary disposal of excreta. HousingMany people, particularly in urban slums and in rural areas, live in substan-dard dwellings with little space and ventilation. Such conditions are condu-cive to the spread of airborne diseases. District plans for improving dwellingsshould be encouraged. ^The integrated service post in IndonesiaIn Indonesia, community health services are available from integratedservice posts called posyandu. There volunteers from the communityand regular staff from the health centres come together for one day eachmonth to otter integrated family health services.The posyandu, or integrated service post, is a centre for communica-tion and the delivery of health services by and for the community. It aims 707:) Joint action at integrating:intersectoral development programmesintrasectoral health programmesprofessional and traditional services.The health services provided by the posyandu cover maternal andchild health, family planning, immunization, improvement of nutrition,and diarrhoeal disease control.The posyandu is organized and supported by the Women's FamilyWelfare Movement (PKK), a voluntary movement whose goals are thedevelopment of communities, both in rural and urban areas, and thepromotion of better welfare and a decent standard of living. The move-ment's target is the family unit, with the mother as the focal point. ThePKK is part of the programme of the Community Resilience Leaguewhich is concerned with community participation in the execution ofrural development policies and helps plan and implement local develop-ment activities.The PKK and the Community Resilience League have boards at alllevels of local government and at the national level. Throughout thecountry, PKK teams facilitate, motivate, monitor, and supervise themovement's activities at the next lower level. The lowest level is calledthe Group of Ten and consists of ten households served by one PKKmember. The process of community involvement is usually as follows:At a meeting of official and unofficial leaders, held at village level,health centre staff introduce the concept of the integrated servicepost.The community, with support from health centre staff, conductsa community self-survey with the objective of identifying problemsand increasing awareness of health needs.The results of this survey are presented and discussed at a \"com-munity consensus meeting\", in which the whole community par-ticipates. During this meeting priority problems and solutions aredetermined.In areas where the posyandu is well established, community volun-teers (preferably accompanied by the local chief) visit the homes oftarget groups one to two days before the posyandu session. After thesession, a meeting is held to discuss the effectiveness of the prepara-tions, the implementation of the session, and the coverage achieved,and to complete the recording and reporting of the day's activities.The posyandu strategy is still evolving and requires strengthening.A recent development is that of rewarding the posyandu for identifyingilliterate mothers of under-fives. These mothers are then offered literacytraining and informal guidance on home industry. Other health-promotingactivities are being explored. 71 Towards a halthy district Integration of vertical programmes'I'he great technological progress seen in the 19405 and 19505, particularly thedevelopment of vaccines and more effective drugs, led to the initiation ofvarious special programmes aimed at particular health problems. Manycampaigns were organized against communicable diseases such as malaria,smallpox, sexually transmitted diseases, yaws, tuberculosis, and schis-tosomiasis. Through the vertical approach, substantial advances were madein the control of a number of diseases, and it undoubtedly contributed to theconsiderable improvements in health observed over the past 20-30 years.The eradication of smallpox is a noteworthy example. However, not allpositive results are attributable to specific campaigns. If yaws, for instance,was eradicated in a number of countries in the 1950s by special campaigns, it dis-appeared from many other countries around the same time, probably as a res-ult of improved hygiene, housing, clothing, water supplies, and health services.From the perspective of the community, the trouble with vertical pro-grammes is their fragmentary approach to community healtn. The early19705 saw renewed emphasis on integration. In nearly all vertical programmes,experience has shown that the effective coverage of large populations whereservices are limited demands a health infrastructure in continuous contactwith individuals and families. Such an infrastructure requires: a network offacilities, manpower, supplies, and transport; an information system respon-sible for surveillance of diseases and populations and capable of monitoringprogress; manpower development, including training and supervision; andmanagerial capability, notably in planning and evaluation.Priority in the development of primary health care should, therefore, begiven to building the requisite infrastructure alongside associated pro-grammes. The participation of outside agencies, which promote verticalprogrammes simply because they can obtain quick results that will be visibleto their governing bodies, may be counterproductive. It should be possible toarrive at a compromise whereby the agencies would support the overalldevelopment of the infrastructure, as well as individual programmes.Integration faces many problems. Where there has been a history ofstrong vertical programmes using various categories of single-purposeworker, there may be difficulties in adjusting differential salaries, senioritylevels, etc. The attitude of health workers may also be a problem: often staffare not psychologically prepared for change, continue to give preference totheir previous programmes, and fail to create the desired Linkages acrossprimary health care programmes.District health officers should be aware of these difficulties and constantlyreview the organizational structure and managerial procedures in order to 72 Joint faction alleviate the situation. The joint training of staff and regular meetings may beof help.It is inevitable that, in certain circumstances, the generalist will have todepend on the expert for guidance. The presence of specialized units atvarious levels of the ministry of health may be necessary to deal adequatelywith particular situations and to determine and monitor appropriate forms ofhealth action.At district level, the district health officer is solely responsible for theexecution of all programmes within his or her area of jurisdiction. Thedistrict health planning or management team must not be bypassed, and allactivities should be carried out through the member of the team responsiblefor the activities indicated in Fig. 7.The distribution of financial responsibility for the various programmeshas been a bone of contention in a number of countries. While specialized 4.0technical units at the central level certainly may need a clearly defined budgetfor the support they provide, they should not as a rule have financialresponsibility for routine district primary health care activities. The budgetfor operational activities should be the responsibility of the health team atdistrict level.

Nongovernmental organizations and government departments,particularly those responsible for local government, operate extensive healthcare programmes. In addition, it is necessary to consider both private andtraditional practitioners, not to mention self-medication, which may occur ona large scale. Private spending on health in some countries is 4-5 timesgreater than public spending on health. Useful and effective traditionalpractices can be included in, or coordinated with, organized health care. Thework of traditional midwives has been closely linked with maternal and childhealth in many countries, and there is little controversy about their role. Thesituation is different, however, with other traditional practitioners. A numberof countries have introduced elements of traditional medicine into the cur-ricula of health workers and aspects of western practice into traditionalmedicine; traditional practice has thus been incorporated into formal, organ-ized care. But in some countries, there is considerable hostility between thetwo systems. In all communities, traditional practitioners are influentialfigures to whom people turn for advice, openly or in confidence. The type oflinkage or coordination between the two systems will vary according tocircumstances in the district and national policies. The organization oforientation meetings for traditional practitioners (on their own or with otherlocal leaders) will facilitate collaboration. Coordination with relevant agen-cies is crucial for the success of primary health care, and it is useful to havesome kind of mediumfor example, a biennial or annual meeting for theexchange of ideas and the development of joint plans with major healthagencies.Achievements of an integrated programme in SriLanka In an attempt to strengthen the delivery of primary health care, Sri Lankahas improved the organization and management of its district healthsystems and avoided vertical programmes and campaigns. Forexample, Sri Lanka does not have a separate immunization programme;immunization is an integral part of the maternal and child health pro-gramme.This is the context in which the results of the 1986 review of theimmunization programme, carried out by Sri Lanka with the help of WHOand UNICEF, should be seen. Over 90% of the children surveyed werefound to have received BCG and three doses of diphtheria/pertus-sis/tetanus (DPI) and oral poliovirus vaccines. The high levels of cover-age exceed those found in many developed countries. 74 CHAPTER 7Implementation To strengthen district primary health care, it is essential to improve opera-tional management. This chapter presents six key issues pertaining to goodmanagement.Personnel and trainingThe types of personnel required in a district will depend on the localsituation. What is important is that the level of manpower and skills ismatched with the tasks to be carried out, and that the staff are adequatelydistributed throughout the district health system. In many countries, staffinglevels are adequate, but further training may be required in order to reorientthem towards primary health care.Staff are often ill-prepared for the changes tequired by current healthtraining programmes. Moreover, the need for intersectoral planning willdemand readiness on the part of health workers to adopt new ways ofthinking and interact more widely with communities and other developmentsectors. It is therefore crucial to ensurp appropriate orientation of the districthealth team, perhaps by means of annual or biennial one-day seminars withmembers of the district development committee. The support of the regionalor central level in organizing such seminars should be sought.Many health workers, particularly in peripheral units, work in isolation.Some may not have attended refresher courses since aualifying, perhapsmany years earlier. Their skills, which begin to decline after qualification,may sink to a level where they are not only useless but an actual hazard.Sometimes workers are overtrained, with the same people attending coursesthat are usually relatedto cne programme only. A plan of actionfor the reorientation of all health staff within the district may need to bedeveloped, and the potentials of activity-based and distance learningexplored.Activity-based learning combines in-service training seminars or work-shops with regular supportive supervision. An initial workshop introducesnew skills, which are then implemented in practice with supervisory support.The problems encountered may be discussed at a second workshop several 75 Towards a healthy dishict e' 1.4., Medical students in Mexico must undertake work in local communities before they canquality as doctors Here two students visit a patient in a rural Mexican community. PhotoWHO/Mexican Ministry of Health and Welfare (19225) months later. A further period of implementation is followed by an assess-ment workshop.The principles underlying district health systems, as outlined above, haveconsiderable implications for the type of training and orientation that shouldbe provided. Training should impart epidemiological knowledge and skillsthat will enable health workers to work out the rationale behind what they doand plan their work to the best advantage. For example, they will know whento expect malaria or diarrhoea in their area and thus be able to plan appro-priate preventive and curative activities. The often expressed fear thatperipheral workers are being asked to do too much stems from a failure torealize film, if properly oriented, peripheral health workers can be their ownepidemiologists.A problem that many klistrict health officers have to face, therefore, is thatof coordinating individual training courses for programmes such as im-munization, the provision of essential drugs, and the management of diar-rhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, leprosy, etc. The training materials for these 76BEST COPY AVAILABLES ; Implementation 1.111.11CIN A nurse from the Korean National Tuberculosis Association explains to two student nurseshow to interview patients and take case histories. Photo WHO/P. Booms (1.7780)programmes have usually been prepared separately. Various ways of inte-grating the training have been and continue to be explored by individualcountries and by WHO. Important health problems for which no specificmanuals have been proposed may also need to be identified and dealt with intraining courses. Training awraja health managers in EthiopiaThe strengthenng of district :lealth systems requires dynamic leader-ship and continuous attention to management. Strong interlevel links,intersectoral coordination, and community participation in primaryhebith care are all vital to the effective management of a decentralizedinfrastructure. The training and responsibilities of health personnel,however, often limit their ability to attend to these factors. In 1986,Ethiopia accordingly decided to introduce a new type of professionalhealth workerthe awraja (district) health managerto redrAss thesituation. A two-year training programme far graduate physicians was BEST COPY AVAILABLE8577 Towards a healthy district introduced, combining theory, field experience, and in-service super-vision.The training of medical graduates as district health managers inEthiopia is a first attempt to develop leaders and agents of change for thedistrict. The new course has been designed with the aim of traininga new brand of primary health care manager to meet the needs of theawraja health administration. These managers are expected to be muchmore than administrators. They have to be leaders, trainers, anda source of inspiration as regards the development of primary healthcare.In contrast to traditional curricula, the training programme for awrajahealth managers is competency-based, due account being taken of thejob description.Awraja health managers will:- work with mass organizations in the awraja to identify health-related problems and advise on means of overcoming them:- organize, manage, and administer the health services of theawraja so as to ensure maximum coordination of the availableservices and to achieve optimum coverage, efficiency, andeffectiveness;- plan the health services in the awraja;ensure the coordination of intersectoral health-related activities;develop and/or strengthen the system for the collection, analysis,and interpretation of information necessary for health planningand management, including monitoring and evaluation at all levelsin the awraja;participate in the planning and operation of training programmesfor professional and other cadres of health staff in the awraja.Above all, the training stresses the importance of the awraja healthmanager as an agent of change. Through discussion, persuasion, andmobilization, he or she must bring about a commitment to primary healthcare on the part of professional health workers, members of other keysectors, and the mass organizations involved.In order to impart the knowledge and develop the skills needed tocarry out these functions, the course emphasizes the concept of \"learn-ing by doing\". The first part of the course consists of theoretical trainingin planning, epidemiology, management, and communication, inter-spersed with two months of practical field work, with emphasis ondesigning surveys involving the community and on the identification ofpriority problems.During the following year, the students become acting awraja healthmanagers and are expected to put into practice what they have learned.They also undertake a research project which forms the basis of theirdissertation leading to an MSc degree in community health. 78 Implementation ole.464!'AM'at's, ...Imo'Aire./..

PhotoWHOM. da Silva (17213)National and district authorities may also consider starting primaryhealth care newsletters, where these do not already exist. Many countries arefinding such newsletters very useful for the continuing orientation of staffand the exchange of ideas. The installation of district and health centrelibraries is also an important cost-effective way of ensuring continued learn-ing and one that remains surprisingly neglected both by governments andinternational organizations.The district should also train new community health workers and tradi-tional birth attendants as the need arises. The latter play a most importantrole, for not -Inly are 6o\" of all babies in some developing countriesdelivered by them, but they are also actively involved in child care (growthmonitoring, nutrition education, prevention and treatment of diarrhoea,immunization, etc.) and family planning. Hence, careful consideration mustbe given to the content of their training. For example, it is important toensure that they are able not only to carry out deliveries safely and cleanly,but also t,-.1 detect abnormal conditions in the antenatal and postnatal periodsand make appropriate referrals. As to the place for training, should this bea hospital, a heahh centre, or the village? Insistence on training traditional BEST COPY AVAILABLE 79 lowanis a healthy dlstrIel st.

Mandelmann (15551) birth attendants in hospitals, where they are made to wear such things asmasks, aprons, and boots, has teneed to institutionalize them. Also, commu-nities may feel that, after such training, the remuneration of the birthattendant is no longer their responsibility but that of the ministry of health.This usually happens when, on returning from their orientation course,traditional birth attendants take it upon themselves to double, or evenquadruple, the',- \"expected\" remuneration. This said, some training mustnevertheless take place in a health facility so as to include supervised attend-ance at deliveries.The district may also have to organize training and/or orientation pro-grammes for special groups. Workshops on the subject of primal y health careand the school need to be organized for schoolteachers in the districts, andshould be planned in close coop _fation with the district health educationofficer and the ministry of education.Finally, the health staff need to organize orientation and/or mobilizationactivities for community leaders, youth movements, women's organizations,political parties, trade unions, and communities in general. These can be 80BEST COPY AVAILABLE Implemsntation varied: workshops, films, district health weeks, etc. Where district healthteams have worked closely with other leaders, innovative and effective pro-grammes have been developed. One such was the founding by a governor ina South Asian country, on the occasion of a religious feast, of a \"healthy life\"movement, whose objectives were \"small, happy and prosperous families; thereduction of infant and child mortality, and of the crude birth rate, throughintegrated interventions in maternal and child health, nutrition, familyplanning, immunization, diarrhoea control, and improvement of environ-mental health.\"Organizational structureTo achieve planned targets more easily, it might be necessary to change theorganizational structure of the services and to link service and managerialfunctions.In some countries, public health and curative functions at district levelare administered independently in separate units, namely the health officeand the hospital. However, in an increasing number of countries both theseunits come under the district health officer, who is based in either the hospitalor the health office. If the administration is hospital-based, the danger is thatit may be hospital-dominated, though it would also :)BEST COPY AVAILABLE81 TowardsMaltby disbict including greater potential for mobilizing hospital staff for community pro-grammes.Organization at the subdistrict level (i.e., at the health centre and sub-centre levels) will vary from country to country, depending on the numbersand types of staff deployed and on differences in health needs. The staffingpattern of peripheral health facilities will also vary greatly. A question thatoften arises is whether or not to use multipurpose workers. In sparselypopulated areas, a multipurpose worker is preferable, whereas, in denselypopulated areas, it may be more efficient to have specialized workers.Fig. 8 provides an example of an organizational structure found in somecountries. This structure facilitates the comprehensive implementation ofprimary health care. The services are divided into three categories: (I)curative, (2) maternal and child health (including immunization and nutri-tion), and (3) preventive (including environmental health, water supply, andinfectious disease control).The district primary healthcare teamThe district health management team might include the district healthofficer, a hospital doctor, a public health nurse, a public health inspector,a hospital administrator, and a finance officer. Each health facility willprobably also have its own team. Other teams in a district may include healthcentre and/or hospital advisory boards, and committees for school, village, ordistrict (health) development (see list below). The community should beadequately represented on these boards and committees. It is important toensure that the tasks of the teams are clearly defined and oriented towards theachievement of district health objectives.The following is a list of the various health teams that might be found ina district (average numbers in parentheses):District (health) development committee ( )School health committee (I)District health management team (1)District hospital advisory board (1 )District hospital management team (i )Health centre/subcentre advisory board (30)Health centre management team (30)Village (health) development committee (6o) 82 iniptemsntatIon Effective use of team membersExperience shows that a number of health care workers are capable of doingmuch more than they are doing at present. For example, with proper motiva-tion and guidance on primary health care, the health inspector could playa leading role in the improvement of environmental sanitation and theprovision of safe water. The peripheral midwife, the mainstay of maternaland child health care in many countries, with simple training could playa greater role in educating communities on how to avoid disease and onhealthy life-styles.More important still are the staff of nongovernmental organizations.Countries are for ever \"discovering\" lay or religious associations, youthclubs, or women's groups which turn out to be of the greatest assistance inthe achievement of district health targets. Also, in many countries, churchorganizations train and employ as many health workers as the ministry ofhealth. Team-building would greatly benefit from a good analysis of thestaffing situation and from a proper allocation of tasks.LeadershipLeadership means influencing others so that they achieve specific goals. It isan integral part of management. A district health officer is both a managerand leader whose main role is to achieve the goals and targets of the primaryhealth care plan. He or she may be concerned with such questions as: Howcan I get the job done? Which is the best way of doing that? What style ofleadership should I adopt, and how can I build commitment to primaryhealth care among the members of my team? When should I listen and whenshould I give orders? Will I lose the respect of my subordinates if I becomefriendly with them? 83 Towards a haaithy district Role and responsibilities of the district health officerThe district health officer may have the following managerial functions:Function Requirements and responsibilitiesFormulation of district health A clear understmding of national poi-policy ides, priorities, and constraints, aswell as district health needs and ex-pectations. Interpretation and trans-lation of national objectives intodistrict objectives, targets, and plans.Preparation of budgets as part ofoverall district health plans.

Some of the jobs that have to be done canbe assigned to a subordinate. Delegation can be encouraged by includinga specific mention of the function in the job description of the district healthofficer, e.g., assignment of work to others. SupervisionThough the supportive supervision of all health personnel is recognized as an essential factor in good management, it is often both infrequent and poor, taking the form of an \"inspection\" rather than a two-way learning process. An effort should be made to establish a supervisory system rather thanmerely organizing visits, which are only a cog in such a system. One of the main functions of supervision is to maintain and improve the quality ofhealth care.Supervision requires frequent (e.g. monthly) visits to all health facilitiesin the district. Each visit will provide information that can be used not only toallocate resources effectively, but to improve primary health care manage- ment.On-site visits can also serve to maintain or increase staff motivation.Information to be cellected should include answers to the following ques-tions:What population is served?What is the staffing pattern?What services are currently provided?What is the present coverage by various programmes?Are outreach activities currently provided?Are the logisticssupplies and equipmentadequate?How are the equipment and facilities maintained?How is the work organized? 85 Towards a haaithy district What problems hamper the current operation of the facility? How arethe staff tackling these problems?What suggestions do the staff have on how activities might be im-proved?With the immense variety of resources and types of terrain involved, greatflexibility, innovation, and imagination are needed (especially as regardslogistics) in establishing subsystems for supervision at district and subdistrictlevel. The whole effort should be based, at least initially, on the realities ofthe local situation and the resources available. Alternative ways of providingsupportive supervision need to be explored. For example, in many countries,health centres are supposed to supervise subcentres and community healthworkers. The distances involved are sometimes more than too km, and theabsence of reliable means of transport makes reasonable supervision impos-sible. In such circumstances, should supportive supervision be the responsi-bility of the district team? If so, vehicles need to be provided at district level.Or should the use of bicycles and other cheaper means of transport beencouraged? Some countries tackle the problem by holding supervisorymeetings every month, on the day when the community health workers cometo the health centre to collect drugs and discuss their problems. Similarly, theresponsible officers of health centres meet once a month at the districthospital.It goes without saying that, for effective supervision, it is important to seta good personal example. This rule, however, is not always observedwitness the case of a district health manager who was furious with hiscommunity health workers for demanding remuneration, though it was wellknown in the district that, in addition to his relatively :ligh salary, he wa,raking in considerable amounts of money from an illegal private practice. IncentivesSometimes training, redefinition of tasks, and supervision will not be enoughby ti-miselves to motivate health workers adequately. It is necessary toimprove both the status and financial rewards of all staff, partkularly thosewi-rv;ng ;n rural areas. It is unrealistic to expect good performances underdifficult conditions from workers who are poorly rewarded. A whole range ofincentives are used in different countries, for example, an annual prize for thebest district, health centre, doctor, nurse, etc; a certificate from the head ofstate for the best worker; scholarships and fellowships; salary increases forspecific achievements; subsidized housing to encourage residence in rural 86 implementation areas; and various awards for rural work, such as degrees or salary in-crements. The aim of such incentives should be to encourage a wide range ofapproaches to the task of meeting the health needs of the population. Toooften the main problem is not poor organization, inadequate management,or lack of skills, but low morale.Supplies, logistics, and maintenanceAdequate support for prirraiy health care demands efficient handling ofdrugs and supplies, includiug dieir procurement, distribution, and transport,as well as the maintenancLf buildings and equipment and, sometimes,minor construction work. \"1 he procurement of vaccines, medicines andsupplies frequently poses problems. A decision is needed as to which itemsshould be purchased regularly. Are the current organizational systems fordistribution satisfactory? Does the district health organization have enoughcontrol over them? Does the district operate an essential drugs and equip-ment list? Are storage facilities, including cold-chain facilities, available, Essential drugs are those that meet the health care needs of the majority of the population.Photo WHOA!.

Are transport facilities and equipment adequately main-tained? Where there is a shortage of motorized transport, what alternatives,such as bicycles, horses, etc., are available? These are but some of the issuesthat the district health team has to address in the area of logistics.To improve logistics, it is useful to start by reviewing the most importantfunctions such as:planning and budgetingreceiving and transportmaintenance and repaircommunicationsrecords and reporting.The steps required to fulfil these functions must be determined and itmust then be asked whether each of them can in fact be carried out. Forexample, it is worth asking:Is there a specified supply period?Are stock records up-to-date?Is the quantity of items used during the supply period known?What is the wastage rate for major items?Are there adequate stocks of requisition forms?Are there adequate staff to make requisitions and check paperwork?Have re-order levels for major stock items been established?Are reserve stocks maintained?Recording systms and checklists must be devised, so that logistic activ-ities can be regularly maintained and controlled. Fig. 9 provides an exampleof a stock record card that might he used for inventory control. Sample stock record card Financial managementThe district health team has overall responsibility for the preparation andmanagement of the budget. The hallmark of an experienced district healthofficer is the ability to use resources efficientiy. The cost of various alterna- tives needs to be worked out and taken into account when making decisions.This calls for information on unit costs, including those for hospital beds and outpatient attendance.There are three main financial considerations at district level: the ways in which resources are allocated and controlled by officials at more centrallevels; the allocation of resources within the district; and the mobilization and use of local financial resources for primary health care. District-level staffneed to ensure that the collection and expenditure of locally mobilizedresources are accounted for. Budgets allocated at higher levels will vary in the degree of flexibility with which they can be used at the district and locallevels. Greater flexibility is needed for the adequate support of local needs than for the execution of aprogramme of predetermined services.Relevant questions include the following: Can revenue and resources be raised locally and, if so, what is the best way of managing them? How far canbudgetary allocations be adjusted to local circumstances? How do the alloca- tions compare with actual expenditure? Can expenditure be transferred between budgetary allocations?There must be budgetary control. In managing plans and programmes, it is necessary to keep track of expenditure. When money is voted for projects, it will usually be divided among various lines of expenditure.

It is an essential part of the implementation phase of a programme,since it provides feedback. Its purpose is to identify immediate problems or deviations from the established plan a.id find quick practical solutions.Monitoring is based on a comparison between established norms or standards and actual performance.The sources of information used in monitoring health activities includemonthly. .quarterly, and annual reports from health centres and hospitals,data on notifiable diseases, and special surveys. The format of the reports willvary according to the nature of the activities being monitored. Table 7 showsdata that might be included in a quarterly report from a health centre. Theinclusion of information on the achievement of goals (for example, reductionsin case-fatality rates and maternal mortality) may be of some help in assessingthe quality of care.Good information systems are required for effective monitoring. Manyforms and registers are kept at local health units, but often these are not usedor analysed. Data are usually collected and passed on to higher echelons.These too are rarely, if ever, analysed. The data frequently consist of requests from individual, uncoordinated, vertical programmes, each with its ownreporting format; unfortunately, this is seldom appropriate for planning atdistrict level. Simple procedures for collecting information to be used at thelocal level and to provide feedback to other levels need to be devised. To thisend, decisions must be made about the forms and registers to be kept at thevarious units in the district. It must be emphasized that the problem is not a shortage of datathere ioften too muchbut the fact that little usefulinformation can he gleaned from them.Sources of informationMajor sources of information include: routine reporting; recording of tracerdiseases; sentinel sites; supervisory visits, and community diagnosis.9991 Towards a healthy ,:ilstrict Table 7.

Family cards or folders are used tokeep salient information, including the sex and date of birth of each familymember. Health events are recorded on a separate page. Many peripheralhealth facilities, which provide the first contact with families, also keep maps,indicating (a) catchment area, population, and population distribution; and(b) homes, schools, and streets. 92 Monitoring and control Tracer diseasesDetailed surveillance and recording of selected diseases may be more usefulthan attempting to note everything down. In this case, only the tracerdiseases are recorded in detail, others being noted only in a general way.Some of the factors to be taken into consideration in the selection of tracerdiseases or problems are:Does the disease or problem occur with sufficient frequency to allowreasonable numbers of cases to be detected?Can the harm from the disease or problem be significantly reduced byan appropriate intervention?Is successful intervention conditional on activities that can be modi-fied?Measles is an example of a possible tracer disease in many developingcountries. Immunization is an effective preventive measure. But successfulmeasles immunization depends on the viability of the vaccine, which isa sensitive indicator of the efficiency of the health system logistics in thedistrict and country and the quality of the cold chain. The coverage will alsodepend on community awareness and mobilization of resources. Finally, theseverity of measles in a community is a good indication of the nutritionalstatus of its children.Another example is anaemia, the incidence of which gives some idea of theeffectiveness of malaria control and environmental sanitation programmes.Similarly, the incidence of acute diarrhoea is a useful indicator of progress inenvironmental sanitation and diarrhoeal disease control. Table 8 showsconditions that have been used as tracers by some countries. Sentinel sitesAs well as endeavouring to improve reporting throughout the district, it maybe useful to select a few representative urban and rural facilities whosereports are particularly reliable and can be used as indicators of what ishappening in the district. Since sentinel sites are like watchmen, givinga warning of impending problems, every attempt should be made to includefacilities suspected of having difficulties in implementing the programme, sothat the worst possible situations may be monitored. Governmental andnongovernmental facilities should be involved where they serve an appre-ciable proportion of the population. Sentinel sites should be chosen to 93 Table 8.

Henrioud (12526)103BEST COPY AVAILABLE95 Towards a healthy district EstimatesThe prevalence of many endemic diseases can be assessed on the basis ofestimates from average national rates or published review data.Information should be presented in the form of graphs, bar charts, ormaps, where this is useful. For example, graphs showing the seasonal vari-ation in the number of deaths may indicate impending outbreaks of disease.Similarly, a graph indicating the percentage of eligible children vaccinatedwill show whether real progress is being made in the immunization pro-gramme. Comparisons between the data on the health situation and theavailability of health care for different geographical areas and populationgroups will make it possible to assess how far the distribution of health care isequitable.ControlControl is the managerial function that keeps the plan or programme withintolerable limits relative to its targets. Essentially, control involves the follow-ing activities:selecting indicators and milestones that reflect actual performancegathering and analysing information on the performance of projectsmeasured against plans, indicators, and timetablesestablishing the procedures for taking corrective action if excessivedeviations from the plan occur.It is important to identify what is controllable in a plan or programme.This depends on the nature and authority of the management team and therange of control tools and techniques considered. However, the chief items tobe controlled include:organization of personnelassignment of functions and responsibilitiesfinancial performance in terms of allocation and expenditureproject assets, facilities, machinery, equipment, and any capital items at the project's disposal (proper use, maintenance, repair, secur-ity, etc.)correspondence (which must be maintained, monitored, and properlyadapted to project needs and performance) Monitoring and control reports, logistics, and services, e.g., immunization.The visual presentation of data and plans, using, for example, Ganttcharts and graphs, should be encouraged. TheGantt chart (Table 9) is one ofthe simplest, yet probably the most useful, of the well-known managementcontrol devices. It is a simple horizontal bar chart showingthe beginning andend points of specific activities ortasks that are needed to carry out a pro-gramme or project. It shows at a glance the chronological relationship ofactivitieswhere they overlapor are in parallel with one another, when theystart and finish. Table 9. Use of Gantt chart for conducting a EvaluationEvaluation of the implementation of a district primary health care plan or programme is a more comprehensive form of assessment than regular monitoring. Monitoring leads to changes in plans of action; evaluation may lead to wholesale reformulation of priorities and plans. Evaluation is a sys- tematic way of learning from experience and using the lessons learned to improve current activities and promote better plans by the careful selection of alternatives for future action. This involves analysis of the different phases of a programme, its relevance, formulation, efficiency and effectiveness, and the extent of itsacceptance by all parties involved. It renders possible the reallocation of priorities andresources on the basis of changing health needs.Evaluation may not necessarily cover all aspects of primary health care, but should include the following criteria: effectiveness, equity, vfficiency, and impact:Effectiveness is an expression of the degree of attainment of thepre- determined objectives andtargets of a programme, institution, or activity seeking to reducea health problem or improve an unsatisfact-ory health situation. This factor depends on whether the various activities and measures undertaken work (efficacy) and the degree to which they are accepted by those for whom they are intended.Equity considers thecoverage of population groups and geographicalareas, distribution of resources and facilities, and effectiveness ofser- vices in differentareas. Equity in the distribution of health care depends on the extent to which different geographical areas and population groups, according to age, sex, or wealth, have access to essential services.Efficiency is an expression of the relationship between the results obtained from a healthprogramme or activity and the efforts expendedin terms of human, financial,and other resources, health processes, technology, and time. Thereason for assessing efficiency is to improveimplementation and gaina better idea of the progress made. 98 Evaluation end lemming by doing Impact is an expression of the overall effect of a programme, service, orinstitution on health and related aspects of socioeconomic develop-ment. The assessment of impact thus aims at identifying any necessarychange in the direction of health programmes, so as to replan primaryhealth care accordingly and increase its contribution to health andoverall socioeconomic development.The description of these components of evaluation would be incompletewithout some reference to the question of frequency. While the evaluationmay be a continuing process, the results have to be summarized and reportedon at given times or at specified intervals. Experience throughout the worldshows that health systems tend to be rigid, resisting change and oftencontinuing to operate in the same way year after year. Unless the functioningof the system is reviewed periodically, there is a danger that it will becomefossilized or change only in times of financial crisis. It may be easier tosummarize progress and efficiency, say, once a year, than to assess effec-tiveness, for which a longer interval may be required, since significant long-term changes in the health situation will have to be identified. An even longerperiod is likely to be needed before impact can be assessedperhaps fiveyears or more from the inception of a programme. The evaluation processThe evaluation process begins with an appraisal of the objectives of theprogramme and setting of standards. Evaluation can be carried out on each ofthe components of the district planning cycle.As regards the first component of the cyclenational policies and guid-anceit is important to evaluate the extent to which district plans andactivities conform to national policies. How effective is the national planningprocess as seen in the districts? Is decentralization adequate? Is effectiveguidance provided on options for organizing and financing health care? Howeffective and efficient is support from the national level with regard toplanning services, joint a-aim, and management?Concerning the next three componentsanalysis of the present situation,appraisal of district priorities, and setting objectives and targetsit is im-portant to know, among other things, how efficiently these processes havebeen carried out. Has optimal information been obtained? Information iscostly to collect and an excessive amount may overwhelm the system, thusobscuring important considerations. Were the costs of alternatives taken intoaccount? 99 Towardshealthy district In district action programmes, indicators for evaluation include the effi-cient utilization of health care, the equitable distribution of such care, andthe technical efficiency of health services. Overutilization is evidenced byunnecessarily high figures for per capita consumption of drugs, hospitaladmissions, performance of certain surgical procedures, and professionalconsultations per year. Underutilization occurs either because the servicesare unwanted and thus bypassed, or because the supply exceeds the demand.Table 10 provides further examples of criteria for evaluation. Levels ofperformance in mceting these criteria could be classed as: (I) standardsconsistently met; (2) standards often met; (3) standards sometimes met; (4)standards occasionally met; and (5) standards not met.The best districtA number of countries regularly award prizes to the best district and/ordistrict health officer and other health workers. This appears to be anexcellent way of improving the functioning of district health systems, espe-cially if the selection of winners is done in public, using explicit criteria. Thecriteria and standards given in Table io, modified as necessary, might beuseful in this exercise. Both qualitative and quantitative indicators are used,and tht decision will depend on which fr....tures of district health systems areto be emphasized in the assessment. Table to. Standards for the evaluation of a district health system 1. Plan of action. There should be a district plan of action with all the following features:It is based on a systematic assessment of the existing situation.The process of development allowed for wide consultation.It is reviewed annually.Clear priorities and targets have been established.Costs have been estimated.It provides the following:curative services, including quality control-maternal and child health services, including immunization and family planninghealthpromotion services, services for the prevention and control of communi-cable and noncommunicable diseasesenvironmental and occupational health servicesoutreach prpgrammes. 100 Evaluation and taitmIng by doing Table to (contd.)2. Joint action. There should be:a multisectoral district advisory committee or a subcommittee of the district develop-ment committee, which meets regularly and keeps minutes of decisionsmultisectoral village development committees where health matters are discussedcooperation with nongovernmental organizations and with religious and politicalorganizationscooperation with traditional birth aftendantscooperation with other traditional practitionerscooperation with communities in the selection of community health workers.3. Improved management. There should be:a chart of the organizational structure that is easily availablea star ng tablea lir( t 4 essential equipment and drugs for all unitsan effcrt to attain at least national norms for staffing levelsjob descriptions for all staff categoriesregular meetings of the district management team, with minutes availablerefresher courses for all staff at least once every three yearsa staff incentive programmea chronological record of expenditureavailability of drugs and other essential supplies throughout the yearavailability of essential means of transport.4. Monitoring. There should be:district monthly reports (available by the middle of the subsequent month)reports by all health units (available by the middle of the subsequent month)visual presentation of information.5. Evaluation and learning by doing. There should be:an evaluation committee to assess progress and programme qualityestablished methods of assessment and standardsquarterly meetings of the committeefollow-up of the committee's findingssystematic action to find solutions to difficulties encountered in the district.6. Impact. This is reflected in:improved organization and management of district health systems (1-5 above)increased coverage with essential care.Findings could be recorded as follows:percentage of population within 5 km of a health facilitypercentage of female population who are literate ,1 \"101 Towards a healthy district Table to (contd.) percentage of population with clean water in compound or within 15 minutes' walkpercentage of houses (families) with latrinespercentage of mothers receiving care during first three months of pregnancypercentage of mothers attended at childbirth by trained health workerpercentage of children fully immunizedpercentage of eligible couples who are practising family planningdacrease in percentage of newborns with weight less than 2500 gpercentage decrease in morbidity and mortality from major endemic diseasespercentage decrease in infant mortality ratepercentage decrease in maternal mortalitydecrease in percentage of inequities in health and health care between geographicalareas and population groups. Learning by doingThe purpose of evaluation, as described above, is to determine the extent towhich programmes and services are actually working and achieving opera-tional targets and results in terms of health. Often, however, the likely effectsof new programmes and methods of delivering care are not at all clear. Underthese circumstances, some research may be needed to determine the mostappropriate way forward. For example, to what extent should village healthworkers be provided with drugs to dispense to the local population? Theanswer to this question might be obtained by setting up a trial in whichdifferent ranges of drugs are given to groups of village health workers, andthen assessing how appropriately they prescribe them and how well thepatients comply with their instructions. To help evaluation, studies of thisnature can be carried out on an ad hoc basis in preselected areas.An unfortunate tendency in health care is for outside \"experts\" to claimthat the appropriate solutions are known and that the challenge is one ofimplementation. If, for example, the government is not providing sufficientfunds for primary health care, this is said to be due to lack of political will.Training is the usual answer to poor performance by community healthworkers at health centres or hospitals. A sense of humility is needed, togetherwith a willingness to acknowledge that a gap between expert opinion andpeople's traditional wisdom is a problem. 102flu Evaluation and laming by doing Operational researchOperational research often has wide relevance and applicability and, if de-signed and carried out adequately, may be applicable to a number of districts.Indeed, since such research is time-consuming, it is imperative that districtsshould learn from studies carried out elsewhere. In some countries it may beuseful to have selected areas or districts which, together with supportinginstitutions and experts at the national level, could undertake practicalresearch. In fact, a number of such districts already exist in different parts ofthe world. These are not pilot districts in the usual sense.It is essential that the provision of technical cooperation to selected areasor districts, whether by national institutions or from external sources, shouldbe channelled in such a way that there is no risk of their becoming so differentfrom other areas thai the lessons learnt will be inapplicable to the rest of thecountry. The research should be continued for a specific period of time, sothat if a new initiative is shown to be unsuccessful, it can be abandoned andnot implemented elsewhere. New initiatives often become self-fulfilling andare adopted widely without any real evaluation of the benefit to the popula-tion.Some of the innovations to be introduced in the selected districtsforexample, comprehensive maternal and child health clinics or the deploymentof community health workersmay already have been attempted with vary-ing degrees of success in other districts. But such innovations ar r. rarely, ifever, subjected to rigorous experimental assessment. It is this essentialelement, the equivalent of the randomized clinical trial of medical pro-cedures, which is being stressed here. The precise forms of innovation to betried will vary from time to time; they should all be monitored anddocumented, and the information obtained made available to other districts.Without this approach, change will be based only on intuition and learningwill be difficult.The following are examples of areas in which studies may be required:Is it possible to develop resource allocation methods that promotea better use of resources in relation to population needs? Among otherthings, it is important to know the present pattern of expendituregovernmental, private, nongovernmental, etc.as well as the overallfinancial resources of the health sector in the district.How can a districtwide health information system be developed whichcould help to define the problems of the population and supportdecision-making at all levels of the health services, including hospitals? 1 1 1 103 Towards a healthy district This question calls for detailed studies of the strengths and weaknessesof the present system.How can priority-setting be related more closely to the impact ofvarious interventions?How can the first-referral hospital become more fully linked with otherfacilities in the district health system?What would be a more efficient system of health care delivery?What types of health unit should be in the system? Should there behealth centres, subcentres, and dispensaries, or health centres only?What is the optimum staffing pattern?How should maternal and child health and the control of malaria,tuberculosis, and leprosy be integrated with primary health care?How can the organization of services within units, e.g., the flow ofpatients, be improved?Are services reaching those in need? Who uses them and why?How can services keep up with ever-changing patterns of ill-health?How can supervision be improved?Such studies should facilitate monitoring and evaluation and permitrecommendations for the strengthening of district services to be made on thebasis of sound evidence that they are worth while. Districts can then adoptnew strategies that are known to work, to improve primary health care. 104 References 1. Glossary of terms used in the \"Health for All\" Series No. 1-8.
