The most active pro-ponent is the Association of American Medical Colleges; the AmericanMedical Association, the federal Council on Graduate Medical Education,and health philanthropies like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation ad-vocate racial preferences as well. Their goal is not necessarily to promotediversity for its own sake but to improve the health of minority patients.Support for afrmative action programs has indeed become a test of med-ical schools' commitment to minority health. \"This is not a quota born outof a sense of equity or distribution of justice, but a principle that the besthealth care may need to be delivered by those that fully understand acultural tradition,\" said George Mitchell, the former Senate majority leaderand the chairman of the Pew Health Professions Commission. 1 It is now claimed that a mismatch in race between doctor and patient\u2014 especially when the doctor is white and the patient is not\u2014may be enoughto trigger subtle, or not so subtle, biases that result in second-rate medicaltreatment and poorer health. In 1999 the U.S. Civil CommissionHoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 the health care sys- tem.2No less an authoritative voice than the American Medical Associa- tion's ofcial newspaper has claimed that \"a growing body of researchreports that racial discrepancy in health status can be explained, at least inpart, by racism and discrimination in the health care system itself.\" 3This is why, according to the Reverend Al Sharpton, health will become the\"new civil rights battlefront,\" a prediction echoed by other black leaders,including the Reverend Jesse Jackson and NAACP Chairman Julian Bond. 4 President Clinton himself has spoken of race and health. \"Nowhere are the divisions of race and ethnicity more sharply drawn than in the healthof our own people,\" he said in a 1998 radio address delivered during BlackHistory Month. It is indeed true that black Americans have higher infantmortality rates, more death from cancer, and lower life expectancies thanwhites and Asians. But it is far less certain that one of the possible expla-nations put forth by the president\u2014\"discrimination in the delivery ofhealth care services\"\u2014is accurate. 5 Given the history of systematic racial discrimination and segregation in the health care system, residual bias seems, at rst, plausible. Indeed,medicine, like other institutions, once practiced overt discrimination. Blackpatients were treated on separate and inferior hospital wards\u2014a policy thatpersisted among many hospitals in the Deep South until 1968. Black phy-sicians were once routinely barred from joining hospital staffs and medicalsocieties and started their own institutions to treat other blacks who weredenied adequate care by the white-controlled medical facilities. 6A partic- ularly frightening episode in medical research was the unethical TuskegeeSyphilis Study. Decades later, however, accusations of medical bias still linger. Ac- cording to Vanessa Northington Gamble, a physician and director of theDivision of Community and Minority Programs at the Association ofAmerican Medical Colleges, \"Tuskegee symbolizes for many African-Amer-icans the racism that pervades American institutions, including the medicalprofession.\" 7 But the known facts suggest other interpretations of dif-Hoover Press disparities\"), and I shall present some of them here. This is not to minimize the facts of real discrepancies in access to care,certain medical procedures (even with insurance coverage), and in disease rates by race. 8But I intend to show that they cannot be convincingly traced to bias against minority patients. My second aim is to look critically at oneprogram intended to help close the health gap: racial preferences in medicalschool admissions. Do Physicians Treat Minority Patients Differently? A study in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1999 described differences in treatment of lung cancer between black and whitepatients who were beneciaries of Medicare insurance. 9In a careful analysis, Peter B. Bach and his colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Cen-ter in New York City looked at records of more than 10,000 patients whoreceived diagnoses of operable lung cancer. Seventy-seven percent of thewhite patients underwent surgery compared with 64 percent of the blacks.Five years after diagnosis, only one-quarter of black patients were still alivecompred with one-third of whites. What accounted for the different rates of surgery? Did doctors not suggest the treatment as often to their black patients, or did these patientsmore often choose to forgo the recommendation for surgery? Were theblack patients more likely to have poor lung function, such as more carbondioxide buildup, or other problems that would have prohibited surgery orcontributed to earlier demise? Details like these would go a long way towardexplaining why surgery was never offered and why death rates differed, butthose were not the questions that Bach and his colleagues set out to answer. 10 Indeed, the authors specically said they could not offer an explanationbased on the kinds of data they collected. Other physicians, however, were ready with hypotheses. \"Possibly, physicians are treating cancer patients not just based upon their illnessand recommended treatment, but on the basis of their Press : Thernstrom Stallworth of the American Cancer Society.11Dr. Harold Free- man, a surgeon and president of North General Hospital in Harlem, won-dered whether white doctors might have been more scrupulous in gettingwhite patients to accept surgery. \"If you [as a doctor] were dealing withsomebody who looked exactly like you, would you take another step?\" heasked. 12A more emphatic reaction greeted a report in the Annals of Emer- gency Medicine that found that 74 percent of white patients with fractures received pain medication compared with 57 percent of black patients.13\"I think it's racism, flat out,\" said Dr. Lewis Goldfrank, director of emergencyservices at Bellevue Hospital in New York City. 14 Responses like these would not surprise John Landsverk of Children's Hospital in San Diego. As he observed: \"The usual implication of suchdisparities [in treatment rates] is that the health care system is biased againstpersons of the ethnic minority group and that the bias is likely to be foundeven in professional clinicians' perceptions of clinical problems and [re-ferrals for] clinical procedures.\" 15In light of this, Landsverk was especially enthusiastic about a study by a group of doctors at the University ofPittsburgh that found no race-related differences in treatment of childrenwith behavioral problems. 16Their report appeared in the journal Medical Care one month after Bach's study, but it attracted no public attention. It should have; it was \"an important non-nding,\" as Landsverk noted in anaccompanying editorial in the same journal. Not only did the Pittsburghstudy include a very large sample\u2014almost 15,000 children treated in clinicsacross the country and Canada\u2014but also, most important, the researchersinterviewed the parent and doctor of every patient. The results: race and ethnicity of the child had no relationship to clinician patterns in drugprescribing, referral, or diagnosis of behavioral problems. The cliniciansalso spent slightly more time with minority children than with their white counterparts. This handful of studies is emblematic of the challenges inherent in interpreting health disparities research. First, the vast majority of treatmentdisparity studies are what scientists call \"retrospective.\" That is, the rawdata already exist in hospital records, and researchers use them (in retro-Hoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page130 Satelspect) when they want to explore a specic question (e.g., are there more visits to emergency rooms on nights with a full moon?). The disadvantageof this approach is that key questions cannot be asked directly of the verypeople being studied: for example, did subjects in the study want or refusea specic treatment? Did physicians offer it, and if not, why? Second, asLandsverk's reaction to the University of Pittsburgh study suggests, theabsence of alleged racial bias does not make news. Consider the following example of a study that made a media splash the rst time around. A Misdiagnosed Case of Physician Bias We know that black persons generally undergo cardiac cath- eterization less frequently than whites. Catheterization is a procedure usedto discern whether there is blockage in the coronary arteries, the vesselsthat feed blood to the heart itself, and therefore whether the patient is atrisk for a heart attack. The delicate process involves introducing a catheterinto an artery in the leg and threading it upward toward the heart. Whenit reaches the point were the coronary arteries branch off, dye is squirtedand the arterial patterns show up on a real-time X-ray. This is generallythe rst step in determining whether the vessels can be opened wider via atiny balloon or whether some or all of the vessels must be replaced in abypass operation. Struck by the observation that black patients undergo catheterization less often than whites, Dr. Kevin A. Schulman and others at GeorgetownUniversity Medical Center wanted to examine how doctors made theirdecisions to refer patients for the procedure. 17The researchers recruited 720 general internists at medical conventions and asked them to participatein a study of clinical decision making. The internists were not told that aprimary purpose of the study was to explore how the race and sex of thepatient might affect those decisions, nor were they told that the researchersexpected to nd that African Americans (and women) would be referredfor cardiac catheterization less frequently than white men. The doctors watched videotapes of actors wearing dressing gowns andHoover Press : Thernstrom Health and Medical Careanswering questions posed to them by an interviewer who elicited their complaints about chest pain and other relevant medical and personal his-tory, including their insurance status. All the questions asked of the actorsand their responses, down to the gestures used to describe the symptoms,were scripted to minimize inconsistencies. Overall, the doctors, who weremostly white, viewed 144 different videotapes, one for every possible com-bination of race, sex, and age and including differing clinical variables likethe nature of the chest pain and the patient's stress test and EKG results. The physicians were asked whether the patients' complaints appeared to reflect heart disease or another kind of distress, such as indigestion, andto rate the likelihood that the pain was indeed heart-related. As it turnedout, all eight groups received similar ratings, leading the authors to assumethe doctors would also refer for catheterization at similar rates. Yet, ac-cording to Schulman, \"women and blacks were signicantly less likely tobe referred for catheterization than white men.\" About 9 percent of thewhite men were not referred versus 15 percent of the women and blackpatients. If representative of actual clinical outcomes, Schulman said, thiswould mean that blacks and women \"were 40 percent less likely to bereferred.\" Schulman misspoke, however: what it really would have meantwas that white men had a 40 percent lower chance of notbeing referred. Quite a difference. These ndings were presented in an article titled, \"The Effect of Race and Sex on Physicians' Recommendations for Cardiac Catheterization,\" published in the New England Journal of Medicine in the winter of 1999. In the article Schulman and his associates speculated: Our ndings that the race and sex of the patient influence the recommen- dations of physicians independently of other factors may suggest bias on thepart of the physicians. However, our study could not assess the form of bias.Bias may represent overt prejudice on the part of physicians, or, more likely,could be the result of subconscious perceptions rather than deliberate actionsor thoughts. Subconscious bias occurs when a patient's membership in atarget group automatically activates a cultural stereotype in the physician'smemory regardless of the level of prejudice the physician has. 18Hoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page132 SatelThe study was a media sensation. On ABC's World News This Morning , Juju Chang told viewers: \"How your doctor treats your heart may dependon the color of your skin. . . . The bias shows up in the diagnosis anddoctors don't even realize it.\" 19Peter Jennings predicted that the study would make \"political waves\" because it showed that \"prejudice amongdoctors causes a gap in the quality of health care between blacks andwhites.\" 20OnNightline , Ted Koppel set up the story like this: \"Last night we told you how the town of Jasper, Texas, is coming to terms\" with theracially motivated murder of a black man; \"Tonight we will focus on[doctors] who would be shocked to learn that what they do routinely tsquite easily into the category of racist behavior.\" 21Newspaper headlines echoed the theme: \"Cardiac Testing: Study Finds Women, Blacks Are BeingShortchanged,\" the Chicago Tribune said. 22\"Health Care: It's Better If You're White,\" announced the Economist .23The articles repeated Schul- man's statement that black patients were 40 percent less likely to be referred. Some of the most intense\u2014indeed, self-flagellating\u2014reactions came from the medical profession itself. An editorial in The Lancet , Britain's foremost medical journal, saw the ndings as being \"as close to a denitionof institutionalized racism as doctors and health care providers may dareto get.\" 24Aubrey Lewis, a Long Island cardiologist, warned on Nightline that \"if this [physician bias] continues on, you're looking at literally adecimation of the African-American population.\" 25 A Second Sober Look at Schulman's Study A revelation came six months after the Schulman study ap- peared when the New England Journal of Medicine , the same journal that had printed Schulman's study, published a powerful rebuttal. This analysiswas by Lisa M. Schwartz, Steven Woloshin, and M. Gilbert Welch, allphysicians at the White River Junction Veterans Administration Hospitalin Vermont, who reanalyzed Schulman's data to show that the averagereferral rates for three of the four groups were in fact the same. 26WhiteHoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page133 133 Health and Medical Caremen, white women, and black men were all referred at the rate of 9 in 10; only black women, for unclear reasons, had a lower referral rate, about 8in 10. Put another way, black women were 87 percent as likely as whitewomen and men of both races to be referred for catheterization. And blackmen were treated just as aggressively as both white men and white women. The doctors from White River Junction also expressed dismay at what might be called the statistical sleight-of-hand that supported the Schulmanhypothesis of physician referral bias. \"The probability of referral for blackswas 7 percent lower. . . . These exaggerations serve only to fuel anger and undermine the trust between physicians and their patients,\" the WhiteRiver Junction doctors wrote. They were not alone in expressing concern;theNEJM editors published a note in the very same issue regretting that they had not required the authors to use more straightforward statisticalmeasures. \"We take responsibility for the media's over-interpretation of[this] article,\" they admitted. 27 Even after seeing how his ndings had been interpreted by the press and used to goad racial resentments, Schulman would not budge. \"Ourstudy wil l... encourage the medical profession to seek ways to eliminate unconscious bias that may influence physicians' clinical decisions,\" hemaintained. 28Also sticking with Schulman' Paul lass, a cardiologist at Morehouse School of Medicine. \"You argue withstatistics all day,\" he told USA Today; \"we have to face the reality of our situation: There is a gender and racial bias.\" 29Compared with the tidal wave of coverage triggered by the Schulman study, the article by Schwartzand her colleagues generated a mere trickle of media interest, as noted bycolumnist John Leo and the media magazine Brill's Content . 30 Alternative Explanations for Differences in Treatment Accusations of bias make headlines. Less catchy are the mun- dane but meaningful explanations that are more faithful to the clinicalsituations that doctors and patients face every day. A judicious approachHoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page134 134 Sally Satelto the topic has been adopted by the Kaiser Family Foundation. \"Even when differences persist, it should be noted that every differential in careis not necessarily a problem,\" says a 1999 foundation report, \"and that thelevel of care obtained by whites may not be the appropriate standard forcomparison.\" 31 One reason, for example, that procedure rates differ is that medical problems do not necessarily occur with the same frequency across races.Consider: Uterine broid tumors, and thus hysterectomies, are more com-mon in black women than in whites, while osteoporosis-related fractures,and thus hip replacement, are rarer. Limb amputation is more commonamong black patients because thicker atherosclerosis of the blood vesselsin the leg makes it harder to perform limb-saving surgery. 32African Amer- icans suffer stroke at many times the rate of whites, yet undergo a procedureto unclog arteries in the neck (endarterectomy) only one-fourth as often.Racism? Unlikely. It turns out that whites tend to have their obstructionsin the large, supercial carotid arteries of the neck region that are readilyaccessible to surgery. Blacks tend to have their blockages in the branchesof the carotids. These smaller branches run deeper and farther up into thehead where the surgeon cannot reach them. 33 Another consideration is the clinical condition of the patient. Does he have other medical problems that alter the risk-to-benet ratio of a pro-cedure, making it less favorable? The treatment of heart disease, for ex-ample, often needs to be modied in the presence of uncontrolled highblood pressure and diabetes\u2014conditions more typical of black patientswith heart disease than of white patients. 34 Then there is the site of care itself. Some hospitals, for example, simply do not offer certain cardiac procedures. Dr. Lucian L. Leape and his col-leagues at the Harvard Medical School found that about one-quarter of allpatients needing cardiac procedures failed to get them, in large part becausethey were admitted to hospitals that did not offer them. Notably, Leapefound that failure to undergo procedure occurred at equal rates across allgroups of patients\u2014black, white, and Hispanic. 35 Conversely, under systems of available medical care in the United StatesHoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 and Medical affairs medical centers, the military services), some differ- ences in treatment melt away. For example, patients with colorectal and prostate cancer treated in those systems showed no race-related differences in treatment availability, treatment methods, or survival rates. Yet in other instances, even with good health insurance coverage, African American patients may have a lower chance of receiving certain procedures.36If money is not an issue in those instances, then the difference in treatmentmust represent bias on the part of the doctors, say those who are quick to charge bias when outcomes differ by race. As we've seen, this charge makes very lively headlines. But a different interpretation is plausible: that the patients' clinical needs rather than thedoctors' personal biases are dictating the care. After all, if not for concernabout the patient, why wouldn't physicians perform a reimburseable pro-cedure? The factors discussed so far are only some of the determinants of whether patients undergo procedures. We must also consider patients'attitudes toward care. For example, what is the nature of a person's beliefin his susceptibility to disease, the seriousness with which he perceivesdisease, and his condence that treatment will work? 37Social scientists call this the health belief model. Culturally influenced ideas about illness alsoplay a role in patients' decisions to refuse or delay screening tests andinterventions. Fatalistic attitudes toward the value of preventive care andthe outcomes of disease as well as magical thinking (e.g., that the devil cancause cancer, that mammography machines cause breast cancer) and theuse of folk remedies are more prevalent in minority groups. 38 Says Lorna G. Canlas, a nurse with an East Harlem clinic that cares for a Latino population, \"Most clients I encounter need to be persuaded of thevalidity and utility of modern medical practices. 39Other studies have doc- umented a greater aversion to surgery among African American patientscompared with whites, even when the white patients' perceptions of currenthealth state, level of education, and age were all taken into account. 40Hoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page136 136 Sally SatelA Hasty Allegation of Bias Kidney transplantation has come under scrutiny of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in its 1999 report as a case of \"health careinequity,\" in part because African American patients spend considerablymore time on the waiting list for a new kidney than do white patients. 41 This means that they spend more time on the dialysis machine\u2014a thrice-weekly, hours-long process that cleans the blood of toxic products. Theideal treatment is kidney transplantation, but the process is a complicatedone. Before a patient can receive a kidney, there must be attempts to\"match\" the donor with the recipient so that the recipient's immune systemdoes not attack, or \"reject,\" the new kidney. The better the match ofbiological variables, the better the outcome. According to a report issuedby the UNOS Histocompatibility Committee, black recipients wait longerowing to factors such as blood type, sensitization, and some antigens(immune proteins made by the cells). 42 A technique called antigen matching is used to test for different com- binations of six major antigens found on tissues. A perfect six-out-of-sixmatch is the ideal condition for compatibility between donor and recipient.Unfortunately, a complete match is far less common in African Americantransplant candidates than in whites because they have more possible an-tigen combinations than whites and some of those antigens are very rarein the general population. Scientists are still debating the precise physiology of organ rejection and the importance of near-perfect antigen matching. What they do knowis that black transplant recipients are more likely to reject their new kidneys.Possible reasons include poor control of hypertension or a more vigorousimmune response. 43Even well-matched transplants can be lost to rejection, suggesting that the standard antigen-matching system may be too simplis-tic. 44Clearly, we need a better understanding of transplant immunology so that we can develop new and better medications to prevent rejection.45 Meanwhile, if the compatibility is marginal, it is sometimes most prac-Hoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page137 137 Health and Medical Caretical for the physician to have the patient stay on dialysis longer to wait for a better match. Losing scarce organs to rejection from mismatch actuallymakes the recipient more likely to reject future kidneys. Also, every rejectedkidney means one less donor kidney available to the other people on thewaiting list. This is a critical point because donor kidneys are among thenation's scarcest resources. In 1996, for example, more than 70,000 Amer-icans began dialysis for severe renal disease, but only 12,000 received trans-plants. 46 Most patients on dialysis, especially black persons, get their organs from donors that are deceased, so called cadaveric donors. Once on thewaiting list, how do black patients fare in the allocation of kidneys fromcadavers? In 1997 black patients represented one-third of the waiting listfor cadaveric kidneys and, as a group, donated 11 percent of all cadaverickidneys and received 27 percent of them. Thus, more than half of all kidneysreceived by black transplant recipients came from donors of other races(predominately white). Donation is a gift of life that transcends racial score-keeping\u2014but it is important to look closely at the numbers when bias inallocation of kidneys is alleged. Rationale for Afrmative Action in Medical School Whether the quality of health care for minority patients truly depends upon producing greater numbers of minority physicians is anunresolved empirical question. Nonetheless, proponents of racial prefer-ences in medical school admissions contend that white physicians treatwhite patients better than minority patients, with whom, it is said, theyhave difculty developing a rapport. 47To be sure, understanding a patient's cultural tradition is important, but need one actually be a product of thattradition to be sufciently sensitive to a patient? Virtually all the majormedical organizations say yes. Foremost among them is the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). 48When California and Texas were planning to Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 Satelpreferences in 1996, the AAMC formed Health Professionals for Diversity, a coalition of major medical, health, and educational associations, to lobbyfor the preservation of preferences. By the time Initiative 200, the Wash-ington State referendum to prohibit preferences by race, ethnicity, or gen-der in public institutions, was on the ballot in 1998, the coalition includedfty-one associations among its membership. According to an associationvice president, the true message of race-neutral policy to minority studentswas: \"We don't want you.\" 49 Given the relatively small numbers of black, Hispanic, and Native American physicians (3 percent, 5 percent, and less than 1 percent of thenation's medical workforce, respectively), compounded by the decliningnumber of minority applicants in the late 1990s, many feel that medicalschools need to rely on racial preferences if they are to boost these numbersin the next few years. 50(Asian Americans are not considered a minority because they are well represented among practicing physicians: 10 percentversus 4 percent of the general population.) Racial preferences played a role in raising rst-year enrollment to the point where, by 1999, it had reached 8 percent black and about 7 percentHispanic, though it remains 1 percent Native American. 51But recruitment has been difcult. In 1995, when racial preferences in medical schools werenearly universal, only about 12 percent of rst-year students were black,Hispanic, or Native American. The recruitment challenge was characterizedby Robert G. Petersdorf, former president of the AAMC, as follows: \"Wecannot produce underrepresented minority medical students if there is aninsufcient number who are applying to our schools, graduating fromcollege, or even nishing high school with sufcient skills to enable themto survive a premedical course of study.\" 52Nonetheless, by 2010 the AAMC hopes to attain racial and ethnic representation among physicians that isin proportion to the general population. The impact of race-neutral policies in some states will make the 2010 parity goal even more elusive. Within two years after Proposition 209 passedin 1996, there was a 29 percent drop in applications by minorities to sixpublic medical schools in California. 53This set alarm bells Press : Thernstrom 21-01-01 rev2 and Medical Careout the medical establishment. \"There is a national health need for physi- cians who, after the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, for example, are trusted bylarge segments of our population,\" wrote Michael J. Scotti Jr. of the Amer-ican Medical Association. \"It would be deplorable,\" he went on, \"if medicalschools were not permitted to consider the needs of patients when deter-mining their criteria for selecting the best qualied applicants.\" 54H. Jack Geiger, a professor of public health at the City University of New York, inan essay in the American Journal of Public Health , \"Ethnic Cleansing in the Groves of Academe,\" foresaw these \"reversals in minority admissions [as]merely the leading edge of a potential public health disaster.\" 55A public health disaster? Only if there is nothing more important to Americansabout their doctors than race. Caring Trumps Color Only a handful of studies have been devoted to the question of whether patients' outcomes are better if they and their doctors are ofthe same race. Many of these studies were conducted with psychiatricpatients, and the majority show that the clinician's race has very little todo with how black and white patients fare in their treatment and recovery. 56 According to a 1994 Harris poll for the Commonwealth Fund called Health Care Services and Minority Groups, race does not play an especiallylarge role in patients' attitudes about their doctors. When asked to cite the\"things that influence your choice of doctor,\" the physician's \"nationality/race/ethnicity\" ranked twelfth out of thirteen possible options; just 5 per-cent of whites and 12 percent of minorities said it was important. A greaterportion of Asians, 28 percent, rated race/ethnicity as important, probablybecause of language barriers. Even so, over 60 percent of white, black, andHispanic respondents said they did not consider the doctor's ability tospeak their language particularly relevant to their choice of doctor. 57 For the entire group of 4,000 respondents, factors such as ease of getting an appointment, the convenience of ofce location, and the doctor's rep-utation were most influential, cited by about two-thirds of respondents.When respondents who expressed dissatisfaction with their Press Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page140 140 Sally Satelwere asked for details, only Asians claimed that race or ethnicity was the problem (and the percentage was small, only 8 percent of all Asian respon-dents). Among the subset of the entire sample who said they \"did not feelwelcome\" at their doctors' ofces, a mere 2 percent of African Americansand Hispanics attributed the discomfort to racial/ethnic differences. 58 The main complaint of almost all groups was \"failure to spend enough time with me.\" And of those who were so dissatised that they changeddoctors, only 3 percent of Asians and 2 percent of blacks did so on thebasis of the physician's race or ethnicity. The most common complaintswere \"lack of \"didn't like him or or \"didn't trust his or her judgment.\" Less than one percent ofpeople polled said that they felt limited in their options for care because ofracial or ethnic discrimination. Thus, in this era of managed care's fteen-minute doctor visit, what much of the research on attitude really tells us is that most patients attachmore value to the amount of time they can spend with their doctors thanthey do to the doctor's race or ethnicity. When patients see a differentdoctor each time they go to the clinic, as is often the case with municipalclinic patients and those whose HMOs have high turnover, it is even harderto establish comfort and trust. Academic Performance and Racial Preferences Acceptance rates for minority students to medical schools have long been higher than rates for white and Asian applicants with similarqualications, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges.In 1979, for example, a minority student with high grades and board scoreshad a 90 percent chance of being admitted to medical school, while a whiteapplicant with comparable qualications had a 62 percent chance. By 1991,the last year for which AAMC has published data, the gures were 90percent versus 75 percent. And a low-scoring minority applicant had a 30percent chance of admission, while a similarly low scoring white applicanthad a 10 percent chance.Hoover Press : Thernstrom rev2 page141 141 Health and Medical CareAt the University of South Florida College of Medicine, for example, between 1995 and 1997, black applicants with a B /H11001grade-point average had a roughly 13 percent chance of admission, whereas white and Hispanicapplicants with the same grade-point average had only a 4 to 5 percentchance. 59Even with the passage of Proposition 209 in 1996 in California, minority applicants to some of California's public medical schools weretwo to almost three times as likely to be admitted as whites and Asians withconsiderably higher grades. 60 Notwithstanding the clear race-based advantages in admission to med- ical schools, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights charged discrimination,noting a \"persistent yet baffling denial of the social, economic, and histor-ical realities depriving our profession of minority physicians.\" 61True, many minority students have suffered unfairly in second-rate primary and sec-ondary schools, but medical school seems a risky point in the academicpipeline at which to give an academic break. Sadly, black and Hispanic applicants, who are favored in medical school admissions, also are overrepresented among students who encounter trou-ble in medical school. According to the AAMC, they are more likely thanother students to repeat their rst year or to drop out. 62Of the medical school class admitted in 1989, over 20 percent of minority students did notgraduate four years later, as is typical, with the class of 1993; of white andAsian students in the same class, only 8 percent failed to graduate. 63In 1996 the picture worsened across the board: 39 percent of minority studentswere unable to keep pace compared with 15 percent of nonminority stu-dents. 64A 1994 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that in 1988 51 percent of black medical students failed Part 1 of the National Medical Boards (taken after the second year ofmedical school), more than four times the 12 percent rate of white students.(Failure rates for Hispanic students were 34 percent, and for Asians, 16percent.) 65 The typical path for students after graduating from medical school is application to residency programs in a chosen specialty. At this level, too,there are different outcomes. \"It has been documented consistently overthe past decade that a higher proportion of underrepresented minorityHoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 positions through [the stan- dard process],\" wrote Gang Xu of Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphiaand colleagues. 66Moreover, for the period 1996-1999, the yearly dismissal rate for black residents in residency programs (14.4 percent) was almostdouble that for other groups (7.7 percent). 67Reasons for dismissal can include persistently unprofessional behavior, chronic absenteeism, and lackof aptitude or interest. These problems encountered by black and Hispanic medical students are the result of admitting students who are underqualied. When blackstudents were compared with whites who had similar academic credentials,the failure rates were similarly low. 68A 1987 study by the RAND Corpo- ration found that only about half of black physicians obtained board cer-tication compared with 80 percent of white physicians. Yet African Amer-icans were more likely than white physicians to obtain \"board certication\" in a recognized medical specialty if their grades in college and on theMedical College Admissions Test were strong enough to get them admittedon a competitive basis in the rst place. 69 Though the subject deserves more research, a handful of studies have linked medical school performance with the quality of the physician pro-duced. Robyn Tamblyn of McGill University and colleagues found thatlicensing examination scores were signicant predictors of whetherCanadian physicians sought consultations from specialists, prescribed ap-propriately, and ordered screening mammograms for female patients aged50-69. Given Canada's universal health insurance, these referral and med-icating patterns were unlikely to have been influenced by patients' abilityto pay. 70Another study, among American doctors, found that passing grades on the test to become a specialist (e.g., a cardiac surgeon, a neurol-ogist) and the scores received on the internal medical licensing exam cor-related with ratings of performance in practice by fellow doctors. 71 An Honest Debate Instituting racial preferences toward the goal of diversity for its own sake or in the spirit of compensation for historical mistreatmentHoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 and Medical Careare philosophical abstractions for debate in courtrooms, classrooms, and legislatures. But instituting preferences in order to enhance minority healthis a practical proposition that can actually be tested using real-world data.Thus far, in my view, the case has yet to be made that improving minorityhealth depends on having more minority doctors. Racial preferences would seem, for several resons, to be an inefcient way to increase the number of minority doctors\u2014and, thus, minorityhealth. First, simply put, minority representation over the last decade hasbeen fairly stagnant in spite of aggressive admissions policies. Second,minority recruitment has resulted in a two-tiered system of academic stan-dards for admission that has created attendant problems of fairness to otherpotential medical students and of propelling some students into a careerfor which they are ill prepared. Third, we lack compelling evidence thatsame-race (minority) doctor-patient relationships result in better patientoutcomes. No matter who treats our nation's poor and minority patients, we must recognize that they tend to have multiple, chronic medical conditions andare often clinically complicated. They need the best doctors they can get,regardless of race. Not enough doctors choose to work in rural communityclinics and poor, inner-city neighborhoods; moreover, in a number of statessuch as Florida, Illinois, North Dakota, Texas, and New York graduates offoreign medical schools represent one-fourth to one-half of the physicianworkforce in underserved areas. 72California has approved legislation re- quiring its public medical schools to increase the number of training slotsfor primary-care physicians and to decrease slots for specialists. 73Other approaches use creative nancial incentives (e.g., loan forgiveness, rentrebates, higher pay) to draw young doctors into rural and inner-city com-munities. We should be capitalizing on these strategies, not lowering stan-dards for admission to medical school. 74As far as patient preferences are concerned, again it would make more sense to create mechanisms thatensure patient choice than to open the doors of medical schools to unpre-pared students. Finally, we must not forget that the physician is part of a larger networkHoover Press : Thernstrom DP5 HPTHER0800 21-01-01 rev2 page144 144 Sally Satelof health care providers. For some preventive care (e.g., vaccinations for children and the elderly, prenatal care, routine infant checkups, and bloodpressure surveillance), physicians are not even needed. Specially trainednurses can help provide after-hours medical appointments and give basicadvice over the telephone; public health nurses or physician assistantscooperating with local churches and community organizations can deliverthese services at least as effectively. Inner-city hospitals are now hiringhealth educators (ideally from within the community) to teach fellowresidents about diet and exercise, smoking cessation, and screening forcancer, diabetes, and hypertension. These workers also participate in out-reach efforts to get people into clinics for routine care\u2014an important taskbecause medically indigent people tend to underuse available care, showup in emergency rooms for minor problems, and receive diagnoses forconditions like cancer at an advanced stage. While well-meaning groups like the AAMC advance the questionable belief that minority health is dependent on minority physicians, evidencepoints more vigorously toward the virtues of promoting health literacy, theformation of community-health organization partnerships, and the ex-pansion of health coverage to the uninsured. What patients most seem towant is a qualied doctor who will spend unhurried time with them. Theracial disparities in health are real, but data do not point convincingly tosystematic racial bias as a determinant\u2014nor to the need for racial prefer-ences in medical school admissions as a remedy for health disparities.

This breakthrough may not only improve survival after transplan-tation for black patients, but it may also obviate the need for tight antigen matchingand thus move blacks more quickly up the waiting list. In spite of the tremendouspromise of these drugs, the clinical verdict on their success will not be in for severalyears because it takes at least two years after a transplant to be certain whether a kidneywill function over the long term (Clive O.

Nationwide, minority applications dropped 13 per-cent between 1996 and 1998. In large part, though not exclusively, this was due to theCalifornia initiative and to the three states (Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi) that inthe wake of the 1996 Hopwood case no longer considered race as a factor in medicalschool admission. Even though minority applications again declined between 1998 and1999, there is no evidence that the pool of potential minority applicants is shrinking.The percentage of black and Hispanic students getting bachelor of science degrees hasremained constant, as have those races' percentage of college graduates (personalcommunication, Ella Cleveland, Division of Community and Minority Programs,January 6, 2000). No one really understands why medical school is relatively unpopularamong these students. Perhaps some are discouraged by the high educational debt theywill assume or by the loss of physician autonomy in the world of managed care.Interestingly,not all these developmentswere a result of Proposition 209 and Hopwood.First, across the country, applications from whites have been going down as well; therewas a 6 percent drop in all applicants from 1998 to 1999, the third straight year ofdecline. Second, the decline in minority applicants in California actually started twoyears before passage of Proposition 209. Third, at California's three private medical schools, which were unaffected by the new law, there was also a large drop in minorityapplications (25 percent) after its passage. 54. Michael J.
