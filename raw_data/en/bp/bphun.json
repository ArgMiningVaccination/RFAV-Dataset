By food they live. Into it also they finally enter. Therefore, food is called a medicine\" (Taittiriya. Upanishd. II.) Food is anything that sustains life. Food used as a preventative to disease and as an essential part of medicine has been established for over 4000 years by physicians of natural medicine. Food is a major determinant of health that is directly under our control. We cannot always control pollution, hereditary factors, noise, environment, and the social and emotional behaviors of others, but we can certainly choose what and what not to eat. Food is so important to human existence, and because it is utilized many times each day, it has a major affect on the body. However, most people do not realize the power of foods. We hope that you will pay attention to the principles of food medicine and incorporate this natural and powerful healing component into daily living, because anything we do three times a day will have an effect on our body! DIET AND HEALTH Their Assimilation and Function: The Chhandogya Upanishad describes the process of food and drink: Food that is eaten, gets divided into three parts. That which is its coarsest part becomes farces; that which is medium, the flesh; that which is finest, the mind. Water, which is drunk, gets divided into three parts. That which is its coarsest part becomes urine; that which is medium, the blood; that which is finest, the breath. Fire that is eaten, gets divided into three parts. That which is its coarsest part becomes bone; that which is medium, the marrow; that which is finest, the voice. The mind consists of food; the breath consists of water; the voice consists of heat. Food is like fuel to the fire or heat in the body. When food is not eaten the mind loses its strength and the fire in the body is extinguished. When water is not drunk, Prana, which is the essence of water, passes out of the body. About the mind that is influenced by the food being eaten is mentioned in another place in the Chhandogya Upanishad: \"In purity of food there is purity of mind; in purity of mind there is established memory; in established memory there results the release from all the knots of the heart.\" (VII. 26). \"If one does not eat for ten days, even though he might live, he becomes a non-seer, a non-hearer, a non- thinker, a non-doer, a non-understander. Adore food!\" (Chh. Up. VII.). This shows to what extent the mind is influenced by the food, which is eaten. A person thinks through the mental nature, which he consists of, and this nature is fed by food. Hence, the food that is eaten should always be Sattvic, for \"verily, this person consists of the essence of food\" (Taitt. Up. II. 1). About foods: Some of the essential foods are discussed below: Protective Foods These are foods, which supply both vitamins and mineral matter and so protect the body from certain diseases. The protective foods are milk, butter, cream, cheese, green vegetables eaten raw, and yellow vegetables and fruits. One pint of milk, one orange or tomato, one ounce of butter and raw salad will provide enough protective foods for a person per day. Cereals Cereals form the staple food in nearly every human diet. In India rice, wheat or millets form the bulk of the dietary. Cereals are not sources of carbohydrates. They are moderate sources of vitamins. A predominantly cereal diet should have addition of pluses. Cereals contain no vitamin C and no carotene. Whole unrefined cereals are good sources of vitamin B complex. Whereas refined cereals such as white flour and highly milled rice have lost much of their vitamin content. This is because the vitamins are concentrated in the outer layers of the whole grains, which are removed by machine milling. The only cereal, which does not suffer appreciably when machine milled, is parboiled rice. Parboiled rice is superior to other rices. Beriberi is closely associated with the habit of eating highly milled and polished rice. Dental caries is due to consumption of refined carbohydrate foods. Proteins The Allopaths think that high protein foods like meat, etc., are very useful for the body. They say, \"Such foods are very nutritious.\" They say to the patients, \"Take abundant meat. You will become strong and healthy.\" This is a sad mistake. When pulses and meat are taken in abundance they produce in the system large quantities of morbid, poisonous substances. The kidneys are overtaxed. They are not able to function properly. Inflammation of the kidneys results (Bright's disease). The patient passes much albumin in the urine. Meat is an unnatural food. It taxes the kidneys. It produces various diseases. It generates worms such as tapeworms, etc., in the bowels. It dullens the intellect and excites the passion. It is full of bad smell. People eat it under the influence of alcohol in an unconscious state. Pitiable is the lot of meat-eaters. The protein of meat can be replaced qualitatively by that of milk and cheese. If proteins are not digested and assimilated, they ferment and putrefy and generate gases and other poisonous foreign matter. A low protein diet is much better than a high protein diet. The minimum protein required is 2 ounces per day. An exclusive rice diet cannot supply the protein requirement of food. So you will have to partly replace rice by some such material (wheat or dhal) as will complement the need for complete protein. The soya bean is exceptionally rich in protein. It is the equivalent of milk protein in biological value. Coconut is a low protein food. Pulses Pulses comprise peas, beans, dhals and grams. They have a high content of protein, not however of very high biological value. They are very good for supplementing the cereal of a vegetarian diet. They are good sources of the vitamin B complex. Bengal gram (dhal chana) and to a lesser extent green gram (dhal moong) contain appreciable amounts of ascorbic acid in the dry state. Germination of Pulses: The ascorbic content of all pulses can be increased by germination. Pulses become useful, anti-scorbutic by the process of germination or sprouting. Germination causes an increase in certain components of the vitamin B complex. Sprouted pulses have been used successfully for combating scurvy for more than a century. The method is as follows.Vitamin C content is at a maximum after 30 hours of germination. Vegetables Green, leafy vegetables are generally rich sources of carotene, ascorbic acid, calcium and iron, and are relatively rich in Riboflavin. Root and other vegetables are of variable nutritive value. Most of them contain moderate amounts of ascorbic acid. The carrot is very rich in carotene. Gourd vegetables are generally of poor nutritive value, but the bitter gourd is relatively rich in ascorbic acid. The yellow pumpkin is a good source of carotene. Potato has high carbohydrate content. It is a good fuel food. It contains moderate quantities of ascorbic acid. It is an important source of starch in the diet. Tomato has a good carotene and ascorbic content. It contains iron also. Lettuce, watercress, celery, spinach and cabbage belong to the group of succulent vegetables. Potatoes, sweet potatoes, carrots belong to the group of feculent vegetables. Lettuce, spinach, cabbage, watercress, celery, Brussels sprouts and endive contain the largest quantity of organic mineral salts. Next to these come tomatoes, cucumber, radishes, asparagus, cauliflower and horse radish. Watermelons are rich in the blood purifying organic salts. A vegetables diet, partly raw and partly cooked is the best kind of diet. In order to take the fullest advantage of the vegetables, take some quantity in a raw state, because vegetables in their natural state only contain vitamin C. Lettuce, celery, cabbage and cress can be eaten without cooking. Carrots can be grated and eaten raw. Vegetables supply roughage also, the required bulk to the food, which is necessary for the proper functioning of the organs of evacuation. Lack of vegetables produces constipation. In the treatment of chronic diseases Naturopaths prescribe a strict vegetable diet. A vegetable diet eliminates from the body all morbid materials, which are accumulated in the system from a very long time. Vegetables are boiled in a large quantity of water. The water, which contains all the mineral salts, is simply thrown away. Then people eat the useless, worthless, non-substantial, dry stuff, which even a dog will not dare to smell. Nutritious conjee of rice is thrown away. Foodstuffs are refined and demineralised. This process of refining removes the essential mineral elements from your food. Such dematerialized and devitalized foods are taken to satisfy the whim and palate of the individual. The result is they develop beriberi and various other diseases. These are all criminally unwise and foolish feeding habits. Root vegetables and tubers should never be peeled, cut up and soaked in water for some time before cooking, because the soluble constituents dissolve into the water. They must be first washed; then cut up and cooked. Mineral Salts All natural foods contain mineral salts. Wrong methods of preparation and cooking often cause their loss. Mineral salts build bones and teeth. They form the red oxygen, carrying pigment of the blood. They enter into the structure of every body cell. They form a part of the digestive fluids. They keep the blood alkaline. They help the blood to coagulate. The basic value and necessity for a liberal supply of organic mineral salts in the daily food is overlooked by the Allopaths. What a sad and terrible mistake indeed! Organic mineral salts as iron, sodium, calcium, potassium, magnesium, silicon, etc., are contained in abundance in the juicy fruits and the leafy, juicy vegetables. Therefore take juicy fruits and leafy, juicy vegetables. Coconut contains more organic salts and fat. It must be taken in small quantity. It comes near to the chemical composition of human milk than any other food in existence. Plums, grapes, cherries, apricots, pears, peaches and mangoes, contain a large amount of mineral salts. They also contain large quantities of fuel sugars in easily assimilable form. The dried peas and beans, leafy green vegetables, whole grains, spinach, raisin, green peas, lettuce, tomato and cabbage contain a good quantity of iron. Nuts, cereals, dried fruits, peas and beans contain copper. The iron of foods can only be fully utilized by the body when copper is provided. Iodine is a constituent of the hormone, which is secreted by the thyroid gland, situated in front of the neck. It is needed in very small amount, but if it is lacking entirely in the diet, the thyroid glands does not function properly. Goitre is the result. Seaweed is the best source of iodine. Traces of iodine are found in cereals, leafy vegetables and milk. Oats are extremely nutritious. Barley is rich in mineral matter. It is very Sattvic. Barley bread is whole meal and beneficial. Almonds, bran, endive, figs, dry hazel-nuts, dandelion greens, lentils, molasses, mustard green, olives, spinach, turnip tops, soya been, Amaranth, fenugreek leaves, garden cress, gingerly seeds, tamarind, are rich in both calcium and iron. Milk Milk is as nearly a complete food as exists in nature. Milk should be fresh. It can be taken raw if it is drawn from a healthy animal. Milk can be taken with mango fruit with great advantage. All-important nutrients are well represented in milk, except iron, nicotinic acid and ascorbic acid. Children should have sufficient quantity of milk and butter in their diet. Milk contains the very important calcium salts, which are necessary for bone building. Butter contains vitamin D, which is necessary for the assimilation of calcium. Butter and ghee are composed of milk fat and have high vitamin A content. Vitamin A of ghee is largely destroyed when it is used as a frying medium. Curd is a very good article of diet. Whey or buttermilk (lassi) is a cooling and nutritious drink. Milk is generally the outstanding source in a diet of calcium and Riboflavin. Pasteurized milk is useless. DIFFEENT QUALITIES OF FOOD Food is of great importance to Hindus and Hinduism classifies food into certain categories, ranging from foods which can help to purify oneself to foods which cause disease and suffering. Here s a brief analysis of the different types of foods that exist: There are three types of food: Tamasic (in the mode of ignorance), Rajasic (in the mode of passion) and Sattvic (in the mode of goodness). IfThe Bhagavad Gita describes the sattvic diet as promoting life, virtue, strength, health, happiness and satisfaction. Sattvic foods are savory, smooth, firm and pleasant to the stomach. By contrast, the Gita describes the rajasic diet as excessively pungent, sour, salty, hot, harsh, astringent and burnt, leading to pain, misery and sickness. The tamasic foods are described as stale, tasteless, smelly, left-over, rotten and foul (BG 17:8-10). Sattvic Foodstuffs Sattva is defined as the quality of purity and goodness. Sattvic food is that which is pure, clean juicy, fresh, light, unctuous, nourishing, attractive in form, soft to touch and pleasant to taste, which are small in bulk but great in nourishment, sweet , tasty fatty and wholesome, and pleasing to the heart.. Sattvic foods are all vegetables and fruits, which vibrate with a steady flow of energy. Consumption of these foods gives the mental and vital a state of serenity and peace. These vibrations give mind capacity to expand and increase its subtle feelings. Sattvic foods are light in nature, easy to digest, mildly cooling, refreshing and not disturbing to the mind. They are best prepared with love and awareness. The Traditional Sattvic Diet traditionally it is described as pure foods that are rich in prana. Organic foods are therefore recommended for both their purity and vitality. Fresh Organic Fruits: Most fruits, including apples, apricots, bananas, berries, dates, grapes, melons, lemons, mangoes, oranges, peaches and plums, are considered especially sattvic. Fruit is also considered symbolic of generosity and spirituality and is often exchanged as an offering or a gift. Three dried fruits known as triphala are used to keep the digestive system operating optimally. Fresh Organic Dairy: Dairy is considered controversial these days, but tradition insists on the value of a wholesome food freely given by the symbol of motherhood, the cow. We need to use the highest quality organic fresh dairy to benefit from its sattvic qualities. Milk, butter, clarified butter (ghee), fresh home- made cheese (paneer), whey and fresh yogurt (especially lassi) are all recommended. They benefit from careful preparation, and the extra effort to learn the recipes is well worthwhile. For example, milk can be diluted and warmed with mild spices (i.e. fresh ginger, cinnamon and cardamom) and served with raw honey to overcome any mucus-forming tendencies. Traditionally, if a yogi is doing advanced practices, the dairy provides needed lubrication, grounding and nourishment. In fact, dairy along with fruit have been described as the epitome of the sattvic or yogic diet. Nuts, Seeds and Oils: Fresh nuts and seeds that haven t been overly roasted and salted are good additions to the sattvic diet in small portions. Good choices are almonds (especially when peeled and soaked in water overnight), coconut, pine nuts, walnuts, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds and flax seeds. Oils should be of highest quality and cold-pressed. Good choices are olive oil, sesame oil and flax oil. Organic Vegetables: Most mild organic vegetables are considered sattvic, including beets, carrots, celery, cucumbers, green leafy veggies, sweet potatoes and squash. Sometimes the shortcomings of these foods can be overcome by careful preparation. An excellent practice is to drink freshly made vegetable juices for their prana, live enzymes and easy absorption. Whole Grains: Whole grains provide excellent nourishment when well cooked. Consider organic rice, whole wheat, spelt, oatmeal and barley. Sometimes the grains are lightly roasted before cooking to remove some of their heavy quality. Yeasted breads are not recommended unless toasted. Wheat and other grains can be sprouted before cooking as well. Legumes: Split mung beans, yellow split peas, organic tofu, bean sprouts and perhaps lentils and aduki beans are considered sattvic if well prepared. In general, the smaller the bean, the easier to digest. Strategies include splitting, peeling, grinding, soaking, sprouting, cooking and spicing. Legumes combined with whole grains offer a complete protein combination. Sweeteners: raw honey (especially in combination with dairy) and raw sugar (not refined). Spices: Sattvic spices are the mild spices including basil, cardamom, cinnamon, coriander, cumin, fennel, fenugreek, fresh ginger and turmeric. Rajasic spices like black pepper, red pepper and garlic are normally excluded, but are sometimes used in small amounts to keep the channels open (rajas is used to counter tamas). But beware. Taking rajasic spices with tamasic food does not equal sattwa Sattvic Herbs: Other herbs are used to directly support sattva in the mind and in meditation. Pure, sattvic food needs to be chewed carefully and eaten in modest portions. Overeating is definitely tamasic. The food should be enjoyed for its inherent taste and quality, rather than the spices and seasonings that are added. Too much salt and spice has a rajasic effect, which fuels desire and leads to over-satiation, the loss of taste and the loss of pleasure. When rajas predominates, a person runs about pursuing selfish and greedy ends, driven by restlessness and desire (BG 14:12). A refined sense of taste leads to increased pleasure. Eating Satavic food increases the duration of life, purifies ones existence and gives strengtrh, health, happiness and satisfaction. It increases the energy of the mind and produces cheerfulness, serenity and mental clarity. satvic food is highly conducive to good health.A sattvic diet is food that gives courage and self- determination. In other words, sattvic food gives us more than the gross physical requirements of the proper mix of proteins, carbs and fats etc. It also gives us the subtle nourishment necessary for vitality and consciousness. Food is seen as a carrier of the life force called prana and is judged by the quality of its prana and by the effect it has on our consciousness. In the words of the Charak Samhita, one of the classic textbooks of ayurveda, The persons having the sattvic essence are endowed with memory, devotion, are grateful, learned, pure, courageous, skillful, resolute, free from anxiety, having well-directed and serious intellect and activities and are engaged in virtuous acts (CS III-8:110). Rajasic Foodstuffs rajasic foods are bitter, sour, salty, pungent, hot and dry. Puri, kachori, pungent condiments, meat, fish, eggs, sweets, fried bread, curd, brinjal (egg plant), carrots, urad (black gram), onions, garlic, lemon, masur (red gram), tea, coffee, betel leaves, tobacco are rajasic articles of food. Meat, fish, eggs, tea, coffee, cocoa, ovaltine; chillies, tamarind, chutney, pickles, asafetida, mustard, spices; highly seasoned dishes, foods that are dry and excessively hot, saline, and pungent; oil, white sugar (commercial sugar), radish, brinjals, ladies' finger, cucumber, drumstick; articles of wind-producing food, fried things pastry preparations and sesame seeds fall into the rajasic variety of food. These foods create sensuality, sexuality, greed, jealousy, anger, delusion, fantasies, egotism and irreligious feelings. The rajasic man always plans to prepare various kinds of preparations to satisfy his palate. The palate remains unsatisfied until the stomach is completely filled with pungent things and till the tongue is burnt with chillies.These foods cause distress, misery and disease. The vibration from these come in spurts and stimulate mental and vital energy for a passionate state of high activity Tamasic Foodstuffs tamasic food is stale, dry, bad smelling, distasteful or unpalatable. Foods that have been processed, canned or frozen are tamasic. Beef, fish, eggs, wine, garlic, onions and tobacco are tamasic foodstuffs.Beet, pork; all intoxicants such as ganja, bhang, charas, tobacco, all stimulants, onions, garlic, stale, rotten, unclean foodstuffs; and half-cooked and twice-cooked articles. Tamasic food can also be the sattvic food that is eaten after many hours or days of preparation, food that is tasteless, decomposed and putrid, and food consisting of remnants and untouchable things. These types of food can cause one to be dull, sleepy and greedy. It increases pessimism, ignorance, lack of common sense, greed, laziness, criminal tendencies and doubt. The tamasic man will eat, in the afternoon, food which has been cooked on the previous day and also will like the food which is half-cooked or burnt. The tamasic food s vibrations foster on unconscious state and bring about inertia. A conscious being, in whose nature these different states of existence. Properties of Food CHEMICAL PROPERTIES The chemical values of food represent the \"science of nutrition\", and these vital nutrients are water, protein, carbohydrates, fats, minerals, vitamins, enzymes, co-enzymes, fiber and trace elements. Roughly, the human body is composed of 60% water, 20% protein, 15% fat and 5% carbohydrates, vitamins, potassium, sodium, and calcium. It is certainly important to observe chemical intake of foods and make sure it is properly balanced within the body to maintain normal chemical homeostasis, or balance. These chemical values are keys to drive all functions within the body. Nutrition is very important to meet the daily chemical needs of the body for survival, however, nutrition is merely a subcategory of food. Food is not nutrition and nutrition is not food. Therefore, when one looks at the \"nutritional facts\" label on the foods being bought, this does not represent the entire classification of food, but only the chemical ingredients needed (or not needed) by the body. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES The physical values of food are taste, color, internal temperature, motion, energy, impulse, momentum, elasticity, fluid mechanics, waves, vibrating bodies, thermodynamics, acoustic phenomena, optics, electrostatics, electric currents, electrodynamics, high energy physics, and relationship with internal organs and organ systems. When the physics of foods is carefully studied, it is clear that there are many important aspects of food that have been completely disregarded, such as taste, color of food, effects to the different internal organ systems, the internal temperature and the seasonal meaning of the individual foods. BIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES The biological values of food are development, shape, size, how it grew, when it grew, age, life span, nature, category (kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species), fresh or preserved, and environmental characteristics (sunny, shady, mountain, desert, lake, sea, ocean, dry, or wet that attributed to the growth and development or withering and death). Biology is very important when describing the individual foods, because it represents the nature of the growth and development of the food being consumed. Human beings have to depend on Nature for sustenance and survival. The traditional system of medicine in India dates back to the age of the Rigveda (2500 to 1600 B.C.). Ayurveda is the Indian indigenous system of medicine dating back to the Vedic period. The term Ayurveda means Science of Life (Ayur = life, veda = knowledge). Healing Properties of Some Grain Barley - Cooling thermal nature, sweet and salty flavor, strengthens the spleen- pancreas, regulates the stomach, and fortifies the intestines. Builds the blood and yin fluids and moistens dryness, promotes diuresis, benefits the gallbladder and nerves, very easily digested. A decoction of 2 oz. pearl barley or roasted whole barley toa quart of water is traditionally used for convalescents and invalids, treats diarrhea, soothes inflamed membranes, alleviates difficult quells fever, tumors, swellings, and watery accumulations such as edema. . Barley is particularly rich in mineral matters. In this respect it is richer than wheat but its protein content I lower than that of wheat. It is a nutritive food. It is highly beneficial for the anemic and the nervous on account of its richness in iron and phosphorus. It is a Sattvic food. Spiritual aspirants take bread made out of barley. Barley has about the same nutritive value as whole wheat but it contains less gluten and so it not so easily made into bread. Barley water is useful in dysentery, typhoid, fevers, diarrhea, urinary diseases and diseases of kidneys. It has very little nutritive value. It is soothing and cooling. The value of barley water lies in its demulcent properties. It removes burning sensation in the urine and helps the free flow of urine. Pearl Barley is the whole barley. One toga of barley boiled in sixteen ounces of water makes a palatable and soothing drink. It can be mixed with lemon juice and sugar or salt to taste. You can add milk also. Boil for 10 or 15 minutes only. A tablespoonful of the powder (Robinson's Barley) also can be used for preparing barley water. Corn - Neutral thermal nature, sweet flavor, diuretic, nourishes the physical heart, influences the stomach, improves appetite, and hleps regulate digestion, promotes healthy teeth and gums, tonifies the kidneys and helps overcome sexual weakness. Drink a tea decoction made from whole dried kernels to treat kidney disease. Millet - Cooling thermal nature, sweet and salty flavor, diuretic, strengthens the kidneys, beneficial to stomach and spleen-pancreas, builds the yin fluids, moistens dryness, alkalizing, balances over-acid conditions, sweetens breath by retarding bacteria growth in mouth, high amino acid profile and rich silicon content, helps prevent miscarriage, anti-fungal, one of the best grains for those with Candida albicans overgrowth. Also useful for diarrhea, vomiting, indigestion, and diabetes. Soothes morning sickness. Oats - Warming thermal nature, sweet and slightly bitter flavor, soothing, restores nervous and reproductive systems, strengthens spleen-pancreas, builds and regulates qi energy, removes cholesterol from the digestive tract and arteries, strengthens cardiac muscles. Can be used in cases of dysentery, diabetes, hepatitis, nervous and sexual debility, indigestion and swelling including abdominal bloating. One of the richest silicon foods, oats help renew the bones and all connective tissues. oats also contain phosphurus, required for brain and nerve formulation during youth. Rice: Despite the importance of rice as a staple food, interest in its health benefits have only recently attracted attention. Laboratory studies have shown that rice products may have anti-cancer properties and the potential to treat other conditions such as diabetes, kidney stones and heart disease. The medicinal properties of rice vary depending on the types used. Many of the beneficial compounds present in brown rice are absent from the highly refined white rice. Rice bran can contain up to about 25% fibre and fibre is known to assist the absorption of fats in the gut . It also decreases levels of cholesterol in the blood. Fibre also aids digestion and can be used as a mild laxative. In Ayurveda the medicinal values of rice have been described: rice is considered to be acrid, oleaginous, tonic, aphrodisiac, fattening, diuretic and useful in biliousness Congee and its uses Traditionally known as \"hsi-fan\" or rice water, congee is eaten throughout China and even in our country as a breakfast food. It is thin porridge or gruel consisting of a handful of rice simmered in five to six times the amount of water The healing properties of this simple rice soup are that they can easily be digested and assimilated, tonifies the blood, harmonizes the digestion, and is demulcent, cooling, and nourishing. Since the chronically ill person often has weak blood and low energy, and easily develops inflammations and other heat symptoms from deficiency of yin fluids, the cooling , demulcent and tonifying properties of congee are particularly welcome. it is useful for increasing a nursing mother's supply of milk. The liquid can be strained from the porridge to drink as a supplement for infants and for serious conditions. Other therapeutic properties may be added to the congee by cooking appropriate vegetables, grains, herbs, or meats in with the rice water. Since the rice itself strengthens the spleen-pancreas digestive center, other foods added to a rice congee become more completely assimilated, and their properties are therefore enhanced. Uncommon properties of common vegetables and fruits: BITTER GOURD This is a creeper. It is cultivated in all parts of India. The leaf is an anthelmintic (kills worms in the bowels) and lactagogue (increases the milk in the nursing mothers). The juice of the leaf in which black pepper is ground is applied round the orbit of the eye to cure night-blindness or nyctolopia. The fruit is a tonic, stomachic (tonic of the stomach), stimulant, antibilious, laxative and alterative. The unripe fruit is taken us a curry in the treatment of Diabetes Mellitus (sugar in the urine). The fruit is useful in fever, cough, piles, leprosy, worms in the bowels, gonorrhea, dyspnoea, gout, rheumatism, diseases of the spleen and liver, and jaundice. It purifies the blood. A teaspoonful of the expressed juice of the fruit is useful in apthae and dysmenorrhoea or difficult menstruation. The juice of the fruit is mixed with sugar and applied as a paste in ulcers. The whole plant powdered is used as a dusting powder in leprous and other obstinate ulcers. The root is used externally as paste in hemorrhoids or piles. The seed is an anthelmintic. PAPAYA This small tree is cultivated in all parts of India. It is a useful, small, soft wooded tree, originally native of Papua new Guinea. Its green fruit is an edible vegetable and largely used in making Indian curries. Ripe fruit is sweet and delicious. Both are used in liver diseases and disorders of digestion. The fruit contains a soft, yellow resin, fat, pectin, sugar, albuminoids, citric, malic and tartaric acids, dextrin, etc. Papaya oil is found in its seeds. The leaves contain an alkaloid called carperine. The unripe fruit, milk and seeds possess emmenagogue and anthelmintic properties. The fruit is a laxative, tonic and diuretic. The papaya milk the milky fluid that comes out of scratching the surface of the raw papaya fruit contains an enzyme, which can digest starch, mucous membranes and animal proteins. Papaya milk is dried at a low temperature. Paperin, a digestive powder, is obtained. Dose 2 to 10 grains. It is very useful in dyspepsia and liver complaints. It may be rubbed in ringworm patches. It is highly beneficial in all cases when digestion is weak or when the liver is not functioning properly. The fruit should be well crushed and the seeds should be removed. Then the cold milk may be added. Sweeten this with honey or syrup dates or syrup of jaggery. This is a delicious, digestive drink. Cut the fruit into small bits and then boil in a small quantity of water. Filter the essence through a clean muslin or porus cloth. Add milk and syrup of jaggery. This is also a palatable, digestive drink. The ripe fruit is alterative. It is useful in habitual constipation, dyspepsia or indigestion, bleeding piles and chronic diarrhea. The green fruit is laxative and diuretic. It can be cooked as a curry. In women, this stimulates secretion of milk. Slices of unripe fruit can be rubbed on ringworm patches. The juice is useful in ulcers of the tongue and throat. The fresh milky juice removes round worms in children. Take one teaspoonful of fresh juice and one teaspoonful of honey. Add 2 ounces of boiling water to this. This must be followed by a dose of castor oil one ounce. Dose of the juice for adults one teaspoonful, for children half teaspoonful, and for children under three years 10 to 15 drops. The juice of the unripe fruit is useful in dysmenorrhoea. It helps the free flow of the menses. If this is applied locally in the shape of pessary to the osuteri, it causes abortion. In large doses it acts as an embolic, exciting, uterine contraction. The fresh milk juice is useful in scorpion stings as a local application. Take one teaspoonful of the milky juice of unripe fruit and add a teaspoonful of sugar. This is useful in reducing enlarged spleen. The dried ripe fruit or salted ripe fruit is useful in enlargement of spleen and liver. The leaves dipped in hot water or warmed over a fire are applied to the painful parts for nervous pains or neuralgias. Bruised leaves warmed over a fire can be applied as a poultice in boils, swellings, elephantoid growths, etc. TOMATO Tamato is more a fruit than a vegetable. It is rich in alkali minerals and vitamins A, B and C. It is the richest of all foods in vitamins. Tomato contains potassium, sodium, calcium, iron, citric and malic acids 0.5 per cent, and oxalic acid. Tomato is very rich in food minerals, which keeps the blood alkaline and thus keeps up a high power of resistance to diseases. It is rich in all the three vitamins A, B and C, which most fruits and vegetables are deficient in one or more. Tomato stimulates the sluggish liver. It is beneficial in atonic dyspepsia. It is a good diuretic, and a good nerve and brain food. Tomato juice can be given to children and infants after each feed. It acts as an anti-scorbutic against infantile scurvy. Scurvy is a disease due t deficiency of vitamin C in the diet. The symptoms are loss of energy, pallor, bleeding gums, shortness of breath, etc. The use of tomatoes in sufficient quantity will prevent and cure scurvy. Tomato has high anti-scorbutic properties. Give one spoonful of juice to begin with for a child and gradually increase the quantity to 4 or 5 teaspoonfuls daily. This supplies vitamin. Tomato is cooling. It is a tonic, too. It is rich in iron. It purifies and enriches the blood in an effective manner. It cools the body. Tomato is a potent deobstruent.

Edible oils as therapeutic agents ALL foods contain natural oils to varying degrees which provide nourishment and strength to body tissues. Ayurveda has dealt with vegetable oils under the heading of aharopyogi varga and the taila varga. Let us briefly discuss the therapeutic qualities of the few edible oils mentioned in ayurveda and also of some of those which were invented later. Sesame oil: Commonly known as tila taila , it is the most commendable of all oils. It is sweet with accompanying astringent taste, hot in potency and is endowed with properties to penetrate subtle channels of the body. Used in abundance in the panchkarma therapy, sesame oil is the best medicine to alleviate vata. It promotes general strength and skin health and is recommended to be applied in all types of cuts and wounds, insect bites, as enemata and massage oil in the diseases of the nervous system like paralysis, stiffness of the limbs and muscle weakness. Many famous classic ayurvedic oils such the sesame oil base. Mustard oil: Known as sarson oil in common parlance, mustard oil is used in almost every home in India, particularly north India. It is pungent in taste and is hot in potency. As an edible oil, it acts as the killer of intestinal worms and is best recommended for massage in conditions involving general dryness of the skin during the winters. Applied locally after mixing with a little of mushak-karpur, it serves as a magic remedy for urticaria and non- specific itching of the skin- folds. Coconut oil: Extensively used in South Indian cuisines, coconut oil has been described as an oil which is cool in effect. It is also known as a hair nourishing agent, skin tonic, body and mind energizer and endowed with many other qualities similar to that of cod liver oil. Coconut oil is applied as a household remedy for skin allergies, eczema, burns and scalds. Almond oil: Not utilised as a cooking oil, almond oil is more favoured by the exponents of the Unani system of medicine for health formulae and massage therapies. It is hot and heavy in effect and is a general health tonic. Almond oil is regarded as an aphrodisiac and eye and brain refresher and has been used since ages for the massage of the body and the scalp and also for instilling into the ear and the nose. It is laxative in effect and patients suffering from stubborn constipation get symptomatic relief if they regularly take half to one teaspoonful of almond oil daily with hot milk at bed-time. Castor oil: Also known as eranda taila , it has been traditionally used as a purgative. All ayurvedic texts have eulogised it as a panacea for acute and chronic cases of rheumatoid arthritis and there are many classic decoctions and guggul preparations where castor oil is an additive. As a household remedy for such cases, castor oil can be safely taken in a dose of 10 to 20 ml at bed-time with hot milk or used simply by adding it into the wheat flour while making the chapatti. Olive oil: Though not mentioned in ayurveda, olive oil is a cooking medium in the countries of West Asia and Europe. It has nowadays gained immense popularity throughout the world and its massage is specially recommended in emaciated and weak children. Olive oil is also a favourite of the beauticians as its regular application is believed to allay premature wrinkling and loosening of the skin. Being very hot in effect, it should be avoided by persons of pitta prakriti. Other oils: For cooking purposes many oils like those extracted from the seeds of groundnut, sunflower and cottonseed are used in India. They are nutritious, heavy and hot in effect. The rice bran oil, which was previously used in far- eastern countries, seems to be gradually entering Indian kitchens.

Human beings have to depend on Nature for sustenance and survival. The traditional system of medicine in India dates back to the age of the Rigveda (2500 to 1600 B.C.). Ayurveda is the Indian indigenous system of medicine dating back to the Vedic period. The term Ayurveda means Science of Life (Ayur = life, veda = knowledge).

Garlic ~ Lahsun It is not by opportunity that garlic is indigenous to central Asia, the area where people live the longest, and the occurrence of cancer is the lowest known. The ancient Egyptians included garlic in the diet of the slaves who built the pyramids. History attributes many properties to garlic, and most of them are proven by scientific means. Conceivably garlic is the vegetal medicine with the most scientifically established properties. The complete plant, but especially the bulb contains alliin a (a sulphured glycoside), and enzyme (alliinase), vitamins A, B1, B2, C, and niacin (a vitamin of the B group). Alliin does not smell, but by the action of alliinase, which releases and acts when garlic is crushed, it is altered first into alliicine, and then into diallyl disulphide (the genine of the glycoside), which are the most important active principles which give garlic its typical smell. Alliin and diallyl dysulphur are highly unstable substances, which melt quite easily into liquids and gases. When transported by the blood, they infuse all tissues and organs of the body. Thus they act on the whole body, though more powerfully on the organs through which they are eliminated: Bronchi and lungs, kidneys, and skin. In high doses, garlic produces a decrease in blood pressure, both highest and lowest. It has vasodilating effects, and is recommend for people suffering from hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and heart dysfunctions (angina pectoris or heart attacks). Garlic helps with anticlotting of platelets (prevents an excessive tendency of platelets to group, forming clots), and fibrinolytic (disintegrates fibrin, the protein that forms blood clots). This makes garlic highly recommended for people suffering from thrombosis, embolism, or vascular accidents due to the lack of blood flow. It decreases the level of LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol) in the blood, because it makes its absorption by the intestine more difficult. It has been proven that in the hours following a breakfast of toast with butter, the level of cholesterol increases 20%, however when the bread is rubbed with garlic, even if it has butter, this increase does not take place. Since it normalizes the level of sugar in blood, it is a must for people suffering from diabetes, and obesity. Garlic is also an antibiotic and antiseptic. It is proven to be effective against the following micro-organisms: - Escherichia coli, which causes intestinal dysbacteriosis and urinary infections. - Salmonella typhi, which causes typhoid, and other Salmonella genus that cause severe intestinal afflictions. - Shigella dysenteriae, which causes bacillus dysentery. - Staphylococcus and streptococcus, which causes furuncles (infected blemishes) and other skin infections. - Diverse types of fungi, yeasts, and some viruses, such as herpes. The active principles of garlic are supposed to interact with the nucleic acids of the virus, thus limiting its proliferation. The bacteria-killing powers of garlic inside the intestine are vigilant with bad bacteria, respecting the normal bacteria, for which it is good. This makes garlic better than most known antibiotics, since it regulates good intestinal bacteria instead of destroying it all. Its use is recommended: - In diarrhea, gastroenteritis, and colitis. - In salmonellosis (intestinal infections usually caused by spoiled food. - In intestinal bacterial imbalance (alteration of microbial balance of the intestine) often caused by the use of antibiotics. - In fermentative dyspepsia, which cause flatulence in the colon. - In urinary infections (cystitis and pyelonephritis), often caused by Esterichia coli. - In diverse bronchial affections (acute and chronic bronchitis), because when the dysulphur of allyl is liberated through the breath, it acts directly on the bronchial mucous membrane. It is also an expectorant and antiasthmatic. Garlic stimulates the activity of the defensive cells of the body, both lymphocytes and macrophages. These cells, which flow with the blood, protect us from microorganisms, and furthermore they are able to destroy cancerous cells, at least in the initial phases of tumor formation. Garlic is now used with some success as a complement in the treatment of AIDS. It is also active against ascarides and oxyuridae (little white worms that provokes anal itching in children). The most frequent types of intestinal parasites. It also prevents malignant tumors especially digestive cancers. This is likely due to its regulating action on intestinal bacteria, and normalizing action on the digestive function, though this may be related to its effects on the set of chemical reactions of the body (metabolism). Remember we only recommend it as a preventative substance. Garlic is also widely used as a corn remover. Applying a piece of garlic mashed onto a callus, covering it with a plaster (Band-Aid). Within two or three days, the corn will soften and its inflammation will reduce, thus allowing easier extirpation. Garlic has been used for thousands of years both as a culinary flavouring and for medicinal purposes. Much of the original folklore surrounding garlic has been superceded by scientific research and it is now clear that garlic does indeed have much value both as a curative and preventative treatment for many complaints. Garlic is a herb of the onion family. The garlic clove contains two sets of nutrients. Firstly, water soluable nutrients which include vitamins, enzymes, amino acids and natural sugars. Secondly, oil soluble nutrients including sulphur compounds originating from an amino acid named alliin is converted to a pungent compound called allicin which has natural antibiotic properties. Other than the pungent odor, garlic has no harmful or unpleasant side effects and can be taken indefinitely. A perennial plant which is widely cultivated as one of the most common kitchen herbs. The ancient Greeks and Romans used it as medicine. It is a native to Siberia and to S Europe where it is almost a staple food. 19. ginger Ginger is a small, perennial plant which is native to south east Asia, but is grown commercially in the Tropics. The roots are harvested after the leaves have died in autumn. Used by the Chinese for thousands of years, it is considered especially valuable for feverish and inflammatory illnesses, for hemorrhage and for blood diseases. Chinese women take it for everything from normalising menstruation to easing child birth. It is an appetite stimulant and is helpful for digestive disturbances. It is a mild stimulant to the central nervous system and is used medically in the normalizing of blood pressure. Today, ginger root is widely used as a digestive aid for mild stomach upset and is commonly recommended by professional herbalists to help prevent or treat nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, pregnancy, and, sometimes, chemotherapy for cancer (although the latter has not been studied). Motion Sickness Several studies suggest that ginger may be more effective than placebo in reducing symptoms associated with motion sickness. In one trial of 80 novice sailors (prone to motion sickness), those who took powdered ginger experienced a significant reduction in vomiting and cold sweating compared to those who took placebo. Similar results were found in a study with healthy volunteers. While these results are promising, other studies suggest that ginger is not as effective as medications in reducing symptoms associated with motion sickness. In a small study of volunteers who were given ginger (fresh root and powder form), scopolamine (a medication commonly prescribed for motion sickness), or placebo, those receiving the medication experienced significantly fewer symptoms compared to those who received ginger. Given the safety of ginger, however, many people find it a welcome alternative to medications if it relieves their motion sickness. Pregnancy Related Nausea and Vomiting At least two studies have found that ginger is more effective than placebo in relieving nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy. In a small study including 30 pregnant women with severe vomiting, those who ingested 1 gram of ginger every day for four days reported more relief from vomiting than those who received placebo. In a larger study including 70 pregnant women with nausea and vomiting, those who received a similar dosage of ginger felt less nauseous and experienced fewer vomiting episodes than those who received placebo. Nausea and vomiting following surgery Research has produced mixed results regarding the use of ginger in the treatment of nausea and vomiting following surgery. In two studies, 1 gram of ginger root before surgery reduced nausea as effectively as a leading medication. In one of these two studies, women who received ginger also required fewer nausea-relieving medications following surgery. Other studies, however, have failed to find the same positive effects. In fact, one study found that ginger may actually increase vomiting following surgery. For this reason, further studies are needed to determine whether ginger is safe and effective for the prevention and treatment of nausea and vomiting following surgery. Inflammation In addition to providing relief from nausea and vomiting, ginger extract has long been used in traditional medical practices to decrease inflammation. In fact, many herbalists today use ginger to help treat health problems associated with inflammation, such as arthritis, bronchitis, and ulcerative colitis. In a recent study of 261 people with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee, those who received a ginger extract twice daily experienced less pain and required fewer pain-killing medications compared to those who received placebo. Although there have also been a few other studies of the benefit of ginger for arthritis, one recent trial found that the herb was no more effective than ibuprofen (a medication frequently used to treat OA) or placebo in reducing symptoms of OA. Other Although it is much too early to tell if this will benefit those with heart disease, a few preliminary studies suggest that ginger may lower cholesterol and prevent the blood from clotting. Each of these effects may protect the blood vessels from blockage and the damaging effects of blockage such as atherosclerosis, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Again, however, it is too early too know if these initial study results will ultimately prove helpful for people. 20. Nutmeg Powder ~ Jaiphal Has a warm and pleasing flavor. Used to flavor curries, kormas, rice dishes, and Indian desserts. Also, used as a remedy for digestive disorders. Medicinal Properties: Colicky pain and diarrhoea: Take 1/8 tsp finely ground nutmeg along with 1 tsp jaggery and 1 tsp ghee.

Diarrhoea: Add a pinch of nutmeg powder and 1/4 tsp ginger paste to 1 glass buttermilk and drink. Dysentry: Take a pinch of nutmeg powdered nutmeg with a cup of hot milk. Eczema,Ringworm: Rub a nutmeg against a smooth stone slab with a little water and make a paste.Apply on the affected parts. Pimples: Grind equal quantities of nutmeg,black pepper and sandalwood and apply frequently. 21. Tamarind ~ Imli Tart and unique sour taste. Used in chutney, sambhar and chats to give a sour flavor to foods, somewhat like lemons and limes. Medicinal Properties: Blood Clot/Swelling due to injuries:After removing the seeds and fibre,mix the pulp(3 tbsp) with 1 tsp salt and 1/2 cup water.Mix thoroughly and heat the mixture in a container.When bearably hot,apply on the affected areas.Wash with water the next day and repeat for 3 days. Indigestion,loss of appetite,tastelessness: or plain,steamed rice. Fevers: Make an infusion of 1 tsp fruit pulp in 1 cup water and drink. Sore throat: Dilute the pulp with warm water and gargle. 22. Turmeric(haldi): Medicinal Uses and Indications While turmeric has a long history of use by herbalists, most studies to date have been conducted in the laboratory or in animals and it is not clear that these results apply to people. Nevertheless, research suggests that turmeric may be helpful for the following conditions. Digestive Disorders (stomach upset, gas, abdominal cramps): The German Commission E (an authoritative body that determined which herbs could be safely prescribed in that country and for which purpose[s]) approved turmeric for a variety of digestive disorders. Curcumin, for example, one of the active ingredients in turmeric, induces the flow of bile, which helps break down fats. In an animal study, extracts of turmeric root reduced secretion of acid from the stomach and protected against injuries such as inflammation along the stomach (gastritis) or intestinal walls and ulcers from certain medications, stress, or alcohol. Further studies are needed to know to what extent these protective effects apply to people as well. Osteoarthritis Because of its ability to reduce inflammation, turmeric may help relieve the symptoms of osteoarthritis. A study of people using an Ayurvedic formula of herbs and minerals containing turmeric as well as Withinia somnifera (winter cherry), Boswellia serrata (Boswellia), and zinc significantly reduced pain and disability. While encouraging for the value of this Ayurvedic combination therapy to help with osteoarthritis, it is difficult to know how much of this success is from turmeric alone, one of the other individual herbs, or the combination of herbs working in tandem. Atherosclerosis Early studies suggest that turmeric may prove helpful in preventing the build up of atherosclerosis (blockage of arteries that can eventually cause a heart attack or stroke) in one of two ways. First, in animal studies an extract of turmeric lowered cholesterol levels and inhibited the oxidation of LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol. Oxidized LDL deposits in the walls of blood vessels and contributes to the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Turmeric may also prevent platelet build up along the walls of an injured blood vessel. Platelets collecting at the site of a damaged blood vessel cause blood clots to form and blockage of the artery as well. Studies of the use of turmeric to prevent or treat heart disease in people would be interesting in terms of determining if these mechanisms discovered in animals apply to people at risk for this condition. Cancer There has been a substantial amount of research on turmeric's anti-cancer potential. Evidence from laboratory and animal studies suggests that curcumin has potential in the treatment of various forms of cancer, including prostate, breast, skin, and colon. Human studies will be necessary before it is known to what extent these results may apply to people. Roundworms and Intestinal worms Laboratory studies suggest that curcuminoids, the active components of turmeric, may reduce the destructive activity of parasites or roundworms. Liver Disease Animal studies provide evidence that turmeric can protect the liver from a number of damaging substances such as carbon tetrachloride and acetominophen (also called paracetamol, this medication, used commonly for headache and pain, can cause liver damage if taken in large quantities or in someone who drinks alcohol regularly.) Turmeric accomplishes this, in part, by helping to clear such toxins from the body and by protecting the liver from damage. Bacterial Infection Turmeric's volatile oil functions as an external antibiotic, preventing bacterial infection in wounds. Wounds In animal studies, turmeric applied to wounds hastens the healing process. Mosquito Repellent A mixture of the volatile oils of turmeric, citronella, and hairy basil, with the addition of vanillin (an extract of vanilla bean that is generally used for flavoring or perfumes), may be an alternative to D.E.E.T., one of the most common chemical repellents commercially available. Eye Disorder One study of 32 people with uveitis (inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of the eye between the sclera [white outer coat of the eye] and the retina [the back of the eye]) suggests that curcumin may prove to be as effective as corticosteroids, the type of medication generally prescribed for this eye disorder. The uvea contains many of the blood vessels that nourish the eye. Inflammation of this area, therefore, can affect the cornea, the retina, the sclera, and other important parts of the eye. More research is needed to best understand whether curcumin may help treat this eye inflammation. Honey This is a very valuable food. It is a natural laxative. It is one of the best forms of sugar available. It supplies lot of energy. It is a substitute for glucose. Ayurvedic as well as Yunani medicine have been using honey as a vital medicine for centuries. Scientists of today also accept honey as a \"Ram Ban\" (very effective) medicine for all kinds of diseases. Honey can be used without any side effects for any kind of diseases. Cosmetic Properties A face pack can be made by mixing honey with half a cup of bran to form a smooth paste. Add rosewater to mix if necessary. Remove with warm water and apply a good astringent. Use twice a week to keep the skin soft, supple and free from scaling. Many hand and body lotions, facial creams, soaps contain honey. It will penetrate tiny crevices through which even water will not pass. It therefore makes an excellent protective, germ-proof shield. Healing Properties When honey is applied to burns, it will prevent the formation of blisters and promote quick healing of the skin. Honey can absorb moisture and it has been prized for its mild antibiotic properties for centuries due to this fact. Where bacteria is trapped in honey, the honey will absorb moisture from the bacteria and so kill it off. It is found that mixture of Honey and Cinnamon cures most of the diseases. Today's science says that even though honey is sweet, if taken in the right dosage as a medicine, it does not harm diabetic patients. Weekly World News, a magazine in Canada, on its issue dated 17 January, 95 has given the following list of diseases that can be cured by Honey and Cinnamon as researched by western scientists. HEART DISEASES: Make a paste of honey and cinnamon powder, apply on bread, chappati, or other bread, instead of jelly and jam and eat it regularly for breakfast. It reduces the cholesterol in the arteries and saves the patient from heart attack. Also those who already had an attack, if they do this process daily, they are kept miles away from the next attack. Regular use of the above process relieves loss of breath and strengthens the heartbeat. In America and Canada, various nursing homes have treated patients successfully and have found that as age the arteries and veins lose their flexibility and get clogged; honey and cinnamon revitalizes the arteries and veins. ARTHRITIS: Take one part honey to two parts of lukewarm water and add a small teaspoon of cinnamon powder, make a paste and massage it on the itching part of the body slowly. It is noticed that the pain recedes within a minute or two. Arthritis patients may take daily, morning and night, one cup of hot water with two spoons of honey and one small teaspoon of cinnamon powder. If taken regularly even chronic arthritis can be cured. In a recent research conducted at the Copenhagen University, it was found that when the doctors treated their patients with a mixture of one tablespoon Honey and half teaspoon cinnamon powder before breakfast, they found that within a week out of the 200 people so treated practically 73 patients were totally relieved of pain and within a month, mostly all the patients who could not walk or move around because of arthritis started walking without pain. HAIR LOSS: Those suffering from hair loss or baldness, may apply a paste of hot olive oil, one tablespoon of honey, one teaspoon of cinnamon powder before bath and keep it for approx. 15 min. and then wash the hair. It was found to be effective even if kept on for 5 minutes. BLADDER INFECTIONS: Take two tablespoons of cinnamon powder and one teaspoon of honey in a glass of lukewarm water and drink it. It destroys the germs in the bladder. TOOTHACHE: Make a paste of one teaspoon of cinnamon powder and five teaspoons of honey and apply on the aching tooth. This may be applied 3 times a day till the tooth stops aching. CHOLESTEROL: Two tablespoons of honey and three teaspoons of Cinnamon Powder mixed in 16 ounces of tea water, given to a cholesterol patient, was found to reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood by 10% within 2 hours. As mentioned for arthritic patients, if taken 3 times a day, any chronic cholesterol is cured. As per information received in the said journal, pure honey taken with food daily relieves complains of cholesterol. COLDS: Those suffering from common or severe colds should take one tablespoon lukewarm honey with 1/4 spoon cinnamon powder daily for 3 days. This process will cure most chronic cough, cold and clear the sinuses. INFERTILITY: Yunani and Ayurvedic Medicine have been using honey for thousands of years to strengthen the semen of men. If impotent men regularly take two tablespoon of honey before going to sleep, their problem will be solved. In China, Japan and Far-East countries, women, who do not conceive and need to strengthen the uterus, have been taking cinnamon powder for centuries. Women who cannot conceive may take a pinch of cinnamon powder in half teaspoon of honey and apply it on the gums frequently throughout the day, so that it slowly mixes with the saliva and enters the body. A couple in Maryland, USA, had no children for 14 years and had lost hope of having a child of their own. When told about this process husband and wife started taking honey and cinnamon as stated above, the wife conceived after a few months and had twins at full term. UPSET STOMACH: Honey taken with cinnamon powder cures stomachache and also clears stomach ulcers from the root. GAS: According to the studies done in India & Japan, it is revealed that if honey is taken with cinnamon powder the stomach is relieved of gas. IMMUNE SYSTEM: Daily use of honey and cinnamon powder strengthens the immune system and protects the body from bacteria and viral attacks. Scientists have found that honey has various vitamins and iron in large amounts. Constant use of honey strengthens the white blood corpuscles to fight bacteria and viral diseases. INDIGESTION: Cinnamon powder sprinkled on two tablespoons of honey taken before food, relieves acidity and digests the heaviest of meals. INFLUENZA: A scientist in Spain has proved that honey contains a natural ingredient, which kills the influenza germs and saves the patient from flu. LONGEVITY: Tea made with honey and cinnamon powder, when taken regularly arrests the ravages of old age. Take 4 spoons of honey, 1 spoon of cinnamon powder and 3 cups of water and boil to make like tea. Drink 1/4cup, 3 to 4 times a day. It keeps the skin fresh and soft and arrests old age. Life spans also increases and even a 100 years old, starts performing the chores of a 20-year-old. PIMPLES: Three tablespoons of Honey and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder paste. Apply this paste on the pimples before sleeping and wash it next morning with warm water. If done daily for two weeks, it removes pimples from the root. SKIN INFECTIONS: Applying honey and cinnamon powder in equal parts on the affected parts cures eczema, ringworm and all types of skin infections. WEIGHT LOSS: Daily in the morning 1/2hour before breakfast on an empty stomach and at night before sleeping, drink honey and cinnamon powder boiled in one-cup water. If taken regularly it reduces the weight of even the most obese person. Also drinking of this mixture regularly does not allow the fat to accumulate in the body even though the person may eat a high calorie diet. CANCER: Recent research in Japan and Australia has reveled that advanced cancer of the stomach and bones have been cured successfully. Patients suffering from these kinds of cancer should daily take one tablespoon of honey with one teaspoon of cinnamon powder for one month 3 times a day. FATIGUE: Recent studies have shown that the sugar content of honey is more helpful rather than being detrimental to the strength of the body. Senior citizens, who take honey and cinnamon power in equal parts, are more alert and flexible. Dr. Milton who has done research says that half tablespoon honey taken in a glass of water and sprinkled with cinnamon powder, taken daily after brushing and in the afternoon at about 3.00 p.m. when the vitality of the body starts to decrease, increases the vitality of the body within a week. BAD BREATH: People of South America, first thing in the morning gargle with one teaspoon of honey and cinnamon powder mixed in hot water. So their breath stays fresh throughout the day. HEARING LOSS: Daily morning and night honey and cinnamon powder taken in equal parts restore hearing. Water is also medicinal ! Up to seventy percent of the total body weight is due to water. Although it is present in all parts of the body, it is more in organs such as lungs and brain and fluids such as blood, lymph, saliva and secretions by the organs of the digestive system. Most people believe that we feel thirsty whenever our body needs more water. While this is true, recent research studies have indicated that there are several other indicators of inadequate water in some or all parts of the body. Ignoring these indicators can lead to several major diseases that medicines may cure but not treat. Whenever there is water shortage in the house, one would prioritize the use of water for essential purposes. Similarly, when the body receives less water histamine, a chemical compound present in all cells, initiates a system of water regulation. Histamine directs some neurotransmitters to operate sub-systems to regulate water intake. These sub-systems use chemical substances such as \"vasopressin\" and renin-angiotensin\" for regulating water intake and distribution. The ratio of the water content in and outside the cells of the various organs is very important. As age advances, water content in the cells decreases. Since the water content in each cell plays a vital role in maintaining is normal function, inadequate water can lead to loss of some functions. Loss "}
