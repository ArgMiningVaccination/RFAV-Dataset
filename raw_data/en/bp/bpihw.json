Bone health is no exception. We all know calcium and vitamin D are important, but did you know that there are other key nutrients required for bone health missing from our diets? Just think of the handy acronym CBS: collagen (calcium, too!), boron, and silica. Call that a stretch? Maybe so, but what's not far-fetched are the incredible bene ts these synergistic nutrients provide! By Liz Mueller Calling All Collagen Revered as a beauty booster for healthy skin, type I collagen is a major structural protein, accounting for 25% of total body protein and is most commonly found in the skin, connective tissues, and you guessed it, the bones. In animal studies, intake of hydrolyzed collagen (HC) peptides has been shown to improve bone mineral density and bone mineral content, and to increase the quantity of type I collagen in the bone matrix. In a study of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, oral intake of collagen hydrolysate taken in conjunction with calcitonin (a naturally occurring hormone that regulates calcium levels and is involved in bone building) led to a signi cant decline in bone collagen breakdown compared to those taking calcitonin alone. \"These results suggest that dietary collagen peptides would effectively prevent age-related bone loss,\" researchers concluded.MAKE NO BONES ABOUT IT\u2014 COLLAGEN, BORON & SILICA ARE UNBEATABLE FOR BONE HEALTH! Did you know... osteoporosis and low bone mass currently affect more than 52 million US women and men aged 50 and older? If trends continue, that gure is expected to climb to more than 61 million by the year 2020. That's approximately 55 percent\u2014a one in two chance of having osteoporosis or low bone mass. It's also estimated that worldwide, an astounding 1 in 3 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 will experience osteoporotic fractures. SILICA STRONG As the second most abundant element in the Earth's crust, silicon is involved in the earliest stages of collagen production and bone formation. In fact, it's impossible to form bone without calcium and silicon! Silica\u2014the bioactive form of silicon\u2014is associated with bone strengthening by enhancing calcium absorption, and strengthening collagen protein by creating and maintaining collagen. This leads to greater fl exibility in the bones, helps form new bone, and strengthens mature bone. Recently, two studies have reported that dietary silicon intake is associated with higher bone mineral density. With collagen, boron, and silica, there are no bones about it... you're giving yourself a leg up on bone health! WITH What boron does for bone health cannot be underestimated. This naturally occurring trace mineral plays an active role in preventing calcium loss and bone demineralization and increases calcium absorption in peri-and postmenopausal women. Dietary boron infl uences the metabolism of several micronutrients essential for bone health, including calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D. In college age females, boron supplementation was shown to be related to an increase in bone mineral density. It's also associated with preventing osteoporosis, treating conditions like arthritis, and increasing bone strength.

GABA and L-theanine. GABA (gamma aminobutyric acid) functions as a calming neurotransmitter, and L-theanine (found in high-quality green tea) has neurotransmitter-like effects. GABA helps the brain lter out extraneous information, which helps reduce stress. New research has found that GABA can also improve sleep length and quality. L-theanine boosts the brain's alpha wave activity, which is associated with less anxiety and more of a relaxed feeling. In a study of college students taking exams, L-theanine supplements signi cantly reduced feelings of stress. Take: 200-500 mg of GABA or 100-200 mg of L-theanine daily. Both supplements can be combined, but reduce the dosages. B-complex vitamins. Key research in the 1940s established the B vitamins as anti-stress and anti-anxiety nutrients. They work in part by boosting levels of serotonin, a calming neurotransmitter. More recent research found that a daily high-potency B-complex supplement can signi cantly reduce feelings of work-related stress and improve feelings of depression, dejection, and anger. A multivitamin (which will contain the B complex) or the combination of a B-complex and vitamin C, along with magnesium, can also reduce stress and improve mood. Take: A high-potency B-complex or multivitamin with 25-50 mg of vitamins B1, B2, and B3. Add vitamin C and magnesium for a stress-busting boost! Phosphatidylserine (PS) . This phospholipid is concentrated in the brain, where it maintains the structural integrity and plasticity of neurons. PS also modulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA), the system of feedback between the central nervous system and endocrine system that triggers the stress response and release of the stress hormone cortisol. Clinical research has found that PS supplements reduce the cortisol response to both mental and physical stress and can actually improve mood. Take: 200-400 mg of phosphatidylserine daily. NATURAL MOOD ENHANCERS: THE WAY UP FROM DEPRESSION Mood problems can be related to stress and poor eating habits. Whatever the cause, several nutrients can enhance the biochemical processes that underlie normal brain function . Omega-3 sh oil. The omega-3 fats shine as a natural means of resolving depression. Articles published in the American Journal of Psychiatry have described how the omega-3s help people with depression, postpartum depression, and bipolar disorder. In fact, a study in Nutritional Neuroscience found that high-dose MILLENNIAL ALERT: By Jack Challem, The Nutrition ReporterSTRESS-BUSTING, MOOD-ENHANCING SUPPLEMENTS If you're a millennial, born sometime between the early 1980s and 2000, you've probably had your share of stresses and mood- battering life experiences, and mostly likely continue to wrestle with them. \"Millennials stress about everything other groups stress about, except with a layer of self-enforced perfectionism on top of everything,\" says Brit McGinnis, a Portland, Oregon, author and advertising copywriter\u2014and a 20-something millennial. \"Jobs are scarce, and an advancement-based, living-wage career is nigh impossible to nd. Yet we are still expected to earn more and more money, appear to have it together, and not admit struggles.\" Millennial or not, there's nothing better than eating healthy foods\u2014 quality proteins and lots of veggies\u2014and engaging in physical exercise to manage stress and maintain an upbeat mood. Minimize your intake of sugary and starchy foods, e.g., sweets, breads, pastas, which can cause blood sugar swings and subsequent mood swings. It's important, also, to not over-caffeinate. Excess caffeine revs up anxiety, the stress response, and sleep disorders. Finally, add any number of relaxation strategies to the mix, such as meditation, yoga, and walking in nature\u2014what the Japanese call shinrin-yoku. Though you might resist the idea, it's also important to disconnect from all things electronic, other than soothing music, for blocks of time during the day. As essential as they've become, iPhones and other types of smart phones have fostered new forms of obsessive-compulsive behavior over the past 10 years or so. The user interface of phones encourages game-like interactivity that can become addictive and obsessive. Under those circumstances, not being able to use a phone feels a bit like drug withdrawal. Given today's nonstop 24/7 world, many people need a little extra nutritional help; nutrients form the building blocks of the brain's complex biochemicals, and supplements can boost their reserves. That's especially important when so much in life aims to throw us off balance.12 omega-3s led to signi cant improvements in adolescents with major depression, the most severe type. A brand new study by Japanese researchers found that high levels of omega-3s were associated with a 36 to 45 percent lower risk of depression. Take : 2 to 5 grams of omega-3s daily. B-complex vitamins. These vitamins can also help with depression. Some of the Bs, such as vitamin B6, are required for the production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that protects against depression. A recent study found that a combination of vitamins B6 and B12 and folate, combined with medication, was better than just drug treatment and resulted in an \"enhanced and sustained antidepressant response.\" Take: A high-potency B-complex or multivitamin with 25-50 B1, and B3. L-Tryptophan and 5-HTP. L-tryptophan and its 5-HTP form (5-hydroxytryptophan) serve as the direct precursors to serotonin. L-tryptophan has numerous functions in the body, whereas 5-HTP can be converted only to serotonin. L-tryptophan can lead to improvements in depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Because some serotonin gets converted to melatonin, L-tryptophan and 5-HTP can also help with sleep. Take: 500 mg of L-tryptophan three times daily, or 50 mg of 5-HTP three times daily. Take the third dose before bed, at least one hour away from any food. St. John's wort. For mild to moderate depression, this herb works as well as, if not better than, the most commonly prescribed anti- depressant drugs\u2014and it causes fewer side effects. An analysis of 29 studies, involving almost 5,500 patients, found that St. John's wort worked just as well as drugs in the treatment of the most serious type of depression. Be aware that St. John's wort increases liver detoxi cation and can hasten the breakdown of drugs, including oral contraceptives and chemotherapeutic drugs. Take: 300 mg of a standardized product three times daily for mild to moderate depression. Double this amount for major depression. Curcumin. This anti-infl ammatory plant extract can relieve symptoms of depression. Australian researchers found that 500 mg of the BCM- 95 form (a trademarked form) of curcumin helped people with major depression. Even greater bene ts were seen in patients with \"atypical depression,\" characterized by weight gain, excessive sleep, extreme fatigue, and being especially sensitive to rejection. WAYS TO CALM ANXIETY Anxiety often coexists with depression, and some of the nutrients that help in depression are also of bene t in anxiety. Anxiety can include feelings of nervousness or build to panic attacks. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) usually includes both depression and anxiety. Vitamin C. The brain contains the highest concentration of vitamin C of any organ in the body. The rst symptoms of inadequate vitamin C intake are irritability and fatigue, which are both associated with anxiety. A recent study found that vitamin C supplements reduced feelings of anxiety. Vitamin C also protects the brain against toxins Take: 1,000 to 3,000 mg daily, preferably in divided doses. B-complex vitamins. A recent study at the University of Miami found that taking a B-complex supplement daily for 60 days reduced both anxiety and depression. The B vitamins are cofactors for the brain's production of mood-stabilizing neurotransmitters. Take: A high- potency B-complex supplement in the morning with food. Magnesium. This mineral plays roles in a multitude of chemical reactions in the body, plus it has a calming effect. Stress can deplete magnesium levels, leaving people more susceptible to anxiety. The mineral is especially bene cial in combination with the B-complex vitamins and vitamin C. Take: 200 mg once or twice daily. Larger amounts taken at one time can have a laxative effect. Probiotics. There really is a gut-brain connection\u2014our gut bacteria make 95 percent of the body's serotonin, along with appreciable amounts of GABA and other neurotransmitters. Recent studies found that probiotic supplements can reduce feelings of stress and anxiety, and negative thoughts. Look for a multi-strain formula and follow label directions for use. Whether you're a millennial, a baby boomer, or a member of another generation, eating sensibly, employing relaxation strategies, and taking certain supplements can go a long way toward buffering the stresses of life and maintaining healthy moods. Omega-3 sh oil. There's growing research showing that the omega- 3s can be helpful in easing anxiety and, particularly, PTSD. In this respect, docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) appears to have more bene ts than eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). One study found that high DHA levels were also associated with less anxiety early in pregnancy. Take: 2 to 5 grams of the omega-3s daily.

By current estimates, the rates of Alzheimer's disease will triple from 5.2 million to a projected 13.8 million by 2050. Millennials, this is your generation. While there is no \"one-size- ts-all\" solution to prevent mental decline, there are a number of things you can do now to protect your brain from infl ammation and oxidative damage\u2014two underlying factors in Alzheimer's disease and general mental decline. One of the ways you can do this is with cranberries. Cranberries are incredibly rich in these terpenes, ursolic acid, was recently found to protect brain cells from excitotoxicity\u2014overactivity of excitatory brain cells receptors, which can damage brain cells and lead to cell death\u2014by signi cantly reducing oxidative damage to mitochondria. Excitotoxicity is suspected to be involved in both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. Cranberries are one of only a few food sources of ursolic acid. Other research has found that the fl avonols and anthocyanins in cranberries reduced neuronal cell death caused by oxidative damage by nearly 50 percent, compared to the control. Compounds in cranberries have also been found to exert a strong anti-infl ammatory effect.By Lindsay Wilson HEADQUARTERSSMORGANICMONTH 100% ORGANIC PRODUCE FREE CLASSES*: Fall in Love with Organics!

In a new study, researchers have found that people eating a Mediterranean-style diet had longer telomeres, suggesting that they have a lower risk of disease and death. Immaculata De Vivo, PhD, MPH, of the Harvard Medical School, and her colleagues studied 4,676 women who have been part of the ongoing Nurses' Health Study. The women had blood drawn, which was used to measure telomere length in white blood cells, a marker of biological aging. They also completed dietary questionnaires, and their adherence to a Mediterranean diet was given a score of 0 to 9, with higher numbers indicating greater consistency in following the diet. Women who more closely followed the Mediterranean diet had longer telomeres, compared with those who did not follow the diet. Each single point change in adherence to the Mediterranean diet correlated with 1.5 years of telomere aging. In other words, a two-point difference would correspond to a three-year difference in either faster or slower aging, and a nine-point difference would correspond to a 13.5 year difference in faster or slower aging. Signi cantly, only the entire diet appeared to infl uence telomere length, not any individual dietary component. The Mediterranean diet consists of a large intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, unre ned grains, sh, and olive oil. It also includes a moderate intake of wine and a low intake of dairy products and saturated fat. Reference: Crous-Bou M, Fung TT, Prescott J, et al.

The twitches began in an eye and then progressed to his lips and legs. He also suffered from fatigue and gastrointestinal distress. The patient had previously been diagnosed with wheat allergy at age 24, but did not adopt a wheat-free diet. IgG allergy testing found him sensitive to multiple grains, dairy products, and other foods. Within six months of successfully complying with dietary restrictions, the patient's muscle twitching ceased. His other health issues, including gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and brain fog also improved. Anderson B. Journal of Chiropractic Medicine, 2014; 13:188-191. Cat's claw extract helps cancer patients Doctors in Brazil treated 51 male and female terminal cancer patients (with life expectancies of at least two months). All of the patients had solid tumors. They were asked to take 100 mg of the herb cat's claw (Uncaria tomentosa) three times daily. By the end of the study, the cat's claw supplements improved the patients' overall quality of life and social function and reduced their fatigue. The herb did not reduce tumor sizes, but the disease stabilized in four patients for more than eight months. de Paula LC. Journal of Alternative & Complementary Medicine, 2015;21:22-30.

A study of 291 Chinese women found that women with relatively high blood levels of DDT were far less likely to become pregnant. However, high blood levels of vitamin B12 and folate appeared to protect against the effects of DDT and improved their chances of becoming pregnant. Ouyang F. American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2014; 100;1470-1478. Curcumin, an extract of turmeric root, is a potent antioxidant and anti-infl ammatory substance. Previous research found that it can help ease depression. In new research, scientists have found that curcumin supplements can have broad cognitive and mood bene ts in healthy people. Andrew B. Scholey, PhD, and Katherine HM Cox, BSc, of the Swinburne University of Technology in Australia, asked 60 healthy older adults, ages 60 to 85 years, to take (1) a single dose of 400 mg of curcumin, (2) 400 mg daily for four weeks, or (3) placebos. Scholey and Cox administered cognitive and mood tests one and three hours after subjects took a single dose of 400 mg curcumin, after they took curcumin daily for four weeks, and one and three hours after taking a single dose after having consumed curcumin supplements for the previous four weeks. They found that one hour after taking curcumin, the subjects \"signi cantly improved\" sustained attention and short-term memory. In addition, weeks of curcumin supplementation improved the subjects' \"working memory,\" which refers to short-term memory needed for learning, storing, and managing information. Furthermore, long-term consumption of curcumin led to less fatigue and greater feelings of being calm and content. Reference: Cox KHM, Scholey AB.

In a new study, Danish researchers reported that high doses of resveratrol appear to improve bone density. Marie Juul Ornstrup, MD, PhD, and her colleagues at Aarhus University Hospital tested the effects of two doses of resveratrol and placebos on 66 obese men with metabolic syndrome. Some of the men took 1,000 mg of resveratrol while others took only 150 mg. Men taking the higher dose of resveratrol bene ted from signi cant increases in bone alkaline phosphatase and bone mineral density. Bone alkaline phosphatase is involved in mineralization. Ornstrup wrote that the resveratrol supplements \"positively affects bone, by stimulating formation of mineralization.\" Reference: Ornstrup MJ, Harslof T, Nordstrom T, et al. Resversatol increases bone mineral density and bone alkaline phosphatase in obese men: a randomized Endocrinology and Metabolism, 2014; 99:4720-9.The omega-3 fats are essential for fetal and infant brain development, and studies have shown that they can infl uence mood throughout life. In a new study, researchers have found that omega-3 supplements can reduce aggressive behavior in children. Adrian Raine, PhD, of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and his colleagues treated 100 children who ranged from eight to 16 years of age. Each day for six months, some of the children received a daily drink containing 300 mg of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and 200 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), while others received a drink without omega-3s. At the end of the study, the children receiving omega-3s had signi cant improvements in aggressive and antisocial behavior, as well as in internalized behavior issues, such as depression. Collectively, parents reported a 42 percent improvement in antisocial behavior and a 69 percent reduction in depression and other internalized mood issues. Furthermore, the parents' behavior improved even though they weren't taking omega-3s. \"Parents whose children took omega-3 showed signi cant post-treatment reductions in their own antisocial and aggressive behavior,\" wrote Raine. The likely reason was that the parents were less stressed by their children. Reference: Raine A, Portnoy J, Liu J, et al. Reduction in behavior problems with omega-3 supplementation in children strati ed, parallel-group of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, 2014: doi 10.1111/jcpp.12314. COMPOUND FOUND IN BROCCOLI IMPROVES BEHAVIOR IN AUTISM STUDYOMEGA-3 s REDUCE BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS IN CHILDREN Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) affects one of every 68 children, mostly males, in the United States. The developmental disorder interferes with communication and social interactions and includes repetitive behavior patterns. Some nutritional therapies, such as vitamin B6 and magnesium, have led to moderate bene ts. In the latest study along these lines, researchers found that sulforaphane, a compound found in broccoli, can lead to signi cant improvements in the behavior of children with ASD. Andrew W. Zimmerman, MD, of the Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues tested the effects of sulforaphane on 29 young men, ages 13-27, and compared their responses to 15 comparable subjects who were given placebos during an 18-week study. The sulforaphane dosages varied according to the subjects' weight. Those weighing less than 100 pounds received 9 mg of sulforaphane daily, those weighing 100-199 pounds got 18 mg daily, and those heavier than 200 pounds received 27 mg daily.All of the subjects were assessed by parents, caregivers, or physicians using three standardized tests: the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), and Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale (CGI-I). At weeks four, 10, and 18, the subjects taking sulforaphane had signi cant improvements in hyperactivity, irritability, lethargy, and repetitive movements, according to the ABC test. They also had improvements in awareness, communication, and motivation, according to the SRS scale. By the end of the 18-week study, the CGI-I test showed notable improvements in social interaction in 46 percent of those taking sulforaphane (compared with none in the placebo group), as well as improvements in verbal communication in 42 percent of those taking sulforaphane (compared with none in the placebo group). In addition, behavior improved in 54 percent, or 14 individuals, of those taking sulforaphane (compared with only 9 percent, or one, of those getting placebos).

But what exactly is the immune system, and what does it mean to boost immunity? What Is The Immune System? Your immune system is responsible for ghting foreign invaders, including pathogenic bacteria and viruses, and for destroying internal threats such as abnormal cells. Your ability to interact with the world around you and remain healthy is largely dependent on the healthy functioning of the immune system. You can think of your immune system as a finely tuned orchestra\u2014like an orchestra, the immune system contains a host of different instruments that work together with one harmonious goal: to protect you from foreign invaders that can cause damage to your body. The players of this orchestra include immune cells; physical barriers such as the mucous membranes of the respiratory system and the gut; and the messenger molecules that either activate immune cells to action or tell them to stop. But just like an orchestra, when one player falls out of tune, so does the whole orchestra. Supporting your immune system (or \"boosting immunity\") means supporting all the sections in the orchestra, and one way you can do this is with food! What you feed your body plays a key role in how well your immune system functions\u2014poor nutrition has been shown to result in increased infections and slow healing from infections and injury, while certain foods give your immune system a boost by providing it with the nutrients it needs to function at its best. Seven Foods That Support Your Immune System OK, now that you know your immune system is highly dependent on good nutrition, it's time to begin thinking beyond blueberries, vegetables, and chicken broth, and explore other foods that can give your immune system a boost. Let's delve right into these seven foods, shall we?If you are serious about boosting your immunity, then you must add fermented foods to your diet. Fermented foods are teeming with bene cial bacteria that have an extremely beneficial effect on your gut's immune system, your rst line of defense against pathogens. Fermented foods also boost antibody activity. Some good choices include ke r, kimchi, kombucha, yogurt, miso, tempeh, pickles, and sauerkraut. Look for ones that contain live cultures in the refrigerated section of the store. Organ meats such as liver, kidney, heart, and other \"scary\" parts of an animal are concentrated sources of vitamins A, D, E, and K, B12, omega-3 fatty acids, selenium, and zinc, all of which provide your immune system with tons of concentrated support. When it comes to organ meats, always choose organic and grass-fed/pasture- raised\u2014research has shown that pasture-raised animal products are much higher in these nutrients compared to conventional animal products. Can't stand the taste of organ meats? You'd be surprised at how easy they are to prepare. For example, you can soak liver in milk or lemon juice overnight to remove any \"gamey\" fl avor, dredge it in a couple of whisked eggs, drag it through coconut or almond fl our, saut\u00e9 in coconut oil, and serve with red onions (another good immune system booster chock full of quercetin), mushrooms, and bacon. Bon app\u00e9tit! Coconut oil is rich in lauric acid, which the body converts to monolaurin. Monolaurin is the compound found in breast milk that strengthens a baby's immunity, and a great deal of research has been done establishing the ability of lauric acid to enhance adult's immunity too. This medium- chain fatty acid (MCFA) has the ability to disrupt the lipid membranes of offending organisms and bacteria, rendering them ineffective.Boost Immunity With These 7 F ds!Boost Immunity With These 7 F ds!14 Fermented Foods Fermented Foods Coconut ProductsCoconut ProductsOrgan MeatOrgan Meat When selecting coconuts and coconut oil products, make sure you choose organic versions that are unre ned, unbleached, and made without heat processing or chemicals. One of my favorite, little-known ways to consume coconut products is with the incredibly tasty coconut manna, which is a mix of coconut meat and coconut oil that contains an incredible, fl avorful, buttery pro le perfect for spreading on crackers or eating by the spoonful. The stinky garlic plant is incredibly beneficial to your immune system because it produces a tri-fold effect: it's antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal. I am a rm believer that for optimal immune system function, you should be eating garlic nearly every day. One of the best things about garlic is, unlike antibiotics, bacteria, viruses, and yeast build up no resistance to it. Mushrooms strengthen your immune system because they are rich in protein, ber, vitamin C, B vitamins, calcium, and other minerals. Mushrooms also contain powerful compounds called beta-glucans, which are well-known for their immune enhancing properties. The beta-glucans in medicinal mushrooms (especially reishi, shiitake, and maitake versions) are especially notable for their ability to activate and modulate immune system cells. Beta-glucan also enhances immunity through a variety of other mechanisms, many of which are similar to those of the popular immune-boosting herbs echinacea and astragalus root. For example, beta-glucans bind to macrophages and other scavenger white blood cells of your immune system, thus activating their anti-infection activities. If you visit BenGreen eldFitness.com (my blog and website) and do a search for \"algae,\" you'll nd a host of articles and podcasts I've produced about this amazing, slimy green superfood. Take one version of algae for example...chlorella. As foods go, chlorella is nearly perfect. It is a single- cell freshwater algae that acts as an extremely efficient detoxi cation agent by binding to toxins, such as mercury and other heavy metals, and infectious agents, and then carries them out of your system. The chlorophyll in chlorella also helps you process more oxygen, cleanses your blood, and promotes growth and repair of your tissues. You can nd chlorella in powder and chewable form, and it can be used in smoothies and shakes, sprinkled on salads or soups, or simply eaten as is.When it comes to ghting off pathogens, you simply can't do any better than eating an enormous variety of fresh, organic vegetables for the vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and enzymes they contain. However, when I'm eating vegetables\u2014 especially if they're from an organic source\u2014I actually eat them \"dirty,\" picked fresh from the garden or the produce aisle, so that I can get all the bene cial soil-based probiotics that tend to accumulate on the surface of organic vegetables (and fruits). Don't be afraid of dirt! The good bacteria support your immune system, and as long as you're eating organic, you don't need to worry about pesticides. So now that you know diet plays a key role in supporting a healthy immune system, I encourage you to explore some of those foods you might not be regularly including in your diet, especially these seven immune-boosting foods!GarlicGarlic ShroomsShrooms AlgaeAlgaeDirty VegetablesDirty Vegetables15 References available upon request. PRIME YOUR IMMUNE SYSTEM FOR FLU SEASON WITH CRANBERRY! For a long time now, the humble cranberry has been relegated to an oft-ignored condiment at Thanksgiving, but it appears the time has come for this little fruit to shine. A growing body of research is revealing that the cranberry has some unique and powerful properties when it comes to immunity. Recent studies have found that compounds in cranberries interfere with the fl u virus' ability to replicate and establish an infection, in addition to reducing the symptoms of the fl u. \"Cranberries are incredibly rich in proanthocyanidins, which exert a regulatory effect on human immune cells, priming them to ght off an infection,\" Jonathan Clinthorne, PhD, whose doctoral work focused on nutritional immunology, explains. Clinthorne says that these proanthocyanidins seem to be especially bene cial to our immune barriers\u2014the GI tract, the urinary tract, and the mouth. \"These are the places where infection can take hold, so if we strengthen these areas, we can prevent viruses and bacterial infections from taking hold in the rst place.\" The results of one human study support this idea: the proliferation of a speci c type of T-cell\u2014an immune cell found in the immune barriers and a rst line of defense against infection\u2014was nearly ve times higher after 10 weeks of daily consumption of a cranberry beverage. Researchers have also discovered that cranberry juice can inhibit the norovirus (the dreaded stomach fl u) from adhering to human cells, the essential rst step in initiating an infection. Cranberry has been shown to have similar anti-adhering effects on certain types of bacteria, including E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus (staph) , and even bacteria that has become increasingly resistant to antibiotics. The most effective way to use cranberry is as a preventative; i.e., start taking it before you get sick. \"Proanthocyanidins only stay in the body for about 6-12 hours, so it should be taken twice daily to maintain consistent levels,\" Clinthorne says.By Lindsay Wilson HEALTHY & DELICIOUS RECIPES 16 Shorter days, cooler nights, a new school year... a shift in seasons has begun. With seasonal changes afoot, now is also a good time to make a shift in your diet, from conventional produce to organic. According to current estimates, nearly 1 billion pounds of pesticides are used each year in the United States, and their residues inevitably end up on our food, and in our bodies. Take apples, for example. A favorite fall food staple, apples rank number two on the Environmental Working Group's (EWG) \"Dirty Dozen,\" a consumer's guide that ranks produce with the highest number and concentrations of pesticides, with nearly 100% testing positive for residues. That should make you think twice before heading to your favorite \"u-pick\" orchard. Kale and other leafy greens were no better. According to the USDA tests that the EWG bases its list on, 51 different pesticides\u2014some of them highly toxic to the human nervous system\u2014were detected on kale samples. Overall, nearly three quarters of 6,953 produce samples tested by the USDA contained pesticide residues, with some persisting even when the produce was washed and peeled. So what's a concerned consumer to do? Opt for organic! You are not only avoiding ingesting toxic pesticides, but organic produce has also been shown to have higher levels of nutrients, including health-promoting phytonutrients. See the full \"Dirty Dozen\" at www.ewg.org. FREE ONLINERECIPESFALL IN LOVE WITH ORGANICS! Make the dressing by whisking together the lemon juice, olive oil, Dijon mustard, honey, and \u00bc teaspoon salt. In a salad bowl add the kale and toss with the dressing to coat all leaves well; set aside for approximately 10 minutes while preparing the remaining ingredients. To matchstick the apple, cut it in half, lay it on the cutting board skin side up, slice thinly toward the core. Take the apple slices and stack them together and slice again to make matchsticks. In a skillet over medium heat, toast the walnut pieces. Stir often and watch closely to avoid burning. Once done, transfer to a small bowl and set aside. Cut the bacon slices into thin strips. In the same skillet used to toast the walnuts, cook the bacon bits over medium heat, stirring frequently until nicely browned. Once done, transfer the bacon bits to a small plate or bowl and set aside. Add the apples, dates, walnuts, and cheese to the kale. Toss well and top with the bacon bits right before serving.
