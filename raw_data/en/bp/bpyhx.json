Pillars of Wellness, located in Burlington, Aldershot, specializes in the use of acupuncture techniques to provide relief from common stresses and anxieties. The Stress Detox treatment involves the gentle placement of five small, sterilized, disposable stainless-steel needles in specific sites on each ear of a patient undergoing treatment, as regulated by the [National Acupuncture Detoxification Association](https://acudetox.com/) (NADA)-standardized 3- to 5-point ear acupuncture protocol. Like with most acupuncture treatments, the recipients won't feel significant pain. The recipients sit quietly in a group setting for 30 to 45 minutes as they undergo treatment. It is mostly a non-verbal process with minimal interaction between patient and practitioner. There is no patient assessment conducted and it is usually done in a larger room to accommodate other patients who will undergo the same treatment simultaneously. We call this \"community acupuncture\", and it can help reduce costs to the patient while contributing to the communal, peaceful healing space necessary for the treatment. If needed, however, the treatment can be done privately one-on-one. The Stress Detox treatment is completely safe for those receiving treatments from other healthcare providers. Benefits of Stress Detox with Acupuncture Acupuncture needles don't heal the patient; rather, they simply assist the body with healing itself through stimulating blood vessels and tissues. Stress Detox often helps participants become relaxed and more comfortable with their own thoughts and emotions. This enables them to experience a sense of \"letting go\". With an open mind and proper treatment, participates release their tensions and apprehensions to support quiet participation in a group setting. Above all, Stress Detox facilitates your relationship with yourself and others. What Conditions Can Stress Detox with Acupuncture Help Treat?
