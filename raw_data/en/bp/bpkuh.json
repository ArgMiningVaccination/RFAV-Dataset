Although Allopathy, modern medical science has taken over the world, many people still trust and rely on Ayurveda. So, as a normal individual who is suffering from any health issues, a common question generally arises before starting any treatment- Allopathy or Ayurveda? So here are a few reasons to switch to our ancient medical science, Ayurveda. Contents [1 Allopathy is derived from the Greek word 'allos' which means 'other' or 'different' and 'pathos' which means 'other than the disease'. Ayurveda: Ayurveda is a Sanskrit word derived from 'Ayus' meaning 'life' and 'Veda' meaning 'knowledge' or 'science'. So, term Ayurveda means 'the knowledge of life'. Treatment- Allopathy vs Ayurveda Allopathy: In Allopathy, doctors try to treat the symptoms of the disease. They just do what they can do to ease the symptoms of a particular disease. Allopathy does not focus fully on the root cause of the problem. The drugs offered in Allopathy are made only to cure the symptoms and not the original cause of the disease. Ayurveda: Ayurveda focuses on finding the root cause of the problem and treating it at that level. It objects to discovering the origin of a disease and then eliminating it fully from the patient. [Ayurvedic treatment](https://trustayur.com) is centered around the patient's whole lifestyle and food habits to heal them completely. Side effects- Allopathy vs Ayurveda Allopathy: In Allopathy, there is a pill for every symptom and then there is a pill for each of the side effects caused by that pill.

Treatment time- Allopathy vs Ayurveda Allopathy Allopathy may promise you quick treatment time, but in reality, your body takes a long time to fully recover from the side effects of the drugs.
