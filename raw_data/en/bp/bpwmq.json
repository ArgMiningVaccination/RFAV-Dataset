Our members are graduates of accredited four-year, graduate-level, in-residence naturopathic medical programs. MAND is dedicated to advancing the principles of naturopathic medicine and expanding Maine's consumers' access to this important prevention-based form of health care. In Maine, Naturopathic Doctors (ND's) must hold a doctorate in naturopathic medicine from one of five accredited naturopathic medical schools in North America. This degree is a guarantee to the public that the holder possesses the required didactic and clinical training to practice Naturopathic Medicine. The doctorate degree prepares ND's to be excellent general practitioners and to work together with other medical providers. Naturopathic Doctors are experts in the use of natural therapies and drug/nutrient, drug/herb interactions. For this reason, Naturopathic Doctors are nationally recognized as experts in the field of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM) and are included in the White House Commission on CAM and the advisory board for the National Institutes of Health.
