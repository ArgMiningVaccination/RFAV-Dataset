Pathway to Digitalize Regulatory Information Management Systems for National Medicines Regulatory Authorities in Low - and Middle - Income Countries Septemb er 2022 USAID MEDICINES, TECHNOLOGIES, AND PHARMACEUTICAL SERVICES (MTaPS) PROGRAM Improved Access. Improved Services. Better Health Outcomes. About the USAID MTaPS Program Funded by the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by a team led by Management Sciences for Health, the purpose of the five -year Medicines , Technologies , and Pharmaceutical Services (MTaPS ) Program (2018 -2023) is to provide pharm aceutical system strengthening assistance for sustained improvements in health system performance and to advance USAID's goals of preventing child and maternal deaths, controlling the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and combating infectious disease threats, as well as expanding essential health coverage. The goal of MTaPS is to help low - and middle -income countries strengthen their pharmaceutical systems to ensure sustainable access to and appropriate use of safe, effective, quality -assured, and affordable essential medicines, vaccines, and other health technologies and pharmaceutical services. About the USAID PQM+ Program Promoting the Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) is a program operating under a USAID -funded cooperative agreement with the US Pharmacopeia l Convention (USP) with a goal to sustainably strengthen medical product quality assurance (QA) systems by providing technical assistance to manufacturers of priority health products and build in -country capacity of medicines regulatory authorities to improve product r egistration, inspection, and post -marketing surveillance for product quality. PQM+ support also includes accreditation of national drug quality control laboratories per International Organization for Standardization ( ISO)/International Electrotechnical Com mission (IEC) 17025 and/or World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification standards in low - and middle -income countries. PQM+ uses a system strengthening approach to program implementation to enhance sustainability [1]. The program considers the entire system when designing and delivering technical assistance, focusing on the interaction among all health systems functions as they relate to medical product quality ass urance [2]. To implement PQM+, USP joined forces with a diversified consortium of four core partners, six field -led extension partners, and eight technical resource partners whose ex tensive technical expertise can be drawn on to achieve desired results [3].

These standards should be incorporated into digitalization activities for a regulatory IMS and serve as the basis for harmonizing regulatory processes across NMRAs. The meeting s brought together experts in regulatory system s strengthening and IMS representing several low- and middle - income countries (LMICs) and regional and global organizations . The objectives of the consultative process were to: Clearly identify the critical gaps and challenges NMRAs and other stakeholders face with a regulatory IMS for the eight regulatory functions outlined in the World Healt h Organization (WHO ) Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) for evaluation of national regulatory systemsa [4] Use existing IMS and regulatory standards to derive a recommended set of MCS for a regulatory IMS to address identified gaps and challenges , including developing selection criteria for prioritizing which standards to include in the set of recommended standards Develop a use case for the MCS and help promote their adoption and use The consultations spanned a 10 -month period and comprised four virtual mee tings, supplemented by written feedback and one -on-one and small group sessions , to achieve the stated process objectives. Through this process, a minimum common set of standards for digitalization of a regulatory IMS was identified ( figure A). This docume nt is intended for decision makers at NMRAs in LMICs to guide their adoption of the minimum set of common standards for a regulatory IMS within the broader context of digitalization for a regulatory IMS. The document outline s the steps needed to digitalize a regulatory IMS and highlight s key considerations for the process. The document begins with an overview of the minimum common set of standards for digitalization of a regulatory IMS and the benefits and guiding principles for a digitalized regulatory IMS . Prerequisites for digitalization are presented , including the legal and regulatory framework , quality management system (QMS) , human resources, financing mechanisms , and adoption of MCS that should be in place prior to digitalization. Preliminary steps for undertaking digitalization include a rapid feasibility assessment and development of system requirements specifications (SRS) , followed by the actual implementation of the digital regulatory IMS. Maintenance and sustainability consid erations should be articulated well in a The GBT Revision VI version 1 \"comprises eight regulatory functions (Registration and Marketing Authorization, Vigilance, Market Surveillance and Control, Licensing Establishments, Regulatory Inspection, Laboratory Testing, Clinical Trials Oversig ht, and NRA Lot Release) under the overarching framework of the national regulatory syste m.\" USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 9 advance of implementation and include written procedures, data quality, monitoring and evaluation (M&E), and political support.

Despite the benefits, adoption of IMS in low - and middle -income countries (LMICs) remains disproportionately low in comparison to high -income countries . Many LMICs rely on paper -based processes or IMS that are underutilized , fragmented, noninteroperable , or mismanaged. The delayed implementation of digital IMS has been attributed to a lack of adequate financial and human resources, a lack of political will , and other factors. Consequently, there is an absence of effective communication among regulatory agencies, a lack of transparency in the regulatory process, information loss, backlogs, and delays in the regulatory approval process. The lack of interoperable digital IMS in LMICs and the absence of standardized common technical documents ( CTDs ), documentation, work processes, and timelines limit the use of harmonization actions such as joint assessments and Good Manufacturing Practices ( GMP) site inspections . Implementation of r egulatory procedures such as relia nce and recognition for the registration of medical products require s the deployment of dependable regulatory IMS for efficient information management. To further harmonization efforts, a set of MCS for regulatory IMS is required to promote interoperability and communication among departments within NMRAs and among NMRAs , stakeholders, and regional and international organizations . The US Agency for International Development (USAID) Medicines, Technologies, and Pharmaceuti cal Services (MTaPS) Program and Promoting the Quality of Medicines Plus (PQM+) Program initiated a series of consultative meetings with regulatory experts to define a minimum set of applicable common standards for regulatory IMS that would streamline work flows and regulatory processes, ensure uniform data capture, and enable data exchange within and among NMRAs and other stakeholders who support regulatory convergence and harmonization efforts. MINIMUM COMMON STANDARDS FOR REGULATORY IMS To further harmon ization efforts, a set of MCS for regulatory IMS is required to promote interoperability and communication between international and regional NMRAs. Further, digitalization of regulatory IMS promotes consistency, quality, efficiency, and transparency of re gulatory system function within and across NMRAs. The MTaPS and PQM+ programs completed a series of consultative meetings with experts in regulatory system strengthening and IMS representing several LMICs and regional and global organizations and an extensive review of existing literature to define a minimum set of applicable common standards for regulatory IMS. USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 11 The following criteria were used to select the minimum set of common standards: Relevance \u2014the standard should be critical for at least one of the eight core regulatory functions as defined in the World Health Organization ( WHO ) Global Benchmarking Tool (GBT) v2.0 [4] extent to which NMRAs' capacity and resources feasibly allow adoption and the anticipated efficiency gains Criticality \u2014what would countries gain by applying or lose by not applying a given standard Universality \u2014whether a given standard is recommended by WHO and the extent to which it is widely used The list of 56 identified standards was circulated to all participants in the consultative process. Participants were asked to evaluate each of the 56 standards on a scale of 1 to 3 for each of the selection criteria . Definitions for each rating are inclu ded in table 1. During this selection exercise, relevance was excluded from participant consideration as the 56 identified standards were deemed relevant for inclusion by the MTaPS and PQM+ teams during the literature review process. Table 1 - Rating defin itions by selection criteria Rating Scale Feasibility Criticality Universality 1 Adopted with greater difficulty, significant technical assistance required Regulatory performance/processes not impacted without the standard Not widely used in LMICs 2 Adopted with medium difficulty, marginal technical assistance required Regulatory performance/processes may be impacted without the standard The use of the standard is moderately widespread 3 Adopted with minimal, if any, technical assistance Regulatory performance/processes impacted without the standard Widely used or recommended by industry or normative bodies USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 12 These 56 standards were further divided into three categories: Figure B - Categories of Standards The final list of MCS was developed based on analysis of the feedback received from 11 respondents and informed by the MTaPS and PQM+ teams' expertise across regulatory functions. All of the identified process stand ards, except for those pertaining specifically to medical devices, were selected for inclusion in the set of MCS. The standards pertaining to medical devices were excluded to align with the WHO GBT v2.0 (medicines and vaccines). Respon dents expected that s tandards for medical devices would be included in a future set of MCS. The remaining process standards are considered prerequisite to digitalizing regulatory IMS or adopting other standards (e.g., data dictionaries, knowledge trees, data exchange). The lis t of standards recommended for adoption is below, listed in 1) Process or workflow standards 2) Pharmaceutical standard dictionaries and knowledge trees 3) Data exchange standards Pertain to: Information and communications technology Management information system functions Determine how data should be structured, defined, formatted Examples: Common Technical Document (CTD) format Extensible Markup Language (XML) Platforms such as Fast Health Interoperability Resources (FHIR\u00ae) Master or reference lists for: Terminology Nomenclature Hierarchies Examples: Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) International Nonproprietary Name (INN) Apply to pharmaceutical: Procedures Processes Workflows Examples: Good practices (GXPs) such as Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards such as ISO 9001:2 015 USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 13 order from the most to least feasible to adopt (figure C).

The objective of GRevP is to help achieve timeliness, predictability, consiste ncy, transparency, clarity, efficiency, and high quality in both the content and management of reviews [13]. Good Storage Practices Guidelines that describe the special measures considered appropriate for the storage and transportation of pharmaceuticals. The guidelines are applicable to not only manufacturers of medicinal products but also pharmaceutical importe rs, contractors and wholesalers, and community and hospital pharmacies [14]. ICH Q10 A guideline for a QMS that applies to manufacturers of pharmaceutical products . The ICH Q10 model incorporates aspects of GMP and ISO standards to develop a pharmaceutical QMS across the product life cycle [15,16] . Good Pharmacovigilance Practices A set of guidelines for the conduct of pharmacovigilance for MA holders and regulatory agencies. The definition and principles vary across regulatory bodies [17,18] . USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 16 Standard Description Data Dictionaries and Knowledge Trees International Nonproprietary Name (INN) Used globally to identify unique pharmaceutical substances o r APIs . Nonproprietary names are also known as generic names and are public property [19]. National Drug Code (NDC) Drug products are identified and reporte d to the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) as required by US law using a unique, three -segment number called the NDC, which is a universal product identifier for human drugs. The US FDA inputs the full NDC number and the information submitted as part of the listing process into a database known as the Drug Registration and Listing System [20]. Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Index In the ATC classification system, active substances are divided into different groups according to the organ or system on which they act and the ir therapeutic, pharmacological, and chemical properties. Drugs are classified in groups at five levels [21]. WHODrug Global WHODrug Global is the international reference for medicinal product information and is maintained by the Uppsala Monitoring Centre. With its unique drug code hierarchy and extensive coverage, it provides a consistent drug dictionary with exa ct terminology when coding concomitant medications [22]. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) An extensive medical terminology designed for use in the regulation of medical products with a unique architecture and features that support public health monitoring, data analysis, communication (both electronic and traditional), and data management. This terminology is hierarchical, multiaxial, multilingual, regularly updated, and strictly maintained [23]. Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) registry number A unique numeric identi fier that designates only one substance and links to the CAS registry entry that contains information about a specific chemical substance [24]. Unique Ingredient Identifier Alphanumeric identifier linked to a substance's molecular structur e or descriptive information and generated by the Global Substance Registration System of the US FDA. It classifies substances as chemical, protein, nucleic acid, polymer, structurally diverse, or mixture [25,26] . ISO 11240 Units of Measurement Part of the Identification of Medical Products (IDMP) suite of standards developed by ISO. Establishes conventions for using units of measurement , requirements for linkages to international measurement standards , and rules for unit mapping and translation [27]. ISO 11239 Dosage Form and Route of Administration Part of the IDMP suite of standards developed by ISO.

Used to group similar or identical pharmaceutical products based on substance, product strength , reference strength, and dosage form. Standardizes exchange of pharmaceutical product information based on these data elements [27]. ISO 11238 Substance Identification Part of the IDMP suite of standards developed by ISO. Defines medical products in terms of their constituent substance s. Standardizes exchange of pharmaceutical product information based on these characteristics [27]. GS1 Standards Provides for the use of unambiguous identification keys to identify goods, services, assets, locations, etc., worldwide. These keys can be represented in data carriers, such as barcodes or EPC/RFID tags, to enable automatic data capture. They may also be used in electronic communications, improving speed and accuracy when sharing master data, transactional data , and visibility event data [28]. ISO 11615 Medicinal Product Identification Part of the IDMP suite of standards developed by ISO. Used to identify medical products using standard data elements including product name; clinical particulars (e.g., indications, contraindications); substance ; dosage form ; route of administration; medicinal packaging; MA; manufacturer ) [27]. USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 18 Standard Description Data Exchange Standards Portable Document Format (PDF) A data exchange format used to present and exchange documents reliably \u2014independent of software, hardware, or operating system. The PDF is now an open standard maintained by ISO. PDF documents can contain links and buttons, form fields, audio, video, and business logic. They can be signed electronically, and you can easily view PDF files on Windows or Mac OS [29]. XML A simple text -based format for representing structured information (e.g., documents, data, configuration, books, transactions, invoices). XML is one of the most widely used format s for sharing structured information between programs, people, and computers and people, both locally and across networks [30]. Common Technical Document (CTD) A common format for all quality, safety , and efficacy information for application for MA [31]. E2B - Pharmacovigilance: Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSR) or ISO/ Health Level 7 (HL7) 27953 -2:2011 A standardized framework for international regulatory reporting and information sharing by providing a common set of data elements and a messaging format for transmission of ICSR for adverse drug reactions (ADR s), adverse events, infections, and incidents th at can occur upon the administration of one or more human pharmaceutical products to a patient, regardless of source and destination [32]. Structured Product Labelling A document markup standard approved by HL7 and adopted by the US FDA as a mechanism for exchanging product and facility information [33]. Fast Healthcare Interoperability Standards (FHIR) A standard for exchanging health care information electronically. Health care records are increasingly becoming digitized. As patients move around the health care ec osystem, their electronic health records must be available, discoverable, and understandable. Further, to support automated clinical decision support and other machine -based processing, the data must be structured and standardized [34]. USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 19 The MCS should be incorporated into digitalization activities for a regulatory IMS and serve as the basis for harmonizing regulatory processes across NMRAs. They feed into the SRS that are foundational for the development of regulatory IMS digitalization tools . NMRAs' a doption of the identified common standards would enable the creation of a common language for system design and guide digitalized regulatory IMS development or i mprovement in LMICs. BENEFITS OF DIGITALIZED REGULATORY INFORMATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS Digitalization of a regulatory IMS in NMRAs facilitates transparency and promotes efficiency and expedited delivery of regulatory services. Effective regulatory services contribute significantly to improved pharmaceutical services and health care outcomes. The implementation of th is guidance for digitalization of a regulatory IMS incorporating the set of MCS will: Create a common reference for use among regulators, software developers, and policy makers for a regulatory IMS Streamline NMRAs' internal operations , such as workflow management , throughout the life cycle of medical products, performance metric tracking, and reporting Facilitate convergence and harmonization of regulatory services both within and outside of a defined NMRA Enhance the ability of NMRAs to collaborate and share infor mation with one another , including the use of reliance and recognition mechanisms Improve communication and enhance evidence -based decision making by NMRAs PURPOSE OF GUIDANCE The purpose of this document is to guide regulatory system decision makers and s takeholders in LMICs on the adoption of the identified set of MCS for a regulatory IMS. The document outlin es the strategies required to develop a pathway for adoption of the standards and identifi es the necessary human, financial, and technical resources for effective regulatory IMS deployment within the context of digitalization . PRINCIPLES OF DIGITALIZATION Accessible digital technology has been a game changer for international development \u2014leadin g to major innovations and improvements across sectors, including health. The inclusion of digital tools in routine health system operations can lead to greater efficiency, improved outcomes, and gr eater connections among the global community . Some digital ly enabled programs fail , however , and quite often the reasons for failure are predictable and preventable [35]. To avoid or mitigate such pitfalls, the global community drafted The Principles for Digital Development \u2014nine living guidelines to assist in incorporating best practices into technology -driven systems throughout the project life cycle . First created in 2012 in consultation with organizations such as The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Swedish International Development Agency, U nited Nations Children's Fund, U nited Nations Development Program, World Bank, USAID, and WHO , the Principles USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 20 incorporate lessons learned and global standards . The principles should provide the basis for the process of digitalizing a regulatory IMS or any digital tool, system, or intervention. The nine principles are: [36] Design with the User : User -centered design starts with getting to know the people you are designing for through conversation, observation, and co -creation. Understand the Existing Ecosystem : Well -designed initiatives and digital tools consider the particular structures and ne eds that exist in each country, region , and community. Design for Scale : Achieving scale requires adoption beyond an initiative 's pilot population and often necessitates securing funding or partners that take the initiative to new communities or regions. Build for Sustainability : Building sustainable programs, platforms , and digital tools is essential to maintain user and stakeholder support and maximize long -term impact . Be Data Driven : When an initiative is data driven, quality information is available to the right people when they need it, and they us e those data to take action. Use Open Standards, Open Data, Open Source, and Open Innovation : An open approach to digital development can help to increase collaboration in the digital development community an d avoid duplicating work that has already been done. Reuse and Improve : Reusing and improving is about taking the work of the global development community further than any organization or program can do alone. Address Privacy and Security : Addressing priva cy and security in digital development involves careful consideration of which data are collected and how data are acquired, used, stored , and shared. Be Collaborative : Being collaborative means sharing information, insights, strategies , and resources acro ss projects, organizations , and sectors, leading to increased efficiency and impact .b PREREQUISITES FOR DIGITALIZATION OF REGULATORY SYSTEMS Before embarking on the process of digitalization for a regulatory IMS, several key considerations and elements need to be factored into planning. These include the policy and legal landscape ; political support ; and key infrastructure, including adequate human resources and financing. The SRS should be well developed and based on feasibility assessment find ings prior to implementation. LEGISLATION , REGULATIONS , AND GUIDELINES One of the reasons for the delayed implementation of a digital regulatory IMS in LMICs has been a lack of political will, which may imply a lack of a legal framework that includes the adoption and implementation of digitalization for a regulatory IMS. Public confidence and trust among regulatory authorities re quires effective and efficient regulation built on a sound legal basis. It is because of this that legality is included as part of the nine principles for GRP [38]. WHO emphasizes that a legal fra mework \"should support and empower regulatory authorities to contribute to and benefit from all forms of cooperation, \" and ideally, this should be stated explicitly in the legal framework [38]. Regarding b For a compendium of lessons learned from implementing the Principles, refer to: From Principle to Practice: Implementing the Principles for Digital Development [37] USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 21 digitalization in particular, the legal framework should allow the regulatory authority to implement digitalized systems and enable flexibility and agility over time. WHO defines a regulatory framework as \"the collection of laws, regulations, guidelines, guidance documents , and other regulatory instruments through which a government and a regulatory authority control particular aspects of a specific activity ,\" [38]. Legal and regulatory considerations for digitalization should be incorporated into the broader regulatory framework.c To identify the degree to which a digital regulatory IMS is included in the relevant legislation, the regulatory authority should carry out a g ap analysis. The results of this assessment will aid in setting priorities for updating the existing regulatory framework to ensure the adoption and digitalization of a minimum set of common standards for a regulatory IMS. The laws should also address coor dination with other bodies such as the Ministry of Technology ; Ministr y of Information, Communications, and Technology ; or its equivalent to receive support from and align with these institutions' policies when necessary. The inclusion of a digital regulat ory IMS within the regulatory framework will ensure that as technology advances there will be no legal impediments to the use of new systems or technologies within the execution of regulatory activities. This will ensure that harmonization and exchange of information with other regulatory authorities is always an option. QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM A QMS is a collection of business processes focused on continuously meeting internal and external customer needs and enhancing client satisfaction. It is aligned with an organization's purpose and strategic direction and encompasses activities by which the organization identifies its objectives and specifies the processes and reso urces required to achieve desired results. A QMS controls the interdependent processes and resources necessary to deliver value and achieve results for key stakeholders. It enables top-level management to optimize the use of resources considering long - and short -term implications and provides the means to identify ways to address intended and unintended consequences in the provision of goods and services (risk -based thinking) [40,41] . National regulatory authorities should apply a QMS to all business processes , includ ing implementation of a digitalized regulatory IMS to increase efficiency and promote sustainability, improving the availability of safe, high-quality , and effective medical products in the market. The information flowing through a digital regulatory IMS is dynamic and requires a proactive approach to management , allowing users to quickly identify and respond to system malfunction, incorporat e new technology and continuous improvement measures, and respond to customer needs. NMRAs should int egrate a QMS for a regulatory IMS into their regulatory functions , including the deployment of an electronic document control management system. c For more information pertaining to regulatory frameworks, please refer to : WHO Expert Committee on Specifications for Pharmaceutical Preparations: Fifty -fifth repo rt. Annex 11 [38] WHO global model regulatory framework for medical devices including in vitro diagnos tic medical devices, documents [39] USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 22 ISO 9001 is the international standard that outlines the requirements for a QMS. It consists of eight QMS prin ciples that organizations should adhere to : Customer focus Leadership Engagement of people Process approach System approach to management Continuous improvemen t Fact-based approach to decision making Mutually beneficial supplier relationship [42] It also contains subclauses on the Plan -Do-Check -Act cycle, a four -step process for carrying out continuous improvement : Plan: recognize an opportunity and plan a change Do: study the change Check : analyze the results of the test and identify the lessons learned Act: act based on what you learned changing the plan if it did not work or implementing it if it were successful and plan new improvements, beginning the cycle again An effective QMS i s a prerequisite for ISO 9001 certification and attainment of Maturity Level (ML) 3 according to the WHO GBT. The WHO GBT is an evaluation tool designed to analyze various regulatory functions and assign a n ML score to the regulatory system, ranging from 1 (certain aspects of regulatory duties) to 4 (advanced system) [4]. ISO 9001:2 015 sections 4 -10 provide QMS sub indicators for audit, 14 of which have been included in the WHO GBT. NMRA s must fulfill seven GBT sub indicators associate d with a QMS to reach ML 4, six QMS sub indicators to obtain ML 3, and one QMS sub indicator to achieve ML 2 [42]. An effective QMS will help to ensure a smooth transition from a paper -based to a digitalized regulatory IMS. Clear and updated standard operating procedures (SOPs) should be in place to serve as a reference for the development of SRS for digitalized systems and tools . The NMRA should implement a QMS in a phased manner that involves awareness creation , orientation of all personnel in the organization on QMS principles and benefits, training of personnel, and performance of internal quality audits that inform continuous improvement effort s. Incorporating QMS principles in the implementation of a digital ized regulatory IMS can increase overall performance and efficiency . It can reduce waste and promote sustainable development by granting NMRAs greater control over processes and operation s and improve harmonization efforts within and between regulators in LMIC s. POLITICAL SUPPORT NMRAs require full support and commitment from various government ministries and agencies to operate efficiently. As such, any initiative (including implementation and use of a digital regulatory IMS) also requires government commi tment. This will include the Ministries of Information , Communication , USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 23 and Technology (ICT) ; Justice ; Finance ; Health ; customs ; and police. Proper collaboration among the various agencies and better communication and coordination are important to gain buy -in for a regulatory IMS. A working group comprising relevant ministries and agencies should be formed to provide guidance and input in the development of a digital reg ulatory IMS. During the assessment phase, key stakeholders should be identified and engaged throughout the process , ensuring their support of and contribut ions to the digital regulatory IMS initiative. HUMAN RESOURCES From planning a digital regulatory IM S through implementation , integration , and routine use , human resource considerations are critical to success. It is important to consider not only the necessary competencies of existing staff but also what new roles will be needed and what initial technical support is required to plan and implement a digital regulatory IMS given the existing workload within the N MRA. Considerations relating to human resources throughout the stages of implementing a digitalized regulatory IMS include: 1. Plannin g - Implementing a digital regulatory IMS for the first time or upgrading it is a major projects that need to be carefully planned with the full engagement of NMRA staff. External expertise in information technology (IT) project implementation and change management may be required to ensure successful implementation. The s uccess of such projects depend s on staff engagement and acceptance of the new system with the understanding that a full change management process needs to be considered in addition to the technical and financial requirements of digital regulatory IMS installation. Do not underestimate the extra workload and time needed for both planning and implementation , plan for extra staff and consultants for the proj ect, and ensure that the overall process is led by senior N MRA staff. The planning process should include detailed consideration of the new competencies required by existing staff as well as of new staff positions that may be required to manage, update , and support the system . 2. Implementation - Digital r egulatory IMS installation requires careful planning and stepwise implementation, overseen by a senior N MRA staff member . Employment and re trainin g processes can take significant time and need to be thought through carefully to ensure alignment with the roll out of the system. Workload considerations are very important during this stage , as time is taken away from routine N MRA activities for trainin g and systems testing . Often , parallel processes will be in use for a time before the digital regulatory IMS is fully integrated. As part of the change management process , expect staff res istance and concern , which makes ongoing communication and engagement with staff critical. SOPs, job descriptions, organograms , onboarding , supervision, and staff development systems will need to be updated. 3. Integration and routine use - For a digital regulatory IMS to be truly integrated into t he day-to-day work flow of an N MRA, the IT system needs to be maintained and updated and the software used appropriately. Access to IT competence from either within the NMRA or through contractual arrangements is required to ensur e that IT staff are routinely available for all actions required to maintain and update the software and provide help desk support to users . All staff engaged in process flows supported by a digital regulatory IMS will require competence to use USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 24 the system , including data entry, monitoring of process flows , and acting on key performance indicators. At this stage , carefully consider workflow responsibilities and ensure that multiple people are trained and maintain their ability to complete various fun ctions required by the system . This approach builds in red undancy to guard against staff unavailability due to leave and staff turnover. Robust supportive supervision , systematic onboarding of new staff , and continued professional development will help optimize u se of the system.d ADEQUATE FINANCING MECHANISMS There should be adequate and sustainable financing mechanisms derived from fees charged by the NMRA for the services it renders and financing from government, donors, and development partners to cover the costs for the assessment, planning, implementation, infrastructure, monitoring , and evaluation of digital regulatory IMS activities. These include funds for adequate human resources ( e.g., management staff, regulatory staff, IT staff, administrative staff) ; integration of the MCS; software design and development ; hardware ; server hosting and other IT infrastructure ; M&E; and database management , including backup, security , and maintenance. NMRAs cannot rely solely on fees (charged for routine regulatory services) to ensure efficient and enforceable regulation. It is critical that the government provide financial support, at least during the initial phase of operation of the NMRA , until the N MRA becomes financially self-reliant. The following options for sustainable financing could be considered to help the NMRA achieve its organizational goals and ensure sustainability: A cost-recovery scheme (CRS) can be used for charging fees to incrementally recoup a portion or the entirety of costs incurred to deliver regulatory activities or program s. The CRS should be adopted or introduced in a phase approach over a period of time . For example: - Year 1 : Conduct desk review /situational analysis; define scope and propose fee structure; socialize or consult key stakeholders , including pharmaceutical and health industries , through a consultative workshop; and develop the CRS document and its implementation plan - Years 2-3: Imple mentation plan execution starting with the main priority functional areas - From Year 3: Expand the digitalization of regulatory IMS to pharmacovigilance , followed by laboratory testing and l ot release . Consider using phased implementation of incremental fee s over time , starting with charging CRS fees of 40% of the estimated cost of the NMRA's operations . - By Year 5 : Increase this to 60% - Years 8 -10: Increase this to 80% Through resource mobilization strategies, NMRAs can engage stakeholders, including government, donors/development partners , community, technical agencies, programs, and nongovernmental organizations , to contribute to achieving the NMRA's financing goals. For d For more information, refer to: IS/IT systems implementation projects tools and techniq ues for success , Project Management Institute [43] How To Implement Change Management When Selecting New Software , Technology Innovation Center [44] Strategic Training Executive Programme (leadership & change management) , People that Deliver [45] USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 25 example, a coalition of interested parties could suppor t and build the regulatory and quality assurance systems for medical products' quality, safety , and efficacy to safeguard public health against substandard and falsified products. With this option, resources could cover both financial (e.g., funds, capital, physical infrastructure, cash) and nonfinancial ( e.g., staff and their skills and competencies; materials like equipment/instrument, hardware, computers, software, and stationary ) that each stakeholder could support based on their nature and scope of assistance. Key steps of resource mobilization include: Conduct ing a situational analysis to determine resource needs Develop ing strategies and plans to identify sources of resources Raising a wareness among key stakeholders, including government, donors, the development community, technical agencies and program s, and nongovernmental organizations Leveraging resources and build ing partnerships with agencies/program to get buy -in Develop ing the action p lan and M&E frameworks Implementing the action plan for resource mobilization and conducting M&E SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATIONS The actual development of a digitalized regulatory IMS needs to be based on SRS , which should be developed by the software developers and regulatory experts who will ultimately use the system . The SRS describes the clients' needs through workflows, roles and responsibilities , and functionality. The main purpose is to ensure that the developed system meets the clients' requirements. The MCS for a regulatory IMS should be incorporated throughout the document and should guide the selection and definition of the components outline d below. Process standards should be used to define regulatory functions, processes, and user requirements ; data dictionaries and knowledge trees provide common language for required software and processes ; and data exchange standards should be used to ide ntify appropriate hardware and software and guide the functionality of the regulatory IMS.e A typical SRS includes several sections , which are explained below. User requirements This section is adapted from \"What Is Role -Based Access Control? Definition, Key Components, and Best Practices\" by Chiradeep BasuMallick [47]. Typical users of a regulatory IMS consist of two group s: External business clients (e.g., pharmaceutical companies, importers , manufacturers, pharmacy owners, wholesalers, laboratories ) Internal NMRA staff who review applications from external users and approve or deny various applications (e.g., MA, import licenses) e To facilitate the process of writing the SRS, the international standard template can be used [46] USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 26 To ensure that all users have access to the functions they nee d, a digitalized regulatory IMS should consider several distin ct groups of users and define role-based access control within the regulatory IMS according to the need : External users (e.g., pharmacy owners, pharmaceutical industry, importers/ exports ) Internal NMRA basic ) Role-based access control should build on: Users: Typically, an individual or company representative Roles : See the three groups above Operations (e.g., regulatory IMS system administration ) Objects : Viewing reports in the regulatory IMS or any other area that does not change the system state Permissions (e.g., submit an application for an import permit or review a n MA application ) Sessions : A regulatory IMS must have a log func tionality that monitors all the above according to when a given user logs in a nd what actions they take Hardware and Software There are several considerations regarding the choice of hardware and software for regulatory IMS installation/deployment : 1. Choice of hosting: Local laws and regulations must be considered. Some countries ' regulations require that hosting be on local premises , which may require hardware procurement with cost implications . Regulatory IMS authorities must comply with local laws and regulations regarding hosting requirements . a. Cloud server i. Easy to design for scale as cloud solutions typically are elastic ii. Eliminates or reduces the hardware maintenance aspect , potentially leading to a more sustainable deployment over time iii. Readily accessi ble with an internet connection iv. Server management not a concern b. On-premises server i. Data are kept within the NMRA 's local physical infrastructure ii. Requires human and financial resources for server management and maintenance c. A hybrid of cloud server and on-premises server i. Allows the NMRA to keep confidential information on the premises and use the cloud for advanced data processing 2. Choice of software architecture: The choice of platform architecture is clear from the global initiatives for development and governance regarding digital health (Principles for digital development). The selected solution should be based on open-source components , including the USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 27 database and application. It should also be cross platform o r at least function on an open-source operating system . a. Open -source system i. Builds out a community of practice ii. Allows for broad collaboration and sharing of new software features b. Proprietary system i. Requires licenses to use , which can be expensive and diffic ult to budget for ii. Has organizational support 3. Choice of specific hardware : Certain restrictions might be in place from various institutions and stakeholders involved in the process of developing a regulatory IMS (e.g., procurement from specific manufacturers might not be allowed ). RAPID FEASIBILITY ASSESSMENT Prior to adopting an d implementing a digitalized regulatory IMS , it is crucial for an NMRA to conduct a feasibility assessment of the national health IT policy and legislation for electronic transmission of information, data governance , and standards. The assessment will also investigate the NMRA's IT infrastructure and its health and regulatory personnel 's skills and technical expertise relative to their roles and responsibilities in carrying out key regulatory functions. The assessment should determine which of the MCS have been adopted and implemented by the NMRA and recommend the adoption and implementation of the remaining MCS (figure C and table 2). Objective of the Assessment The main objective of the feasibility assessment is to identify strengths, weaknesses, gaps , and challenges the NMRA faces and to inform its decision on the digital regulatory IMS selected . The assessment report will also provide practical recommendations for the gradual adoption and implementation of the digital regulatory IMS by the NMRA. Methodology Planning for a Feasibility Assessment Use the following steps as a guide when designing and executing the feasibility assessment . These steps are taken from Ensuri ng the Quality of Medicines in Resource -Limited Countries: An Operational Guide : [48] Set up an assessment team: The planning usually starts with the establishment of an independent assessment team with a defined role and scope of work. The team should consist of a team leader and two experienced professionals \u2014ideally one in health and medicine policy and regulation and the other in ICT. To reduce potential bias during the process while ensuring transparency and avoiding potential c onflict s of interest, the assessment should be carried out by a nongovernmental organization (e.g., an academic institution such as university or a private organization). It can also be performed by an international organization. It is important that the assessment, including the appointment of the team and its role and scope of work, is approved by the NMRA. This approval should be secured before any activities of the actual assessment begin. USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 28 Secure, where applicable, a financial budget based on the scop e of work and time frame described in the assessment. Communicate information about the assessment to all agencies, responsible authorities, and interested persons to enlist their support and cooperation. These usually include different units or divisions of the NMRA (e.g., MA, pharmacovigilance , market control ) and key players in pharmaceutical services (e.g., importers, wholesalers or distributors, MA holders, manufacturers). Data Collection Methods and Technique A predefined questionnaire should be us ed to guide the assessment team through collection of the data and the information required. Data collection may be carried out using a combination of techniques , including : Desk reviews of relevant and accessible (both published and unpublished) technical documents and records from primary and secondary sources , including medicines laws ; executive orders ; inspection records ; guidelines ; reports ; and economic -, health -, and medicine -related indicators. The review should also cover nati onal health IT policy, legislation for electronic transmission of health and regulatory information, data governance and standards, and the NMRA's IT infrastructure. Formal or semiformal discussions and consultations with key officials, including director s or their deputies of divisions within the NMRA, government, and other players as described earlier. To determine the feasibility of implementing a digitalized regulatory IMS , it is necessary to collect and analyze data regarding the country's health IT policy, legislation for electronic transmission of health and regulatory information, data governance and standards, and Ministry of Health and NMRA IT infrastructure . This can be used to explain the what, how, and why . Annex 1 provide s a questionnaire template to guide data collection to help determine whether adopt ing a digitalized regulatory IMS is appropriate for a particular NMRA . Every effort should be made to obtain the most up -to-date data and information. The collected data should be analyzed and visualized and presented in a report with clear recommendations . The recommendations section should prioritiz e the issues and problems to be addressed , which will help ensure the best use of limited resources . Where appropriate, a proposed stepwise process should be described for a phase -basis adoption of a regulatory IMS for the country. IMPLEMENTING A DIGITAL REGULATORY IMS PLANNING THE PROCESS Developing and implementing a digital regulatory IMS is a complex and resource -intensive process. A template (table 3) provides a recommended implementation plan structure and is adapted from the WHO computerized information management system implementatio n guideline [49]. USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 29 The implementation plan template gives recommendations on tasks to achieve , including allocating a server/hosting environment ; develop ing, deploy ing, and configur ing against reviewed SOPs ; training and data management/reporting ; and disaster recovery/maintenance planning for a digital regulatory IMS . REVIEW AND UPDATE EXISTING BUSINESS PROCESSES Throughout the process of digitalizing a regulatory IMS, it is crucial that all NMRA departments and staff work closely together, with the external users/clients, and with the software developers to define the business processes being digitalized and that a plan is made to ensure that the recommended MCS for a regulatory IMS are incorporated. The underlying regulatory functions and processes, workflows and accompanying procedures/SOPs, documents, and forms should incorporate best practices and be up to date before digitalization begins.

Once a data management strategy is in place, the full potential of data can be used to draw important ins ights. A data management strategy should be drafted from well -established best practices and proven strategies and should include both offensive and defensive components as described in the following sections. The offensive data management strategy involve s NMRA external client ( e.g., pharma ceutical compan ies, manufacturers) activities , such as MA. The goal is to increase NMRA external client satisfaction. This strategy is used to conduct data analysis and modeling or combine separate data streams into dashboards . The defensive data management strategy focuses on security and compliance. The goal is to align with regulations protecting data and privacy while detect ing and prevent ing fraudulent activit y. An effective data management strategy is built on both offense and defense , in addition to the following strategic elements : Identification of data and its meaning , structure, source , and/or location Data s torage to facilitate access, shar ing, and data processing Provision s for data packaging to allow reuse and sharing and to add rules and guidelines for data access Governance to establish, administer , and communicate the policies and processes in place for data use Processing to integrate data across systems to provide a single, unified view A data management plan should be based on the goals of the system . Both offensive and defensive components and the five core element s of data management should be incorporated into the plan . Evaluate how data are manage d and identify any shortcomings in the existing plan. If there is no plan, create a list of desired features (e.g., real-time access to data, predictive analytics, role -based dashboards ). Once you have created the list of desired features , explore data management systems in terms of their alignment with the list . Investing in one will increase data accessib ility and consisten cy. Ensuring data integrity will help guarantee the completeness, precision, accuracy, and validity of data throughout their life cycle. Ensuring data integrity involves accounting for data life cycle, including any intentional or unintentional use of data. The legal and regulatory requiremen ts for information security management systems are defined by the ISO 27000 set of standards. According to ISO/IEC 27000: 2018 (E) , \"integrity is the property of accuracy and completenes s,\" [50]. The US FDA defines data integrity as \"the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of data. Complete, consistent, and accurate data should be attributable, legible, contemporaneou sly recorded, original or a true copy, and accurate ,\" [51]. USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 33 In the context of the digitalization of a regulatory IMS , data integrity should be enforced by NMRAs to ensure the accuracy and reliability of all data associated with the regulatory processes/procedures and to assess data regarding the safety, quality , and effectiveness of medicines and health products on behalf of the public to ensure that the benefits they provide outweigh any potential risks. In the process of digitalizing a regulatory IMS , NMRAs will need to answer several questions if they want to implement meaningful and effect ive strategies to prevent and manage any data integrity risks. While this is not an exhaustive list, below are questions the US FDA recommends considering regarding data governance strategies: [51] Are controls in place to ensure that data are complete? Are activities documented at the time of performance? Are activities attributable to a specific individual? Can only authorized individuals make changes to records ? Is there a record of changes to data? Are records reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with established standards? Are data maintained securely from data creation through disposition after the record's retention period? Ensuring data integ rity of a digitalized regulatory IMS requires: Ensuring that t he data being collected are reliable and that all inputs are checked , validated , and consistent with the data dictionary Managing and controlling all user permissions and access Monitoring all updates made to the data ( e.g., data creation, storage, usage, archival, destruction) Having a system to back up and restore data Periodically p erforming and generating audit trails Training NMRA staff and other users involved in and responsible for implement ing data integrity procedures and users involved in NMRA regulatory processes TRAINING Training users on how to use a digital tool is an essential step during the deployment phase of any new or enhanced technology. Training can: Allow users to familiarize themselves with the different modules/functionalities of the digital tool Help trainer s identify some of the difficulties that users are facing and address them early and throughout the process Promote the use and benefits of the tool being deployed USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 34 A training plan improves buy-in and sets clear deadlines for training and roll out methods . While there is no one -size-fits-all approach when it comes to training on new technology (because there are a lot o f factors to consider ), the need to define a training plan is the same.f The training plan should communicate the details of the proposed training program to decision makers at NMRAs . The document should outline the objectives of the training program and identify participants . A schedule, strategies for curricula and training material development , methods for implementation, and plans for continuous improvement should also be included in the training plan. Ultimately, execution of the plan should ensure that N MRAs and other stakeholders are properly trained to perform their specific job function s. Training methods (including format, setting , and contents or scope ) will vary depending on the target audience and its specific needs. It is therefore import ant for the team drafting the training plan and associated materials to determine the most effective format for the N MRA and stakeholder communities and the best approach for delivering the training. We propose the training plan template included in Annex 2 as a starting point . This document was developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and can be adapted for training in preparation for the introduction of a new digital tool or system [53]. The template can be used in whole or in part to address specific training needs . The template should be used with the training planning checklist (Annex 3 ) to ensure that all training planning req uirements are satisfied. The template s can be used to establish a training plan to: Focus primarily on activities of greatest importan ce Have a training plan checklist for N MRA staff and other stakeholder s [52] Streamline the training process Put in place a training program that can be evaluated and r efined over time MAINTENANCE AND SUSTAINABILITY WRITTEN PROCEDURES The following procedures must be developed by the NMRA and be in place to ensure continuity of the digital regulatory IMS service provided to both NMRA internal users and external business clients \u2014the end users . The NMRA MIS team should develop and routinely update t hese procedures. Back-up plan: Will routine ly back up the system database. Using the disaster recovery plan described below , the regulat ory IMS can be restored in case of disaster (e.g., fire, flooding ). Disaster recovery plan : Describes how the above back up can be restored . The disaster recovery plan should be tested routinely to ensure it is functional. fFor guidance on developing a robust training plan, see : CDC Unified Pro cess Practices Guide - Training Planning .[52] USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 35 In addition to these documents , the following standard system documents must be available: System administrator manual on how to configure and manage the application User guide on effective use of the application Training material s, including videos, courses, and documents to assist the user to effectively use the application Database description/diagram describ ing the structure of the database for future development or reporting Developer environment description of the software development procedures and processes This will allow the NMRA to refer to the source code and apply changes as needed to update the system, assuming that the needed IT capacity is available to do this. CHECKING QUALITY OF DATA It is important to ensure the quality of data sets . Data maintenance, such as rebuilding database ind ices, is an ongoing process. The deletion of irrelevant data create s index fragmentation, which causes data gaps and slows access. Effective data man agement will help keep data clean and usable.g MONITORING AND EVALUATION The regulatory authority should implement an M&E system to monitor and evaluate the implementation and use of the digital regulatory IMS and its utility in improving regulatory performance . M&E of implementation The manager of the digital regulatory IMS should track and report to decision makers the status and results of the system's planning and implementation phases and us e of the digital regulatory IMS. M&E of regulatory IMS implementation and use will: Promote accountability and facilitate timely implementation Help guide roll -out of modules for additional regulatory functions and/or new functionality in the digital regulatory IMS Maximize use of the digital regulatory IMS Generate data that can be used to ensure sustainable support for the digital regulatory IMS To monitor performance in implementing the digital regulatory IMS , the NMRA should track the date s on which each planning and implementation activity was completed, specifically the dates for addressing each of the prerequisites (i.e., legislation, QMS, HR, financing, SRS, user requirements, hardware and software , rapid feasibility assessment) and each step in the implementation plan. Regular review of performance in implementing the roll -out will help the NMRA stay on track with the initial g Please refer to: Discrete Desk Review of Data Quality Implementation Guide, Module 2 , developed by the WHO for more information on data management best practices, including data privacy, storage, and archiving. [54] USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 36 implementation, make any necessary course correct ions, and ensure smoother implementation of new modules if the system is being introduced in stages . M&E of utility of digital regulatory IMS Sustained support for the digital regulatory IMS will depend on the system's demonstrated ability to help improv e regulatory performance. M&E of the digital regulatory IMS shoul d capture its effect on regulatory performance, including documenting how the system helped: Facilitate communications and data sharing with regulated entities Reduce data loss Reduce backlogs and turnaround times in regulatory activities Support consisten t, evidence -based regulatory actions Facilitate data and information sharing with other regulators (table 4) Table 4 - Important outcomes , methods and illustrative indicators for tracking outcomes Outcomes Examples of indicator s Improve d efficiency and quality of regulatory processes (e.g., reduc tions in data loss, errors, backlogs, turnaround times ) Regulatory activity performance metric tracking (e.g., time to find information, time to complete a regulatory activity, speed of enforcement action ) Workflow management (e.g., number of nonautomated hand offs, number of data inputs that require manual aggregation or calculation) Reporting (e.g., lag time to issue a report, number of errors in reports , gaps in reports ) Consisten t, transparent, and evidence -based regulatory actions Statistics on regulatory decisions (e.g., trends in number and nature of regulatory decisions, approvals, or rejections based on staff person, regulated entity, nonconformity/violation, and application type ) Improved communications and data and information sharing with regulated entities and other regulators Number of entities (in country and externally) with which data are exchanged electronically Number of electron ic exchanges of data Number of regulatory actions that benefited from electronic exchange of data User feedback on access to information on regulatory outcomes The NMRA should review data on these outcomes over time to understand trends. These outcome data will help make the case for continued support of a digital regulatory IMS. NMRA leadership should carefully review outcome data to inform decisions about how to improve its performance in ensuring medical product quality in the country. For example, outliers in decisions by staff or related to specific entities may identify the need for better staff training or supervision or for more consistent treatment of entities. Review of performance metrics may motivate the NMRA to emphasize new approaches (e.g., reliance) that show benefit. Review of performance in exchanging data may indicate unused potential for data sharing that will improve the quality of medicines in the country and regionally or globally. USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 37 CONCLUSION Digitalizing a regulatory IMS in LMICs is no easy feat \u2014there are context -driven considerations and planning steps that must be taken for implementation , including the size of the system, the composition of external clients , the complexity of existing data streams and systems, and the availability of human and financial resources . The adoption of the minimum common set of standards for a regulatory IMS should be a prerequisite for digitalization, as the set of standards aims to promote regulatory harmonization based on international best practices across regulatory functions. The proces s to adopt these standards and digitalize a regulatory IMS must be tailored to each country and address the specific needs of NMRAs. This document serves as a pathway to guide that process . Following a gap assessment to determine whether digitalization is feasible and appropriate , the critical steps for digitalization of a regulatory IMS include designing an intervention plan , developing an action plan , mobilizing needed resources, and implement ing the action plan . M&E is key to ensuring that all aspects of this process are on track , allowing for continuous improvement throughout . USAID PQM+ and MTaPS Programs Page | 38 REFERENCES 1.
