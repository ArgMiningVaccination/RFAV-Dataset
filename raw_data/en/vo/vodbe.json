Aromatherapy is a holistic therapeutic treatment utilizing natural plant extracts that work through the sense of smell and skin absorption to primarily affect the body's limbic system to promote health and well-being. Oils are extracted from leaves, flowers and other parts of plants and are then distilled. The resulting highly concentrated aromatic essential oils may be applied through massage using carrier oils, creams and lotions, applied to the body in the direction of the lymphatic flow to aid detoxification (a pathway directed downwards from the head, contrary to the traditional upward beauty industry motions). Alongside effective massage techniques to suit the individual, essential oils may also be utilized as a topical application to the skin using clay masks and compresses, in water immersion using bath salts or inhaled directly or indirectly using steamers, spritzers and diffusers. Aromatherapy, also known as essential oil therapy, is a derivative of herbal medicine, which is itself a subset of the biological or nature-based complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) therapies and can be considered as both an art and a science. There are over one hundred different types of essential oil and each one exhibits a unique range of therapeutic properties, uses and effects. Essential oils can be combined to create a synergistic blend of properties in order to develop specific therapeutic applications and these blends can be even more powerful in effect than when simply using an individual essential oil. As with all natural products, the power of nature's ability to re-balance our mental, emotional and physical aspects must never be underestimated. Therefore, only qualified Aromatherapists should be consulted since essential oils can be extremely potent, especially in undiluted form and thus a professional practitioner should always be consulted before inhaling them or applying them directly to the skin. Origins and History of Aromatherapy Essential oils have long been recognised for their therapeutic properties for thousands of years. Many ancient cultures such as those in Egypt, Greece, Rome, India and China incorporated aromatic plant components in resins, balms, and oils for use in therapeutic, medical, psychological, spiritual, religious, hygienic and ritualistic purposes. Ancient Egyptians used aromatic plant extracts for massage, embalming and cosmetics more than 3,000 years ago and in the Middle East more than 2,000 years ago, there is evidence of natural fragrances being used to consecrate temples, altars and priests. Aromatherapy was commonly used in Greece and in early Rome, where spas formed an important part of their culture and essential oils would be applied through massage to patrons after taking a bath. The opening up of trade routes enabled the Romans to import from Arabia and India and the use of aromatherapy moved to the Far East where the upper classes and religious centres of China and Japan made opulent use of the fragrances and introduced incense burning as part of many ceremonial aspects of their cultures. One of the mainstays of Ayurveda, a traditional Indian medicine practiced for over 3,000 years, combines massage with aromatic plant extracts and the ancient cultures of the Aztecs, Incas, Mayans, Persians and North American Indians all used aromatherapy in therapeutic ways to treat conditions ranging from headaches and congestion to anxiety, depression and chronic pain. In the 20th century, the term 'aromatherapy' first appeared in 1937 in a French book entitled Aromath\u00e9rapie: Les Huiles Essentielles, Hormones V\u00e9g\u00e9tales by Ren\u00e9-Maurice Gattefoss\u00e9 (1881-1950), a chemist and perfumer who had experienced the healing potential of treating his badly burned hand with lavender oil. The book examined the use of essential oils in treating medical conditions and undoubtedly influenced the French surgeon Jean Valnet (1920-1995) who went on to pioneer the medicinal uses of essential oils in the modern era during World War II when he used them as antiseptics in the treatment of the wounded. Conditions That Aromatherapy Can Help Alleviate Millions of people around the world use aromatherapy as part of a holistic approach to health, often employing it to complement other therapies and treatments or as a standalone therapy depending on the nature of the condition. Aromatherapy has the potential to relieve a wide variety of conditions including: Alopecia Anxiety Arthritis Asthma Back Pain Cardiovascular issues Constipation Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) Diabetes Digestion Enhance hospice and palliative care Fatigue Fibromyalgia Headaches and migraine Hormone Imbalances Immune system Inflammation Insomnia Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Kidney function Labor pain Muscle Pain Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) Post-operative pain Sinusitis Spectrum conditions Virus, bacteria and fungal infection The Aromatherapy Session Treatment duration generally lasts between 45-60 minutes. It is recommended that you have 4-6 weekly treatments initially, although aromatherapy is safe to have more frequently if desired. An initial consultation with the aromatherapist will involve a discussion about your lifestyle and condition including answering questions in order to determine an individual treatment plan to best meet your health requirements. Aromatherapy is a complementary therapy, and you are advised to consult your doctor before commencing your sessions so that the essential oils can be prepared to effectively accompany any medical care or treatment you may be receiving. During treatment, many clients experience a heightened state of relaxation and tranquility. Other common reactions to aromatherapy can include perspiration in the hands and feet, lightheadedness, increased emotional sensitivity, thirst, coughing and tiredness. Given the therapeutic nature of the treatment, it is not uncommon for the client to open up to the therapist verbally and emotionally and therefore the utmost confidentiality is a key trait that can be assured. The Benefits of Aromatherapy Aromatherapy helps to facilitate a deep state of relaxation through calming and balancing the emotional state, putting the mind at ease once more. This allows the client's natural intrinsic energy to flow unimpeded thereby bringing about the most beneficial mental, emotional and physical environment to enable the body's natural re-balancing and healing ability to flourish. Benefits from aromatherapy are cumulative and can be subtle at first. While it is possible to see immediate results after just one session, it is more likely to see notable improvements in a condition as a result of regular weekly sessions rather than sessions that are held months apart. Aromatherapy can facilitate and promote many aspects of health such as: Induce relaxation Release of tension Calming emotions Anxiety relief Alleviate depression Pain relief Deeper sleep Fatigue reduction Elevated mood Increased blood, oxygen and lymph flow Restore balance and harmony "}
