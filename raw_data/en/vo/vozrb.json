Your immune system comprises of different organs, cells, tissues, and proteins, which together perform the main body processes in order to fight against viruses, bacteria, and foreign substances. When your immune system comes in contact with any viruses, bacteria or other harmful foreign substances, it triggers an immune response, majorly in the form of inflammation. This inflammation is primarily characterized by redness, swelling, pain, heat, and loss of tissue. Since the immune system plays a pivotal role in fighting off harmful infections and diseases, it becomes important to feed it with essential vitamins and minerals in order to function optimally. So if you are looking for ways to strengthen your immune system, here are the top 5 vitamins and minerals that should be included in your diet: Vitamin A is a micronutrient that is responsible for maintaining vision, encouraging growth, and promoting proper functioning of the heart, kidneys, and lungs. Apart from this, it is also touted as the anti-inflammation vitamin that can also enhance the functioning of the immune system. Carrots, pumpkin, sweet potatoes, squash, green tea, etc. are some great choices for the consumption of vitamin A. These colourful foods not only help strengthen your immune system but can also fight various skin concerns, including acne breakouts. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin which is well-known for its role in boosting the immune system. It helps heal your wounds and promotes healthy teeth, skin, and bones. Some of the excellent sources of Vitamin C include green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale, brussels sprouts, bell peppers, sprouts, strawberries, and papaya. Vitamin E is another essential nutrient that can help boost your immune system. Being a powerful antioxidant, it helps your body in combating harmful infections while providing a clearer skin. Foods rich in Vitamin E include peanuts, almonds, hazelnuts, sunflower seeds, and spinach. A diet containing less iron can weaken your immune system and cause disorders like anemia. Therefore, it is extremely important to feed your immune system with an adequate amount of this mineral. Some of the great sources of iron include poultry, meat, legumes, seeds, nuts, cruciferous vegetables, and dried fruits. Zinc is an essential mineral that helps heal wounds, supports cell growth, and keeps your immune system and metabolism strong. Furthermore, it can also prevent your immune system from going out of control and regulate inflammation in your body. You can find zinc in lean meats, crab, oysters, yogurt, and chickpeas.
