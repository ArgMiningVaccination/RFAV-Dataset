Dampen your face and scrub the flour gently into the skin for a few moments before rinsing and drying. Follow by applying nourishing face oil or moisturizer to avoid over-drying. What we eat directly affects the health and radiance of our skin. The more foods with higher [prana](https://chopra.com/articles/7-outdoor-activities-that-boost-your-prana), or life force we can consume, the better. Prioritize eating fresh and lightly cooked vegetables and fruits for optimal digestion. Try incorporating leafy greens or vegetables in most of your daily meals. Avoid stale, frozen, or overcooked foods as it reduces the life force of the food and isn't as easily assimilated by the body. Easy to digest and high in nutrient food nourishes the body from the inside out and supports radiant skin. The liver removes and eliminates unwanted toxins so that they do not circulate through the rest of our bodies. The health of our liver is critical when it comes to skin health. If we are not adequately detoxing and metabolizing what enters our bodies, the accumulation of toxins can lead to breakouts, skin redness, inflammation, and other skin issues. Herbs are an excellent way to support the health of our liver. Kutki has a deeply cleansing action on the liver and the gallbladder, supporting healthy liver function. Other herbs like Guduchi, turmeric, and Triphala are all highly effective in cleansing and supporting the liver when taken regularly. Consult your Ayurvedic practitioner on dosage and which herbs may be right for you. *Editor's Note: The information in this article is intended for your educational use only and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
