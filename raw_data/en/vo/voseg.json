This vaccine contains a trace amount of rice protein. See section 4.3. For the full list of exc ipients, see section 6.1. 3. PHARMACEUTICAL FORM Solution f or injection The solution is a colo u rless to slightly brownish - yellow liquid. 4. CLINICAL PARTICULARS 4.1 Therapeutic indications Ervebo is indicated f or active immuni sation of individuals 1 year of age or older to protect against Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). The use of Ervebo should be in accordance with of f icial recommendations. 4.2 Posology and method of administration Ervebo should be administered by a trained healthcare worker . Posology Individuals 1 yea r of age or older: one dose (1 mL ) (see section 5.1). Booster dose The need and appropriate timing for booster dose(s) have not been established. Current available data are included in section 5.1. 3 Paediatric population The posology in children 1 to 17 years of age is the same as in adults. S af ety , immunogenicity and ef f icacy of Ervebo in children less than 1 year of age have not been established (see section s 4.8 and 5.1). Method of administration For p recautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4. For precautions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine , see section 6.6. Ervebo should be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route . The pref erred site is the deltoid area of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly. No data are available f or administrat ion via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes. Cover the vaccination injection site or any vesicles with an adequate bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact (see section s 4.4 and 5.3). The bandage may be removed when there is no visible f luid leakage. The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products. 4.3 Contraindications H ypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to rice protein listed in section 2 . 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use Traceability In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of the administered product should be clearly recorded. Hypersensitivity Close monitoring is recommended f ollowing vaccination f or the early signs of anaphylaxis or anaphylactoid reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event f ollowing t he administration of the vaccine. Duration of protection Vaccination with Ervebo may not result in protection in all vaccinees . Vaccine ef f icacy in adults has been established in the period 10 to 3 1 days af ter vaccination, however the duration of protection is not known (see section 5.1). The use of other Ebola control measures should theref ore not be interrupted . Vaccination of contacts of Ebola cases should occur as soon as possible (see section 5.1). Standard precaution s when caring f or patients with known or suspected Ebola disease Vaccination with Ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring f or patients with known or suspected Ebola disease. All healthcare workers and other ancillary p roviders who have been vaccinated should not alter their practices with regard to safe injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination.4 Healthcare workers caring f or patients with suspected or conf irmed Ebola virus should app ly extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and body fluids and contaminated surf aces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Samples taken f rom humans and animals f or investigation of Ebola inf ection should be handle d by trained staf f and processed in suitably equipped laboratories. Vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with adequate measures . Immunocompromised individuals Saf ety and ef f icacy of Ervebo have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals. I mmunocompromised individuals may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to Ervebo. As a precautionary measure, it is pref erable to avoid the use of Ervebo in individuals with known immun ocompromised conditions or receiving immunosuppressive therapy , including the f ollowing conditions: Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodef iciency, e.g. severe combined immunodef iciency, agammaglobulinemia, and AIDS symptomatic HIV i nf ection. A CD4+ T- lymphocyte count threshold f or use in asymptomatic HIV - positive individuals has not been established. Current immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroid. This does not include individuals who are receiving topical, inhaled or low - dose parenteral corticosteroids (e.g. f or asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy). Diseases of the blood such as leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms aff ecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodef iciency, unless the immune competence of the potential vaccine recipient is demonstra ted. Pregnant and breast -f eeding women As a precautionary measure, it is pref erable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy . See section 4.6. Transmission Vaccine virus might be present in biological f luids such as blood, urine , saliva , semen, vaginal f luids, aqueous humor, breast milk, f a eces, sweat, amniotic fluid, and placenta . Vaccine virus RNA has been detected by PCR in the plasma of most of the adult participants . Vaccine virus RNA was mainly detected f rom Day 1 to Day 7. Shedding of vaccine virus has been detected by PCR in urine or saliva in 19 out of 299 adult participants and in skin vesicles in 4 out of 10 adult participants . The vaccine virus RNA was detected in a skin vesicle at 12 days post- vaccination in one of the f our participants . In a Phase 1 study, vaccine viremia and v iral shedding were observed more f requent ly (28/39) in children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age compared to adults. In a subsequent Phase 2 study, 31.7% (19/60) of children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age enrolled in a shedding sub-study shed vaccine virus in saliva f ollowing vaccination. Viral shedd ing was observed more f requently on Day 7 and declined thereaf ter, with no shedding detected at Day 56. Transmission of vaccine virus through close personal contact is accepted as a theoretical possibility . Vaccine recipients should avoid close contact wi th and exposure of high - risk individuals to blood and bodily f luids f or at least 6 weeks f ollowing vaccination. High - risk individuals include: Immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see section above ), Pregnant or breast - f eeding women (see section 4.6) , Children <1 year of age .5 Individuals who develop vesicular rash af ter receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal to minimi s e the risk of possible transmission of vaccine virus throug h open vesicles. Dispose of contaminated bandages f ollowing institutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management policy. See section 5.3. Parents and caregivers of young vaccinees should observe caref ul hygiene especially when handling bodily waste and f luids f or a minimum of 6 weeks af ter vaccination. Disposable nappies can be sealed in double plastic bags and disposed of in household waste. See section 5.3. Inadve rtent transmission of vaccine virus to animals and livestock is also theoretically possible , see below . Individuals administered Ervebo should not donate blood f or at least 6 weeks post-vaccination. Transmission to animals and l ivestock Transmission of vaccine virus through close contact with livestock is accepted as a theoretical possibility. Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily f luids f or at least 6 weeks f ollowing vaccination . Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. Dispose of contaminated bandages following institutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management policy. See section 5.3. Con current illness Vaccination should be postponed in participants experiencing moderate or severe f ebrile illness. The presence of a minor inf ection should not result in deferral of vaccination. Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders The vaccine should be given with c aution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation disorder because bleeding or bruising may occur f ollowing an intramuscular administration in these individuals. Protection against f ilovirus disease The vaccine will not prevent disease cause d by Filoviruses other than Zaire Ebola virus . Impact to serological testing Following vaccination with Ervebo , individuals may test positive for Ebola glycoprotein (GP) nucleic acids, antigens , or antibodies against Ebola GP , which are targets f or certain Ebola diagnostic tests. Theref ore, diagnostic testing for Ebola should target non - GP sections of the Ebola virus. Sodium This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be ess entially sodium -f ree. 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction No interacti on studies have been perf ormed. As there are no data on co - administration of Ervebo with other vaccines, the concomitant use of Ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended .6 Immune globulin (IG), blood or plasma transf usions should not be given concomitantly with Ervebo . Administration of immune globulins, blood or plasma transf usions administered 3 months bef ore or up to 1 month af ter Ervebo administration may interf ere with the expected immune response. It is unknown whether concurrent administration of antiviral medication including interf erons could impact vaccine virus replication and ef f icacy. 4.6 Fertility, p regnancy and lactation Pregnancy There are limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) f rom the use of Ervebo in pregnant women , or women who became pregnant af ter receiving the vaccine . The saf et y of Ervebo has not been established in pregnant women. A s there are limitations to available data, including the small number of cases, caution should be exercised in drawing conclusions . Lack of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes in the af f ected regions also makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmf ul ef f ects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is pref erable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. Nevertheless considering the severity of EVD, vaccination should not be withheld when there is a clear risk of exposure to Ebola inf ection. Pregnancy should be avoid ed f or 2 months f ollow ing vaccination. Women of child - bearing potential should use an ef f ective contraceptive method . Breast -f eeding It is unknown whether the vaccine virus is secreted in human milk. A risk to the newborns/inf ants f rom breast - f eeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded. Evaluation of the vaccine virus in animal milk has not been conducted. When Ervebo is administered to f emale rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were dete cted in of f spring, likely due to acquisition of maternal antibodies via placental transf er during gestation and via lactation. See section 5.3. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast - f eeding or to abstain f rom Ervebo taking into account the benef it of breast f eeding for the child and the benef it of therapy f or the woman. In certain circumstances, where alternatives to breast -f eeding are limited, the immediate need and health benef its to the infant should be taken into consideration and balanced with the mother's need for Ervebo. Both may present compelling needs that should be considered bef ore vaccination of the mother. Fertility There are no data on f ertility eff ects in humans. Animal studies in f emale rats do not indicate harmf ul ef f ects (see section 5.3). 4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines No studies on the ef f ects of Ervebo on the ability to drive and use machines have been perf ormed. Ervebo has no or negligible inf luence on the ability to drive and use machines .74.8 Undesirable effects Summary of the saf ety prof ile For all age groups, a naphylaxis was reported very rarely (<1/10,000 ) in clinical trials. In adults 18 years of age and older, t he most common injection -site adverse reactions reported f ollowing vaccination with Ervebo were injection -site pain erythema (13.7%) . The . In general, t hese reactions were reported within 7 days af ter vaccination, were mild to moderate in intensity, and had short duration (less than 1 week). In children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age, the most common injection - site adverse reactions reported f ollowing vaccination with Ervebo were injection - site pain (41.6%), injection - site pruritus ( 4.1%), injection - site swelling (3.0%) and injection - site erythema (0.5%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were pyrexia (62.2%), headache (45.7%), somnolence and mouth ulceration (2.5%). In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days af ter vaccination and were mild to moderate in intensity. Tabulated list of adverse reactions Frequencies are reported as: Very common (1/10) , to <1/1,000), Very rare (<1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated f rom the available data) . Within each f requency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness . Individuals 1 year of age and older Table 1 shows the adverse reactions considered as being at least possibly related to vaccination and observed in recipients of Ervebo. For adults , the f requencies listed are based on the higher f requency reported in the Phase 2/3 placebo - controlled randomi s ed trials, Protocol 009, Protocol 012 and Protocol 016, that have included a total of 2,143 individuals. For children and adolescents, the f requ encies listed corresponds to those observed in Protocol 016, a Phase 2 placebo - controlled randomi s ed trial, that has included a total of 609 individuals (including 95 children f rom 1 to 3 years old, 310 children f rom 3 to 11 years old, and 204 children f ro m 12 to 17 years old) .8 Table 1: Tabulated summary of adverse reactions in individuals 1 year of age and older considered related to vaccination MedDRA - System Organ Class Adverse Reactions Frequency Children and adolescents\u00b6Adults * Immune system disorders: Anaphylactic reaction Very rare Very r are Nervous system disorders: Headache Very common Very common Dizziness Common Common Gastrointestinal disorders: Abdominal pain Very common Very common Decreased appetite Very common Very common Nausea Common Common Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders: Mouth ulceration Common Common Rash\u00a7 None Common and connective tissue disorders: Arthralgia\u00a7 Common Very common Myalgia Very common Very common Arthritis\u00a7 NA Common General disorders and administration site conditions:Pyrexia Very common Very common Somnolence Very common Very common Chills Very common Very common Crying Common NA Injection site pain Very common Very common Injection site erythema Uncommon Very common Injection site pruritus Common Common Injection site swelling Common Very common Hyperhidrosis (sweats) Common Common \u00a7 See description of selected adverse reactions. Includes: somnolence, reduced activity and f atigue. NA (not applicable): not assessed f or this population . \u00b6 The adverse reactions of abdominal pain, nausea, rash, arthralgia, chills, and hyperhidrosis occurred with a dif f erence of <5 % between vaccine and placebo groups. *The adverse reactions of dizziness and injection site pruritus occurred with a dif f erence of <5% between vaccine and placebo grou ps. Pyrexia was reported more f requently in younger children 1 to <3 years of age (83.2%), compared to children 3 to <12 years of age (64.8%), adolescents 12 to 17 years of age (48.3%) and adults (39.2%). Otherwise, the saf ety prof ile of Ervebo in children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age was generally similar to that observed in adults. Description of selected adverse reactions Arthralgia and arthritis Arthralgia was generally reported in the f irst f ew days f ollowing vaccination , was mild to moderate in intensity, and resolved within one week af ter onset . Arthritis (arthritis, joint ef f usion, joint swelling, osteoarthr itis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) was generally reported with in the f irst f ew weeks f ollowing vaccination. In clinical trials with reports of arthritis, the median onsets were between 10 and 12 days (range f rom 0 to 25 days) . Arthritis has been reporte d by participants in clinical trials at a f requency that ranged f rom 0% in several p rotocol s to 23.5% in one Phase 1 study . The majority of arthritis reactions were mild to moderate in severity. The median duration of arthritis across clinical trials in which arthritis was reported ranged f rom 2 days to 81.5 days (including duration of recurrent arthritis) with a maximum of 330 days. The reason s f or dif f erences in arthritis reporting across trials are not known but may be due to dif f erences in study populations or outcome reporting. In the Phase 1 study with the highest rate of arthritis , 6 of 24 patients (25%) who reported arth ritis af ter vaccination had persistent joint symptoms two years af ter vaccination. In a small number of participants , the vaccine virus was recovered f rom joint ef f usion samples, suggestive of . 9Rash Rash was characteri s ed in a variety of ways including generali rash In dif f erent trials, rash was reported with median onsets of 7.5 to 10.5 days (range f rom 0 to 47 days). The median durations reported were between 6 to 18 days. In 6 out of 18 participants tested , the vaccine virus was detected in rashes (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions ) suggesting a virally mediated process post- vaccination. Transient decrease in white blood cells Transient decreases in counts of lymphocyte s , neutrophil s and total white blood cell s in the f irst 3 days f ollowing vaccination have been observed very commonly in Phase 1 /2 studies ; these events generally resolved af ter the f irst week post -vaccination . No adverse events of inf ections were observed in Phase 1/2 trials. Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting suspected adverse reactions af ter authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows continued monitoring of the benef it/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare prof essionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactio ns via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V . 4.9 Overdose No cases of overdose have been reported. 5. PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine , ATC code: J07BX02 Mechanism of action Ervebo consists of a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus- based vector expressing the envelope gene of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSVG-ZEBOV -GP). Immuni sation of participants with the vaccine results in an immune response and protection f rom Zaire Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The relative contributions of innate, humoral and cell- mediated immunity to protection f rom Zaire Ebola virus are unknown. Clinical immunogenicity and ef f icacy The clinical development program included six Phase 2/3 clinical trials (Protocols 009 -012, 016 and 018). All participants received a single dose of vaccine except f or a subset of participants in Protocol 002 (n=30) and Protocol 016 (n=399) who received two doses . Clinical efficacy Clinical ef f icacy of Ervebo in adults was assessed in Protocol 010. Protocol 010 (Ring vaccination study ) wa s a Phase 3 open -label cluster -randomi s ed trial of ring vaccination (vaccinating contacts and contacts of contacts [CCCs] of index Ebola cases) which evaluate d ef f icacy and saf ety of Ervebo in Guin ea. In this trial , 9,096 participants 18 years of age who were considered CCCs of an index case with laboratory - conf irmed EVD were randomi sed to immediate (4,539 participants in 51 clusters ) or 21 days delayed ( 4,557 participants in 47 clusters ) vaccination with those 9,096 participants , 4,160 received Ervebo (2,119 participants were vaccinated in the immediate arm and 2,041 participants were vaccinated in the delayed arm ). The median age of consenting CCCs was 35 years old. The f inal primary analysis included 2,10810participants (51 clusters) vaccinated in the immediate arm and 1,429 participants (46 clusters) eligible and consented on Day 0 in the delayed arm. The f inal primary analysis was to assess ef f icacy against laboratory conf irmed EVD by comparing incidence of cases occurring 10 to 31 days post -randomi s ation f or those vaccinated in the immediate vaccination rings versus incidence of cases f or participants who consented on Day 0 in the delayed vaccination rings. Vaccine eff icacy was 100% ( unadjusted 95% CI: multiplicity: 14.4% to 100% ) (0 cases in the immediate arm ; 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed arm). Randomi s ation was sto pped af ter an interim analysis with a p=0.0036 that did not meet the pre - specif ied alpha level of 0.0027. Of the 10 cases, 7 were in contacts, and 3 in contacts -of-contacts. Uncertainties remain as to the level, duration and type of protection given the me thodological limitations and the exceptional circumstances experienced during the trial. Clinical immunogenicity No immun e correlates of protection have been def ined . Protocol 009 , named Partnership f or Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL) w as a Phase 2 randomi sed, double - blind, placebo - controlled trial which evaluated the saf ety and immunogenicity of Ebola vaccine candidates including Ervebo . This trial compared Ervebo to normal saline placebo in 1,000 adults 18 years of age in Liberia. Protocol 011 , named Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE) was a Phase 2/3 randomi sed open -label trial which evaluate d saf ety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in adults 18 years of age working in healthcare f acilities or on f rontline activities related to the Ebola response in Sierra Leone. In this trial, 8,673 adult participants were enrolled and 8,651 with valid consents randomi s ed to immediate (within 7 days of enrolment) or def erred (18 to 24 weeks af ter enrolment) vaccin ation with Ervebo . An immunogenicity sub - study included 508 participants who were vaccinated and provided samples f or the assessment of immunogenicity. Protocol 012 was a Phase 3 randomi sed, double - blind, placebo -controlled trial which evaluate d the saf et y and immunogenicity of three consistency lots and a high dose lot ( approximately f ive times higher than the dose in consistency lots and dose used in other Phase 2/3 trials) of Ervebo compared to normal saline placebo . A total of 1,197 healthy participants 18 to 65 years of age were enrolled in the US, Canada, and Spain . Protocol 016, named Partnership f or Research on Ebola VACcination (PREVAC), was a Phase 2 randomi sed, double - blind, placebo - controlled trial which evaluated the saf ety and immu nogenicity of Ervebo in participants who received: a single dose of Ervebo and normal saline placebo administered 56 days apart, or two doses of Ervebo administered 56 days apart, or two doses of normal saline placebo. In this trial, 998 children and adole scents 1 to 17 years of age and 1,004 adults 18 years of age and older were enrolled in Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone. Protocol 018 was a Phase 3 open - label trial conducted in Guinea to evaluate the saf ety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in vaccinat ed f rontline workers 18 years of age and older that was implemented as Part B of the Phase 3 ring vaccination study f or Protocol 010. In this trial, a total of 2,115 participants were enrolled and 2,016 participants were vaccinated with Ervebo. An immunoge nicity sub - study included 1,217 participants who were vaccinated and provided samples for the assessment of immunogenicity. Immunogenicity data were obtained in Protocol 009 in Liberia, Protocol 011 in Sierra Leone, Protocol 012 in the United States, Canada, and Europe, Protocol 016 in Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and Sierra Leone, and Protocol 018 in Guinea. Gamma irradiation of specimens (f rom regions involved in Ebola outbreaks) was perf ormed to reduce risk of wild - type Ebola virus inf ection of la boratory workers , but increased glycoprotein enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay (GP- ELISA ) immune responses by approximately 20% and decreased post - vaccination GP - ELISA and plaque reduction neutrali sation test ( PRNT ) immune responses by approximately 20%. Samples f r om11Protocol 012 were not gamma irradiated. Absence of gamma irradiation, lower baseline seropositivity and other f actors result ed in a higher immune response in Protocol 012. Clinical immuno genicity in adu lts 18 years of age and older Immunogenicity testing has been perf ormed in Protocol 009, Protocol 011, Protocol 012, Protocol 016 and Protocol 018 , and includes the assessment of binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) specif ic to purif ied Kikwit ZEBOV GP by validated GP- ELISA as well as validated neutrali sation of vaccine virus by a PRNT. As shown in Table s 2 and 3 , the geometric mean titres (GMT) of GP-ELISA and PRNT increased f rom pre - vaccination to post - vaccination. Over 93.8% of vaccine recipients met seroresponse criteria defined as a 2 -fold increase from baseline and 200 EU/mL at any time post - vaccination by GP - ELISA and over 80.4% of participants met seroresponse criteria defined as a 4 - f old increase f rom baseline at any time post - vaccination by PRNT . Over 80.1% of participants continued to meet the seroresponse criteria f or GP - ELISA and over 63.5% of vaccine recipients continued to meet seroresponse criteria f or PRNT at 12 months. T he clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data is currently not known.

Clinical Immunogenicity in Participants Receiving a Booster Dose Although an increase in antibody responses was observed in children and adolescents (n=195), and adults (n=194) af ter a second dose of Ervebo administered on Day 56 (Protocol 016), the increase in antibody titres was not maintained above the single dose regimen (n=386 children and adolescents, n=386 adults) at 12 months post - vaccination. 5.2 Pharmacokinet ic properties Not applicable. 5.3 Preclinical safety data Non- clinical data reveal no special hazard f or humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.14When Ervebo was administered to f emale rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in f oetuses and of f spring, likely due to trans - placental transf er during gestation and with the acquisition of maternal antibodies during lactation, respectively (s ee section 4.6 ). Ervebo administered to f emale rats had no ef on f oetal Ervebo f emale rats had no ef f ects on development or behavio u r of the of f spring. Environmental Ri sk Assessment (ERA) The vaccine virus is a Genetically Modif ied Organism (GMO). An E RA was conducted to determine the potential impact of this vaccine on human health and the environment. Because this vaccine is based on VSV, a known pathogen in livestock (e.g. horses, cattle, pigs) , the risk assessment included species that are relevant f or the wild type (wt) VSV backbone of this vaccine. In a biodistribution study conducted in non - human primates, vaccine virus RNA was detected in lymphoid organs up to 112 days post -vaccination . However, inf ectious virus was detected at Day 1 and persisten t inf ectious virus was not detected at any subsequent timepoints measured (Days 56, 8 4 and 112) . Based on transient shedding data in adults and children f rom 1 year of age (n=5 f or children f rom 1 to <3 years of age) , the results of a toxic ity study in non- human primates , and lack of horizontal transmission in pigs, t he overall risk of Ervebo to human health and the environment is considered negligible . However, as a precaution , vaccinees and caregivers should attempt to avoid exposure of lives tock to blood and bodily f luids f rom vaccinees f or at least 6 weeks f ollowing vaccination to avoid the theoretical risk of spread of the vaccine virus . For young vaccinees, if possible, soiled nappies can be cleaned with appropriate detergents or disinf ectants; disposable nappies can be sealed in double plastic bags and disposed of in household waste f or at least 6 weeks following vaccination. People who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. Cover the vaccination site or any vesicles with an adequate bandage (e.g. adhesive bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle f luid (see section 4.2). The bandage may be removed when there is no visible f luid leakage. To avoid unintended expo sure to livestock, e nsure medical waste and other cleaning materials do not come in contact with livestock. See section s 4.4 and 6.6 f or f urther inf ormation. 6.

What Ervebo is and what it is used for Ervebo is a vaccine for people who are 1 year of age and older. Ervebo is given to protect people f rom getting Ebola virus disease caused by the Zaire Ebola virus, which is a type of Ebola virus. This vaccine will not protect against the other types of Ebola virus. Because Ervebo does not contain the whole Ebola virus, it cannot give people Ebola virus disease . Your healthcare worke r may recommend receiv ing this vaccine in an emergency involving the spread of Ebola virus disease . What is Ebola? Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. If people get Ebola, it can kill them . People catch Ebola f rom people or animals who are inf ec ted with Ebola or who died f rom Ebola. People can catch Ebola f rom blood and body f luids like urine, stools , saliva, vomit , sweat, breast milk, semen and vaginal f luids of people who are inf ected with Ebola virus . People can also catch Ebola f rom things that have touched the blood or body f luids of a person or animal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact). Ebola is not spread through th e air, water or f ood. Your healthcare worker will talk to you and then together you can decide if you or your child should receive this vaccine. 2. What you need to know before you or your child receive s Ervebo Do not receive Ervebo if you: are allergic to Ervebo , rice , or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6). 26 You should not receive Ervebo if any of the above apply to you. If you ar e not sure, talk to your healthcare worker . Warnings and precautions This vaccine might not protect everyone who receives it and t he length of time you are protected f rom Ebola by Ervebo is not known. Continue to f ollow your healthcare worker 's recommendations to protect yourself f rom Ebola inf ection af ter you get this vaccine . Hand washing: Washing your hands correctly is the most ef f ective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like Ebola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread f rom person to person . Proper hand washing methods are described below ; Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body f luids. There is no need to use a ntimicrobial soaps f or washing hands . Use alcohol - based hand saniti s er when hands are not dirty. Do not use a lcohol - based hand saniti s er when hands are soiled with dirt, bloo d, or other body f luids. In an area af f ected by Ebola: While in an area af f ected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the f ollowing: Contact with blood and body f luids (such as urine, f a eces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk, semen, and vaginal f luids). Items that may have come in contact with an infected person's blood or body fluids (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment). Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died f rom E bola. Contact with ba ts, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared f rom these animals (bushmeat) or meat f rom an unknown source. Contact with semen f rom a man who had Ebola. You should f ollow safe sex practices until you know the virus is gone f rom the semen . In case of rash: If you get a rash where the skin is broken af ter receiving Ervebo, cover it until it heals.

All healthcare workers, and other ancillary providers who have been vaccinated, should not alter their practice s with regard to safe injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination. Standard precautions, as outlined by WHO, include the f ollowing: Basic hand hygiene Respiratory hygiene Use of PPE (to block splashes or other contact with inf ected materials) Saf e injection practices Saf e burial practices Healthcare workers caring f or patients with suspected or conf irmed Ebola virus should apply extra infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient's blood and bo dy f luids and contaminated surf aces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1 metre) of patients w ith E bola Virus Disease , healthcare workers should wear f ace protection (a f ace shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non -sterile long - sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile gloves for some procedures). Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken f rom humans and animals f or investigation of Ebola inf ection should be handled by trained staf f and proce ssed in suitably equipped laboratories. Vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with the following measures: Hand washing Avoid contact with blood and body f luids Saf e burial practices Saf e sex33 Avoid contact wit h bats and non - human primates or blood, f luids and raw meat prepared f rom these animals (bushmeat) or meat f rom an unknown source.
