Previous studies have revealed that complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is frequently used for, and can be potential bene\u0000cial for strengthening physical mental resilience. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the prevalence, associations and reasons for use of CAM during the \u0000rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of the Norwegian population, and determine possible effects and adverse effects of the treatments. Methods Computer assisted telephone interviews using a COVID-adapted I-CAM-Q questionnaire were conducted with 1008 randomly selected Norwegians aged 16 and above using multistage sampling during April and May 2020 applying age and sex quotas for each area. Descriptive statistics were carried out using Pearson's Chi-square test, Fisher exact test, and Independent samples T-tests to identify group differences. Results The study revealed that two thirds of the respondents (67%) had used CAM within the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in particular CAM modalities that did not involve a provider. Most used were natural remedies and dietary supplement (57%, mainly vitamins and minerals), but self-help practices like yoga and meditation were also widely used (24%). Women used CAM modalities signi\u0000cantly more than men (77% vs. 58%). Most of the respondents found the modalities they used bene\u0000cial, and 5% reported adverse effects of the treatments. Conclusions The \u0000rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not profoundly changed the overall need of Norwegian citizens to seek care outside the conventional healthcare system, but rather caused a shift in the type of CAM modalities used. The risk pro\u0000le of these modalities was generally low as only 5 % of the respondents reported adverse effects. Further studies are needed to con\u0000rm the change from provider based to self-administered CAM use. Background The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown has a profound impact on physical and mental well-being throughout the world [1]. In Norway, a nationwide lockdown was implemented on March 12, 2020 [4]. Kindergarten, schools, and universities were closed and employees who could work from home were instructed to do so. Although a lockdown most likely decreased the spread and harm from COVID-19 [2], studies describe that such restrictions might have serious mental health effects on the population [5-8], in particular inPage 3/19groups that already were vulnerable [9]. While the COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased activity for parts of health care, other parts were signi\u0000cantly reduced: Consultations and operations have been postponed due to infection control and health care providers in quarantine [3], and referral to a wide range of mental health services has decreased [1]. Health care providers working outside established health care services were instructed to close down their clinics and stop offering treatments that included physical contact between provider and client. This led to a lockdown among many complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) providers or reorganisation of their practice to telephone- and video consultations [4] where that could be of help to their clients. CAM is de\u0000ned as a group of diverse medical and health care practices and products that are not generally considered part of conventional medicine [5]. Several subcategories of health care-seeking behaviour fall under the de\u0000nition of CAM: Visits to CAM providers; use of natural remedies and dietary supplements; and different types of self-help practices [6]. CAM is widely used, ranging from 10% [7] to 76% worldwide [8]. CAM is also commonly used in Europe [7], and Scandinavia [9, 10]. In Norway a recently published study demonstrated that 62.2% of the respondents reported to have used CAM within a 12 months period [11]. Most respondents had used natural remedies and dietary supplements (47.7%), followed by self-help practices such as yoga and meditation (29.1%), and consultations with CAM providers (14.7%)[11]. A previous literature review described that CAM is frequently used to strengthen physical and mental resilience, and describe a possibly direct effect of CAM approaches like vitamin A, D, and mind-body interventions on immune functions and in\u0000uenza, relevant for people during the COVID-19 pandemic [12]. However, it is not known whether people in Norway are making use of CAM to deal with possible negative health effects of the COVID-19 related restrictions such as weight gain [21], depression, anxieties, economic pressure, and mental illness [22]. Furthermore, people access to CAM might have been limited as the CAM providers had to close down their practice during the lockdown the \u0000rst three months of the pandemic. The aim of this study was therefore to determine the prevalence, associations, and reasons for use of CAM during the \u0000rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic among a representative sample of the Norwegian population, and further determine possible effects and adverse effects of the modalities. Methods In Norway, a national cross-sectional survey was carried out between April 28 and May 5 2020 using computer-assisted telephone interviews. The survey was conducted in collaboration with the marketing research company Ipsos A/S and had a target sample of 1000 people, representing the Norwegian population of 5.4 million inhabitants [13]. The sample was strati\u0000ed by sex, age and region of residence and drawn from Norwegian residents aged 16 and above living in private households with a landline telephone or a cell phone using random quota sampling. Up to 7 attempts were made to reach the selected person. N=4,337 were unreachable after 7 calling attempts (\u0000gure 1). Individuals who werePage 4/19reached and refused participation (n=1,881) were considered non-respondents, leading to a response rate of 34.5%. The \u0000nal sample contained 1008 individuals, 487 women and 521 men (\u0000gure 1). Survey instrument A COVID-19 adapted version of the International Questionnaire to Measure Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine (I-CAM-Q) was used [11, 14] addressing COVID-19 related use in addition to use for acute illness, chronic illness, well-being and other, unspeci\u0000ed reasons. The survey consisted of three parts: The \u0000rst part related to CAM use offered by CAM providers, the second part included questions regarding use of natural remedies and dietary supplements while the third part included questions related to self-help practices such as mindfulness, yoga, and relaxation techniques. In all parts, the questions referred to use during the last three months. Demographic characteristics collected were sex, age, level of education, household income and place of residence. All data were anonymously collected and reported. Measures Measures of personal characteristics Age was obtained as an open question and assessed as a continuous variable as well as categorical after being devided into four groups; 16-24 years; 25-39; 40-59 years; and 60 year or more. Level of education was collected using six categories: 1. Primary school up to 8 years; 2. primary school up to 10 years; 3. secondary school; 4. college/university less than 4 years; and 5. college/university 4 years or more. These were merged into primary school (1-2); secondary school (3); and college/university (4-5). Household income was collected using These categories were merged into low household income (<NOK400,000), middle household income (NOK 400,000-799,000) and high household income (NOK 800,000 or more). Other personal characteristics included sex (female, male) and residence (merged into the Norwegian regions South-East, South, West, Mid (Tr\u00f8ndelag), and North). CAM providers The measure consultations with CAM providers were speci\u0000ed by visits to massage therapists, naprapaths, acupuncturists, coaches, healers, homeopaths, cupping therapists, herbalists, traditional healers, osteopaths, kinesiologists, and other CAM providers. Page 5/19The respondents were asked whether they had consulted one or more CAM providers and if yes; reasons, bene\u0000t, and possible adverse effects of the treatments. Natural remedies and dietary supplements Use of natural remedies and dietary supplements were mapped by providing the respondents with a list of remedies organized as herbs (ginger, curcumin, garlic, green tea, herbal tea, cranberry, blueberry/blueberry extract, oregano, echinacea, chaga, and other), vitamins and minerals (vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, magnesium, calcium, iron, zinc, selenium, and other vitamins and minerals), homeopathic remedies, Bach \u0000ower remedies, and dietary supplements (Omega 3, 6 or 9, protein shake, Q10, and other dietary supplements). The respondents were asked whether they had used one or more of these remedies, and if yes; reasons, bene\u0000t, and possible adverse effects of this use. Self-help practices Use of self-help practices were measured by speci\u0000c questions regarding the use of meditation, yoga, qigong, tai chi, relaxation, visualization, mindfulness, lightning process, neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), participation in traditional healing rituals, and other self-help practices. The respondents were asked if they had used these self-help practices and further; why, whether they found it to be bene\u0000cial, and if they experienced adverse effects. Over-all use of CAM Over-all-CAM use was measured by calculating the total number of CAM users reported, combining the variables modalities provided by CAM providers, natural remedies and dietary supplements, and self-help practices. Statistics Descriptive statistics were carried out using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) v. 26.0. Pearson's chi-square tests, Fisher exact tests, and T-test were performed to identify differences in sociodemographic factors (age, education level, household income) between men and women and between CAM users and non-CAM users. Results Basic characteristics of the respondents The survey consisted of slightly more men than women (51.7% vs 48.3%), with a mean age of 44.95 and 48.03 years respectively (p=0.009). The majority of respondents had high income (41.7%), a college orPage 6/19university education (53.5%) and were living in the South-Eastern part of Norway (50.7%). The men had higher income (p= 0.017) and lower education (p=0.002) compared to women (table 1). Table 1.

CAM use A total of 67.2% of the respondents had used CAM during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, more women (77.4%) than men (57.6%, p<0.001, table 2). Less than 8% of the survey respondents had consulted CAM providers (table 2). Most frequently used were natural remedies and dietary supplements (57%), followed by self-help practises (24.2%). Table 2. Use of CAM among female and male respondents during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic Consultation with CAM providers CAM providers were consulted by 7.8% of the respondents, 10.1% of the women and 5.5% of the men (p=0.011) during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic (table 2). Massage the most visited CAM providers. Most of the respondents experienced positive effect of the treatments, ranging from 91.7% (acupuncturist) to 100% (naprapaths, psychotherapists, and re\u0000exologists) mainly for chronic complaints. One had consulted a traditional healer for preventing COVID-19. Men and women consulted CAM providers to a similar degree except for massage therapists who were more frequently visited by women (4.1%) compared to men (1.9%, p=0.041, table 3). The respondents who had consulted CAM providers were mainly middle aged, with secondary education or lower university education, high income, and living in the South-Eastern part of Norway. They did not differ from respondents not consulting CAM providers in regard to these factors (table 4, p>0.217). Similar characteristics were found for both women and men apart from educational level were the women who consulted CAM providers were more likely to have college or university education (61.2%)Page 9/19compared to men (23.3%, p=0.001, table 5). Men consulting CAM providers differed in this regard from men who did not where 50.1% reported to have college or university education (p=0.007). Women, on the other hand had similar education as those who did not consult CAM providers (p=0.931). Table 3. The most commonly used CAM modalities during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, reason for use and self-perceived bene\u0000t Natural remedies and dietary supplements More than half of the respondents (57%) had used natural remedies and dietary supplements during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic (table 2), mostly reported to be bene\u0000cial, ranging from 56.4% (green tea) to 90.9% (iron). Natural remedies and dietary supplements were mainly used for well- being or other reasons, only 1.5% (n=15) used natural remedies and dietary supplements to treat or prevent COVID-19; vitamin C (n=9), vitamin D (n=4), Omega 3, 6 or 9 fatty acid (n=4), and magnesium (n=3). Vitamin D (22.6%), (16.5%), magnesium iron (4.2%), garlic (4.0%), and green tea (3.9%) were most used (table 3). Vitamin D, omega 3, 6, and 9, magnesium, iron, calcium, and herbal tea were most frequently used by women (p<0.023, table 3). Women used signi\u0000cantly more natural remedies and dietary supplements compared to men (66.7% vs. 48.0%, p<0.001). Besides from being female, the users of natural remedies and dietary supplements were older than the non-users (47.5 years vs. 45.0 years, p=0.035), and withPage 10/19higher age among the female users (48.8 compared to 45.8 years among male users, p=0.063). Education and household income were similar among users and non-users of natural remedies and dietary supplements (table 4, p>0.067), but women were more likely to have college or university education compared to the male users of natural remedies and dietary supplements (60.3% vs 45.0%, p=0.001, table 5). Neither women nor men differed from the non-users of natural remedies and dietary supplements in regard to education. Self-help practices Self-help practices were used by 24.2% (n=244) of the respondents during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority with positive effect ranging from 93.3% (yoga) to 98.7% (relaxation). The self-help practices were mainly used to improve well-being, only 3 (2 meditation/mindfulness and 1 Qigong) had used this to prevent or treat COVID-19. Twice as many women (32.4%) than men used self- help practices (16.5%, p<0.001, table 2). The most frequently used self-help practice among women was yoga (20.5%), while meditation/mindfulness (8.1%) were the most used self-help practice among men (table 3). The respondents practicing self-help practices were younger, and more likely to have a college/university education compared to those who did not partake in such practices (table 4). Women reporting self-help practices were more likely to have university education (69% vs. 53.8%, p=0.003) than women who did not. Men also, but not at a signi\u0000cant level (51.2% vs. 48%, p=0.793). Table 4. Associations for use of CAM during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic Table 5. Gender differences in associations for use of CAM during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19Page 11/19pandemic Safety of CAM Most of the respondents (95%) used CAM without experiencing adverse effects of the treatment. Five percent (n=34), however reported a total of 42 adverse effects. Four of the respondents (n=4) experienced adverse effects after consultations with CAM providers; 2 from acupuncture, 1 from traditional healing and 1 from cupping. Twenty-one (n=21) respondents reported 27 adverse effects from natural remedies and dietary supplements; 4 from garlic, 4 from iron, 4 from Omega 3,6 or 9, 2 from protein shake, 2 from magnesium, 2 from ginger, 2 from high doses of vitamin C, 2 from zinc, 1 from vitamin D, 1 from vitamin B, 1 from herbal tea, 1 from lemon, and 1 from calcium. Finally, eleven (n=11) respondents report 11 adverse effects from self-help practices: 9 from yoga, 1 from meditation, and 1 from relaxation (table 6). In 32 of the 42 cases (76.2%) adverse effects were reported even though the respondents found the modalities to be very or somewhat bene\u0000cial (table 6). Table 6. Safety and perceived utility reported by respondentsPage 12/19 Discussion The current study suggests that two out of three Norwegians (67.2%) used CAM during the \u0000rst three months of the COVID-19 pandemic. This is 5% higher than the overall CAM use (62.2 %) reported in a similar population one year earlier [11]. In particular, it appeared that the use of natural remedies and dietary supplements had increased during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the year before (57.0% versus 47.4%, respectively) [11]. These \u0000ndings are in line with a recently published study from Poland demonstrating increased consumption of dietary supplements like vitamins C and D, zinc, and omega-3 during the \u0000rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic [15]. In this Polish study, 13% of respondents started supplementation during the pandemic because they wanted to improve the immunity and/or to be protected against COVID-19 (13%)[15]. In contrast to these \u0000ndings, we found that a small proportion (1.5%) of people living in Norway used natural remedies, vitamins, minerals and dietary supplements to prevent or treat COVID-19. Therefore, the observed 10% increase in supplementation in the current study cannot solely be explained by the fact that more people in Norway were using supplements to speci\u0000cally prevent or treat COVID-19. Rather, this increased usage seems to be an expression of a wish to activelyPage 13/19contribute to increased general well-being, to boost immunity and/or activate health-promoting pathways [12]. While supplementation increased, it became apparent that self-help practices (24.2% versus 29.1%) and CAM received from providers (7.8% versus 14.2%) had decreased compared to the year before [11]. This decrease in self-help practices and consultations with CAM provider is most likely caused by restricted access to \u0000tness/yoga centers during the nationwide lockdown, and to the fact that CAM providers had to close down their clinics [4]. Altogether, it seems that the overall need of CAM use among Norwegian citizens has not profoundly changed by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a shift has occurred in the type of CAM modalities used which may signify a willingness to actively participate and contribute to one's health and wellness. If one CAM modality is not accessible, people may just choose another one. Even though consultations with CAM providers decreased by almost 50% during the \u0000rst wave of the COVID-19 lockdown [11], 7.8% of the respondents still appeared to have had consulted CAM providers during the lockdown, with good perceived effect and low risk. This \u0000nding indicates that some CAM providers managed to reorganize their practice to non-physical consultations (online/telephone consultations) [4]. Likewise, regarding the use of self-help practices, although decreased, almost a quarter of Norwegian citizens continued to use these techniques during the lockdown. Previous research has shown that practicing yoga may lower depression, anxiety, and stress, and increase general wellbeing and peace of mind during the COVID-19 lockdown [16]. Furthermore, it has been reported that mindfulness may increase well-being and provides a tool for people to deal with stressful situations such as the COVID-19 pandemic [17]. A total of 5% of the respondents reported adverse effects of the treatment. As the respondents who reported adverse effects (n=42) mostly found CAM bene\u0000cial (n=32), the adverse effects found in this study might have been minor and transient [18]. In addition, many patients who use CAM believe that healing crisis (you get worse before getting better) is a part of the healing process [19]. This together may also be part of the explanation why reported adverse effects from natural remedies are generally low[20]. According to Deng et al [21], patients who use CAM must make a judgement of risk versus bene\u0000t of a modality. If a CAM modality have solid evidence of effect together with low risk pro\u0000le, the more likely it is that patients will use the modality. On the other hand, if the risk pro\u0000le (adverse effects) is greater than the bene\u0000cial effect, then it is less likely that patients will use it. The patient must weigh the bene\u0000cial effect against risk of the modality continuously and that is what the respondents in our study seems to have done. The current study reported that women used CAM signi\u0000cantly more than men. These \u0000ndings are in line with previous studies on CAM use in Norway [11, 22] and other studies in European countries unequivocally demonstrating that CAM use is more common in women [23-27]. Limitation The main \u0000ndings should be interpreted in light of the strengths and limitations of this study. A strength was the fact that the survey was conducted in a week's time and within a crucial, lockdown period duringPage 14/19the \u0000rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Norway. Another strength was that a similar study was conducted in the same population one year before the outbreak of the pandemic [11]. However, the observed differences between CAM use during the \u0000rst wave of the pandemic and the year before should be interpreted with the knowledge that the studies used different time frame of CAM use. In the current study CAM use within the last three months was reported, whereas this was 12 months in the study conducted one year previously [11]. This might have in\u0000uenced the lower number of respondents reporting consultations with CAM providers and use of self-help practices in the current study. Another limitation of the study is that the type of adverse effects is not known. We do not know if they were mild, moderate or severe, or if it was direct or indirect adverse effects [28]. The main limitation of this study was the rather low response rate of 34.5% that might in\u0000uence the generalizability of the \u0000ndings. On the other hand, the fact that the sample used was strati\u0000ed by sex, age and region of residence increases the representativeness of the target population. The validity of self-reported data with a recall of three months can also be questioned, though the agreement between self-reported data and registered data is generally high [29]. Implication of the \u0000ndings Despite few reports of adverse effects from natural remedies and dietary supplements, the increased use of these modalities under the COVID-19 pandemic poses further challenges regarding safe use. Encouraged by social media and online marketing, people often buy natural remedies and dietary supplements online and use them without interference of a healthcare professional [30]. Main safety concerns regarding self-use of natural remedies and dietary supplements are their quality, possible interactions with other drug-related treatments [31, 32], and contamination with toxic compounds [33]. National strategies to identify, monitor, and reduce the occurrence of adverse events associated with self- use of CAM are therefore warranted. These strategies may include the development of an online registry system for the reporting of adverse events associated with CAM use in Norway [34], and to educate and inform consumers, patients and healthcare professionals about the potential risks associated with natural remedies and dietary supplements. It remains to be investigated whether the observed shift toward increased use of natural remedies and dietary supplements during the \u0000rst wave is maintained under the whole period of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extent to which these CAM modalities may support in the prevention of COVID-19 also remains to be investigated. A \u0000rst observational study has demonstrated that supplementation with probiotics, omega-3 fatty acid, multivitamin or vitamin D supplements is modest but signi\u0000cantly associated with a lower risk of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 in women, but not in men [35]. However, controlled high quality studies are needed in order to con\u0000rm these results. Conclusion The \u0000rst wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has not profoundly changed the overall need of Norwegian citizens to seek care outside the conventional healthcare system, but rather caused a shift in the type ofPage 15/19CAM modalities used. The risk pro\u0000le of these modalities was generally low as only 5 % of the respondents reported adverse effects. Further studies are needed to con\u0000rm the change from provider based to self-administered CAM use.
