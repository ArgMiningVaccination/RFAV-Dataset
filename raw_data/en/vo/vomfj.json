Our licensed acupuncturists use single-use, small, fine needles to stimulate \"acupoints\" located along energetic pathways in the body known as meridians. Acupuncture promotes Qi (vital life force) and blood flow, inhibits pain signals to the brain, and helps the body to relax deeply, resulting in symptom relief. Acupuncture is recognized by the National Institutes of Health as [safe and effective for pain.](https://www.nccih.nih.gov/health/acupuncture-in-depth) Acupuncture is a gentle and effective treatment for infants, children, adolescents, and adults undergoing cancer treatment. This integrative therapy modality can aid in preventing and alleviating treatment side effects such as pain, stress and anxiety, fatigue, and nausea and vomiting. In addition, acupuncture can be helpful as part of a comprehensive survivorship treatment program to reduce late-effects of treatment and improve survivors' quality of life. Our acupuncturists design individualized treatments for each patient or family member. We aim to get ahead of any anticipated side effects of the treatment regimen. Most acupuncture treatments are painless and playful, as we use needles with colorful handles and demonstrate on family members, creating a safe and collaborative healing environment. Acupressure stimulates the same acupoints as acupuncture, using touch and gentle pressure. Acupressure treatment may also incorporate supplementary techniques, such as acu-seeds, tuning forks, and gentle electric current, to further stimulate the acupoints. Patients and caregivers are taught how to administer acupressure at home in order to extend and maintain the therapeutic benefit beyond clinical care. Auricular Therapy Auricular Therapy is a sub-system of acupuncture and acupressure. It uses acupoints exclusively on the ear, which serves as a micro-map of the entire body. These acupoints, stimulated with needles or with pressure, can provide broad symptom relief. "}
