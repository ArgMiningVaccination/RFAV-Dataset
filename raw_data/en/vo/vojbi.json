Throughout history, tradition, culture and religion it is referred to as Life Force, Chi, Prana, Mana or divine energy. The difference: only the spelling. Our bodies are an intricate and complex manufacturing and production powerhouse. It's composed of many systems that serve very important functions. In the same fashion the chakras and the aura serve a purpose. The word Chakra derives from the Sanskrit word meaning \"wheel\". To help us put things into perspective let's use the breathing as an example. We mammals breathe in oxygen that nourishes our cells. It's distributed by an intricate circulatory system. The same system manages the retrieval of the cells byproduct, which we exhale as carbon dioxide. In this same fashion the chakras draw in an invisible source of energy from the earth, air, water, solar elements. Basically our environment. That is part of the reason why when in a toxic environment we tend to feel drained. The question asked the most (I know because I asked it many times) is: This is quackery, new age stuff, and or woo woo junk. Tell me this - is oxygen real? \"YES duh\" this was my answer :-) . Are you sure? Oxygen is not visible to the human eye, so how do we know it exist? Try this mini experiment but not while driving: Exhale...exhale....exhale...exhale... Can we as a human being survive solely on exhaling? Next: Inhale...inhale....inhale...inhale... Can we as a human being survive solely on inhaling? The answer is \"No\" to both. Oxygen like this invisible energy exists and is very real. Both measurable yet invisible to the human eye. The million dollar question you should be asking is: How do we quantify or measure this source of energy. Same as anything else study and educate yourself. Make your conclusion based off of intelligently analysis. Empty the cup of knowledge and fill it with something knew and exciting! I highly recommend the following book: The Chakras and their Functions by Master Choa Kok Sui. This book tremendously helped fill my cup after I reluctantly emptied it. Something new in uncharted territory can be scary yet empowering. Now, let's talk briefly about the aura. It serves as a protective energy field that surrounds the physical body and its components. Just picture an egg. What is the yolk and chalazae (white stuff) if not for the protective shell? Complete chaos, there would be no egg. What would our internal organs, skeletal, nervous, circulatory system be without our body's protective skins? Chaos and disarray, right? The aura is part of our energy body system. It is also referred to as the bioplasmic body, meaning a living energy body made up of invisible subtle matter. It absorbs, distributes, and energizes the whole physical body with Life Force. Here's a simple exercise that helps sensitize the chakras of the palms of your hands. Sit in a comfortable place; do not practice while driving or operating sensitive machinery. Put your palms together. As if clapping or in prayer position. Gently inhale and exhale. Visualize a bright white ball in-between your palms. Slowly move your hands apart, all while maintaining the rhythm of your gentle breathing. Visualize the white ball getting bigger and brighter by the second. Continue to slowly move your hands out. Repeat this exercise as often as you'd like. What did you feel? I'd love to hear from you! Have a question regarding this article or maybe you'd like to suggest a topic?
