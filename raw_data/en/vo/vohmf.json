The KW Community Cleanse Our 15th annual 10-day community cleanse is designed to activate your body's natural ability to heal. Detox your system and reset your energy levels with a no-starvation approach so you can start feeling your BEST going into this Spring. Some tips for the cleanse: - Do it with a friend - Plan and prepare food in advance - Adjust recipes to individual portion sizes (some are for several portions, you can refrigerate them, serve more to your family, or divide up the recipes with a friend). - Attend the online sessions for support and any 'hacks' that can make it easier to prepare and sustain the meal plan. - Pick your favourites (there is nothing wrong with eating your favourite recipes more than others, as all of them have appropriate nutrition to maximum results).
