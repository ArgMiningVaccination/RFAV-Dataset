Choosing a Remedy Understanding what to look for and how to choose a remedy can be confusing if we are trying to fit the concept of homeopathy into the paradigm of Western medical treatment, in which this drug treats that condition. Homeopathic remedies can be derived from animals, plants or minerals, and are all prepared in the same manner. They act on the body differently from how we perceive drugs to act. Symptoms in their totality represent a pattern of reaction in an individual. You might want to call it an overreaction, since it is an indicator of imbalance. Over the last 200 years, \"provings\" have been carried out to determine what pattern each remedy represents. In a proving, healthy individuals are given repeated doses of remedies to see what symptoms they elicit (temporarily). This gives us a model of the remedy's sphere of influence, so that when an individual displays these symptom patterns on their own (without the substance), we can \"cancel\" them out by matching the \"like\" remedy or substance to the overall picture. Back in Balance Homeopathy is similar to acupuncture and chiropractic in the sense that the treatments are a trigger for self-renewal. This is why I write about \"cycles\" or patterns that indicate when a certain remedy is needed. When you find a remedy that is a good match to your case, you can expect the remedy to bring the animal back into balance, first by a settling of the mind, followed by a correction, over time, of the physical symptoms that were of concern. Ledum Palustre - Marsh/Labrador Tea Use this remedy to prevent or treat bites and bite reactions from flies, mosquitoes and ticks. Animals treated with Ledum, prophylactically, receive fewer bites and react more mildly to the injected poisons from insects. This remedy reduces overall exposure to Lyme disease and is useful for treating reactions to puncture wounds. Injuries or reactions that match Ledum will feel cold to the touch. Give 30c, 2x daily for three days in the early spring, mid summer and early fall. Apis Mellifica - Honey Bee Poison This remedy is best known for the treatment of bee and wasp stings. Injuries will feel relief from cold applications and show clear signs of swelling and edema. Swellings are pink or red and feel hot to the touch. Keep this remedy on hand in a 30c potency. Give 2 - 3x in a day or until swelling resolves. (Often one dose is sufficient. Do not repeat unless necessary!)
