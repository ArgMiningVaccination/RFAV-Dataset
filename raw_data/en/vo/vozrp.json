While this confusion does play a role in one's knowledge through trial and error, people often get blinded by the real truth behind the spiritual journey. The reason this is crucial for success and prosperity is because you will be more aware of your thoughts and decision making on a daily basis. That is the key to success. It's not based on emotion, it's based on facts and logic. Staying calm and grounded in stressful situations is the difference between succeeding and making costly mistakes. This can alter your life if done in a way where you embrace the energy that feels right to you. Regardless, be open to everything and all possibilities. Spiritual Energy and Its Significance There are different forms of spiritual energy that are done through ancient exercises such as Chi Gong or Tai Chi Chuan. Some embrace it externally to then be focused within for deep levels of meditation through yoga, mindfulness, and self-awareness. Activities such as karate, boxing, and jiu jitsu use physical movements to process energy through alignment of the human body to achieve potential abilities and power. Spiritual energy is a very complex topic, as the relation to it isn't through the physical, but through the mental and intuitive. The word \"spiritual\" means \"A sense of connection to something bigger than ourselves, and it typically involves a search for meaning in life. As such, it is a universal human experience\u2014something that touches us all. People may describe a spiritual experience as sacred or transcendent or simply a deep sense of aliveness and interconnectedness.\" Letting Go There is no connection more special than the [ individual connection to your inner divine higher-self](https://myawakenedself.com/blogs/news/a-beginners-guide-to-mindfulness-and-meditation). This connection is the untold story behind creating a difference and impact in the world that you experience. There are many ways to practice letting go right now. We can let go when there is a fury of angry emotions such as when we are cut off by vehicles while driving or by someone budging in line. Let go of the negative emotion when someone receives a promotion or raise instead of you. Let go of the limited belief that we are not good enough to wake up or experience the realness of who we really are. We can let go of mantras about ourselves, about others, and even about our past lives. Create new positive energy, be yourself, and stop seeking validation.
