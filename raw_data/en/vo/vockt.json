The monovalent Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for children 6 months through 4 years of age will continue to be used for the first and second doses of the three-dose primary series. The bivalent Pfizer vaccine should be administered as the third dose in the primary series at least two months after second monovalent Pfizer dose. Labeling, dosage, and ordering It is important to carefully read the labels to differentiate between the vaccines to ensure children 6 months through 4 years of age receive the appropriate vaccine for each primary series dose. The bivalent Pfizer vaccine vial (maroon cap) is labeled \"Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, Bivalent\" with text directly under it reading \"Original and Omicron BA.4/BA.5\" and \"Age 6m to < 5y.\" There are ten 0.2mL doses per vial. The bivalent vaccine can be ordered using the same process used to [order all COVID-19 vaccines.](/covid-19/vaccinator-guidance.htm#ordering) Unauthorized uses A bivalent booster is not currently authorized for children ages 6 months through 4 years who have completed a Pfizer three-dose primary series. Mix and match use of the bivalent Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines is not currently authorized for children ages 6 months through 4 years. However, children 5 years of age who complete a monovalent Moderna COVID-19 primary series may receive either the bivalent Pfizer COVID-19 booster dose or the bivalent Moderna COVID-19 booster dose at least two months after completion of the monovalent Moderna COVID-19 primary series. Wisconsin Immunization Registry verification Vaccinators are encouraged to check the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) and/or a patient's CDC vaccination card before administering the bivalent Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines to verify that individuals are meeting the authorized uses noted previously. Resources Always check the [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Expiry Tool](https://lotexpiry.cvdvaccine.com/) to obtain the most up-to-date expiration dates for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines you have in inventory. You may also visit the [CDC's Vaccine Lot Number and Expiration Date webpage](https://vaccinecodeset.cdc.gov/LotNumber/?ACSTrackingID=USCDC_2019-DM58459&ACSTrackingLabel=IIS%20Information%20Brief%20%E2%80%93%205%2F28%2F2021&deliveryName=USCDC_2019-DM58459) and complete the registration form to request access to COVID-19 vaccine expiration dates. It is very important to ensure that the expiration dates listed in the Wisconsin Immunization Registry (WIR) are correct. Instructions for updating the [changing expiration dates in WIR](https://vimeo.com/showcase/8511959/video/669922188) start at minute 20:10. Expiration dates for maroon cap, orange cap, and gray cap vials The date printed on the Pfizer (maroon cap, orange cap, and gray cap) vaccine vials indicate the manufacture date and not the expiration date. Maroon, orange, and gray cap vials can remain in use for up to 18 months beyond the date of manufacture, if stored consistently in an ultra-low temperature freezer. The vials can be stored in the refrigerator for 10 weeks. Once vials are thawed, they should not be refrozen. Do not use the Pfizer products beyond 18 months from manufacture date. Additional information on Pfizer storage and handling may be found at [Administration Overview for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine.](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/index.html) To find the expiration date, enter the lot number found on the vial or the carton into the [Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Expiry Tool.](https://lotexpiry.cvdvaccine.com/) The date of expiration always falls on the last day of the month. Those dates must also be entered into WIR. Doses per vial and syringes for patients ages 12 years and older Per the [Pfizer emergency use authorization fact sheet for people ages 12 years and older](https://www.fda.gov/media/153713/download), one vial contains six doses of 0.3 mL after dilution. Vial labels and cartons may state that after dilution a vial contains five doses of 0.3 mL. A 5:1 ratio of low dead volume (LDV) syringes to non-LDV syringes is needed to ensure the availability of the sixth dose. The ancillary kits are supplied to support this guidance. The syringes in the ancillary kit with the one-inch needle (attached or separate) are LDV syringes and the 1.5-inch needle/syringe combination (attached or separate) are not considered LDV syringes. Given this information, providers should draw up doses from each vial using five one-inch needles/syringes and one 1.5-inch needle/syringe. Please keep in mind this guidance does not replace the need to use the correct needle size for [intramuscular (IM) injection](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/admin/downloads/IM-Injection-adult.pdf) based on the individual. If the sixth dose is not obtained, you will need to report this dose as \"wasted\" in WIR. See more information about vaccine wastage reporting on the [COVID-19: General Guidance for Vaccinators page.](/covid-19/vaccinator-guidance.htm) Bivalent gray cap Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for people 12 years of age or older is available in single-dose vials (SDVs). Vaccinators can place orders for Pfizer SDVs by completing the COVID-19 Vaccine Ordering Survey. This is the same process that is used to order all COVID-19 vaccines. SDVs shipping and ordering Pfizer SDVs are available for direct ship order only. Wisconsin vaccinators can put in orders for 50 doses. If vaccinators want less than 50 doses, they are instructed to list the extra doses they receive on the [Wisconsin COVID-19 Vaccine Exchange.](https://app.smartsheet.com/b/publish?EQBCT=102895be169146c4b69c1a9115346878) SDVs storage, handling, and vials The Pfizer SDVs have the same [storage and handling requirements](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/info-by-product/pfizer/downloads/storage-summary.pdf) as with other Pfizer tris products (store at ultra-low temperature until expiry, may refrigerate up to 10 weeks within expiry period). No ancillary supplies, including COVID-19 vaccine record cards, will be provided with this SDV product. SDVs do not require low-dead-volume syringes. The product has one dose per vial and 10 vials per carton. As noted previously, the only order quantity available for Wisconsin vaccinators at this time will be 50 doses. The cap colors and vial label borders for both the monovalent and bivalent Pfizer products are gray. It is important to read the label carefully to differentiate between the vaccine products to ensure people 12 years of age or older receive the appropriate vaccine. SDVs are intended to provide greater flexibility in vaccine distribution The rollout of Pfizer SDVs is intended to expand the number of locations that offer the bivalent booster vaccine. Vaccinators are encouraged to use SDVs at sites where they can increase access and availability of the bivalent booster vaccine. For example, SDVs could be used to expand access at doctors' offices or community health centers that have consistently low or irregular patient traffic and/or might not otherwise offer the COVID-19 vaccine. The SDVs may also encourage new sites to enroll as a COVID-19 vaccinator. Pfizer and BioNTech host medical updates and immunization site training sessions for all health care providers on the proper use of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines. - New vaccine presentations - U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals, authorizations - including recent authorizations - Extended expiry - Use of each vaccine presentation, including storage, handling, preparation, and administration - Question and answer session To access dates and links for upcoming training sessions, please visit: [https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/en-us/medical-updates](https://www.pfizermedicalinformation.com/en-us/medical-updates) Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) is licensed for individuals 12 years of age and older. On July 8, 2022, the [Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved](https://www.fda.gov/media/150386/download) a supplement submitted by BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH to the biologics license application (BLA) for Comirnaty (COVID-19 Vaccine, mRNA) to include use in adolescents 12 through 15 years of age. On August 23, 2021, [FDA granted full approval](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-covid-19-vaccine) of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for individuals 16 years of age and older. The vaccine has been known as the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine and can be marketed as COMIRNATY (koe-mir'-na-tee), for the prevention of COVID-19 disease in individuals 12 years of age and older. The decision to grant full approval is the result of rigorous review of thousands of pages of additional safety and efficacy data, as well as inspections of vaccine production sites, consistent with all other full approval processes. The vaccine also continues to be available under emergency use authorization (EUA) for individuals 6 months to 11 years of age and for the administration of a third dose in certain individuals who are immunocompromised. Vaccine name changes The COVID-19 vaccines that are currently available were contractually purchased by the U.S. Government after the FDA granted authorizations for emergency use in 2020. Companies may market their vaccines under brand names once approval is granted. No change was made to the vaccine's formula. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine label remains for individuals aged 6 months to 11 years since the vaccine is authorized but not yet approved for these age groups. For more information on the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, please visit [CDC's webpage Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine Overview and Safety](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/Pfizer-BioNTech.html) or FDA's [Comirnaty and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine webpage.](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccines) CDC COVID-19 vaccination program provider agreements Providers are responsible for adhering to all requirements outlined in the agreement. Specifically, providers must administer COVID-19 vaccines in accordance with all [program requirements and recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccination-provider-support.html) of CDC, the [Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/hcp/acip-recs/vacc-specific/covid-19.html), and the [FDA.](https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19/covid-19-vaccines) This applies to COVID-19 vaccines that have received full FDA approval and emergency use authorization. Accordingly, use of these products outside of those that have been approved and authorized by FDA (often referred to as \"off-label use\") is not recommended. It would violate the provider agreement and could expose providers to the following risks: - Administration of the product off-label may not be covered under the PREP Act or the PREP Act declaration; therefore, providers may not have immunity from claims. - Individuals who receive an off-label dose may not be eligible for compensation under the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program after a possible adverse event. - CDC has defined the scope of the CDC COVID-19 Vaccination Program in terms of how the USG-provided vaccines may be used in the program. Providers giving off-label doses would be in violation of the CDC Program provider agreement, potentially impacting their ability to remain a provider in the CDC program. - Administration fees may not be reimbursable by payers. Additional resources Controlant sunsetting Onsite temperature monitoring for Pfizer vaccines (after product acceptance) ended on November 28, 2022. [Onsitemonitoring@controlant.com](mailto:Onsitemonitoring@controlant.com)has discontinued. - Controlant dashboard has discontinued. - DDL and temperature data issues should be directed to Pfizer. All Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine shipments will continue to have supporting Controlant DDL in-transit temperature monitoring. - Vaccinators can no longer use the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine medium ULT shippers for temporary storage after receipt. - On November 24, Controlant DDLs will no longer be available for continued temporary storage temperature monitoring following the initial delivery of vaccine shipments. - All vaccinators still using Controlant DDLs for in-house temperature monitoring must install their own appropriate storage and monitoring equipment. - All vaccinators should return Controlant DDLs using the return shipping label. Temperature data must be downloaded and stored. You must keep all logs for three years per the COVID-19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement. For assistance, please reach out to [support@controlant.com.](mailto:support@controlant.com) Receiving and reporting instructions A full set of instructions and troubleshooting information can be found on the Controlant website on [receiving your single-use Controlant shipment.](https://in.controlant.com/recieving-your-controlant-shipment-pfizer-single-use) Once you open your shipper, press and hold the stop button on the logger for five seconds to stop temperature monitoring. A Quality Report should be provided via email within one to three hours. If you are experiencing network disruptions or did not receive your quality disposition report within one to three hours of pressing the stop button, this may be related to connectivity issues. In case network issues persist, go to [Controlant's Data Upload website,](https://upload.controlant.com/) and follow the guidelines below to perform a manual upload prior to returning logger. Do not use the vaccine in this shipment until you have received the quality report from Controlant advising on further use. Manual upload instructions If the temperature monitoring device is unable to connect with the cell network, please follow the steps below. These steps allow Points of Use (POUs) to ensure proper data connection through a manual data upload using your local internet network. The manual data process steps are the same for both Controlant 10.01 and/or Controlant SAGA loggers. - Connect the temperature monitoring device to a computer that has access to your local network using the USB cable provided with the temperature monitoring device. Manually upload the temperature monitoring data onto the computer. - The data file will upload onto the computer in the form of a .bin file. Once you have located the .bin file on your computer, please manually upload this file to [https://upload.controlant.com.](https://upload.controlant.com/)Manually uploading the data to this website, this allows the data from the temperature monitoring device to reach the Pfizer Control Tower which helps to ensure supply chain visibility. - Once the data is received at the Control Tower, a quality disposition report is created which documents quality considerations and identifies any suspected nonconforming items. Deactivating the old digital data loggers Many sites that receive direct shipments of COVID-19 vaccine for patients ages 12 years and older have not been properly deactivating the Digital Data Loggers (DDLs). The vaccine must be transferred into proper storage immediately and the DDLs should be deactivated once the shipping container is empty. The only way to deactivate monitoring in the old DDL is through the email you receive from Controlant. You must click the link within the email (unique to the particular device of your shipment) and click through the proper steps to deactivate monitoring. Page 9 of the [Controlant Onsite Temperature Monitoring Playbook for Sites](https://f.hubspotusercontent20.net/hubfs/4362923/OnsiteMonitoringPlaybook-Sites-v3.7.pdf?__hstc=237692383.cf99030a332da7ed8f724f10c4ea1681.1617215041860.1617215041860.1617215041860.1&__hssc=237692383.1.1617215041861&hsCtaTracking=e1cf3b55-b6a8-4ab2-97f3-dde0b76e61fc%7C534d5cfe-4d83-4b87-a340-ef489d381d15) provides step-by-step instructions for performing this task. The \"Stop Shipment\" button does not deactivate monitoring. Take this opportunity to read through the instructions linked above. Please ensure that your site is appropriately deactivating the on-site monitoring as outlined above. This process is critical to properly monitoring vaccine. If you have questions, please reach out to your [regional manager.](/covid-19/regional-managers.htm) Shipper as temporary storage for Purple Cap vaccine If an ultra-low temperature freezer is not available, the thermal container in which the Purple Cap Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine arrives may be used as temporary storage when consistently re-filled to the top of the container with dry ice. Refer to the re-icing guidelines packed in the original thermal container for instructions regarding the use of the thermal container for temporary storage. The thermal container maintains a temperature range of -90\u00baC to -60\u00baC (-130\u00baF to -76\u00baF). Storage -96\u00b0C to -60\u00b0C (-141\u00b0F to -76\u00b0F) is not considered an excursion from the recommended storage condition.
