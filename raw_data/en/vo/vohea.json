Since the start of the year most people have already experienced some sort of illness, and there is never a convenient time to get sick. Boosting the Immune System Eating a healthy and colorful diet can help support the immune system, along with supplementation of other vitamins/minerals to help fill the gaps that might be missed in the normal diet. Vitamin A, C, D, and E are all important factors to keep the immune system functioning at its top ability. We've all heard the word \"antioxidant\" and associate it with something we know we need but may not know why. Antioxidants are compounds that prevent or delay some types of cell damage by neutralizing free radicals in the body. When immune cells do not get enough antioxidants, they are unable to protect themselves and become less effective & damaged. 20% Off This Months Featured Supplements: We are offering 20% off of Immune Support, Immune Resilience, Fruits & Greens Immune Support, and Vitamin D this month in our office!

[Immune Support](https://venturechiro.nutridyn.com/immune-support) The nutrients in Immune Support are made to help support the body from free radicals and enhance immunity. Vitamin C and Zinc work together to support from free radical damage. Immunity is supported by the combination of Vitamin D, Niacin, Zinc, and Selenium. To further support healthy immune function, a proprietary blend of various extracts of mushrooms has been included in Immune Support to promote a healthy immune system. [Immune Resilience](https://venturechiro.nutridyn.com/immune-resilience-r278) Immune Resilience contains Quercetin, Ginseng, Elderberry, Resveratrol, Luteolin, Turmeric, and EGCG as its main ingredients that support a healthy immune function, respiratory health, healthy stress responses at a cellular level, healthy inflammatory markers, and promote antioxidant activity. [Vitamin D](https://venturechiro.nutridyn.com/d3-5000) Vitamin D is vital for our body to function optimally and reduce expression of disease. In our region supplementation of Vitamin D is necessary in most individuals. In the Journal of Infectious Diseases in 2010 the researchers determined Vitamin D affects cells with the help of cathelicidin. Cathelicidin is a virus-killing secretion that punctures holes in the viral and/or bacterial cell membranes assisting to destroy the invader and preventing infection. The respiratory tract is lined with immune cells that have vitamin D receptors. When Vitamin D attaches to these immune cells they can improve immunity and increase secretions of cathelicidin. There are some people that need to be cautious with Vitamin D supplementation. Vitamin D is fat soluble, and you can accumulate too much in the body if you are not careful. A Vitamin D blood test can determine specific needs. We have [Vitamin D test kits](https://venturechiro.nutridyn.com/vitamin-d-test) available in the office to ensure you are getting the right dose. [Immune Support Fruits & Greens](https://venturechiro.nutridyn.com/immune-greens) A new type of Fruits & Greens now contains the powerful immune-enhancing support of Elderberry, Quercetin, and Zinc. It's the same easy-to-mix, delicious, nutrient-dense, and antioxidant-rich superfood formula with the antioxidant power of 20+ servings of fruits and vegetables. This product is 100% whole food concentrates with pre- and probiotics, a potent fiber blend, and digestive enzymes with the added health benefits of herbal extracts and minerals to give an extra boost to your immune health. If you are looking for an easy way to give your body a little boost, without taking more supplements, this is the way to go! This comes in 2 new flavors: Passion Fruit & Mango. Eat Your Fruits & Veggies! You should be obtaining your vitamins and minerals primarily from food and not relying on only supplementation. If your diet consists primarily of junk food, high sugar and highly processed, you will be creating lowered immunity and decreased function. Seek out foods that are located around the perimeter of the store, limiting dairy and processed meats. Not all vitamins are created equal, and we cannot stress enough the importance of getting high-quality vitamins that your body can absorb. Lastly, it is important to know just because a supplement was recommended to someone you know it may not be recommended for you. It is important to always talk to a professional before taking any supplements as some may be contraindicated for you. It is also important to know if you are taking the correct dose. More does not always mean better! Let us know if you have questions about boosting your immune system. We are here at [Venture](https://venturechiro.com/) to help educate you and empower you to be your healthiest self! -Kinzie Koch, DC "}
