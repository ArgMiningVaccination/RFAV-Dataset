In our fast-paced, time constricted, anxiety driven world we are not nourishing ourselves physically and mentally, which is reflected directly with how are body functions. Many are not sleeping well, waking up in the morning and drinking copious amount of coffee and decompressing at night with a few glasses of wine. Whether we are conscious of the constant state of stress we put on ourselves, it is crucial to allow your body to rest and balance.
