The Samueli Insti- tute recently received a $2.2 millionresearch grant to study InspireHealth'sprograms as a model of patient-centredmedicine and their impact on patientempowerment, self-efficacy, sustain -ed healthful lifestyle change, and sur-vival. We all become ill at some point in our lives\u2014it is a shared human expe-rience. When the specifics of the treat-ments prescribed by our doctor fadefrom our memory, what remains areour physician's kind words of com-passion, the warm support that helpedus face our fear of the unknown, andtheir hand on our shoulder in assur-ance that everything was going to beokay\u2014these are the moments that havethe most meaning for us. Our rela-tionship with our patients is as impor-tant as the treatments we prescribe. Itis in this experience, this shared hu manexperience, where healing occurs\u2014itis broader and as important as physi-cal healing, although the two can belinked in important ways. It is thisshared human experience that bringsmeaning to our work, to the illnessexperience, and to the lives of ourpatients; an experience through whichwe support healing by empoweringand engaging patients in their health. Information alone is rarely suffi- cient to create lasting healthful life -style change. Most of us know thatexercise and eating lots of fruits andvegetables is good for us and thatsmoking is not, but only 5% of cancertant as standard cancer treatment in reducing risk of recurrence and im -proving survival. Some examples: Exercise is associated with a 20% to 50% reduction in breast cancer recur-rence and death from the disease. 1 Exercise is associated with a 50% to 60% reduction in cancer mortalityin patients with colon cancer. 2,3 In a large-scale randomized control trial, a low-fat diet combined with mo -dest weight loss was found to reducebreast cancer recurrence by 24%. 4 An RCT found that a program of health engagement (exercise, medi-tation, vegetarian diet) may affectthe progression of early, low-gradeprostate cancer. 5 Consumption of less meat, fat, re - fined grains, and sugar is associatedwith a substantial reduction (70%)in recurrence and increased survivalin patients diagnosed with coloncancer. 6 At InspireHealth, our physicians, nutritionists, exercise therapists, andcounselors guide and empower cancerpatients to integrate patient-centredhealth engagement into the excellentcancer treatment provided by the BCCancer Agency. A not-for-profit socie-ty, InspireHealth is Canada's leader inpatient-centred programs that inspire,empower, patientsin their own health. The Samueli In-stitute (www.samueliinstitute.org), aleading US health care research organ-ization, has identified InspireHealthas a leading example of patient-centred medicine and an optimal heal-Hal Gunn, MD There is growing evidence that engaging patients in simple andinexpensive ways to support their own health can have a significantimpact on outcomes in diseases suchas cardiovascular disease, diabetes,and cancer. A growing body of evi-dence suggests that engaging cancerpatients in their health (i.e., exercise,healthful nutrition, stress reduction,emotional support, etc.) can substan-tially improve quality of life, reducethe risk of recurrence, improve sur-vival, and reduce overall health carecosts. Integrated with standard cancertreatments, such programs empowerpatients to take ownership of their ownhealth and play an active role in theirtreatment while simultaneously im -proving their survival and reducingthe risk of cancer recurrence. Theresult is a higher quality of life with a reduced financial and social burdento patients, families, communities,and taxpayers. The greatest untappedresource in our health care system isour patients. Integrated with standard cancer treatment, emerging evidence suggeststhat support of health may be as impor-point \u0081counterpoint InspireHealth: Engaging cancer patients in health InspireHealth aims to engage patients in their cancer treatment with the goal of improving survival and reducing recurrence.

The ability forthe body to heal is intimately relatedto how we nourish it. Along with the evidence that healthful lifestyle changes can sub-stantially reduce the risk of recurrenceand improve survival of people withcancer (and thus, substantially reduceoverall health care costs), growingevidence exists that this integrativeapproach to supporting health duringcancer treatment has substantial ben-efits in reducing overall costs in otherimportant ways. Poorly adjusted cancerpatients consume 130% more med i calservices, including 130% more hospi-tal days, than well-adjusted patients.Even adjustedconsume 80% more medical servicesthan well-adjusted patients, includingtwice as many hospital days, as well-adjusted patients. 13 This has substantial financial im - plications, since high distress levelsare common among people living withcancer. In a recent study of over 3000cancer patients throughout Canada,37% of participants met the criteriafor significant distress. Another studyof 386 patients from 12 US medicalcentres found that 35% of patients hadpsychological distress and an evenlarger study, consisting of 4496 can-cer patients, demonstrated a 35%overall rate of significant distress. 14 Programs to support the psycholo - gical and emotional well-being of can-cer patients have been found to sub-stantially decrease the average lengthof hospital stays by 78%, decreasehospitalization frequency by 67%,and reduce emergency room visits by45%. 15The potential cost-savings achieved by such a simple inexpen-sive intervention is significant. There is a strong positive associa- tion between the number of lifestylement, as our hearts open, each of us experiences the shift that supports ourown healing. While physicians have responsi- bil i ty for treatment, we cannot takeresponsibility for someone else's heal-ing. The deeper we journey in our ownhealing, the better able we are to facil-itate healing in others\u2014not becausewe are taking responsibility for heal- ing others, but because we are taking responsibility for our own healing. Ifwe understand the paradoxical natureof our responsibility for healing, weare able to take full joyous responsi-bility for supporting our own health,happiness, and healing and release anysense of guilt or responsibility for ourpatient's healing. In so doing, we arefree to fully connect in compassion andhuman connection with our patients. Cancer patients are at substantial- ly higher risk than the general popula-tion for developing a second cancerand other illnesses including diabetes, 8 cardiovascular disease,8obesity,9and osteoporosis.10Cancer patients com- mon ly report emotional distress, fa -tigue, reduced energy, and loss ofstamina. 11The incidence and impact of many of these health conditions canbe reduced through healthful lifestylechanges, including exercise, healthfulnutrition, weight management, andsmoking cessation. Exercise andhealthful eating reduce the risk of allchronic diseases (e.g., cancer, heartdisease, diabetes, strokes, arthritis,etc.). During cancer treatment, regularmild-to-moderate exercise has beenpatients meet the minimal healthy lifestyle recommendations for health-ful diet, exercise, and smoking in spiteof the growing body of evidence ofthe importance of health engagement. 7 When we, as physicians, tell patientsabout the importance of eating health-fully, exercising, and smoking cessa-tion, it rarely has the intended long-termeffect. When we empower, engage,and inspire patients, lasting lifestylechanges can occur. A diagnosis of cancer, as challeng - ing as it is, provides a window ofopportunity for significant lifestylechange. If supported in the right way,the fear associated with a cancer diag-nosis can be transformed into inspiredengagement in health. One of the mostimportant shifts a patient can make intheir healing journey\u2014perhaps themost important shift\u2014is to releasepatterns that limit their full love andsupport of themselves. Such shiftsoccur not as a result of information(although inspiring information is ahelpful adjunct), but because of a heal-ing shift to embrace and fully supporttheir own health, happiness, and heal-ing. This is an important frontier ofmedicine\u2014to optimally engage ourpatients in their own health. At thisfrontier, we discover that the best wayto facilitate healing in others (andthus, their engagement in their health)is to engage in our own healing andmodel health and well-being. Healing is a shared experience. When we are in a compassionate rela-tionship with a patient and somethingshifts in their heart (e.g., forgivenessor acceptance), it is shifting in ours\u2014it is a mutual experience that is heal-ing for both of us. It is these momentsthat are the meaning of medicine, bring-ing meaning to our lives and to thelives of our patients. In this experi-ence, we heal as we facilitate healingin others\u2014we are not, in that moment,doctor and patient, we are co-creatorsof an experience that is healing andbeneficial to both of us.

Cancer survivors' adherence to lifestylebehavior recommendations and associa-tions with health-related quality of life:patients (i.e., stage 3B and 4) were alive 1 year after diagnosis, comparedto just 20% or 23% of patients in thestandard BC or SEER (US) survivalcurves for this disease during the same8-year time period. At 3 years afterdia gnosis, 16% of InspireHealth pa -tients with inoperable lung cancerwere still alive, compared to only 4%and 5% in the BC and SEER standardsurvival curve, respectively. Theseretrospective studies are not random-ized control trials and therefore theresults must be interpreted as an asso-ciation rather than definitive cause/effect. For example, as InspireHealthpatients are self selected, they may bemore highly motivated or distinct insome other way compared to other BCcancer patients. However, the grow-ing body of evidence in the researchliterature documenting the associationbetween healthful lifestyle and im prov -ed survival in cancer patients suggeststhat the results of these retrospectivestudies are promising. The up comingSamueli Institute prospective studywill further our understanding. With the growing body of evi- dence that health engagement playsan important role in a comprehensivecancer treatment strategy, the BC gov-ernment has provided financial sup-port for the expansion of Inspire-Health throughout BC. InspireHealthVictoria opened in October 2011, tobe followed by centres in Kelowna(September 2012), Prince George, andAbbotsford. In addition, a \"virtualInspireHealth\" has been created toprovide programs to cancer patientsand their families living in rural andremote BC communities. This vision-ary funding provided by the BC gov-ernment marks the first time in theworld that a government has providedfunding to support access to integra-tive health programs for all cancerpatients. We welcome anyone who would like to know more about InspireHealthand our programs to visit our website(www.inspirehealth.ca) or to come torecommendations being met and the quality of life of breast, prostate, col-orectal, bladder, uterine, and skin can-cer patients 7and these benefits have substantial health care cost implica-tions. Cancer patients who experiencefatigue report 50% more emergencyroom visits and 400% more visits tophysicians and clinics. 16Malnour- ished patients experience almost twicethe average length of stay in hospitalwhen compared to normally nour-ished equivalents. 17Cancer patients who receive nutritional counseling areable to maintain their energy intakeand reduce the incidence of fatigue. 18 Through simple approaches to supporthealth\u2014including healthful nutrition,exercise, and emotional and spiritualsupport\u2014the incidence and severityof these symptoms (and their associ-ated health care cost impact) can besignificantly reduced. At InspireHealth, our eight physi- cians and other health professionalson staff provide a patient-centredenvironment that helps transform thefear of a cancer diagnosis into inspiredengagement in health. Our programs,which include a 2-day LIFE program,healthful nutrition classes, exercisetherapy classes, shared learning groups,yoga, meditation, and stress reductionclasses, are all designed to empowerand engage, often in a group setting inwhich patients can inspire and learnfrom each other. Our physicians, onsalary through funding from MSP/PHSA, co-create an individualizedhealth plan with the patient designedto optimally engage health. Unpublished, non-peer reviewed retrospective studies of all Inspire-Health patients with stage 4 colon can-cer (121 patients), stage 3B and 4 lungcancer (122 patients), and stage 4 breastcancer (119 patients) treated over an8-year period at InspireHealth, foundthat attendance at InspireHealth wasassociated with significantly longersurvival compared to BC cancer reg-istry statistics.

The trend is particularly concern- ing to primary care physicians whoare frequently the targets of claims byother groups that most, if not all, oftheir job could be done by others\u2014including naturopaths. 7Introducing alternative therapies onto the primarycare landscape under the guise ofpatient-centred engagement will notenhance the effectiveness of care pro-vided by medical doctors, nor will itstrengthen their long-term position inthe medical system. Admittedly, we live in a libertari- an society where, within limits, peo-ple have the freedom to make choicesother than the most reasonable ones.This includes health care. But thatdoes not mean that governments donot have a duty to protect other rights,such as truth in advertising, and toensure that health care funds are spentwisely. It is in the spirit of consumer pro- tection and holding the government toaccount for spending tax dollars thatwe ask questions. We need to ask aboutdecisions to direct scarce public re -sources to programs that offer unprov -en therapies and that imply that pa -tients with serious diseases will livelonger as a result. We hope to get forth-right answers that address the scien-tific and ethical questions asked\u2014notlegal threats. Science should never beput under the gun. The InspireHealth website is replete with messaging about empowerment,\"healing journeys,\" engagement, andlifestyle changes. Such packaging isintuitively attractive, but it is what lieswithin the package 8that generates sci- entific concerns. Why, oncology,\" intravenous hydro-gen peroxide, homeopathic remedies,therapeutic touch, and a long list of highly dubious treatments? Moretroubling is the fact that patients incurcharges for the provision of many ofthese modalities. Further questionsworld's foremost authority on (and critic of) alternative medicine refersto the tendency of integrated medicineproponents to use the language of loveas a euphemism for the delivery ofquestionable treatments: \"They therapeutic rela-tionship, patient-centred medicine,EBM) of any type of good health care... \" 6 Physicians have long recognized that the needs of patients go beyondthe boundaries of what randomizedtrials can offer. And while doctors areexpected to deliver evidence-basedcare in a compassionate way, there areopportunities to accommodate pa tients'spiritual, philosophical, and culturalneeds in a manner that does not in -volve making medical claims that can'tbe proved. For example, many hospi-tals have a chaplain service. Often apatient's sense of hope, control, andquality of life is enriched when suchservices are available. A key part ofthe bargain, however, is that we do notplace those figures in charge of med-ical decisions. The ethical boundary isimportant if patients are to receive thebest psychological support possiblewithout compromising medical quali-ty. Arguably this line is crossed in therealm of integrative medicine. In thisrealm, therapies such as homeopathy(long debunked by the scientific com-munity) are offered to patients in acontext defended as patient-centred orholistic. But here, the purveyors areeither making medical claims or gen-erating invoices (or both). The hopegained can come at many prices: finan-cial cost, misinformation, and delay inseeking proper treatment. Compas-sionate care should also be ethicalcare. Wellness has become big business. For physicians who struggle every dayto provide quality care with limitedresources, it can be disheartening to bethe one providing real patient-centredcare and prevention only to see theHal Gunn continued from page 241 Lloyd Oppel continued from page 239counterpoint \u0081 oppel 242 BC MEDICAL JOURNAL VOL. 54 "}
