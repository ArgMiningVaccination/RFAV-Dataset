Although, it isn't just about the beaches. Nature lovers, look no further than the island of Taveuni. Taveuni is the country's third largest island, commonly referred to as the 'Garden Island' because of its lush-green jungles with an abundance of wildlife, volcanic peaks and secluded waterfalls. There are activities and experiences for everyone, so Fiji won't disappoint. From the chance to dive amongst endless beautiful coral reefs, and ample opportunities for hikers and bird-watchers, it really will be a place you'll want to return to again and again In the same way you would prepare yourself for any trip, it's important to consider the risks of disease and illness that can very quickly taint the experience of a dream tropical island holiday.
