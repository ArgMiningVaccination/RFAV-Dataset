Chiropractors specialize in the first line of treatment for musculoskeletal pain and injuries. They can diagnose your condition using the same tests as medical doctors or orthopedists. A chiropractor's goal is not to give patients drugs to mask pain, but to discover the source of the pain and correct the underlying problem. Why Choose Chiropractic Care? The spine is the structural support for the entire body. If parts of the spine become misaligned, the body cannot function properly, and pain may occur. The only way to get the misaligned areas moving again, and actually fix the underlying problem, is through chiropractic adjustments. Chiropractors do not prescribe medication or perform surgery, so you can trust that you are treating your pain without causing side effects or other potential complications. What is a Chiropractic Adjustment? An adjustment is a chiropractor's method of moving a restricted or stiff joint. Dr. French will first examine the muscles and joints in your spine to determine which ones are not moving properly. Then, he moves the joint into a certain position and applies pressure to move the joint slightly. When the joint moves, it may produce a popping or clicking sound, and it can then function the way it is supposed to. Is Chiropractic Care Safe? Adjustments are incredibly safe\u2014actually, they're one of the safest kinds of medical care available. Of course, there are possibilities of adverse effects with every medical treatment, but the risk for serious complications is much less than using [NSAIDs](http://www.bmj.com/content/357/bmj.j1909) (like Ibuprofen), [opiates](https://www.french-chiropractic.com/opiate-epidemic/) (like Norco or Morphine) and injections and surgery. Chiropractors study extensively to fully understand the body's systems. Dr French has 5 years of postgraduate training, and more than 20 years of experience. The chiropractic training program is comparable to the program of study for medical doctors. According to the American Chiropractic Association, more than 30 million people visited chiropractors last year for a variety of conditions, and an increasing number of medical doctors are referring their patients to doctors of chiropractic.
