What is 'cooling tea'? Leung cha translates literally as \"cooling tea\". An infusion of herbs originating from China's Guangdong province, it is believed to contain medicinal properties. In fact, the drink rarely contains any elements of the tea plant and is more like a bitter-tasting medicinal soup. A quick-fix remedy, leung cha is thought to cool \"internal heat\" and is used to treat a range of health problems. An affordable alternative to doctors since the late 19th century, leung cha was officially selected as part of Hong Kong's intangible cultural heritage in 2006.

Bear in mind that Hong Kong has seven months of highly humid, hot weather. One of the ways to naturally regulate body temperature is by producing sweat which cools the skin as it evaporates. However, excessive ambient humidity compromises the body's ability to cool itself and heat accumulates internally as a consequence, according to traditional thinking. \"Heat\" and \"dampness\" accumulate inside the body when too much \"heaty food\" is consumed in a humid environment. How is leung cha believed to work inside our bodies? People from Guangdong province drink leung cha for its cooling benefits to rid the body of excessive internal heat and dampness. The herb round-leaved holly is prescribed for inflammation (sore throat, mouth ulcers or sores). The herb \"heal-all\" is believed to dilate blood vessels, lower blood pressure and reduce body heat. The increase of flora in the gut can help improve digestion, and the long-term use of glutamine is thought to strengthen the immune system.
