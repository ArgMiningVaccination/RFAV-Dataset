One thing that remains constant, and that you can count on, is Herbs, Etc. We were open the entire time as an essential business during the lockdown to provide you with the supplements, remedies, tools, and education you need so that you, and the ones you care for, could remain healthy and informed. For years, in Homeopathy class, we have studied the Spanish Influenza pandemic, knowing that, historically speaking, we have been \"overdue, \" for a global outbreak of significant illness, and well, the time arrived. However, as naturopaths, we train for this; we are prepared for this. So, in this time, we want to reassure you that we will continue to be a reliable source for the items that you depend on for your everyday health as well as those things you may need to boost your immune system and uplift your spirits. We are committed to serving the community and doing our best to promote the principles of natural health in all situations. Because, Mother Nature carries on in spite of viruses, and not being able to eat in most restaurants, and regardless of what panic -stricken messages and images the media is flashing on our devices. These principles provide a guide to living with resilience, fortitude, hope, and peace. Also, if we work with her, Mother Nature, she will provide food and medicine and more to help us heal on all levels, throughout all our times. As we move forward together, remember that the one thing that negatively impacts your health and immune system the most is: stress! The remedy is to find things that bring you joy and do them every day. Shut off the devices and media, and find time to pray, keep a gratitude journal, call a friend, take a walk outside, listen to the birds sing, diffuse some essential oils, do yoga, take deep breaths, read a good book, laugh, and add to this list even more fun activities!

Fall is Kidney Season at Herbs Etc. Meet Dr. Culley -Healey, Class of 2017. 1024 N. Leroy, Fenton, MI 48430 810-569-682 hawthornviolet@gmail.com Here's her story about where she started and how far she has come as a result of her education and completion of the four- year natural health program from the Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Education I grew up in Berkley, Michigan, and graduated from the same high school from which my mother and grandmother graduated. I was lucky enough to win a full academic scholarship to Ball State University in Muncie, Indiana, spent five years getting a bachelor's degree in genetics, with minors in psychology and women's studies. During my fourth year, I spent a semester studying abroad in Sweden. While there, I met my husband, Pete, who was also an exchange student from England. We married two years later and have three children together, Oliver (19), Lilia (16), and Rosemary (12). I was a stay -at-home mom until Rosie was four, and I returned to studies at the Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Education (NITE). As a stay -at-home mom, I felt compelled to serve my community in various ways, including starting a local chapter of La Leche League, a breastfeeding support group for new moms (My mom was a leader back in the 70's/80's, too, so I'm second generation) and serving on the board of our local community garden. I really love to garden. I am happiest when amongst the flowers and herbs. Rebecca's decision to become a natural health practitioner was a gradual process. Being involved with the La Leche League was her first real exposure to lots of alternative ideas about natural health and immunity. And then, after the passing of her dad from cancer less than two months after his diagnosis, it gutted her to the core. She was dismayed not only by the loss of her dad but also, by a system she saw as ine cient, heartless, and ineective. Even if she had been able to save her dad, she was horrified by the state of our medical system and the lack of humanity that was granted to its patients. HHaawwtthhoorrnn && VViioolleett NNaattuurrooppaatthhyy Dr. Rebecca Culley continues: A few months after dad's passing, our La Leche League group hosted a guest speaker talking about herbs. During that 45 -minute talk, I knew I had found something that resonated with me in a way that nothing had in a long time, and I knew I needed to learn more. I took Dr. Sikora's Urban Herbalism course in Flint and wanted more. Dr. Sikora introduced me to the Naturopathic Institute. I think learning from Dr. Sikora before I even visited the school is what really set everything in motion. I knew before my first visit that I wanted what the school had to oer. Once I visited, I could see that it was a place that could teach me a lot. Just being there felt right. I was impressed with Herbs Etc, the products and retail store also housed within the building. It was much di erent than my local health food store. I also met Dr. Baker, the owner and founder of the school, and I could tell she had a lot to teach me in the maybe 30 seconds we interacted. Since graduating from the Institute, I have been seeing clients in Fenton. I delved into some deeper genetics work after studying with Dr. Jackie Featherly and learned how to do SWAMI, which is the Blood -type Diet, layered with genetics and epigenetics. (Epigenetics was the topic of my senior dissertation at the Institute.) My husband is a therapist with a private practice, so it made sense for us to work out of the same building. We bought our building shortly after I graduated in 2017, and we added on an addition in 2018. I opened an herbal apothecary in 2019. I love scooping out herbs and blending teas for folks. I love inviting folks to sni the jar of lavender I just opened. I love ordering new and interesting items and arranging them in the shop. I love searching out medicinal plants in the spring to sell at my shop for those who love to grow things as much as I do. But, one of the most unexpected aspects that I didn't know I'd love so much is teaching. I host many classes at my apothecary, which I think is helpful for outreach in the community. What's the point of selling 200 herbs in a community if no one knows how to use them? I love our Friday evening and Saturday morning classes, especially 4 those about herbs. I think my favorite might be taking folks on herb walks through our local Nature Preserve and helping to alleviate the green blindness our culture su ers and introducing them by name to valuable plant allies. When I first had to teach classes for homework at the Institute, my voice shook as I stood before my friends and family in my own living room! Now, I am invited to give lectures to groups including the Michigan Association of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Counselors, Union of Auto Workers Employee Assistance Program professionals, garden clubs (to talk about why they should keep their weeds and how to make them into medicine!), and others. And I love it. There were some roadblocks and challenges in getting the business started. I will be the first to own up to the fact that I am terrible at marketing and promoting myself, especially in person. I find it really di cult to walk into a place and introduce myself and leave cards. (I've done it some, but it leaves me squirming.) I have found it easier to use social media to do some of the marketing (and that works incredibly well), but I know that I really \"need\" to go shake hands with some of the Chamber of Commerce folks, and local yoga studios, and chiropractors, etc. As a result, my shop is busier than my naturopathic practice. I have received so much support from folks who come into my store and thank me for opening it. Having a place to buy high quality bulk organic herbs is rare in most any community. Many herbalists would rather make an hour drive to go pick up what they need than go through the process of ordering online. This has made for some loyal customers who are willing to travel to me. Once they get into the shop, many times they are happy to buy other things as well. I have to say that Facebook and Instagram have been a surprisingly helpful tool to help get my message out into my community. Sometimes, people come into my store for the first time but tell me they've been following me since the beginning. I also had a great support system. I was able to stick with my class, which I know not everyone is able to do. But the women I graduated with were a wonderful support group, and I enjoyed their camaraderie, their insights, and their dierent talents, which left me in awe. Some are intense intellectuals, and some have insights into emotion and energetics. Some are so talented with touch and just know how to move the body to bring comfort and healing. Some know how to work on a macro level, using formation of community for healing. I don't see them often enough today and wish I could see them more! The Naturopathic Institute provided a good liberal arts foundation for natural health, but as I was attending classes, I realized I wanted to dig a little deeper into herbology. During my junior year of the program, I decided to simultaneously take a four -season herbal intensive training course with Jim McDonald. It was one weekend a month for nine months, one day of which was spent in the classroom, and one day was spent in the field getting to know plants face to face. It was amazing. When I started school, I wanted to somehow osmotically absorb everything, and hoped when I graduated, I'd know it all. That definitely didn't happen, but I feel like I have an awareness that maybe I didn't consider before. I think I have an awareness of where my strengths lie, and that I can refer to people who have other strengths, outside of my area of focus when it seems necessary. We are taught to recognize that healing and imbalance occur not only on the physical, but also the emotional, mental, and etheric levels. If homeopathy, for example, is not my strength at this point in my studies, I have enough respect and understanding of the practice to recognize that sometimes, that might be the best modality and have some resources (be that books or other practitioners) to which to turn. In other words, we are perpetual learners in our observations of health, balance, and re -balancing. We don't have to know it all, all at once. We can have our areas of specialty and rely on other members of the natural health community for guidance. We don't have to know it all if we know how to access our resources. While in school, I experienced many 'aha' moments. Every weekend, I came home with new changes we needed to make. I discovered not all of them fit my life or made me healthier though, so eventually, I had to let some of them go. I had to learn that I should take what fits and leave the rest behind. When I started the school, I was at a natural turning point in my life. I never saw myself as a business owner or an entrepreneur before going to the school. I'm not sure what my expectations were upon enter- ing the school but being self -employed has a lot of benefits. For me, I think working for an employer could have been a bit more chafing than what I have now! 5 Dr. Culley -Healey's outlook for the future is bright: I would like to see my store continue to become more well known in my community. I'd love for herbalists within a 2 -hour radius to all know I'm here. I'm still in the stage where people are just learning about me and asking when I opened, because they weren't aware I was there. I'd also like to see a little community mecca in my area develop with people who are more herb savvy, because I've helped to shift my local culture a little bit. I'd also like to get to a place where I can a ord to hire full time sta so that I can spend the time seeing clients and have other folks run the store (at least part of the time!). I'd also like to develop more tea blends (Calmly Present and Memory Mint Medley are two popular ones), and As a new student, I wanted to know everything at once. Patiently trusting the process is di cult when you want to absorb everything at once. Setting a really solid foundation with first year classes helps create the framework that makes the more advanced classes something you can grasp. Keeping up on homework month to month is a smart way to go. Turning in last month's homework at the beginning of next month's classes is better than getting 2 months behind. Doing homework while the class is fresh in your mind is more beneficial than when you've just taken another class. I also learned that once I started charging a nominal fee for my classes, I had an easier time getting people to show up. If people invest, they turn up when they say they will. It's a nice perk. I'd also suggest following your interests. What will help you to thrive and stand out as an excellent naturopath comes only from within. If you find you are absolutely fascinated by a single aspect, dig deep into that area. Consider it the subject of the end of year dissertation. These are the things that will best serve you once you're out on your own. other herbal blends like Fire Ciders and other medicinal herbal products. I'd like to get to a place where I can formulate tinctures for clients, but that is a little more complicated with getting FDA approval for labels and manufacturers' good practices standards. I'll get there. Her decision to become a Board Certified traditional Naturopathic Doctor pushed her to becoming what she is today. On a more practical level, having that certification made it possible to become a wholesale supplier for many of the companies whose products can be sold in the store. She wouldn't have jumped into opening a store or had the knowledge base or confidence to share natural health information with her community without it. Dr. Culley -Healy's best advice to students 6 Through intensive study and research, the naturopathic team at Herbs, Etc. feels that the Covid situation was able to have such a serious impact due to all the toxins to which we are exposed and that make our bodies susceptible. It is extremely important to take steps to strengthen our immune systems and also, to reduce the toxin load that may have accumulated in our bodies. We have designed a 3 step protocol that is specific to the vulnerabilities of which bacteria and viruses take advantage. We recommend you spend one month clearing each toxin; this means that it will take 3 months to complete the Triple A Detox. This 3 month protocol will need to be repeated, for many people, a number of times. Depending on your exposure to the toxins, your environmental history, and your mineralization quality, this will determine how many times you may need to repeat the protocols. Finally, there 's (at least) one more toxin that needs to be considered. It 's glyphosate, commonly known as Round Up. Even if you eat organically, it is aggressively found in the water supply, the food supply, even organically, and the air you breathe. Therefore, in the background of the Triple A Detox, there will be a consistent effort to flush and remove the glyphosate. In Step 1, the first 30 days, we will work to remove Aluminum. It is commonly found in underarm antiperspirants, baking products, in some water sources, numerous products, and most especially, the sky trails. What are sky trails? They are a plan set forth by the government to protect us from the sun with regular, multi jet -streamed planes spraying a mix of chemicals and metals (50% aluminum) to reflect the sun's rays. This makes its way down to us, settling in our soil, water, and the air we breathe. In order to get Aluminum out, we need a few key minerals. Selenium helps with the removal of all unwanted metals, so this will be standard throughout the Triple Detox. Silica is the key mineral for displacing Aluminum from the brain tissue, other nerve tissue, cells, and general biology. We will focus on 3 remedies for the removal of Aluminum: a Nature 's Sunshine product called Heavy Metal Detox, a liquid Silica called Orgono Silica, and homeopathic Aluminum antidote. In Step 2, the second 30 days, we will focus on clearing Antimony. This toxin is heavily concentrated in plastic products. For example, all that #1 and #2 bottled water, juices, soft drinks, and numerous plastic food containers. It is also found in rubber, textiles, paints, batteries, and much more. It is a key factor in hormone disruption, weight imbalances, blood sugar problems, cancers, and other chronic diseases. For the purpose of this article, people with concentrations of this metal are more susceptible to viruses. To cleanse Antimony, consider using Nature 's Sunshine 's EnviroDetox, Herbs, Etc. 's Super Natural Boron, and homeopathic Antimony antidote. Step 3, the last 30 days, involves getting rid of Arsenic. Michigan, along with other states, has a surprising amount of Arsenic in our water. TTrriippllee AA DDeettooxx:: Aluminum Antimony Arsenic 7 Although many will be told the amount is within an \"acceptable \" range, all heavy metals are cumulative in the human body. Therefore, a small amount over a long period of time becomes a big problem. Arsenic can also be found in wood preservation, cosmetics, ciga- rettes, industrial air pollution, and our general food supply. Arsenic is naturopathically removed using Selenomethionine (the mineral Selenium and the amino acid methionine), while supporting the kidneys through a one -time per day dose of Nature 's Sunshine 's liquid Kidney Drainage and a twice daily dose of Nature 's Sunshine 's Urinary Maintenance, and homeopathic Arsenic antidote. The Selenomethionine should be considered a consistent mineral throughout the entire 90 day protocol. For those of you already taking Grand Unified, a supplement designed by Dr. Richard Olree, you 're on the right track, because it already contains Selenium and Boron, along with other good minerals. Your normal supplement program can be contin- ued while you are doing each step of the Detox. To work on the Glyphosate (RoundUp), consider Humic and Fulvic Acid liquid combination. Children do well with \u00bd dropper per day in drink- ing water, and adults do well with 1 full dropper. These naturally occurring soil acids gently move stores of glyphosate out of your body. If you suspect you have leaky gut, you may want to also add 1 tsp twice daily of liquid ION Gut Health. It heals the over permeability of the gut and brain linings. One bottle of each is enough to get your entire household started. We also have Glyphosate antidote to be taken twice per week in order to further pull out that toxin. Please keep in mind that cleansing can create unique symptoms, such as mild rashes, increased elimination, brain fog, and fatigue as the poisons leave the body. Keep up your friendly flora and good fats to make the entire process go smoothly. You can always slow the process by reducing the intensity of the program or taking small breaks as needed. Once you feel the body is clean of these metals, continue a support program that includes Silica, Boron, Iodine, Friendly Flora, Essential Fatty Acids, and Vitamins C and D3. Eat 9 fruits and vegetables per day, and find a clean source of drinking water. Our entire naturopathic staff and store staff are trained on how to implement the Triple A Detox. You are always encouraged to seek out a personalized approach to cleansing with the assistance of your natural health care provider who may even recommend a hair analysis laboratory test. Consider being diligent with these suggestions for at least the next 18 to 24 months and preferably, over a life- time for true wellness. 8 Naturopathic Community Center Classes are Free!

Jackie Featherly, a young mother of five, turned to natural medicine to help her son who suffered from a potentially life -threatening illness. She was recommended to a homeopath who she had to travel miles to see and be committed to studying homeopathic remedies for the acute conditions that her son would encounter between visits on his delicate road to recovery. This is her story. Jacqueline Featherly is the daughter of a milkman, and grew up in a family of five children in small -town Michigan. She got married at 18 years old and eventually, had five children of her own. Featherly started playing Dr. Mom when her fourth child was chronically ill. At the outset, they didn't know what his problem was; he had been on antibiotics since he was six months old for various health problems. All his baby shots were up to date for this little five -year-old. (Of course, hindsight is 20 -20.) The end result was a diagnosis of Hodgkin's Disease. The treatment of the day was chemotherapy and radiation. The doctors recommended that they take him to Florida for some sunshine over the winter and start treatment when they returned. Little Leslie became sick in Florida while they were there, and the doctors were mortified at the ongoing prescription of penicillin. They scared mom, too. They left and were determined to look for other treatments. So, it was in Riverview, Florida, that Featherly began an educational program of learning that continues to this very day. It began in a health food store with cell salts which gave remarkable results almost overnight. Then, she met a woman who told her about homeopathy. The woman graciously lent Featherly her kit and a book and told her very emphatically to \"not touch the remedies!\" With this kit in hand, Featherly began to observe symptoms and give her son remedies accordingly and was amazed at his progress. She wanted to learn more about homeopathy. So her new friend gave her the number of the National Center for Homeopathy (NCH) . Their search for a different doctor when returning home from Florida led them to Marian Belle Rood, MD, a medical doctor and homeopath. Dr. Rood, one of the great elders in American homeopathy, practiced in her rural hometown of Lapeer, Michigan, a three -hour drive from their home. Dr. Rood did not have a telephone or make appointments; patients simply showed up, waited for her to wake up and get ready, while they had picnic lunches on her porch and leafed through her many books piled in the living room, which subbed as an office. That first visit was a corker! Dr. Rood came across as quite rude and staunch. She was in her late 70's. She was quite a sight with glasses taped together, hobbling with a stick, and hair that looked like it had not been combed in a while. Leslie was afraid of her at first. Dr. Rood chastised Featherly severely for giving her son baby shots. She was rough with her, and Featherly broke into tears. Dr. Rood made up some paper remedies and gave her books to read and said she would give her a quiz (yikes) upon her return. As Featherly was leaving, another patient reassured her about Dr. Rood. Featherly cried all the way home but was a mother on a mission. She started to investigate it all and learned a lot through the homework she was doing. Featherly home -schooled her son, and within one year, he was doing well, back on his feet, and he could return to school. Soon, the rest of the family went to Dr. Rood for homeopathic treatments. Featherly learned much but thirsted for more. Dr. Rood gave her a fabulous education in the right direction. She was kind, but staunch, and of the opinion that \"this is how we do things: classical.\" Dr. Rood showed Featherly how to make remedies with powders to put into paper envelopes. She felt that if you gave bottles, people would take too much, and they could get into problems. Little Leslie grew up and never received conventional medicine or hospitalization again. After that success, Featherly pursued her studies formally and graduated from the British Institute for Homeopathy, eventually passing the Certified Classical Homeopathic exam. Certified Naturopath was next which MI 48891 (989) 427 -5046 11 really rounded out her education and qualified her to meld it together with other modalities. This led to her teaching Homeopathy III and IV at the Naturopathic Institute of Therapies and Education. She has also taught study groups for the National Center for Homeopathy since 1988. She has used homeopathic medicine and studied with world -famous homeopaths for 41 years. She delivers a wealth of information, in a systematic way, to help practitioners use homeopathic methods to combat acute and chronic problems. During the years at NITE, Dr. Featherly was also pursuing a nursing degree and developed colon cancer. She learned of Cancer Treatment Centers of America that uses complementary as well as conventional treatment. Instead of using blood transfusions, they will first try was hospitalized there, treated with both natural and some conventional medicines for three months, and cured. Currently, Dr. Featherly sees a variety of clients in Vestaburg, Michigan, which she says is \"too big!\" Another passion, alongside homeopathy, is the Blood Type Diet. Dr. Featherly has been trained and certified by Dr. Peter D'Adamo, and she encourages her clients to change their eating habits. \"Blood Type A is different from Blood Type O,\" she says. \"They need different fuel, maintenance schedules, and parts.\" She says that the Blood Type Diet compliments homeopathy, that the remedies work better and last longer, with less repetition. Jackie Featherly is hopeful about the future of homeopathy. As of late, she has been writing a book with several others as part of the NCH for grass roots America to learn homeopathy. She did learn the classical approach. And, she still remembers what her first teacher said: \"This is how we do it: classical.\" In one case, a woman came in on crutches with one purple foot that was to be amputated the following week - she had just been diagnosed with Buerger's disease. After listening to her symptoms and examin- ing her diet, Dr. Featherly eliminated some bad foods and gave homeopathic Arsenicum 200c every night for three nights before bed and had her call in on the fourth day. The woman reported having the best sleep she had had in a long time. Her foot looked pinker and could take more pressure. Dr. Featherly told the woman to wait, not take another dose, and to call in three days. By then the client was much better and went to see her doctor the day before the sched- uled amputation, which was cancelled. She still has both feet. 12 The mandates to wear face masks in public settings have been responded to with controversy and sincere questions regarding the impact they have on health, both positively and negatively. Here are some facts to consider, so that you can make the appropriate decisions for your health and the health of those around you. SARS -CoV-2, or COVID -19, is a beta -coronavirus with a diameter between 60 nanometers (nm) and 140 nm, or 0.06 to 0.14 microns (micrometers). This is about half the size of most viruses, which tend to measure between 0.02 microns to 0.3 microns. Virus -laden saliva or respiratory droplets expelled when talking or coughing measure between 5 and 10 microns, far larger than the coronavirus, and it is these droplets that surgical masks and respirators can block. For example, N95 masks can filter particles as small as 0.3 microns, though they cannot block aerosolized viruses that are in the air itself. Additionally, most N95 masks only protect the wearer, because they have exhalation ports that allow the unfiltered air to be exhaled out. 3M surgical masks can block up to 75% of particles measuring between 0.02 microns and 1 micron, while cloth masks only block between 30% and 60% of respiratory particles of this same size. For prevention against respiratory particles, the real efficacy of a mask also depends on what type of mask it is, in what type of environment it is worn, how it is worn, if it remains untouched the entire time it is worn, and how often it is changed. In fact, the WHO's guidance memo states: \"At present, there is no direct evidence (from studies on COVID - 19 and in healthy people in the community) on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including COVID -19.\" SARS -CoV-2 is an aerosolized virus, meaning its tiny particles float in the air, and the research shows that face masks of any kind do little to prevent against If the pores and gaps of the mask are larger than the virus, it cannot block the virus from entering or escaping the mask. And, influenza viruses, coronaviruses that cause the common cold and COVID -19, all spread via the air, not just by way of respiratory droplets or touching contaminated surfaces. Therefore, it's important to realize that preventing droplet contamination does not mean transmission of the aerosolized virus is being prevented. To block aerosolized viruses, you would need a mask that prevents all air flow, and that, of course, wouldn't work, since air flow and oxygen is a requirement for life. A policy review paper published in Emerging Infectious Diseases in May 2020, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's own journal, also reviewed the evidence on the effectiveness of non -pharmaceutical personal protective measures in non -healthcare settings, and they, too, found no evidence of benefit: \" Although mechanistic studies support the potential effect of hand hygiene or face masks, evidence from 14 randomized controlled trials of these measures did not support a substantial effect on transmission of laboratory - confirmed influenza.\" In summary on face masks, they wrote: \" There is limited evidence for their effectiveness in preventing influenza virus transmission either when worn by the infected person for source control or when worn by uninfected persons to reduce exposure.\" Studies have also found that wearing a face mask can, itself, create significant health problems. These issues vary and can include headaches, facial skin lesions, irritant dermatitis, worsening acne, worsening asthma, increased airway resistance, low oxygen levels, carbon dioxide accumulation, and serious life -threatening complications. A majority of the evidence points toward hypoxia and/or hypercapnia as the cause. Hypoxia is a reduction in blood oxygenation, and hypercapnia is an elevation in blood carbon dioxide (CO2). Hypoxia is noted as a significant factor in atherosclerosis and for increasing inflammation and the risk for Heart Attack and Unmasking the Myths By Amy Jo Howard, ND, CH 13 References: StatPearls July 4, 2020, Etiology \u2014 Sufficient Protection for COVID -19?

Going for a walk outside can improve your oxygen supply and help clear the lungs of unwanted gases and particles. Now is the time to eat healthier than ever before, like increasing organic berries and fruits to improve antioxidants that protects cells from damage. Carbon Dioxide is hard on the kidneys so extra water intake is necessary to flush the kidneys . Stroke. Furthermore, the frail elderly and those with cancer and lung diseases are at risk of causing a severe worsening of lung function and the spread and growth of cancer. The importance of these findings is that a drop in oxygen levels is associated with an impairment in immunity. Hypoxia can inhibit the type of main immune cells used to fight viral infections. This occurs, because hypoxia increases the level of a compound which inhibits T -lymphocytes and stimulates a powerful immune inhibitor cell. This sets the stage for contracting any infection, including COVID -19, and making the consequences of that infection more severe. In essence, wearing a face mask is likely to increase the risk of infection and create a much worse outcome with that infection . Also, wearing face masks daily, especially for several hours at a time, produces additional concerns. When a person is infected with a respiratory virus, they expel some of the virus with each breath. If that person is wearing a mask, especially an N95 or other tight -fitting mask, they are constantly re -breathing the viruses, and this raises the concentration of the virus in the lungs and the nasal passages. People who have the worst reactions to the coronavirus have the highest concentrations of the virus early on. This, then, leads to the deadly cytokine storm. Newer evidence even suggests that in some cases, the virus can enter the brain. It does this by way of the olfactory nerves (smell), which connect directly with the area of the brain dealing with recent memory and memory consolidation. By wearing a mask, the exhaled viruses will not be able to escape and will concentrate in the nasal passages, enter the olfactory nerves, and travel into the brain. In all, it's interesting to note that the organizations guiding our health systems are continually changing their advice, although their own science has not changed. Most people want to do what they believe is right and what they believe will save lives. If you carefully evaluate the evidence, it becomes apparent that these mandates are quite questionable in their regard for health, and that if we truly want to protect each other, we will teach one another about how to live healthy and boost our immune systems, and then, just generally, remember to act and speak with care for everyone. 14 Dear Friends, can we offer some help about the enhanced feelings you may be having this year? We have all certainly had our moments of hope, frustration, sadness, disbelief, anger, fear, uncertainty, and so much more. The work of Candice Pert, PhD, a research scientist and rather brilliant lady recognized for her contribution to science and the study of emotions, once wrote that feelings are not good or bad, positive or negative, right or wrong. She did, however, explain in her book Molecules of Emotion that unexpressed feelings are what can lead to Dis -ease. It currently feels like an intense array of emotions are going through us daily. For us at Herbs Etc., focusing on grace and compassion are most necessary in having a calm and fruitful day. My observation is that we have very specific expectations of how we would like others to handle their emotions. The art of compassion and gracefulness comes when we can realize that the majority of people truly are doing their highest and best level of emotional expression! Especially when we consider where each of us are in our development. Therefore, hooray for us as human beings! My favorite tool for my own growth work or teaching others is to use the consciousness scale developed by David Hawkins, PhD, and offered in his book Power vs. Force . When using his scale below, it allows us to see our own stages of development, and depending \u00a9 on what type of situation we were born into, we may have a short or long way to go before we can find peace in our own and others ability to handle the current massive planetary changes! I often say, \"We are living in the greatest time in human history! \" What do I mean by that? ....That will be translated by where you honestly are on this scale. The bottom line is to recognize that if someone 's consciousness cannot help but be angry, fearful, even down right hostile, then that still may be higher than where they first started! Yes, anger is better than apathy, because at least now, you are taking action! Pride is a climb up from fear, because you are more likely to be helping others! If you will just consider that everyone is truly doing their best and understand that their best may be different than yours, then we are off to healing this planet and its current and past challenges! My hope is that we can all work to be in a state of courage because every person in that state can help others who are unable to experience courage at this time. Seek to participate with words or actions that unite, take the stand that matches your consciousness calibration, and recognize that others are doing the same, just at their own level. If we keep dividing, we certainly can not stand! Recognize honestly where you are on this scale, and sometimes, that is enough to want to move to the next level towards ultimate peace.
