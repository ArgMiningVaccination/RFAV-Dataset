As I built on these treatments I started to see deeper shifts , physically, emotionally and even spiritually, I noticed I was more centered and had a deeper sense of awareness. I felt I had cleared some baggage and I actually left it behind. Things started to shift in my life without me actually having to actively do or chase, opportunity would just arise and I believe it was because of something inside me had changed and that was reflecting in my outer world. I highly recommend working with these 2 , and definitely doing at least few sessions and you will feel the difference.

I've been doing this type of breathwork for 15 years and her classes are the most transformational and sweet breath classes I've experienced. I go regularly to release stress and heal whatever emotional gunk is coming up to be cleared. My husband usually goes with me as well. He also loves the results of her breath classes.

Dec 2018 Solo A close friend recently took Dr. Bella's Transformational Breath class and suggested I attend one as well. She loved it and said it was like nothing she had ever experienced. We are both on our separate wellness journeys and felt this was something I needed to try. Dealing with my own illness and recently becoming a caregiver to a family member my typical emotional defenses were firing at an all time high. Traditional talk therapy and even yoga have done little to break them down and I was fearing my tough exterior was reaching a cracking point. Needing to be emotionally healthy for my family member, the transformational breath class had me vibrating everywhere but particularly where my family member is ill. Now knowing how to breathe will help me and I can't wait to take another class with Dr. Bella when I return to FL!

Dear Michele, thank you for sharing your experience here with me and others. Wow, the power of the breath always moves me. Every time is different. It is as if your breath knows exactly what you need at the time. Yes I too look forward to breathing with you again very soon! Looking forward to your next visit to Florida!!! All of my love and gratitude to you. Dr Bella Written March 12, 2019 This response is the subjective opinion of the management representative and not of Tripadvisor LLC. Sep 2018 Solo I went to Dr Bella prior to having an elective surgery. She educated me on the interaction of the body as a whole unit as opposed to specific and separate parts. I was given a loving concept of my self and how to treat my body...She called me & treated me like a \"Queen\". I left our session with a brand new concept of taking care of myself. This new information makes so much sense ----its a logical approach!! Written September 16, 2018 This review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.
