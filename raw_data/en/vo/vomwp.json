Individuals should get their second dose in the primary series 8 weeks after receiving their first dose. Booster doses of the COVID-19 vaccine are recommended for individuals 5 years of age and older, 6 months after their last dose of their primary series vaccine. All eligible islanders are recommended to receive one dose of bivalent vaccine if the 6 month interval has been met since their last booster dose. NACI further recommends an additional COVID-19 booster dose* for individuals at high risk of severe illness due to COVID-19. Individuals who are not at risk of severe illness due to COVID-19 who have received a bivalent booster as their last dose do not require any further doses of vaccine at this time. *Since October 2022, NACI has recommended that bivalent Omicron-containing mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are the preferred booster product. One booster dose of the COVID-19 vaccine is recommended after the primary series for children 5-11 years of age at least 6 months after their last dose of the vaccine. Children 5 to 11 years of age who are moderately to severely immunocompromised and have already received a booster dose with an original COVID-19 mRNA vaccine could be offered an Omicron-containing bivalent booster dose as per the recommended 6 month interval. Important Notice: Islanders infected with COVID-19 should wait 3 months after onset of symptoms or a positive test before getting a COVID-19 vaccine (primary series or booster dose) provided they are eligible for vaccination based on the recommended time between doses.
