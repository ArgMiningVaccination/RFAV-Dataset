While still a medical student, Jenner learned about rural English farm workers' and physicians' observations that people who had contracted a disease called cowpox, which caused blistering on cow's udders, often did not catch smallpox. Unlike smallpox, which caused severe skin eruptions and dangerous fevers in humans, cowpox led to few ill symptoms in these women.

In the 19th and 20th centuries, scientists following Jenner's model developed new vaccines to fight [numerous deadly diseases](https://www.history.com/topics/middle-ages/pandemics-timeline), including polio, whooping cough, measles, tetanus, yellow fever, typhus, and hepatitis B and many others. More sophisticated smallpox vaccines were also developed and by 1970 international vaccination programs, such as those undertaken by the World Health Organization, had "}
