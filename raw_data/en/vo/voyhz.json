According to Lonny S. Jarrett (Nourishing Destiny), Metal occurs in the body as the minerals that nourish us and give strength to our bones and tissues. In addition to its physical characteristics, Metal also has more subtle qualities. To assess these subtle qualities of our Metal element we can ask ourselves: does our fixed view of reality make us indifferent towards others? Do we cultivate self-worth? Are we like a radiant diamond that inspires others? The organs associated with the Metal element are the Lungs and the Large Intestine. The Lungs are the yin organ, govern qi (energy) and control breathing. They regulate water passages and moisture, and control skin and body hair. While the Lungs keep impurity out of our body and are associated with a very subtle form of energy (air), Large Intestine lets go of impurities retaining what is of value for the body (minerals, a more substantial form of qi). From a psycho-spiritual point of view it talks to us of our inner journey to self-worth. TCM, for example, recognizes the importance of the synchronization between the rhythm of the Lungs and the Heart in empowering our connection to life and our ability to be present; something that has been explored by anthroposophist Rudolph Steiner as well. In Anthroposophy it is well recognized that both pulse and breathing are an expression of the harmony in the human being who is at one with himself (H. Koepke, Encountering the self). The ninth year of a child's life is called in fact \"the crossing\", when outwardly harmony between heartbeat and breathing is established; inwardly children start experiencing themselves as something separate from the world. This is an essential step in the inner growth of children as independent and balanced human beings. Lungs are linked to the emotion of grief; tears are a flow of energy and a way to physically release toxins. The lesson to learn when working with Lungs is to know what to value. If we are not clear on what has value in our life, if we always feel uncertain on the course of action to take, we cannot nourish ourselves and learn from life's opportunities. We can ask ourselves: do we find flaws in everything? Do we habitually talk down to everyone? The Large Intestine, the yang organ of the metal element, receives waste material and absorbs water and minerals that are important for the body. It is the last spot where the food we ingested is prepared to be expelled. If we do not know what to value we either let go of everything or we hold onto everything, physically swinging from constipation to loose stools. Even the things we surround ourselves with tell us something about how balanced our Metal element is: clutter in the house reflects a desire to hold onto things while a minimalist tendency reveals an inclination to let go of them.
