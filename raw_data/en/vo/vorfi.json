And we do take it for granted until we start losing our balance. Some people don't take it as seriously, but having balance and coordination are very important to our body functions. Many of us don't realize how important balance is until it starts to be affected. Of course we recognize that for athletic people it is a pretty great skill, but in fact it is important for every single one of us. And our balance and coordination are controlled by several parts of our body, including eyes and ears, that pass on the information through the nerves to muscles, so they can move around properly. For most people, these responses are quicker and they react simultaneously to stimuli than for those who have been experiencing some trouble with balance. But how is the balance lost? You already know that the eyes and ears send the input to send throughout the body the right signals to react to situations and it is a really fast response to the stimuli. But there is more to these functions in the body. For the brain to produce the right response, your neurological system gives the required signals to the body, and all the structure \"pieces\" of your body must be all aligned, otherwise the communication won't be as accurate. So, considering there is a pinched nerve, for example, the response will not be accurate and the signal will not be delivered. If these two systems don't work at the same time and are off in some way, your balance and coordination will probably be compromised. But there are other causes that can decrease your balance and coordination as well. Let's see some of the most common ones, including: Spinal Misalignments / Pinched Nerve As we've talked above, that interferes with the communication between the brain and muscles. Age As we grow older, our bodies start to suffer from wear and tear, and the bad spinal alignments and/or poor musculoskeletal health can cause problems with balance, increasing the risks of falling over. Also, conditions like arthritis and osteoporosis are more common in elderly people and can affect their balance and mobility. Inner ear dysfunctions Having problems in the inner ear can also affect the balance. Vertigo is one of the most common ones and can cause dizziness. There are other conditions, diseases and cases that can lead you to balance problems, like alcohol abuse, multiple sclerosis, muscle weakness, poor posture, lyme disease, head trauma ,tumors, space occupying lesions and a lot more. If you are experiencing any kind of problem with your balance, you should go see your care provider to understand what's happening to your body. Can Chiropractors Help With Balance? Yes. Here at Prestige, we're specialized in treating spinal misalignments and subluxations. And to correctly treat problems with balance, it is pretty important to restore the proper alignment of your musculoskeletal system if it is indeed the misalignment causing your balance issues. The chiropractor will first locate the area that has been affected by performing some orthopedic and neurological tests as well as mobilization tests to better understand where your misalignment may be. It's only to understand where the problem is and how to properly fix it. With the Chiropractic adjustments, your joints will move freely and your body will be better able to communicate to your spine again and send the right messages to your muscles. The most common adjustments are in the neck area, and in the lower back as many nerves tend to live in these areas. But your whole body will be checked to see if there is any other nerve blocking the signals and making you lose your balance. Alongside manipulations, postural exercises are important to help with balance problems and poor posture. They'll be taught here at Prestige for you to perform at your home.
