further requires the Council to consider any available mitigating evidence, except as specified. 38)Requires the Council, if it suspends a certificate for a sexually related crime or felony substantially related to the qualification, to take the following additional actions: SB 218 Page 8 a) Notify the certificate holder within 10 business days of the suspension, the reason therefor, and the holder's right to request a hearing; b) Notify any employer or contractor, and the appropriate local government permitting authority, within 10 business days of the suspension; and, c) Hold a hearing within 30 business days, if the holder of the suspended certificate so requests in writing, to challenge the factual basis for the suspension. EXISTING LAW: 1)Establishes the California Massage Therapy Council (CAMTC) and defines the responsibilities and duties of the CAMTC. (Business and Professions Code (BPC) Section 4600.5) 2)Requires the CAMTC to issue a \"massage therapist\" or \"massage practitioner\" certificate to an applicant, who submits a written application and provides satisfactory evidence that he or she meets all of the specified education, experience or examination requirements. (BCP 4601) 3)Makes the unlawful practice of medicine a public offense that may be punishable as either a misdemeanor or felony. (BPC 2052) 4)Regulates and licenses the practice of acupuncture by the Board. (BPC 4928) 5)Defines acupuncture as the stimulation of a certain point or points on or near the surface of the body by the insertion of needles to prevent or modify the perception of pain or to normalize physiological functions, including pain control, for the treatment of certain diseases or dysfunctions of the body and includes the techniques of electroacupuncture, cupping, and moxibustion. (BPC 4927) 6)Requires the California Acupuncture Board to issue a license to practice acupuncture to any person who makes an application, pays specified fees, and meets specified requirements. (BPC 4938) SB 218 Page 9 7)Makes the unlawful practice of acupuncture a public offense that may be punishable as a misdemeanor, with a fine of not less than $100 and not more than $2,500, or imprisonment in a county jail for a period not exceeding one year, or both. (BPC 4935) 8)Requires the Board to establish standards for the approval of schools and colleges offering education and training in the practice of an acupuncturist, as specified, and requires training programs to include 3,000 hours of study in curricula pertaining to the practice of acupuncture. (BPC 4939) 9)Requires each acupuncturist to complete 50 hours of continuing education every two years as a condition of renewal of his or her license. (BPC 4945) FISCAL EFFECT : Unknown COMMENTS : 1)Purpose of this bill . This bill would provide certification and title protection for the practice of \"traumatology\" - a branch of traditional Chinese medicine - to be overseen by a non-profit Council authorized in statute. Underlying concerns with the bill include questions as to its necessity, whether its provisions will ultimately inform or potentially confuse consumers, and whether or not the statute contains sufficient consumer protections and legislative oversight. This bill is sponsored by the American Traditional Chinese Medicine Traumatology Association (ATCMTA). 2)Author's statement . According to the author, \"Traumatology is an unregulated practice in the State of California. No government body oversees Traumatology's level of education, training and experience. SB 218 (Yee) will place this practice under a non-profit's oversight and assure the public in a standard level of experience, training and care.\" 3)Understanding traumatology and \"Traditional Chinese Medicine\" . As defined this bill, \"California traditional Chinese medicine traumatology\" includes \"a range of treatments to address both acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions through stimulation of acupressure points. Techniques include, SB 218 Page 10 but are not limited to, brushing, kneading, rolling, pressing, rubbing, pushing, holding, and lifting the areas between each of the joints to open the body's defensive chi and stimulate the energy movement in the meridians.\" It should be stressed that the bill's own provisions appear to restrict the scope of practice of CCTCMTs to acupressure alone, which is one of a larger number of modalities traditionally associated with traumatology. The bill explicitly excludes the practice of medicine and chiropractic, and the practice of acupuncture or physical therapy without a license is prohibited by existing law. Traumatology is considered a subset of traditional Chinese medicine, and, according to the author, has been practiced in an unlicensed fashion in California for roughly 150 years. Western medicine also uses the term \"traumatology\" to describe the unrelated study of wounds and injuries caused by accidents or violence and the repair of those wounds and injuries, and should not be confused with the practices of TCM. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) within the National Institutes of Health, the broader category of TCM originated in ancient China and has evolved over thousands of years. \"TCM practitioners use herbs, acupuncture and other methods to treat a wide range of conditions?The TCM view of how the human body works, what causes illness, and how to treat illness is different from Western medicine concepts?The human body is regarded as an organic entity in which the various organs, tissues, and other parts have distinct functions but are all interdependent. In this view, health and disease relate to balance of the functions.\" NCCAM also notes the breadth of its use: \"Today, TCM is practiced side by side with Western medicine in many of China's hospitals and clinics. TCM is widely used in the United States. Although the exact number of people who use TCM in the United States is unknown, it was estimated in 1997 that some 10,000 TCM practitioners served more than 1 million patients each year. However, NCCAM also strikes a note of caution: \"Although TCM SB 218 Page 11 is used by the American public, scientific evidence of its effectiveness is, for the most part, limited. Acupuncture has the largest body of evidence and is considered safe if practiced correctly. Some Chinese herbal remedies may be safe, but others may not be.\" As of 2012, there were approximately 60 accredited TCM educational institutes nationwide, with 20 located in California. There are no known national standards for traumatologists. Currently, traumatology courses are offered in accredited schools for acupuncture, but there is no known school in California that teaches traumatology exclusively. 4)Understanding the non-profit \"massage therapy\" model of professional certification . The non-profit Council proposed to be created by this bill was modeled after the non-profit California Massage Therapy Council (CAMTC) currently overseeing the certification and discipline of massage practitioners. CAMTC was enacted in 2008 (SB 731 (Oropeza), Chapter 384) to create a standardized system of voluntary statewide certification of massage professionals. Current law makes it an unfair business practice for anyone not certified by CAMTC to use certain massage-related titles. Applicants for certification must complete a specified number of educational hours and pass an examination which is administered by the National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork (NCBTMB). The statutes related to regulation of massage therapy and CAMTC will sunset on January 1, 2015 unless extended by legislative action. CAMTC is led by a volunteer board of directors comprised of professionals from California's massage community, including massage associations, schools, and businesses. While CAMTC does not accredit or approve schools, it does have the responsibility to determine if the curriculum of schools meets the legal requirements for applicants to obtain certification. Schools must either be nationally accredited or approved by the California Bureau for Private Postsecondary Education or a California community college. CAMTC regulates approximately SB 218 Page 12 38,000 certified massage professionals. If a certificate holder violates the terms of certification, CAMTC is authorized to suspend or revoke the holder's certification, but CAMTC has no cite and fine authority. CAMTC may deny, discipline or revoke certification for a variety of reasons including: failure to obtain a clear fingerprint check; reports of unprofessional conduct in another state; any attempt to obtain a certificate through misrepresentation or fraud; or committing any act punishable as a sexually-related crime. All of the relative disciplinary procedures are carried out by an employee of CAMTC. Since 2010, there have been approximately 130 certificate suspensions or revocations. 5)Arguments in support . According to the American Association of Acupuncture & Traditional Chinese Medicine, \"SB 218 (Yee)?would provide a pathway for skilled traumatologists, trained in this unique branch of [TCM] to achieve certification from the State of California. The establishment of high educational standards and oversight would provide Californians with basic assurances of safety when receiving services from a [CCTCMT]. \"?Some acupuncture organizations have made the argument that the establishment of a traumatology certification would endanger public safety. This assumption is absolutely misguided. Traumatology, unlike acupuncture, is an unregulated profession in California. How can an unregulated practice be more dangerous than one that is under state jurisdiction? SB 218 will increase public safety by regulating this profession. \"Second, a few acupuncture organizations contend that the education provisions of SB 218 are inadequate. The opposition bases their claims on the practice of traumatology in China. Chinese traumatologists have clinical duties within hospitals, and may even diagnose and practice medicine. Obviously, the practice of traumatology in California is very limited compared with China. A California certified traumatologist will not have the same duties and responsibilities of as a traumatologist in China, and, therefore, will not require an equivalent level of education?. \"SB 218 would simply bring about a public recognition of this SB 218 Page 13 unique branch of TCM. This bill would provide the legal means for traumatologists to obtain certification, resulting in increased mainstream acceptance and the implementation of oversight to safeguard the public.\" 6)Arguments in opposition . According to the California Acupuncture Coalition, which has taken an Oppose Unless Amended position, states that \"SB 218 will confuse and endanger consumers. The proposed certification title utilizes the terms \"Chinese medicine\" and \"traditional Chinese medicine.\" Both terms are essentially synonymous with fullscope, fulltraining acupuncture and Asian medicine professionals. These terms are internationally recognized by entities such as the World Health Organization and the National Institutes of Health .... Use of these terms in conjunction with a substandard7) certification will confuse consumers, potentially misleading consumers into believing that certificants possess significantly deeper and broader levels of training than would be required under this bill.\" CAC also contends that the use of the term \"Chinese medicine\" in the title authorized by this bill conflicts with the intent of the Acupuncture Act because of its prohibition on representing oneself as trained, experienced or an expert in Chinese medicine without an acupuncture license. \"Accordingly, the CAC remains strongly opposed to SB 218 unless it is amended to remove from the certificate title the term Chinese medicine or any other term likely to cause the consumer public to confuse certificants with fullscope, fulltraining licensed acupunctur8)ists.\" 9)This bill in practice . The practical effect of this bill would be to create a non-profit Council funded by user fees or other donations that would set its own educational, training and testing standards, allowing individuals to advertise themselves as \"California certified\" traumatologists. Those without certificates could continue to provide traumatology services that are otherwise legal, as long as the practitioners do not claim to be certified. The traumatology practices covered by this bill would be limited to acupressure. Discipline by the Council would be limited to action against the certificate, ranging from minor restrictions to complete revocation. 10)Questions for the Committee. The most recent version of this SB 218 Page 14 bill presents a number of outstanding questions and issues that the Committee may wish to consider: a) Is this bill necessary ? The California Acupuncture Board has estimated that there are 150 practitioners of traumatology in this state, although it is unknown how many of these practitioners would seek a certification, or if applicants might come from other states or countries. The number of potential applicants is difficult to forecast since the qualifications for the certificate are left largely to the discretion of the Council. The Committee may wish to consider at the threshold whether or not this bill is necessary in light of the small number of potential applicants. Furthermore, given that the Council and its work would need to be supported exclusively by fees - and cannot even start issuing certificates until it has completed its design of education, training and testing standards - it is not clear how the Council could be created and operated over the long term with such a low number of expected applicants. The Senate Appropriations Committee analysis of a prior version of this bill noted that it expected a similar program situated under the California Acupuncture Board, proposed by a previous version of this bill, to have start-up costs of $80,000 and ongoing costs between $150,000 and $200,000 per year. While fiscal matters are outside the purview of this Committee, the question remains whether there are enough potential applicants to justify and support the creation of a third party certificating body for title rights alone. The Committee may also wish to inquire of the author as to the evidence of consumer confusion in the market for traumatology services that cannot be addressed by existing law and therefore make title protection necessary. b) Will this bill decrease, or increase, consumer confusion ? As noted above, this bill only authorizes certain individuals to use the term \"California certified\" in advertising traumatology services (which may only include acupressure). It does not stop uncertified individuals from claiming to offer traumatology services. SB 218 Page 15 There is also some confusion as to the boundary between traumatology as defined by this bill and the practice of acupuncture. The Acupuncture Licensure Act prohibits individuals without an acupuncture license from \"representing that he or she is trained, experienced, or an expert in the field of acupuncture, Asian medicine or Chinese medicine.\" As a result, the title provided by this bill - which contains the words \"Chinese medicine\" - may actually confuse consumers as to what kind of treatments a particular practitioner is licensed to provide. More importantly, it allows an individual to advertise him or herself as 'California certified', but the state would have very little role in the setting of standards for the educational, training and testing requirements. The Council would have that responsibility and others, including the investigation of applicants' qualifications and deciding matters of discipline. As a result, consumers may get the mistaken impression that the state has created - and investigates and enforces - standards for the proper practice of traumatology when the regulation is actually performed by a private party. There is also a possibility of confusion based on the scope of practice provided for in this bill. By its own terms, this bill appears to be limited to acupressure, but the curriculum described in the qualifications section includes \"Chinese herbs and formulas\" (which is part of what is generally thought of as traumatology). As such, consumers may be confused as to what kinds of services are really being \"certified\", and even applicants or certificate holders may not be clear on which practices fall under the scope of the certificate and which do not. As such, the Committee may wish to consider whether or not the title protection offered by this bill would actually better inform consumers about the nature and quality of traumatology services, and help them make a more useful distinction between certificated and uncertificated providers. c) Does the state have sufficient oversight capability to ensure consumer protection ? As noted above, the state would have little control over the standards set or the decisions made by the Council. And while this model of SB 218 Page 16 self-regulation does have some precedent in the industries of massage therapy, interior design and tax preparation, those professions generally do not purport to exist for the treatment of health conditions. This bill describes traumatology as offering \"a range of treatments to address both acute and chronic musculoskeletal conditions.\" As such, the Committee may wish to consider whether or not it is appropriate for a profession that views itself as a health care treatment provider should be entirely self-regulating while operating under the aegis of the state. Further, this bill does not include basic consumer protections found under the CAMTC model, such as fingerprinting, background checks, or a standard \"sunset date\" for its authority. There are also outstanding technical issues, not the least of which is the lack of any designated authority to select the two representatives to the Council from the traumatology industry. It should also be made explicit that it is unprofessional conduct to fail to comply with the Health Freedom Act (BPC 2053.5 & 2053.6), which requires specified disclosures to patients when providing certain alternative or complementary medicine treatments, such as the use of herbal remedies, which do not constitute the practice of medicine. The Committee may wish to consider whether or not this bill contains sufficient consumer protection safeguards to justify the granting of a title that includes the words \"California certified.\" 11)Prior legislation . SB 1488 (Yee) of 2012 would have established the California Traditional Chinese Medicine Traumatology Council as a non-profit organization to provide for the certification and regulation of the practice of California traditional Chinese Medicine traumatologists, as well as report to the Legislature on standards for approving education programs, and evaluating the education, training and clinical experience of applicants. That bill failed passage in the Assembly Business, Professions and Consumer Protection Committee. SB 628 (Yee) of 2011 would have changed the name of the SB 218 Page 17 California Acupuncture Board to the \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Board,\" redesignated licensed acupuncturists as licensed \"Traditional Chinese Medicine Practitioners,\" and would have included traumatology in the authorized activities of a licensed acupuncturist. That bill failed passage in the Assembly Business, Professions and Consumer Protection Committee. SB 731 (Oropeza) (Chapter 384, Statutes of 2008), established the voluntary statewide certification of massage therapists by the Massage Therapy Organization (MTO), which was renamed the CAMTC in 2011. The goal of the CAMTC is to standardize the process of certification throughout the state. The certification allows for massage professionals to work in multiple California locations without the need for multiple permits or fees.
