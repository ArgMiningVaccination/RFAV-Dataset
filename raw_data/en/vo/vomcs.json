[Faculty of Natural Health Science via distance learning](/programs/faculty-of-natural-health-science.html) Regenerative Cellular Therapy via distance learning This program explains how good health is the result of the correct functioning of our cells and the optimal balance of their biochemical interaction. Regenerative Cellular Therapy focuses in balancing oxidative stress, intestinal flora, the immunological system, hormones and the influence of our mind and emotions on ourselves. The intervention over these five balances makes use of several therapeutic tools such as orthomolecular nutrition, ozone therapy, chelation therapy, intestinal and digestive health, exercise and other effective tools for the wellbeing of our mind and emotions. Regenerative Cellular Therapy does not only promote good health, but is also highly effective in anti-aging.

It considers the dietary sources and role of minerals and vitamins in health, and the role of modern food technology on the availability of these nutrients in our food supply. Academic Supervisor: Marcos Mazzuka Petitta Oligotherapy This course explains how to administer precise amounts of oligo elements to treat different health disorders. Oligotherapy works upon the cell's enzymes by introducing precise low level amounts of specific trace elements which serve to detoxify and reactivate blocked healthy enzyme processes. These elements restore the normal functioning capacity of the cell and enables the body to utilize essential vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients to obtain the right healing process. Academic Supervisor: Boris Wydoff Colon Therapy This course stresses on the significance of colon hygiene in health recovery and its effects on absorption and assimilation of nutrients, cleansing procedures and detoxification, colon hydrotherapy, parasites, and other related pathological disorders. It details the therapeutic programs designed to enhance or alleviate these situations. Academic Supervisor: Boris Wydoff Cell Biology This course provides an integrated study of the structure, function, and interactions of cells, with an emphasis on their molecular composition and dynamics. Topics covered include: membrane structure and transport; receptors and channels; protein targeting; cytoskeleton; cell cycle control; signal transduction; programmed cell death; adhesion and differentiation. Academic Supervisor: Jose R. Vazquez Biochemical Organic Balance Every disease, symptom, discharge, and pain indicates a chemical imbalance in the body. A body that is chemically well-balanced will normalize itself. This course focuses on the chemical elements, their structures, and their application, including vitamins, enzymes, proteins, starches, prostaglandins, and minerals found in foods in order to understand the biochemical organic balance from which health and well-being spring.
