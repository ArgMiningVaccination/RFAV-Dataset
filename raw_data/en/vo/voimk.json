She asked about migraines. She had tried medication, which gave her a rash and less than satisfactory results. I told her that migraines are tricky because there can be so many causes. Hormones, allergies, stress, dehydration, chemical exposure....the list goes on. [Let's Talk Poison](/blog1/2023/7/22/lets-talk-poison) [Harvesting Mullein](/blog1/2023/7/2/harvesting-mullein) [Congratulations Herbalist Class Graduates](/blog1/2023/4/4/congratulations-herbalist-class-graduates) These wonderful students put in 15 hours of class instruction learning about how to use herbs in the home. We made infused oils, salves, tinctures, poultices, and teas. We learned about the HEAT of super tonic and the comfort of a rice sock. We ate homemade chocolate and even made toothpaste and shampoo. [New Year's Resolutions at Healthy Life Solutions](/blog1/2023/1/12/new-years-resolutions-at-healthy-life-solutions) I have never been a big fan of making resolutions. After all, they usually last about a week and then you are done! I do however like to look back on the last year, evaluate, and set goals for the next season. Setting a goal requires having a way to measure it. So not a vague, \"I want to lose weight this year.\" But rather, list the exact amount you wish to lose in January. Something measurable and with a time limit. A due date if you will. [Is Your Body Broken?](/blog1/2021/11/10/is-your-body-broken) Allopathic medicine and Natural medicine look at the body in different ways. Allopathic medicine says that the body is broken and needs medical intervention to fix it. Natural medicine believes that the body has an amazing ability to heal itself; the body is working, let's give it the nutrients and support it needs to function properly. These two views sometimes contrast drastically in the way they would treat an illness. [Super Tonic Recipe](/blog1/2021/9/1/super-tonic-recipe) Super Tonic is one of my family's favorite remedies. I make it every fall and keep it in the refrigerator for the winter cold and flu season. We like to keep the pulp in the tincture and just take a spoonful whenever you feel a bit off. Chase the heat with a slice of apple. This also makes a great seasoning for chicken. I love to add it to my homemade hummus, yum!

Many of us missed one last year, so we are excited to get going this year. What do you need to take with you to stay healthy and be prepared for travel emergencies?

[Are You Sleeping?](/blog1/2021/5/28/are-you-sleeping) I had a restless night. Seemed to wake up every hour, with too much on my mind. It has been 3 months since my husband passed away and I think the grief and reality is sinking into my brain. I can't do anything about the circumstances that are keeping me awake, but I can take some herbs to help me process it all and relax more. Here are a few that I am considering and they might help you too. "}
