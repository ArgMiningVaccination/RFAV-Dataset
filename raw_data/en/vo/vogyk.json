For most of the 180 kilometer, or 112 mile, drive from Verona, the landscape is dotted with vineyards and spectacular medieval fortresses carved into the mountainside. Street signs along the way are in German and Italian, a reminder that until the end of World War I, the region was part of Austria. From the early 19th century onward, under Austria-Hungary's Hapsburg emperors, Meran, as it was then called, was a favored destination of European aristocracy, both for its dry climate and its healing thermal waters. It still is. Facing the neo-classical structure of the Merano Palace, a five-star hotel in the center of the town, a statue of Sisi, Elisabeth of Bavaria, the beautiful and fragile wife of Emperor Franz Joseph I, stands as a reminder of the town's history. Today, the hotel houses the Espace Henri Chenot, a luxury health center catering to an international clientele of people seriously interested in their own beauty and well-being. \"Merano is not Cannes. We did not choose this location for its glamour,\" said Henri Chenot, a Frenchman, who took over and renovated the hotel in the early 1980s. \"The Espace Chenot is not a spa, it is a wellness and detoxification center,\" he said. \"We chose it for its mild temperatures and its accessibility in the center of Europe. But mostly, we value the privacy it affords our clients.\" The hotel and its restaurant are dedicated to serving the clients of the Espace Chenot, where Mr. Chenot applies treatments that he has refined over 40 years \"to stay young as long as possible and age healthily.\" Most clients sign up for a week-long program in which, after a comprehensive medical examination and a session with a dietitian, each is given a personalized program based on the principles of \"Biontology,\" a health regime devised by Mr. Chenot that combines ancient Chinese medicine with advanced Western science. \"Eighty percent of toxins are produced by our own organism. Over time, their elimination is impaired by our genetics and the aging process,\" said Mr. Chenot, who holds doctorates in psychology and philosophy. He holds no medical qualification, though the center's doctors do. The daily routine, personalized to the needs of each client, includes energetic treatments that measure the body's energy flows with electric pulses and tendon-muscle massages. Hydro-energy treatments like hydro-aromatherapy and phyto-mud therapy sessions are followed by hydrojet massages. \"A detox program can be complicated, and the body reacts rapidly. That is why we provide strict control with medical supervision and individualized attention,\" Mr. Chenot said. Though many clients come to lose weight - a collateral effect of the treatment - the Merano cure is primarily marketed as a way to achieve a balance between mind and body and reduce the long-term effects of stress and toxicity. \"Hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol are the costliest maladies today. We focus on nutrition to regenerate the body's vital functions at different stages of life,\" Mr. Chenot said. It is easy to feel famished and lightheaded for the first two days after a 24-hour liquid fast followed by a Spartan regimen of broth, exquisitely presented fruits and complex carbohydrates, served occasionally with fish or tofu, washed down with lemon water or barley coffee. The restaurant offers a sparse but tasty cuisine devised by Mr. Chenot's wife, Dominique, a nutrition expert, based on the antioxidant power of nutrients rather than calorie count. This may be Italy, but there is no sign of parmesan cheese. \"Many ingredients are prohibited here. The kitchen must work within those restrictions,\" Mr. Chenot said. While following this cleansing diet, lying out by the pool is about the most extreme exercise that most guests manage, though the center boasts a state-of-the-art gym for those who insist. \"Clients do not come here to exercise. Intense physical activity is not recommended,\" Mr. Chenot said. For the hyperactive, there are walks in downtown Merano and the botanical gardens, including those of the nearby Trattmansdorff Castle. Reflecting its history, Merano's culture mixes Germanic and Italian. To the dismay of some of Mr. Chenot's clients, street vendors tout heisse w\u00fcrstel, and gelati, or hot sausages and ice cream. Sometimes the inevitable happens. \"A client here had a cappuccino in town one day. It was explained to him how it was the most expensive one he had ever had,\" said a waiter in the center's restaurant. According to Mr. Chenot, the slightest digression from his regimen can wreak havoc on the body and undo the benefits of the cure. Despite the requirement for rigid adherence to its rules, the Espace Chenot has developed a faithful clientele. \"We cater to 60 percent returning clients. Our clientele has gone from 90 percent to 40 percent Italians. Now we have many French, Swiss and Russians, often more men than women,\" said Sigrid Auer, the Center's spa administrator and client-relations manager, who joined the Chenot team 36 years ago. Even while managing a staff of 80, Ms. Auer still personally attends to each of the 100 guests. After a one-week program, this guest left Merano feeling genuinely healthy, invigorated and mentally alert, not to mention measurably lighter and full of virtuous nutritional intentions for the future. A six-day comprehensive program costs \u20ac2,500, or about $3,750, excluding accommodations at the Merano Palace, compulsory medical visits and tempting extras like Mr. Chenot's line of health and beauty products. \"Many clients come to us before applying for life insurance,\" said Mr. Chenot. Those who have been here see the fee as the price of a new lease on life. "}
