Annual Report3 Mission To serve justice in Illinois and increase public safety by promoting positive change in behavior, operating successful reentry programs, and reducing victimization. Vision We will operate safe, secure, and humane correctional facilities. We will provide quality services to those who require medical and mental health treatment. We will evaluate offenders individually and develop an appropriate course of action based on individual needs. We will reduce recidivism by offering seamless, efficient services that are geared toward rehabilitation. Staff is our greatest asset, and we will ensure that all staff is trained to the highest professional level. This is a team-based environment where open communication and sharing new ideas are encouraged. We value the well-being of IDOC staff and individuals in custody and will serve the people of Illinois with compassion and fairness. Core Values Professionalism Integrity Civility Transparency Accountability ResponsivenessIllinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report4Illinois Correctional Industries During FY21, the Illinois Correctional Industries (ICI) played an integral role in IDOC's response to COVID-19. Shops produced necessary items for facility management during this unprecedented time including cleaning supplies, personal protective equipment, and food items. Additionally, ICI's logistics team of was pivotal in the transportation of emergency supplies purchased by the Department and received from other supporting agencies. ICI maintained operations as well as could be expected during this fiscal year , offering participants vital experience and training. The U.S. Department of Labor apprenticeship programs allows ICI program participants to earn vocational certificates as a Baker, Office Administrator, Cabinetmaker, Furniture Finisher, Furniture Upholsterer, Machine Set-up Operator, Machinist, Metal Fabricator, Meat Butcher, Graphic Designer, and Animal Trainer. Participants utilize the experience and skills they obtain while working for Illinois Correctional Industries to better themselves upon return to society. The programming offered by ICI allows individuals in custody to learn valuable skills and experience while earning day for day Earned Program Sentence Credit. These credits give individuals an opportunity to return to society sooner where they can put the learned skills to work and reduce the length and cost of incarceration. Investigations and Intelligence During FY21, the Intelligence Unit successfully navigated through the COVID-19 pandemic and completed 5,507 advisories with 44% (2,444) being proactive intelligence gathering. Daily, staff from the Intelligence Units at every facility aided in operational decision making by providing key input regarding the temperament of the population at each facility. The Intelligence Units would report daily the number of phone calls and GTL messages monitored and would report their findings on how the pandemic was impacting the individual in custody population based on their surveillance. During FY21, over 168,000 phone calls wer e monitored by Intelligence Unit staff. The Intelligence Unit maintained proactive measures by searching over 3,700 cells and over 2,300 common areas. These searches resulted in over 1,000 items of contraband being discovered. Intelligence Unit staff were able to complete over 21,000 interviews and maintained contact with confidential sources. During FY21, through surveillance, the Intelligence Unit was able to identify multiple new Security Threat Group Nation level leaders, and these identifications continue to assist outside law enfor cement agencies and their intelligence communities. Despite the pandemic, the Intelligence Unit was able to assist outside law enfor cement agencies by completing over 4,000 requests from across the country. In FY21, the Intelligence Unit lead the charge against a new threat facing the department, the emergence of synthetic drug laced mail. In this timeframe, Intelligence staff wer e able to generate over 100 reports concerning synthetic drug confiscations, and introduction preventions. The Intelligence Unit was quick to develop and implement training that raised staff's awareness of the threat. This training continues to be a part of facility cycle training, cadet training, as well as non-security pre-service training. Also, in FY21, the Investigations Unit conducted a statewide Warden and Assistant Warden training for those who were responsible for reviewing Reports of Investigations and documenting such in the CLIC system. This training was an overview of what the Warden's responsibilities were when reviewing a report and what to look for when editing an investigation. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report5Office of Administrative Directive Standards The Office of Administrative Directive Standards (formerly known as the Office of Performance Based Standards) is comprised of a manager, three Regional Coordinators, and an Executive I. The Office is responsible for conducting annual reviews of policies and procedures at all facilities and adult transition centers. During a typical fiscal year, select trained and experienced team members from throughout IDOC perform, under the direction of the assigned Regional Coordinator, external reviews at each of the Department's adult facilities. The reviews are conducted to gauge compliance with existing Departmental Rules, Administrative Directives, and Institutional Directives at each individual facility. Beginning July 1, 2019, while the internal review process in each facility continued, the external review process was suspended throughout the Department. This temporary suspension allowed for the Office of Administrative Directive Standards to refocus and improve upon the review process. Changes made during this timeframe included a review and rewrite of each compliance review instrument and the transformation into Illinois Standards to better serve the review process. Moving forward, the use of Illinois Standards will not only rely on the requirements of the Departmental Rules and Administrative Directives but will also include specific and targeted areas of concern, including court settlement agreements and executive and administrative areas of concern. In addition, the Illinois Standards will include references to existing national standards as established by the American Correctional Association (ACA) and the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC). Through inclusion of these nationally recognized best practices, both the internal and external review processes will ensure Department facilities are meeting the requirements of our own policies as well as those by national agencies, ultimately aiding in the certification process of these agencies. In January 2020 Department Executive Staff members attended the ACA's Winter Conference in San Diego, California where they met with ACA Executive Staff members. Discussions were held regarding IDOC returning to the ACA accreditation process, which involves assessments that cover administration and management, the physical plant, institutional operations and services, and inmate programs. It also assesses issues and concerns that may affect the quality of life at a facility such as staff training, adequacy of medical services, sanitation, use of segregation and detention, incidents of violence, crowding, offender activity levels, programs, and provisions of basic services that may impact the life, safety and health of inmates, as well as staff. ACA accreditation requires written policy and procedures to establish a training and staff development program for all categories of personnel. The training requirements address all pre-service, in-service, and specialized training curricula with clear timelines, and considers the institution's mission, physical characteristics, and inmate populations. The professional growth of employees is systematically developed through training plans that annually identify current job-related training needs in relation to position requirements, current correctional issues, new theories, techniques, and technologies, ultimately improving staff morale and professionalism. ACA accreditation is awarded to the \"best of the best\" and it was time for IDOC to move forward with their journey to excellence with the assistance of ACA. Through the meeting and discussions held in January 2020 the framework was established for IDOC to return to the process of seeking accreditation through the ACA. By February 2020, it was announced that the Pinckneyville Correctional Center would undergo an audit by ACA auditors in November 2020. The Office of Administrative Directive Standards worked closely with Pinckneyville CC staff members to establish a digital process of preparing for the ACA audit, reducing the reliance on physical files for nearly 600 ACA standards. As a result of the tireless work performed by the Pinckneyville CC staff and the Office of Administrative Directives, the Pinckneyville CC was successful in their accreditation process, receiving a rating of 100% on mandatory standards and 99.3% on non-mandatory standards. The work performed by the Office of Administrative Directive Standards along with the Pinckneyville CC staff members will serve as a template for future accreditations of IDOC facilities.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report6Office of Constituent Services FY21 was a year of refocus and reinvention for the Constituent Services Unit. Through the global pandemic, the Unit acquired skills which allowed its team to effectively advocate on behalf of community stakeholders. The Unit also tailored its focus on community outreach and engagement, allowing the team to proactively deliver on its mission to manage effective communication between the community at lar ge and IDOC. In FY21, the Constituent Services Unit addressed concerns of stakeholders through multiple mediums, including, digital communication, email, telecom services, letters, face to face interactions and r eferrals from community organizations. The Constituent Services Unit also developed and implemented a more data focused approach to community interaction. These changes were illustrated by the creation of dedicated tracking tools and metrics, and the creation of internal policy with a focus on responsiveness to the citizens of the State of Illinois. In FY21, the Office of Constituent Services hosted four virtual 'Summit of Hope' events in five communities throughout the state. The events were delivered with the support of the Illinois Department of Corrections Parole Division, the Illinois Department of Corrections Parole Reentry Group, and the Illinois Department of Public Health Ryan White Program. During each event, attendees were introduced to community-based assistance organizations. These summits further assisted in building meaningful relationships to help reintroduce returning citizens to the community. The major focal points of these forums addressed the areas of need most identified by those reentering the community; housing, employment, healthcare, and COVID-19. Each Summit of Hope event was executed through a virtual platform with various resources and resource providers acting as vendors, encouraging parolees to take advantage of free services. The summits were also aimed at not only addressing those areas identified by those re-entering the community, but also in providing them with both information and access to the necessary regional resources to assist them. The first summit was held in August 2020 in Rockford, Illinois. This summit was held in partnership with the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Illinois Representative from the 67th District. The second took place in October 2020 in Springfield, Illinois. This summit was held in partnership with the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Springfield Urban League. The third was held in December 2020 in Peoria, Illinois with the Illinois Department of Public Health, and the Illinois Public Health Association. The final summit was held on March 24, 2021, in Champaign-Urbana with the Illinois Department of Public Health and the City Commission for Champaign-Urbana. Office of Health Services The Office of Health Services (OHS) has taken an aggressive approach to protecting staff and the incarcerated population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical staff play a key r ole in the Incident Command Center developing detailed guidelines for testing, isolating, quarantining, sanitation, personal pr otective equipment, treatment, and more. OHS continued collaborate with IDPH and IEMA, incorporating CDC guidelines, and developing immunization and vaccination plans. In FY21, OHS released dental guidelines to IDOC facilities and hired a Chief of Oral Health Services. In July 2021, OHS assembled a committee to hear presentations for transgender individuals in custody in preparation for gender affirming surgery. In September 2021, OHS advanced transgender program by hosting presentations in conjunction with WPATH and contracted with a gender affirming surgeon and endocrinologist in December 2021. In 2022, the Department published administrative dir ectives related to transgender health care and approved the first patient for gender affirming surgery.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report7Administrative Review Board In FY21, the Administrative Review Board received 16,641 grievances. All grievances that receive a review by the Administrative Review Board are receipted. A copy of the receipt is sent to the individual in custody notifying him or her that their grievance has been received and will be reviewed. This procedure stems from a grievance receipt process that was implemented statewide on November 1, 2018. Seven chairpersons are responsible for reviewing all grievance submissions and receipting and responding to them. An Executive I within the unit reviews all facility revocations/restorations of time submissions. In FY21, the Administrative Review Board received 2,358 facility submissions for revocations and/or restorations. The Administrative Review Board reviews these submissions to ensure the ticket was written correctly, the hearing was conducted properly, discipline is in line with prior discipline and/or the offense, and if SMI, the proper mental health review was conducted. The Administrative Review Board conducts approximately 30 protective custody hearings a month for IDOC's maximum-security facilities. In addition, the Administrative Review Board reviews and makes determinations on any person in custody who is removed from IDOC's bootcamp program. Due to the number of subpoenas the Administrative Review Board receives from various legal entities, a full- time position was established to respond to the requests. In FY21, ARB received 750 legal requests with the Administrative Review Board supplying a total of 101,233 pages of records. Operations Jail and Detention Standards The mission of the Jail and Detention Standards Unit is to monitor compliance with Illinois County Jail Standards, Illinois Municipal Jail and Lockup Standards and the Federal Juvenile Justice Delinquency Prevention Act. The purpose of monitoring is to develop standardized practices in detention facilities that enhance the health and safety of the detainees, detention staff and the public. In addition, the office aids and services to facilitate the development of those practices. State statute established the unit and directed that the office will inspect all 91 county jails on an annual basis. Municipal lockups are inspected upon request of the chief of police. In FY21, 13 municipal inspections were completed. Jail and Detention Standards has the authority to refer facilities in serious noncompliance to the Illinois Attorney General for remediation. This authority has recommended further review of specific substandard facilities. The unit also approves new facility construction of jails, and lockups throughout Illinois. Staff members monitor approximately 1,100 municipal police departments and 91 county jails for compliance with federal secure juvenile detention requirements. In FY21, there were 400 juvenile monitoring inspections completed by the unit. The Jail and Detention Standar ds Unit provides an adequate system of monitoring jails, lockups and non-secure facilities to ensure that delinquent minors are being held in accordance with the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention policies and procedures. The criminal justice specialists annually visit law enforcement facilities to determine which facilities detain youths and which do not. Those who do not detain youths are considered No Hold facilities and only need to be visited every three years rather than annually. Criminal justice specialists conduct on-site inspections of county jails and municipal lockups for compliance with standards. All 91 county jails were inspected in 2020 and 2021. Staff members conduct follow-ups on Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report8unusual occurrences and provide consultations regarding detention operations, renovations, new construction, and staffing recommendations. In the capacity of consultants, unit staff responds to citizen and detainee complaints relating to detention operations, civil rights and legal responsibilities. The unit responded to 85 detainee complaint letters and provided 246 technical assistance requests to jails in FY21. The unit collects monthly detainee population statistics from county jails and quarterly from municipal lockups. A database is maintained for this information, which is ultimately sent to the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority on an annual basis. Operations Center The Operations Center is a multifaceted area within IDOC. The center, which provides 24-hour assistance and availability, serves as the statewide command post serving the needs for both adult and juvenile offenders within IDOC and the Illinois Department of Juvenile Justice. The Operations Center pr ovides continuous Law Enforcement Agencies Data System/ National Crime Information Center (LEADS/NCIC) communication, access and maintenance of parole warrants and related information to field staff. In addition, it tracks all mass high-risk institution and parole transports of offenders, providing another layer of safety and efficiency. The center is also responsible for dissemination of local and federal criminal history data to appropriate IDOC agents, offices, and local law enforcement agencies. In addition, the Operations Center handles a large volume of phone calls daily and serves as an instrumental liaison for IDOC to law enforcement agencies and the public. Transfer Coordinator's Office The Transfer Coordinator's Office (TCO) is responsible for coordinating the movement of and determining the appropriate placement of all adult individuals in custody within IDOC. Since the TCO was established over 30 years ago, the Department has expanded to the present level of 23 adult facilities, 2 mental health facilities, and 3 Life Skills Re-Entry facilities, 4 reception and classification centers (R & C), adult transitional centers (ATC) and Impact Incarceration Programs (IIC). To efficiently coordinate individual in custody placement and movement, the TCO's present staffing level consists of Transfer Coordinator Manager (SPSA), two Assistant Managers (PSA), ten Assignment Coordinators, and six Clerical Staff. The TCO determines any initial or subsequent security and placement designations of individuals in custody prior to their movement. Every individual in custody's General Office file is reviewed annually to determine appropriate placement, balancing between the protection and safety of the public, and the individual in custody's needs. An individual in custody's special needs that are considered in placement decisions would include but are not limited to ADA issues, substance abuse treatment needs, Security Threat Group issues, Keep Separate From (KSF) issues, medical or mental health needs, protective custody or special management needs, those individuals in custody classified as Sexually Danger ous Persons (SDP) or Sexually Violent Person (SVP) and those individuals in custody considered as extreme escape risks. There is an imperative need to keep the population flowing out of the Reception & Classification Centers to facilitate the continual delivery fr om the county jails. The TCO also screens and coordinates individual in custody placement within the Impact Incarceration Programs, Adult Transitional Centers, and Electronic Detention. The TCO serves as the liaison and coordinator of the Interstate Corrections Compact and is responsible for coordinating the transfer of individuals in custody on an international level in cooperation with the Department of Justice. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report9Additionally, the TCO is responsible for overseeing the awarding of Earned Discretionary Sentence Credits on behalf of the Chief Public Safety Officer to all eligible individuals in custody . This factor as well as the placement of individuals in custody in the Adult Transitional Center programs and placement on ED are resources utilized in population control. Placement of an approved individual in custody in an ATC or on ED is done after all proper notifications are sent to the Sheriffs and States Attorneys as mandated by the statute. Individuals in custody who are approved for transfer are then prioritized for movement based on bed space, bus availability, and the urgency for transfer. Factors such as discipline, enemy or safety issues, warrants or detainers, programming, writ housing, changes in security and medical or mental health conditions are considered when determining priorities. The movement of individuals in custody involves statewide coordination of the Central Transportation Unit (CTU) by the TCO using 20 buses at 14 facilities. To ensure bus availability, the TCO is in constant contact with the facilities to ensure that the buses, which are aging and high in miles, are maintained and safe to drive long distances. Additionally, the TCO coordinates transportation for Cadet Training Classes. Cadets require transport from their parent facilities to and from the Training Academy on Mondays and Fridays. They also need transport for any special training exercises that take place during each class. Administrative Keep Separate From (KSF) add and removal requests are processed by the TCO, as are requests to remove KSFs between individuals in custody. A statewide bed report is compiled daily, including the beds required for a variety of units. Writ transfer requests are individually reviewed, and the transfer destinations are selected. Correspondence and calls from individuals in custody, their families, concerned citizens, attorneys, law enforcement, government officials and agencies, IDOC administrators and legal staff are received and acknowledged daily. Other duties include compiling reports, completing special projects, and maintaining special population profiles. Ensuring the correct placement recommendation and transport for the individuals in custody state-wide has always been a multi-faceted process. This process was made additionally complex in March of 2020 due to the ever-changing COVID-19 guidelines. Despite the shutdowns, quarantines, additional duties, and fluctuating health and safety guidelines, the TCO was able to provide results. In the middle of March 2020, all movement was suspended due to COVID-19. However, the Department is unable to function without movement, and transfers were gradually reinstated while honoring the requirements provided by the Office of Health Services. All transfers between facilities that could not be accommodated on bus movement wer e individually approved by their respective Deputy Director, TCO and OHS. During FY21, a total of 7,404 individuals in custody moved via the Central Transportation Unit, an average of 142 per week. In addition, CTU handles the movement of correctional officer cadets to and from the Training Academy for their Pre-Service Security Training. In FY21, 1,916 correctional officer cadets were transported, an average of 39 cadets per week. During FY21, the TCO Assignment Coordinators approved placements for 7,299 individuals in custody from R & C facilities. The TCO processed 12,780 transfer requests and completed 5,645 offender security reclassifications. The TCO processed 864 ATC requests, and 242 Substance Abuse program transfer requests. Lastly, all intake requests from county jails were meticulously tracked, the intakes scheduled, and the individuals in custody quarantined and tested by both the sending and the receiving facilities. All aspects of this process had to be communicated with the jails from all 102 counties as well as the 4 R & C's on a daily basis by TCO staff. Because accepting county intakes was a mandatory function, moving individuals in custody out of the R & C's was also exigent despite the new hurdles in doing so. As the preceding summary reflects, the responsibilities of the Transfer Coordinator's Office extend far beyond the scope of transferring individuals in custody throughout the State of Illinois. The TCO has remained dynamic, adapting to the fluctuating demands of the times. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report10Parole The Parole Division aims to promote public safety through supervision utilizing reentry resources, community partnerships and graduated sanctions. This division is dedicated to r educing recidivism and emphasizes the needs of returning citizens to the community by focusing on housing options, mental health issues, options for employment opportunities, and establishing networks to ensure adequate medical care is available. In addition to Violence Reduction Collaborations and Day Reporting Centers, the Parole Division has implemented Video Visitation and a Risk Assessment Tool to assist with the supervision of Parolees in the community. The Parole Division in conjunction with Chicago Police Department, local community members, the U.S. Attorney's Office, Cook County State's Attorney Office, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and numerous other agencies in key police districts throughout the Chicago area hold informational forums with gang affiliated parolees to combat violence in the community. IDOC utilizes Day Reporting Centers (DRC) as a resource and re-entry for persons under parole supervision who are vulnerable to drugs, crime, gangs, violence, unemployment, poverty, and family dissolution. These centers include a highly structured program that offers an alternative sanction for non-violent parole violators. In April 2020, in direct response to the COVID-19 Pandemic, IDOC Parole adopted the ability to conduct video face to face visits with our supervised population when home visits wer e not an option during the stay-at- home orders. Parole Agents can ensure our supervised individuals' needs are met during the pandemic. Video Visitation also known as BI Smart Link has proven to be a successful tool and Parole will continue to use this method of supervision for low level parolees post pandemic. The Parole Division completed development and implementation of a Risk Assessment Tool for individuals on parole. This Risk Assessment Tool ensures compliance with the 2009 Illinois Crime Reduction Act and will improve the supervision needs of those who are on parole. The individual's risk assessment score aids in the determination of what level of supervision is needed. Parole Agents are trained and complete risk assessments on all individuals who are currently on regular parole supervision. The Risk Assessment Tool has led to increased numbers of individuals recommended for early discharge from parole and has reduced the need of intense supervision while on Mandatory Supervised Release. Programs and Support Services Office of Adult Education and Vocational Services The mission of the Office of Adult Education and Vocational Services (OAEVS) is to enhance the quality and scope of education for individuals in custody within the Illinois Department of Corr ections (IDOC) consistent with age, commitments, and sentence by ensuring that the state and federal r esources are appropriately used in aiding committed persons to restore themselves to constructive and law-abiding lives in the community. OAEVS continues to provide quality educational opportunities to the population with the goal of increasing academic achievement. Education is vital to reducing recidivism and creating opportunities for individuals in custody to better themselves. OAEVS staff continues to work har d in assisting students in achieving their educational goals. Since January 1, 1987, all individuals committed to IDOC for two or mor e years, except those serving life sentences, take the Test of Adult Basic Education (TABE) to determine their academic level. Students are placed in academic and vocational programming based on TABE test score.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report11Library services are available throughout IDOC. Libraries offer a variety of recreational reading materials such as books, magazines, and newspapers. Individuals in custody have a constitutional right to access the court system. Law libraries are maintained and contain Federal and State of Illinois Constitutions, statutes, and court decisions. Resource materials help patrons research the law and prepare legal documents exercising their constitutional right of access to state and federal courts. Adult Basic Education (ABE) is a critical component in the education pr ogramming of OAEVS. ABE is mandatory for all individuals in custody scoring below 6.0 on the TABE test. Mandatory ABE students must attend a minimum of 90 days of instruction. The ABE core curriculum provides instruction in basic reading, writing, mathematics, and life skills. The program is designed to provide students with a base of skills and knowledge that will prepare them for additional academic/vocational instruction and subsequent employment. High School Equivalency (HSE), formally known as GED, is available to all individuals in custody who scor e an 8.0 or higher on a TABE test. OAEVS implements computer-based instruction and testing of HSE at all facilities. Post-secondary educational programming is vital in the rehabilitation of individuals in custody. College-level coursework was offered in many vocational areas such as Auto Body, Auto Mechanics, Barbering, Career Tech, Construction Occupations, Commercial Custodial, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Horticulture, Nail Tech, Restaurant Management, Warehousing, and Welding. These programs educate students in practical vocational applications allowing the hands-on training that can be carried on to the workfor ce upon release. College academic courses were offered that allowed students the opportunity to pursue an associate degree. Research indicates that the higher the level of education achievement, the lower the percentage of recidivism. OAEVS encourages all individuals in custody to participate in a degr ee earning program, with the goal of preparing them for employment upon release. The OAEVS continues to work with major colleges towards implementing 4-year degrees. FY21 was greatly impacted with COVID protocols. Attendance, achievement, and completion rates drastically decreased due to the lack of in-person classroom instruction. The goal of OAEVS is to provide high quality in person educational services to students in IDOC. Staffing is an issue and is expected to incr ease due to high waitlist numbers. OAEVS has increased the PSA, library and office staff positions while trying to keep the educator positions filled due to retirements and resignations. Education is a positive motivator for students. The waitlist has incr eased, which can be attributed a new law that took effect in 2018 and again in 2021 that allows more students to earn program sentence credit. The education program is the top producer of \"good time\" within IDOC.

Bush in 2003. The purpose of the Act was to \"provide for the analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape in Federal, State, and local institutions and to pr ovide information, resources, recommendations and funding to protect individuals from prison rape\". IDOC maintains a strict \"Zero Tolerance\" policy towards all forms of sexual abuse and sexual harassment; and provides guidelines for the prevention, detection, response, investigation, and tracking of all allegations. All allegations of sexual abuse and sexual harassment are taken seriously, investigated, and when applicable, referred for prosecution and/or discipline. While incarcerated within IDOC, the safety of the individuals in our custody is a primary concern; and that safety includes the right to be free from sexual abuse, harassment, and retaliation. During this fiscal year, the Department concentrated its efforts on staff training specific to PREA. Through an IDOC-initiated request for technical assistance from the National PREA Resource Center, the Department partnered with The Moss Group (TMG), a correctional consulting firm based out of Washington, DC. Utilizing a Bureau or Justice Assistance (BJA) grant, TMG assisted the Department in improving the accuracy of reporting of sexual abuse and sexual harassment allegations is accordance with PREA. Through collaboration with agency and facility leadership, current processes were examined, and recommendations and guidance were provided to increase data accuracy and reduce the need for investigations of allegations which do not meet the PREA definitions of sexual abuse and sexual harassment (\u00a7115.6). A concise narrated PowerPoint training and accompanying handout was created and has been distributed statewide to the Department's Shift Supervisors, upper and mid-level facility leadership, and staff directly involved in the PREA response protocol. The Department also initiated training to staff specific to the safety management and car e for those in our custody who identify as transgender. The training highlights the differences between Sex, Gender, and Sexual Orientation, as well as the unique needs of the transgender incar cerated population. The training also outlines proper PREA response and safety measures which may be deployed for our transgender population; and provides information regarding the negative impact of bias.

Ten students were slated to be part of the first group to participate. FY21 was a challenging year for all due to the pandemic and medical quarantines thr oughout IDOC. The Clinical team at EMCC did a great job continuing to meet the clinical needs of individuals in custody throughout the medical quarantines. With established safety precautions, the team maintained contact with individuals in custody to provide needed information, guidance, education, assessment, and referrals across the primary areas of vocational, family, social, personal, and re-entry needs. Through correspondence, the Clinical department continued to run Inside-Out Dads, Substance Abuse Education, and Aim Higher , which focus on cognitive restructuring, socialization, relapse prevention, problem solving, and relationship skills.

It is the only transition center for women in custody in Illinois. Residents reside in a 4-story building which houses up to 130 women. The building is centrally located on a main street in Aurora, Illinois. There is an outdoor recreation area and a covered patio for residents to enjoy. Women within 24 months of release who meet eligibility criteria transfer to Fox Valley ATC where they engage in in-house and community-based re-entry programming. Staff provide individual and group-based services which address each woman's unique social, medical, psychological, educational, and vocational needs using a strengths-based, gender-responsive approach. After completing a job readiness program, residents obtain full time employment and complete community service work. The overall recidivism rate for women in custody is approximately 24%. The recidivism rate for women in custody who complete the Fox Valley ATC transition program is 5%. Planning for successful family, community, and work force reintegration begins upon each resident's arrival. Using an integrated system of individualized screening, support, and services, as well as a four-step behavior level system, Fox Valley ATC offers a variety of programs specifically designed for women in custody. Counselors educate, motivate, and guide residents through the four-step level system that requires goals setting and achievement. At the highest level, residents earn the privilege of independent community and home pass movement. Through program participation and goals accomplishment, women build and strengthen their cognitive, social, educational, and vocational skills; subsequently becoming better pr epared for successful reintegration with their family, as well as the community and workforce. Financial stability and independence are an integral part of successful transition to the community. Many residents can save a substantial amount of money prior to their release. The average resident can save nearly $10,000 by the time she is paroled. Upon release, approximately 36% of residents maintain the employment they obtain while at Fox Valley ATC. In addition, approximately 30% of employed residents are Supervisors/Managers. On a frequent basis, residents are selected by their employers as Employee of the Month or Year. In addition to seeking gainful employment, residents are challenged to set and work towards accomplishing educational goals. COVID-19 brought about numerous changes to Fox Valley ATC's daily operations. During FY21, the facility was placed on quarantine and resident community movement was highly limited numerous times. In adherence with Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Contr ol guidelines, and under the direction of IDOC, Fox Valley ATC implemented myriad safety measures to maintain residents and staff safe including use of personal protective equipment, restricted movement within and outside of the facility, suspension of visits, social distancing, and enhanced cleaning and sanitation. Daily, staff and residents are screened and monitored closely for symptoms. Residents who may have been exposed were immediately quarantined and closely monitored. Symptomatic residents were isolated, tested in the community, and provided services as needed. Community movement limitation was a catalyst for implementation of peer led educational and r ecreational groups, as well as virtual educational and recreational virtual programming opportunities. Though in- person volunteer services were paused due to COVID-19, volunteers continued to play a key role in virtually complementing and augmenting resident services. Volunteers donated almost 2,000 hours of their time, as well as donations including clothing and shoes, hygiene items, items for the family visiting r oom, school supplies, books, and holiday toys for residents' children. Several Fox Valley ATC employees are active volunteers in their communities in areas that include social service advocacy groups, faith-based organizations, and military reserves. Staff members also participate in and donate to charitable events to raise money for Special Olympics, the American Cancer Society , suicide prevention, and Mutual Grounds, which serves survivors of domestic violence in the Aurora area.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report25Graham Correctional Center Graham Correctional Center opened in 1980 and is an adult medium security facility located in Hillsboro, Illinois.

Tours are conducted to encourage facility familiarity with key players from the local police, fire department, and hospitals. Hill Correctional Center Hill Correctional Center began FY21 with the challenge of a Medical Quarantine that took effect in June 2020, prior to the start of the Fiscal Year. The facility and IDOC faced unprecedented challenges in providing everything from commissary, food, hygiene, visits, and programming to individuals in custody. These challenges and improvements were a recurring theme throughout FY21, and staff and individuals in custody found themselves growing and adapting to a \"new normal\". The Command Center was opened with a full complement of staff running the COVID-19 Command Center beginning in June 2020 and continuing non-stop through July 30, 2021. Historians, media coordinators, operations commanders, tactical commanders, and incident commanders worked long hours to pr ovide continued updates to COVID-19 Central Command and to keep staff and individuals in custody awar e of quarantine statuses. Hill CC became the satellite quarantine area for Peoria ATC residents, monitoring their progress, and assisting the ATC in mitigation and recovery efforts. The facility developed tracking mechanisms for reporting purposes as well as exposure tracking. When vaccinations were announced, a joint effort between Health Care and Clinical Services to survey the population for vaccine numbers was initiated, resulting in the vaccination of 85% of individuals in custody. The National Guard was present for the first and second doses, and the facility provided accommodations and food for the servicemen and servicewomen. As cases increased, the knowledge of staff and individual in custody also increased. The Command Center was open for 10 months during FY21. The facility's Maintenance and Business Office cooperated on replacing light fixtures with high-efficiency LED bulbs, a Rapid Result project that was cost effective and efficient. Recycling efforts continued unabated with education on proper disposal of recyclable materials ongoing. The Adopt-A-Highway program was a success in October 2020, with staff picking up trash and debris on the highway in fr ont of the facility. Educational and Vocational Services offered classes via correspondence and mail, with several individuals in custody earning programming sentencing credit for their hard work and dedication. ABE, GED, and vocational courses were offered when applicable. Clinical Services ran programming via correspondence courses and added Corrections Assessment Specialists to the team. The Assessment Specialists were provided with a large Program/Assessment/Reentry Room in Spring 2021. Counselors toured housing units bi-weekly during the pandemic. The Assessment Specialists, Field Services, and Reentry Services areas of Clinical partnered on two Reentry Summits and provided distance opportunities to individuals paroling regarding resume building, job searches, and parole information. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report27Leisure Time Services provided movies to the population and increased in-cell activities for the population. Religious Services were suspended due to the pandemic, but the Chaplain provided religious materials to the individual in custody population. Industries at Hill CC focuses on providing skills needed to assist individuals in successful rehabilitation and re- entry into the community. The Hill CC Industries Program consists of three main segments: milk/juice Plant, meat Plant, and recycling. Individuals in custody are carefully guided by ICI supervisors and teach peers new skills, while learning techniques for success at the same time. To qualify as an ICI worker, individuals must demonstrate good behavior, be approved by the facility, and have the time left on their sentence to successfully complete the programming. Industries employed 30 individuals in custody in the milk plant, 26 individuals in custody in the meat plant, and 10 individuals in custody in recycling. Staff Wellness Response Team conducted weekly rounds and mindfulness reminders were sent out. Community Involvement was limited due to COVID-19 mitigations. Hill CC's FY21 was a great challenge to staff and individuals in custody, but it persevered and continue to do so.

Illinois River Correctional Center operated efficiently throughout FY21, minimalizing major incidents with attention to safety and security of the institution. COVID-19 safety, sanitation, and maintenance of the facility remains a focal point of daily operations, resulting in a safe, clean, and well-organized facility. Staff members were utilized as Correctional Trainee Screeners as well as serving in Statewide and Regional capacities in the areas of NeMat, Investigations and Intelligence, Special Operations TRT, Staff Wellness Response Team, and providing training in those areas at Concordia Court or regional settings. Illinois River's Tactical Staff has also assisted on several Tactical Team callouts throughout the year.

Along with library services the facility offers Adult Basic Education (ABE), Advanced Adult Basic Education (pr eGED), Adult Secondary Education (GED), and Career Awareness Bridge Program. During the Department's COVID-19 pandemic response, our Education Department developed different ways to engage with students and maintain access to education programming. Each educator developed packets based on student needs and handed out packets weekly. While handing out packets, educators were able to answer questions regarding schoolwork, good time, TABE testing, among other things. Our library staff tried to visit housing units daily to fulfill requests for general library books, notary services, legal copies, and pr ovide copies of case law for research. The library staff took advantage of having fewer patrons at a time in the library. They set up \"little libraries\" in every housing unit and one in the gymnasium. They also spent time r epairing books. They are also working on cataloging all books and updating their collections. They have cr eated a satellite library and law library in Restrictive Housing and the Maximum unit. Library clerks are individuals in custody with a specialized skill set, who can assist other individuals in custody with research and requests. Additional library services include photocopying of legal documents, use of typewriters, notarizing documents, e-filing to the U.S. District Courts, Legal Property Box Access, Indigent Supplies, and Lexis-Nexis Kiosks access.

Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report28The LTS department strives to provide a variety of leisure activities to all individuals in custody. This team of two under the guidance of Erin Tasker provide a robust calendar of activities for the population to enjoy. While the facilities activities schedule has looked different during the pandemic, our team thinks outside the box and comes up with activities, contests, trivia, and more. While many activities were restricted during COVID-19, the facility sponsored a track and field contest for each wing, soccer goal contest, weekly trivia contest with prizes, art contest, poster contest, 5K, crosswords and games, activities print-outs, in-room workout activities, and more. Erin Tasker served on a state-wide normalcy committee and many of the activities that Illinois River completed were passed on to other facilities offered state-wide. Illinois River was asked for assistance during the pandemic multiple times. With individual in custody support, we planned in-r oom yoga and meditation programming, recorded the programming, edited the videos, and provided those for placement on INN statewide. This was a great way for individuals in custody who coordinate and lead those activities regularly to share their knowledge and expertise. It also provided important stress-relief opportunities to individuals at other facilities. Two of our recordings were shown state-wide. One of LTS special projects this year was a picture project in celebration of Easter, Irish Heritage Month, and Women's History Month. During the pandemic in-person visits were stopped as a safety measure to reduce the potential deadly spread of the virus. While this was an important measure for everyone's safety, it was difficult on individuals in custody and their friends and families. During in-person visits one of the things that LTS can provide are photographs. This was one of the things most missed. Several individuals in custody r equested to be able to take photographs of themselves to send home during administrative tours. LTS came up with a creative plan to accomplish this task. Individuals in custody who were in A grade, had no ODRs for 90 days, and purchased photo tickets were able to send out to anyone up to 6 photographs and take up to 3 pr eapproved poses. While an artist did create a backdrop of a lake on a moonlit night, the most popular backdrop was an Easter Bunny. Many the individuals in custody chose to send these photographs to their children or mothers. This was such a popular program that it ran past the allotted time for it but was extended so every individual in custody who wanted to participate could. Illinois River Correctional Center is known for having some of the best artists. Many of the most popular art and craft classes are pencil drawings, painting, ceramics, and sketching. Throughout the year artists can participate in contests and display their artwork in the visiting room for individuals in custody, family and friends, staff, and official visitors to see and enjoy. Several of the contest winners have enjoyed the opportunity to refinish murals throughout the facility. The Illinois River Correctional Center's Health Care Unit was recognized by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care, upon recommendation of its Accreditation and Standards Committee, to have met all the requirements of accreditation under NCCHC's for Health Services. The Health Care Unit ensures all health services are provided including routine and emergency medical treatment, dental treatment, and psychological and psychiatric treatment services based on every individual's needs. Recently the nation-wide nursing shortage has significantly impacted Illinois River. Staffing issues are addressed with Wexford, the contractual provider, to fill current vacancies. Individuals in custody can request services for the doctor, mental health services, dental, eye doctor, physical therapy, or medical records. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report29A variety of Mental Health Services are provided with mental health programming is focused on individual needs and services. Mental Health staff provide group services on a variety of topics. including individual therapy, psychiatric services, psychotropic medication management, and groups. Psychoeducational groups focus on health and psychosocial issues and include problem solving skills/decision-making skills (setting and attaining goals, problem solving skills, addictive thinking, criminal thinking, values and responsibilities, making decisions, preparing for release), emotional management (anger, stress, anxiety, trauma, negative thought process, identifying triggers, coping), and interpersonal skill development (interpersonal skills, refusal skills, parenting skills and child development, conflict resolution, socialization). There are 227 SMI individuals in custody and 818 individuals in custody on the Mental Health Caseload with 487 being on the Psych Caseload at Illinois River Correctional Center. If an individual in custody is having a crisis, Crisis Team Members are available on every shift. The Chaplaincy Department facilitates growth or movement toward a meaningful, spiritual faith experience, and behavior according to the individuals in custody's faith orientation. Upon arriving at Illinois River Correctional Center individuals in custody can designate their religious affiliation and request for a religious diet or to request a special diet meal for the observance of a special holiday or cer emony. As part of the department's pandemic response volunteers were restricted from entering the facility. This significantly impacted religious services at the facility. The facility chaplain facilitated Angel Tree Program, Chapel Library, and religious requests. The chaplain conducts weekly tours in all housing units including the infirmary , the maximum unit, and restrictive housing providing structured out of cell time. The Clinical Services Department provides opportunities for individuals in custody conducive to rehabilitation. The Casework Supervisor assists in supervising Correctional Counselors, who are responsible for providing casework services. Direct services provided to the population should be responsive and appropriate to the needs of the individual. Clinical groups are held on a continuous basis when staffing and resources are available. These include a 12-Week Drug Education (exploring abuse, addiction, treatment, recovery & other issues), Parenting (focusing on parenting skills and responsibilities) and The Re-Entry Initiative (a comprehensive program designed to break the cycle of incarceration by providing groups that cover addiction, criminality, and consequences of choices, problem solving, substance abuse, self-esteem, as well as access to educational and vocational training and employment opportunities, lifestyle redirection, and parole school). Field Services Staff assists individuals in custody with parole plans and release issues including securing identification documents through Social Security. Illinois River Correctional Center's Rehab & Re-entry Program was established, and participants were chosen for this pilot program who had the greatest risk for recidivism. A vital part of the success of this program included program mentors. Mentors were required to have a staff recommendation, complete an application, and participate in a scored interview process. The highest scoring individuals were then chosen to go through the training to be certified as mentors. Once certified, these Mentors wer e able to provide other program participants with peer-led programming which included Anger Management, Conflict Resolution, Criminal Thinking, Mindfulness, Change & Success, Effective Communication, Relationship Skills, Self-Management, Leadership Skills, and Life Skills. The program was set up to be completed in four phases. The first phase was peer-led programming, the second phase is staff led Cognitive Behavioral Change programs including Building Change, Start Now, Inside Out Dads, Drug Awareness, and Drug Education. Phase three focuses on vocational programming and skill building. Phase four is reconnecting to community in preparation for release. The focus is on building bridges and repairing or strengthening relationships with friends and loved ones. Due to COVID-19, participants were unable to complete all portions of the program as not just the facility, but the state shut down for the safety of residents both inside the facility walls and outside. Celebrations that were planned with outside sources had to be cancelled as volunteers were not allowed in. Presentations from different organizations had to be help via Web-ex rather than in-person. A presentation from a returning citizen was rescheduled multiple times. The hard work of the participants did not go unrecognized, however. With the Department's refocus on filling Adult Transition Centers, many participants were able to be submitted for placement at work release. Many participants were screened to transfer to Kewanee for participation in the Life Skills and Re-entry Center. Several other participants were chosen for transfer to minimum facilities. All mentors were able to participate in the Global Leadership Summit and the facility will continue to provide them with leadership opportunities.Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report30Data collected showed a 66% reduction in tickets in program participants overall. Mentors alone had a 33% reduction in tickets. The total tickets received by all participants in the year prior to participation was 421. The total tickets received during the year of participation was 142. Operating under the direction that moderate risk individuals in custody receive 100-199 hours and high-risk individuals in custody receive 200+ hours of programming for effective change the total number of programming hours for this program equaled 29,627 hours. 23,971 of those hours were facilitated by clinical services staff. 5656 hours were mentor led programming hours. Per participant this averaged 53.6 mentor led dosage hours and 200.3 Cognitive Behavioral Therapy dosage hours by staff. The Re-entry Resource Center at Illinois River Correctional Center was established and includes a storage area, a restroom, office space for the Correctional Counselor III to work, an individual assessment area, a resource space where materials are kept, a bank of three computers for individual in custody use, classroom space, presentation area, and a heavy equipment simulator. Illinois River Correctional Center allows every individual in custody who is getting ready to return to society the opportunity to conduct job searches, write a resume, sign up for benefits on ABE such as SNAP and Medicaid, and conduct searches relevant to re-entry. his area has quickly become very popular for the individuals in custody. Not only is this a sign that they are one step closer to reuniting with their friends and loved ones, but it also gives them valuable tools and resources to ease their transition. Illinois Correctional Industries program employs individuals in custody who obtain hands-on experience in jobs ranging from production of sweet goods, management of supplies and warehousing, and complex accounting principles and bookkeeping skills through completion of many financial processes and reports. Many workers have completed a Department of Labor sponsored Apprenticeship Program and/or are forklift certified through our OSHA forklift training program. Even though production has been modified during the department's pandemic response to COVID-19, four industry workers completed the Department of Labor Apprenticeship for the occupation of Baker, passed all required tests, and were able to successfully complete the required hours. Nicholas Crayton completed the Department of Labor Apprenticeship for Office Manager/Administrative Services. He passed all tests pertaining to accounting principles and most recently was able to assist in cost accounting for the product line and quarterly surveys. Illinois River Correctional Center has participated in Law Enforcement Torch Run (LETR) fundraising for many years. As part of the efforts, Illinois River continued its participation in the annual Cop on a Rooftop at Dunkin Donuts. The facility expanded its partnerships to include the Fulton County Sheriff's Office, Canton Police Department, Farmington Police Department, Lewistown Police Department, Canton Park District, and our local celebrity Special Olympics Athletes. Another popular event was the Golf Scramble at local Wee-Ma-Tuk Hills Country Club. This event alone raised over $5,000. Illinois River Correctional Center continued to make a great impact during the annual State and University Employees Combined Appeal (SECA) campaign. We had five fundraisers that ran during the campaign, ranging from breast cancer awareness to raising money for animals.

Individuals in custody utilize biodegradable mulch made from cardboard, and produce their own compost from garden waste, grass clippings, eggshells and used coffee grounds. In FY21, the gardening program produced over 8,000 pounds of produce, which was used by Dietary to provide fresh, nutritional meals for individuals in custody and staff.

In April 2021, Du Quoin Impact Incarceration Program was reformed, now titled Du Quoin Structured Impact Program, and is temporarily being operated in an area of Murphysboro Life Skills Re-Entry Center due to staffing levels. At different times since March 2020, MLSRC operated under a modified administrative quarantine protocol. The dorm and bunk style living quarters make it unique to most other facilities thr oughout the state. Movement was still allowed, but under altered procedures. Strict cleaning regimens were implemented in all areas with daily cleaning logs being completed. Masks are distributed weekly for residents to wear. Upon entry into the facility, all staff must have their temperature taken and are issued a new mask daily for use. Routine COVID-19 testing was implemented along with COVID-19 vaccination clinics for staff and individuals in custody . Murphysboro LSRC's garden program is a highlight of the facility. The produce harvested is utilized in dietary for residents and staff and is very well received by all. The maintenance department's preventative maintenance throughout the facility keeps up with the best cost saving measures addressing small issues before they become larger, more expensive problems. The education department seeks to assist residents in acquiring critical life skills such as job acquisition and retention, functional literacy, high school equivalency, and other such skills that will allow them to be financially independent, clear in communication, and responsible in relationships. The educators are continually creating and offering new classes for the students, who show great interest in their education. COVID-19 restrictions and guidelines altered the way the students pursued their learning while the epidemic was in full swing. Educators made correspondence packets for coursework when all in-person classes were suspended. As the in-person class restrictions were lifted, students could get back in the classrooms, but the class sizes were greatly reduced to maintain compliance with CDC guidelines. Still, in this time, eight students ear ned their GED certificates. Lake Land College offers valuable vocational courses in Construction Management, Manufacturing, and Horticulture. These courses are in high demand for the students as they provide tangible, real-world, hands-on experiences that are beneficial in a myriad of ways. The Construction Management instructor has developed a relationship with the city of Murphysboro and has helped refurbish and build multiple portable structures for use during the city's annual Apple festival and other community events. During FY21, with COVID-19 restrictions not allowing Lake Land staff to enter the facility on a regular basis for instruction, progress was still made for some students through correspondence work.

There are numerous religious services actively held each month for various religions including Non- denominational Christian, Jehovah's Witness, and Al-Islam. Currently, there are three regular chapel volunteers participating in religious services and/or leading religious studies. The Chaplain has an open-door policy for staff and residents. This lends itself to many daily opportunities to provide spiritual counsel to both staff and residents at their convenience. MLSRC has a significantly smaller staffing level than a typical IDOC facility . The staff tries their best to take care of one another. Other ways to boost staff morale and bonding included some unique ways to engage in friendly competition. There was facility wide 'Easter egg hunts', guess how many objects are in the container games, and pumpkin carving contests, just to name a few. Several staff are also trained members of the SWRT and are available. The facility also hosted three American Red Cross Blood Drives. Although that was fewer drives than in past years, our staff still donated 70 lifesaving units. Staff were also generous giving to causes within the facility during our SECA campaign. They donated clothing to the facility clothes closet that goes to men upon their release, puzzles and games to the library, musical equipment, and various other supplies that benefit the residents of MLSRC. A new program instated in April 2021 became a powerful learning tool at MLSRC. Residents can apply to job openings in the facility by filling out and submitting applications to vacant jobs that ar e posted. Interviews are scheduled for each job applicant and are held by a panel of staff members. Candidates are interviewed and the staff members rate them on a multitude of variables including confidence, eye contact, etiquette, answering all parts of the questions, and more. Constructive feedback is given to each applicant after the interview process to help them understand their strengths and weaknesses and how to improve for future interviews.

North Lawndale Adult Transition Center The North Lawndale Adult Transition Center (NLATC) is a 200-bed facility operated by the Safer Foundation for adult male persons in the custody of IDOC. It is located on the Westside of Chicago, within walking distance of its sister facility, Crossroads ATC. To be transferred to an ATC usually requires a parole date that does not exceed 24 months. Within the last year, the facility experienced several significant changes based on the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic, which began in March 2020. In April 2020, NLATC was placed on medical quarantine status due to residents and staff testing positive for COVID-19. To mitigate the spread of the virus, extensive efforts were made to reduce the resident population. All programs and services including work, passes, school, visits, and volunteer services were placed on hold to reduce exposure and spread of the virus. The intake of new residents was suspended as part of the agency's response to COVID-19, and protocols were implemented to distribute Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) to residents and staff. The use of hygiene techniques and cleaning standards were developed to prevent the spread of the virus. Due to the facility being placed on medical quarantine and residents being unable to leave the building, policies were developed which allowed residents to telephone home to maintain contact with family members and significant others. Temperature checks for all staff and residents entering the building was implemented to detect exposure to the virus. IDOC issued daily updates to keep staff informed regarding knowledge of how the virus was spread and best practices for keeping staff and residents safe. Illinois Department of Corrections | FY21 Annual Report42The enormous challenge with the onset of the pandemic was how to continue the basic operations safely and responsibly, while taking all necessary measures to ensure that the virus would not pose a threat for either residents or staff. Initially, NLATC had five cases of COVID-19 for residents and four for staff. The residents who were exposed were temporarily transferred to Stateville Correctional Center to be monitored by medical staff prior to returning to the facility once they were medically cleared. Throughout this crisis, there was a focus on maintaining the level of programming to the greatest extent possible. Although no residents were permitted to work or take passes outside of the facility without staff escort, the use of video conferencing software such as Zoom allowed residents to participate in various activities safely and remain in contact with persons in the outside world. \"Reading Between the Lines,\" long a part of North Lawndale's volunteer program and dedicated to improving residents' critical thinking skills, volunteered to provide tablets and headphones to the facility. They resumed their program within weeks of the quarantine. With the guidance and support of IDOC and the Safer Foundation, North Lawndale ATC continues to work through the crisis that COVID-19 has placed in our path. We continue to place the health and safety of our residents and staff as our top priority and seek innovative ways of implementing programming services to residents. Peoria Adult Transition Center Peoria Adult Transition Center (ATC) is a reentry/work release facility for male residents located in downtown Peoria. The current population at Peoria Adult Transition Center (ATC) is 178 with a capacity for 248 residents.

Residents that arrived at the PATC as exception to criteria, residents with Murder or Class X cases, now can learn the skills necessary for successful re-entry into the community. Exception to criteria residents with 85% and 100% cases have been incarcerated for more than 20 years. These residents come to Peoria ATC with a chance to re-start their lives and careers with employment opportunities. All PATC Residents are given an opportunity to enroll in programming towards their GED or college degree before reentering the community. Most residents can work and save their income to set up their own parole sites with lease agreements for apartments and houses in the Peoria area where they remain employed. Clinical actively works to build relationships with local employers and has formed trust with employers like Caterpillar to except our exception to criteria residents for employment. This fiscal year, Peoria ATC reviewed its financial policies and the banking industry. The financial industry has shifted from paper payroll checks to direct deposit, writing checks to swiping cards, and cash handling to Venmo. While the changes were gradual, it is apparent that it's not a gradual change for our residents. To provide our residents with the tools needed to be financially literate when they parole from our facility, we developed the Banking Initiative. The goal is to provide support and education to residents about the changes in the banking industry while they are in an environment where they can ask questions and get the support they need from staff, our peer support resident, or our financial institution. As part of the initiative, residents can open one outside bank account and use all the available features of the account (mobile banking, online bill pay, paperless statements, debit card, etc.). Additionally, if a resident needs to work on repairing their credit, they can apply for a secured credit card. The Business Office is available to discuss budgeting, cash advances, and banking options. Statements are requested once a month, allowing Business Office staff to evaluate any unspoken needs the residents may have regarding their accounts such as minimum balance concerns, cash advances, or overdrafts.

use of the institution has changed over time (i.e., security level is different, population may have housed juveniles or a different gender, primary role of the facility regarding program services has been altered, etc.) 2Expenditures among satellite facilities cannot be extracted from parent facilities as administrative, dietary, medical, staffing, service costs, etc. are shared. Also, the expenditures here only include correctional facilities; some expenditures such as parole, general office, and shared services, etc. are not included. The FY20 GRF total expenditures for the Department of Corrections were $1,279,409,838. 3Per capita costs are calculated as expenditures divided by average daily population (ADP). For the same reasons listed in footnote #1, the historical intra- and inter-institution comparisons are affected. Further, per capita costs are a function of economies of scale which further limits an objective comparison between correctional sites; especially higher security level sites or sites with a small number of individuals. 4Elgin Treatment Center is a mental health inpatient treatment facility that opened on April 2, 2018; it's parent facility is Joliet Treatment Center. 5Joliet Treatment Center is a multi-disciplinary treatment facility that opened on October 6, 2017. 6Murphysboro Life Skills Re-Entry Center opened on April 16, 2018; it's parent facility is Pinckneyville Correctional Center.
