Dr. Dean Ornish Meditation and Mind-Body Medicine Teacher Training has been specifically designed to allow you to experience lifestyle medicine as attainable practices of compassionate connection with ourselves and others. While there is an explicit focus on mindfulness and meditation processes, this specialty intensive training elective shall cover both Yogic and Buddhist practices, making it perfect for those beginning their journey in either yoga or meditation teacher training. Your journey into Mind-Body Medicine shall begin to explore the biopsychosocial model of health and well-being. We shall endeavour to impart foundational knowledge based on how all aspects of the mind-body directly affect who we are and how we live. Beginning with the science of the embodied brain and an understanding of illness and disease, including paradigms of inflammatory conditions, degenerative diseases, chronic pain, mental illness, and the like, you will find yourself beginning to conceptualize illness and disease from a new perspective. This perspective will encompass a holistic and evidence-informed knowledge base of root causation from both an eastern (Ayurveda) and a western (BioMedical) perspective. Your journey will continue over four days, immersing you in a rich education of mindfulness and meditation practices for managing and overcoming states of disease - both physical and psychological. You will be introduced to a world of medicine where the mind and body are not seen as separate systems but rather a harmonious balance of affect and effect. Most inspiringly, you shall not only come away with a knowledge base of biopsychosocial health and well-being, so too you shall be immersed in your practices for exploring human potential, heart-felt intuition, and creating positive, meaningful intent, as well as how to support the body's natural healing processes, and therapeutic modalities for mind-body self-care, hosted by some of the most prominent experts in their fields. And, when your immersion into the world of mind-body medicine comes to an end, you shall find that you have been imparted with the knowledge of how to develop clear and healthy lifestyle goals for living a full and meaningful life with mindfulness and compassion as well as how to cultivate healthy relationships and compassionate boundaries - both professionally and personally. Whether you do this course for yourself or to teach others, it is a highly valuable practice to live by and share with others. Meditation is an innovative lifestyle medicine of the 21st century. Meditation as Lifestyle Medicine is taught by the Founder and Director of Biyome, Celia Roberts. This retreat is run similar to what you may find in Theravada monasteries of South East Asia. In this retreat training, we take the time to focus on some classically strong seated practice, with walking meditation practiced true to its form and origins. This retreat will follow similar daily routines to a monastic retreat with periods of silence and seated meditation. The practice will be coupled with scientific research, spiritual discussion, and theory. Students in the past have found this four-day silent meditation intensive to be life-changing, despite its intensity, finding themselves very able to dive deeply into the spiritual healing practice, interspersed with science. Below is the daily schedule. There are many comfortable ways to practice seated meditation, and Celia will be there to guide your practice at every step.
