Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture unlike Botox, which carries a large number of possible side effects, is known to be highly effective, totally natural, non toxic, non chemical, anti-ageing treatment that aims to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture can influence the health of the skin, working on more than the superficial signs of premature ageing and, as whole face is treated and as body points are also used, patient entire health and wellbeing can be greatly improved! Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture helps to stimulate the FIBROBLAST cells, that lie deep within the dermis layer of the skin. As result of that it it promotes the production of new COLLAGEN and ELASTIN - the key building blocks of the skin that naturally deplete with age. Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture is a great alternative for individuals who want a natural and organic approach to looking younger while improving their overall health. It is safe, natural and effective alternative to Botox, less expensive and without the post-treatment downtime. Appearance changes are natural, not as drastic or sudden. After undertaking series of treatments, one can feel healthier, sleep better, be less anxious and feel more balanced! Featured on Channel 4 TV series such as '10 Years Younger' and 'How Not to Get Old', a Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture treatment will concentrate on points and muscles of the face in order to improve elasticity of your skin and general overall appearance. Acupuncture has been around for thousands of years and although relatively new to the West the Chinese have been using points on the face to combat the signs of ageing and to help with various skin conditions for many years. It was in use as early as the Song Dynasty (960AD - 1279AD) when the Empress and Emperor's concubines received Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture. It is a great choice not only for Empresses but for everyone! How does it work - The science behind Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture Your internal state of health is reflected on your face but in order to achieve the desirable effect the practitioner performing Facial [Cosmetic Acupuncture](https://www.wellstreamacupuncture.com/acupuncture-treatment.html) should also always incorporate body points and as such create a dual treatment for the patient. If only large number of needles are chosen and insert in the face area and not the full body, this will always result in energy congestion in the face! A patient can experience dullness, headache, and discomfort but when we start with the body points, one can experience a full flow of energy that helps support the Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture. On the face, the Acupuncturist will insert 40 to 70 tiny and painless needles. As the needles puncture the skin, they create wounds within its threshold, which are called positive micro-traumas. When the body senses these wounds, it goes into repair mode. This is the same idea micro-needling uses to get bright, anti-aging results \u2014 except Acupuncture is a bit less intense, averaging about 50 punctures. Micro-needling applies hundreds of pricks through a rolling device. These punctures stimulate your lymphatic and circulatory system, which work together to deliver nutrients and oxygen to your skin cells, nourishing skin from the inside out. This helps even out your complexion and promote your skin's glow. The positive micro-traumas also stimulates the production of collagen. This helps improve elasticity, minimising fine lines and wrinkles. . Benefits of Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture - Promotion of the production of collagen and elastin - Improvement of fine lines & wrinkles - Improvement with age spots and old acne scars - Improvement of laughter lines around the mouth and eyes - Improvement of drooping eyelids - Improvement of bags under the eyes - Radiant looking skin - Helps in the treatment of acne and other skin conditions - Improve Complexion - Even Skin Tone, but also - It can be very useful for emotional release and stress management, facial trauma, and Anxiety symptoms - Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture will improve in general your health and wellbeing! How many treatments will I need & is there any evidence of effectiveness? Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture is a truly fantastic treatment! It's as though the skin has been awakened from a long, deep sleep, as all the fresh blood and oxygen flood the face and really bring it back to life. Unlike Botox or dermal fillers, Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture isn't a quick fix of any kind. The focus is to create long-term changes in the health of the skin and body, not short-term quick fixes (better collagen stimulation, a brightened skin tone, reduced jaw tension, and a softer appearance overall on top of health benefits like reduced anxiety and tension). Studies published in the International Journal of Clinical Acupuncture in 1996 showed that of 300 people who received Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture, 90% demonstrated marked results after only their first few treatments. The clinical outcome was: improvement in skin texture and complexion, increased elasticity, reduction of depth of wrinkles and overall sense of wellbeing. Further research: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3745857/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3745857/) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26850796](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26850796) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6113042/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6113042/) I recommend 10 treatments once or twice a week to see optimum results. After that, patient goes into a \"maintenance stage,\" where one can get the treatment every four to eight weeks. What is Low Level Light Therapy and Celluma Lamp? Early NASA research proved that specific wavelengths of light could enhance human tissue at the cellular level, resulting in a wide variety of therapeutic benefits. In more recent years, light therapy has become a mainstream method of treatment for acne, ageing, and pain. In the same way that plants use chlorophyll to convert sunlight into plant tissue, human cells can absorb specific wavelengths of light and transform their energy into adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the form of energy that cells use to power metabolic processes. Simply put, light therapy improves cellular health by accelerating the repair and replenishment of compromised tissue cells. Celluma Light therapy can increase circulation, accelerate tissue repair, kill acne bacteria, decrease inflammation, improve skin tone, and also ease muscle and joint pain, stiffness, spasm, and arthritis. How can Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture be used in conjunction with Low Level Light Therapy? Acupuncture and light therapy are both non-invasive, natural treatments that can naturally improve the body's own healing abilities, helping us look and feel our best. When Acupuncture is used in conjunction with light therapy, patients will first experience those micro-traumas that bring a rush of blood, oxygen, and nutrients to the skin's surface. Then, with the application of light energy, cells are stimulated on the microscopic level, increasing the production of collagen and elastin, and increasing cell turnover. Acupuncture creates inflammation - it's all part of the healing process. But when used in conjunction with light therapy, light therapy works to reduce that inflammation and provide additional cellular energy, so patients look and feel better more quickly after treatment. Treating patients with Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture and Light Therapy Light therapy enhances the benefits of Traditional Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture - that's a scitific fact! Pairing Facial Cosmetic Acupuncture with Celluma light therapy enhances patient outcomes for acne, ageing, pain, and general health and wellness. When used in conjunction with Acupuncture, light therapy can: - Stimulate skin cell micro-circulation - Improve lymphatic drainage - Soften wrinkles and fine lines - Increase collagen and elastin production - Delay the signs of aging - Relax and rejuvenate clients - Produce efficient, effective results with no downtime Why do you like to use Celluma Light Therapy during the treatment? I have chosen to use Celluma for my practice because Celluma is the only all-in-one, FDA-cleared light therapy device on the market and has been proven to promote cell proliferation and cell migration using blue, red and near-infrared wavelengths synergistically. Additionally Celluma Pro received from European Union CE-Marking for Dermal Wound Healing! Celluma devices also offer different treatment modes, so they can be used for acne, anti-aging, and pain management. What's more, Celluma's unique ability to conform closely to the treatment area allows for maximum absorption of light, so you'll see more effective, faster results with Celluma when compared to other light therapy devices. According to the Inverse Square Law of Optical Physics, as you double the distance between skin and light energy, the energy available for absorption decreases by 4 times. That means if you position Celluma .5 inch away from skin and another device is 1 inch away, that second device would need to be 4x as powerful to have the same effect. *** It's a great treatment for those who are really busy and on the go, as it allows the body time to relax "}
